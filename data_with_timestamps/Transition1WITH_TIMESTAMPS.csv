233.7,separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is thesis thesis makes custom nootropics and as ,1
252.12,many of you know I'm not a fan of the word nootropics because nootropics means smart drugs and as a neuroscientist I can tell you there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart thesis understands this and has designed different nootropics in order to bring your brain into specific States for specific types of work so for instance ,1
476.28,and I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding again that's livemomentis.com huberman let's talk about headaches and as we are soon going to learn there are different types of headaches and different types of headaches arise from changes in different types of tissues in the head ,1
672.18,of which are very thin and fragile and others of which such as the dura that are very very strong because they're very fibrous almost like a uh if you've ever felt for instance the sale of a of a sailboat you might think oh it's just this big flapping sheet in the wind it is anything but a sheet in the Wind it is a very very strong and durable ,1
1044.12,inflammation of a tissue is one way in which a set of cells so these could be for instance uh cells of the immune system and we cover this in a detailed episode all about the immune system if you'd like to check that out you go to hubermanlab.com just put into our search function immune system and you can find that episode by the way all of our ,1
1064.6,episodes are searchable by keyword hubermanlab.com and it'll take you to specific episodes and time stamps for the topics you're interested in so for sake of this discussion about headache inflammation is going to be the case when one particular tissue in and around the head area is releasing molecules cytokines which sometimes are called ,1
1506.78,happen in your body like your heart beats or you move your limbs you lift your eyelids or your eyebrows rather and so on and so forth other types of neurons are what we call Sensory neurons they communicate the same way that motor neurons do that is they fire what we call Action ,1
1525.08,potentials which are just electrical signals they release neurotransmitters like any other neuron but they respond to certain events in the environment or the environment within the body but they are not responsible for generating muscular contractions so we call these Sensory neurons some Sensory neurons sense light touch other Sensory ,1
1867.62,based type treatments and they would rather use for instance a behavioral approach in which they can modulate they can deliberately turn off the communication between Sensory neurons and motor neurons and turns out those approaches exist as well okay so at this point I promise you that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology ,1
1884.779,lesson in terms of pain sensing and headaches as a more uh conceptual phenomenon instead what I'd like to do next is talk about the different types of headaches and I think this is something that's very important and not often discussed except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of ,1
1942.679,in the area above the eyes often also include the jaw the neck muscles and can extend even into the upper back again this can be caused by some low level of infection but more often than not tension type headaches are going to come on because of some chronic psychological stress usually combined with lack of sleep usually combined with ,1
1959.0,lifestyle issues and of course without getting into a long discussion about it anytime you have lack of sleep you're going to have excessive stress anytime you have excessive stress you're going to have to make sure you're offsetting that by getting proper sleep most people don't when they're under excessive stress by the way we have excellent ,1
2168.579,episode you will find for instance that 17 of women suffer from migraines you will also hear that six percent of males suffer from migraines you will also hear that 43 43 percent of females suffer from migraine that is recurring headaches that qualify as migraine headaches and that ,1
2187.78,17 percent of men suffer from migraine headaches on a recurring basis which is again the definition of a migraine headache or one of the key definitions so all we can say for sure is that many many millions of people maybe even billions of people suffer from migraine headaches it's kind of a staggering thing to contemplate but we know it's ,1
2546.82,then give us the experience of extreme headache and migraine so taking an aspirin or something like it for migraine in some cases the worst possible Choice again so knowing what kind of headache you are experiencing is going to be essential here the other thing that you'll sometimes hear is that drinking a cup of coffee or getting ,1
2564.94,caffeine through tea is a great way to deal with headache why would that be well it turns out that coffee can cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation depending on when you take it and we'll get into the use of caffeine as a treatment for headache because indeed it can be a very potent treatment for headache but you ,1
2708.22,actually can be quite dangerous if you have an infection of the eye of a herpes infection in the eye you should see an ophthalmologist or the nose region they can experience pain in the mucosal tissue of the nose more often than not the most inflammation is occurring on the the branch that innervates the lip or the region close to the lip and ,1
2727.06,that's why a cold sword develops there an immune response there signaling that there's inflammation due to the herpes virus which lives on that neuron for a very long time neurons don't turn over in the lifespan so it can live on there for the extent of of the person's life however most people hopefully treat their HSV-1 but if they ,1
3347.579,unquote knocked out but sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion most traumatic brain injury and concussion and low-level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living that is lowered cognition disruption and mood ,1
3786.42,is creatine now creatine as many of you know is something that people supplement and take most often creatine is discussed in the context of muscle performance not just for people who weightlift but for people who do endurance exercise and it's often been said that 5 to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate depending on how ,1
4107.96,creatine over and over day to day that there's a buildup of creatine stores both in the muscles and within the brain tissue now what they found as a consequence of this creatine Administration was really striking and I think quite exciting they found a very significant decrease in the frequency of headache in people that were ,1
4162.319,again the results are very impressive what they found is that the number of people experiencing dizziness was significantly reduced in people supplementing with creatine as was the number of people experiencing fatigue and acute fatigue and chronic fatigue again not chronic fatigue syndrome per se but chronic fatigue which was in this ,1
4182.779,study defined as a general sense of bodily weakness and even mental weakness mental weakness is a little bit hard to quantify but they were very careful to distinguish between cognitive and mental fatigue versus physical and somatic fatigue they acknowledge that both of those occur in TBI or post-tbi the headache is quite frequent basically the ,1
4315.26,effects were dramatic enough that people with headache and in particular people with TBI ought to consider supplementing with creatine in order to deal with their headaches and of course I eagerly await other studies exploring the role of this high dosage of creatine which is a relatively high dosage of creatine monohydrate for offsetting headache ,1
4330.88,meanwhile I think there are a number of people out there suffering from headache who might consider using creatine monohydrate in an exploratory fashion and seeing whether or not it helps offset their headaches keep in mind of course anytime you're going to add or remove anything supplement or otherwise from your from ,1
4979.159,migraine and this was a randomized control trial randomized control trials involve having people be in one condition where they do one thing and then they get swapped randomly into another condition so they serve as their own internal control and that controls for all sorts of things like differences in sex differences in age differences in ,1
5002.14,health background in any number of other variables as best as one can in this study they had people either ingest a diet that had increased Omega-3s so increased EPA and DHA or increased EPA and DHA and reduced amounts of linoleic acid okay so that's going to reduce omega-6s ,1
5382.06,run out and get the prescription form of omega-3 fatty acids they're actually quite hard to obtain and quite expensive but because I think oftentimes when we're talking about something like omega-3 fatty acids the fact that they are available over the counter in a supplement or by liquid or available in food for that matter ,1
5399.52,leads many people to conclude that oh you know this is supplementation this is something that um you know it's going to have relatively weak or minor impact on things like headache or other health metrics but let's just say that the fact that it exists as a prescription drug and its highest potency form at least in ,1
5811.06,sunlight sunlight includes a huge range of wavelengths including long wavelength light of course you've seen that as the Reds and oranges in the sunset and so on those intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the eye respond best to bright green or blue light and they send connections to a bunch of different places in the brain ,1
6166.8,headache so what happens is they start to experience some Aura some onset of photophobia and then the photophobia itself leads to this feeling of malaise that then converts into headache and so while there are not a lot of clinical data on this just yet an emerging idea in the realm of headache treatment is the idea that if you can offset some of ,1
6489.48,Botox arises from or is rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin is a toxin that's found in canned goods not all canned goods of course and what it does is it it prevents a certain step in the release of so-called neurotransmitter in the little packets that they live in which are called ,1
6505.5,vesicles little little spheres of neurotransmitter live at the end of neuron nerve Terminals and are released onto the muscle make the muscle contract botulinum neurotoxin Cleaves a particular protein in there for you aficionados who want to look this up it's a really cool mechanism it Cleaves something called Snap 25. Snap 25 is ,1
6856.619,are in the paper for you to peruse online through the link I mentioned before so they had four different groups they had one group apply peppermint oil but that peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil they had another group used just peppermint oil they had another group use just tiny traces of peppermint oil and smaller ,1
6879.42,doses of eucalyptus oil and then they had a fourth group which was just using Placebo when I say using what they were doing is they were sponge applying the oil to the temples and forehead of people and then what they did is they used these different approaches to measure the activation of muscles to measure pain and they then induced head ,1
7620.0,red light to offset photophobia in conjunction with any number of different treatments either prescription or otherwise so I do want to make that clear and I especially want to make that clear as I transition to the next segment where I'm going to tell you about herbal treatments for migraine and this is based on what I consider a very ,1
7839.48,the head indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction by preventing that adenosine pathway that would normally lead to vasoconstriction and you can get some relief from that headache however caffeine is also a vasodilator caffeine has the ability to impinge on the so-called no pathway the nitric oxide pathway which is a nerve to ,1
8129.46,day now I want to be very clear I do not recommend that anyone take dosages of curcumin an AKA turmeric that are that high why well curcumin and turmeric not only are anti-inflammatory but they also can impinge on other Pathways in particular hormonal Pathways and in fact curcumin AKA turmeric can alter the synthesis of ,1
8150.34,something called dihydrotestosterone dihydrotestosterone is involved in an enormous range of different bodily functions it's involved in libido it's involved in Men in beard growth and in the regulation of a number of different tissues both in the reproductive axis and outside the reproductive axis and curcumin is a potent inhibitor of DHT so ,1
8506.859,which is a brutal headache and sadly in his case um permanent brain damage so loss of neuronal tissue because neuronal tissue is very metabolically active you cut off the blood supply to that tissue Not only would you feel miserable maybe even pass out but lose vision and certain brain areas will actually die off in the absence of blood flow to ,1
8529.18,those areas we know this more commonly as stroke so I don't want to strike fear in anybody about eating a you know a jalapeno or even a very spicy meal from time to time but if you're not somebody who's familiar with eating very spicy foods you certainly don't want to enter one of these competitions and just realize that the pathways from Menthol ,1
8609.819,trying to alleviate those headaches or prevent them from happening at all we talked about tension headaches migraine headaches hormone-based headaches cluster headaches and traumatic brain injury related headaches we talked about different types of treatments ranging from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation some herbal and indeed ,1
8628.12,some essential oil treatments as well as acupuncture all of which have been shown to have significant impact in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches and in many cases reductions in the frequency and intensity of headaches that are at least as great as the results they're seen with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs again I want to ,1
8727.72,episode and on many previous episodes of The huberman Lab podcast we discuss supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like improving sleep hormone support and focus huberman Lab podcast has partnered with momentous supplements because momentous supplements are of the ,1
8743.859,very highest quality and they include single ingredient formulations this is very important as I pointed out in the episode about a rational approach to supplementation single ingredient formulations allow you to develop the most biologically effective and cost-effective approach to supplementation in addition momentous ,1
