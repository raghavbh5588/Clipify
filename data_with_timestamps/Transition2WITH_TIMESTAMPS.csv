653.279,um other biological markers Associated that you want to pay attention to the high glycemic index meal and they looked at those immediately an hour three hours six hours as opposed and it was very clear that same intervention was able to improve post-planned yell glucose control insulin and a whole bunch of other factors in addition to that so if ,1
674.339,you are the sort of type who's like wow I'm in an office all day maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal not the best approach but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up a flight of stairs or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds so there's a lot of magic and power and maximal exertion ,1
838.86,quickly it doesn't require sweating doesn't require anything else there's no warm-up associated with it again you need a minute break in between meetings or whatever and you can Sprint up them I do this all the time in my house when you you know have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms Etc you can get out of 20 seconds I run ,1
857.04,to my garage which is over there I hop on the the airbike and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in love it yeah I'm gonna start yeah just also you can just put one of those things which I do also just put one in your office and hop over right over there you know ,1
1071.6,getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science-backed ratio of 1 000 milligrams that's one gram of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's lmnt.com huberman to get a free ,1
1092.12,element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lmnt.com huberman to claim a free sample pack so tell me about endurance what is endurance how do I get more endurance and how does it work when we think about endurance I would like to open up the conversation to include more things than people ,1
1358.52,I promise and I want to ask you a very simple question how do you lose weight I was taught that the calories in calories out thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything that is if I'm ingesting less caloric energy than I burn ,1
1379.34,then I'm going to lose weight and if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn I'll maintain weight and if I ingest more then I burn then I'll gain weight sure that is the approach you would take what I'm asking really is how are you actually physically losing the weight so my understanding is that we have ,1
1688.94,when we think about fats by the way it's important to understand that structure a little bit so if we think about triglycerides it is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol so one two three and horizontally running off of each one of those are fatty acid chains right so we form this structure that looks like an e right like the letter e ,1
1706.64,three in the back and then three chains coming off of it each of those chains are called fatty acids and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon right or a number of carbons strung together however many carbons are there determines which type of fatty acid it is right so stearic acid linoleic acid like any different number of things it's ,1
1962.24,do different things we don't like to use protein as material or fuel it's better used as structure and what we have to do then is if all of a sudden we realize that storage is getting too much in our body in other words we're gaining too much weight we have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body and that is metabolism right anytime ,1
2495.82,Exchange so put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling more than you and inhaling without passing out the other problem is if you were to Simply do a breathing protocol while the rate of exhalation would go up after that you would correct and go in the opposite direction so that's the ,1
2515.44,problem is your net carbon the output over the course today is not going to change unless you increase the demand for energy and that's how you get into that negative state along these lines of exhaling carbons as the route for fat loss it makes me wonder whether or not increasing lung capacity is possible I'm ,1
2558.88,answer would be no not something you worry about because if you were to Exhale more carbon than actually needed now we're in a state of inefficiency you're burning way more energy than needed to do your activity the heart has a metric called cardiac output this is in Sciences we abbreviate this as Q ,1
2761.38,be determined by ventilation right how much air am I bringing in and putting out that's going to determine cardiac output and that's going to determine where we're at if you were to do like a sub maximal exercise test when you were unfit to when you're fit or when you're fit the way you're super fit at sub Max you're going to see the ,1
2779.079,same thing cardiac output will be identical and you're like damn nothing happened what you're not realizing is your heart rate at that same workload is now lower and that's efficiency because your stroke volume is higher where it gets people tripped up is at Max because you may not see much of a change ,1
3141.599,in other words once you stop the demand or the need for for energy you should stop ventilating but you don't right that's because in the case of low intensity exercise the second you stop you're right back down to resting ventilation no problem because you were able to match the need for energy with ,1
3160.8,the offload of waste one to one during that exercise when you start creeping up the intensity you can't do that so you have to basically start stealing a little bit of fuel here so even though you're done exercising you're still ventilating because you have to pay that back and pay that back by that I specifically mean you have to bring in ,1
3409.5,dangerous but not enough we'll we'll throw out these terms like fat adapted and fat adapted is a real thing but is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes right it is this idea thinking like I can get into a spot where I'm maximizing fat burning maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not ,1
3835.799,energy production comes from the local exercising muscle first and foremost from phosphocreatine and carbohydrate stores right and so again and we store it in a muscle we call it glycogen right that's it's your first sign of light on defense if you need glucose outside of that you're going to start pulling it from the blood but one ,1
3851.7,of the things your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything blood pH blood glucose blood pressure and electrolyte concentrations like it really does not want to mess with those things at all it will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standardized right you generally because you need all those things for ,1
4307.1,that alone all right so don't don't go nuts about that you have to be hypocaloric one way or the other if you burn a bunch of muscle glycogen and you are hyper caloric you're still going to add fat if you burn a muscle glycogen and you're hypochloric you're going to lose fat right think about it this way ,1
4328.76,you're in a negative calorie state where are those calories going to come from are you going to reduce your muscle glycogen storages permanently no no are you going to reduce your glycogen storage in your liver no you want to reduce blood glucose no no way right so where is that extra energy coming from it's coming from your ,1
4367.159,or systems right you're turning one and when we go through carbohydrate metabolism maybe here in a second you'll understand why you have to have an anaerobic and an aerobic component to that there is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen that has to happen the only way to engage in fat metabolism is aerobic ,1
4386.96,and oxygen there's no anaerobic component to it there's a fundamental difference there so the your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible it is the primary fuel source for a reason your fat is not meant to be flexible it is meant to be Unlimited that's the basic point so you want flexibility over here and an ,1
4923.12,energy producing systems will up regulator down regulate accordingly so you will actually limit your ability to say maximally utilized carbohydrate as a fuel if you're trying to up regulate your ability to use fat as a fuel and so this is like there's a saturation point outside of that Spectrum most people ,1
4937.699,just say hey like I want to feel great throughout the day to be able to do a bunch of different things how do you know a couple things there's a lot of biological markers you can take there's also just some some practical takes now none of these markers by themselves are any sign what you want ,1
5453.04,resistance training um in the last meal of the day but for me that's not really late at night that last meal is somewhere between 6 30 and 7 30 p.m so it's three or so hours or something like that before we go to sleep around 10 10 30 or so yeah so it's not you know midnight uh bowls of pasta I've done that too but um but typically ,1
5471.58,it's not so I think that um people will be very interested uh myself included in how meal timing relates to all of this but um yeah let's so how do you improve fat utilization how do you improve carbohydrate organization let's Hammer both out really quickly ,1
6243.179,we have a special name for that little molecule when you have pyruvate and you have a hydrogen attached to it you know what it's called uh hydrogen peroxide lactate lactate lactic acid this is that whole system right again I'm skipping some steps making a little bit of mistakes here intentionally folks just to make ,1
6263.159,this assumed so what happens when you start running a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis you start seeing massive rises in lactate cool not lactic acid right right that's why we see associations between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue but the lactate is actually not causing the ,1
6794.04,to be causing a lot of hurt and this is your managing waste right it is really an issue of managing what am I going to do with all this extra carbon what am I going to do with all this extra inorganic phosphate and some other nasty byproducts but that's the thing you have to deal with I'd love for you to teach me how ,1
6815.1,different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long I happen to be exercising for example if I do a very short bout of exercise yep typically that's correlated with a higher intensity output I mean I suppose I could jog for one minute but here I'm thinking about sprinting for one minute or less ,1
7352.28,muscle that's not working you can ship it to the liver you can ship it to the heart and a bunch of other places and then you can actually just work backwards so if you ship it to for example the heart and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free you can bring in the oxygen attach it to that hydrogen make water ,1
7369.44,and now you're right back to pyruvate you put two pyruvate back together and now you just make glucose so you can actually store it in the liver this is a process called gluconeogenesis through this fancy thing called the Corey cycle which is what the the proper cycle here is so you can use it as a very potent fuel ,1
8031.54,uptick of energy from fat as well as protein having said that it's not a tremendous fuel source it is only aerobic so it has to be oxidized those are the same thing when I say oxidized you use oxygen to burn something to make a fuel um so it's not a significant contributor to energy in that regard and unless ,1
8654.819,will never ever be your limiting factor to Performance so when we start talking about well what limits my performance in these areas you can just wipe fat off the list it will never be your limiting factor to any type of endurance performance you simply have way too much the only problem with ,1
8675.88,fat is is just too slow I've got to mobilize it I've got to get in the blood move it that whole thing too slow so if I want to go faster I will never be able to fully utilize fat which is why we talked about earlier you'll never see a situation in which somebody is a hundred percent burning fat as a fuel and no percent carbohydrate it's always going ,1
8928.6,addition to doing longer runs I tend to do all of those things across the week yeah but I've also observed and in fact know several people that love the very low carbohydrate AKA ketogenic type diet they're not doing ketogenic diets for mental health reasons per se but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot of ,1
8948.34,long endurance but low intensity long endurance these are the I walk to get my exercise types and they do indeed walk a lot and some of them manage to control their weight very readily and like that diet for that reason um when we had Lane Norton on the podcast he pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight you have to ,1
9014.28,the episode that we did on strength speed and hypertrophy so just to remind people the nine adaptations are number one skill and technique two speed three power which is speed times Force four strength and five hypertrophy today we're talking about the remaining adaptations on that list starting with muscular endurance ,1
9039.54,followed by anaerobic capacity followed by maximal aerobic output and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise so if we could start with muscular endurance this would be number six on the list of nine adaptations muscular endurance how do I build muscular endurance why ,1
9648.72,frequently so you won't get extremely sore from muscular endurance relative to traditional hypertrophy straining because the load is very very light so you can do these more frequently if you would like more frequently such as you could do it three or four times a week easy if you would like you don't necessarily need to ,1
9669.359,three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here um if you wanted to do more sets on a given day and do less days that would be fine so if you want to do two days a week and you say wanted to do let's say you could do 25 push-ups and the goal is to get to 30 push-ups just as an example you might say okay I'm gonna do sets of ,1
9817.02,um they do their longer run they're gonna do uh Max time a plank to Max duration they're going to do a wall set to Max duration and they're going to do push-ups to Max duration and then also do that same workout before they do their high intensity interval training some other point during the week and ,1
9837.18,then maybe even do it uh again um on their so-called rest day just a real quick five minutes of sure and in doing so build more capillaries into the relevant muscle groups and build their muscular endurance yep without eating into their overall recovery too much too much yeah so again the nice part about this is they don't Hammer you too much ,1
10047.6,glycolysis this is exactly why the community that I have worked a lot with professional fighters very high level boxers world champions UFC fighters it is a five minute round that you're going to do five times this is for world championship fights you get one minute break in between so imagine going like 30 on 30 off for five minutes ,1
10066.319,getting a one minute break and doing that five times even though the individual ballots are 30 seconds long the entire thing lasts so long it is primarily aerobic you have to have both capacities you got to get really high anaerobic you also have to have a lot of aerobic going on you have you're going to start running ,1
10519.26,talked about earlier the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or CO2 exhalation if you're restricting that this is going to be problematic so in your actual competition please go to the mouth if you need to right we practice a lot trying to stay nasal only for as long as possible but that's going to eventually happen when you're doing your ,1
10535.64,high intensity intervals and you're really going as hard as you can you're going to have to go to your mouth unless you're an absolute Freakazoid and you can say in your nose but that's not going to happen right most people can't get past say 70 or 80 percent while breathing through your nose um I know some people can get higher but ,1
10979.279,not a lot of eccentric load and yet one can go quote unquote all out for 30 to 60 seconds yep and and the consequences of a technical breakdown are minimal it's more like you're gonna actually have a worse performance rather than an injury rate so there's just a wonderful invention uh because of that where other things the consequences like say if ,1
10997.46,you're going to be doing a barbell or kettlebell activity the consequences of making a technical mistake you might actually get an acute injury right there so they're just a little bit higher in the risk scale how many sets or sometimes referred to as repeats so how many 30 to 60 second all out sprints again doesn't have to be ,1
11348.34,quality and the need for sufficient duration of this anaerobic work yeah how is five to six minutes per week of all out work that's pretty good so what that means for me is I would do three all out one minute sprints on one workout separated by a minute or ,1
11368.2,two maybe more and I would do that two or three times per week just trying to hit that five or six minute per week threshold yep actually I think uh one of the uh Marty gabala is the scientist a Canadian uh guy amazing work he was done a lot of ,1
12196.439,down and you'll go straight into a plank for a minute and you'll pick that up and you go straight into maybe body weight squats for two minutes then you go straight into another exercise and you can sort of rotate things around maybe you can do even some like Shadow Boxing stuff or some jump rope you can do different gymnastics movements and body ,1
12431.34,failure here so you need to practice that and this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills to just simply training in this fashion there's all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs and when we say that that's what we're really talking about the musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue so that's the only other ,1
12447.66,little component I wanted to throw in here if we're not talking about acid buffering which in this particular case is not a problem anymore the time domain is long and slower so we have plenty of time to use fat as a fuel we also have plenty of time to use anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis and ,1
13058.76,maintain your muscles for many people that are listening to this I'm guessing that they have an interest in building more endurance but not just the ability to go further but the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed and to do it with better form and to breathe better and to feel better before during and after ,1
13081.7,for those folks maybe you could spell out a program that combines these different elements of endurance and does so in a way that informs how for instance the higher intensity short duration Sprints would be expected to improve their longer duration work and how perhaps their longer duration work can progress if they are careful to ,1
13503.479,hit my pain points I'll understand what's happening and the adaptation that I'm triggering when my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air through my mouth or I can calmly move along just through nasal breathing I will now know what's happening in my body and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering I think you also highlight something that is ,1
