268.919,the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly so for instance when you go from a very brightly lit area to a dimlet area your visual system has to make all sorts of adjustments that allow you to still see your environment Roca ,1
285.54,eyeglasses and sunglasses were built with the biology of the visual system in mind so no matter what environment you're in you'll be able to see with perfect clarity and they have terrific Aesthetics an enormous number of choices in terms of Aesthetics so unlike a lot of so-called performance eyeglasses out there that only give you the option to ,1
507.479,is really about hormones and female hormones in particular and I have a question which is is it ever informative for a woman regardless of age to know something about her mother's perhaps even her grandmother's experience vis-a-vis ,1
1113.9,I don't recommend anyone Smoke by the way uh but it was uh coffee mate uh red meat and cigarettes and they lived into their 90s so that side of my family has the genetic Advantage the other side less so um but in any event uh Tango um is a 2023 goal it has been every year um the uh I'm gonna hold you accountable ,1
1422.24,ovarian menstrual cycle excuse me ovulatory menstrual cycle when would you suggest they do that if they had to pick one so if you forced me to pick one I would say probably day 21 to 22 for someone in her 20s so we're focused right now in that decade so for most women they've got a ,1
1442.7,menstrual cycle Dave that averages out at 28 days so this is about a week before they start their period for women or more irregular it's harder to do that as women get older and we'll talk about this in a moment usually the cycle gets a little shorter so as they start to decline in their progesterone production their period ,1
1880.58,going back 20 years so he can show you okay here's where I started having my smoothie and here's how my glucose and Insulin changed as a result of that I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all ,1
1898.58,of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's ,1
2135.4,what whether or not they have nutritional deficiencies what is the best way to analyze if one is getting enough magnesium and for that matter what is going to be the best way to test the microbiome you said stool sample and I'll come right back with the same question I asked about a blood test what time of day when during the month ,1
2193.48,been I'm not going to name companies but I've been tracking this over the years and it's never been clear to me that we know what constituents of the gut microbiome are are best we know that dysbiosis is bad yeah and we know that diversity of the microbiome is good we hear this yeah but no one's ever told me that you want a particular ratio of one ,1
2213.4,microbiota to another right in a way that has made any sense to me at least totally I'm not a microbiologist but whereas with you know with testosterone in men we hear okay you want your free testosterone to be about two percent of your total perhaps with women you women are gonna have more testosterone than estrogen on average but still less than ,1
2436.78,you have to measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood and with deficiency it's interesting with supplementation for my patients who tend toward constipation and that's frankly about 80 percent of the women that I take care of really yes ,1
2459.52,wow I'd be curious as to why that that is um is it I I can guess diet stress um patriarchy rage to psychosis so Pine the um the pine system right psychology Immunology neural and endocrine factors combined is that yes ,1
3068.16,that's right uh thank you for for that the um so what defines constipation I mean in other words let's think about the healthy rather than thinking about the unhealthy let's how many bowel movements should a woman or a man have per day assuming this is where it gets tricky because some people are doing time restricted feeding some people are ,1
3082.859,eating more some people eat more fiber more bulk larger meal at the end of the day a larger meal the beginning of the day we will never um be able to sort out all those variables but on average um how many bowel movements and his timing during the day for bowel movements at ,1
3501.059,what people do every day yeah and we were monitoring subjective mood Etc but also Biometrics remotely so it's kind of a nice Biometrics HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep cortisol uh I wish um so this was done during the pandemic more than 100 subjects the advantage was that we got data 24 hours a day because ,1
3806.76,um at risk of uh of just strengthening that uh statement I I mean that that to me is is signaling a bunch of other factors around us you said like keeping keeping things in um what do you think explains let's talk about that because I think that that's likely to have raised a certain flag in ,1
3860.22,and never waste a good flag well and let's preface it by by just saying that like people will have different opinions on this and that's and I think that's healthy and like with the discussion about constipation let's talk about what people aren't willing to talk about when it comes to health love it so we might need to talk about patriarchy on part ,1
3882.059,two but I'll give you some material that I've been working with I started I did not even understand the existence of patriarchy until I was a bioengineering undergraduate at MIT I should mention which has always had a bit of a of a male um askewed male in terms of Faculty numbers well my my that's true at most ,1
4313.28,range is healthy I know what the reference range is only because I know one could look it up I don't know it's off the top of my head immediately but what what's a kind of a nice reference point there so the way I tend to describe this on podcasts is the top half of the normal range great so that I think is a good benchmark ,1
4643.699,them ovulate more frequently that is the way that most conventional medicine approaches this and it does women at gigantic disservice so one of the things I'm speaking into is the gender gap that exists so I my feeling is that the research money that goes into women's health is abysmal compared to what goes into mental health really ,1
4661.88,and I think that's changing but there's also a huge lack of awareness of sex and gender differences when it comes to the way that we construct clinical trials and other experiments well that's absolutely true I mean I sit on I've sat on NIH review panels for more than a decade now I'm a regular standing member which is only to say ,1
5052.9,a receptor level I think I say insulin insensitive because when people hear insulin sensitive it almost sounds like a bad thing but that's actually what you want so I think I think that's how I defaulted to insulin what's your insulin I don't know what I'm due for a blood test yes you are I'm due for a blood test um I had blood work done for eight ,1
5068.98,months um sure that'd be great I uh I'm always um experimenting with different supplements and different behavioral regimens and I've kept charts since I was 19. oh you're like my patient I I've been sort of Obsessed by this and I would say everybody if you can afford it and at ,1
5318.28,this patriarchal relationship where doctors hold the power and are The Gatekeepers of data to patients and clients having much more access to that enchantment about their own chemistry and their own biology so to me that is so exciting like for me to be able to I've got you know probably 100 patients that are in a data stream with me where ,1
5788.139,my thyroid was mildly abnormal my progesterone was low and that set me on this course of realizing that what I was doing as a physician taking care especially of women was not getting to some of these root causes that are so essential and I would say I had to start first with cortisol at that time I was running four miles ,1
6261.179,fibromyalgia I was told that 1 in 12 people um have are heterozygous so one mutant copy or a hypomorphic for some some mutation in adrenal related genes so congenital adrenal hyperplasia is that true and if so that means that 1 in 12 people walking around are cranking out far too much cortisol or not enough ,1
6799.86,also have a food first philosophy so my preference would be that they're having salmon or some kind of Smash fish and they're getting that as the primary source of their Omega-3s and then the days that they don't have fish I recommend it probably twice a week that they take fish oil then I would put magnesium next since so many people are ,1
6818.219,deficient then I'd probably put vitamin D what how many IU of vitamin D per day well you keep asking me this like for the the population yeah well for the let me put it this way for the laze for the lazy person or and this is an or not an and or the person who ,1
6999.48,so if you look at for instance women who are nuns who don't take oral contraceptives and they have a period every single month of their reproductive lives they have a greater risk of a brain cancer so if you look then at women who have uh several babies and they've got a period of time when they're pregnant that ,1
7020.84,they're not ovulating and then they breastfeed for some period of time they have a lower risk of ovarian cancer so oral contraceptives help with reducing ovulation and reducing risk we know that if you take the oral contraceptive for about five years it reduces your risk of ovarian cancer by 50 and that's significant because ,1
7694.88,hitting their late 30s or early 40s and yeah they're having conceived or they suddenly decide that they want to conceive and I thought why doesn't every doctor insist that their female patients get have their amh level addressed so that if they need to freeze eggs cost it's cost yeah so I think if you've got the disposable income to do ,1
7717.56,it go for it it's not included in a standard blood panel no wow the only women in my practice who've had amhs done and have looked at their follicle count are women who want to freeze their eggs or and that requires disposable income or they um are having trouble getting pregnant so they are in the reproductive ,1
7885.619,initiated the hormone therapy hormone replacement therapy that it could be detrimental to their health so first of all do I recall that statement correctly and then second of all what sorts of hormones are being replaced is it just estrogen and how is that done is it done through birth control so oral contraceptives nuvarings ,1
7904.82,what are your thoughts on menopause when should people start thinking about it and what is the palette of things available so that we can do an entire episode with you on on this topic in the future but just to I you know I get a lot of questions about this and and I'm guessing based on everything you've told me today that ,1
8327.639,but then of course right I mean the brain is just incredibly metabolically demanding organ you deprive neurons of fuel sources they or you make them less sensitive to fuel sources they start dying they certainly start firing less it makes perfect sense and I think now it's thanks to Lisa's work work that ,1
8348.88,you've you've done and talked about quite a lot is um in your books and elsewhere I think has really you know highlighted for people that metabolism and metabolomics is going to be as important as genes and genomics when it comes that's right dementia perhaps especially in women is it safe to say that I think I think so because ,1
8696.52,um he's a PhD deep phenotyping bioinformatics guy who wanted to make this really easy so the test is is Under the Umbrella of thorn and um they just call it got bio they might have another name for it and they just improved it so that it's just a wipe ,1
8957.1,taken so it's a CT scan of the chest you can self-order it like I think at Stanford Hospital you can self-order it last time a patient checked it was 250 so again disposable income but it it tells you it it almost gives you this fork in the road in terms of how much you need to pay attention to cardiometabolic health as a woman and ,1
