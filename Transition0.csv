855.06,is very different than the type of pain that arises from muscular tension as is the case with Tension Headache okay so now we have two sources of pain that is the ache in headache and there are two more that we need to think about in trying to better understand the different types of headaches that we'll discuss and in terms of trying to ,1
872.399,understand which are going to be the best treatments for the different types of headaches and those are neural and inflammatory responses so let's talk about the neural type first there is a type of headache that many people unfortunately suffer from we'll get into this in a bunch more detail in a moment but those are called cluster headaches ,1
1081.26,inflammatory cytokines but there are also non-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines but inflammatory molecules that are signaling to the rest of the body hey there's something going on here there's either some intrusive object and indeed if you were to get you know a bb or a splinter into a particular uh you know ,1
1100.039,skin area there'd be a lot of inflammation so it could be the introduction of a foreign physical object into an area that will cause inflammation it can be the presence of some sort of local toxin in that area it could be a more systemic inflammation nonetheless inflammation in the neck and head area where frankly anywhere within ,1
1342.32,exist in combination however this isn't important however all pain or I should say all experience of pain as a perception is going to be neural in origin when we experience pain whether or not it's a pin prick or a cut stub our toe we trip and fall or a headache it is neural in ,1
1995.179,pattern but can really extend to other tissues as well not so often in the face but really the head and often will start to climb up toward the top of the head they are not always in this Halo pattern sometimes they can be localized to one area such as the you know the back of the head or the front of the head or one side of the head more than others and ,1
2512.859,I'm going to pop a couple of aspirin okay what does aspirin do aspirin's and anti-inflammatory it also has pronounced effects on the vasodilation and vasoconstriction system it actually allows more blood to flow through those arteries vessels and capillaries a lot of people actually use baby aspirin or small amounts of aspirin as a way to ,1
2530.5,offset cardiovascular disease that's another discussion but what do we know we know that in migraine there's a hyper dilation of the blood vessels a hyper dilation of the very little portals that exist in the brain and around the brain and that are going to cause the pain you're going to activate those Sensory neurons those non-iceceptors that will ,1
2815.319,other symptom that's quite common in cluster type headache is a droopy eyelid which should make sense because the trigeminal innervates the eye region and there are other nerves that control the eyelid but they're in that General region and they can be impacted the other thing is something called meiosis which is that you can't dilate the pupil ,1
2831.76,I mentioned this before so those your pupils might get really really small and they won't dilate and the other thing is lacrimation tearing and then nasal discharge all because of a neural inflammation problem why do I tell you with such detail about cluster headaches well if you are somebody that's experiencing the kind of pain that is ,1
2867.94,you have to deal with this as a neural issue and we'll talk about some of the main causes of inflammation and activation of these cluster type headaches at the level of the trigeminal nerve in a little bit because fortunately there are some excellent treatments the next type of headache that is quite common are hormonal ,1
2883.06,headaches now the phrase hormonal headache should already cue you to the fact that it's far too General a term because there's so many different hormones testosterone estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone and on and on and on and they all have many different functions in the brain and body every ,1
3569.099,regular sufficient amounts of deep sleep each night are going to be important for all aspects of mental health physical health and performance and have been shown over and over again to reduce the frequency of headache and to reduce the time to repair after traumatic brain injury and can improve cognition and on and on and ,1
3586.68,on so sleep is essential for all the normal things that encourage healthy activity of the different tissues that are involved in brain and body to occur so sleep deprivation of course is going to limit those but I do want to point out that sleep sunlight and I've talked about this almost ad nauseam on this podcast but ,1
4090.68,people take a dose of 0.4 grams of creatine monohydrate per kilogram of body weight so for somebody that weighs 100 kilograms or 220 pounds that would be 40 grams of creatine per day if someone weighs half that much they would take 20 grams of creatine per day and they did that over a period of six months and we know that when you take ,1
4575.78,in a few minutes now with respect to omega-6 fatty acids the most typical food sources of omega-6 fatty acids are seed oils I know nowadays seed oils have become quite controversial I've given my stance on this in a prior podcast but I'll just repeat it for those of you that haven't heard it I am ,1
4779.48,parts of cells in the brain and body that's right the membrane that remember I talked before about how steroid hormones can go through the different membranes of the cells the outer membrane and the inner membrane a lot of those actual membranes the structural constituents of neurons and other cells are actually made up of or include ,1
4796.64,certain fatty acid long-chain fatty acids and the omega-3 fatty acids are important for or the actual construction of those tissues as well as having anti-inflammatory effects through things like limiting prostaglandins and other things that can cause inflammation okay so there are a bunch of different ways that omega-3 fatty acids can be useful ,1
4840.32,low six and as compared to diets that were just reduced omega-6s they found a greater analgesic effect of increasing Omega-3s while also reducing omega-6 fatty acids so in the context of the seed oil discussion although keeping in mind that omega-6s can come from other sources as well if omega-6s were just reduced on their own there wasn't as ,1
4861.56,great in effect in terms of reducing pain and inflammation as there was when omega-3 fatty acids were deliberately increased and omega-6 fatty acids were reduced again in all of these studies because these are the ones in which they controlled things well as we should as we say they are holding constant the caloric intake so it's not just that ,1
5270.46,still an effect of some treatment or for instance they will swap in and out different studies and different combinations to see whether or not any one study is really leading to the conclusion that a given treatment does something in any case in the meta-analysis of omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of headache and that ,1
5287.08,includes all the different kinds of headache they found in exploring a huge range of Omega-3 supplementation ranging from 200 milligrams all the way up to 2 000 milligrams per day it really was at the one gram or higher dosage per day where the significant impact on reducing ,1
5811.06,sunlight sunlight includes a huge range of wavelengths including long wavelength light of course you've seen that as the Reds and oranges in the sunset and so on those intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the eye respond best to bright green or blue light and they send connections to a bunch of different places in the brain ,1
6637.56,probably be some effects I mean admittedly we've talked before on this podcast about things like apogenin epigenin is one of the core components of chamomile and chamomile is known to make people feel a little bit sleepy and can enhance sleep well apogenic and high concentration can indeed augment sleep ,1
6653.28,we talk about this in our sleep tool kit by the way we don't just have episodes about sleep master or sleep perfect your sleep Etc but if you go to the hubermanlab.com website and you go to the menu and you click on newsletter you can scroll down you'll see that we have a tool kit for sleep this is completely zero cost to access you don't even have ,1
6800.94,understand the neurophysiology and not just get subjective ratings of headache although they did that too but they really want to understand how these oils can impact things like muscular tension or perception of pain what they did is they recreated headache in human subjects by using tightening cuffs of the of the head they cut off ,1
7380.78,very briefly there's a laboratory at Harvard Medical School run by chufuma chufu is well known in the Neuroscience Community for doing excellent work in parsing the mechanisms of touch sensation and pain in particular so not just touch at the level of skin but pain and pain Pathways and in recent years his laboratory has started to do studies ,1
7484.94,impacting the activity of all sorts of different organs including organs that give rise to some of the inflammatory cytokines so basically what I'm saying here is that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture and the maps of different insertion sites we now know or I should say people have long known and people in the west are starting to adopt ,1
7964.4,adenosine in your system as I mentioned before but also there seems to be a kind of bimodal distribution whereby some people when they drink caffeine it really improves their headache and so in some cases a very significant effects whereas other people when they drink caffeine it really exacerbates their headache and as at least as far as I ,1
7981.199,could tell from the literature it's not easy to predict who those people are going to be what is reassuring however is it does not seem to be the case that if you're somebody who experiences relief from headaches by drinking caffeine that suddenly one day to the next you're going to experience a worsening of your headache ,1
8488.439,remember that heat and spicy go together in these neural Pathways and a bunch of different heat related and spice related Pathways get activated simultaneously when one ingests something of extreme spice and the blood vessels and indeed some of the smaller arteries feeding neural tissue shut down and he experienced this Thunderclap headache ,1
