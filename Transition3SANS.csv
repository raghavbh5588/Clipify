today's podcast cast our first sponsor is Roka Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality I spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly so for instance when you ,1
go from a very brightly lit area to a dimlet area your visual system has to make all sorts of adjustments that allow you to still see your environment Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were built with the biology of the visual system in mind so no matter what environment you're in you'll be able to see with perfect clarity and they have terrific ,1
going to be to constrain this walk as it were but I'm hoping that we can touch on a great number of things today the first of which is really about hormones and female hormones in particular and I have a question which is is it ever informative for a woman ,1
regardless of age to know something about her mother's perhaps even her grandmother's experience vis-a-vis hormones not just pregnancy challenges with or um ease with pregnancy and child rearing childbirth this sort of thing but you know what sorts of conversations should ,1
remained mentally sharp until he died in his late 90s but um almost burned down their apartment several times falling asleep with a cigarette in his mouth so I don't recommend anyone Smoke by the way uh but it was uh coffee mate uh red meat and cigarettes and they lived into their 90s so that side of my family has the genetic Advantage the other side ,1
less so um but in any event uh Tango um is a 2023 goal it has been every year um the uh I'm gonna hold you accountable today okay we'll do and there no there will be no YouTube video of me do at least not initially Tim Ferriss actually a phenomenal podcaster as we know is uh he's a badass he's a badass Tango Tango ,1
their menstrual cycle if they had to pick one you know either in the follicular phase and or in the luteal stage of their ovarian menstrual cycle excuse me ovulatory menstrual cycle when would you suggest they do that if they had to pick one so if you forced me to pick one I would say ,1
probably day 21 to 22 for someone in her 20s so we're focused right now in that decade so for most women they've got a menstrual cycle Dave that averages out at 28 days so this is about a week before they start their period for women or more irregular it's harder to do that as women get older and we'll ,1
take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the ,1
better for prebiotics and um a selective use of polyphenols how would a person in their teens and 20s or any age for that matter know what whether or not they have nutritional deficiencies what is the best way to analyze if one is getting enough magnesium and for that matter what is going to be the best way to test ,1
the microbiome you said stool sample and I'll come right back with the same question I asked about a blood test what time of day when during the month um to establish a baseline so this would be prior to embarking on a you know 97 vegetables or how many years per day 57. well I love the idea that you're telling us if I'm gathering correctly is that ,1
dysbiosis is bad yeah and we know that diversity of the microbiome is good we hear this yeah but no one's ever told me that you want a particular ratio of one microbiota to another right in a way that has made any sense to me at least totally I'm not a microbiologist but whereas with you know with testosterone in men we hear okay you want your free ,1
kind of Precision cardiometabolic Health he thinks spectrosol is the best test out there so you asked about magnesium you have to measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood and with deficiency it's interesting with supplementation ,1
for my patients who tend toward constipation and that's frankly about 80 percent of the women that I take care of really yes wow I'd be curious as to why that that is um is it I I can guess diet stress um patriarchy rage ,1
movements should a woman or a man have per day assuming this is where it gets tricky because some people are doing time restricted feeding some people are eating more some people eat more fiber more bulk larger meal at the end of the day a larger meal the beginning of the day we will never um be able to sort out all those ,1
variables but on average um how many bowel movements and his timing during the day for bowel movements at all informative what works for you um well when I'm asleep um generally I don't want a bowel movement so I'm going to be like most people right well sleep is primary for ,1
briefly that study was we we wanted to find a minimal effective dose intervention yeah I just wanted yeah so five minutes a day we need to figure out what people do every day yeah and we were monitoring subjective mood Etc but also Biometrics remotely so it's kind of a nice Biometrics HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep ,1
cortisol uh I wish um so this was done during the pandemic more than 100 subjects the advantage was that we got data 24 hours a day because they're pinging us in their data uh wearing HRV 24 yeah nice so that was nice resting heart rate um subjective mood we would get in touch with them daily so when people were ,1
um yeah let's talk about that you know you mentioned earlier that all these stress factors you you said patriarchy right yeah but I think what if I may um at risk of uh of just strengthening that uh statement I I mean that that to me is is signaling a bunch of other factors around us you said like keeping keeping things in ,1
um what do you think explains let's talk about that because I think that that's likely to have raised a certain flag in people's minds like what exactly is she talking about are you talking about less opportunity are you talking about less opportunity to um to vocalize are you talking about ,1
structures and Dynamics are impacting I'd love let's hear your thoughts on that because uh I I hate to let a flag like that go by without fleshing it out and never waste a good flag well and let's preface it by by just saying that like people will have different opinions on this and that's and I think that's healthy and like with the discussion ,1
about constipation let's talk about what people aren't willing to talk about when it comes to health love it so we might need to talk about patriarchy on part two but I'll give you some material that I've been working with I started I did not even understand the existence of patriarchy until I was a bioengineering undergraduate at MIT I ,1
declines by about one percent per year what level of testosterone do you like to see in a woman once she's sort of post let's say after age 25 what kind of range is healthy I know what the reference range is only because I know one could look it up I don't know it's off the top of my head immediately but what what's a kind of a nice reference ,1
point there so the way I tend to describe this on podcasts is the top half of the normal range great so that I think is a good benchmark you know for PCOS generally it's much higher than that you know I've seen patients with PCOS where their total testosterone is 100 to 200. do they always have peripheral ,1
gender gap that exists so I my feeling is that the research money that goes into women's health is abysmal compared to what goes into mental health really and I think that's changing but there's also a huge lack of awareness of sex and gender differences when it comes to the way that we construct clinical trials and other experiments ,1
that offers people a way in and I love to do that in terms of messaging insulin resistance starts to lose people because they don't really get what that means at a receptor level I think I say insulin insensitive because when people hear insulin sensitive it almost sounds like a bad thing but that's actually what you want so I think I think that's how I ,1
defaulted to insulin what's your insulin I don't know what I'm due for a blood test yes you are I'm due for a blood test um I had blood work done for eight months um sure that'd be great I uh I'm always um experimenting with different supplements and different behavioral regimens and I've kept charts since I ,1
and their own biology so to me that is so exciting like for me to be able to I've got you know probably 100 patients that are in a data stream with me where we're looking at their glucose and I can I mean I'm on sabbatical so I'm not doing this so much anymore but I can call a patient be like why is your glucose so high like what did you do oh ,1
a hormone panel and my cortisol was three times what it should have been my insulin was in the 20s I was fasting my glucose was 105. my thyroid was mildly abnormal my progesterone was low and that set me on this course of realizing that what I was doing as a physician taking care especially of women was not getting ,1
to some of these root causes that are so essential and I would say I had to start first with cortisol at that time I was running four miles three times a week four times a week that was just racing my cortisol further so that was not the right exercise for me I needed more adaptive exercise I started doing Pilates more yoga that ,1
congenital adrenal hyperplasia is that true and if so that means that 1 in 12 people walking around are cranking out far too much cortisol or not enough cortisol or the cortisol system is already skewed in a direction that makes life more challenging at the levels we're talking about um did I hear that correctly because ,1
days that they don't have fish I recommend it probably twice a week that they take fish oil then I would put magnesium next since so many people are deficient then I'd probably put vitamin D what how many IU of vitamin D per day well you keep asking me this like for the the population yeah well for the let ,1
greater risk of a brain cancer so if you look then at women who have uh several babies and they've got a period of time when they're pregnant that they're not ovulating and then they breastfeed for some period of time they have a lower risk of ovarian cancer so oral contraceptives help with reducing ovulation and reducing risk we know that ,1
get have their amh level addressed so that if they need to freeze eggs cost it's cost yeah so I think if you've got the disposable income to do it go for it it's not included in a standard blood panel no wow the only women in my practice who've had amhs done and have looked at their follicle count are women who ,1
all what sorts of hormones are being replaced is it just estrogen and how is that done is it done through birth control so oral contraceptives nuvarings what are your thoughts on menopause when should people start thinking about it and what is the palette of things available so that we can do an entire episode with you on on ,1
sensitive to fuel sources they start dying they certainly start firing less it makes perfect sense and I think now it's thanks to Lisa's work work that you've you've done and talked about quite a lot is um in your books and elsewhere I think has really you know highlighted for people that metabolism and metabolomics is going to ,1
AI it was designed by um a guy who's got inflammatory bowel disease and he is a um he's a PhD deep phenotyping bioinformatics guy who wanted to make this really easy so the test is is Under the Umbrella of thorn ,1
and um they just call it got bio they might have another name for it and they just improved it so that it's just a wipe instead of digging through her stool and so my athletes will do it now they were not so into digging through their stool before is anybody really no one is I don't want the answer ,1
today it would be to do a coronary artery calcium score by age 45 and sooner if you've got premature heart disease how is that taken so it's a CT scan of the chest you can self-order it like I think at Stanford Hospital you can self-order it last time a patient checked it was 250 so again disposable income but it it ,1
tells you it it almost gives you this fork in the road in terms of how much you need to pay attention to cardiometabolic health as a woman and it's uh 45 for men too so if you haven't had one if you had one no you need one insulin cortisol CAC great so I'll run all that by you it's really essential and it's um ,1
