0.35,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
1.92,where we discuss science and science based tools 
4.92,for everyday life. 
6.318,[mellow music] 
9.15,I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology 
11.68,and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.122,Today we're talking all about habits. 
16.425,"In particular, "
17.381,we're going to discuss the biology of habit formation 
20.902,and the biology of how we break habits. 
24.16,I think we can all appreciate the value of having habits. 
27.931,Habits organize our behavior 
29.92,into more or less reflexive actions 
31.88,so we don't have to think too much 
33.54,"about performing the various behaviors that, for instance, "
37.16,allow us to brush our teeth 
38.419,or which side of bed we roll out of in the morning. 
41.459,"And then of course, habits can be more elaborate too. "
44.5,We can be in the habit of exercising 
46.1,at a particular time of day. 
47.55,We can be in the habit of eating certain foods. 
49.23,We can be in the habit of saying or saying certain things. 
52.032,"But of course, "
53.054,"there are many habits that don't serve us well, "
55.92,or that perhaps even undermine our immediate 
58.5,and long term health goals and psychological goals. 
61.479,And even some habits 
62.373,that can really undermine our overall life goals. 
65.5,"So today we're going to talk about making, meaning forming, "
68.62,"and breaking, meaning stopping, various habits. "
71.061,There's a lot of information out there about habits. 
74.76,You'll find this in the popular sphere. 
76.27,"There are books, there are articles, there are workshops, "
78.57,and so forth. 
79.84,"However, lesser known is that there's a whole neuroscience "
82.85,of habit formation and habit breaking. 
84.84,And there's a whole field of psychology devoted 
86.94,to understanding habit formation and habit breaking. 
90.17,"And within those scientific literatures, "
92.41,"I think there are some real gems that, "
94.36,"at least to my knowledge, "
95.43,we haven't paid too much attention to 
97.03,in the popular sphere. 
98.55,"So today, "
99.383,we're going to talk about the biology of habit formation 
101.2,and habit breaking. 
107.88,I'm going to boil these down to some very explicit steps 
111.25,that anyone can use. 
113.3,"My reasoning for doing that is, first of all, "
115.58,it's the end of 
2021.,
117.65,Many people are thinking about new year's resolutions. 
119.69,They're thinking about leaving some things behind from 
2021,
123.95,and previous. 
125.17,"And acquiring some new behaviors, "
127.274,"taking on some new challenges, "
128.93,and trying to bring new things to their lives. 
130.71,"But regardless of when you're listening to this, "
132.494,the programs that I'll outline 
134.79,are grounded in the neuroscience 
136.25,and biology of habit formation. 
138.15,And they map very well 
139.31,"to what the psychologists have described, "
141.1,in terms of habit formation and breaking. 
143.12,"So today you're going to learn a lot of science, "
144.57,you're also going to come away with some practical tools 
146.326,and I'm certain that regardless of your present state 
148.81,"or goals, there'll be something of value to you. "
151.5,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize "
153.09,that this podcast is separate from my teaching 
154.85,and research roles at Stanford. 
156.56,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
158.38,to bring zero cost to consumer information 
160.21,about science and science related tools 
162.11,to the general public. 
163.39,"In keeping with that theme, "
164.28,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
166.423,Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. 
168.712,"Athletic greens is in all-in-one vitamin, "
170.92,"mineral, probiotic drink. "
172.67,I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 
"2012,",
175.17,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
177.67,The reason I started taking Athletic Greens 
179.23,and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is 
181.52,"that because of the ingredients it contains, "
183.58,I know that I'm covering all of my foundation needs 
185.84,"for vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. "
188.23,There is a wealth of knowledge now pointing to the fact 
190.92,that the so-called gut-brain axis is important 
193.167,"for our brain health, for our metabolic health, "
196.28,"for our hormone health, for our immune system, "
198.52,"so the probiotics, vitamins, "
199.83,and minerals really support that system. 
201.75,And many of the other things it contains 
204.02,"generally support our health, "
205.77,"in terms of neural system, meaning the brain, "
207.96,"the spinal cord, et cetera. "
209.221,"Basically, Athletic Greens has all the things I need, "
212.13,"nothing I don't, and by taking it once or twice a day, "
215.29,I always feel better 
216.25,and I know that I'm covering all my bases. 
218.594,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "

241.39,Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
244.11,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
247.09,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
249.216,to help you better understand your body 
251.25,and help you reach your health goals. 
252.9,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood-work done 
255.628,for the simple reason that most of the factors 
258.68,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
260.74,can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. 
263.15,"And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests, "
265.55,you can also get insight into your particular needs 
268.3,for your genetic type. 
270.566,"Now, a major issue with a lot of blood tests "
273.29,"and DNA tests out there is you get the numbers back, "
275.38,"you get a lot of information back, "
276.56,but you don't know what to do with that information. 
278.226,InsideTracker makes that very easy. 
280.37,They have a personalized platform 
282.087,where you get your numbers 
283.88,"and it points to specific things that you can do, "
285.77,"in terms of behavioral protocols, "
287.35,"meaning things you perhaps should do more of or less of, "
289.764,"nutritional protocols, "
291.67,"things that you perhaps should ingest more of or less of, "
294.126,and various things that you might consider 
296.41,"for more elaborate, directed approaches "
298.65,to adjusting the numbers in your blood and DNA profiles. 
301.695,"Another feature of InsideTracker, "
302.723,"is that it has what's called ""The Inner Age Test"". "
305.52,This test allows you to see what your biological age is 
307.8,and compare that to your chronological age. 
309.83,"Of course, "
310.663,your biological age is the one that you can control 
312.82,and that's the one that's really important 
314.29,to your immediate and long-term health. 
316.16,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "
317.56,you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman 
320.46,to get 
25%,off any of InsideTracker's plans. 
323.53,That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 
25%,off. 
327.62,Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. 
330.13,Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows 
332.7,that I truly believe are the best out there. 
335.696,I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress 
337.95,for about a year now 
339.07,and it's the best sleep I've ever had. 
340.476,One thing that makes Helix mattresses really unique 
343.193,is that they are tailored to your unique sleep needs. 
346.49,"You can go to their website, you take a quiz, "
348.24,"it only takes about two minutes, "
349.72,and it will match your body type and sleep preferences 
352.67,to a particular mattress. 
354.09,"So, it will ask you questions such as, "
355.167,"""Do you sleep on your side, you back, or your stomach?"" "
357.987,"""Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?"" "
359.7,Maybe you don't know. 
360.718,You answer those questions and it matches you 
362.95,to the mattress that's right for you. 
364.64,"For me, that turned out to be the Dusk Mattress, D U S K. "
367.61,"I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm, not too soft. "
369.98,"Anyway, I matched to the Dusk. "
371.55,"I've been sleeping on a Dusk Mattress, "
372.98,as I mentioned before. 
374.45,It's been the best experience for me. 
376.05,My sleep is so improved. 
377.563,So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress 
379.61,"go to helixsleep.com/huberman, "
381.88,"take their two-minute sleep quiz, "
383.16,and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you. 
385.47,And you'll get up to $
200,off all mattress orders 
388.33,and two free pillows. 
389.74,"Again, go to helixsleep.com/huberman, "
392.28,"take their quiz, match to the mattress that's right for you, "
394.613,"and if you decide to purchase it, "
396.15,you'll get up to $
200,off all mattress orders 
398.97,and two free pillows. 
400.19,They have a ten-year warrantee 
401.62,"and if you want to try it out, you can do that "
403.66,for 
100,nights risk-free. 
405.08,They'll even pick the mattress up for you 
406.34,"if you don't love it, "
407.173,but I'm pretty confident that you will. 
409.24,"Again, helixsleep.com/huberman "
411.728,is where you'll find the Helix mattress for you. 
414.14,Let's talk about habits. 
415.82,"And anytime we're talking about habits, "
417.65,that means our nervous system learns something. 
420.653,"Now, many people think that habits are just like reflexes, "
424.196,but pure reflexes are things like the eye blink reflex. 
428.27,"You know, something comes towards your eye "
429.65,"and you don't want it to get in your eye, you'll blink. "
431.787,"Or if you happen to step on a sharp object, "
434.607,"or get too close to something that's too hot, "
437.17,you'll reflexively move away. 
438.91,Those aren't habits. 
439.85,Those are what we call hard-wired reflexes. 
442.442,"Habits are things that our nervous system learned, "
445.995,but not always consciously. 
447.94,Sometimes we develop habits that we're not even aware of 
450.178,until they become a problem 
452.39,or maybe they serve us well. 
454.09,Who knows? 
455.0,But the fact of the matter is 
456.019,that habits are a big part of who we are. 
458.359,What we do habitually makes up much of what we do entirely. 
463.43,"In fact, it's estimated "
464.263,that up to 
70%,of our waking behavior is made up 
467.796,of habitual behavior. 
470.023,"So, you can imagine that there's a lot of biology, "
473.308,"meaning cells and hormones and neural pathways, et cetera, "
476.52,that are going to support development of those habits. 
479.74,"So if habits are largely, learned, "
481.43,"consciously or unconsciously, "
483.532,"we have to ask ourselves, "
485.23,what is learning? 
486.26,"Well, learning is neuroplasticity. "
488.91,Neuroplasticity is simply the process 
491.41,by which our nervous system changes 
493.28,in response to experience. 
494.861,"We have to ask, what changes? "
496.97,"Well, what changes are the connections between neurons. "
499.87,Neurons are just nerve cells. 
501.26,They communicate with one another by electricity 
503.7,and by sending chemical signals to one another 
506.1,that inspire the next neuron and the next neuron 
508.65,to either electrically active or not. 
510.797,"But at the end of the day, "
512.26,"neuroplasticity is about forming new neural circuits, "
515.46,"new pathways by which certain habits are likely to occur, "
518.66,and other ones are less likely to occur. 
520.572,"So, we've got habits. "
521.862,"We have that habits are learned, "
524.11,"we have that learning involves neuroplasticity, "
526.66,and that neuroplasticity involves changes 
528.65,"in the connections between neurons, nerve cells. "
531.17,"Okay, so that describes habits through the lens "
533.81,"of neuroscience and biology, "
535.94,"but as many of you are well aware, "
537.737,there are popular books about habits 
539.807,"and there's a whole psychological literature about habits, "
542.208,and those two areas point 
545.61,to some very interesting aspects of habits 
547.55,that I think are worth mentioning. 
549.15,First of all is this notion of immediate goal-based habits 
553.62,versus identity-based habits. 
555.927,Immediate goal-based habits are going to be habits 
558.72,that are designed to bring you a specific outcome 
561.223,"as you do them, "
562.85,so each and every time you do them. 
564.6,"So for instance, "
565.433,"it might be that you want to develop a habit of getting, "
568.047,"you know, "
60,"minutes of zone II cardio each day, "
572.326,or perhaps 
3-,
4,"times per week, as we head into the new year. "
576.91,I've talked before on the podcast about the fact 
579.24,that the scientific literature 
580.307,and the health literature really points 
581.88,to the incredibly positive effects 
584.22,of getting 
150,minutes to 
180,minutes per week minimum 
588.096,of what's called zone II cardio. 
590.29,Zone II cardio is basically any cardiovascular exercise 
593.476,"that gets you moving, and your heart pumping, "
596.23,"and breathing, "
597.582,"but not so hard that you can't hold a conversation, "
599.21,and so that kind of puts you at the threshold 
602.072,of just being just able to have a conversation 
602.905,"that's a little bit strained, "
603.99,"but if you were to exercise a little bit harder, "
605.99,"you know, run a little bit faster, et cetera, "
608.13,you wouldn't be able to talk while you did it. 
609.987,There's a lot of literature that points to that 
612.19,as a healthy practice. 
613.7,So maybe you're somebody that wants 
615.24,"to get more of zone II cardio, for instance. "
618.047,That would be an immediate goal-based habit 
621.476,"if your goal is to get that cardio, "
625.13,maybe 
4,times a week. 
627.29,Every time you do it you check off a little box 
629.25,"and you say, ""Okay, I did it."" You met the goal. "
632.54,That is different than so-called identity-based habits 
636.1,"where there's a larger, over-arching theme to the habit, "
639.58,"where you're trying to become, quote unquote, "
641.777,"""a fit person"". "
642.8,Or you're somebody who wants to be an athlete 
646.19,or something of that sort. 
647.18,It's where you start to attach some sort of larger picture 
649.78,about yourself or what it means for you to do that habit 
653.33,"where there's both the immediate goal, right? "
656.32,"Complete the exercise, complete the session, "
658.99,"or whatever it is, check off that box. "
661.258,But that you're linking it to some sort of larger goal. 
663.91,"Now, why am I making this distinction? "
665.38,"I mean, first of all, "
666.32,I'm not the one to first make this distinction. 
668.2,Others have made the distinction between identity 
670.067,versus immediate goal-based habit formation. 
672.541,But the reason I'm making the distinction is 
674.35,that pretty soon in our discussion today 
676.007,"we are going to talk about dopamine, "
678.47,"a molecule that's associated with motivation and reward, "
682.27,"that we make in our brain, "
684.029,and how different schedules of dopamine release 
687.764,predict where we will stick to a habit or not. 
691.513,"And in particular, "
692.61,whether or not we will be able to form that habit quickly 
695.082,or not. 
695.915,"Now, this is absolutely critical to understand "
699.34,for the following reason. 
700.81,Another thing that you'll hear out there in the literature 
702.96,is that it takes 
21,days to form a habit. 
705.28,Some people say 
"18,",some people say 
"21,",
707.64,some people say 
30,"days, some people say "
60,days. 
710.094,So which one is it? 
711.31,Does it depend on the habit that one is trying to form? 
713.51,Or does it depend on the person 
714.67,that's trying to form the habit? 
716.4,"Well, it turns out "
717.233,that there's excellent peer-reviewed data on this. 
719.63,There's a study published in 
"2010,",
721.02,"first author Lally, L A L L Y. "
723.436,"This study found that, "
724.87,"for the same habit to be formed, "
727.441,it can take anywhere from 
18,days 
730.74,to as many as 
254,days for different individuals 
734.62,to form that habit. 
735.62,"The reason I bring this up, is that I always get asked, "
738.307,"""Is it true that it takes "
21,"days to form a habit?"" "
740.947,"""Is it true that your nervous system changes in six days"" "
743.527,"""when you're doing something repeatedly?"" "
745.64,"And the answer is, as I mentioned before, "
748.01,it's highly variable. 
749.46,"What I didn't tell you actually, "
750.73,is what specific habit they were looking at 
752.47,in that Lally study. 
754.04,And it's interesting that the specific behavior 
756.55,was a health-related behavior. 
758.7,"That's pretty relevant to our discussion here, "
760.36,on the podcast. 
761.34,Which was taking walks after dinner. 
763.78,There's actually a really nice literature 
766.0,showing that walks after a meal 
768.37,"can speed glucose clearance from the blood stream, "
771.31,"can be beneficial for not just weight loss, "
773.41,"but cardiovascular health, et cetera. "
775.64,"So a walk after dinner seems pretty straight-forward, right? "
778.26,"Well, in order to form that habit, "
780.141,it took some people 
18,days and other people 
254,days. 
785.1,How did they know when they formed the habit? 
786.44,"Well, they were doing it about "
85%,of the time 
789.415,and they also reported not having to spend 
792.41,that much mental effort in order to get into to the mode 
796.43,of taking a walk after dinner. 
797.95,"So, for those of you listening, "
799.03,"some of you might be thinking, "
799.937,"""I can't believe that it would take certain people "
254,"days"" "
802.667,"""to get into that habit."" "
804.21,"As I said, people are highly variable "
806.266,"and if you can't form one habit easily, "
809.13,it doesn't mean that you can't form other habits easily. 
811.538,The mystery of why certain people 
814.67,can form certain habits more easily than others? 
817.36,Probably has something to do with how people manage 
820.73,what's called limbic friction. 
822.39,"Now, limbic friction is not a term that you're going to find "
824.972,in the formal neurobiological literature 
827.72,or even some of the psychological literature. 
829.49,"It's, frankly, a term that I coined "
831.486,to encompass a number of different pieces 
834.9,of the psychology and neuroscience literature. 
837.48,Limbic friction is a short-hand way 
839.73,that I use to describe the strain that's required 
843.12,in order to overcome one of two states within your body. 
847.0,"One state is one of anxiousness, "
848.91,where you're really anxious 
849.93,"and therefore you can't calm down, you can't relax, "
853.51,and therefore you can't engage in some particular activity 
856.0,or thought pattern that you would like. 
857.83,The other state is one in which you're feeling too tired 
860.21,or lazy or not motivated. 
862.67,"Both of those states, feeling too alert "
865.14,"and too calm, if you will, "
866.8,relate to the function 
867.66,"of the so-called autonomic nervous system, "
869.69,a set of neurons and hormones and chemicals in your brain 
872.75,and body that act as sort of a see-saw. 
874.69,You're either alert or calm. 
876.17,You're either asleep or stressed. 
878.25,Those two states are not compatible with one another. 
881.3,"You've probably heard of ""wired and tired"" "
882.99,but that's really once you've been very stressed 
885.04,"for a long time, to the point where you're exhausted. "
887.55,What does the autonomic nervous system have to do 
889.22,with any of this? 
890.053,"Well, limbic friction is a phrase "
893.095,"that can be used to describe how much effort, "
895.84,how much activation energy you need 
898.51,in order to engage in a particular behavior. 
900.69,"So, using this Lally study as an example, "
903.3,"some people would eat dinner, and then say, "
905.367,"""Oh, that's right, I've been trying to develop the habit"" "
907.367,"""of taking a walk after dinner."" "
908.977,"""So, let's get up and go."" "
910.47,"Other people will feel like, "
911.303,"""I just don't want to do it today."" "
912.67,They're going to feel too much limbic friction 
914.64,"and that limbic friction could arrive, again, "
916.75,from one of two sources. 
918.11,It could be because they are too tired to do it 
920.55,or it could be because they're too anxious 
922.69,and distracted in order to do it. 
925.0,"So, this is a key distinction. "
927.19,A lot of habit formation has to do 
929.08,with being in the right state of mind 
930.96,and being able to control your state of body and mind. 
934.42,"So as we march forward, "
935.44,what you're going to find is that this phrase 
937.325,"or this term, limbic friction, "
939.0,is going to be a useful metric 
940.62,or a way for you to touch in with yourself 
942.83,and address whether or not you are likely 
945.04,to be able to form a certain habit easily 
947.14,or whether or not it's going to be very challenging. 
949.23,And I'm going to teach you a way 
950.75,to measure your degree of limbic friction. 
953.16,"That is, how much activation energy it will take "
955.73,in order for you to execute a new habit. 
958.71,And I'm going to teach you 
960.0,how to measure your limbic friction 
961.59,and activation energy for how likely it is 
963.97,that you're going to be able to break a habit 
966.34,that you don't want to have. 
967.96,The other key concept for us to address 
970.2,that's really mainly found in the books 
972.24,"and articles out there about habits, "
974.22,is this notions of what I call linchpin habits. 
976.85,Linchpin habits are certain habits 
978.91,that make a lot of other habits easier to execute. 
981.669,"Now, the sorts of linchpin habits "
983.88,that I'm referring to are always going to be things 
986.22,that you enjoy doing. 
987.91,I'll just give you an example from my life. 
989.827,I happen to like exercise. 
991.726,"Not all forms of exercise, "
993.306,but I happen to like resistance training 
995.8,and I happen to like running. 
997.26,So I'm personally in the habit 
998.35,of getting cardiovascular exercise 
3,or 
4,times per week. 
1001.48,Maybe 
30-,
60,minutes per session. 
1004.15,And I'm in the habit of doing resistance training 
3,
1006.91,or 
4,"times per week, "
1008.38,typically also for about 
45,to 
60,minutes per session. 
1011.99,"Now, I enjoy those, "
1013.169,"and for reasons that I'll get into a little bit later, "
1015.81,I enjoy those activities typically early in the day 
1018.723,because of the neurochemistry 
1020.186,"and the various types of hormones, et cetera, "
1023.02,that are associates with performing those activities. 
1025.89,But I really place those activities under the umbrella 
1029.41,of what I call linchpin habits. 
1032.03,Why? Because those particular habits are easy 
1034.76,to execute because I enjoy them. 
1036.54,But they also make a lot of other habits easier to execute. 
1040.56,"Things like being alert for work, "
1042.696,things like making sure 
1044.55,"that I get good sleep the night before, "
1046.28,"things like hydration, "
1047.53,things like making sure that I eat the foods 
1049.61,that are better for me than some of the other foods 
1052.32,that maybe I would more reflexively reach to 
1054.67,if I weren't doing that training. 
1056.42,"So certain habits act as linchpins, "
1059.21,meaning that they shift a lot of other things. 
1061.37,"They can control and bias the likelihood that, "
1064.174,"in this case you or me, "
1066.009,"will perform other habits that are harder to access, "
1069.023,that we have less of an affinity for. 
1072.14,"So again, "
1073.01,there's three concepts that we need to include here. 
1075.02,We've got identity-based versus goal-based habits. 
1078.04,We've got the concept that typically different habits 
1080.92,"take different periods of time to adopt, "
1083.07,depending on the person and the habit. 
1084.8,"And that there are these, what I call linchpin habits. "
1087.449,Certain habits that make other habits easier to execute. 
1091.03,And those linchpin habits 
1092.38,"always, always, always are things that we enjoy doing. "
1096.33,So our goal throughout this episode is for you to identify 
1099.05,"which habits are easy for you to perform, "
1102.09,"which ones are hard for you to perform, "
1104.04,and which habits you want to break. 
1106.02,"If you want to grab a pen and paper, you can do that. "
1108.1,"Or if you want to dictate some of that into your phone, "
1110.21,you can. 
1111.32,"But right now, actually, "
1112.36,"if you just want to think about these concepts, "
1114.38,"you can always go back later, "
1115.688,I'll be sure to spell out a very specific way 
1118.66,that you can chart out a map 
1120.41,towards forming particular habits 
1121.857,and breaking particular habits later on. 
1124.87,What I'd like us to do at this point is 
1127.29,to take that concepts of limbic friction 
1129.445,and for you to ask yourself 
1131.526,"what habits you perform on a daily basis, "
1134.478,and these could be things as basic 
1137.46,"as brushing your teeth before breakfast, "
1139.84,or brushing your teeth after breakfast. 
1141.27,"It could be, for instance, that you get exercise "
1143.95,"or you get it at a particular time of day, "
1145.51,"or even that you take a particular route to work, right? "
1148.32,We are very habitual 
1149.268,and we tend to do things more or less over and over 
1152.53,"in the same way, unless we intervene in ourselves. "
1155.15,That's just the way that we are wired. 
1156.703,So now I'd like you to shift 
1158.38,to thinking about a particular aspect of habits 
1161.17,and that's habit strength. 
1164.23,"Now, you all have different habits. "
1166.25,"You probably brush your teeth at a particular time of day, "
1168.32,"you probably exercise at particular times of week, "
1170.396,you probably go to the refrigerator in a very habitual way. 
1173.16,We are incredibly habitual organisms. 
1176.35,"Unless we intervene in our habits, "
1177.81,they tend to carry out the same way that they always have 
1180.2,once they've formed. 
1181.69,"So you can do this exercise now, "
1183.17,"you don't have to write this down if you don't want to, "
1184.83,but you certainly are welcome. 
1186.284,We're going to evaluate what's called habit strength. 
1189.3,That's not a concept that I created. 
1190.85,Habit strength is something 
1191.75,that you will find in the psychological literature. 
1194.21,Habit strength is measured by two main criteria. 
1197.43,"The first, is how context-dependent a give habit is. "
1201.777,"So, context dependence is, "
1203.979,"if you go from one environment to the next, "
1207.47,"do you tend to do the same thing, "
1209.05,"in the same way, at the same time of day? "
1211.29,"So, for instance, "
1212.123,brushing your teeth firs thing in the morning. 
1213.48,"Maybe some of you do that before breakfast, "
1215.08,"maybe some of you do that later, "
1216.35,"maybe some of you, like me, don't even eat breakfast. "
1218.377,"But when I travel, I tend to brush my teeth at more "
1222.13,or less the same time of day relative to when I wake up 
1225.46,as I do when I'm at home. 
1226.45,So it's context independent. 
1228.31,"So it's a very strong habit, right? "
1231.44,"There are certain behaviors, "
1233.281,"like perhaps what you eat, "
1235.568,"or, you know, perhaps how you dress, "
1238.3,"that are context independent, "
1240.51,"that you might perform one way in one context, "
1243.483,and another way in another context. 
1245.8,The other aspect of habit strength is 
1247.61,how much limbic friction is required 
1249.76,to perform that habit on a regular basis. 
1252.04,This is extremely important 
1253.62,because if you are in the process of building habits 
1257.34,"and consolidating those habits, "
1259.193,then it's probably going to take more limbic friction 
1263.65,to execute those habits. 
1265.27,What do I mean by that? 
1266.103,"Well, let's say you set out to get, "
1268.726,let's say 
45,"minutes of zone II cardio exercise every day, "
1272.71,
5,or maybe even 
7,days a week. 
1274.819,"Well, if at first you're highly motivated, "
1278.34,limbic friction might be pretty low. 
1280.54,"Limbic friction is how much top-down, "
1282.74,"meaning from your fore-brain to your limbic system, "
1284.94,"the part of you brain that generates autonomic responses, "
1287.8,"how much limbic friction, "
1290.27,meaning conscious over-ride of your state is required 
1295.44,in order to engage in that particular behavior. 
1297.44,"So, if you're feeling particularly tired "
1298.76,"and you don't want to get out of bed, "
1300.16,"and you don't want to go out and do your zone II cardio, "
1302.003,then there's a high degree of limbic friction. 
1304.534,"It takes, some people think of it as motivation, "
1307.34,"but motivation is a bit of a vague concept, "
1309.33,whereas limbic friction involves specific neural circuits 
1311.95,and you can think of it in a more or less quantitative way. 
1314.31,"You can think of that your body is very tired, "
1316.82,so it's going to take more limbic friction 
1318.46,in order to get into action. 
1320.3,Right? 
1321.133,"You're going to have to overcome more limbic friction, "
1322.42,excuse me. 
1323.253,"Whereas if you're very, very alert, "
1324.906,there's less limbic friction 
1326.68,because you're moving toward something 
1328.21,that's action oriented. 
1329.84,"However, the inverse is also true. "
1331.628,"Let's say that you are trying to get into the habit, "
1334.66,or you're in the early stages of forming a habit 
1336.91,to meditate regularly. 
1338.245,"That's a pretty quiescent or calming activity, "
1342.04,so if you're somebody who comes home from work 
1343.59,and you're very anxious and you have a lot of work to do 
1346.36,"and you have to deal with a bunch of things, "
1348.03,there's a lot of limbic friction to overcome 
1350.29,in order to get into that calm state. 
1352.426,"So these two aspects, context dependence, "
1355.86,whether or not you're like to do the thing 
1357.52,regardless of where you are. 
1359.62,"Right? On travel, at home, on vacation, "
1362.15,"with people around, not people around, et cetera. "
1364.52,And how much limbic friction is required 
1366.671,"to execute that habit, "
1368.43,will tell you whether or not that habit is deeply 
1370.55,or just shallowly embedded within your nervous system. 
1374.47,The goal of any habit that we want to form 
1376.71,is to get into what's called automaticity. 
1378.96,Automaticity is fancy language 
1380.85,"for the neural circuits can perform it automatically, "
1383.58,and that's the ultimate place to be. 
1385.557,"All right, if you have all these goals "
1388.344,"and things that you want to be doing on a regular basis, "
1390.4,you'd love for them to be habitual 
1392.04,"because it takes less mental and physical effort, "
1394.693,"less limbic friction, "
1396.34,in order to execute those. 
1397.87,"And so much of what's out there, "
1399.87,"again in the popular psychology literature, "
1402.36,in books that you'll find on the bookstore shelf 
1404.36,"and on Amazon, and in the airports, "
1406.15,are about how to get 
1407.45,from that mode of high degree of limbic friction 
1409.87,to automaticity. 
1411.17,"And they offer a number of different ways, "
1413.07,"I think many of which are useful, "
1414.497,trying to get you to organize different types of habits 
1417.22,"into different bins, like value-based, and goal-based, "
1419.99,and trying to persuade you 
1421.43,that structuring habits at the particular times of day 
1423.93,"or in a particular way are going to be beneficial, "
1426.07,"and indeed, I think they have helped a lot of people. "
1428.48,So what I'd like to do is to take the scientific literature 
1431.89,of how the nervous system learns 
1433.61,"and engages in plasticity, "
1435.4,"and apply that to habit formation, "
1438.04,"habit maintenance, and if so desired, "
1440.92,how to break particular habits. 
1443.06,I'd like to give you a particular tool 
1444.85,that's gleaned from the research psychology literature. 
1447.45,I should mention that I learned about this 
1450.58,from an excellent review article 
1452.59,that's available online. 
1453.57,It's called Psychology of Habit. 
1455.39,"The authors are Wendy Wood and Dennis Ruenger, "
1458.09,this is published in Annual Review of Psychology. 
1461.25,The Annual Reviews series is a very high quality series. 
1465.004,"There are annual reviews of neuroscience, "
1467.73,"annual reviews of psychology, "
1469.07,"annual reviews of nutrition science, et cetera. "
1471.27,For those of you 
1472.103,that are interested in exploring review articles 
1474.06,"that are grounded in hundreds of quality, "
1477.01,"peer-reviewed studies, "
1478.49,the Annual Review series is really terrific. 
1481.09,"Certainly among the best, if not the best. "
1483.32,And they also tend to be quite long and quite comprehensive. 
1485.91,"So this review, Psychology of Habit by Wood "
1486.743,"and Ruenger, is excellent. "
1489.728,"And here I'm more or less paraphrasing from them, "
1493.43,"so I want to be clear that these are their words, not mine. "
1497.01,They're talking about the various ways 
1499.639,that habits form in the nervous system 
1501.617,"and they mention, with each repetition of a habit, "
1505.997,small changes occur in the cognitive and neural mechanisms 
1509.199,associated with procedural memory. 
1511.68,So I just want to talk for a second 
1512.99,about what procedural memory is. 
1514.578,"In the neuroscience of memory, "
1516.67,we distinguish between what's called episodic memory 
1519.31,and procedural memory. 
1520.89,Episodic memory is a recall of a particular set of events 
1524.93,"that happened, "
1525.763,whereas procedural memory 
1527.06,is holding in mind the specific sequence of things 
1529.84,that need to happen 
1530.78,in order for a particular outcome to occur. 
1532.545,"So think of it like a recipe or a protocol, "
1535.353,"or for the sake of exercise, "
1537.48,"it's like sets and reps, "
1538.56,"or a particular course that you're going to run or cycle, "
1541.57,or the number of laps you're going to swim 
1543.5,and how you're going to perform it. 
1545.642,"It's very clear that for anyone trying to adopt new habits, "
1549.838,getting into the mindset of procedural memory is very useful 
1554.04,for overcoming that barrier that we call limbic friction. 
1556.97,How do you do that? 
1557.96,"Well, a simple visualization exercise, "
1560.66,or it doesn't even have to be done eyes closed. 
1563.377,"You know, often times we hear visualization exercise, "
1565.64,"you think about sitting in a lotus position, eyes closed, "
1567.79,"you know, trying really hard to visualize something. "
1570.04,Doesn't need to be anything like that. 
1572.01,"It can simply be, if you are deciding to adopt a new habit, "
1576.259,to just think about the very specific sequence of steps 
1579.89,that's required to execute that habit. 
1582.492,"And I'll use a trivial example, "
1584.654,but this could be applied to anything. 
1586.66,"Let's say I want to get into the habit of making myself, "
1589.67,"or someone else in my household, "
1591.13,"a cup of espresso every morning, "
1593.039,I would actually think through each of those steps. 
1596.69,"Walk into the kitchen, turn on the espresso machine, "
1600.25,draw the espresso. 
1601.27,"Walking through each of those steps, from start to finish, "
1604.12,and it turns out just that simple mental exercise done once 
1607.423,can shift people towards a much higher likelihood 
1610.69,"of performing that habit regularly, "
1613.09,"not just the first time, "
1614.47,but as they continue out into the days 
1616.99,and weeks that follow. 
1618.17,So that's remarkable to me 
1619.3,and the literature is really robust. 
1621.33,Just one mental exercise of thinking through 
1624.043,what are the sequence of steps required 
1627.07,in order to perform this habit from start to finish 
1629.304,can shift the likelihood of being able to perform that habit 
1633.39,"from unlikely or moderately likely, "
1635.79,to very likely over time. 
1637.47,And that's because it pulls from this process 
1640.225,that involves our hippocampus and our neocortex 
1642.93,"and other areas of our brain and nervous system, "
1645.35,that engage in procedural memory. 
1646.91,"It shifts the brain towards a mindset, if you will. "
1649.824,"It's more of a neural circuit set, would be more accurate. "
1653.63,But a mindset/neural circuit set 
1656.66,"of doing things in a particular sequence, "
1659.0,which allows that limbic friction to come down 
1661.79,and increases the likelihood 
1663.23,that we're going to perform that thing. 
1665.506,"Simple tool but very powerful too, "
1666.907,according to the psychology literature. 
1668.55,"And actually, the cellular and molecular mechanisms "
1670.78,"that underlie that sort of procedural memory, "
1673.73,stepping through phenomenon are known. 
1676.383,"In this article I mentioned, this beautiful review, "
1679.87,they talk about so called Hebbian learning. 
1683.54,Donald Hebb was a psychologist in Canada 
1686.25,"and birthed this field that has now lasted, gosh, "
1689.88,more than 
50,years and is still very strong 
1691.91,in neuroscience and psychology of Hebbian learning. 
1694.7,"Hebbian learning is when particular neurons are co-active, "
1698.39,"meaning when they fire together, "
1699.68,they tend to strengthen their connections 
1701.54,with one another. 
1702.41,And it has a number of different cellular 
1704.39,and molecular features 
1705.36,"that we don't have to go into in detail, "
1706.76,"but for those of you that want to know, "
1708.01,I know some of you are hungry 
1709.08,"for a little bit more neuroscience, "
1711.466,this involves things like NMDA receptors 
1714.7,and methyl-D-aspartate receptors. 
1717.153,NMDA receptors are really important I think 
1719.18,for everyone to understand. 
1720.69,So I'll just tell you a little bit about them. 
1722.29,These are receptors that are on the neuron's surface 
1725.11,and normally they don't contribute much 
1726.84,to the activity of those neurons. 
1728.47,Those neurons are perfectly capable of doing their thing 
1730.72,without activation of this NMDA receptor. 
1733.26,"But when a neuron gets a very strong input, "
1735.9,"a strong stimulus, "
1737.44,that NMDA receptor triggers a number of mechanisms 
1740.374,that recruit 
1741.85,to the surface of the neuron more other receptors. 
1744.45,"In other words, it makes that neuron more responsive "
1747.46,to input in the future 
1748.647,such that it doesn't require so much input. 
1751.41,"In other words, it takes a neuron "
1754.153,that is very unlikely to fire 
1756.221,and makes it more likely to fire. 
1758.44,So this procedural stepping through 
1760.37,of the steps of the recipe 
1761.67,or the series of actions steps that are involved 
1764.44,"in sitting down to study and writing for an hour, "
1767.16,"or generating exercise, "
1768.74,whatever is the habit that you're trying to learn. 
1770.65,"When you're doing that exercise, "
1772.37,it's not as if your nervous system 
1773.73,thinks you're actually performing that behavior. 
1775.59,Your nervous system isn't stupid. 
1776.88,It's actually a lot smarter than that. 
1778.53,"It knows the difference between a thought and an action, "
1781.09,"but when you do that, "
1782.17,it sets in motion the same neurons 
1784.37,that are going to be required 
1786.06,for the execution of that habit. 
1787.92,"And so when you actually show up to perform that habit, "
1790.436,it's as if the dominoes fall more easily. 
1793.6,"It's a lower threshold, as we say, "
1796.48,in order to get the habit to perform. 
1798.53,"So, Hebbian learning, NMDA receptors, "
1800.87,all that nuts and bolts stuff. 
1803.33,Really the guts of the mechanisms of how this works. 
1805.7,But for those of you that just want 
1807.811,"to be more habitual about certain things, "
1809.96,"be able to perform certain things more reflexively, "
1811.95,"that you would like in your life, "
1813.22,"simply take the time, do it once, maybe twice, "
1816.2,"and just sit down, close your eyes if you like, "
1818.65,and just step through the procedure 
1820.22,of what it's going to take in order to perform that habit. 
1822.772,"The psychology literature, as I mentioned, "
1825.13,"and also the neuroscience literature, "
1826.926,strongly supports the fact 
1828.649,that it is going to make it far easier 
1831.24,for you to adopt and maintain that habit. 
1833.68,"And if you are somebody who used to perform a habit, "
1836.6,"and you don't understand why you dropped it, "
1839.06,"and you're frustrated with yourself, "
1840.55,and you're trying to figure out 
1841.72,"how you can get back into that habit, "
1843.8,"well by all means, "
1844.81,"lean right back into that habit, "
1846.15,"but if you're having trouble doing that, "
1847.487,also just use the procedural memory exercise 
1850.265,in order to shift your nervous system 
1852.502,towards a higher likelihood 
1854.777,that you will return to that habit 
1857.14,just the same way I described for trying 
1859.13,to initiate a new habit. 
1860.81,"So now I'd like to discuss a second, "
1862.48,and what I think is perhaps the most powerful tool 
1865.115,for being able to acquire and stick to new habits. 
1870.29,This tool is rooted in what we call neural circuits 
1872.71,and I do think it is important to understand a little bit 
1875.21,about how those neural circuits work. 
1877.42,"For those of you that are saying, "
1878.327,"""Just tell me what to do."" "
1880.21,"I have to say, as I always say, "
1882.31,understanding a little bit or a lot of underlying mechanism 
1885.503,will help solidify these concepts for you 
1889.22,and will help ensure that the tools 
1891.22,that I offer are going to make sense 
1893.24,and that they're going 
1894.073,to make sense in differing contexts 
1895.38,and for different types of habits 
1896.88,that you're tying to learn. 
1898.18,"So, rather than just tell you what to do, "
1899.87,"I'm going to tell you how this particular tool works, "
1902.247,"and then in doing that, "
1903.77,"you should be able to apply it to any habit, "
1905.55,under any conditions. 
1906.792,The tool that I'm referring to 
1908.776,is something called task-bracketing 
1911.81,and the neural circuits associated with task-bracketing 
1914.92,are basically the neural circuits 
1916.57,that are going to allow you to learn any new type of habit 
1920.13,or break any habit that you'd like to break. 
1922.568,We have in our brain a set of neural circuits 
1925.9,that fall under the umbrella term of the basal ganglia. 
1928.73,"The basal ganglia are involved in action execution, "
1932.04,"meaning doing certain things, "
1933.59,"and action suppression, not doing certain things. "
1938.54,"In the experimental realm, "
1940.19,"these are referred to as go, meaning do, "
1942.62,"or no go, don't do, certain things. "
1945.136,And some of us fall more into the category 
1947.88,"of we find it very easy to do certain things, "
1949.839,but harder to not do other things. 
1952.97,Some people have a lot of no go type circuits 
1956.82,"that are very robust, "
1957.87,"and they have a lot of behavioral constraint, "
1959.746,but they have a harder time getting into action. 
1962.01,"And some people have a perfect balance of both, "
1963.95,but I've never met one of those people. 
1965.826,"So again, drawing from, more or less paraphrasing "
1969.73,from this beautiful review that I described earlier 
1972.94,"in Annual Review of Psychology, excuse me, "
1976.52,"by Wood and Ruenger, "
1977.821,task-bracketing involves a particular set of neural circuits 
1981.92,"within the basal ganglia, "
1983.65,"so I'm going to describe this here, again paraphrasing, "
1987.24,a sensory-motor loop. 
1988.51,"Sensory means just input coming in about sight, sounds, "
1992.88,"taste, et cetera. "
1994.17,"And then the motor systems, "
1995.79,"the systems of the brain and body that generate action, "
1998.48,taking that information and generating action. 
2000.788,So it turns out that there's an area of our basal ganglia 
2004.45,"called the dorsolateral striatum, "
2006.57,we can use the acronym DLS. 
2008.57,"Again, dorsolateral striatum. "
2011.24,Dorso means up. Lateral means to the side. 
2013.25,So dorsolateral. 
2014.083,And striatum is a subdivision of the basal ganglia. 
2017.76,And it's very important 
2019.383,for the establishment of behaviors 
2022.23,"that are associated with a habit, "
2024.24,but not necessarily the habit itself. 
2026.694,And beautiful studies in both animals and humans 
2030.22,that record the activity in the dorsolateral striatum 
2033.67,"find that the dorsolateral striatum is associated, "
2037.43,meaning it becomes active at the beginning 
2039.765,"of a particular habit, "
2041.748,and at the very end and after a particular habit. 
2045.43,Hence the phrase task-bracketing. 
2047.73,It brackets the habit. 
2049.4,"Now, other sets of neurons are going to be active "
2051.46,"during the actual execution of the habit, "
2053.734,but what the literature on the dorsolateral striatum 
2057.28,tells us is that we have particular circuits in our brain 
2061.62,that are devoted to framing the events 
2064.38,that happened just before 
2066.3,"and as we initiate a habit, "
2067.86,and just after and as we terminate a habit. 
2070.75,"In other words, it acts as a sort of marker "
2073.11,"for the habit execution, "
2074.32,but not the execution of the habit per se. 
2077.35,This is very important 
2078.61,because task-bracketing is what underlies whether 
2082.88,"or not a habit will be context dependent or not, "
2086.32,whether or not it will be strong 
2088.07,and likely to occur 
2089.43,"even if we didn't get good night's sleep the night before, "
2091.65,"even if we're feeling distracted, "
2093.41,"even if we're not feeling like doing something emotionally, "
2096.83,"or if we are, you know, completely overwhelmed "
2099.79,by other events. 
2100.645,"If the neural circuits are task bracketing, "
2103.481,"are deeply embedded in us, "
2105.51,"meaning they are very robust around a particular habit, "
2108.61,well then it's likely that we're going to go out 
2110.23,"for that zone II cardio no matter what, "
2112.4,that we're going to brush our teeth no matter what. 
2113.997,"I'm fact, brushing our teeth is a pretty good example "
2116.1,"because, for most people, "
2117.65,"even if you got a terrible night's sleep, "
2119.003,"even If everything in your life is going wrong, "
2122.87,"chances are, unless you're very depressed, "
2125.46,"if you're going to leave to work, "
2126.6,"or even if you're not, "
2127.89,that you're going to still carry out the behavior 
2130.3,of brushing your teeth in the morning. 
2131.61,"I would hope so, actually. "
2133.25,But you are probably less likely 
2135.48,to perform particular habits 
2137.54,that are not what you deem as necessary. 
2141.04,"But if you think about it, "
2142.75,"brushing your teeth, exercise, eating particular foods, "
2145.75,"maybe engaging socially in particular ways, "
2149.05,you are the one that places any kind of value assessment 
2151.41,"on which ones are essential, "
2152.78,and which ones are negotiable. 
2154.81,"So task-bracketing sets a neural imprint, "
2158.62,"a kind of a finger print in your brain, "
2160.17,of this thing has to happen at this particular time of day 
2163.33,so much so that it's reflexive. 
2165.61,"And as we'll talk about in a moment, "
2167.37,there's a way that you can build up task-bracketing 
2170.75,"so that regardless of what it is you're trying to learn, "
2173.67,there's a much higher probability 
2175.49,that you're going to do that thing. 
2177.26,"And when I say learn, "
2178.093,meaning let's say you're trying to acquire a habit 
2180.25,that for you is really challenging. 
2181.66,Maybe it's that you're going to write for an hour a day 
2184.24,on a book project that you've been thinking about 
2186.19,"or you're going to work on mathematics, "
2188.25,or you're going to do any sort of thing 
2189.94,that for you there's a lot of limbic friction. 
2192.057,While it is important to think about the sequence of events 
2195.9,"that would be required in order to engage in that behavior, "
2198.46,that procedural memory visualization exercise 
2201.02,"we talked about before, that will help, "
2202.832,there's a way also that you can orient your nervous system 
2206.391,"towards this task-bracketing process, "
2209.213,so that your nervous system is shifted 
2212.21,or oriented towards the execution of a given habit. 
2215.56,So this is sort of like warming up your body to exercise. 
2219.16,"When the dorsolateral striatum is engaged, "
2221.69,your body and you brain are primed to execute a habit 
2224.87,and that you get to consciously insert 
2226.66,which habit you want to perform. 
2228.22,So in order to leverage the neural mechanisms 
2230.136,"of task-bracketing, "
2231.513,in order to increase the likelihood 
2233.89,"that you're going to perform a particular habit, "
2236.64,I have to break it to you 
2238.36,that one thing that you've probably heard over and over 
2241.72,about habit formation 
2243.03,is not true. 
2244.695,And what I'm referring to is this idea 
2247.27,that if you're very specific about exactly when you're going 
2250.58,"to perform a particular habit, "
2252.91,that you're more likely to perform that habit. 
2255.53,"And while that is true in the short term, "
2258.57,it is not true in the long term. 
2260.813,And the reason for that is that our nervous system tends 
2264.27,to generate particular kinds of behavior 
2266.72,"based not on time, but on our state. "
2270.109,Meaning what level of activation is taking place 
2273.42,in our brain and body. 
2274.45,"How much focus we happen to have, "
2276.1,"how fatigued we are, how energized we are. "
2279.36,"So while schedules are important, "
2281.86,it's not the particular time of day per se 
2285.21,"that's going to allow you to get into a habit, "
2288.03,"and form that habit, and consolidate that habit. "
2290.66,"Rather, it's the state that your brain "
2293.12,and body are in that's important to anchor yourself to. 
2296.25,So now I'm going to offer you a tool. 
2298.3,It's actually an entire program 
2299.815,by which you can insert particular habits and activities 
2303.65,"at particular phases of the day, "
2305.48,"not times of day, but phases of the day, "
2307.86,because it turns out that particular phases of the day 
2310.6,"are associated with particular biological underpinnings, "
2313.91,"chemicals and neural circuits and so forth, "
2316.27,and in doing so it will make it far more likely 
2319.04,that you will be able to regularly engage in these habits 
2321.797,and activities over a long period of time. 
2324.707,And whether or not that will move you from somebody 
2326.79,who ordinarily would take 
200,days to form a habit 
2329.93,to one of those 
18,days to habit people 
2332.78,"in that earlier study I mentioned, I don't know. "
2334.68,But I am certain that will have a significant shift 
2337.98,on allowing you to engage in particular habits more easily 
2341.4,and to consolidate those habits more quickly. 
2343.71,"So the program I am about to describe, "
2345.62,"I formulated for you based on the neuroscience literature, "
2349.15,"and the psychology literature of learning, "
2350.8,and this concepts of task-bracketing. 
2353.08,It involves the 
24,hour days into what I call three phases. 
2357.47,"The first is phase one, "
2359.32,which is 
0,to 
8,"hours after waking up, approximately. "
2364.02,"Okay, you can put a plus or minus "
30,minutes on this 
2366.84,for yourself. 
2368.22,The second phase is the 
9,to 
"14,",maybe 
15,hours 
2372.517,after you wake up. 
2374.199,And the third phase is 
16,to 
24,hours after waking up. 
2378.21,So we've taken the 
24,"hour cycle, "
2379.77,"we've carved it up into three phases, "
2381.73,"phase one, phase two, and phase three. "
2383.95,"Now, everything I'm describing, "
2385.84,"or at least the way I'm going to describe it, "
2387.79,"is based on what I would call a typical schedule, "
2390.42,diurnal schedule. 
2391.58,You've heard of nocturnal? 
2392.61,"Well, we are diurnal. "
2394.38,Most of us are asleep at night and awake during the day. 
2396.89,I do realize that a number of people have shift work 
2400.11,or they have newborns or other reasons 
2402.18,why they have to be up in the middle of the night 
2403.73,and sleeping during the day. 
2405.113,"If that's the case, "
2406.2,please listen to the episode we did on jet-lag 
2409.5,and shift work because that has a lot of tools 
2411.25,specifically for that population. 
2413.49,But most people go to sleep somewhere around 
10:,
00,"PM, "
2417.22,"plus or minus two hours, "
2418.69,and wake up some time around 
7:,
00,"AM, "
2421.43,plus or minus two hours. 
2423.09,"So today, I'm going to use the to bed at "
10:,
00,PM 
2426.2,and a wake up time of 
7:,
00,"AM as the framework for this, "
2430.38,but you could adopt it easily to your particular schedule. 
2433.334,"Phase one, which again, is "
0,to 
8,"hours after waking, "
2437.409,has a particular neurochemical signature. 
2440.66,"Regardless of what you do, "
2442.659,the neuromodulators norepinephrine 
2445.016,"as well as epinephrine, "
2446.63,"so that's noradrenaline and adrenaline, "
2448.71,as well as the neuromodulator dopamine 
2451.08,tend to be elevated during that first 
0,to 
8,hours 
2454.28,after waking. 
2455.91,There are a number of reasons for this related to the fact 
2459.376,"that also cortisol is higher in our brain and bloodstream, "
2461.68,"it's a healthy level of cortisol upon waking, "
2463.86,"body temperature is increased, et cetera. "
2465.88,And there's several things 
2467.08,"that perhaps we should all be doing, "
2468.82,"I've talked about many of these on the podcast before, "
2470.819,"that in addition to those chemicals, "
2473.69,further support an alert and focused state. 
2477.12,And I'll just list those off. 
2478.47,I've done many podcasts on each of these 
2480.89,if you'd like to access those podcasts you can find them 
2483.235,"in the menu of podcasts on YouTube, "
2485.99,"Apple, Spotify, et cetera. "
2487.51,"They involve, for instance, "
2488.83,viewing sunlight or bright artificial light 
2492.01,"if you can't access sunlight, "
2493.16,within the first 
30,minutes of waking. 
2495.67,Physical exercise of some kind 
2497.443,"in this phase of the day, "
0,to 
8,"hours of the day, "
2501.1,"ideally pretty early in that phase, "
2503.42,"but, you know, "
2504.253,if it has to be at the 
7,to 
8,hour transition point 
2507.3,that's fine too. 
2508.44,Cold exposure in the form of cold showers or ice baths 
2511.75,"or outside with minimal clothing, "
2514.477,appropriate yet minimal clothing. 
2517.514,Caffeine ingestion. 
2519.597,"Fasting, for instance, not ingesting calories, "
2524.52,also will lend itself to increased norepinephrine 
2526.977,"and dopamine, et cetera. "
2528.73,"If you are going to consume foods, "
2530.19,"foods that are rich in things like tyrosine, "
2532.41,which is a precursor for dopamine. 
2534.053,You can look up foods that are high in tyrosine. 
2537.32,And for those of you that are interested in supplementation 
2539.68,"and like to use those routes, "
2541.1,"things like alpha GPC or phenylethylamine, think, "
2544.72,"or L-tyrosine, "
2545.76,if that's in keeping with what you're able to do. 
2548.47,"Of course, consult your doctor "
2550.06,if you're going to rely on supplementation. 
2552.27,What's this all about? 
2553.14,"Well, the already elevated norepinephrine "
2555.76,"and dopamine, the sunlight, exercise, "
2558.68,"cold exposure, caffeine, tyrosine, et cetera, "
2561.43,all of those place the brain and body into a state 
2564.618,"in which you are better able, "
2568.32,"or I would say, more easily able, "
2570.42,to engage in activities 
2572.41,that have a high degree limbic friction 
2575.66,and where you need to override that limbic friction. 
2578.3,"Right? We've heard that the morning is kind of sacred, "
2580.67,"conquer the hardest things first thing in the morning, "
2582.62,and that's been discussed in the pop psychology literature 
2585.82,and in the habit formation literature 
2588.06,merely from the perspective of 
2590.29,get it out of the way so you can feel good 
2591.9,about having done it. 
2593.49,But what I'm referring to is quite different. 
2595.05,What I'm referring to is a particular phase of day 
2597.143,"that after rising, after waking up, that is, "
2600.298,for 
0,to 
8,"hours, right, in that first phase, "
2604.13,your whole system is action and focus oriented. 
2607.5,And we know that when you're action and focus oriented 
2610.34,and because of the neurochemicals 
2612.54,that are naturally released in your brain and body 
2615.187,that you will be more likely to overcome any limbic friction 
2619.64,that stands in the way of performing particular habits. 
2622.74,"So, as you list out or think about the various habits "
2626.09,"that you'd like to adopt in your life, take the habits "
2630.01,for which you know there's the highest degree 
2632.37,"of limbic friction, "
2633.53,"they are the hardest for you to engage in, "
2635.6,"they require the most activation energy, "
2637.93,and put those in this 
0,to 
8,hours after waking. 
2641.616,This will greatly facilitate your performance 
2645.34,of those new habits. 
2646.5,I'm certain of that. 
2647.618,"And in addition to that, "
2649.57,"by doing them in this particular phase of the day, "
2652.57,"not necessarily the same time, "
2654.02,"I mean, if you want to be very habitual, "
2655.45,"and you want to do, you know, the exercise, "
2657.16,"or the sunlight viewing always at the same time, "
2659.4,"or you want to do, "
2660.61,you want to drink your caffeine 
2662.03,"always at the exact same time, that's fine, "
2663.59,but by placing them in this broader window 
2666.33,of 
0,to 
8,"hours after waking, "
2668.533,what you're doing is you're creating task-bracketing. 
2672.04,You're making it such that your nervous system 
2674.23,will predict when you are going to lean in 
2677.14,against limbic friction 
2678.63,in order to perform particular types of habits. 
2681.41,"And this is very different than saying, "
2683.277,"""I'm always going to run"" or, "
2684.917,"""I'm always going to study from "
10,to 
12,"AM every morning."" "
2689.14,"That's great, and if you can do that, terrific. "
2691.51,"But the literature indicates that people who do that, "
2693.73,"who are very rigid about when they do things tend, "
2695.742,"because of context dependence, "
2697.79,to not necessarily stick to those habits over time. 
2700.98,"Some people do, but many, many people don't. "
2704.0,So think about the hardest habits to form 
2706.06,and the habits that you most want to form 
2708.89,that are hardest for you to adopt and to maintain 
2711.44,and I highly suggest placing those somewhere 
2714.327,within this phase one of 
0,to 
8,hours after waking. 
2718.52,"Now of course, some of the things I listed out, "
2720.75,"sunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure, "
2723.019,"caffeine, fasting, "
2724.64,"those might be the actual habits themselves, "
2726.4,"but here I realize, or rather I want to acknowledge "
2730.081,"that many people, including myself, "
2732.064,are doing some or all of these things already 
2734.73,"and many people, including myself, "
2736.78,are trying to adopt new habits 
2738.64,that don't fall into the category 
2740.44,of just trying to set your overall state. 
2742.82,"Again, norepinephrine, dopamine, "
2744.81,and all these neural systems 
2746.06,will be greatly elevated in this 
0,to 
8,hours after waking. 
2749.7,"However, the other things I mentioned, "
2751.51,"sunlight exposure, exercise, cold exposure, "
2753.92,"caffeine, fasting, if that's for you, "
2756.2,"or if you're eating during that phase, "
2758.201,eating things that contain some 
2760.1,"or elevated levels of tyrosine, "
2761.66,"maybe supplementing alpha GPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera. "
2765.133,All of those things further facilitate the neurochemistry 
2769.431,and therefore the state of mind 
2771.28,that's going to be ideal for leaning into limbic friction 
2774.55,and overriding that limbic friction 
2776.16,so that you can regularly perform that habit. 
2778.15,What we're really talking about here 
2779.32,is leveraging neural systems 
2781.29,in order to help you make it more likely 
2784.13,that you're going to be able to engage 
2785.74,and maintain a particular habit. 
2787.66,So what I'm referring to as phase one of each day is useful 
2791.57,"for acquiring certain habits, "
2793.62,"but there are other phases of the day, "
2795.42,and those turn out to be useful 
2796.8,for acquiring other types of habits. 
2798.641,"Phase two, as I mentioned, is about, "
2801.225,"again these aren't specifics, "
2803.533,but about 
9,to 
14,or 
15,hours after waking. 
2807.442,"During this phase of the day, "
2809.94,"because of the circadian shifts in our biology, "
2813.001,the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine 
2815.29,that's circulating in our brain 
2816.57,and bloodstream tends to start to come down 
2819.809,and levels of cortisol tend to start to come down. 
2823.6,That's the ideal circumstance. 
2825.02,"In fact, "
2826.471,you don't really want elevated cortisol late in the day. 
2828.01,That's actually a signature of depression 
2829.73,and anxiety and a number of other unfortunate things. 
2833.977,"So, "
9,to 
14,hours after waking dopamine 
2838.23,"and norepinephrine and cortisol are starting to taper down, "
2840.7,just naturally. 
2841.66,"And a different neuromodulator, serotonin, "
2845.28,is starting to rise. 
2846.427,Serotonin is definitely going to be highest 
2849.84,in this second half of the day 
2851.95,and tends to lend itself to a more relaxed state of being. 
2856.69,"Now of course, "
2857.523,I do realize that some people are less of morning people 
2860.1,and do find that they really come alive 
2861.57,"and awake in the afternoon, "
2862.63,but most people don't fall into that category. 
2865.28,"Most people feel more alert early in the day, "
2867.62,"even anxious early in the day, "
2869.19,"and then, as the afternoon progresses, "
2870.68,"they tend to be a bit more sleepy, a bit more relaxed, "
2873.86,a bit more calm. 
2875.68,There's certain things that we all can 
2877.97,and should do during this phase two of each day 
2880.902,that lend themselves to a state of mind 
2883.851,and a state of body that is going to be beneficial 
2887.524,for the generation and consolidation 
2890.32,of certain types of habits. 
2891.97,What are those things? 
2892.85,"First of all, as the day goes on, "
2894.823,you should try if you can 
2896.63,to start tapering the amount of light that you're viewing. 
2899.364,"Now, this doesn't mean putting yourself "
2900.197,into dim light at 
3,o'clock 
4,o'clock in the afternoon. 
2905.775,That's certainly not the case. 
2906.608,Simply that you want to start tapering off the amount 
2909.2,"of really bright light that you're getting, "
2910.8,unless it's sunlight. 
2911.792,"Talked about this before on the podcast, "
2914.22,"but if you haven't heard, "
2915.82,viewing the sun as it's at what we call low solar angle 
2919.06,"so it's headed toward the horizon, "
2921.14,"you don't necessarily have to watch the sunset, "
2922.93,although that can be nice. 
2924.17,But getting some sun light in your eyes 
2925.55,in the second half of the day can also be beneficial 
2927.69,for a number of brain systems and psychological systems 
2930.598,"so you can get some some light in your eyes, "
2932.66,"you can certainly have artificial lights on, "
2935.53,but you want to start dimming those lights 
2938.246,and bringing them actually physically lower in the room 
2939.68,because the neurons in your eye 
2941.76,that view the upper visual field 
2944.4,they actually trigger this alertness mechanism 
2946.78,in the brain and body. 
2947.613,"And in the second half of the day, "
2949.18,even if you're humming around and doing work at 
3,
2951.71,or 
4,or 
5,or even 
7,"PM, "
2953.825,"you are probably headed toward sleep a few hours later, "
2957.73,so things like limiting the total amount of light 
2960.02,"if you can, "
2961.08,"things like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, "
2964.21,another thing that I've talked about on this podcast. 
2966.21,"If you haven't heard about this before, "
2967.43,non-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term 
2969.38,"for things like meditation, for Yoga Nidra, "
2972.7,a very powerful science supported tool 
2975.31,"for teaching you how to relax, "
2977.437,things like self-hypnosis 
2979.25,"which might sound a little kooky to some of you, "
2980.86,but actually is a clinically based tool 
2982.38,for which there's a lot of scientific literature. 
2984.68,If you're interested in that 
2985.61,"there's a great free resource called Reverie, "
2987.75,R E V E R I E .com. 
2989.842,There's a app for both Apple and Android. 
2993.08,This is an app that was developed by colleagues of mine 
2995.32,and researchers at Stanford School of Medicine. 
2997.6,You can do these short 
15,"self hypnosis script, "
3000.98,as they're called. 
3001.813,"They can teach you how to relax yourself, "
3003.83,"there's even one for focus, for sleep, for chronic pain, "
3006.708,"Again, all very strongly supported "
3009.04,by quality peer-reviewed literature. 
3011.26,"So things like Reverie, meditation, "
3013.325,"things like heat and sauna, hot baths, hot showers. "
3017.679,Those are terrific things to do in the second half 
3020.89,"of the day, "
3021.74,"they tend to support this serotonergic, "
3024.11,or high serotonin like state 
3025.99,and lend themselves to more calm and relaxation. 
3029.7,"For those that are interested in supplementation, "
3031.8,"there's always ashwagandha, "
3033.51,"which reduces cortisol, "
3035.61,again peaks in cortisol late in the afternoon 
3038.03,"and evening are associated with depression, "
3039.8,"anxiety, and so forth. "
3040.94,Ashwagandha has a pretty potent cortisol inhibiting tool. 
3046.179,I personally don't use it very often 
3048.79,and I caution people about using it 
3050.72,for longer than two-week periods of time 
3052.37,without taking some breaks. 
3053.65,You can look up more about ashwagandha on examine.com. 
3056.97,There's a lot of traffic literature 
3058.19,with links to studies there. 
3059.68,But basically this phase two of the day 
3061.81,"is one in which you're alert, you are present "
3064.26,"you are working, you are engaging socially, "
3066.18,"you're cooking dinner probably, "
3067.47,"paying attention to a number of things, "
3069.1,but you should really be trying 
3070.11,to taper off your stress level. 
3071.93,So how do you leverage phase two of the day 
3073.82,for habit formation? 
3075.325,"Well, given what we know "
3076.51,"about the neurochemistry of learning and memory, "
3078.67,given what we know about task formation 
3080.8,"and its reliance on certain forms of neuroplasticity, "
3083.323,the second half of the day is a terrific time 
3085.685,to take on habits and things that you're already doing 
3090.95,that require very little override of limbic friction. 
3094.3,So these might be things that categorize in common terms 
3098.77,as kind of mellower activities. 
3100.27,"It might be journaling, "
3101.439,it might be that you already are performing music 
3106.11,"or I should say, practicing music regularly, "
3108.371,but there's a particular type of music 
3110.54,that is hard for you 
3111.7,"or that you're working on a particular piece of music, "
3113.58,or you're trying to learn a language. 
3114.63,"Something that's a little bit challenging, "
3116.11,but doesn't require a ton of energy 
3118.91,in order to override that limbic friction. 
3121.09,The second half of the day is a much better time to do that. 
3123.61,"Less resistance, as we might say. "
3125.999,"But of course, resistance has a neural substrate "
3128.699,and the reason for doing those things 
3130.65,"in the second part of the day, the so-called phase two, "
3133.31,"as I've called it, part of the day is "
3135.12,because your ability 
3136.39,to override resistance is really diminished 
3139.04,in this second phase of the day. 
3140.999,"Some of you might say, "
3142.447,"""Whoa wait,"" "
3143.28,"""I like to exercise in the second half of the day."" "
3145.227,"""That's actually when I have the most energy."" "
3146.897,"""That's when I feel warmer"" "
3148.467,"""I'm not a morning exerciser."" "
3149.8,"That's absolutely fine, "
3151.77,but what I'm referring to is the acquisition 
3153.63,of new behaviors 
3154.736,and placing those consistently at the second half of the day 
3158.43,in order to engage these task-bracketing mechanisms 
3161.05,that I talked about before. 
3162.583,One of the hallmark features 
3164.67,of those basal ganglia circuits for go 
3166.78,and no-go is that they are associated 
3169.13,"with certain neurochemicals, dopamine and serotonin, "
3172.2,"acetylcholine, and other neurochemicals. "
3174.28,And by placing particular habits 
3176.681,"at particular phases of the day, "
3178.71,those neurochemical states start to be associated 
3181.22,"with the leaning in and the process of beginning, "
3184.02,"and as I mentioned, ending those particular habits. "
3186.85,And in doing so they shift the whole nervous system 
3189.73,toward being able to predict 
3190.881,that certain things are going to happen 
3192.81,"at particular times a day, "
3194.56,that you're going to be leaning very hard 
3196.68,"against limbic friction early in the day in phase one, "
3199.15,and that you're going to be doing things 
3200.37,that require less conscious override of limbic friction 
3203.59,in phase two. 
3204.423,"And in doing so, set up task-bracketing system "
3207.294,so that the individual habits that you're learning 
3210.66,or that you're trying to learn 
3212.12,have a much greater probability of being executed 
3215.01,"and consolidated, "
3216.13,meaning that pretty soon that they 
3218.05,will just naturally become reflexive. 
3220.32,"And as with phase one, many of the things that I mentioned "
3224.01,"that support this, what I'm calling a serotonergic state "
3227.7,"or more relaxed state in phase two, "
3229.616,"things like seeing sunlight in the afternoon, "
3232.751,"but not a lot of bright light from artificial sources, "
3236.64,"things like NSDR, "
3238.05,"things like heat and sauna, "
3240.284,"hot baths et cetera, ashwagandha, "
3242.542,again all of those things themselves could be habits 
3245.21,"that you're trying to adopt, right? "
3246.98,"In that case, do those if you'd like to explore them. "
3250.11,"They are quite beneficial for a number of reasons, "
3253.0,not just related to execution of particular habits 
3255.51,"in phase two of the day, "
3256.87,but also for improving quality of sleep 
3259.32,and consolidating any learning 
3260.98,that you might have triggered earlier in the day. 
3262.6,"I've talked about that before, "
3263.65,"but just briefly, as a relevant aside, "
3266.177,"neuroplasticity involves triggering the neural plasticity, "
3270.1,"setting it in motion, "
3271.46,but the actual rewiring of the brain 
3273.67,and the reconfiguration of neurons 
3275.17,"that will allow that learning to be reflexive, "
3277.24,"that actually occurs during states of deep rest, "
3279.43,like an NSDR and like deep sleep. 
3282.389,"And I should just mention, "
3283.808,for those of you that can only exercise 
3286.32,"or prefer to exercise in phase two of the day, right, "
3290.16,
9,to 
14,hours or 
15,"hours after waking, "
3292.728,that's absolutely fine. 
3294.599,"However, because of the importance of sleep "
3297.708,and in particular deep sleep throughout the night 
3300.25,"for not just neuroplasticity, "
3301.87,but recovery of muscle and other tissues 
3304.346,"that are taxed during physical exercise, "
3307.601,"if you do train in phase two, "
3310.26,"I highly recommend, highly recommend "
3312.197,"that you start doing some NSDR activity after you train, "
3316.18,"within an hour or two, "
3317.3,because that will allow you to taper down and relax 
3319.68,so that you can get into the next phase we're going 
3321.65,"to talk about, which is phase three. "
3323.71,Phase three of the 
24-hour,schedule runs 
3327.03,from about 
16,to 
24,hours after waking. 
3331.31,"During that period of time, "
3332.925,there are few things 
3334.01,"that are going to support being in a state of mind, "
3336.595,state of body that are going to allow neuroplasticity 
3340.91,"to occur, that are going to allow the rewiring "
3343.31,that you've triggered during the waking part of the day 
3345.88,to actually take place. 
3347.266,"Those things are very low to no light, "
3350.655,meaning keeping your environment very dark 
3353.39,"or very, very dim. "
3354.586,I don't think it's necessary to sleep in a room 
3357.62,that's complete blackness. 
3359.069,"I think that's a little bit overkill, "
3361.235,but for most people keeping the room dark 
3363.836,and keeping the room temperature low is very beneficial 
3367.92,for getting and staying in deep sleep. 
3370.965,The body has to drop by about 
1,to 
3,degrees 
3374.08,"in order to get into sleep and stay asleep, "
3376.77,"so low light, low temperature environment, "
3379.55,you can always pile on blankets of course 
3381.38,"if you don't want to be cold at night, "
3383.2,"you want to be warm enough, "
3384.37,but you want your environment to be cold. 
3386.5,"Typically people aren't eating in the middle of the night, "
3389.217,although one thing that can be useful is to make sure 
3392.43,that you're at least well-fed enough 
3394.72,when you head into this third phase of every 
24-hour,day 
3398.1,that you're not awake because you're hungry. 
3400.56,A lot of people recommend putting a gap 
3402.65,between your final bite of food 
3404.01,and when you got to sleep at night. 
3405.46,Some people say that gap should be 
4,"hours, "
3407.51,other people say 
2,"hours, "
3409.35,"if you're me, I generally have something, I don't know, "
3411.47,within 
2,hours or 
90,"minutes of going to sleep, "
3414.19,"but it's not a big meal, but that's just me, "
3415.32,and I fall asleep and stay asleep fine with that. 
3417.591,You have to experiment for yourself. 
3419.494,I've talked about supplements 
3421.48,"that can support sleep in previous episode of the podcast, "
3424.13,"things like magnesium threonate, "
3425.86,"or magnesium bisglycinate, "
3427.5,"things like theonine, apigenin. "
3429.97,"If you'd like to read more about those, "
3431.67,we actually have a newsletter 
3432.97,that I'll just quickly refer you to 
3434.46,"this is the Huberman Lab Neural Network Newsletter, "
3437.63,"you can sign up for it by going to hubermanlab.com, "
3440.01,"it's very easy to find, "
3441.34,"but even if you don't sign up, "
3443.38,you can go to the toolkit for sleep that's listed there 
3446.41,"and that tool kit is not just supplements, "
3448.21,"that tool kit is a number of different things, "
3449.98,both behavioral and supplement-based 
3452.8,"and nutrition-based, et cetera, "
3454.44,that can allow you to get in to sleep 
3457.12,and to stay asleep more readily. 
3458.71,"It's totally zero cost, "
3459.82,you can find that again at hubermanlab.com. 
3461.88,"So things like low light, low temperature, "
3463.535,"the supplements I mentioned, "
3464.869,"adjusting your eating schedule appropriately, "
3467.263,obviously not drinking caffeine in the middle of the night 
3470.13,"or too close to bed, "
3471.03,that's going to be critical. 
3471.94,"In fact, ideally you wouldn't ingest any caffeine "
3474.98,"in phase two of the day, "
3476.66,so that you could get into this deeper state of rest 
3479.003,in which habit formation and neural plasticity can occur. 
3484.42,What if you wake up? 
3485.85,The way I've cast phase three is 
3487.69,"that you're supposed to be in this deep slumber, "
3489.73,"you're not supposed to wake up at all, "
3491.42,you're supposed to be in low light 
3492.65,and your brain is rewiring 
3493.84,"and those habits are getting consolidated, et cetera. "
3496.74,"Well, if you're like me, "
3497.803,you probably get up once in the middle of the night. 
3499.59,Maybe go use the restroom. 
3500.66,"Perfectly normal, perfectly normal, "
3502.39,but a lot of people have trouble falling back asleep. 
3504.473,Very important if you get up in the middle of the night 
3506.9,to use a minimum of light 
3508.16,"in order to navigate your surroundings, "
3509.68,"just as much as you need in order to safely do so, "
3512.23,"because light inhibits hormone melatonin, "
3515.236,can make it very hard to fall back to sleep 
3517.19,if you inhibit melatonin. 
3518.87,The effects of light inhibiting melatonin 
3520.186,are actually very potent. 
3521.6,"It happens very, very quickly, "
3523.2,so try and keep the lights low. 
3524.63,"And you have trouble falling back asleep, "
3527.44,that's when you might also want to use something 
3529.58,"like a Reverie app, "
3530.713,they have a sleep script there 
3532.36,that can hopefully help you get back to sleep. 
3534.49,"Or something like NSDR, "
3535.89,you can find NSDR scripts on YouTube. 
3537.93,These are zero cost. 
3539.26,You can look up one 
3540.093,that I particularly like is NSDR Madefor. 
3542.34,"It's a company I'm associated with, "
3544.04,"but the NSDR is completely zero cost, "
3546.35,"and there are other things, "
3547.67,"like Yoga Nidra, which you can find scripts for elsewhere. "
3550.32,"Again, all of these habits or these behaviors, "
3553.04,"these do's and don'ts around phase three, "
3554.81,themselves might be habits 
3557.37,that you're trying to create for yourself. 
3559.58,"But again, phase three is really about making sure "
3561.84,that whatever limbic friction you've been able 
3564.14,to override in phase one 
3565.68,"and trigger some new habit, right? "
3567.35,Forcing yourself to write 
3569.87,or forcing yourself to study 
3571.09,or forcing yourself to exercise 
3572.51,during that high limbic friction state. 
3574.708,"And then whatever things you've been doing in phase two, "
3577.2,which are habits 
3578.11,that hopefully have moved a little bit further 
3579.72,along the continuum of newly-formed 
3582.18,"versus all the way to reflexive, "
3583.712,or things that take less limbic friction in in order to do. 
3586.376,Phase three is when all of that gets really locked 
3589.62,into the nervous system 
3590.5,"through those Hebbian mechanisms, "
3592.25,"like NMDA receptors, et cetera, "
3594.1,that I talked about before. 
3595.1,"Again, neuroplasticity is the basis of habit formation "
3598.74,and neuroplasticity and the rewiring of neural circuits 
3601.24,happens in these states of deep sleep. 
3602.81,"So if you're not obeying this phase three, "
3606.411,"if you're not giving phase three the material it needs, "
3610.36,"and you're and you're not avoiding the certain things, "
3612.07,like caffeine and bright light and stress during phase 
"3,",
3616.21,you're simply not going to be able to build those habits 
3618.824,that you've been working so hard to trigger in phase one 
3621.737,and phase two of the day. 
3624.2,"Again, these are things "
3625.57,that I've talked about previous episodes of the podcast 
3628.24,"and elsewhere, but really this is about habit formation. "
3631.718,And the whole reason 
3633.163,for placing particular types of behaviors 
3635.586,at particular phases of the day is to set a framework 
3639.562,for that task-bracketing. 
3641.78,"Again, task-bracketing "
3643.47,and the circuits of the basal ganglia 
3645.52,indicate that it's not just the neural circuits 
3648.19,"that are engaged by the task itself, "
3651.34,but the neural circuits that are engaged before 
3654.32,and after that task execution. 
3657.6,That's what gets consolidated. 
3659.64,"So when you do things that particular phases of the day, "
3662.647,"under particular conditions of neurochemistry, "
3665.93,what you're doing is 
3666.763,you're giving the brain a very predictable set of sequences 
3669.6,"that during sleep it can start to put into your hard drive, "
3673.7,if you will. 
3674.533,"It can really program it into your nervous system, "
3676.57,"so that within a short period of time, "
3678.81,hopefully within 
18,or maybe even 
6,days 
3682.25,"or who knows? Maybe even fewer days, "
3684.19,"you'll find that executing those behaviors is very, "
3687.25,very straightforward for you 
3688.49,and that you won't have to feel so much limbic friction 
3692.01,or override so much limbic friction. 
3694.15,"Some of you are probably asking, okay, "
3696.156,"if I perform a particular habit during phase one, "
3700.273,"and then I do other habits during phase two, "
3702.96,and I eventually get to the point 
3704.46,where I'm engaging in those habits 
3706.37,"in a pretty effortless way, "
3708.874,do I keep them in the same phase of the day? 
3711.58,"And the good news is, the literature says it doesn't matter. "
3714.58,"And in fact, "
3715.413,moving that particular habit around somewhat randomly 
3718.79,can actually be beneficial to you 
3720.24,because actually moving it from one time a day 
3722.59,to the other is that context independence 
3725.24,that we really are seeking. 
3727.113,By being able to do the same thing that we want to do 
3731.03,regardless of time of day or circumstances 
3733.91,that's how we know 
3734.86,"that we've achieved a real habit formation, "
3737.18,that's how we know that the habit has been moved 
3739.81,into certain components of our neural circuity 
3741.89,that just allow us to do it 
3743.19,what seems like reflexively. 
3744.56,Although earlier I pointed out 
3745.68,that these aren't reflexes in the traditional sense. 
3748.477,"The reason for that is that this brain area, "
3752.034,"the hippocampus, that many of you know is associated "
3754.96,"with learning and memory, "
3755.96,is not actually where memories are stored. 
3758.34,"The hippocampus is where memories are formed, "
3760.74,"it's where procedures, like we talked about before, "
3763.21,procedural memory of how you're going 
3764.66,"to execute a particular sequence, "
3766.21,where that's maintained. 
3767.74,"So like if we use the recipe model, "
3769.61,that's where the recipe is maintained 
3771.55,until you know how to cook that dish 
3773.72,and then the procedural memory literally migrates off 
3777.939,"into a different set of neural circuits, "
3780.24,which are the neural circuits of the neocortex 
3782.5,"where we have maps of sensory experience, "
3785.58,"maps of all kinds experiences, "
3788.156,including motor maps of how to execute things. 
3790.46,"So we use one part of the brain to learn something, "
3793.0,"but then that information, "
3794.48,"in the form of the electrical activity of neurons, "
3796.93,is passed off to a different brain area. 
3800.09,"Now, the neurons themselves don't move "
3801.96,"from the hippocampus to the cortex, "
3803.45,that doesn't happen. 
3804.283,"What happens is the signals, "
3806.35,"the sequence of electrical firing, "
3808.06,much like a script for a movie 
3811.2,or the notes on a sheet of paper 
3813.791,for a particular musical piece 
3816.041,is transferred off to a different brain area. 
3818.644,"So, that whole process "
3820.97,"of really leaning into something that's hard, "
3822.767,"and then it becoming easier, "
3824.09,and then eventually that things becoming more 
3825.79,or less reflexive involves a migration 
3828.1,of the information in the brain. 
3829.743,And once it's migrated out 
3831.651,"to a different location in the brain, "
3833.73,at that point it's achieved context-independence. 
3837.0,"It doesn't have to be bracketed by, you know, "
3840.51,your caffeine and your lunch. 
3842.1,It doesn't have to occur immediately 
3845.0,"after your afternoon NSDR, "
3846.81,"but before your four O'clock meeting on Zoom, "
3849.78,or something of that sort. 
3851.1,So all this is to say 
3853.36,"that once something has become reflexive, "
3855.358,you should play with it a little bit about time of day. 
3858.17,"If you want to keep it in the same phase of day, great. "
3860.866,But if you one day decide 
3862.736,"you're going to exercise in the afternoon, "
3864.457,the next day you decide 
3865.95,"you're going to exercise in the morning, "
3866.98,"and that's the habit that you're concerned with, "
3869.5,that's terrific. 
3870.333,"If you're able to do that, that means "
3871.166,that it's truly achieved context-independence. 
3872.84,It means that you have officially formed that habit. 
3875.4,"And as I mentioned earlier, "
3876.909,"much earlier at the beginning of the episode, "
3879.258,the strength of a habit is dictated by 
3881.88,"how much limbic friction, that was one, "
3885.282,and how much context dependence there is. 
3888.65,So when it doesn't take much activation energy 
3891.31,to get into the execution of that habit 
3893.47,"and you can do it in any context, well, "
3895.89,then you have formed a habit. 
3897.558,"We really can't have a discussion about learning anything, "
3899.887,"habits or otherwise, "
3901.811,unless we talk about reward prediction error. 
3904.931,Reward prediction error is associated 
3907.8,"with the molecule dopamine, "
3909.28,although I should say there are other neurochemicals 
3911.56,in our brain and body 
3912.42,that are also related to reward prediction error. 
3915.436,"But reward prediction error is a very good system, "
3920.197,"or I should say, a lens through which to think about, "
3922.92,whether or not we should reward ourselves 
3925.26,for performing a given habit. 
3927.68,And this is a much larger discussion 
3929.29,that actually relates to things like parenting 
3931.33,and self-regulation. 
3932.72,"You know, should we reward kids just for effort? "
3935.174,Should we reward ourselves just for effort? 
3937.86,What should we reward? 
3938.78,How much should we reward ourselves? 
3940.14,When should we withdraw reward? 
3941.8,Should we use punishment? 
3942.93,These kinds of things. 
3943.763,This is a vast literature. 
3944.776,"We don't have time to go into all the details, "
3947.15,but the notion of reward prediction error is so powerful 
3951.246,that it can predict most 
3953.41,"if not all forms of learning, including habit formation. "
3956.63,And you can deploy or use particular features 
3959.53,of reward prediction error 
3961.09,if you would like to reinforce 
3963.28,or accelerate the formation of certain habits. 
3967.22,"So, reward prediction error, quite simply, is "
3971.124,"if you expect a reward and the reward comes, "
3975.137,a particular behavior that was associated 
3978.01,with generating that reward is more likely 
3980.35,to occur again. 
3981.51,That's pretty straight forward. 
3983.38,"However, the amount of reward, "
3986.68,"in the form of this molecule dopamine, "
3989.12,that you will experience is even greater 
3991.96,if a reward arrives that's unexpected. Okay. 
3997.36,So let me repeat that again. 
3998.84,"If I think that something's coming that's going to be great, "
4003.532,"let's say I lean into a habit, "
4006.23,"I manage to override my limbic friction, "
4008.36,and I'm doing my 
45,minutes of writing in the morning 
4011.27,with no phone and no internet 
4012.77,"and I'm getting toward the end, "
4013.603,"and I'm anticipating how I'm actually doing this, "
4015.283,"this is great, I did it, "
4016.59,"I'm feeling really, really good. "
4018.47,"I finish, I definitely will receive a dopamine reward, "
4023.35,"I'll make my own dopamine reward, "
4024.61,that's where it comes from. 
4025.443,"Remember, this is all internal. "
4027.069,"However, I will also receive a dopamine reward "
4030.24,if unexpectedly something positive happens. 
4034.66,And typically if something unexpected 
4037.68,"but positive happens, "
4039.05,the amount of dopamine reward 
4040.67,that we get is actually much greater 
4042.25,than in any other conditions. 
4044.36,"However, it's hard to surprise yourself "
4046.59,about a behavior that you're deliberately engaging in. 
4049.16,So that becomes a bit of a tricky one. 
4052.2,Reward prediction error also says 
4054.38,that if we expect a reward and the reward doesn't come 
4059.8,that the pattern of dopamine release 
4061.59,will follow a particular contour 
4063.99,and that contour is very important. 
4065.55,Here's how it goes. 
4066.866,Let's say that I'm writing 
4070.14,and I'm about 
30,or 
45,"minutes in, "
4072.72,"I'm thinking, ""Ah, this is great."" "
4074.638,"""I'm actually, I managed to do this"" "
4076.073,"""I'm succeeding in executing the behaviors"" "
4078.657,"""that I need to in order to perform this habit."" "
4081.657,"""I'm overriding limbic friction."" "
4083.696,Just that series of thoughts will start 
4086.43,to generate the dopamine release within my brain and body. 
4089.72,"However, if at the "
15,minute mark the phone rings 
4094.67,and I pick up the phone 
4096.28,"or I break my own protocol, I break my own self-discipline "
4100.38,and I go on and check social media 
4102.64,"or I do something that takes me out of that, "
4105.31,what's going to happen is 
4107.32,that my level of dopamine is actually going 
4110.267,"to drop below the baseline, "
4111.84,meaning below the level of dopamine I had 
4114.06,before I even started the habit execution. Okay? 
4118.23,"So what this is, is this system that predicts whether "
4121.482,or not rewards are going to come. 
4123.886,"When we think a reward is going to come, "
4126.57,it starts to actually arrive earlier 
4128.68,in the form of dopamine release. 
4130.04,This is the feeling 
4131.56,that we experience as positive anticipation. 
4135.03,"You tell a kid, "
4135.863,"""Hey, we're going to go to the amusement park."" Or "
4137.527,"""We're going to go get ice cream."" "
4139.02,"They haven't had the ice cream yet, "
4140.3,"they're not at the amusement park, "
4141.61,"but they're excited, the dopamine release comes earlier. "
4144.58,Okay? They get to the amusement park 
4146.07,"or they get the ice cream, "
4147.04,they will also have some dopamine release 
4149.39,associated with that. 
4150.443,"But most of it, believe it or not, "
4152.51,came in the form of the anticipation. 
4154.53,And dopamine has some qualities 
4155.93,that make the actual ice cream 
4157.43,and the actual amusement park experience more pleasurable 
4160.44,than it would be had that dopamine release not happened. 
4164.04,"Now of course, the other way to do is to surprise a kid. "
4166.1,"You tell them, "
4166.933,"""Listen, we're going to the class that you absolutely hate."" "
4170.3,"Or ""We're going to go see the person"" "
4171.767,"""that you absolutely despise."" "
4173.14,And then you drive them to the amusement park 
4174.53,that's the big release of dopamine. 
4177.1,But reward prediction error also says 
4179.38,"that if you tell the kid, or yourself, "
4181.677,"""Okay, we're headed to the amusement park."" "
4183.027,"""We're going to get some ice cream."" "
4184.32,"They're really, really excited. "
4185.33,"And then you get there and it's closed, "
4187.55,"or they're not letting any more people in, "
4189.34,well then the dopamine level drops way below what it was 
4192.4,before you told them that you were headed there. Okay? 
4194.53,I've given a number of different examples 
4195.83,that hopefully make this clear. 
4197.17,Reward prediction error governs virtually all aspects 
4200.805,of effort and all aspects of learning. 
4204.19,Why? Because when dopamine is released in the brain 
4206.9,"and body, the neural circuits of our brain and body change. "
4210.45,There's a state change. 
4212.62,"Our over level, excuse me, our overall level of energy, "
4216.44,but also the sorts of sensory events 
4218.61,that we're paying attention to changes 
4220.5,when there's a lot of dopamine in our system. 
4223.46,Now you can leverage this for habit formation. 
4226.79,Think back to task bracketing. 
4228.835,Think back to limbic friction. 
4231.515,If you are considering adopting a new habit 
4235.28,"or if you are trying to break a habit, "
4237.06,"something we haven't talked too much about, "
4238.47,"but we will in a moment, it's very useful "
4241.97,to think not just about the procedural aspects 
4244.98,"of what you're going to do, "
4246.33,but also think about the events that precede 
4249.63,"and follow that particular habit, "
4252.95,"and the execution, or at least the effort "
4255.68,to execute that habit. 
4257.385,What you're doing is you're casting a kind of a spotlight 
4260.63,"around a bin of time, or a set of events, "
4263.85,for which dopamine can be associated. 
4266.03,What does this look like in the practical sense? 
4268.12,"Well again, "
4268.953,"I'll just try and use very simple concrete examples, "
4271.09,but this could carry over to anything. 
4272.74,Let's say I were somebody who has a hard time getting in 
4276.57,that 
30,to 
60,minutes 
4278.3,of zone II cardiovascular exercise mid-morning. 
4281.65,This is actually an issue for me. 
4282.96,I much prefer to do resistance exercise 
4284.81,"than cardiovascular exercise, "
4286.07,"although once I do it, I always feel much better "
4288.71,that I've done it. 
4291.163,What I should do is positively anticipate the onset 
4297.0,and the offset of that session. Right? 
4299.87,"So thinking about leaning into the effort, "
4303.137,"going out and doing that zone II cardio session, "
4306.29,and I should think about how I'm going to feel after. 
4308.38,"So, not just thinking about "
4309.27,"how great I'm going to feel after, "
4311.901,but also thinking about how hard it's going to be 
4314.41,"at the beginning, "
4315.243,and then trying to reward myself subjectively 
4317.73,for the entire experience. 
4319.06,"In other words, start rewarding task-bracketing "
4321.84,in addition to rewarding the execution of the habit itself. 
4326.55,"Now some of you might be saying, "
4327.527,"""Well, wait this is all self-talk."" "
4329.127,"""This is just positive self-talk."" "
4330.7,"But it's not positive self-talk, it's not saying, you know, "
4334.277,"""I feel so great about doing something"" "
4335.817,"""that I actually hate."" "
4336.65,"You can't lie to yourself, "
4337.59,"or you're welcome to lie to yourself, "
4339.08,"but the neuroscience literature, "
4340.63,"the literature of growth mindset, "
4342.12,all the literature basically of mindset 
4344.08,"speaks to the fact that when you lie to yourself, "
4346.17,"you know you're lying, "
4347.26,and you actually set up the opposite of a reward system. 
4350.38,"So, you have to be brutally honest with yourself "
4352.298,"that, for instance, "
4353.798,"""I don't like initiating this cardiovascular exercise"" "
4357.137,"""but I do like the fact that I've done it"" "
4358.737,"""after I've done it."" "
4359.83,So what you are doing is 
4361.04,you are applying reward prediction error 
4363.172,to the entire sequence of things 
4365.44,"that's involved in getting into the habit execution, "
4368.695,"getting through the habit execution, "
4371.05,and getting out of the habit of execution. 
4373.15,How do you do this? 
4374.19,"Well, I take us back "
4375.53,to our procedural memory visualization exercises 
4379.14,we talked about earlier. 
4380.33,"When I talked about it in that context, "
4382.07,I talked about walking through mentally the series of steps 
4385.92,that's required to perform a particular habit. 
4387.81,"So in the case of the zone II cardio thing it would be, "
4390.437,"""Okay up and put on my shoes,"" "
4391.527,"""then I'm going to head out the door,"" "
4392.547,"""then I'm going to drive up the road."" "
4393.89,"There is a particular canyon near here that, "
4395.57,"if I'm going to run, "
4396.47,"I happen to like running, or I don't hate running enough "
4399.25,that I tend to do it. 
4400.56,"Going through that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera. "
4403.31,"That's great, but even better "
4405.57,would be to broaden the time bin 
4407.496,and start to positively anticipate the period headed 
4410.628,"into the habit, so even before you put on your shoes. "
4415.06,"The fact that you are successfully placing the habit in, "
4419.16,"in this case, phase one of the day "
4422.21,and that afterwards I'm going 
4424.54,"to feel a particular set of positive benefits, "
4426.93,"elevated mood, et cetera. "
4428.38,"I like being hungry and quickly after I exercise I'm hungry, "
4431.0,"so I like being hungry because I like eating, "
4432.83,so there's a whole set of things 
4434.3,that link up with one another. 
4435.88,So I'm not just thinking about habit execution 
4437.61,"as this isolated little set of events, "
4439.69,"or this little time bin, "
4441.27,"but rather, I'm drawing a larger envelope around it "
4444.17,and starting to positively associate dopamine reward 
4446.7,with that larger envelope. 
4448.69,"And for those of you that are thinking, "
4449.817,"""Well, this is just a psychological trick."" "
4451.61,"You know, you're kind of like, "
4453.363,"""This is sort of like lying to yourself."" "
4454.48,It's not because you're not actually contradicting the fact 
4457.99,that some of this is unpleasant. 
4459.8,What you're doing is 
4460.633,"you're taking this entire series of events, "
4462.36,"what I'm calling this kind of time envelope, "
4463.97,and you're associating it with a particular reward 
4466.59,"that comes later, "
4467.423,"which for me would be the feeling that, you know, "
4470.14,that I've completed this. 
4471.21,Right? Because for me that's usually a good feeling. 
4473.26,"So reward prediction error is beautiful, "
4475.62,not just because it's a sort of math of anticipation 
4479.01,"and reward, or a math of anticipation "
4481.18,"and disappointment, "
4482.42,it's beautiful because you can stretch out 
4485.43,or make more narrow the time bins 
4487.64,in which reward prediction error works. 
4490.12,Reward prediction error is the way 
4491.69,in which people navigate four year degrees. 
4494.27,"Right? I mean, you go, sure, final exam "
4496.63,"to final exam, et cetera. "
4497.66,"But ultimately, there's a big payoff at the end "
4499.53,and it's all basically for that big payoff. 
4502.052,"And of course, I understand that it's the journey, "
4504.15,"not the destination, but let's face it, "
4505.75,for a lot of us goals 
4507.16,and habits are about achieving some sort of destination. 
4510.29,"In the case of zone II cardio, "
4511.57,"for me it's about trying to stay alive for as long as I can, "
4514.674,"as long as I can with vitality, that is. "
4517.61,"And it's also the fact that if I'm doing that, "
4520.14,I get to eat the foods that I like. 
4522.62,"I tend to be able to eat more, "
4523.95,"which I happen to really enjoy eating, "
4525.35,so much so that I'd like it just as an activity. 
4527.65,So basically what you're trying to do 
4529.52,is not restrict your thinking to just the habit 
4532.28,"that you're trying to form, but rather, "
4534.07,to grab ahold of the timing before 
4536.86,and after that particular habit 
4538.87,and start to positively associate reward mechanisms 
4541.55,in your brain with that entire time bin. 
4544.07,This is a very useful and very powerful tool 
4546.7,in order to form habits. 
4548.36,And I should say that it's not something 
4550.53,that comes naturally to most people. 
4552.06,"In fact, even as I describe it, "
4553.52,"you might find it's still a little bit abstract, "
4555.57,"but what I encourage you to do, "
4557.08,"if you are finding it to be a little bit vague, "
4559.34,"would be to pick the habit that you want to form, "
4561.405,write down or think about very concretely 
4564.096,what is the sequence of steps involved 
4566.27,"in the execution of that habit, "
4568.03,and then write down or think about 
4570.07,what is the sequence of events 
4571.62,"that need to precede that habit, "
4573.52,maybe the immediate 
10,or 
15,"minutes before, "
4576.11,as well as the immediate sequence of events 
4578.229,"and/or feelings that will occur after that habit, "
4580.838,and then call the whole thing a habit execution. 
4584.87,The whole thing a effort to engage in that particular habit. 
4589.1,"And in doing that, and in positively associating "
4592.07,with the idea that you're going 
4593.47,"to complete that entire sequence, "
4595.44,you will engage reward prediction error 
4597.52,in the proper way that the dopamine surge 
4599.489,can lend itself towards motivation. 
4601.91,"Because ultimately, dopamine is not about feeling good, "
4605.5,it's about feeling motivated. 
4606.96,This is something 
4607.793,"that I've talked about numerous times before, "
4609.41,"but dopamine, contrary to popular belief, "
4611.79,"is not a reward molecule, "
4613.522,so much as it is a molecule of motivation and drive. 
4617.016,And the natural consequence 
4619.12,"of doing the exercise I just described, "
4621.27,"of writing things out that precede, "
4623.259,"are involved in the immediate execution of the habit, "
4625.67,"and follow the habit, "
4626.902,will allow you to experience an increase in energy 
4631.09,and thereby an increase in likelihood 
4633.49,that you're going to engage 
4634.53,in that entire sequence of events. 
4636.48,"And the reason for that is that dopamine gives us energy, "
4638.607,"and the reason for that is that the molecule epinephrine, "
4641.577,"adrenaline, is actually manufactured from dopamine. "
4644.87,"Biochemically, it comes from dopamine. "
4647.07,"So, dopamine is powerful "
4648.73,and you can access more dopamine 
4650.785,around even habits that you haven't yet formed 
4654.044,by taking this broader time envelope 
4656.44,and task-bracketing that specific task execution 
4659.68,or habit execution. 
4661.33,"Way back at the beginning of the episode, "
4663.02,In promised you that I would deliver two programs 
4665.603,that are geared towards habit formation. 
4669.33,And I promised that I would give you ways 
4671.37,in which you could gauge whether 
4672.7,"or not certain habits had moved from high effort, "
4676.051,"what I call high limbic friction, to reflexive. "
4679.65,And we talked about a number of way to gauge that. 
4682.485,"In researching this episode, "
4684.048,I found a tremendous number of different systems 
4687.12,for habit formation. 
4688.53,It's really amazing how much is out there. 
4690.46,"There, one says "
60,"days to this, "
4692.24,or 
21,"days to that, or "
18,days to this. 
4694.6,"I mean, "
4695.597,it's just rampant in the popular psychology literature 
4697.947,and in the self-help literature. 
4701.2,I want to spell out a particular system 
4703.44,that I think could be very useful 
4705.1,to most if not all people 
4707.53,"that's rooted in the biology of habit formation, "
4711.13,"rooted in the psychology of habit formation, "
4713.21,"and that is entirely compatible with that phase one, "
4715.78,"phase two, phase three type program "
4717.38,"that I talked about earlier, "
4719.0,but encompasses a bit of a longer time scale 
4721.802,"and really arrives at a kind of a system, if you will, "
4725.698,for how to build in habits 
4728.8,and then to test whether or not those habits 
4731.1,have really stuck 
4732.45,and whether or not they're likely to stick going forward. 
4735.12,"And so this, at least for the sake of this example, "
4738.46,a 
21,day system. 
4739.67,I picked 
21,days because that seems to be the average 
4742.73,or most typical system for engaging neuroplasticity 
4746.427,as it relates to the formation of new habits. 
4748.9,This 
21,"day system, actually, "
4750.33,is one that someone I know very well uses 
4751.864,and has used for a very long time. 
4753.563,"They actually, their kids use it as well. "
4756.2,And it has a certain elegance to it 
4757.74,and I think as I describe it that elegance 
4760.65,will begin to reveal itself. 
4762.5,So basically what this involves is you set out 
4766.18,to perform 
6,new habits per day 
4770.242,across the course of 
21,days. 
4772.77,Why 
6,and why 
21?,
4774.29,"Well, we'll talk about that in a moment. "
4776.11,"But the idea is, you write down "
6,things 
4778.247,that you would like to do every day for 
21,days. 
4781.336,What phase of the day those things fall into? 
4784.3,"Well, that will depend on what they are "
4785.81,"and how they relate to those earlier phase one, "
4787.79,"phase two, phase three, but for now, "
4789.57,
21,"days, "
6,"things per day. However, "
4791.598,the expectation is that you'll only complete 
4,
4795.508,to 
5,of those each day. Okay? 
4798.53,"So built into this is a kind of permission to fail, "
4801.57,"but it's not failure, "
4802.8,because it turns out that this approach 
4806.5,to forming habits is based 
4808.33,not so much on the specific habits 
4810.77,"that you're trying to form, "
4812.25,but the habit of performing habits. Right? 
4815.26,It's the habit of doing a certain number of things per day. 
4819.532,"So, you set out to perform "
6.,
4821.76,"Now, another reason for not necessarily performing all "
6,is 
4824.87,that some activities probably 
4826.57,shouldn't be performed each day. 
4828.45,"For instance, in my case, if I were to weight train "
4831.64,"or even run every day, I'm of the sort, "
4834.13,or my biology is of the sort that I don't recover so well. 
4837.55,"So I wouldn't want to do resistance training every day, "
4840.18,but I might want to do it 
4,"days a week, for instance. "
4842.075,So by having 
6,"things in that list, "
4844.53,you could shuffle out that particular activity 
4847.3,"on particular days of the week, "
4848.57,and simply do 
4,or 
5,other activities. 
4851.29,So 
21,"days, you list out "
4,to 
5,things. 
4853.26,"So it might be zone II cardio, resistance training, "
4855.66,"sunlight viewing, writing could be journaling, "
4859.794,"it could be learning a language, mathematics. "
4862.57,Again this is going to vary 
4863.61,depending on your particular goal 
4865.077,and the habits that you're trying to create. 
4866.937,But no more than six 
4868.685,and the expectation is 
4869.92,that you're not going to perform more than 
4,to 
5.,
4872.17,"If you miss a day, meaning you don't perform "
4,to 
5,"things, "
4876.56,there is no punishment. 
4879.27,And in fact it's important that you don't actually try 
4883.2,"and do what, in the literature, "
4884.27,"is called a habit slip compensation, "
4886.49,which is just fancy psychological language 
4889.09,for if you screw up and you don't get all 
4,or 
5,"in one day, "
4894.17,you don't do 
8,the next day in order to compensate. 
4897.275,This actually brings me back to an example I had 
4901.217,from graduate school. 
4902.383,I remember when I started graduate school 
4903.768,"feeling very excited, but a little bit overwhelmed "
4905.49,by the amount of things that I had to do 
4906.946,"because I had to both do research, I was doing coursework, "
4909.83,"at the time graduate students stipends, "
4911.68,"and still now unfortunately, were depressingly low "
4915.32,so it was financially stressful. 
4916.62,There were a number of things happening 
4918.03,"and I remember a neurologist, this was at UC Berkeley, "
4921.106,"he was a really fantastic scientist and person, "
4923.56,"his name was Bob Knight, some of you may know him. "
4925.349,"I remember he, I went to him and I asked, you know, "
4927.567,"""What is the process by which someone"" "
4929.317,"""actually navigates graduate school successfully?"" "
4931.65,"And he said, ""Listen, you don't want to do anything"" "
4935.927,"""or engage in a routine in any way"" "
4938.567,"""that you can't keep up consistently"" "
4940.237,"""for at least five and ideally "
6,"days per week."" "
4943.23,"I thought, ""Oh, that's pretty good."" "
4944.27,"And he said, ""Every "
4,or 
5,"years"" "
4945.927,"""you might have to update that,"" "
4946.957,"""but you need to decide what you can do consistently,"" "
4949.137,"""what you can do every day or at least six days a week,"" "
4951.907,"""or "
5,"days a week."" "
4953.08,And that was very very useful to me 
4955.11,"and it fits well with this notion of habit slips, "
4957.89,that if you happen to screw up and not be able to engage 
4961.67,in whatever habits you're trying to learn 
4963.79,"for whatever reason, that the next day, "
4965.48,"you just get right back on on the on the horse, so to speak. "
4969.26,"However, there's a really interesting feature "
4971.77,from the neuroscience literature 
4973.62,and from the psychology that says 
4975.44,that chunking this 
21,days into 
2,day bins 
4978.94,"can be very, very useful. "
4980.9,While it is true that the unit of the day 
4982.91,"that our cells use is a circadian one, a "
24-hour,"clock, "
4986.837,there does seem to be something powerful 
4989.2,"about engaging in particular habits, "
4991.11,"in a particular sequence, for two days in a row, "
4995.21,"and then resetting, so thinking, "
4996.697,"""Okay I can do this for a day"" "
4998.727,"""and if I can do it for a day,"" "
4999.627,"""I can probably do it for "
2,"days."" "
5000.91,And then resetting. So every 
2,days you're resetting. 
5003.73,So you're kind of chunking 
21,days 
5006.21,into a series of 
2,"day bins, in which you are trying "
5008.171,to perform 
4,to 
5,new habits 
5010.59,and then completing that 
21,days. 
5013.345,"Now, everything I've described about this "
21-day,program 
5016.14,with 
6,things that you're trying to do with new habits 
5018.69,and only performing 
4,to 
5,"and not compensating, et cetera. "
5022.15,"There's nothing neuroscientifically unique about it, "
5025.69,except for the fact that it's not just 
21,"days, "
5029.691,broken up into two day chunks. 
5032.39,After 
21,"days, you stop engaging "
5035.504,in this 
21-day,deliberate 
4,to 
5,"things per day, "
5040.05,"tight schedule, and you simply go into autopilot. "
5044.1,You ask yourself how many of those particular habits 
5047.56,that I was deliberately trying to learn 
5049.7,in the previous 
21,days are automatically incorporated 
5053.76,into my schedule? 
5054.593,How many of them am I naturally doing? 
5056.71,"In other words, every "
21,days you don't update 
5059.25,and start adding new habits. 
5061.1,You simply try and maintain the ones 
5062.89,that you built in that first 
21,days. 
5065.05,And this I think is extremely important 
5067.2,"because in all the habit literature that I could find, "
5070.213,"sure, there was a lot of psychological data "
5073.27,"and neuroscience data, behavioral science data "
5075.89,"around here's how you form a habit, "
5077.44,here's how you break a habit. 
5078.93,There was even some kind of test for whether 
5081.61,"or not a habit had really achieved context independence, "
5085.1,whether or not it was a strongly formed habit. 
5087.86,"But there wasn't a lot of information, "
5089.75,"at least by my search, "
5091.138,"of what to do once you've formed a habit, "
5093.622,and how to evaluate whether 
5095.24,or not that habit is likely to persist long into the future. 
5099.426,"So here's the idea, you set out these "
6,things 
5104.26,"that you would like to learn, "
5105.71,"or that you would like to acquire in your life, "
5107.68,"these habits, you only expect "
5110.212,that you're going to perform 
4,or 
5,"each day, "
5111.72,you do that for 
21,days. 
5113.33,"Again, if you miss a day, "
5114.307,you just hop right back on the next day. 
5116.03,"However, you should think about the functional units "
5119.0,within this 
21,day period as 
2,days. 
5121.923,You can try and nail 
4,to 
5,of these things for 
2,days. 
5125.41,If you happen to get all 
"6,","great, "
5126.96,but that's not necessarily required. 
5129.15,So you can do it for 
2,days then reset 
2,"days, "
5131.06,then reset 
2,"days, and then in the next "
21,"days, "
5133.83,"you're not trying to acquire any new habits, "
5135.81,you're not going to throw in 
6,more habits 
5138.01,"that you want to learn, you're simply going to assess "
5140.222,"how well, how deeply, you rewired your nervous system "
5143.492,to be able to perform those 
6,habits 
5146.223,of the previous 
21,days. 
5148.74,"And this is extremely useful, I believe, "
5150.73,because it will allow you to asses whether 
5153.257,"or not you can indeed make room, "
5155.46,"if you even have room, I should say, for more habits. "
5159.527,Many people are trying to cram so many new behaviors 
5162.35,"into their nervous system, that they don't stand a chance "
5164.73,of learning all those behaviors. 
5166.15,"What you may find, "
5167.09,is that you kept up 
2,of those things very consistently 
5170.11,throughout the 
21,days. 
5171.29,"And perhaps there was one of them that you did sporadically, "
5174.03,and that there were 
3,"others that, frankly, "
5177.31,you didn't manage to execute. 
5178.72,"You may also be one of these people, one of these mutants, "
5181.905,that sets out to do 
6,new things per day for 
21,days 
5184.444,and performs every single one of them. 
5186.474,"Terrific. More power to you. In that case, "
5188.483,for the following 
21,"days, let's see whether "
5192.02,or not you can continue to perform those very same 
6,things 
5194.94,every day for 
21,"days, and then, and only then, "
5197.111,would you want to add more habits in. 
5200.853,So you could repeat this 
21,"day process, you know, "
5203.54,
21,"days of new habit, "
21,days of testing those new habits 
5206.9,as to whether or not they're reflexive or not. 
5208.29,"You could do that forever, if you wanted. "
5210.865,But the idea is that this isn't something 
5212.89,that you're doing all year long. 
5214.65,It's that you're perhaps starting the new year 
5216.84,"or regardless of when you're listening to this, "
5218.74,you set out to make that 
21,day really the stimulus period 
5222.32,in which the habits get wired in 
5224.24,"and then the following month, "
5225.46,"and maybe even the following months, or periods of "
21,"days, "
5229.07,are really the kind of thermometer or the test bed 
5232.11,of how well you've embedded those particular habits. 
5235.56,And if indeed you want to continue to add new habits 
5238.58,or you find that certain habits that you weren't able 
5240.53,"to embed in your nervous system and make reflexive, "
5242.81,"you want to then bring those in, fantastic. "
5245.1,But it's only once you've achieved all those 
6,habits 
5247.65,"as reflexive, that you would move forward. "
5249.43,"And I think this sort of system, "
5251.077,while it could have been replaced 
5253.74,with many other different systems. 
5255.7,"Again, there's nothing holy about this system. "
5257.89,"But this particular system has a number of features, "
5260.75,"the lack of compensation for missed days, "
5263.37,the fact that it's a fairly high intensity program 
5266.08,for 
21,"days, but then you test yourself, "
5268.52,"a kind of competition test with yourself, if you will. "
5270.889,"Those features and the fact that habit slips, "
5274.443,missing of particular habits 
5276.66,and not doing all 
6,"is kind of built into the system, "
5279.01,I think makes it a very reasonable one. 
5281.24,It's very adaptable to the real world. 
5284.0,"And I think it's one that, provided you obey the phase one, "
5288.44,"phase two, phase three type system "
5290.08,"that we talked about earlier, "
5290.99,"you collapse these two programs with one another, "
5293.46,"which hopefully will be easy, "
5294.65,"based on the descriptions I've given. Well, if you do that, "
5297.267,and I think there's a very high probability 
5299.73,that the habits that you try and form 
5301.15,will achieve this context dependence 
5302.74,and that it will take progressively less limbic friction 
5305.31,to try and perform them. 
5306.48,"Thus far, we've almost exclusively been discussing "
5308.95,how to form habits. 
5310.65,But what about breaking habits? 
5312.37,Certainly many people out there would like to break habits 
5315.44,that they feel don't serve them well. 
5317.662,One of the challenges in breaking habits is 
5320.02,"that many habits occur very, very quickly "
5323.16,and so there isn't an opportunity to intervene 
5324.883,until the habit has already been initiated 
5327.778,and in some cases completed. 
5330.49,"Well, there are a couple of tools "
5332.23,that neuroscience and psychology tell us 
5334.86,can be very beneficial. 
5336.61,Some of those things are somewhat intuitive 
5339.011,and relate to what I call foundation practices. 
5341.846,Meaning things that set the overall tone 
5344.54,"in your body and brain, such that you would be less likely "
5347.545,to engage in a particular habit 
5349.763,"or that would raise your level of awareness, "
5352.396,both of your situation and to how you feel inside. 
5356.57,So things like stress reduction. 
5358.094,Things like getting good sleep. 
5359.72,Things like quality nutrition. 
5361.21,Things like having positive routines 
5363.33,arranged throughout your day. 
5364.78,"All of those, of course, will support you "
5367.033,in trying to break particular habits. 
5369.73,"And while that can be very useful, "
5371.35,it's admittedly very generic advice. 
5374.13,It doesn't point to any one specific protocol. 
5376.75,In order to identify a specific protocol 
5379.77,"that one could apply in order to break habits, "
5381.857,we have to look at the mirror image 
5384.043,of the sort of neuroplasticity 
5386.17,that we talked about at the beginning of the episode. 
5388.76,"At the beginning of the episode, "
5390.04,we talked about a form of neuroplasticity 
5391.72,"called long term potentiation, "
5393.51,involving the NMDA receptor. 
5395.606,"Just to refresh your memory a little bit, "
5397.354,it says that if a set of neurons is very electrically active 
5401.98,it's likely that those neurons will communicate 
5404.74,with themselves more easily 
5406.154,"because of changes in things like NMDA receptor activity, "
5410.32,"the recruitment of additional receptors, et cetera. "
5412.33,It's essentially a cellular and molecular explanation 
5415.38,"for how something goes from unlearned, "
5418.53,"to learned, to reflexive. "
5420.98,"Now, in order to break synapses, "
5423.58,or to break apart neural connections 
5425.62,"that are serving a habit that you don't want to engage in, "
5428.551,we need to engage the process called long term depression. 
5432.53,And long term depression has nothing to do 
5434.905,with a state of mental depression or a reduction in mood. 
5439.93,So I really want to be clear that 
5441.51,when I say depression in this context 
5443.89,"it has nothing to do with psychological depression, "
5445.97,it has nothing to do with mood. 
5447.91,It's simply called long term depression 
5450.18,because just as long term potentiation says 
5452.93,"if neuron A triggers the firing of neuron B, "
5455.85,"and it does so very robustly over and over and over again, "
5459.03,"then neuron A will not have to fire as intensely, "
5462.97,"or as frequently, in order to activate neuron B "
5466.05,in the future because they become potentiated. 
5468.52,Right? The threshold for co-activation has been reduced. 
5471.7,There's a much higher probability 
5472.99,that they will be activated together 
5474.67,at low levels of intensity. 
5476.574,That's essentially what long term potentiation is. 
5479.53,Long term depression says that if neuron A is active 
5483.28,"and neuron B is not active within a particular time window, "
5487.558,then the connection between neuron A and B will weaken 
5491.29,"over time, even if they started off very strongly connected. "
5495.51,"Okay? So, I'm going to repeat that "
5496.72,because this is a pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism 
5500.726,"whereby if neuron A, and neuron B is active, "
5505.12,"but at a different time or outside a particular, "
5507.781,"what we call, temporal window, "
5509.52,"meaning outside a particular time window, "
5512.04,"then through long term depression, "
5514.36,the connection between neuron A and neuron B will weaken. 
5518.24,"And just as a point of interest, "
5520.716,"the NMDA receptor is also involved in long term depression, "
5524.36,although there are other molecular components involved 
5526.88,as well. 
5527.713,So how do you take two neurons 
5529.651,that underlie a habit out of synchrony? 
5532.25,How do you get them to fire asynchronously? 
5534.153,This is pretty interesting with respect to the cellular 
5537.29,"and molecular biology, but at the behavioral level, "
5539.74,it's especially interesting. 
5540.683,"They way that one would do this is, let's say for instance, "
5543.627,you have a habit of picking up your phone mid work session. 
5549.52,Okay? That's a reflexive habit I think 
5551.84,that most people have experienced. 
5553.553,"And we often hear the idea that, oh, "
5557.27,the phone is so filled with access to dopamine 
5560.0,and incredible things that we're just drawn to it. 
5562.62,"But if you noticed what's happened with phone use over time, "
5565.895,"most people, including myself sometimes I admit, "
5569.02,"find ourselves just looking at our phone, "
5570.82,or find ourselves in a particular app 
5572.7,without actually having engaged 
5574.21,"in the conscious set of steps of, "
5575.567,"""Oh I'm really curious"" "
5576.557,"""what's going on in this particular app."" "
5578.157,"""I'm really curious"" "
5579.347,"""what's going on in this particular website."" "
5581.17,"And you just kind of ""find yourself"", in air quotes, "
5583.91,"for those of you listening, I'm making air quotes. "
5585.879,You just sort of find yourself doing it because the behavior 
5589.13,"of picking up your phone is sort of reflexive, "
5590.97,or has become fully reflexive. 
5593.12,You see this a lot at meals 
5594.85,where multiple people are there 
5596.48,and no one's looking at their phone 
5597.87,and then all of a sudden someone takes out their phone 
5599.41,and you'll notice 
5600.243,that other people just naturally take out their phone. 
5602.08,It's this kind observation induced reflex. 
5606.39,And I would wager that most people aren't consciously aware 
5610.52,of the immediate steps involved. 
5613.116,So the literature says there are a number of ways 
5616.04,"to break these sorts of habitual behaviors, "
5618.573,or reflexive behaviors. 
5620.98,Most of those approaches involve establishing some sort 
5624.75,of reward for not performing the activity 
5627.748,or some sort of punishment for forming the activity. 
5630.94,"I've heard of some basic things that some people will do, "
5633.1,"like they'll even put like a rubber band on their wrist, "
5635.0,"and every time they complain, "
5636.44,"or every time they do some behavior, "
5638.91,"like pick up their phone, "
5639.95,they'll give themselves a snap on the wrist. 
5641.57,"And yeah, the rationale there is that you're trying "
5643.86,"to create a somatic, a very physical representation "
5647.0,of something that makes it very real 
5649.88,and harder to overlook. 
5651.21,Other people will just do a tick mark on a piece of paper. 
5653.47,"This sort of, ""What gets measured is what gets managed"" "
5656.616,"kind of mindset, where if every time you do something, "
5659.41,"you take away the judgment, this is very new age-y, "
5662.73,"I realize, but this is what you find out there, "
5665.0,if you search the literature. 
5667.06,"Even on PubMed, peer-reviewed articles, "
5669.84,"that every time you engage in a behavior, "
5671.76,"you just measure the fact that you did that behavior, "
5674.93,you just mark it down. 
5675.81,"At the end of the day, people are supposed to look at that "
5677.75,"and say, ""Oh my goodness!"" "
5678.583,"""I can't believe that I spent, you know, "
3,"hours."" "
5681.922,"Or, ""I did it "
46,"times."" "
5683.456,"And in fact, a lot of apps, social media apps, "
5686.117,"will start to give you warnings now, if you opt in, "
5689.44,"that you've been on the app for an hour, "
5691.86,would you like to leave? 
5692.693,Most people just click right past it and go back in. 
5694.258,"I think very few people say, ""Oh my goodness!"" "
5697.337,"""It's been an hour and therefor you're right,"" "
5699.277,"""I absolutely shouldn't engage in this any more."" "
5701.53,It's just far to easy to just blow past those reminders. 
5704.092,"Well, the literature on habit formation "
5708.236,"and habit reduction, breaking habits, has been analyzed. "
5712.54,"There's a beautiful meta-analysis, "
5714.992,which involves looking at a number 
5716.76,"of different studies all together, "
5719.385,"comparing the statistical strength of each of those studies, "
5722.19,looking in different conditions 
5723.23,what sorts of habits were trying to be made or broken. 
5725.775,"The first author on this review is Fritz, F R I T Z. "
5731.07,I'll certainly put a link to this. 
5733.3,It's Heather Fritz and it's 
5734.887,"""Intervention to modify habits: a scoping review."" "
5737.38,And it is indeed a very broad scale review. It's from 
5739.37,the Journal of Occupation Participation and Health. 
5741.5,It's published in 
2020.,It's a really nice article. 
5744.075,A couple of things I learned from this article 
5746.03,and then I'll get into the specific tool 
5747.47,for breaking habits. 
5748.75,Perhaps the most interesting thing that I took 
5750.49,from this review was the finding 
5752.62,that notifications to either engage in habits 
5757.2,or to not engage in habits 
5758.84,actually were not very effective over time. 
5761.61,They were effective in the immediate period 
5763.97,"when people started using these notifications, "
5765.99,"as were little sticky notes, like, "
5767.797,"""Don't go into the refrigerator"" "
5769.117,"""between the hours of whatever and whatever."" "
5771.32,"Or just visual reminders, "
5773.604,physical reminders or electronic reminders 
5776.35,"were effective in the immediate term, "
5778.36,"but in the long term, did not predict whether "
5780.24,or not people would effectively stick 
5782.5,"to habits they were trying to stick to, "
5784.761,or break habits that they were trying to break. 
5785.97,"So sadly, that doesn't seem to work very well. "
5788.98,And perhaps they just need to come up 
5791.1,with more robust reminders. 
5793.24,"I don't know, mild electric shock "
5794.56,"or something like that because what we do know, "
5796.218,"only sort of kidding about mild electric shock, "
5799.342,but what we do know from both human 
5801.44,"and animal studies is that things like electric shock, "
5804.81,"things like monetary penalties, right? "
5807.61,Having to pay out every time you engage 
5809.34,in a particular behavior. 
5810.5,Those are pretty effective ways to break habits. 
5812.776,The problems is when people are not being monitored 
5816.043,"for habit use, for instance, "
5819.5,"you can imagine a situation where you say, "
5821.237,"""I'm not going to pick up my phone"" "
5822.507,"""for the "
4,"hours in the early part of the day"" "
5824.917,"""so I can get, you know, real dedicated focused work done."" "
5827.518,"Unless someone's monitoring them, then people don't tend "
5830.224,to monitor themselves completely enough 
5834.23,"that they punish themselves completely enough, "
5836.16,that they break the behavior. 
5837.07,"In other words, the punishment isn't bad enough, "
5839.5,"in order to break the habit, "
5840.56,which just speaks to how powerful these habits are 
5843.78,once they become reflexive. 
5844.95,"They're just very, very hard to override. "
5846.681,So it turns out that the key 
5848.65,to generating long term depression in these pathways 
5852.118,is actually to take the period 
5856.25,"immediately following the bad habit execution, "
5859.64,"meaning, let's say you tell yourself "
5860.87,"you're not going to pick up your phone, "
5862.713,"you're not going to bite your nails, "
5863.924,you're not going to reflexively walk 
5865.341,"to the refrigerator at a particular time or day, "
5866.29,"but you find yourself doing it anyway, "
5868.45,and what actually has to happen 
5870.55,is bringing conscious awareness 
5872.75,"to the period immediately afterwards, "
5874.35,"which I think most people recognize, "
5875.84,"they realize ""Ugh I just did it again. I just did it again."" "
5878.044,"And in that moment, capture the sequence of events, "
5882.01,"not that led to the bad habit execution, "
5884.961,but actually to take advantage of the fact 
5887.684,that the neurons that were responsible 
5889.94,"for generating that bad habit were active a moment ago, "
5893.454,and to actually engage in a replacement behavior 
5897.183,immediately afterward. 
5899.43,"Now, this is really interesting and I think powerful "
5901.52,because I would have thought 
5902.73,that you have to engage in a replacement behavior 
5905.368,"that truly replaces the bad habit behavior, right? "
5908.895,That you would have to be able 
5910.7,to identify your state of mind 
5913.08,"or the sequence of events leading into the bad habit, "
5915.78,"but rather, the stage "
5917.58,"or the period immediately after the bad habit execution, "
5920.22,"is a unique opportunity to insert a different type of, "
5923.97,"what we would call adaptive behavior, "
5925.75,but that could be any behavior that's not in line 
5928.88,"with the bad behavior, so let's give it an example. "
5931.82,"Let's say you find yourself, "
5933.2,"you're trying to do focused work, you pick up your phone, "
5935.617,"you're disappointed in yourself for picking up your phone, "
5938.856,"you could of course just put it down, "
5941.33,"and re-engage in the work behavior, "
5944.25,"but if you were good at that, "
5945.45,then you probably wouldn't have done it in the first place. 
5947.55,"And so, what turns out to be very effective, "
5949.93,is to go engage in some other positive habit. 
5952.93,"Now, this has two major effects. "
5954.97,The first one is you start 
5956.32,to link in time the execution of a bad behavior 
5959.52,to this other good behavior. 
5961.404,"And in doing so, you start to recruit other neural circuits, "
5965.829,"other neurons, that can start "
5968.34,to somewhat dismantle sequence of firing 
5971.58,associated with the bad behavior. 
5973.58,"In other words, you start to create a kind of a double habit "
5976.88,"that starts with a bad habit, "
5978.43,and then ends with a good habit. 
5980.35,And that seems to create enough of a temporal mismatch 
5983.492,so that then recognizing 
5986.02,when you're heading toward to bad habit 
5987.89,becomes more apparent to you. 
5990.13,"So again, I want to make this very, very concrete. "
5992.21,Let's say 
5993.043,that the behavior is reflexively picking up one's phone. 
5995.96,"You do that, you think, ""Ugh, goodness, I did it again."" "
5998.51,"Here's what I'm going to do, "
5999.63,you would set that down 
6000.8,"and then you would engage in some other positive behavior, "
6004.08,that you've deemed positive. 
6005.26,"And here, it's very subjective, so it's hard "
6006.95,for me to give an example 
6007.88,"that will necessarily make sense to everybody, "
6010.163,"but perhaps you're working on hydration, "
6012.7,so maybe you go have a glass of water. 
6014.32,Maybe you're trying to do breath work or something. 
6018.91,Maybe you're trying to enhance your language speaking skills 
6023.19,so you go and you spend 
5,minutes 
6024.89,doing a particular type of language learning. 
6028.05,You literally exit whatever you were doing 
6030.35,and perform that other new positive habit 
6032.96,"in the immediate period right after that, "
6034.73,even for a short period of time. 
6036.52,"It's a little bit counterintuitive, "
6038.17,but what this does it creates kind of a cognitive 
6040.569,"and a temporal mismatch between the initial bad behavior, "
6045.04,"which before is what we would call sort of a closed loop, "
6048.017,and the engineers out there will know 
6049.53,what I'm talking about. 
6051.425,"But in a closed loop, so one behavior, "
6053.044,"one set of neural firings, leads to another, "
6055.059,"leads to another, "
6056.08,and then just kind of sets the same thing in motion. 
6058.11,It can be kind of a self perpetuating system. 
6060.71,"By changing the number of features that are in that loop, "
6063.74,"it disrupts the closed nature of that loop, "
6066.7,"it creates what we call an open loop, "
6068.49,"and in an open loop, you are better able to intervene. "
6070.685,"So, as I mentioned before, this might seem counterintuitive, "
6073.787,"you might think, "
6074.727,"""Why would I want to reward the execution of a bad habit"" "
6078.477,"""with a good habit."" "
6079.787,"""I don't want to reward myself for the bad habit."" "
6082.13,But really what you're trying to do is you're trying 
6084.03,to change the nature of the neural circuits 
6086.6,that are firing so that you can rewrite the script 
6089.41,for that bad habit. 
6091.442,"A different way to put it would be, "
6093.845,imagine that the bad habit is like a chord on the piano 
6098.67,"that you play, or a chord notes, "
6100.28,"or a sequence of notes that you would play, "
6102.52,and it comes very easily. 
6104.15,You can play it every single time. 
6105.84,"But, let's say, "
6106.673,"as you're trying to learn a new piece of music, "
6107.89,you're just constantly inserting that 
6109.33,at the inappropriate time. 
6110.48,"That was, you know, I think it was a decent enough analogy "
6112.75,for a bad habit because it involves some motor execution. 
6115.64,You just find yourself doing it. 
6117.28,"Rather than trying to prevent yourself from doing it, "
6119.75,"the next time you do it, add in a new chord "
6122.79,or sequence that you're trying to learn. 
6125.7,What this does then is it changes the whole nature 
6128.3,of the sequence of neurons that are firing from bad habit 
6131.71,through to the end of this newly applied good habit. 
6135.47,"So, this is the way in which you start to dismantle or, "
6139.57,"when I say dismantle, really weaken the likelihood "
6142.73,"that if neuron A fires, neuron B will fire. "
6145.1,"Because, as you're starting off in the mode "
6148.11,"of very reflexively performing a bad habit, "
6150.76,those neurons are firing together 
6152.061,without you consciously being aware of it. 
6154.69,It's almost impossible for you to intervene in yourself 
6158.098,"without a number of other features, "
6160.317,"like severe punishment, severe consequence type outcomes. "
6164.284,"Rather, tacking on some additional sequences, "
6168.02,"like if neuron A, neuron B fires, and then you're saying, "
6171.397,"""Okay well, if neuron B fires,"" "
6173.137,"""I'm going to start inserting neuron C, D, E, F to fire."" "
6177.36,"Right? That's the, C, D, E, F being the positive behavior "
6180.89,that you're going to insert. 
6182.03,"And in doing so, you create a chain of neuronal activation "
6185.41,that then is very easy to dismantle. 
6187.86,"And so, when people have applied this kind of approach, "
6190.9,it removes the need to have constant conscious awareness 
6195.4,"of one's own behavior prior to that behavior, "
6198.44,"which is very, very difficult to achieve. "
6200.94,"Rather, what they find is that they are able to engage "
6204.45,in re-mapping of neural circuits associated with bad habits 
6207.72,"in ways that are very, very straightforward. "
6210.59,Right? Because you can always identify 
6212.54,when you've done the thing you don't want to do 
6214.17,and then tack on to that something additional 
6216.63,that's positive. 
6217.69,"Now, the nature of that positive thing is important. "
6220.69,You don't want it to be something 
6221.75,that's very hard to execute. 
6223.02,You want it to be something that's positive 
6224.61,"and fairly easy to execute, "
6226.39,so that you're not struggling all the time 
6228.06,"to insert this on top of this bad behavior, "
6230.711,whatever that bad behavior might happen to be. 
6233.52,"But again, "
6234.353,"this is rooted in the biology of long term depression, "
6236.82,it maps very well to the behavioral change literature 
6239.287,that I was able to glean that really shows 
6241.4,"that rather than just get reminders, "
6243.24,"rather than try and instill punishment, "
6244.9,"rather than setting up reward for breaking bad habits, "
6247.75,that perhaps the simplest way to approach this is 
6250.054,"to tack on additional behaviors to the bad habits, "
6253.6,"make sure those behaviors are good behaviors, "
6255.99,"or behaviors that are adaptive for you, "
6258.35,"and in doing so, you will soon find "
6260.65,that the initiation of the bad habit 
6262.47,takes on a whole new form 
6263.61,or that you're not even inspired to do it at all. 
6266.097,"And of course, I want to acknowledge "
6267.65,that breaking bad habits is really hard. 
6270.46,We had an episode all about addiction 
6272.612,with Dr. Anna Lembke from Stanford Medical School. 
6276.09,She's a colleague of mine 
6277.44,who runs the Dual-Diagnosis Addiction Clinic at Stanford. 
6280.48,"And in that episode, we talked a lot about how addicts "
6283.594,"for drugs, alcohol, people have addictions "
6287.41,"to certain types of behaviors, or avoidance behaviors even, "
6290.52,"that in the case of addiction, "
6291.8,there has to be a tremendous kind of full-scale campaign 
6295.067,for them to be able to intervene in their behavior. 
6297.53,"So, for those of you "
6298.363,that are thinking about bad habit breaking 
6299.68,"in the context of addictive type behaviors, "
6302.677,definitely check out that episode. 
6304.762,Addiction does employ some of these principles 
6307.63,"around habit making and habit breaking, as it were, "
6311.342,"but of course, because the consequences "
6314.511,"of certain habits in addiction can be so severe, "
6317.736,there's other sets of protocols 
6320.01,and there's a kind of a psychological backdrop to it 
6322.09,that's very important. 
6323.17,"It also relates to the biology of dopamine, "
6324.767,and you can find all of that in the episode 
6327.0,with Dr. Anna Lembke. 
6328.47,So today we've covered a lot about the biology 
6331.31,and the psychology of habit formation 
6333.41,and habit breaking. 
6335.02,"We talked about why certain habits are so hard to wire in, "
6340.27,why certain habits are so hard to break down 
6342.89,"and eliminate, and how we can determine "
6345.621,which habits are going to be easier for us to access 
6348.905,and which habits are going to be harder 
6350.94,for us to access and break. 
6353.45,We talked a lot about this notion of limbic friction 
6355.91,and we talked about context dependence. 
6357.74,And we talked about a number of different things 
6360.96,as it relates to neural circuits 
6362.58,"and the formation of new connections in the brain, "
6365.02,and strengthening and weakening of connections in the brain. 
6367.426,We also discussed two programs. 
6369.871,Programs designed specifically for you 
6372.18,on the basis of the neurobiology literature 
6375.04,and the literature on the psychology of habit formation 
6377.41,and habit breaking. 
6378.51,"Just to briefly recap, "
6380.307,one program involves dividing the 
24,hour day 
6383.672,"into three phases, phase one, phase two, phase three, "
6387.68,and to try and tackle specific habits 
6389.873,at particular phases of the 
24,hour cycle. 
6393.075,The second program involved a 
21,day process 
6396.976,of engaging approximately 
6,"new habits per day, "
6401.72,"although the expectation, as I mentioned earlier, "
6403.49,is that you're not going to perform all 
6,of those. 
6406.14,And an assessment in the following 
21,days 
6408.66,as to whether or not you have indeed formed those new habits 
6411.75,or not. 
6412.72,And there were a number of other features 
6414.4,that I mentioned that were related 
6415.71,to those two general programs. 
6417.15,"Phase one, phase two, phase three, and the "
21,"day program, "
6420.22,and how those could be meshed together. 
6422.45,"So, I'm guessing some of you will probably have questions "
6424.81,"about those programs and how to apply them, "
6426.91,but hopefully they were clear enough for you to get started. 
6429.178,This is a good opportunity for me to mention 
6431.82,that the Huberman Lab Podcast 
6433.72,has something called the Neural Network Newsletter 
6436.39,that is sent out approximately once a month. 
6439.198,"For the next newsletter, "
6440.832,I will release a on-paper version of these two systems 
6445.626,and how they mesh together for habit formation 
6448.06,"and habit breaking, and if you'd like to access that, "
6451.36,"you can go to hubermanlab.com, you go to the menu, "
6453.9,you can sign up for the newsletter. 
6455.51,"First of all, it's zero cost. "
6457.6,"Second of all, we have our privacy policy there, "
6460.01,"but I can tell you right now, "
6460.843,we don't share your email with any vendors 
6462.97,or with any other sources. 
6464.47,Those emails stay internal to us. 
6466.245,And if you'd like to see 
6468.04,"what the sort of flavor of those newsletters is, "
6470.83,"the previous newsletters, for instance, "
6473.16,"one on tools for sleep, that I mentioned earlier, "
6475.65,"or tools for neuroplasticity, in the classroom "
6478.97,"and outside the classroom as well, "
6480.61,"for teachers and for students of various kinds, "
6482.8,those are also posted there 
6484.32,so you can access any of the previous newsletters. 
6487.1,My hope is that today you've learned 
6488.61,both the biological mechanisms 
6490.49,and the practical tools by which you can start 
6492.72,"to establish habits that, for you, "
6495.17,"you deem adaptive, healthy, "
6497.11,and that are going to support you in your goals. 
6498.93,And that you can start to dismantle some of the habits 
6501.87,that you find to be unhealthy or maladaptive 
6504.69,for you and for your goals. 
6506.55,"If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast, "

6546.76,During today's podcast 
6547.95,"and in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
6550.68,I mentioned supplements. 
6551.767,"While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, "
6554.74,many people derive tremendous benefit from supplements. 
6557.042,"Supplements for sleep, supplements for focus, "
6559.56,supplements for various other things 
6560.96,related to mental and physical health and performance. 
6563.47,One key issue any time there's a discussion 
6566.03,"about supplements, you have to be sure "
6568.39,that the supplements you are taking 
6570.09,are of the very highest quality. 
6571.47,"And for that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, "
6573.6,"because Thorne has the very highest stringency, "
6575.75,"with respect to the quality of the ingredients they include, "
6578.24,and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients 
6580.5,that they include in their supplements. 
6582.56,"If you'd like to see the supplements that I take, "
6584.63,and get 
20%,"off any of those supplements, "
6586.87,"you can go to Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman and, "
6591.472,in addition to being able 
20%,"off any of those supplements, "
6594.889,if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site 
6597.35,"through that web portal, thorne.com/u/huberman, "
6600.7,you can also get 
20%,off any of the other supplements 
6603.37,that Thorne makes.

6608.639,"There, I teach neuroscience and neuroscience related tools "
6611.791,in short format. 
6613.288,Some of that material overlaps 
6615.09,"with what you hear on the podcast, "
6616.37,some of it is unique and different 
6617.85,from what's on the podcast. 
6619.31,"And once again, "
6620.143,I want to thank you for going on this journey 
6622.57,of exploring the neuroscience 
6624.504,and the psychology of habit formation and habit breaking. 
6628.14,I hope it supports you in your goals. 
6629.62,"And last but certainly not least, "
6631.701,thank you for your interest in science.
