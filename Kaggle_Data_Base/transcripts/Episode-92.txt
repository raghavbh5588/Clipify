0.36 - [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast
2.31 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.94 for everyday life.
9.43 - I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm
a Professor of Neurobiology
12.18 and Ophthalmology at
Stanford School of Medicine.
15.34 This podcast is separate
16.51 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
18.91 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
21.04 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
23.86 and science-related tools
to the general public.
26.82 In keeping with that theme,
27.99 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
30.93 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
33.88 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
36.22 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
38.68 to help you better understand your body
40.26 and reach your health goals.
42.2 I've long been a fan of
getting blood work done
44.84 for the simple reason
that many of the things
47.48 that impact our immediate
and long-term health
49.86 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
52.85 And now with the advent
of modern DNA tests,
55.84 we can also get insight into things
58.01 like metabolic factors
that tell us whether
60.52 or not we metabolize caffeine
well or certain proteins well,
64.35 what our fat metabolism genes are like.
67.69 Things of that sort can only be analyzed
69.58 from quality blood and DNA tests.
72.27 In addition, many of the factors
that impact our hormones,
75.52 our metabolism our brain health,
77.81 those come back in a blood and DNA test
80.27 and there are many blood
and DNA tests out there,
82.26 but with InsideTracker, they
give you a lot of clear insight
86.37 into what those markers
mean and how to adjust them.
89.54 They have this terrific
platform that doesn't just
92.21 give you the numbers back and tell you
93.6 if you're higher or low in some factor,
95.56 but rather it tells you
what your levels are
98.08 of all those factors and
gives you very simple
101.02 and clear directives of changes
you might make in your diet,
104.4 changes that you might make
in your exercise regimen,
107.78 or sleep, et cetera in
order to get those markers
110.62 where they ought to be
111.74 and where you would like them to be
112.95 in order to optimize yourself.
115.23 So they make everything
very easy, start to finish.
117.35 They can even come to your home
118.35 to take the blood and
DNA tests if you like.
120.8 If you'd like to try InsideTracker
122.36 you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
125.47 And if you do that, you'll get 25% off
127.88 any of InsideTracker's plans.

132.06 Today's podcast is also brought to us
133.8 by Belcampo Meat Company.
135.42 Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California
138.52 that raises organic grass fed
140.15 and finished certified humane meats.
143.08 While I don't eat a lot of meat, when I do
145.6 I insist that that meat
be a very high quality.
148.34 How the animals were cared for
is extremely important to me
151.88 and the life that the animal
had and what it consumed
154.93 is very important to me.
156.34 So the way that I eat I've
discussed on this podcast before
158.93 but very briefly, I basically
fast until about noon,
161.47 then I eat a piece of
beef or chicken with lunch
164.63 and a salad.
165.66 So that's basically my lunch.
166.65 That's what optimizes
my levels of alertness
168.81 for work throughout the day.
170.44 Then in the evening I shift over
172.02 to eating primarily carbohydrates.
174.1 That's what allows me to sleep very well.
176.52 So I'm not eating huge volumes of meat
178.76 but am eating meat every day.
181.56 Conventionally raised animals
are confined to feed lots
183.86 and need to diet of inflammatory grains
185.64 which is bad for them and it's bad for us
187.67 when we eat their meat.
189.26 Belcampo animals graze on open pastures
191.36 and seasonal grasses resulting in meat
193.04 that is higher in
nutrients and healthy fats.
195.07 And I've talked before
about the importance
197.03 of omega-3 fatty acids for
both brain and body health
200.38 and Belcampo meats are high
in omega-3 fatty acids.
203.93 The way Belcampo raises its
animals isn't just better
206.58 for your health, it also
has a positive impact
208.87 on the environment.
209.71 It's what's called climate
positive and carbon negative
212.09 which means good for the
planet and good for us.
215.5 My favorite meats from Belcampo
217.07 are the rib eye and the flank steaks.
219.2 That's typically what I eat.
220.35 I think I probably eat about three or four
222.07 of those across the week
and then I'll eat chicken
224.67 on some other days.
226.18 They're really delicious,
227.14 and as I mentioned,
they're very good for us.
229.57 You can order Belcampo
sustainably raised meats
231.89 to be delivered straight
to your door using my code
233.97 Huberman at belcampo.com/huberman.
238.061 If you do that, you'll get
20% off first time order.
241.43 That's belcampo.com/huberman
for 20% off your first order.
246.15 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Headspace.
249.28 Headspace is a meditation app backed
251.14 by 25 published studies
253.12 and has over 600,000 five star reviews.
256.81 So I've been meditating on and off
258.81 since I was about 15, 16 years
old, mostly off at first.
263.41 What I found is that I'll sometimes
265.68 start a meditation practice but
it's very hard to stay with.
268.83 And then a few years ago
I discovered Headspace
271.44 and I started meditating more regularly.
273.19 In fact, very recently because
I've had an exorbitant amount
277.08 of work on my plate and
I've been getting less sleep
279.78 than I would like in order
to complete that work,
281.76 I've brought back a regular
meditation practice twice a day
285.49 not just my usual once a day.
287.44 Headspace makes it really easy.
289.04 They have so many meditations on there
291.15 and they guide you into the meditation
292.96 and out of the meditation in a way
294.63 that just makes it very simple
296.61 and makes maintaining the
practice really straightforward.
299.95 Right now if you want to try Headspace
301.69 you can go to headspace.com/special offer.
304.79 And if you do that, you'll
get a free one month trial.
307.9 So that's totally free
309.23 with their full library of
meditations for every situation.
312.21 So there's no meditations
that you can't get access
314.76 to with this offer.
315.74 You can get access to
everything they've got.
317.71 You just go to
headspace.com/special offer.
320.72 You get a free one month trial
322.35 and hopefully you'll
decide to stay with it.
323.95 I've found that staying with meditation
325.81 has been immensely beneficial
for all aspects of my life.
329.14 Today's episode of the Huberman
Lab Podcast is our fourth
331.88 and final episode in this month
333.53 which is all about skills
and athletic performance.
337.77 Now, in a previous episode,
we talked about science-based
341.36 in particular neuroscience-based tools
343.71 for accelerating fat loss.
346.25 Previous to that, we talked about ways
348.15 to improve skill learning, motor movements
350.75 which also included things like music
353.16 and piano playing not
just athletic performance.
356.75 And we've also been
exploring other aspects
359.26 of physical performance
throughout the entire month.
362.16 Today I want to talk about something
363.93 that is vitally important for
not just athletic performance,
367.89 but for your entire life and
indeed for your longevity,
371.63 and that's muscle.
373.49 Now, many of you, when
you hear the word muscle
375.28 think muscle growth and
building big muscles.
378.0 And while we will touch
on muscle hypertrophy
380.32 muscle growth today, and
science-based protocols
383.51 to enhance hypertrophy,
we will mainly be talking
387.63 about muscle as it relates
to the nervous system.
390.84 And I can't emphasize this enough
393.48 the whole reason why you have a brain is
396.7 so that you can move.
398.25 And one of the things that's
exquisite and fantastic
401.73 about the human brain,
is that it can direct
404.29 all sorts of different kinds of movement,
406.87 different speeds of movement,
408.8 movement of different durations.
410.83 We can train our
musculature to lift heavier
414.19 and heavier objects or we
can train our musculature
416.83 to take us further and
further so-called endurance.
419.75 We can also build smoothness
of movement, excuse me,
423.73 smoothness of movement as
well as speed of movement,
427.67 suppleness of movement.
429.95 All of that is governed
by the relationship
433.81 between the nervous system, neurons
436.44 and their connections to muscle.
439.09 So when you hear the science of muscle
441.16 and muscle hypertrophy,
you might think, oh, well
443.527 I'm not interested in building muscle
445.75 but muscle does many critical things.
448.64 It's important for movement.
450.6 It's important for metabolism.
452.84 The more muscle you have
and not just muscle size
456.21 but the quality of muscle,
that's a real thing,
459.52 the higher your metabolism is,
461.77 and indeed the healthier you are.
464.15 It turns out that jumping ability
467.9 and ability to stand up quickly
469.7 and to get up off the floor quickly
471.54 is one of the most
predictive markers of aging
474.58 and biological aging and no
surprise that is governed
477.83 by the brain to muscle connection.
480.76 In addition, muscle and
musculature is vital for posture
485.32 and we don't talk about posture enough.
488.29 We all have been told we
need to sit up straight
490.22 or stand up straight, but
posture is vitally important
494.91 for how the rest of our body works.
497.56 It's vital to how we breathe.
499.31 It's actually even vital to
how alert or sleepy we are.
503.49 So we're going to talk about
the musculature for posture.
506.47 We also are going to talk about muscle
508.38 as it relates to aesthetic things.
510.66 Now, these are all linked.
512.11 Muscle for metabolism,
movement, posture and aesthetics
515.16 of course are linked, right?
516.57 As our posture changes,
our aesthetic changes.
518.9 As our posture and aesthetic
changes, how we move changes.
522.38 And as we improve muscle quality
525.284 whether or not that's
increasing muscle size or not,
528.73 that changes the way
that our entire system
531.32 not just our nervous system
and our muscular system
534.0 but our immune system and the
other organs of the body work.
537.68 So today, as always we're going to talk
539.84 a little bit of mechanism.
541.41 I'm going to explain how
neurons control muscle
544.94 and then we're going to
look at muscle metabolism,
548.16 how muscle uses energy.
549.81 I promise to make all of this very simple.
551.74 I'm actually going to keep it very brief
554.09 probably about 10 minutes total.
556.03 And by the end of that 10
minutes, you will understand a lot
559.05 about the neuromuscular connection,
561.06 how your brain and nervous
system control your muscle
563.58 and how those muscles work.
565.73 Then we are going to talk
about how muscles use energy
569.73 and can change how they use energy
572.24 for sake of getting stronger, if you like
575.04 for also increasing the size
so-called hypertrophy of muscle
578.88 and for improving endurance as
well as for improving posture
583.83 and how you move generally.
585.97 We will touch on some nutritional themes
588.163 and how that relates
to muscle in particular
590.41 a specific amino acid that
592.2 if it's available in your
bloodstream frequently enough,
595.4 and at sufficient levels,
can help you build
598.77 and improve the quality of muscle.
601.77 And we'll talk about
specific exercise regimes
604.64 as well as of course, supplementation
607.62 and things that can enhance
609.7 neuromuscular performance overall.
612.31 We are also going to talk about recovery.
614.96 Recovery as everybody knows,
is when things improve.
618.86 That's when neurons get
better at controlling muscle,
623.35 that's when muscle grows,
624.67 that's when muscle gets more flexible.
627.09 None of that actually
happens during training.
629.21 It happens after training and
there is a lot of confusion
632.51 about how to optimize
recovery and how to measure
635.26 whether or not you are recovered
and ready to come back in
638.94 for another neuromuscular
training session.
641.74 So we'll talk about that as well.
643.8 Today is going to have a lot of protocols
646.41 and you're going to come away
with a lot of understanding
648.39 about how you move, how you work
649.96 in these incredible organs
that we call the nervous system
654.37 and the musculature, the
so-called neuromuscular system.
658.56 Before we dive into today's topic,
660.8 I want to just take about three minutes
663.14 and cover some essential
summary of the previous episode.
667.77 In the previous episode,
we talked about fat loss.
670.84 Talked about shiver induced fat loss.
672.63 We talked about neat non-exercise
activity thermogenesis
676.13 for increasing caloric
burn and fat oxidation.
679.83 And we talked about how
to use cold specifically
683.0 to enhance fat loss.
685.16 I described a protocol
involving getting into cold
688.62 of some sort, whether or not
it's ice bath, cold shower,
691.97 some form of cold could
even be a river or an ocean
694.52 if you have access to
that and inducing shiver
697.25 and then getting out, not
crossing your arms or huddling
701.16 but allowing that cold to evaporate
703.01 off you and continuing to shiver
704.41 and then getting back into
the colder environment
706.81 of water or stream or shower, et cetera.
710.3 All of that is described
711.64 in a beautifully illustrated protocol
714.22 that I didn't illustrate.
715.89 That's why it's beautifully illustrated
717.55 at the coldplunge.com.
719.47 They've made that protocol for you
722.15 and they've made it available
free of charge for you.
725.09 So there's no obligation
there of any kind financially.
727.77 You can go to the coldplunge.com.
730.01 There's a little tab that says protocols
731.8 and you can download that
protocol, someone there
733.98 I don't know who exactly illustrated it,
736.0 and you can come away with a PDF
737.4 of what I described in
the previous episode.
738.537 So I just want to make sure
740.27 that you are aware of that resource.
742.57 The other announcement
I'd like to make is that
744.75 many of you have asked how you
can help support the podcast.
747.54 And there's a very straightforward
zero cost way to do that.
751.03 And that's to subscribe
to our YouTube channel.
753.58 So if you go to YouTube,
755.24 if you're not already
there watching this now
757.41 hits the Subscribe button
that helps us tremendously
760.39 to get the word out more
broadly about the podcast.
763.43 And we thank you for your support.
765.54 Most people, when they
hear the word muscle
767.69 they just think about strength.
769.47 But of course muscles are
involved in everything that we do.
773.11 They are involved in speaking,
774.38 they're involved in
sitting and standing up,
776.32 they're involved in lifting
objects, including ourselves.
780.18 They are absolutely essential
783.02 for maintaining how we breathe.
785.29 They're absolutely essential
for ambulation, for moving,
789.0 and for skills of any kind.
791.93 So when we think about muscle,
794.22 we don't just want to think about muscle
796.43 the meat that is muscle, but
what controls that muscle.
800.29 And no surprise what controls
muscle is the nervous system.
805.02 The nervous system does that
806.56 through three main nodes of
control areas of control.
809.89 And I've talked about these
before on a previous podcast.
812.18 So I will keep this very brief.
814.84 Basically, we have upper motor
neurons in our motor cortex.
818.28 So those are in our skull
820.3 and those are involved
in deliberate movement.
822.31 So if I decide that I'm
going to pick my pen
824.27 up and put it down, which
is what I'm doing right now,
826.55 my upper motor neurons were involved
828.22 in generating that movement.
829.95 Those upper motor
neurons send signals down
832.21 to my spinal cord where there
are two categories of neurons.
836.09 One are the lower motor neurons
838.88 and those lower motor
neurons send little wires
841.92 that we call axons out to our muscles
844.66 and cause those muscles to contract.
846.4 They do that by dumping
chemicals onto the muscle.
848.63 In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine.
852.14 I've talked before about
acetylcholine in the brain
855.26 which is vitally important for focus
857.65 and actually can gait neuroplasticity,
859.98 the brain's ability to change
in response to experience.
863.2 But in the neuromuscular system,
865.52 acetylcholine released from
motor neurons is the way
868.92 the only way that muscles can contract.
873.28 Now, there's another category of neurons
875.68 in the spinal cord called
central pattern generators
877.9 or CPGs.
879.0 And those are involved
in rhythmic movements.
881.98 Anytime we're walking or doing something
884.03 where we don't have to think about it
885.55 to do it deliberately, it's
just happening reflexively
888.87 that central pattern
generators and motor neurons.
891.33 Anytime we're doing
something deliberately,
893.465 the top-down control as we call it,
896.07 from the upper motor neurons comes in
897.98 and takes control of that system.
900.09 So it's really simple.
900.923 You've only got three ingredients.
902.16 You've got the upper motor
neurons, the lower motor neurons
904.25 and for rhythmic movements
that are reflexive,
906.37 you've also got the
central pattern generators.
908.83 So it's a terrifically
simple system at that level,
911.94 but what we're going to focus on today is
915.65 how that system can control muscle
918.0 in ways that make that system better.
921.0 Now, when I say better, I
want to be very specific.
924.27 If your goal is to build larger muscles,
927.84 there's a way to use your nervous system
930.26 to trigger hypertrophy
to increase the size
934.0 of those muscles.
935.13 And it is indeed controlled
by the nervous system.
938.35 So you can forget the idea
that the muscles have memory
941.16 or that muscles grow in
response to something
943.94 that's just happening within the muscle,
945.8 it's the nerve to muscle connection
947.54 that actually creates hypertrophy.
950.12 I'll talk exactly about how
to optimize that process.
953.26 In addition, if you want
to improve endurance
955.6 or improve flexibility or
suppleness or explosiveness,
959.49 that is all accomplished by the way
962.36 that the nervous system
engages muscles specifically.
965.74 And so what that means is
we have to ask ourselves
968.45 are we going to take control
of the upper motor neurons,
970.98 the central pattern generators,
or the lower motor neurons
973.9 or all three in order
to get to some end point
977.74 of how the nervous system controls muscle.
980.21 So neurophysiology 101.
983.37 I'll give you one piece of history
984.88 because it's important to know.
986.34 Sherrington, who won the Nobel prize
990.04 called movement, the final common path.
993.33 Why did he say that?
994.9 Well, the whole reason for
having a nervous system
998.07 the whole reason for having a brain is
999.72 so that we can control our
movements in very dedicated ways.
1003.74 That is one of the reasons,
perhaps the predominant reason
1007.63 why the human brain is so large.
1010.32 You might think, oh it's
so large for thinking
1012.07 and for creativity.
1013.33 Ah, no when you look at
the amount of real estate
1016.02 in the brain that's devoted
to different aspects of life,
1019.42 it's mainly vision, our ability to see
1023.19 and movement, our ability to engage
1025.87 in lots of different kinds of movements.
1027.77 Slow movements, fast movements,
explosive, et cetera.
1030.73 Other animals don't have that ability
1034.474 because they don't have
the mental real estate.
1037.79 They don't have the neural
real estate in their brain.
1040.88 They have neuromuscular junctions.
1042.46 They have central pattern generators
1043.74 what they don't have
1044.9 are these incredible upper motor neurons
1046.73 that can direct activity the
muscles in very specific ways.
1050.14 So we can all feel blessed
that we have this system.
1052.72 And today I'm going to teach
you how to use that system
1055.67 toward particular end points.
1057.74 So if we decide that we are
going to direct our muscles
1060.07 in some particular movement of any kind.
1062.69 Whether or not it's a
weightlifting exercise,
1064.81 or whether it's a yoga movement
1066.44 or simply picking up
and putting down a pen,
1069.56 we are engaging flexors and extensors
1072.14 and our body is covered with
flexors and extensors all over.
1075.63 So for instance, our bicep is a flexor
1077.76 and our tricep is an extensor.
1079.13 Those are what are called
antagonistic muscles.
1081.95 They move the limbs in
opposite directions.
1084.48 So if you bring your wrist
closer to your shoulder,
1086.54 that's flection using your bicep.
1088.67 If you move your wrist further
away from your shoulder,
1091.2 that's extension, using your tricep.
1093.23 And without getting into a lot of detail
1095.87 the way that the nerves and
brain are wired up to muscle
1099.22 make it such that when
a flexor is activated,
1102.95 when the nerve dumps
chemical acetylcholine
1106.06 onto the muscle to activate the biceps,
1108.66 the triceps is inhibited.
1111.25 It's prevented from engaging.
1114.279 There are ways to bypass this
1116.01 but that's the typical mode of action.
1119.46 The converse is also true when
our tricep is in activated,
1124.18 when we move our wrist
away from our shoulder
1126.46 our bicep is inhibited.
1128.2 And we have flexors like
our abdominal muscles.
1131.12 And we have extensors in our lower back.
1134.09 Many of you probably know this
1135.5 but some of you probably
don't that your spine
1137.61 has flexors to move basically
your chin toward your waist.
1141.13 And it has, those are your
abdominal muscles among others.
1144.86 And you have extensors that
move your chin, basically back
1148.71 like looking up toward the ceiling.
1149.98 And those are your extensors.
1151.48 You have other muscles that
are stabilizing muscles
1153.87 and things of that sort
1154.703 but those movements of
flection and extension,
1157.07 and the fact that they are
1158.88 what we call reciprocally
innovated or mutual inhibition,
1162.14 you hear different language around this
1163.79 is characteristic of most
of our limb movements.
1169.0 So hamstring and quadriceps,
the hamstring brings the ankle
1172.61 closer back towards the glutes.
1175.03 Basically it's lifting your heel up
1178.69 which is almost always
done toward the back.
1180.84 Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor
1183.55 opposite to the hamstrings.
1184.84 So you get the idea.
1185.73 So there's flexors and extensors
1187.17 and it's the neurons that
control those flexors
1190.33 and extensors that allow us
to move in particular ways.
1193.67 So, now you have heard a
neuromuscular physiology
1197.25 in its simplest form, but I
do want this to be accessible.
1199.99 I want to get just briefly, just briefly
1203.16 into some of the underlying metabolism
1205.18 of how muscles use and create energy.
1208.65 Because in doing that, we
will be in a great position
1210.93 to understand all the
tools that follow about
1213.35 how to optimize the neuromuscular system
1215.4 for your particular goals.
1216.87 So in the previous episode about fat loss,
1218.9 we talked about lipolysis.
1220.36 The breakdown of fat into fatty acids
1222.93 so it can be used as fuel.
1224.9 And it ended in a step where we got ATP,
1227.87 which is the bottleneck
and final common path
1230.98 for all energy producing
functions in the body.
1235.01 There are other ways but basically ATP
1237.63 is the key element there.
1239.55 Now with muscles, they don't
function on fats normally
1243.83 what they are going to function
on their ability to move
1246.82 and their ability to do
things and allow us to move
1249.42 in any way that we want to,
1251.47 is based on a process of glycolysis,
1253.92 the breakdown of things like glycogen
1257.18 and glucose into energy.
1259.49 And it's a very simple process.
1261.6 You don't have to know any chemistry.
1263.03 So if I say the words carbon or hydrogen
1265.05 or something like that, don't freak out.
1266.47 You don't have to
understand any chemistry.
1269.1 But basically what
happens is you've got this
1272.22 available sugar resource
that stored in muscle.
1277.1 And that's glucose.
1278.81 And that glucose has six carbons
and six waters, basically.
1285.67 That can be broken down into
two sets of three carbons.
1291.78 All right.
1292.613 So basically you take
glucose and you break it
1294.46 into these two little batches of carbons
1297.13 that we call pyruvate.
1298.37 So six divided by two is three.
1299.92 So you get three and three pyruvate.
1301.69 And that generates a
little bit of ATP of energy
1304.56 but just a little bit.
1306.45 Now, if there's oxygen available,
1309.61 if there's sufficient oxygen there,
1312.4 what can happen is that
pyruvate can be brought
1316.05 to the mitochondria and
through a whole set of things
1319.23 that you probably don't
want to hear about right now
1321.37 like the electron transport
chain and citric acid cycle.
1325.17 What happens is it's broken
down and you get 28 to 30 ATP,
1330.59 which has a lot of ATP.
1332.09 So the only things you need to know,
1333.83 the only things you need
to know about this process
1335.56 is that glucose and glycogen
are broken down into pyruvate.
1339.47 You a little bit of energy from that.
1340.973 And when I say energy, I
mean the ability to move.
1343.76 It's fuel, literally just gets burned up.
1346.5 But if there's oxygen
available and that's key
1349.93 then within the mitochondria,
you can create 28 to 30 ATP
1354.07 which is a lot of ATP.
1356.02 Now, what does this mean?
1357.07 This means that movement of muscle
1360.07 is metabolically expensive
and indeed compared
1362.92 to other tissues compared
to fat, compared to bone,
1366.17 compared to almost all other
tissues, except brain tissue
1369.58 muscle is the most metabolically demanding
1372.48 which is why people who
have more muscle relative
1375.71 to adipose tissue to
fat, they can eat more
1378.9 and they're more of a furnace.
1380.02 They just kind of burn that up.
1382.87 So even if you didn't understand
anything that I just said,
1385.84 what you probably did hear,
and that I hope you heard
1388.84 is that if you have oxygen
around, you can create energy
1392.1 from this fuel source that
we call glycogen and glucose.
1396.25 But what if there isn't oxygen around?
1398.97 And what is that like?
1400.29 Well, you've experienced that.
1402.56 I'm not talking about
oxygen in the environment.
1404.45 I'm talking about oxygen in the muscle.
1406.22 So if you've ever carried
a box while moving,
1409.11 or you're carrying heavy
groceries to the car,
1412.29 or you're exercising particularly hard
1414.41 and you felt the burn, well, that burning
1417.87 which most people think is
lactic acid is actually a process
1423.21 by which pyruvate, which as I said before
1425.98 normally could be converted
into ATP if there's oxygen,
1428.66 well, if there's not enough oxygen
1430.38 'cause that muscle is
working too hard or too long,
1433.26 what ends up happening is that
1434.88 a hydrogen molecule comes in there
1437.2 and you get something called lactate.
1439.14 So believe it or not, humans
don't make lactic acid.
1441.6 That's another species, we make lactate.
1445.436 And we hear that lactate is bad.
1447.66 We need to buffer the
burn or avoid the burn.
1451.0 That lactic acid and
lactate are what prevent us
1454.22 for performing as well
as we ought to be able to
1457.63 or going as far as we possibly could
1460.39 in an endurance event.
1462.03 Guess what, that's not true at all.
1464.22 Lactate has three functions,
1465.99 all of which are really
interesting and really important.
1468.55 First of all, it's a
buffer against acidity.
1472.81 You don't want muscle to get too acidic
1474.64 because it can't function.
1475.68 You don't want any body
tissue to get too acidic.
1477.92 So that burn that you feel is
acidity in that environment
1482.52 and lactate what most
people call lactic acid,
1485.35 but again, we don't make lactic acid.
1486.81 Lactate is there to buffer that
1489.08 to reduce the amount of burn.
1491.96 So, most people have
this exactly backwards.
1494.76 So when you feel that burn
that is not lactic acid,
1497.61 that is lactate that's
present to suppress the burn,
1502.12 to suppress acidity.
1504.57 It's also a fuel.
1506.53 When you feel that burn,
1508.16 lactate is shuttled to
those areas of the muscle,
1511.54 and there's an actual fuel burning process
1514.38 where in the absence of oxygen
1516.16 you can continue to generate
muscular contractions.
1519.01 Now, this is informative
'cause it also tells us that
1521.1 that burning that acidity that we feel
1524.23 can inhibit the way that our muscles work
1527.43 but that lactate comes
in and allows our muscles
1529.9 to continue to function.
1531.79 So we'll talk a little bit more about
1533.36 what this whole lactate
thing and the burn means
1536.55 but it's a really important process.
1538.05 And it's amazing to me that
most people understand it
1540.9 in exactly the incorrect way.
1542.89 They think a lactic acid
is bad and the burn is bad.
1545.48 No, it reveals a number
of really important things
1547.98 are going on with this
vital molecule lactate,
1550.78 which can reduce acidity, reduce the burn
1553.7 as well as act as a fuel.
1555.98 Now, here's where it
gets really, really cool.
1558.24 And if you don't have enough
of an incentive to exercise
1561.83 based on all the information out there
1563.37 about how it'll make you live longer
1565.14 and make your heart better, et cetera,
1567.27 here's a reason that regardless
1570.81 of what kind of exercise you do,
1572.22 if it's weight training, or
running, or cycling, or swimming
1575.83 that every once in a while,
about 10% of the time
1579.94 you should exercise to
the point of intensity
1582.89 where you start to feel
that so-called burn.
1586.88 The reason for that is
that lactate shows up
1591.37 to the site of the burn, so to speak,
1594.57 and it acts as a hormonal
signal for other organs
1597.536 of the body in a very positive way.
1601.22 As you may recall, from
a very early episode
1603.92 of the Huberman Lab
Podcast, I talked about
1605.87 what a hormone is and how it works.
1607.7 We have lots of different
kinds of hormones
1609.84 but hormones are chemicals that
are released in one location
1612.82 in the body and travel,
have effects on lots
1615.98 of other organs of the body.
1617.59 So when I say that lactate
acts as a hormonal signal,
1623.76 what I mean is that it's in a
position to influence tissues
1626.52 that are outside of the muscle.
1629.67 And basically it can send signals
1633.08 to the heart, to the
liver and to the brain,
1636.78 and it can have effects
on the heart, the liver
1638.93 and the brain that are very positive.
1641.67 So just to zoom out for a second
1643.21 I promise we won't get any
more technical than this.
1645.45 We will get into tools and protocols
1647.24 that are really straightforward
1648.86 but what I'm telling you is that
1651.63 if you feel a burn from a
particular exercise or movement,
1657.78 that burn is going to be buffered
1660.29 by this molecule we call lactate.
1662.82 Lactate will then provide additional fuel
1664.9 for additional work.
1666.01 So this is a good incentive
provided you can do it safely
1668.75 to "Work through the burn."
1671.07 That burn acts as a beacon to the lactate
1676.65 which comes in and allows
you to do more work.
1678.54 It's not a signal to stop necessarily.
1680.82 I mean, stop if you're
doing something unsafe
1682.58 but it's a signal that
lactate should come in
1685.52 and allow you to continue to do work.
1687.81 And it can act as a hormonal signal.
1690.88 Lactate can then travel to the heart
1694.17 and to the liver and to the brain
1696.06 and can enhance their
function in positive ways,
1698.45 not just in those moments,
1699.73 but in the period of time that follows.
1702.78 So many people are curious
about how they can exercise
1705.96 to make their brain better.
1707.29 That's one of the most
common questions I get.
1709.83 What I'm telling you is that
provided you can do it safely
1714.34 by engaging the so-called burn
1716.51 which is at a different
threshold for everybody,
1719.53 your hill run will be
different than my hill run
1721.67 to generate the burn,
1723.03 but provided you can do that for about 10%
1725.62 of your workouts or of
an individual workout,
1729.921 or activity of any kind, you
are generating the activity
1734.19 of this lactate based hormonal signal
1736.74 that can improve the function of neurons.
1740.4 And it does that if you want
to know for the aficionados
1742.78 by improving the function
of another cell type
1744.65 called the astrocytes which
are a glial cell type.
1747.53 Which are very involved in clearance
1749.07 of debris from the brain,
1750.4 they're involved in the
formation of synopsis
1752.61 connections between neurons in the brain.
1754.47 So put simply, if you are an exerciser
1758.39 if you're doing movement of
any kind, and you're interested
1760.8 in allocating some of that
movement toward enhancing
1764.33 brain, heart and liver
health, there is a nice set
1769.65 of scientific data that points to the fact
1771.77 that getting a lactate
shuttled to the muscles
1774.18 by engaging this burning
sensation is advantageous
1779.05 for the health of those other tissues.
1780.96 So, as I mentioned that burn is present
1783.17 from lack of oxygen being present.
1786.01 And then the hydrogen comes
in and you get this lactate.
1789.2 But this process of
lactate acting as a buffer
1792.76 of fuel and a positive hormonal
signal for other tissues,
1796.9 occurs only if there's oxygen.
1799.11 So if you feel the burn,
you definitely want to focus
1803.74 on your breathing at that point.
1805.32 That would be the time
to take deep inhales
1807.97 and try and bring more
oxygen into your system.
1810.413 It's definitely not a
time to hold your breath.
1812.55 And if ever you've run to
the point of feeling the burn
1815.08 and then you were exercised
in any way on the treadmill
1817.87 or on the bike or whatever,
and felt that burn,
1819.96 and then you held your breath,
1820.92 it feels much more intense.
1822.83 By breathing you bring lactate to the site
1826.9 and you are able to
allow lactate to act more
1830.24 as a buffer, a fuel,
and a hormonal signal.
1833.91 And the reason I brought this up today is
1835.85 because as I mentioned so
many people are interested
1838.25 in using exercise not just for sake
1840.22 of improving physical health
and wellbeing and performance,
1843.94 but also for enhancing their brain.
1846.34 And there are a lot of
data out there speaking
1849.28 to the findings that
exercise of various kinds
1853.72 can increase neurogenesis,
the creation of new neurons.
1857.64 Well, the unfortunate news is that
1860.42 while that's true in mice,
1861.95 there is very little evidence
for enhanced neurogenesis
1865.67 from exercise or otherwise in humans.
1868.06 There's a little bit,
and there are a few sites
1869.79 within the brain, such
as the dentate gyrus
1871.38 of the hippocampus, which may be involved
1873.86 in the formation of new
memories, to be clear
1876.27 the dentate gyrus is definitely involved
1877.9 in the formation of new memories,
1879.2 whether or not the new
neurons that are added there
1881.37 in humans are involved in new memories.
1884.7 The evidence for that
is weak at best, frankly
1887.96 whereas an animals the
data are quite strong,
1890.71 but most of the data points to the fact
1892.96 that hormonal signals,
things that are transported
1896.53 in the blood during exercise
are beneficial for the brain
1902.16 and that those signals are
not causing the increase
1905.901 in the number of neurons in
the dentate gyrus or otherwise.
1909.55 That it's more about the
health of the connections
1911.47 between the neurons growth
factors of various kinds
1914.02 things like IGF-1, there's
a long list of these things.
1916.89 So if you've heard the
exercise increases the number
1919.16 of neurons in your brain,
well, that's not true.
1921.487 And that probably is a good thing, frankly
1923.6 because we always hear
more neurons, more neurons
1926.18 as if it's a good thing, but
the brain doesn't do so well
1929.84 with bringing in entirely new elements.
1932.29 It has a hard time negotiating that
1934.65 and making use of those new elements.
1936.14 We know about this from things
like the cochlear implant
1939.35 where deaf people are given a device
1940.95 where they suddenly can hear.
1942.38 Some people really like that,
1944.61 deaf people really like that
and can benefit from it.
1946.73 Other deaf people find
that it's very intrusive.
1949.64 That is hard to take an existing
neural circuit in the brain
1954.6 and incorporate a lot of
new information into it.
1957.14 So new neurons, as great as that sounds
1959.04 more neurons, more neurons,
1960.51 it actually might not be the best way
1962.64 for the nervous system to
change and modify itself
1964.94 and to promote its own longevity.
1966.52 So when I tell you not such great evidence
1970.3 from new neurons past puberty,
1972.51 that's what the data
really show in humans.
1975.44 And I sort of knocked back the data
1977.36 on exercise and neurogenesis,
1979.35 don't let that depress you.
1980.62 If you have dementia in your family,
1983.233 don't translate that into necessarily
1986.84 that you will develop dementia.
1988.39 Understand the exercise
is still beneficial
1990.82 for the brain and other
aspects of the nervous system
1993.51 but that it's going to be doing it
1994.71 through these hormonal signals.
1996.44 Things like IGF-1, things
like this lactate pathway
2000.6 when you experience
the burn from exercise.
2002.61 And again, you don't want to try
2003.73 and get this feeling of a burn
2005.42 throughout the entire episode of exercise,
2008.62 there'll be far too intense and
would inhibit your recovery.
2011.41 I don't think it'd be good
for performance either.
2013.24 It's only about 10% of your total effort
2016.36 in any one exercise about
2018.16 that's going to give you
this positive effect.
2020.11 So now you know how to
devote a small portion
2022.02 of your exercise, 10% in
order for muscle and lactate
2026.878 to benefit other tissues
2028.65 namely your heart, your
liver, and your brain.
2031.69 I'd now like to shift our attention
2033.19 to how to use specific aspects
of muscular contraction
2037.35 to improve muscle
hypertrophy, muscle growth,
2040.44 as well as improving muscle strength.
2043.28 There are a lot of reasons
to want to get stronger.
2045.52 And I should just mention
that it's not always the case
2049.34 that getting stronger involves
muscles getting bigger.
2052.27 There are ways for muscles to get stronger
2054.33 without getting bigger.
2056.67 However, increasing the size of a muscle
2059.21 almost inevitably increases
the strength of that muscle
2062.41 at least to some degree.
2064.18 Reasons why most everyone should want
2066.71 to get their muscles stronger is that
2069.26 muscles are generally
getting progressively weaker
2072.05 across the lifespan.
2073.66 So when I say getting
stronger, it's not necessarily
2075.94 about being able to move increasing mounts
2079.04 of weight in the gym.
2080.61 Although if that's your goal
2081.96 what I'm about to discuss
will be relevant to that,
2084.97 but rather to offset some of
the normal decline in strength
2089.991 and posture and the ability
to generate a large range
2093.45 of movement safely, that occurs as we age.
2096.58 As I mentioned at the
beginning of the episode
2097.93 we just tend to lose function
in this neuromuscular system
2101.44 as we get older.
2102.57 And doing things to offset that
2104.91 has been shown again and
again, to be beneficial
2107.115 for the neuromuscular system
for protection of injury,
2111.47 for enhancing the strength
of bones and bone density.
2114.86 So there are a lot of reasons
to use resistance exercise
2118.0 that extend far beyond just the desire
2120.34 to increase muscle size
because I know many
2123.02 of you are interested in
increasing muscle size,
2125.76 but many of you are not.
2127.85 So there's an important
principle of muscle physiology
2130.48 called the Henneman size principle.
2132.81 And the Henneman size
principle essentially says
2135.41 that we recruit what
are called motor units.
2140.09 Motor units are just the connections
2141.83 between nerve and muscle from in a pattern
2146.23 that staircases from low
threshold to high threshold.
2150.27 What this means is when you
pick up something that is light,
2154.88 you're going to use the
minimum amount of nerve
2157.34 to muscle energy in
order to move that thing.
2160.1 Likewise, when you pick
up an object that's heavy,
2163.474 you're going to use the
minimum amount of nerve
2166.2 to muscle connectivity and energy
2168.28 in order to move that object.
2170.82 So it's basically a conservation
of energy principle.
2174.83 Now, if you continue to
exert effort of movement,
2179.43 what will happen is you will tend
2181.12 to recruit more and more
motor units with time.
2184.83 And that process of
recruiting more neurons,
2187.67 more lower motor neurons
2189.36 if you recall from the
beginning of the episode,
2191.47 these lower motor neurons
are in our spinal cord
2193.26 and they actually dump a
chemical acetylcholine on muscle,
2196.76 caused the muscles to contract.
2198.52 As you recruit more and
more of these motor units,
2201.88 these connections between these
2203.04 lower motor neurons and muscle,
2204.81 that's when you start to
get changes in the muscle.
2208.76 That's when you open the
gate for the potential
2212.03 for the muscles to get
stronger and to get larger,
2214.86 if that's what your goal is.
2216.46 And so the way this process works
2220.02 has been badly misunderstood
2222.73 in the kind of online
literature of weight training
2225.19 and bodybuilding, and
even in sports physiology.
2228.1 The Henneman size principle is kind of
2230.08 a foundational principle
within muscle physiology
2234.5 but many people have come
to interpret it by saying
2238.21 that the way to recruit
high threshold motor units,
2241.74 the ones that are hard to get to
2243.29 is to just use heavy weights.
2245.8 And that's actually not the case
2247.98 as we'll talk about the research supports
2250.29 that weights in a very large
range of sort of a percentage
2256.06 of your maximum, anywhere from 30% to 80%.
2260.22 So weights that are not very
light but are moderately light,
2264.15 too heavy can cause
changes in the connections
2267.74 between nerve and muscle that lead
2269.24 to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy.
2272.52 Put differently, heavyweights
can help build muscle
2277.29 and strength but they are not required.
2279.89 What one has to do is adhere
2281.71 to a certain number of parameters,
2283.45 just a couple of key variables
that I'll spell out for you.
2286.52 And if you do that, you can greatly
2289.33 increase muscle hypertrophy, muscle size
2292.19 and or muscle strength if
that's what you want to do.
2295.82 And you don't necessarily
have to use heavy weights
2298.68 in order to do that.
2299.77 Now, I'm sure the power lifters
2301.25 and the people that like to
move heavy weights around
2304.49 will say, no, if you want to get strong
2306.5 you absolutely have to lift heavy weights.
2308.63 And that might be true if
you want to get very strong
2311.63 but for most people who are interested
2313.83 in supporting their muscular
such that they offset
2317.3 any age related decline in strength,
2319.98 or in increasing hypertrophy
and strength to some degree,
2324.19 there really isn't a need
2325.72 to lie about the Henneman size principle
2328.41 which many people out there are doing
2330.07 and claiming that you absolutely need
2332.24 to use the heaviest weights possible
2333.74 in order to build strength and muscle.
2335.43 So I'm going to explain all
of this works in simple terms.
2338.95 So first of all, let's just
talk about what hypertrophy is
2342.41 and what strength changes
in the muscle are.
2345.389 We can make this very simple as well.
2347.8 If this were a muscle physiology class
2349.57 we would talk all about myofibrils
2352.32 and sarcomeres and all that stuff.
2353.77 We're not going to do that.
2354.603 That's not the purpose
of today's conversation.
2357.21 If you're interested in that
2358.67 as well as a lot of the other information
2360.62 that I'm going to discuss in more detail,
2363.52 I highly encourage you to
check out the YouTube channel
2367.34 and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin.
2370.31 He's a PhD and a full professor
in exercise physiology.
2373.57 He's extremely knowledgeable
in this entire area
2376.78 of science-based tools for hypertrophy,
2379.59 how strength and hypertrophy really work.
2381.67 His lab does everything
from biopsy on muscles,
2384.14 working with athletes and
typical folks as well.
2386.89 A lot of the information
that you're going to hear
2388.55 from me in the next 15 minutes or so
2390.41 comes from an extensive
exploration of the work
2393.96 that he and his colleagues
have done as well
2396.01 as folks like Brad Schoenfeld,
another academic who's superb
2399.57 in this whole space of muscle physiology
2401.62 and from a lengthy conversation
that I had with Andy,
2405.17 Dr. Galpin prior to this episode.
2408.2 So if we want to think
about muscle hypertrophy,
2411.66 we have to ask what is changing
2413.43 when muscles get larger or stronger.
2415.26 And there are really just three ways
2417.83 that muscles can be stimulated to change.
2420.52 So let's review those three ways
2421.86 and talk about what
happens inside the muscle.
2424.35 So there are three major stimulate
2426.38 for changing the way that muscle works
2429.46 and making muscles stronger,
larger, or better in some way.
2433.54 And those are stress, tension, and damage.
2438.95 Those three things don't
necessarily all have to be present
2442.4 but stress of some kind has to exist.
2444.69 Something has to be different
2446.54 in the way that the nerve communicates
2448.4 with the muscle and the way
that the muscle contracts
2450.65 or performs that makes
the muscle need to change.
2455.01 So this is very reminiscent of
neuroplasticity in the brain.
2458.08 Something needs to happen.
2460.16 Certain chemicals need to be present.
2461.81 Certain processes need to happen
2463.81 or else a tissue simply
won't change itself.
2466.6 But if those processes
and events do happen,
2469.7 then the tissue has
essentially no option except,
2473.22 but to change.
2474.71 So muscles move, as I mentioned
2477.95 because nerves dump
chemical onto the muscles
2480.7 but they move because they
have these things called myosin
2484.55 and actin filaments.
2485.58 And if you want to read up on this,
2487.04 you can look on the internet
2489.36 you can put the sliding filament theory
2491.24 of muscle contraction if you
really want to go deep down
2493.43 that rabbit hole.
2494.38 It's interesting.
2495.34 You can learn about this in
a muscle physiology class.
2498.1 But basically, along
the length of the muscle
2501.308 you have, what's called myosin.
2503.23 And just think of myosin
as kind of like a wire.
2506.798 It's like a bunch of beads and wires
2509.61 that extend across the muscle.
2511.23 I think that's the simplest
way to describe it.
2513.46 And the myosin is surrounded
2515.1 by these little beads called actin.
2518.29 The way muscles get bigger is
2520.63 that basically the myosin gets thicker.
2524.77 It's a protein and it gets thicker.
2527.649 So put this in your mind
if you're listening to this
2530.33 or even if you're watching it on YouTube,
2532.33 the way to think about this
whole actin myosin thing
2533.987 and thing and muscles
getting bigger is imagine
2536.15 that you're holding a bouquet of balloons,
2538.94 a bunch of balloons by their strings
2541.13 except you're not holding the
strings all at their bottom.
2543.73 So the bouquet isn't nicely arranged.
2545.39 It's not like some balloons
that are all up at the top
2548.08 and you're holding the
strings down at the bottom.
2550.52 Imagine that one of the
balloons that is very close
2553.13 to your hand and other one
is a little bit higher up.
2555.36 And so this bouquet is very disorganized.
2557.35 In other words, the string
extending out of your hand
2559.73 the strings rather
extending out of your hand
2561.61 are all different lengths.
2563.07 And so the balloons
are all over the place.
2565.95 That's essentially what myosin
looks like in the muscle.
2569.28 And those strings are what
we call the filaments,
2571.92 and then the myosin head is the balloon.
2576.06 When you stress a muscle properly,
2578.63 or you give it sufficient tension,
2580.95 or you damage the muscle just enough,
2584.34 there's an adaptive
response that takes place
2586.65 where protein is synthesized.
2588.47 And it's a very specific
protein, it's myosin.
2591.4 The myosin gets thicker.
2592.95 In other words, the balloons get bigger.
2596.44 So the way to think about muscle growth
2598.83 and the way to think about
muscles getting stronger is
2602.23 that those balloons get bigger
and the muscle gets thicker.
2606.94 Now, the question then should be as always
2610.24 how does that happen?
2611.4 I mean, the muscle doesn't
really know anything
2613.71 about what's happening
in the outside world.
2616.37 The way it happens is
the nerve, the neuron has
2619.59 to tell the muscle to get stronger.
2622.22 And it does that through what
we call a signaling cascade.
2625.31 It talks to the muscle
in terms of chemicals.
2627.07 It doesn't whisper to it or
shout or Hey, get bigger.
2629.63 What it does it release
a certain chemicals
2631.9 that within the muscle,
2633.219 there are certain
chemicals released rather
2635.15 that make those balloons
as I'm referring to them,
2637.94 the myosin get thicker.
2639.57 So let's talk about the
stimulus for doing that.
2642.26 And if already in your
mind, you're imagining
2644.76 oh my goodness, these balloons of muscle
2646.297 are going to get thick,
thick, thick, thick, thick,
2647.94 and it's just going to
spiral out of control,
2650.76 don't worry about that.
2651.72 People invest a ton of time and energy
2653.63 into trying to make their muscles larger.
2655.7 It's actually much harder for people to do
2657.83 than you might think.
2659.08 But I do want to give one
exception because it illustrates
2662.0 an important principle of
where we're headed next.
2664.93 Everybody has imbalances
in how muscles can grow.
2672.46 How well muscles can grow, or how poorly,
2675.24 or how challenging it is
for their muscles to grow.
2677.87 Now, many people who are afraid
of like getting too bulky
2681.75 for instance, are afraid
of lifting weights.
2683.75 But I think the research
shows now that every one
2686.78 of pretty much every age should be doing
2688.45 some sort of resistance exercise
2690.18 even if that's body weight exercises
2692.54 in order to offset this
age-related decline
2695.229 in muscle contractile ability,
2697.47 muscle strength, et cetera,
improve bone density.
2700.6 There's nothing good about
getting frail and weak over time.
2705.1 And people who invest the effort
2707.416 into doing resistance
exercises of some kind
2710.98 whether or not it's with
bands or with weights
2712.59 or with body weight,
really benefit tremendously
2715.82 at a whole body level at a systemic level
2718.27 as well as in terms of muscle strength.
2721.81 There is a good predictor of how well
2725.49 or how efficient you will
be in building the strength
2728.577 and or if you like the
size of a given muscle.
2732.22 And it has everything to do
with those upper motor neurons
2734.86 that are involved in
deliberate control of muscle.
2737.28 You can actually do this test right now.
2739.49 You can just kind of March
across your body mentally
2742.66 and see whether or not you
can independently contract any
2746.97 or all of your muscles.
2748.37 So for instance, if you
are sitting in a chair
2750.82 or a you're standing,
2752.64 see whether or not you can
contract your calf muscle
2755.64 just using those upper motor
neuron, sending a signal down
2758.56 and deliberately
isolating the calf muscle.
2761.78 If you can contract the calf muscle hard
2765.09 to the point where that
muscle almost feels
2767.48 like it's starting to cramp
2768.39 like it hurts just a little bit,
2770.43 that can be extremely painful
2772.29 nor is it going to have
no sensation whatsoever,
2775.67 chances are you have very good
2777.4 upper motor neuron to calf control.
2780.33 And chances are, if you can isolate that
2783.74 what they call the brain
or mind muscle connection,
2786.61 and you can contract the muscles
2787.59 to the point where it cramps a little bit,
2789.84 that you hold a decent to high potential
2793.08 to change the strength and
the size of that muscle
2796.37 if you train it properly.
2797.98 Now, if you have a hard time doing that,
2800.02 chances are you won't be able to do that.
2803.33 If for instance, you
focus on your back muscle.
2807.73 Like we all have these
muscles called the lat.
2810.17 The latissimus dorsi muscles,
which basically are involved
2813.02 in chin ups and things like that,
2813.947 but their function from a more
of a kinesiology standpoint
2818.24 is to move the elbow back behind the body.
2821.56 So it's not about flexing your bicep.
2823.049 It's about moving your
elbow back behind your body.
2825.33 If you can do that, mentally
2828.57 or you can do that physical movement
2830.38 of moving your elbow back behind your body
2832.26 and you can contract that muscle hard,
2834.16 chances are that you have the capacity
2836.73 to enhance the strength and or size
2839.58 of that particular muscle
2841.31 because you have the neural
control of that muscle.
2844.58 This is a key feature of
the neuromuscular system
2847.77 to appreciate as we begin to talk more
2850.31 about specific protocols.
2852.53 Because everything about
muscle hypertrophy,
2856.21 about stimulating muscle growth is
2859.1 about generating isolated contractions
2862.29 about challenging specific
muscles in a very unnatural way.
2868.32 Whereas with strength, it's
about using musculature
2871.15 as a system moving
weights, moving resistance,
2874.5 moving the body.
2876.54 The specific goal of hypertrophy is
2879.29 to isolate specific
nerve to muscle pathways
2882.29 so that you stimulate the chemical
2884.38 and signaling transduction
events in muscle
2886.49 so that those muscles
respond by getting larger.
2889.38 So there's a critical distinction
2891.03 in terms of getting stronger versus trying
2893.57 to get muscles to be
larger hypertrophy per se.
2897.87 And it has to do with how much
you isolate those muscles.
2901.4 Muscle isolation is not
a natural phenomenon.
2904.48 It's not something that we normally do.
2905.84 When we walk we don't think,
okay, right calf contract,
2908.83 left calf contract.
2909.94 No, you just generate
those rhythmic movements.
2912.11 And of course, there's no
reason for them to get stronger
2914.64 or larger in response to those movements.
2916.75 Let's say you were to do a
kind of strange experiment
2919.43 of attaching 30 pound
weights to your ankles.
2921.64 And you were to do those movements.
2923.65 Well, if you weren't specifically
contracting your calves
2926.93 in each step, there's
no reason for the calves
2929.28 to take on the bulk of the work.
2931.51 And you would distribute that
work across your hip flexors
2934.13 and other aspects of your musculature.
2935.56 Your whole nervous system
seeks to gain efficiency.
2938.53 It seeks to spread out the effort.
2941.24 So you can nest this as
a principle for yourself
2944.76 which is if you want to get stronger
2946.81 it's really about moving
progressively greater loads
2950.58 or increasing the amount
of weight that you move.
2953.13 Whereas if you're specifically interested
2955.26 in generating hypertrophy,
it's all about trying
2958.57 to generate those really hard,
2960.81 almost painful localized
contractions of muscle.
2964.21 Now, of course, how much weight you use
2965.82 in order to generate those contractions
2967.55 will also impact hypertrophy.
2969.86 But I think most people
don't really understand
2971.93 the mind muscle connection.
2973.14 It sounds like a great thing,
2974.66 but it's actually one of
the things you want to avoid
2977.66 if your goal is simply
to become more supple
2980.47 or to become stronger.
2982.86 You want to do the movements
properly and safely, of course
2985.94 but it's the opposite of hypertrophy
2988.86 where with hypertrophy
you're really trying to make
2990.89 that particular muscle
sometimes two muscles
2993.81 do the majority, if not all the work
2996.61 whereas in moving force loads
2998.41 in trying to generate activity of any kind
3002.1 like lifting a bar, doing
a chin up or something
3004.53 those so-called compound
movements involve a lot
3006.76 of muscle groups.
3008.018 If your goal is to be better at those,
3010.93 you want to avoid isolating
any one particular muscle.
3014.7 Now, I know this probably comes across
3016.01 as a kind of obvious duh,
especially to the folks
3019.76 who have spent a lot of time in the gym
3022.29 aimed at getting hypertrophy.
3024.22 But I think most people don't appreciate
3025.77 that it's the nerve to muscle connections
3027.71 and the distinction
between isolating nerve
3030.21 to muscle connections
versus distributing the work
3033.19 of nerve to muscle connections,
3034.8 that's vital in determining whether or not
3036.85 you generate hypertrophy isolated nerve
3039.07 to muscle contractions versus strength
3041.818 and offsetting strength loss
3044.2 which would be distributed
nerve to muscle connections.
3047.43 If ever there was an
area of practical science
3049.87 that was very confused,
very controversial,
3053.29 and almost combative at times,
3055.57 it would be this issue
of how best to train.
3058.29 I suppose the only thing
that's even more barbed wire
3061.01 of a conversation than that
is how best to eat for health.
3064.08 Those seem to be the two most common areas
3067.07 of online battle and the
scientific literature
3071.37 has a lot to say about
both of those things.
3073.72 Again, my sources for
what I'm about to tell you
3076.47 are Professor Andy Galpin and colleagues.
3079.261 I know there are other
excellent people out there
3081.47 in the field, but I really trust his work.
3083.61 He does very controlled studies.
3086.42 He spent a lot of time in this space
3087.79 and what's really exciting is that
3089.54 in just the last three years or so,
3091.873 there's been a tremendous
amount of information
3094.34 to come out about the practical
steps that one can take
3097.1 in order to maximize the benefits
3100.059 of resistance exercise of any kind.
3103.32 So I'm going to talk about those
3104.76 and I'm going to talk about the research.
3106.34 I will provide some links,
a couple of the more
3109.27 in-depth tutorials from
Dr. Galpin, as well as some
3113.58 of the papers that the
information I'm about
3115.62 to tell you stems from.
3118.679 There's a lot of information saying
3120.87 that you need to move
weights that are 80 to 90%
3125.15 of your one rep maximum
or 70%, or cycle that
3127.81 for three weeks on and then
go to more moderate weights.
3129.84 There are a lot of
paths as some people say
3132.7 there are a lot of ways to
add up numbers to get a 100.
3136.19 There's a near infinite number of ways
3137.79 to add up different
numbers to get to a 100.
3140.26 And what's very clear now
3142.33 from all the literature that's transpired
3144.73 and especially from the literature
in this last three years,
3147.24 is that once you know roughly
your one repetition maximum,
3152.27 the maximum amount of
weight that you can perform
3156.57 an exercise with for one repetition
3158.88 in good form, full range of motion,
3161.96 that it's very clear that moving weights
3166.37 or using bands or using
body weight, for instance
3171.18 in the 30% to 80% of one-rep maximum.
3174.76 That is going to be the
most beneficial range
3177.45 in terms of muscle
hypertrophy and strength.
3179.68 So muscle growth and strength.
3181.55 And there will be a bias
if you're moving weights
3184.1 that are in the 75%, 80% range
3187.04 or maybe even going above that 85 and 90%,
3189.78 you're going to bias your improvements
3192.46 towards strength gains.
3193.83 This is true.
3195.01 And if you use weights that are in the 30%
3197.47 of your one-repetition
maximum or 40% or 50%
3200.97 and doing many more
repetitions, of course,
3203.4 then you are biasing towards hypertrophy
3205.76 and what some people like
to call muscle endurance.
3207.97 But that's a little bit
of a complicated term
3209.99 because endurance, we almost
always think of as relating
3213.04 to running or swimming or
some long bouts of activity.
3216.53 So 30% to 80% of one-repetition maximums,
3219.47 it doesn't really seem to matter
3221.85 for sake of hypertrophy,
except at the far ends
3224.8 when you're really trying
to bias for strength.
3227.36 Now, it is clear, however
3230.35 that one needs to perform those sets
3234.27 to failure where you can't
perform another repetition
3237.724 in good form again or near to failure.
3241.78 And there's all sorts of
interesting nomenclature
3243.71 that's popping up all over the internet.
3245.49 Some of which is scientific,
some of which is not scientific
3247.98 about how you are supposed to perceive
3250.7 how close you were to failure, et cetera.
3253.06 But there are some very
interesting principles
3255.96 that relate to how the
nerves connect to the muscles
3258.38 that strongly predict
whether or not this exercise
3260.78 that you're performing will
be beneficial for you or not.
3263.51 So here's how it goes.
3264.93 For individuals that are untrained
3267.5 meaning they have been
doing resistance exercise
3271.4 for anywhere from zero,
probably out to about two years,
3275.15 although for some people, it
might be zero to one year,
3277.91 but those are the so-called beginners.
3279.58 They're sort of untrained.
3281.35 For those people, the
key parameter seems to be
3284.15 to perform enough sets of a given exercise
3287.64 per muscle per week.
3290.38 The same is also true for
people that have been training
3292.68 for one or two years or more.
3294.67 What differs is how many sets to perform
3298.019 depending on whether or not
you're trained or untrained.
3300.11 So let's say you're somebody
3300.943 who's been doing some
resistance exercise kind of
3303.83 on and off over the years
and you decide you want
3307.28 to get serious about
that for sake of sport
3309.14 or offsetting age related
declines in strength,
3312.93 the range of sets to do in
order to improve strength
3316.67 to activate these cascades
in the muscle ranges anywhere
3320.22 from two, believe it
or not to 20 per week.
3323.6 Again, these are sets per week
3325.11 and they don't necessarily
all have to be performed
3327.53 in the same weight training session.
3328.747 I will talk about numbers of sessions.
3331.29 So it appears that five sets
per week in this 30% to 80%
3337.85 of the one repetition maximum range,
3340.36 getting close to failure,
or occasionally actually
3344.59 going to full muscular
failure, which isn't really
3347.65 full muscular failure, but the inability
3349.35 to generate a contraction of the muscle
3351.89 or move the weight in good form.
3353.55 I'll go deeper into that in a moment.
3354.86 But about five sets per
week is what's required
3357.19 just to maintain your muscle.
3358.94 So think about that.
3359.86 If you're somebody who's kind of averse
3361.23 to resistance training,
you are going to lose
3363.97 muscle size and strength.
3365.36 Your metabolism will drop.
3366.48 Your posture will get worse.
3368.13 Everything in the context of nerve
3370.3 to muscle conductivity
will get worse over time,
3373.85 unless you are generating
five sets or more
3379.23 of this 30% to 80% of your one
repetition maximum per week.
3384.09 So what this means is
for the typical person
3386.36 who hasn't done a lot of weight training,
3387.79 you need to do at least
five sets per muscle group.
3391.55 Now, that's just to maintain.
3393.48 And then there's this huge range
3395.09 that goes all the way up to 15
3396.38 and in some case, 20 sets per week.
3398.67 Now, how many sets you
perform is going to depend
3401.83 on the intensity of the
work that you perform.
3405.13 This is where it gets a
little bit controversial
3407.16 but I think nowadays most people agree
3410.04 and Dr. Galpin confirmed
that 10% not to be confused
3414.96 with the 10% we discussed
earlier, but 10% of the sets
3419.9 of a given workout or
10% of workouts overall
3425.34 should be of the high-intensity sort
3427.56 where one is actually
working to muscular failure.
3429.77 Now I say not true muscular failure
3431.77 because in theory you
have a concentric movement
3434.51 which is the kind of
lifting of the weight,
3435.96 and then you have the ecentric portion
3437.38 of muscle contraction,
which is the lowering.
3439.26 And ecentric movements because of the way
3441.66 that muscle fibers lengthen
and that sliding act myosin
3445.41 that we talked about before,
3446.56 you're always stronger
in lowering something
3448.9 than you are in lifting it.
3451.55 But the point being that
most of your training
3454.64 most of your sets should
be not to failure.
3458.76 And the reason for that is it
allows you to do more volume
3462.17 of work without fatiguing
the nervous system
3466.13 and depleting the nerve
to muscle connection
3468.7 in ways that are detrimental.
3470.71 So we can make this simple.
3472.94 Perform anywhere from 5 to 15 sets
3476.1 of resistance exercise per week,
3479.3 and that's per muscle, and
that's in this 30% to 80%
3483.79 of what your one-repetition maximum.
3485.53 That seems to be the most
scientifically supported way
3488.83 of offsetting any decline
in muscle strength
3492.58 if you're working in the
kind of five set range
3494.55 and in increasing muscle strength
3498.15 when you start to get up
into the 10 and 15 set range.
3501.4 Now, the caveat to that is everyone varies
3504.42 and muscles vary in terms
of their recover ability.
3508.51 Depending on how well you
can control the contraction
3511.39 of muscles deliberately.
3513.65 And you can actually figure
that out by sort of marching,
3516.02 you might take five minutes
3516.98 and just kind of March across your body
3518.36 and mentally try and
control the contractions
3520.68 of muscles in a very deliberate way
3523.4 to the point where you can
generate a hard contraction.
3525.65 And you may have to move a limb
3526.77 in order to do this, by the way.
3527.85 I'm not talking about just
mentally contracting your bicep
3530.79 without moving your wrist.
3531.71 I'm talking about doing
that without any weight
3534.06 in hand or any band or any resistance.
3536.83 If you can generate a
high intensity contraction
3539.45 using these upper motor neuron
3540.78 to lower motor neuron pathways to muscle,
3544.79 you might think, well I
should perform many more sets.
3549.35 But actually, the opposite is true.
3552.121 If you can generate high-intensity
muscular contractions
3555.52 using your brain, using your neurons,
3557.76 it will take fewer sets in
order to stimulate the muscle
3562.3 to maintain itself and
to stimulate the muscle
3565.56 in order to grow or get stronger.
3568.2 So the more efficient you are
in recruiting motor units,
3572.25 remember, Henneman's size principle
3574.03 the recruit men have more motor units
3576.18 which isn't just muscles,
3577.46 it's nerve to muscle connections.
3579.18 The better you are at doing that, the more
3581.36 you will recruit these so-called
high threshold motor units
3583.94 the ones that are hard to get to,
3585.51 the more you will kick
off the cascades of things
3587.68 within muscle that stimulate
muscle growth and strength.
3592.25 So if you have muscles that
are challenging to contract,
3596.31 it's going to take more sets
3598.22 in order to stimulate the desired effect
3601.49 in those muscles not fewer.
3604.46 If you have muscles that you are very good
3606.32 at generating force within,
it's going to take fewer sets.
3609.58 Now, how many sets you are
going to have to determine that
3612.62 it's going to depend for
those of you that are using
3614.52 like 50% of your one-repetition maximum,
3617.52 because you're doing a lot of repetitions,
3619.35 you might find that
three or four, five sets
3622.17 will maintain the muscle.
3624.14 You might decide to do that once
3625.61 at one point in the week
and then do it again.
3628.53 So if you're going for 10 sets a week
3629.76 you can divide that among two sessions.
3631.29 You could do that all in one session.
3633.83 The data really show it doesn't matter.
3636.8 There are some differences in terms of
3639.86 whether or not you're trying
to generate maximum intensity
3642.41 within a workout or whether or not
3643.43 you want to spread that out.
3644.27 But in general, resistance workouts
3646.2 of any kind tend to be best favored
3648.329 by workouts that are somewhere
3650.53 between 45 minutes and 60 minutes.
3653.75 And generally not longer than 60 minutes
3655.72 because that's when all
the things like cortisol
3658.2 and some of the inflammatory
pathways really start
3660.71 to create a situation in
the muscle and in the body
3664.09 that's not so great for you.
3665.46 So it's not a hard and fast rule.
3667.69 The ax doesn't drop at 60 minutes
3670.17 but it's pretty clear
that performing this five
3672.68 to 15 sets per week, whether
or not it's in one workout
3675.7 or whether that's divided
up across multiple workouts
3678.01 is really what's going
to be most beneficial.
3679.56 And please do keep in mind
Henneman's size principle
3682.79 and the recruitment of motor units.
3684.1 And remember the better you are
3685.7 at contracting particular muscles
3687.2 in an isolating those muscles,
3688.74 the fewer sets likely you need to do
3690.91 in order to get the desired effect.
3693.3 Now, what about people who
have been training for a while?
3695.46 If you're somebody who's been doing
3696.73 weight training for a while,
the data points to the fact
3700.49 that more volume can be
beneficial, even for muscles
3703.92 that you are very
efficient at contracting.
3707.21 Now, the curve on this, the graph on this
3710.45 begins again at about five sets per week
3712.84 for maintaining a given muscle group,
3714.58 and extends all the way out
to 25 or 30 sets per week.
3719.18 However, there are individuals
who for whatever reason
3723.71 can generate so much force.
3725.3 They're so good at training muscles
3727.524 that they can generate so
much force in just four
3730.97 or six or eight sets that
doing this large volume
3734.14 of work is actually going
to be counterproductive.
3736.69 So everyone needs to
figure out for themselves.
3739.24 First of all, how often you're willing
3740.72 to do resistance exercise of any kind.
3743.22 And again, it doesn't
matter if you're using bands
3745.23 or weights or body weight.
3746.54 For instance, if you're
doing chin-ups chances are
3749.38 unless you are very strong
that you're not using weights.
3752.52 You're just using something
that you can hold onto.
3754.82 Or if you're doing pushups,
some of you will be working
3758.02 in that 30% to 80% of your
one-repetition maximum range.
3761.68 It doesn't necessarily mean
3762.94 that you have to be moving
weights in a gym for instance.
3766.26 So the purpose here is to figure out
3769.17 what muscles you're trying to train.
3770.93 That's an issue that we'll
talk about in a moment.
3773.15 And then it does appear that somewhere
3774.87 between five and 15 sets
per week is going to be
3780.19 the thing that's going
to work for most people.
3781.89 Now, this is based on a
tremendous amount of work
3783.96 that was done by Andy
Galpin and colleagues,
3785.72 Brad Schoenfeld and colleagues
and others, Mike Roberts.
3791.6 There's a huge group of people
3793.61 out there doing exercise
physiology and a small subset
3796.83 of them that are linking them
back to real-world protocols
3800.27 that don't just pertain to athletes.
3802.22 So that's mainly what
I'm focusing on today.
3804.0 And surely there will be exceptions.
3806.2 Now, if you are going to
divide the sets across the week
3810.53 you're not going to do
all 10 sets for instance
3812.56 for a given muscle group in one session,
3814.58 then of course, it's imperative
3816.17 that the muscles recover
in between sessions.
3818.24 And we are going to talk about recovery
3820.07 both at the systemic level,
the whole nervous system
3823.27 and at the local level the nerve to muscle
3826.08 and local even muscle level.
3827.82 We'll talk about that in about 10 minutes
3829.416 when we talk about recovery.
3831.58 I do want to mention
something very important
3833.59 which is that everything
I'm referring to here
3835.74 it has to do with full range of motion.
3838.8 And you might ask, well, what
about the speeds of movements?
3842.14 This is actually turns out
3843.08 to be a really interesting dataset
3845.21 for generating explosiveness and speed.
3848.03 So for sprinters or throwing sports,
3850.64 or for people that want to
generate a lot of jumping power,
3853.68 it does appear that
learning to move weights
3856.22 as fast as you safely can,
especially under moderate
3860.33 to heavy loads, can increase
explosiveness and speed.
3864.9 And most of that effect is
from changes in the neurons.
3870.29 It's not from changes in the muscle.
3871.97 It's from changes in the way
that the upper motor neurons
3874.9 communicate with the lower motor neurons
3877.25 and generating a pathway, a
neural circuit, as we call it,
3881.11 that is very efficient at
generating action potentials,
3884.49 which are the electricity within neurons
3886.38 to trigger the muscle.
3887.32 Now, of course there
are events that happen
3888.7 from nerve to muscle
3889.92 but the takeaway from that
enormous literature, frankly
3893.66 is that if you want to get faster,
3896.48 yes, it can be beneficial to get stronger.
3899.56 But if you want to dedicate
resistance training specifically
3903.07 to jumping higher, to running
faster, to throwing further
3909.38 and these sorts of things that
learning to generate force
3913.38 with increasing speed is
going to be beneficial.
3916.82 On the flip side of that
3917.98 for people that want to get stronger,
3919.69 it appears that the
slowing down of the weight
3922.03 as things get harder is a key parameter
3924.59 in recruiting those high
threshold motor units.
3927.05 So let me phrase that a
little bit differently.
3929.45 Think about a set in the gym
3931.03 or think about a set of
pushups or a set of pull-ups.
3933.61 Initially you can move
very fast if you like.
3936.78 If you want to generate hypertrophy,
3938.3 the goal really is not
necessarily to move super slow
3940.86 but to isolate the muscle
3941.693 and therefore not to use momentum rather
3943.68 than lift weights, as they
say, challenge muscles.
3946.89 If you want to get stronger,
3948.1 you're going to be
distributing that effort
3949.7 over more muscles and more
of your nervous system.
3952.32 For generating explosiveness and speed,
3955.72 it's very clear that learning
to generate forces quickly
3959.21 and to move heavy or
moderately heavy loads quickly
3963.08 is going to be beneficial
because of the way
3964.88 that you train the motor neurons.
3967.27 And of course changes in the muscle.
3969.32 But this could look different
for different sports.
3972.28 And obviously you want
to make safety paramount.
3974.31 If you're injured, you're
not going to be able
3975.66 to train at all for sport
or for any purpose that is.
3979.71 And so what this would involve
is something like 60% to 75%
3983.59 of a one-repetition maximum,
and then in a controlled way
3986.53 moving that as quickly as one
can throughout the entire set.
3990.33 And certainly not going to failure
3992.47 because as you approach failure,
3993.98 the inability to move the
weight with good form,
3996.18 the weight inevitably slows down.
3998.27 In fact, there are a lot
of new technologies now
4001.13 that are focused on informing people
4003.88 of how quickly the bar
or weight is moving.
4006.46 I saw an advertisement
for this the other day.
4008.94 There are things that
people can attach to bars
4011.46 that will literally speak to you
4012.293 as you're doing a set and inform you
4014.38 whether or not you're moving
four times more slowly per rep
4018.37 than you were at the beginning.
4019.52 And trying to hone in on
the exact speed of movement.
4022.44 In talking to these experts
prior to this episode
4025.6 it does appear that for
sake of hypertrophy,
4028.56 as long as you're not
moving the muscle so quickly
4031.41 that you start to distribute the effort
4032.98 to lots of other muscles,
4035.07 it doesn't really matter
because as the set gets harder,
4040.32 the motor units that you
recruit will increase the number
4043.76 of neurons that you recruit
4044.62 and the number of muscle
fibers and particularly
4046.47 these high threshold muscle
fibers will increase.
4048.58 And so it's really only
for purposes of hypertrophy
4051.81 that you really need to be concerned about
4054.45 how quickly the weight is slowing down.
4057.12 However, if you're trying to
get faster, more explosive
4059.9 and generate more speed and
jumping power, throwing power
4064.3 things of that sort, you never
really want to use a weight
4067.52 or get to a portion of the set
4069.21 where you're moving the
bar very, very slowly.
4071.39 And I'm sure as I say that some
4072.62 of the exercise physiologists
4073.81 and advanced trainers out there will come
4075.64 after me with pitchforks, which is fine.
4077.32 I'd love to see the literature that shows
4078.95 that low gear slow movements
with very heavy weights
4081.87 can indeed improve explosiveness.
4084.75 And that may in fact be the case,
4086.48 but the data that I was able
to access was essentially
4089.21 as I described just a moment ago.
4091.01 So as you're probably
starting to realize you need
4092.79 to customize a resistance practice
4096.33 for your particular needs and goals.
4098.35 And I certainly am not
the first to suggest
4101.1 that people periodize their training.
4103.15 That they do things from anywhere
4104.25 from one month to six months,
and to see how it goes
4106.757 and to make modifications as they go.
4109.38 Because the nervous system in particular
4111.43 the neuromuscular system
changes very quickly
4114.22 at the beginning of training.
4115.39 In fact, some of the
changes that one can see
4117.93 when they first embrace or
start resistance training
4123.15 can be very remarkable, but
they tend to slow over time.
4126.43 So we've talked about a few principles.
4127.89 The fact that you need
to get sufficient volume,
4129.82 you need at least five sets to maintain
4131.44 and you probably need about
10 sets per muscle group
4133.58 in order to improve muscle.
4135.4 That moving weights of moderate
4136.9 to moderately heavy weight quickly
4139.16 is going to be best for explosiveness.
4140.65 The isolating muscles and
really contracting muscles hard
4144.43 something that you can test by just
4146.47 when you're outside the training session,
4148.19 seeing whether or not you
can cramp the muscle hard
4151.3 will tell you your capacity
to improve hypertrophy
4155.07 or to engage strength
changes in that muscle.
4158.09 That your ability to
contract a muscle hard is
4161.01 inversely related to the number
of sets that you should do
4164.1 in order to isolate and
stimulate that muscle.
4167.62 And there are some other
things that can enhance
4170.52 the whole process of building
nerve to muscle connections,
4174.26 making them more efficient
and generating if you like
4176.78 more strength and hypertrophy.
4179.12 One of them I loath to say I was told
4183.74 is in between set contractions.
4186.62 The other name for this is the people
4188.56 in the gym does typically
seem to be guys in the gym
4192.29 flexing their muscles in between sets.
4194.47 And indeed the research supports the fact
4197.68 that contractions have about 30 seconds
4200.25 in between the actual work sets,
4202.27 they're not going to
favor better performance
4205.32 on the work sets, if anything
4206.207 they're going to compromise them.
4207.89 But those hard contractions
in between sets
4210.72 for a variety of reasons related
to local muscle metabolism
4214.45 as well as what we talked about before
4216.1 which are stress, tension, and damage,
4218.09 they seem to improve
stress, tension, and damage
4220.92 and the nerve to muscle contraction
4222.49 in ways that facilitate hypertrophy.
4224.5 In other words, if you
see that person flexing
4227.02 in between sets in the gym,
4228.72 provided that they're
really isolating that muscle
4231.49 and provided it's one that
they ought to be improving,
4235.26 not one of these people
4236.38 that always skips leg day type of people.
4238.07 These people are highly asymmetric
4240.83 although that's up to them,
4242.56 that process of flexing
in between sets does seem
4246.29 to improve the nerve to muscle connection
4248.9 and enhance hypertrophy.
4251.05 And I say I was low to say it
because nowadays with phones
4254.07 it seems like the end of
every set includes a selfie
4258.5 sort of like the 11th rep of every set.
4260.35 I like to joke.
4261.183 It seems like very few people
are capable of actually going
4263.67 into the gym and doing a workout
4265.91 without taking a picture of themselves,
4267.15 which I think is fine
if that's your thing.
4270.06 Although I must say that
the athletes that I know
4273.01 and even the recreational
athletes that I know
4275.27 who seem to get the most
out of their training
4277.54 and who also seem to get the most out
4279.13 of other aspects of their life,
4280.32 seem to be able to control
their phone behavior
4282.18 both in the gym and outside of the gym.
4284.14 But that's more of an
editorial point there.
4286.92 In an earlier episode,
4288.05 I talked about estrogen and testosterone.
4290.76 And during that discussion, I talked about
4292.67 the use of resistance
exercise specifically
4295.37 for increasing testosterone,
both in men and in women.
4299.31 And indeed that is a powerful
effect of resistance exercise.
4304.13 And indeed it's mediated by the
nerve to muscle connections.
4308.68 We talked about that in
that earlier episode.
4311.27 I just want to briefly
mention that protocol
4313.14 since it's distinctly different
4314.64 from the other protocols
I've talked about today.
4317.03 The protocols I've talked
about today thus far
4319.87 of explosive movements or of
hypertrophy-based training
4324.47 provided the training
is 60 minutes or less
4327.52 will cause increases in serum testosterone
4330.41 that's been shown over and over again.
4332.97 And if the session extends
too long, past 75 minutes
4336.61 and is of sufficiently
high intensity chances are
4339.65 testosterone levels will start to drop
4342.01 and cortisol levels will go up
4344.43 in ways that can be
detrimental to recovery
4346.5 and the goals of the training.
4348.72 But that's different than training
4351.14 that's specifically geared
toward increasing testosterone.
4354.79 Duncan French, who's one of the directors
4356.81 of the UFC Performance Center,
4358.77 when he was a graduate student
4360.25 at University of Connecticut
Stores did some beautiful work.
4363.09 He and his colleagues found
the ideal training protocols
4366.69 for stimulating testosterone release
4368.81 which is something that
many people want to do
4370.91 for a variety of reasons.
4372.62 And that involved doing
six sets of 10 repetitions
4378.88 even if it requires lightening the weight
4382.27 on one set to the next,
with about two minutes
4386.06 120 seconds rest in between sets.
4388.29 Which if you think of about
it is pretty short rest
4392.58 and is pretty darn hard work.
4395.53 Now, what's interesting is that
4396.83 there's a very limited threshold
4398.78 for increasing testosterone.
4400.16 That protocol of six sets
of 10 repetitions led
4405.11 to these big increases
in serum testosterone.
4408.01 But if people did 10 sets of 10
4409.9 so just four more repetitions per set,
4412.29 then testosterone did not increase.
4414.47 In fact, you got more of this
4415.56 catabolic cortisol like pathway.
4417.33 You get other benefits from this
4419.25 so-called 10 sets of 10 protocol,
4421.2 but not the testosterone increase
4423.08 and maybe even reductions in testosterone.
4425.99 Now, it's important to point out that
4427.09 that six sets of 10 was done
with big compound movements.
4430.33 So things like squats,
or deadlifts, or chin-ups
4433.06 or things of that sort.
4434.14 And those were done as single sessions
4436.38 not in concert with a bunch
of other exercise, although
4440.517 if athletes are doing
that, there's no reason
4443.0 why they couldn't also do other types
4444.6 of training elsewhere in the week.
4446.78 I asked Duncan about this
and he mentioned that
4448.43 that done twice a week
is probably the maximum
4451.4 that anyone could do that
4454.19 and still maintain this
increase in testosterone.
4456.57 It's a very interesting protocol
4458.63 because as a neuroscientist, it's amazing
4462.75 to me that six sets of 10
repetitions with something,
4468.217 causes a distinctly different result
4470.35 in terms of hormone output
4472.0 than 10 sets of 10 of
the exact same movement.
4474.95 And it speaks to the
exquisite way in which nerve
4478.68 to muscle connections
dictate the whole physiology
4482.5 of your entire system.
4484.01 If there's a theme that I really
want to bring forward today
4486.56 is that weight training or
resistance training of any kind
4490.41 is really used for
either systemic effects.
4493.74 10% of training done where
you're feeling that burn
4496.18 which means lactate will be present
4497.92 and sending signals to your brain,
4499.45 and your heart and your
liver that are beneficial
4501.97 or isolating muscles
which may also generate
4505.25 a kind of a lactate which is
associated with the burn result
4510.55 but that isolation of
muscles distinctly different.
4513.1 So systemic versus isolated.
4515.28 Those are the two general ways
4517.03 in which resistance
training can be applied.
4519.62 So I just wanted to mention
that earlier protocol
4521.5 because it's well supported
by the literature.
4524.39 If you were to incorporate that protocol,
4526.7 you might ask, well, then can you do any
4528.33 other weight training during the week?
4529.65 And sure, of course you can
provided you're recovering.
4532.41 So let's talk about how you
know if you're recovering.
4535.36 How you know if a muscle is recovered
4537.0 and how you know if your
whole system is recovered.
4539.5 Because recovery is what
dictates whether or not
4542.045 you can come back and do more
work of a different kind.
4544.82 Meaning, I don't know, you
do a leg training one day,
4548.43 can you and should you come back
4549.94 and do the upper body training day?
4552.35 And it dictates whether or
not you'll see any improvement
4555.14 from session to session at all.
4557.03 Before I talk about recovery
4558.31 I just want to make sure
I nailed down the details
4560.48 that I was able to extract
from the literature
4563.19 and from my conversation with Dr. Galpin.
4565.61 If you're wondering how
quickly to perform repetitions
4568.95 for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains,
4571.52 anywhere from a half a
second per repetition
4574.12 all the way up to eight
seconds per repetition,
4576.2 it doesn't seem to matter.
4578.26 Again, if you're thinking
about explosiveness
4580.17 or building speed, or you're specifically
4582.19 using resistance training
to build endurance,
4584.5 that's a separate matter.
4585.42 We talked about explosiveness and speed.
4587.21 I'll talk about endurance
in a few moments.
4589.42 We also talked about in
between set contractions
4592.407 the so called selfie effect
4594.78 of people flexing a particular muscle,
4596.97 isolating a particular
muscle between sets,
4599.38 just want to mention that
would be a terrible thing to do
4602.04 if your goal is performance on sets.
4604.23 So moving a particular amount of weight.
4606.94 That's actually going to
diminish the amount of weight
4609.05 that you can move.
4610.01 It's going to enhance muscle growth
4611.678 and it's going to enhance the nerve
4613.5 to muscle isolation of
that particular pathway.
4617.08 So again, that flexing
between sets is going
4620.5 to favor hypertrophy, not performance.
4623.82 If you're trying to get stronger,
4626.23 you're trying to move more weights,
4627.59 you're trying to distribute work,
4629.14 and you're trying to
do maybe skill training
4631.07 with resistance then flexing between sets
4633.59 is absolutely the wrong thing
to do for obvious reasons
4636.56 you're fatiguing the muscle further.
4638.19 Just remaining still or
walking around a little bit
4641.15 has been shown to be beneficial in terms
4643.54 of moving some of the
lactate out of the muscle
4645.89 as well as just recovering between sets.
4648.15 Now, how long to recover
between sets, is a question.
4650.81 For the testosterone protocol,
Duncan French and colleagues
4653.68 found that it was about
two minutes keeping
4655.35 that really on the clock,
two minutes not longer.
4658.58 For hypertrophy and for strength gains,
4661.12 it does seem that resting
anywhere from two minutes
4663.76 or even three or four,
even five or six minutes
4667.17 can be beneficial.
4668.21 And if you're interested
in expanding the volume
4670.98 of work that you can do in a given session
4673.9 at high capacity at high
intensity, with a given weight,
4677.28 please see the episode that I did
4678.81 on cold and performance about
supercharging performance
4682.12 which is based on the work of my colleague
4683.64 Craig Heller in the Biology
Department at Stanford,
4686.23 which talks about Palmer Cooling,
4687.84 about how you can cool
the core of the body best
4690.59 through the palms using these
particular venous portals
4694.16 that are only present in your hands.
4696.73 People are now doing this with
ice packs or with gel packs.
4700.07 There are a number of
different ways one can do this.
4701.5 I talk all about that in that episode.
4703.26 It allows you to do more repetitions
4706.32 and more work at a given weight over time.
4709.12 So rather than getting 10 repetitions
4711.58 and then eight and then seven and then six
4713.82 through proper use of palmer cooling,
4715.85 one can do 10, 10, 10,
10, and even add sets.
4719.117 And that's one way that one can accomplish
4721.38 higher volume work without having
4724.04 to drop the weight considerably.
4725.141 So that's where you can
hit that really sweet spot
4728.06 if that's your goal of getting strong
4730.27 and generating some hypertrophy.
4732.24 Because as soon as you have
to drop to lighter weights,
4736.21 then you're shifting
more towards hypertrophy
4738.337 and endurance and less toward
strength of any given muscle.
4741.47 So check out that episode.
4743.27 The last thing besides
between set contractions
4746.69 and whether or not
you're distributing work
4748.76 or whether or not you're really
trying to isolate muscles
4751.35 is this notion of pre-exhausting muscles.
4754.37 It's been shown over and over again
4756.369 that for instance, if you
want to generate force
4760.4 in a given muscle and really isolate that,
4762.48 doing the isolation work
before a compound movement.
4765.19 So this would be leg extensions
4768.09 the thing where you sit
4768.923 and you extend your toes
up toward the ceiling.
4771.4 Leg extensions before
squats will allow the squats
4775.09 to target that muscle
group more effectively.
4777.5 And that makes perfectly
good sense based on
4780.174 the Henneman's size principle
and fatiguing motor units.
4783.06 It should be obvious why that's the case.
4784.81 But of course that's going
to be anti performance
4788.33 in terms of how much weight you can lift,
4790.05 and maybe even the form
that you can maintain
4791.75 when you move to the
bigger compound movement.
4793.81 So you really have to ask
yourself a number of questions.
4796.16 How good are you at
isolating a given muscle?
4799.03 Therefore, how many
sets do you want to do?
4801.2 How often are you willing to train
4803.73 therefore, how many
sets are you going to do
4805.54 in a given session versus
how many are you going
4807.74 to distribute across the week?
4809.49 Are you aiming for performance?
4810.92 Are you going to distribute that work
4812.48 across the nervous system and musculature?
4814.55 Are you trying to move weights?
4815.71 Are you trying to challenge muscles?
4817.21 If you're trying to challenge muscles,
4818.83 then you really want to focus on things
4820.66 like this pre exhausting the isolation
4822.55 of a muscle before the compound movement.
4824.58 Your performance on compound movements
4826.41 will absolutely suffer but your ability
4829.42 to isolate that muscle
and generate hypertrophy
4831.529 through the accumulation of larger myosin,
4834.41 those bigger balloons, will benefit.
4836.95 And once again, if you're
trying to get faster
4839.54 than the speed of the
movement really matters.
4842.48 So how do we know if we've recovered?
4843.99 How can we test recovery?
4845.6 And this is not just recovery
from resistance training,
4847.98 this is recovery from running,
recovery from swimming.
4851.27 Up until now I've been talking
about resistance training
4853.22 more or less in a vacuum.
4854.72 I haven't even touched on the fact
4856.78 that many people are running
4857.97 and they're doing resistance training
4859.44 or they're swimming and they're
doing resistance training.
4862.55 It's not simply the case that
if a given muscle is fatigued
4866.11 you can just work other muscles.
4867.62 Because even if you've
beautifully isolated a muscle,
4871.44 let's say you have incredible abilities
4873.42 to isolate just your
quadriceps for instance
4877.02 and you do a workout where
you isolate your quadriceps
4879.34 you do your six sets of intense work
4881.04 or maybe use palmer cooling,
4882.28 and you're able to do
12 sets of intense work
4884.82 and you're done, and that muscle group
4888.71 the next day is certainly
not going to be recovered
4890.67 unless you're somebody who's
extraordinary at recovery
4893.27 or you're enhancing your
recovery through chemical means
4896.06 which we'll talk about at the end.
4898.08 Well, you can assess systemic recovery
4901.61 meaning your nervous system.
4903.7 And your nervous system's
ability to generate force
4906.98 both distributed and isolated
through three main tests.
4911.31 And fortunately, these
tests are very simple
4914.31 and two of them are essentially zero cost,
4917.46 require no equipment.
4919.88 HRV, heart rate variability
has made its way finally
4924.67 into the forefront of exercise physiology
4927.24 and even into the popular discussion.
4929.42 I've talked about HRV before.
4931.32 How when we exhale, our
heart rate slows down
4933.47 because of the way that our diaphragm
4934.71 is connected to our heart and to our brain
4936.48 and the way our brain is
connected to our heart.
4938.92 When we inhale our heart rate speeds up
4941.43 and that is the basis of
heart rate variability.
4944.01 Heart rate variability is good.
4946.21 It means that you're breathing properly,
4948.52 and when I say it's good it means
4950.31 you want a lot of heart rate variability.
4952.35 You don't want a heart rate that is high
4954.91 or low consistently over time.
4957.28 That might come as a bit
of a surprise for you
4959.23 endurance athletes,
who probably are trying
4961.15 to accomplish your endurance
work at a steady cadence
4964.2 to really hit that nice sweet spot
4965.69 where you're breathing rhythmically,
4967.09 your heart rate's going rhythmically.
4968.36 You're in that steady heart rate,
4969.85 and then away from exercise,
4971.02 you have a nice low
heart rate as they say.
4973.26 Well, nice low heart rate isn't
necessarily always so nice.
4976.92 Turns out the introducing bouts
4978.58 of increasing your heart
rate during exercise
4980.6 and even through your waking day,
4982.39 through stressful events
even is provided their brief
4984.993 is beneficial.
4986.45 A good nerve to heart system benefits
4990.8 from being able to increase heart rate
4992.53 and decrease heart rate.
4993.47 Heart rate variability is good.
4995.81 So you don't want high heart rate,
4997.01 you don't want low
heart rate all the time.
5000.0 But heart rate variability is difficult
5001.98 for a lot of people to measure.
5003.32 There are some devices that
will allow you to do that.
5005.42 Various watches and devices.
5007.97 There are more devices becoming
available all the time.
5011.14 Hopefully soon, some that are integrated
5012.77 with your phone that involve no contact
5014.75 or anything on your body.
5016.7 But those do carry some costs
and they are not perfect yet.
5021.33 The measures of heart rate
variability that one can use
5024.24 while in movement are still in that phase
5027.88 I would say of technology development
5029.31 where everyone isn't using
them, let's leave it at that.
5032.37 There are two measures however,
5033.62 whether or not you
recovered that you can use
5035.52 first thing in the
morning when you wake up,
5037.69 maybe after five, 10 minutes, if you like,
5039.67 but ideally right when you wake up
5042.06 in order to assess how
well recovered you are
5044.76 and therefore whether
or not you should train
5046.71 your whole system at all that day.
5049.04 The first one his grip strength.
5051.957 Grip strength, the
ability to generate force
5055.5 at the level of squeezing the fist
5057.26 or squeezing down on something,
5059.52 might seem like kind of a trivial way
5061.44 to assess recovery but
it's not because it relates
5063.98 to your ability to use
your upper motor neurons
5066.73 to control your lower motor neurons
5068.28 and to generate isolated force.
5070.76 So that's really what you're
assessing when you do that.
5073.56 Some people will use
one of these grip tools
5077.67 or Costello has this toy
that's shaped like a donut
5081.67 and it's this hard rubber.
5083.77 And I've tried this before.
5085.11 If I've been working really
hard, not sleeping very well,
5087.69 or I've been training a lot
5088.8 any one or combination of
those things, my grip suffers.
5091.58 I can't actually squeeze that thing down
5093.33 as much as I can Costello
because he was born
5095.52 with like a 24 inch neck
5097.046 even though he's never touched a weight
5099.3 somehow he can just
clamp down on that thing,
5101.38 and he can turn it into
a pancake with ease
5103.72 and he likes to chuckle while
I struggle with this thing.
5106.08 But on a good day, I
can squeeze this thing
5107.68 so that I eliminate the hole
in the donut so to speak.
5110.28 You can also take a floor
scale and squeeze the scale
5116.39 and see how much force you can generate.
5118.49 I would do that as a baseline to establish
5120.83 what you can do when you're well rested.
5123.01 And then if you do that in the morning,
5124.22 you can see whether or not you're able
5125.67 to generate the same amount of force
5127.44 or you could use over the
rubber donut or something.
5129.41 A lot of this is very subjective
5130.82 with a scale you're
really trying to assess
5132.8 whether or not you can generate
the same amount of force.
5135.1 If you start seeing a 10% or
20% certainly reduction in that
5139.1 that's concerning, it
means that your system,
5141.29 your nervous system as a whole
5143.23 it's not necessarily
fatigued, is that the pathways
5146.72 from nerve to muscle
are still in the process
5149.64 of rewiring themselves in
order to generate force.
5152.75 And you might think, well, I
train one muscle group one day.
5155.15 Why am I having a hard time doing this
5156.62 for a completely different muscle group?
5158.18 It doesn't make any sense.
5159.39 But there's something about
the upper motor neuron
5161.48 to lower motor neuron pathway generally
5164.07 that allows you to use
something like grip strength
5166.44 as a kind of a thermometer, if you will
5169.17 of your ability to recover.
5171.14 So look for your ability
to generate force in grip
5173.57 when you first wake up.
5174.87 It's not going to be as
good as it is at 3:00 PM
5177.37 after a cup of coffee and a couple meals
5179.76 but the point isn't performance overall,
5182.69 the point is to assess whether or not
5184.1 you're getting better, worse
or the same from day to day.
5187.21 The other one that's really terrific
5188.56 and the Andy Galpin's group is using.
5190.64 And I'm delighted about
this because it relates
5192.66 to something that my lab is
very excited about as well
5194.95 is carbon dioxide tolerance.
5196.95 So this is a really interesting tool
5198.73 that endurance athletes, strength athletes
5201.74 I think can all benefit from.
5203.16 In fact athletes and people of all kinds.
5205.166 Even if you're not an athlete,
5206.64 even if you're not exercising at all,
5208.4 there's a good question of
whether or not your system
5210.3 as a whole is doing okay or not.
5213.51 We rely on the thermometer.
5214.87 Do we have a fever or not?
5216.09 We rely on subjective things.
5218.04 Do I feel good or not?
5219.4 Am I digesting well or not?
5220.74 Those are all subjective.
5222.93 The carbon dioxide tolerance test is,
5226.48 its objective in that it
measures your capacity
5229.95 to engage the so-called
parasympathetic arm
5232.27 of your nervous system
which is the calming aspect
5234.63 of your nervous system.
5235.48 And it measures your ability
to consciously control
5238.73 a particular skeletal muscle,
which is your diaphragm.
5241.89 So here's how you do the
carbon dioxide tolerance test.
5244.56 You wake up in the morning.
5245.77 If you have to use the
restroom first, do that,
5247.84 but try and stay away from your phone.
5250.29 If you have your phone,
put it on airplane mode,
5252.44 go to the timer or use a
hand watch or some other way
5255.52 of measuring time, stay off social media
5259.27 for just a few seconds.
5260.54 It'll be okay.
5261.81 And what you're going to do
is you're going to inhale
5263.99 through your nose as deeply as you can,
5265.9 you can do this lying
down, sitting, whatever
5269.36 inhale through your nose
and then exhale all the way.
5274.05 So that's one.
5274.94 You're going to repeat that four times.
5277.31 So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
5282.05 inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale four times.
5285.14 And ideally you're
inhaling through the nose
5287.56 and you're exhaling through the mouth.
5289.09 That's just the beginning
5290.84 of this carbon dioxide tolerance test.
5293.38 Then you take a fifth inhale
5295.66 as deep as you can through your nose.
5297.34 Fill your lungs as much as you can,
5299.095 and if you can try and expand
5302.31 make your stomach go
out while you do that,
5303.92 that means that your
diaphragm has really engaged.
5306.04 So you're inhaling as
much as you possibly can.
5309.1 Then hit the timer and
your goal is to release
5312.9 that air as slowly as
possible through your mouth.
5316.94 So it looks like you have
a tiny, tiny little straw
5319.57 in your mouth and you're letting it go.
5324.35 As slowly as you possibly can.
5327.0 Measure what we call the
carbon dioxide blow off time
5330.73 or discard rate.
5333.74 I know you can all sit with lungs empty
5335.71 after you eliminate all that
air, but don't lie to yourself.
5339.9 Don't stop the timer
when you've been sitting
5342.59 with your lungs empty for a while,
5344.1 stop the timer when you
are finally no longer
5347.41 able to exhale any more air.
5351.176 So you do inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
5353.35 inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly.
5356.01 I just said it quickly for sake of time
5358.01 then you can do this fifth
big inhale through your mouth,
5361.63 and then [deep exhale]
5364.99 And I'm not going to do
it for the full duration.
5368.44 And then you're measuring that time.
5370.54 Your carbon dioxide discard
rate will be somewhere
5374.88 between one second and
presumably two minutes.
5379.36 Two minutes would be a heroic
carbon oxide discard time.
5383.46 30 seconds would be more typical.
5385.43 20 seconds would be fast.
5387.8 If your carbon dioxide discard time
5391.24 is 20 or 25 seconds or less,
5395.55 you are not necessarily recovered
5398.63 from your previous days activities.
5401.55 There's ways to push through this
5402.9 but hold onto that thought for a moment.
5405.18 If your carbon oxide
discard time is somewhere
5407.89 between about 30 seconds and 60 seconds,
5412.976 you are in what we would
call kind of the green zone
5416.84 where you are in a position
to do more physical work.
5422.08 And if your carbon dioxide
discard time is somewhere
5424.61 between 65 and 120 seconds,
5428.52 well then you have almost certainly
5431.1 recovered your nervous system.
5433.16 I'm not talking about
the individual muscles
5434.65 but your nervous system is
prepared to do more work.
5437.7 And Andy's Lab has great data on this
5440.11 as it relates to exercise physiology.
5441.92 I think that story should be out
5443.07 in the not too distant future.
5444.84 My lab has been using
carbon oxide discard time
5447.4 to look at anxiety and
recovery from bouts of anxiety.
5450.66 So two totally independent projects
5452.97 but using the same measure.
5454.71 So you've got HRV, which
requires some technology usually.
5458.12 You've got grip strength,
5459.71 which you can assess subjectively
5462.25 or you can use a floor scale
5464.6 and now you have carbon dioxide tolerance.
5466.8 You want to do this in the
morning when you wake up
5469.92 and keep track just write
down in a little book,
5472.47 or maybe just keep tracking your mind
5473.89 of your carbon oxide discard time.
5475.86 If you find that your
discard times are dropping
5479.17 even if they're in the
42nd range or 52nd range,
5482.81 but normally you can do
75 seconds or 120 seconds.
5486.41 If they're starting to drop
by anywhere from 15% to 20%,
5490.88 you're veering in the
direction of not recovering.
5493.48 And I'm really keen on this tool
5495.71 because everybody has
different recovery abilities.
5498.87 Some people are eating really
well and sleeping really well.
5501.3 Some people have minimal stress
5502.61 or can buffer stress really well.
5504.85 Other people they dissolve
into a puddle of tears
5508.88 if they read one text message
that's troubling or whatever.
5513.8 And I realize, and I
say that with sympathy,
5515.48 I realize people have
varying levels of stress
5517.25 and demand in their life.
5518.56 It's just to to prescribe
an entire protocol
5522.43 that says, okay, yes
you should train today
5523.84 and this is exactly what you should do.
5525.5 No, you shouldn't.
5526.333 Use carbon dioxide discard rate because a,
5528.87 it's valuable, it's informative.
5530.94 b, it's zero cost and c,
5535.02 it's something you can
track objectively over time.
5537.46 And that's really the key.
5538.78 And I'd be remiss if I didn't say
5541.83 that what carbon dioxide
discard rate is tapping into
5545.04 is your ability to mechanically
control your diaphragm
5548.04 certainly that's one aspect of it,
5550.15 but that relates in a very
direct way to your ability
5553.38 to put the brake on your stress system.
5556.75 To engage the so-called parasympathetic
5559.17 or calming arm of your
autonomic nervous system.
5561.94 And another thing that Andy
Galpin's group is testing
5565.53 is at the offset of
training after your run,
5569.01 after your weight training session,
5570.89 maybe even after your plyometrics session,
5573.58 we didn't really talk
about jumping and throwing
5575.95 and that sort of thing.
5577.21 Maybe we'll talk about
it in a future episode.
5579.66 But they and other groups,
including some elite athletes
5584.89 and other groups that are very interested
5586.67 in physical performance are using a tool
5590.23 where they deliberately disengaged
5592.78 for five minutes at the end of training.
5594.77 They deliberately engage this
calming or parasympathetic arm
5598.62 of the nervous system.
5599.67 And you can do that through
any number of different tools.
5602.08 I'm a big fan of respiration tools
5604.49 'cause they're always available to you.
5605.78 Your breathing is always there.
5607.53 I talk about some of these
tools in previous episodes
5609.85 but you could use things like
non sleep deep rest and SDR
5612.83 at the end of a training session.
5614.28 You could do 10 physiological size,
5617.29 double inhales through the
nose followed by long exhales,
5620.22 that will definitely engage the
5621.47 parasympathetic nervous
system at the end of training.
5624.69 So rather than finish
your training session
5626.6 and then just hop onto your phone,
5629.68 serious athletes and people
who are serious about recovery
5632.72 initiate that recovery at the
very end of their training
5636.72 and they start to kickstart
that recovery process rather
5640.55 and they measure CO2
tolerance in the morning.
5642.47 So there are several
groups that are doing that.
5644.21 In fact, I know several
groups because I'm working
5647.35 with them that are using
physiological size between sets
5651.02 in order to recover their nervous system
5652.91 and maintain nerve to
muscle contractibility.
5656.36 Maintain focus throughout
their training session
5658.95 enhance their focus by doing
a few physiological size.
5662.24 So double inhale, exhale in between sets.
5665.19 So they're getting very
focused and very intense
5667.8 about their strength work
or explosiveness worker,
5669.77 muscle isolation work during their sets.
5671.43 And then in between sets,
they're deliberately
5673.81 disengaging the nervous system,
5675.32 and then they're re-engaging it again.
5677.62 So I just wanted to emphasize that.
5679.53 So recovery is a complex process.
5681.56 It's got a lot of things
5683.0 but the CO2 tolerance set
should be a valuable tool.
5686.15 Now, another tool for recovery
5687.81 that people are very excited about
5689.5 is the use of cold and the ice bath.
5691.57 And this is important.
5693.01 If you are somebody who uses
cold through cold shower,
5696.5 or ice bath, or jumping
in a lake, or a river
5699.33 whatever it is that used to generate cold
5701.28 as a recovery tool, you should be aware
5703.66 that there are data
starting to emerge that
5705.73 if your goal is recovery
or strength improvements,
5709.07 using cold within the four
hours following a workout.
5713.06 I'm not talking about
palmer cooling, I'm talking
5714.533 about whole body cooling or
cooling from the neck down.
5717.98 Yes, it will reduce inflammation.
5719.88 Yes, it will reduce the amount
5721.74 of delayed on muscle soreness one readout
5724.61 of how intense or damaging
a given workout was
5727.1 not the only readout,
5728.69 but it does seem to interfere with some
5730.92 of the things like mTOR pathways,
5732.68 the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway
5734.8 and other pathways
related to an inflammation
5738.11 that promote muscle
repair and muscle growth.
5741.48 Remember, stress, tension, and damage
5743.93 or the stimulus for nerve to
muscle connections to change
5746.547 and for muscles to get
bigger, stronger, and better.
5749.26 And so if you're getting into
the ice bath after training
5752.18 or taking a really cold shower
5753.59 after doing resistance training,
5755.35 you are likely short-circuiting
the improvements
5758.05 that you're trying to create.
5759.62 Now, athletes who are
trying to recover quickly
5763.22 so that they can get back
into more training sessions,
5766.13 or let's say you're
somebody who doesn't really
5767.82 want to gain much strength or hypertrophy
5772.08 and you're mainly focused on endurance
5773.91 and you want to do more endurance work
5775.36 and you've been weight training,
5776.22 well then exposing yourself
to cold can be beneficial,
5779.05 but you're not going to
get as great of benefits
5781.75 from the resistance training.
5783.52 In other words, cold
after resistance training
5785.69 seems to short circuit
some of the benefits
5787.59 of that resistance training.
5789.12 There are some other things
5790.07 that can short circuit the benefits
5791.65 of resistance training as well.
5794.21 One of those is anti-histamines.
5797.01 Some interesting data
were published recently.
5798.978 I believe it was in
scientific reports, yes
5801.95 that showed that
anti-histamines can prevent some
5806.23 of the benefits of cardiovascular exercise
5808.9 of endurance type work
as running, swimming
5811.18 of fairly long duration
or even sprint type work,
5813.89 as well as inhibit some of
the processes associated
5816.96 with resistance training.
5819.21 Remember, it resistance
training or endurance training,
5821.88 that's a stimulus for stress
5824.28 and the adaptation to that
stress is how you get better.
5827.43 That you can run further, faster,
5828.88 lift more weight, hypertrophy
the muscle, et cetera.
5832.73 So anti-histamines can be a problem.
5834.34 Obviously don't compromise your ability
5836.07 to breathe completely, but
anti-histamines generally work
5839.87 by blocking what are called
mast cells and M-A-S-T.
5842.96 Mast cells are really interesting cells
5844.62 that we'll talk about in our
month on neuro immune function.
5847.95 They travel in the bloodstream
5849.22 and these little packets that burst open
5851.16 it sites of inflammation.
5853.5 Muscle damage and inflammation is a signal
5856.23 that something needs to change.
5857.66 And so taking it to histamines
it appears can disrupt
5861.0 some of that inflammatory process.
5862.65 So you actually want inflammation
5864.17 during and immediately after a workout,
5866.11 then you want to bring
inflammation down later
5868.93 and I'll mention how to do that.
5870.31 The other thing are non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs
5872.99 you know their trade names.
5874.26 These are painkillers
that many people take.
5876.51 Those as I've mentioned
in a previous episode
5878.36 can interfere with the
benefits of endurance training
5881.96 and the benefits of resistance training.
5884.0 In addition to that,
they block pain signals
5886.29 and pain is a very good signal
5889.09 that you might be doing something wrong.
5891.15 And so while nobody likes to be in pain,
5893.54 I suppose there are probably
a few people out there
5894.88 like to be in pain, but
that's a different story
5896.61 but nobody likes to be in pain.
5898.42 The non-steroid
anti-inflammatory the NSAIDs
5900.87 as they're called, and
the anti-histamines seem
5903.35 to prevent a lot of the gains
5905.39 the improvements in
endurance, strength and size
5908.37 that people are specifically
using exercise for.
5911.66 So be cautious about your use
5913.36 of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
5915.98 especially within the four hours preceding
5918.51 or the four hours following exercise.
5921.56 So I hope you're starting
to get the picture.
5923.33 In order to change the
nerve to muscle connectivity
5926.05 in ways that will better serve you,
5927.849 you need a stressor
during the actual training
5931.87 which particular stressor
depends on your training goals.
5934.77 But that stressor is almost always going
5937.92 to be associated with inflammation,
5939.372 and then after the
training, you want to try
5941.41 and get into a state of
reduced inflammation.
5943.62 And that's why you would
do some sort of protocol
5947.03 non sleep depressed which we
will link to in our caption
5949.79 or perhaps you would use the hypnosis app
5952.33 that we've talked about before
Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
5956.84 There's a great app for
accessing deep rest states
5960.5 or the physiological side
to try and get your system
5964.06 to calm down after training.
5967.12 There are also tools that one
can use to reduce inflammation
5970.78 at a kind of foundational
level away from training.
5973.72 And these are tools that I've talked
5975.61 about many times before, but
I'll just restate them again.
5979.56 The kind of Golden Three
according to Andy Galpin
5982.16 and the ones that he recommends are
5983.87 sufficient omega-3s again,
that can be accomplished
5986.52 through diet, through whole food intake
5988.59 or through supplementation or both.
5990.39 So in general, getting
above a 1,000 milligrams
5992.89 of EPA per day to keep
inflammation low or relatively low.
5997.61 Vitamin D and in some
cases, magnesium malate.
6001.97 Magnesium malate seems to
be particularly effective
6004.35 in offsetting delayed
onset muscle soreness.
6007.63 Soreness itself is not required
6010.09 for improvements in strength,
improvements in explosiveness,
6013.89 improvements in hypertrophy.
6015.71 That's a myth.
6016.543 Now, if you do experience
delayed onset muscle soreness,
6019.29 chances are you stressed that
particular muscle pretty well
6023.3 or even maybe to well, maybe
you stressed it too much
6026.29 and you need longer recovery.
6028.46 There's a total debate
out there about whether
6030.96 or not you should train again
when a muscle is still sore.
6033.41 I think the general takeaway is, no
6034.94 that means it's not recovered.
6036.21 And there are things
of course like massage,
6038.71 like fascial release
and things of that sort
6041.08 sauna, cold that can perhaps
accelerate the movement
6047.12 from soreness to not sore.
6049.4 But in general, the omega-3, vitamin D,
6051.66 and magnesium malate trio
seemed to be an effective way
6055.85 to reduce inflammation at
kind of a systemic level.
6058.53 But remember you want
inflammation provided
6060.52 you're not damaging the muscles so much
6061.89 that you're injured during
the training session
6064.2 because that's the stimulus
for change in those muscles.
6068.35 I want to talk about a few other things
6070.25 that support the process of
nerve to muscle communication
6073.195 and touch on some of the things that a lot
6075.85 of people are doing to try
to "enhance their workouts"
6079.23 and evaluate whether or not those are
6080.82 in fact enhancing workouts or not.
6083.48 Because weight training,
unlike a lot of other forms
6086.97 of exercise has a unique aspect to it,
6090.95 which is this feature
that I guess some people
6093.33 call it the pump which is
the fact that blood goes
6095.72 into the muscle when you
train, it's the only gun
6098.35 of training where you
actually get a window
6100.01 into what the result
might actually look like
6102.76 before you actually
accomplish that result.
6104.56 So if you think about when
you go out for a hard run
6106.56 and let's say you go
out for a two mile run,
6109.27 let's say your goal is to break
6110.97 you want to do a sub ten two mile.
6112.5 Actually, when I went to university
6114.75 I was running cross country,
my senior year of high school
6117.94 and I wanted to walk on
for the cross country team.
6121.43 And so I went out there and turned out
6123.76 you had to do a sub 10, two mile.
6126.43 And I think the best mile
I ever ran in high school
6129.41 was a 457, which isn't terrible.
6131.35 I can't do that now.
6132.67 It's not even close to what
6134.638 the best high school athletes can do now.
6137.16 But that would have meant
doing it back-to-back.
6139.73 So it was sub 10 minute two
mile didn't even come close.
6142.94 I told Costello this story the other day
6144.57 and he just kind of laughed at me.
6146.0 He was like, why would you
even want to run two miles?
6148.88 Because Costello is
built almost exclusively
6151.61 of these type two fast twitch muscles
6153.45 they're designed for moving objects.
6155.05 He's incredibly strong.
6156.61 He has been since he was a puppy.
6158.62 I mean that dog could
probably drag a tractor
6161.12 if he wanted to, but
he can't really go far.
6165.35 Whereas a Greyhound or a Whippet
6166.631 or some of these other
sight hounds or scent hounds
6168.8 can go, go, go.
6169.633 They have a higher percentage of the
6170.6 so-called slow-twitch muscle fibers.
6172.81 They are much better at endurance.
6175.03 So a sub-10 two mile would have
been very, very challenging,
6178.83 no chance I could have done that.
6181.35 I don't think even with a lot of training.
6183.35 But let's say that you want
to improve your performance
6188.3 in a given type of exercise.
6189.77 Let's talk about some of
the things that seem to work
6192.37 across the board to improve
strength, improve hypertrophy,
6197.05 and improve nerve to muscle
communication and performance.
6200.72 The first thing that's absolutely key
6202.64 for nerve to muscle communication
and physical performance
6205.89 of any kind might not
sound that exciting to you
6208.63 but it is very exciting.
6210.75 And that's salt.
6213.307 Nerves cells, neurons
communicate with each other
6216.56 and communicate with
muscle by electricity.
6219.84 But that electricity is generated
by particular ions moving
6223.53 into and out of the neuron.
6225.16 And the rushing in of a
particular ion, sodium, salt
6230.38 is what allows nerve cells to fire.
6232.89 If you don't have enough
salt in your system
6235.88 your neurons and your brain and your nerve
6237.74 to muscle communication will be terrible.
6240.62 If you have sufficient
salt, it will be excellent.
6243.72 How much salt will depend on
how much water you're drinking,
6246.32 how much caffeine you're drinking,
6247.61 and how much food you're ingesting.
6249.39 And whether or not you're
taking any diuretics
6251.96 how hot it is, et cetera,
how much you're sweating.
6254.27 So you want to make sure
that you have enough salt,
6256.04 potassium and magnesium in your system
6258.16 if you want to perform well.
6259.7 I realized that salt isn't
very glamorous performance tool
6263.37 but it is a vital.
6264.8 Its absolutely vital.
6266.04 And the endurance athletes
and the people that train
6268.01 in high heat can speak to the fact that
6270.95 when your electrolytes are low,
your brain doesn't function,
6274.36 your body doesn't function nearly as well.
6276.07 In fact, even for mental
work, for studying
6279.21 and for writing and for
doing math and coding,
6282.53 doing analytic work of any kind,
6283.87 even a hard conversation
that's important to you,
6286.87 having sufficient electrolytes
is really going to help
6288.87 and being low on electrolytes won't help
6291.04 and just drinking water won't help
6292.36 because you need electrolytes.
6294.64 The other thing that's been
shown over and over again,
6297.86 a numerous well-controlled studies
6299.94 to improve muscle performance is creatine.
6303.37 Early on there was a lot of
controversy about creatine
6306.15 but there are many studies
if you want, you can go
6308.61 to this website that
everyone now knows I love
6310.9 which is this free website examined.com
6313.9 that there are no fewer
than 18 studies there.
6317.3 66 studies...
6319.35 So 18 studies supporting
that muscle creating content
6322.28 can be increased by ingesting creatine.
6324.3 How much creatine?
6325.25 Well, I asked the experts and they tell me
6328.44 that for somebody who is about 180 pounds,
6331.81 five grams a day should
be sufficient or so.
6335.16 Heavier than 180, so if you got like
6336.87 if you're a 220 pound or 230 pound person,
6339.74 10 to 15 grams of creatine.
6341.61 People lighter than 180 pounds
6343.11 maybe three to five grams of creatine
6345.9 or even one to three grams.
6347.35 Creatine is a fuel source for
early in bouts of activity
6353.34 for high intensity activity.
6354.8 It is also a fuel source
for neurons in the brain
6357.97 and it can have some
cognitive enhancing effects.
6361.62 So creatine is a very
interesting molecule.
6363.35 Early on when it was
released as a supplement,
6367.644 it was thought that you had to load it
6369.62 in higher dosages for a few days
6371.16 and then maintain it at lower dosages.
6374.21 So you'd take 20 or 30 grams a day
6376.04 then back off to five or 10.
6377.9 It doesn't seem to be the case
6379.03 that you can get all the benefits
6380.01 from taking the dosages at the low level.
6382.97 I just mentioned a few moments ago
6384.96 as they relate to body weight throughout.
6387.01 So salt and electrolytes absolutely key.
6390.29 You need those present.
6391.123 You need to be well hydrated.
6393.46 Creatine seems to have a
performance enhancing effect.
6396.56 There are 66 studies, 66
showing that power output
6401.55 is greatly increased
anywhere from 1%2 to 20%.
6406.2 And this is sprinting and running
6407.6 and jumping as well as
weightlifting by creatine.
6410.67 The ability to hydrate
your body is improved
6414.53 by creating because of the
way that it brings more water
6418.12 into cells of various kinds.
6420.41 As an indirect effect, it
can help in increasingly mass
6423.61 because of the way that it
brings more water into muscle
6425.6 and probably also because of the way that
6427.61 if you get stronger, you
can generate more force
6429.36 and generate more hypertrophy.
6431.53 It reduces fatigue.
6433.03 Seven studies have shown
that it reduces fatigue.
6436.43 There are even some interesting effects
6438.124 on improving cognition after
traumatic brain injury.
6440.65 Although that's a serious
medical condition in situations
6443.03 you absolutely should talk to
a board certified physician
6445.86 before adding anything
or taking anything out
6448.86 of your current regimen.
6451.0 There are a few other
effects that are interesting
6452.74 and notable, but the big ones
are the ones that I referred
6456.11 to before about increased
power output, et cetera.
6459.12 And I just want to emphasize
6460.94 that creatine can increase this hormone
6463.26 that we talked about in
the testosterone episode,
6465.13 dihydrotestosterone which
is testosterone converted
6469.49 by five alpha reductase
into dihydrotestosterone.
6472.71 It's the more dominant androgen in humans.
6476.24 Leads to increases in strength
and libido and so forth.
6479.28 It also can increase
male pattern baldness.
6481.67 Some people, not everybody
experience some hair loss
6484.86 with creatine other people don't.
6486.52 Some people experience
accelerated beard growth
6488.61 because basically [mumbles]
6490.48 has the opposite effect on
hair follicles on the face
6492.68 as it does on the scalp,
some people don't.
6495.41 Women who ingest creatine
6498.6 there are essentially no data showing
6500.32 that it increases hair
loss or facial hair growth,
6503.92 but of course, everyone is different.
6505.56 So you can go to examine.com.
6506.98 You can explore those studies.
6508.41 So creatine definitely a powerful
6510.55 performance enhancing molecule.
6512.28 The other one, one that
personally I've never tried
6515.13 but that seems to have a very strong
6517.83 and well-supported
effects is beta-alanine.
6521.22 Now, beta-alanine is interesting
6523.59 because when you hear
about weight training
6525.21 you think about heavy
deadlifts and bench presses
6527.22 all that kind of stuff
that people are doing.
6529.13 But beta-alanine seems to support exercise
6533.04 that is of slightly longer duration.
6535.08 So a mix of anaerobic and
aerobic type movement.
6540.074 These are physical performance
in the 60 to 242nd range.
6544.35 So you can use your mind
and kind of figure out.
6547.09 Things that weights that limit you
6549.94 to 8 to 15 repetitions.
6551.693 Cardiovascular exercise of the sort
6553.88 like rowing or sprinting.
6556.13 So interval work, it seems to
help with that kind of work.
6558.94 So we're not talking about long runs,
6560.1 we're not talking about heavy deadlifts.
6561.88 The standard dose is somewhere
between two and five grams,
6564.26 again, as always check with a doctor,
6566.36 make sure these things are safe for you.
6568.29 I'm not responsible for your health.
6569.57 You are.
6570.403 I don't say that just to protect me.
6571.48 I'd say that also to protect you
6574.29 but it really seems to
improve muscular endurance,
6578.15 improve anaerobic running
capacity, reduce fatigue.
6581.98 There are even some interesting effects
6583.09 on reduction of body fat and
improvements in lean mass.
6586.01 So creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes,
6589.35 these are kind of the core three things
6591.96 that seem to improve performance
6593.88 and are well supported by
the scientific literature.
6596.92 And in the earlier episode
on supercharging performance
6599.76 we talked about palmer cooling.
6601.21 That's certainly a
performance enhancing tool.
6603.9 It's nothing you ingest
your cooling your palms
6605.65 in a very specific way.
6607.0 That's very powerful.
6607.99 Now, what about for longer
duration bouts of exercise?
6610.45 We've mainly been focusing
on resistance training,
6612.66 but what about for long runs, long swims,
6614.94 these kinds of things?
6616.09 Well, it does seem that
juice and ingesting things
6619.33 like arginine and citrulline
can improve performance
6622.54 for those long bouts of exercise
6625.33 that's mainly going to be due to effects
6627.38 of those compounds on vasodilation.
6629.7 It's going to open up the vasculature
6631.3 and allow more blood flow.
6633.75 Do note that things like
citrulline and arginine
6636.25 can have some side effects if you will.
6639.96 They can increase the likelihood
6642.13 of having herpes cold sore
outbreaks on the mouth.
6645.86 The arginine is in the
pathway by which I don't know
6648.65 if people know this, but
the herpes virus lives
6650.67 on neurons of the trigeminal
nerve that innervates the lips
6654.12 and the eyes and the mucus
membranes of the face.
6657.57 So this is the herpes
type 1 simplex virus.
6660.07 The virus lives on those neurons
6663.51 and then periodically
inflames those neurons,
6665.93 and that's what leads to the
cold sores seems like arginine
6668.57 and citrulline can lead
to increases in cold sores
6672.35 and canker sores, and
outbreaks of those kinds.
6675.7 So you want to be aware of that.
6678.74 That's not everybody, and not
everybody is caring HSV-1,
6683.48 just be aware that I think
it's now 80% or 90% of people
6688.37 by time they're 12 years old,
they've contracted HSV-1.
6691.9 It's very contagious and
typically one outbreak,
6695.87 and then only under conditions of stress
6697.94 or heightened arginine
or citrulline ingestion
6699.96 we'll have them later.
6701.42 Again, this is not necessarily an STI,
6708.442 a sexually transmitted infection.
6709.86 This is an infection that
is passed very easily
6712.85 from mucous membranes, just
in terms of touching objects
6715.14 and things of that sort.
6716.12 Very common in the general population.
6719.01 Any discussion about muscle
and muscle performance
6723.2 would not be adequate if
we didn't mention something
6725.33 about nutrition,
6726.4 but rather than have a whole
discussion about nutrition,
6728.5 'cause there's lots of
information about that online,
6731.37 for instance, if you want to gain muscle
6732.79 that you need to have a calorie
surplus of about 10 to 15%.
6737.84 You could have a calorie surplus of more.
6739.6 If you want to avoid gaining weight
6742.16 then you would not create a
calorie surplus, et cetera.
6744.73 You can find all that information online.
6746.3 That's not what this
podcast is really about.
6748.78 We had a month where we talked a lot
6751.4 about hormones and food and moods.
6753.41 We talked about foods, but more
6755.3 as they relate to the nervous system.
6756.81 When it comes to supporting muscle.
6760.05 So supporting the synthesis of larger
6763.38 what I called myosin
balloons, it does seem
6766.4 that ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams
6770.12 of the essential amino acid leucine
6772.36 with each meal is important.
6773.65 Now, that does not necessarily
mean from supplements.
6776.89 In fact, most people recommend
that you get your protein,
6781.62 you get your amino acids,
6783.1 including your essential amino acids
6784.86 and your leucine from whole foods.
6786.67 High quality proteins aren't
high density proteins.
6790.26 What do you mean by that?
6791.093 Well, it is true that a lot of
sources of protein are found
6795.01 in things like beans and
nuts and things like that
6797.68 that all the essential amino
acids can be found there
6800.82 but per unit calorie, if
it's in your practice,
6805.47 if it's in your ethics to
ingest animal proteins,
6808.14 it's true that for instance, 200 calories
6811.7 of steak or chicken or fish or eggs
6814.45 will have a higher density
of essential amino acids
6817.15 than the equivalent amount of
calories from nuts or plants.
6820.88 That's just simply the way it works.
6822.54 So for the vegans and vegetarians
6824.32 I'm certainly, I'm not
saying there's no way
6826.52 that you can support muscle growth.
6828.17 You absolutely can.
6829.43 Some of them might want
to supplement leucine
6831.73 but this 700 to 3000
milligrams of leucine per meal
6835.94 is one of the best ways that's been shown
6837.83 to support the synthesis of more myosin
6841.01 if your goal is hypertrophy
6842.544 and it's also the way that you
would support muscle repair
6845.73 if your goal is strength.
6847.36 So that's specifically geared
6848.51 towards muscle hypertrophy and strength.
6851.0 And I encourage you to think
6852.38 about this protein density issue.
6855.44 And whether or not you ingest
animal proteins or you don't,
6860.57 to think about whether or
not you're getting sufficient
6863.61 essential amino acids, especially leucine.
6867.03 Now, many people have
addressed the question
6870.44 of whether or not you need to
eat six or seven times a day.
6873.41 It turns out that you don't
6874.3 that's kind of the old school thinking
6875.95 that you need to eat very frequently.
6877.37 I think for certain
athletes were very active
6880.61 for drug assisted meaning people
6882.79 that are enhancing their
testosterone levels
6884.41 to super physiological levels,
6885.82 where they are experiencing
very heightened levels
6888.09 of protein synthesis and
they can utilize all that.
6890.38 That might make sense.
6891.26 Again, I'm not supporting the use
6892.67 of those performance enhancing drugs
6894.24 but there are people doing that.
6895.53 And that's one of the reasons
why they eat so frequently.
6899.03 And so much protein for typical people
6901.47 who are not doing that, I
imagine most of you are not.
6904.34 Then it does appear that you need to eat
6907.657 but you don't need to eat
six or seven times a day.
6910.42 It does seem like not eating
once a day is also important.
6913.24 So somewhere between one meal
a day and six meals a day,
6916.35 lies the more reasonable two or three
6918.3 or maybe four times a day.
6920.56 I think that a whole discussion
about this is warranted
6923.84 and we'll have this
discussion with Dr. Galpin
6926.0 at a future time of whether or not
6928.99 eating protein more frequently
6930.28 can enhance this myosin synthesis.
6933.05 But I think the simple takeaway
6934.77 from the literature that
I was able to extract
6936.212 and from my discussion with him is,
6938.54 eating two to four times a day,
6940.0 making sure you're getting
sufficient amino acids
6942.581 in a way that's compatible
with your ethics
6945.14 and with your nutritional regimen
6946.7 is going to support muscle
repair, muscle growth
6950.49 strength improvements,
et cetera, just fine.
6953.55 There's one more thing
that I'd like to cover
6955.67 which is the relationship
6956.81 between particular kinds of exercise
6958.9 and our ability to think and
perform cognitive functions.
6963.7 We all hear that exercise
is so vital for our brain
6966.72 that it supports our brain
health and our body health.
6968.67 And indeed that's true
provided it's done correctly.
6972.44 However, many of us are
familiar with the experience
6976.06 of going for a run or going for a swim
6978.26 or working out hard in
the gym, and then not
6980.158 being able to use our brain
to be essentially useless
6983.18 for cognitive functions
for the rest of the day.
6986.26 I discussed this with
Dr. Galpin this morning,
6989.44 and I learned something very interesting,
6990.81 which is that hard bouts of exercise
6993.75 of the sort where you're
training near failure
6995.78 or you're generating focused
muscular contractions,
6999.57 for obsession that lasts anywhere
7002.12 from, I don't know, 30, 45
minutes, maybe 60 minutes
7005.0 or a long run where you're engaging
7006.9 in some interval training during that run,
7009.57 after exercise, there's a
reduction in oxygenation
7013.57 of the brain.
7014.403 So there's actually a quite
significant dip in the amount
7016.76 of oxygen that your neurons are getting
7018.096 and therefore your ability to think.
7020.46 So it's important that
you control the intensity
7022.795 and the duration of your
training sessions so
7024.894 that you're still able to do well in life
7027.65 and lean to life the way you need to,
7029.91 because I'm guessing most of you are not
7032.19 in a position to just prioritize
your physical training
7034.38 you also need to use your minds.
7036.78 I'm certainly familiar with
wanting to get exercise
7039.1 but also the requirement of needing
7040.48 to perform cognitive
work throughout the day.
7044.64 It also turns out that you can leverage
7046.81 something interesting
about exercise and nerve
7049.22 to muscle work in ways that can benefit
7051.99 cognitive function and focus.
7053.95 And it has to do with
the way that your body
7056.33 and your nervous system predict bouts
7058.58 of intense focused effort.
7060.36 So let's say you're doing
resistance training two
7062.66 or three times a week,
maybe even four times a week
7064.8 and you're doing it
consistently at a given time.
7068.77 There are clocks,
literally biological clocks
7071.83 within the liver and within the brain
7074.04 that learn to predict that
focus and that intense work.
7079.13 If you are trying to get
intense cognitive work done,
7083.81 you might try scheduling
that cognitive work
7086.47 on the days when you
don't do physical training
7089.34 at the same time when
you normally would do
7091.63 that intense, focused physical training.
7094.74 Because the systems of the body
7096.56 that generate acetylcholine release
7098.17 and other neuromodulators, the systems,
7100.13 of the body and brain that
generate focused effort,
7103.58 those are on this sort of clock mechanism
7106.23 in a way that you likely will find
7108.8 that after just a week of
training at regular times
7111.16 you will be able to focus
readily on other things
7114.78 when you're not training
provided you do it
7116.84 during the period of time of day
7118.679 when you normally would train.
7120.91 So is kind of an indirect positive effect.
7123.44 You're harnessing the focus
and the expectation of focus
7126.4 in your nervous system for
that particular time of day.
7128.95 And of course, we'd be remiss
7130.74 if we didn't talk about
time of day for training.
7133.21 It turns out that whether or
not you train in the morning
7136.81 or in the afternoon, it
doesn't really seem to matter
7139.46 for sake of things like hypertrophy
and strength, et cetera.
7142.79 Everyone seems to have a time of day
7144.21 that they prefer to train.
7146.02 I've said before and their reasons
7147.82 based on body temperature rhythms
7150.46 and cortisol release
that training 30 minutes,
7154.79 three hours or 11 hours
after your normal waking time
7157.94 can be very beneficial and can provide
7160.04 a sort of predictability or regularity
7161.89 to when your body will be ready to train
7165.3 and best apt to train well.
7167.84 There is some evidence that training
7169.04 in the afternoon is
better for performance,
7171.45 whereas training for
body composition changes
7173.363 and strain changes, et cetera
7175.64 doesn't really matter when you train.
7177.16 So you also want to make
it compatible with sleep,
7178.91 compatible with work that really gets
7180.58 down into the wits of optimization.
7182.6 But I think it's interesting to note
7184.13 that if you're going to
train at a regular time,
7187.18 you can take the days when you don't train
7190.26 and use that to enhance
your cognitive focus
7192.93 for things that have
nothing to do with exercise.
7195.39 So this might be writing, or reading,
7196.62 or music, or math, et cetera.
7198.75 Typically, I restrict
these podcast episodes
7200.997 to about 90 minutes.
7202.73 So called ultradian cycle for learning.
7204.66 Today was a bit longer.
7205.983 And I admit that I tried
to pack a lot into this.
7209.58 It is the last episode in this month
7211.75 on physical performance.
7212.9 I figured in this case more is better
7215.38 especially since everything
is time-stamped for you.
7218.2 You certainly don't have
to watch it all at once
7220.45 and you can come back to
it over and over again
7222.46 into the precise locations
in the episode that you like
7225.17 in order to take notes or
extract the information
7227.87 that you need.
7229.25 I'd like to point you
to Dr. Andy Galpin page.
7232.8 I highly recommend looking into the work
7235.54 that he's doing if you want more details.
7237.7 He's very, very skilled,
excellent communicator.
7240.31 He superb at what he does.
7241.49 He's a professor.
7242.323 He works with athletes.
7243.33 He works with typical
folks in the exercise
7245.72 and muscle physiology world.
7247.36 Brad Schoenfelds work.
7248.42 I also have a lot of respect for.
7249.63 I've never met him.
7250.463 I don't know him.
7251.296 There's no paid endorsement here.
7252.55 They're not sponsors are related
to the podcast in any way.
7255.29 I just think the work
is of very high quality
7257.81 and they're both on the academic side
7259.28 and the practical side.
7260.197 And of course there are
other people out there
7262.78 doing fabulous work in this area as well.
7266.23 If you like this podcast
and you're benefiting
7268.13 from the information that you're learning
7269.7 and you want to support us, the simplest
7271.8 and most straightforward way
to do that is a zero cost way
7274.32 which is subscribe to
the podcast on YouTube.
7278.91 Click the Subscribe button
7280.73 and to subscribe on Apple
and Spotify as well.
7283.87 That really helps us.
7284.82 It helps us get the
message about the podcasts
7286.46 out more broadly generally,
7288.36 and it ensures that you
don't miss any episodes.
7290.95 We release episodes every
Monday, but starting soon,
7294.09 and from time to time,
7295.35 we release shorter episodes in between.
7297.79 So you'll be sure to hear those episodes.
7300.33 In addition, check out the
sponsors that we mentioned
7302.4 at the beginning of the podcast.
7304.37 If you like and if you're
able to, supporting us
7306.53 through those sponsors is a terrific way
7308.24 to support our production staff
and the podcast generally.
7311.44 A zero cost way to support the podcast
7313.19 is to tell your friends, tell
your neighbors, tell anyone
7315.9 that you think might benefit
from the information.
7317.84 The way this podcast is set
up, the information is batched
7321.63 into four or five episodes, all centered
7324.49 around a given theme or topic
like hormones, like sleep.
7327.89 So the episodes on sleep, for instance
7329.51 that were way back in January,
7331.05 and what seems like way back
7333.45 are still every bit as relevant today
7335.68 as they were back in January for somebody
7338.17 that has challenges with sleep
7339.59 and wants to understand
sleep and get better at sleep
7341.72 or wants to understand their
dreams or how to use sleep
7344.61 and dreaming to leverage
neuroplasticity and learning.
