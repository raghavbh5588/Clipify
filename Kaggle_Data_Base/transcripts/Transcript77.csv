0.031,"- Welcome to the Huberman lab podcast, "
2.3,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.92,for everyday life. 
6.441,[upbeat music] 
9.46,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.51,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.19,at Stanford school of medicine. 
15.35,"Today, we are going to talk all about attention deficit, "
18.46,"hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. "
21.71,We are also going to talk about normal levels of focus. 
25.34,"What are normal levels of focus and how all of us, "
28.93,whether or not we have ADHD or not can improve our ability 
33.28,to focus our ability to rule out distraction. 
36.61,"It turns out those are two separate things, "
39.03,as well as remember information better. 
42.22,We are also going to talk about 
43.74,"how we can learn to relax while focusing, "
46.77,which turns out to be a critical component of learning new 
50.05,information and for coming up with new creative ideas. 
54.89,"So whether or not you have ADHD or know someone who does, "
59.13,"or if you're somebody who feels that they do not have ADHD, "
62.66,but would simply like to improve their ability to focus 
65.98,or to be more creative. 
67.75,This episode is definitely for you as well. 
71.15,We are going to talk about drug based tools 
73.96,that are out there. 
74.87,We are going to talk about behavioral tools. 
77.04,"We will talk about the role of diet and supplementation, "
80.25,and we will talk about new emerging 
82.44,"brain machine interface devices, "
84.81,things like transcranial magnetic stimulation. 
87.57,"If you don't know what that is, don't worry, "
89.12,I will explain it to you. 
90.63,These are non-invasive methods for rewiring your brain 
94.71,in order to make focusing more natural for you 
98.57,and to teach you how to increase your depth of focus. 
101.91,"Now, just a quick reminder "
103.38,"that any time we discuss a psychiatric disorder, "
107.11,it's important that we remember 
109.12,that all of us have the temptation to self-diagnose 
112.06,or to diagnose others. 
114.01,"So, as I list off some of the symptomology of ADHD, "
116.59,some of that symptomology might resonate with you. 
118.67,"You might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD "
120.87,"or you might decide that someone you know, "
122.84,definitely has ADHD. 
125.23,"However, it is very important that you don't self-diagnose "
128.24,or diagnose somebody else 
130.33,the clear and real diagnosis of ADHD 
134.47,"really should be carried out by a psychiatrist, a physician, "
138.67,or a very well-trained clinical psychologist. 
141.59,There are clear criteria for what constitutes 
145.12,full-blown ADHD. 
147.12,"However, many of us have constellations of symptoms "
151.08,that make us somewhat like somebody with ADHD 
155.03,"and if you're struggling with focus nowadays, "
156.87,"as a lot of people are because of stress, "
160.02,"because of smartphone use, "
162.13,which turns out can induce adult ADHD. 
164.91,We'll talk about that. 
166.519,We'll then pay attention to the symptomology. 
168.95,You may actually require professional treatment 
171.21,"you might not, "
172.37,equally important is to remember 
173.59,"that some of the terms that we cover, "
174.99,like impulse control and attention and concentration 
178.81,are somewhat subjective and they can change over time. 
181.51,Sometimes we have a better level of attention than others. 
185.0,Maybe it depends on how we slept 
186.32,or other events going on in our life 
188.04,where something that we're entirely unaware of. 
190.238,The important thing to remember 
191.97,is that we can all improve our attentional capacity. 
195.04,We can all rewire the circuits that make heightened levels 
198.57,"of focus, more accessible to us. "
201.18,"We can do that through multiple types of interventions, "
204.06,and we are going to cover all those interventions today. 
207.69,"Before we march into the material, "
209.11,I'd like to remind that this podcast is separate 
211.15,from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
213.37,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
215.5,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
218.36,and science related tools to the general public. 
221.28,"And keeping with that theme, "
222.42,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
225.3,Our first sponsor is Roka. 
227.234,Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses 
229.48,that are of the utmost quality. 
231.633,I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system 
234.28,and I can tell you that there are many features 
235.86,built into our visual system 
237.49,"that allows us to see things clearly, "
239.42,whether or not we are in shade 
240.81,"or bright sunlight, et cetera. "
242.83,A lot of sunglasses have the problem 
244.65,that you have to constantly take them off 
246.76,"and put them back on again, "
247.76,"because of changes in background luminance, as we call it, "
250.75,"Roka, sunglasses have solved this problem. "
252.71,It doesn't matter if you're standing in tree shade 
255.14,"or a bright light, or what have you, "
257.44,you can always see things with perfect clarity 
259.75,and that shows that they really understand 
261.63,the way that the visual system works 
263.58,and their eyeglasses are built accordingly. 
266.69,"I wear readers at night, "
268.36,"so I wear eye glasses to read at night, "
270.99,or when I drive at night and their readers 
273.42,and eyeglasses are terrific as well. 
275.6,One thing I like so much about their eyeglasses 
277.67,"and their sunglasses is that despite being, "
280.197,"""Performance glasses"" mean you can wear them on running "
282.41,"or swimming or biking, they don't fall off your face, "
284.36,"even if you get sweaty, they're very lightweight. "
286.28,You don't even notice that they're on 
287.95,is that the aesthetic is really good. 
290.59,"A lot of performance glasses, "
291.88,"they look kind of ridiculous, frankly, "
293.64,"they make people look like cyborgs, "
295.53,"but their aesthetics are terrific, "
296.76,"they have a lot of different styles, "
297.91,you can select from. 
299.12,The company was founded by two All-American swimmers 
301.15,from Stanford and everything about their sunglasses 
303.37,and eyeglasses were designed with optical clarity 
305.87,and performance in mind. 
307.32,"If you'd like to try Roca, you can go to roka.com, "

315.5,Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo. 
318.13,Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California 
321.35,that raises organic grass fed 
323.01,and finished certified humane meat. 
326.03,I tend to eat meat about once a day. 
328.03,So typically I'll fast until about noon or one 
330.73,and then my lunch consists of a small piece of steak 
333.1,or chicken and some salad 
334.98,and then I tend to eat my carbohydrates in the evening 
337.4,before I go to sleep. 
338.69,Sometimes and especially lately I'm eating my protein 
341.23,earlier in the day 
342.5,because I'm playing around with some of the findings 
344.96,related to protein intake early in the day. 
346.85,"But regardless, I'm eating meat about once a day. "
349.36,"For me, it's extremely important "
351.0,that any meat that I consume 
353.08,come from humanely raised animals 
355.07,and that the meat be of the very highest quality. 
357.75,So with Belcampo meets the animals graze on open pastures 
360.78,"and seasonal grasses, which results in meats, "
362.99,"that's much higher in nutrients and healthy fats, "
365.08,including omega-
"3s,",
366.16,"which I've talked a lot about on this podcast, "
368.47,the importance of omega-
3s,"for heart health, "
371.06,"for brain health, for mood, et cetera. "
374.37,"Personally, I love their rib eye steaks, "
376.23,"their New York steaks, their chicken is terrific "
379.26,and I also liked the organic meatballs. 
381.07,"All the elk meat is organic and grass fed, "
383.27,"and grass-finished, if you'd like to try Belcampo, "
386.04,first time customers can get 
20%,off 
388.04,by going to belcampo.com/Huberman 
390.84,and using the code Huberman at checkout. 
393.27,Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix sleep. 
395.96,Helix sleep makes mattresses and pillows 
398.53,that are absolutely second to none. 
400.53,"I started sleeping on a Helix mattress about eight, "
402.67,"nine months ago, and I've never slept better in my life. "
406.54,"If you go to the Helix site, "
407.73,"they have a short two minute quiz, "
409.82,"and that quiz asks you questions like, "
411.7,do you sleep on your back? 
412.76,Do you sleep on your side? 
413.61,Do you sleep on your stomach? 
414.48,Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night? 
416.47,Maybe you don't know 
417.32,"and they actually have an option to select, I don't know "
420.48,and Helix will match you to a mattress 
423.04,that specific to your sleep needs. 
424.85,It turns out to be really important. 
426.23,Some people have the tendency to run hot 
428.88,and sleep on their stomach. 
429.713,Other people lie on their back 
431.03,and they're waking up cold in the middle of the night. 
433.49,So you really need a mattress 
434.52,that's matched to your sleep needs. 
436.5,"I did that and I matched to the dusk mattress, D-U-S-K "
440.37,and it turns out to be perfect for me and my sleep needs 
444.27,as well their pillows are really terrific. 
446.0,"So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, "
447.83,"go to helixsleep.com/huberman, "
450.9,"take their two minutes sleep quiz, "
452.12,and they'll match you to a customized mattress 
454.15,and you'll get up to $
200,off any of their mattresses 
457.26,and you'll get two free pillows with your order. 
459.71,They have a 
10,year warranty. 
461.14,You have to try it out for 
100,nights risk-free 
463.42,it's more than three months 
464.5,"and if you don't like it, "
465.35,they'll pick it up for you and they'll take it away 
467.7,and you get all your money back. 
469.31,"So if you're interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman "
472.67,for up to $
200,off your mattress and two free pillows. 
476.37,"So let's talk about ADHD, "
478.26,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. 
480.96,Let's also talk about focus and attention 
483.28,and everybody's ability to focus and attend 
486.12,not just people with ADHD. 
488.57,We are also going to talk about tools 
490.15,"that would allow anyone, "
491.82,whether or not they have ADHD or not 
493.95,to enhance their level of concentration and focus. 
498.03,"Now, ADHD used to be called ADD Attention Deficit Disorder. "
504.119,We have record of ADD in the medical literature 
507.91,dating back to as early as 
1904.,
510.64,Now there's nothing special about 
1904.,
512.67,That's just the first time that it showed up 
514.11,in the standard medical literature. 
516.76,"We have to believe that ADD, "
519.24,which we now call ADHD existed before 
1904,
523.35,and probably long before 
"1904,",why? 
527.17,"Well, because it has a strong genetic component. "
530.26,"If you have a close relative that has ADHD, "
533.84,there's a much higher probability that you will have ADHD 
537.28,and that probability goes up depending on how closely 
540.01,related to that person you happen to be. 
542.09,"So for instance, "
542.923,"if you're an identical twin and your twin has ADHD, "
546.81,"there's a very high concordance as we say, "
549.88,a very high probability that you will have ADHD 
552.89,up to 
75%,chance. 
555.25,"If you have a fraternal twin with ADHD, "
557.15,that number goes down a bit in the 
50,to 
60%,range 
560.62,and so on. 
561.55,"If you have a parent with ADHD, "
563.6,that number ranges anywhere from 
10,to 
25%,"likelihood, "
566.86,that you will have ADHD if you have two parents 
568.74,"and so on and so on, okay? "
570.26,So there's a genetic component 
571.75,"that genetic component it turns out, "
573.44,relates directly to how specific neural circuits 
576.33,"in the brain wire up, "
577.99,"the chemicals they use and the way they use those chemicals, "
581.24,a topic that we are going to discuss in depth today. 
585.27,"Now, if you have a close relative with ADHD, "
588.15,that does not mean that you are faded to have ADHD 
591.5,"and if you happen to have ADHD, "
593.86,there are ways to overcome those symptoms 
596.67,"of lack of attention, impulsivity and so on. "
600.14,Another important point about ADHD 
603.47,"is that it has nothing to do with intelligence, "
606.47,whether or not we're talking about intelligence 
608.14,measured by a standard IQ test 
610.164,"a rather controversial issue as many of you probably know, "
613.04,there are lots of forms of intelligence 
615.39,that a standard IQ test just wouldn't pick up 
618.43,"emotional intelligence, musical intelligence, "
620.23,"spatial intelligence, all sorts of intelligences. "
624.62,None of them are related to ADHD. 
627.89,Being very high functioning doesn't make you 
629.98,more likely to have ADHD and being ADHD 
633.61,doesn't necessarily mean that you have a low IQ. 
635.33,So there are people with ADHD who have low IQs 
637.88,"people with ADHD with high IQ, "
639.92,people with ADHD with high emotional IQ or with low IQ 
643.58,"in the emotional scale, it's all over the place. "
646.63,The important point is that your ability to attend and focus 
650.04,"does not relate to how smart you are or your IQ of any type, "
655.41,not just a standard IQ. 
657.06,The renaming of the ADD to ADHD took place 
660.86,in the mid to late 
1980s,
663.34,when the psychiatric community 
665.07,and the psychological community 
666.92,started taking better notice of the fact that 
670.91,so-called hyperactive kids also had attentional issues. 
674.85,"This might seem obvious, "
676.16,but there's been extensive and ongoing revision 
679.85,of the criteria for designating a psychiatric disorder 
683.61,and this is still an ongoing process even today. 
687.14,"So in the mid eighties, "
688.38,we started hearing about ADHD 
690.09,and then gradually that term ADD has been dropped away. 
693.15,"However, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD "
698.55,has led to much better diagnosis and detection of ADHD. 
704.79,So right now the current estimates are that 
706.9,about one in 
10,children and probably more have ADHD. 
713.04,The current estimates are anywhere from 
"10%,",one in 
10,
716.81,to as high as 
12%.,
718.8,"Now, fortunately about half of those "
720.91,"will resolve with proper treatment, "
723.74,but the other half typically don't. 
725.96,The other thing that we are seeing a lot nowadays 
728.7,is increased levels of ADHD in adults 
733.34,and there's some question as to whether or not 
735.45,those adults had ADHD that went undetected 
738.41,during their childhood or whether or not 
741.03,ADHD is now cropping up in adulthood 
744.07,due to the way that we are interacting with the world 
746.94,"in particular smart phone use, "
750.562,"the combination of email, text, real-world interactions, "
755.89,multiple apps and streams of media and social media 
759.64,all coming in at once trying to manage life. 
762.1,All of the things that are going on 
764.58,are creating a kind of cloud of poles on our attention 
769.13,and so there is this question to whether or not 
771.42,we are creating ADHD in adults that never had ADHD 
776.1,prior to being an adult. 
779.1,So let's talk about attention 
780.68,and first let's just define what we mean by attention 
783.891,out there in the scientific literature 
785.667,"and in discussions about ADHD, "
788.18,we will hear things like attention and focus 
790.81,and concentration and impulse control 
793.57,"for sake of today's discussion, "
795.361,"attention, focus, and concentration "
797.82,"are essentially the same thing, okay? "
800.1,We could split hairs and the scientific literature 
802.21,does split hairs about these. 
803.96,But if we want to understand the biology 
805.73,and we want to have 
806.75,"a straightforward conversation about ADHD, "
809.52,"if I say attention or focus, "
811.47,"I'm basically referring to the same thing, "
813.67,"unless I specify otherwise, okay? "
816.12,So people with ADHD have trouble holding their attention. 
821.197,What is attention? 
823.71,"Well, attention is perception. "
826.61,It's how we are perceiving the sensory world. 
830.55,So just a little bit of neurobiology 
"101,",
832.65,we are sensing things all the time. 
834.69,There's information coming into our nervous system 
836.41,all the time. 
837.243,"For instance, right now you're hearing sound waves. "
839.72,"You are seeing things, "
840.74,"you are sensing things against your skin, "
842.76,but you're only paying attention to some of those 
845.765,and the ones that you're paying attention to 
848.69,are your perceptions. 
849.83,"So if you hear my voice, you are perceiving my voice. "
852.88,You are not paying attention to your other senses 
855.85,"at the moment, okay? "
857.07,You might even be outside in a breeze 
858.86,"and until I said that, "
859.89,"you might not be perceiving that breeze, "
861.97,but your body was sensing it all along. 
865.37,"So attention and focus are more or less the same thing, "
868.36,but impulse control is something separate because impulse 
871.31,control requires pushing out or putting the blinders on 
875.9,to sensory events in our environment. 
878.38,"It means lack of perception, "
880.16,impulse control is about limiting our perception. 
884.22,People with ADHD have poor attention 
887.63,and they have high levels of impulsivity 
890.478,they're easily distractable. 
892.55,But the way that shows up is very surprising. 
895.74,You might think that people with ADHD 
898.31,just simply can't attend anything. 
900.33,"They really can't focus, "
901.79,"even if they really want to, but that's simply not the case. "
905.48,"People with ADHD yes, they are distractable. "
909.65,"Yes, they are impulsive. "
912.05,"Yes, they are easily annoyed "
913.89,by things happening in the room. 
915.49,They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well. 
918.29,"Not always, but often "
920.01,however people with ADHD can have a hyper focus 
924.32,and incredible ability to focus 
927.09,on things that they really enjoy 
929.48,or and are intrigued by. 
931.82,"Now, this is a very important point "
933.6,because typically we think of somebody with ADHD 
937.36,"as being really wild and hyperactive, "
940.1,or having no ability whatsoever to sit still and attend 
943.986,and while that phenotype as we call it 
946.8,"that contour of behavior and cognition can exist, "
952.5,"many people, if not all people with ADHD, "
955.37,"if you give them something they really love, "
957.71,like if the child loves video games 
959.53,"or if a child loves to draw, "
961.34,or if an adult loves a particular type of movie 
965.48,"or a person very much, they will obtain laser-focus "
970.0,without any effort. 
971.68,So that tells us that people with ADHD 
974.09,"have the capacity to attend, "
976.28,but they can't engage that attention 
979.21,"for things that they don't really, really want to do "
982.58,"and as we all know much of life, "
984.73,whether or not you're a child or an adult 
986.61,"involves doing a lot of things that we don't want to do, "
988.73,much of our schooling involves doing things 
990.035,that we would prefer not to do 
992.44,"and sort of forcing ourselves to do it, to attend, "
995.55,even though we are not super interested 
997.42,in what we are attending to. 
999.31,There are a couple other things 
1000.143,that people with ADHD display quite often. 
1003.76,One is challenges with time perception. 
1007.62,Now time perception is a fascinating aspect 
1010.1,of how our brain works 
1011.08,and later we're going to talk about time perception 
1013.05,and how you can actually get better at time perception. 
1016.25,It's very likely that right now you are doing things 
1018.96,that get in the way of optimal time perception 
1022.0,and I will tell you how to adjust your ability 
1025.03,to measure time with your brain. 
1029.0,People with ADHD often run late. 
1032.09,"They often procrastinate, "
1034.01,but what's interesting and surprising 
1035.7,"is that if they are given a deadline, "
1037.95,they actually can perceive time very well 
1040.94,and they often can focus very well 
1043.44,if the consequences of not completing a task 
1046.22,or not attending are severe enough. 
1048.52,It's a little bit like the way that people with ADHD 
1051.584,can really focus if they like something. 
1054.31,"Well, if they're scared enough about the consequences "
1056.82,"of not attending, oftentimes not always, "
1059.49,but oftentimes they can attend. 
1062.68,If they're not really concerned about a deadline 
1064.95,"or a consequence, "
1066.361,"well, then they tend to lose track of time "
1068.77,and they tend to underestimate how long things will take. 
1072.25,"Now many people do that, not just people with ADHD, "
1075.18,"but people with ADHD have challenges, "
1078.84,understanding how to line up the activities of their day 
1082.56,in order to meet particular deadlines 
1084.68,"even if it's just a simple thing, "
1086.15,"like finishing one set of tasks before lunch, "
1090.29,"oftentimes they will remember that lunch starts at noon, "
1093.83,but somehow they aren't able to fill the intervening time 
1096.98,in a way that's productive 
1099.17,and they can obsess about 
1100.51,"the upcoming deadline for instance, "
1102.77,we will talk about how to remedy this. 
1105.08,"In addition, "
1105.99,"their spatial organization skills are often subpar, "
1110.36,"not always, but often you will find that somebody with ADHD "
1114.85,uses what's called the pile system 
1117.17,"in order to organize things, "
1119.26,they will take many belongings 
1121.25,and this could be in the kitchen or in their bedroom 
1123.44,or in their office or in any space 
1126.6,and they will start piling things up 
1128.19,according to a categorization system 
1130.06,that makes sense to them and only them. 
1132.41,It doesn't really have any logical framework. 
1135.66,"Now, many people use the pile system "
1137.34,"and if you use the pile system, "
1138.42,that doesn't mean that you have ADHD 
1139.94,"in fact, if you're unpacking a house "
1141.58,"or you've moved recently, "
1143.23,"or you've received a lot of presence recently, "
1145.75,the pile system makes perfect sense to organize your space. 
1149.48,But people with ADHD tend to organize things 
1152.23,according to the pile system all the time 
1154.7,and that pile system doesn't work for them. 
1157.7,"Okay, so that's the key distinction "
1158.98,"that they use a filing system, and it's not really files, "
1161.44,"they're piling things up in a way that makes sense to them, "
1164.25,but then it doesn't work for them in terms of what tasks 
1167.27,they actually need to perform. 
1169.08,They can't find things 
1170.56,or if anyone moves one thing then it's very disruptive 
1173.73,to their overall plan because their overall plan 
1175.73,doesn't really work in the first place. 
1178.14,So that's a common phenotype as we call it. 
1181.89,"A phenotype by the way, "
1182.73,is just an expression of a particular set of underlying 
1187.67,"genetic or psychological components, okay? "
1191.42,So we say the phenotype. 
1192.56,"So a phenotype can brown hair and green eyes, "
1195.46,"like for me, "
1196.32,a phenotype could also be 
1197.46,"that somebody uses the piling system, okay? "
1200.9,The other thing that people with ADHD have real trouble with 
1204.78,is so-called working memory. 
1206.95,Now you might think that people with ADHD 
1208.48,"would have really poor memories, "
1209.9,"but in fact, that's not the case. "
1211.42,People with ADHD often can have a terrific memory 
1214.89,"for past events, "
1216.18,they can remember upcoming events quite well. 
1219.16,Their memory is clearly working. 
1221.17,"However, one aspect of memory in particular "
1223.27,that we call working memory is often disrupted. 
1226.77,Working memory is the ability to keep 
1228.92,"specific information online, "
1230.95,"to recycle it in your brain over and over again, "
1233.22,so that you can use it in the immediate or short term. 
1236.62,"A good example of this would be you meet somebody, "
1239.07,"they tell you their name, "
1240.44,"they give you their phone number verbally, "
1242.24,and you have to walk back to your phone 
1243.91,and enter it into your phone. 
1246.07,"People without ADHD might have to put some effort into it, "
1249.44,"it might feel like a bit of a struggle, "
1250.77,but typically they will be able to recite that phone number 
1253.1,"in their mind over and over, and then put into their phone. "
1255.79,"People with ADHD, "
1256.94,tend to lose the ability or lack the ability 
1260.55,to remember things that they just need to keep online for 
1263.83,anywhere from 
10,"seconds to a minute or two, okay? "
1267.17,So a string of numbers like 
"6,",
"4,",
"3,",
"7,",
"8,",
1,for most people 
1271.01,would be pretty easy. 
1272.56,
"6,",
"4,",
"3,",
"7,",
"8,",
"1,",
"6,",
"4,",
"3,",
"7,",
"8,",
"1,",
1274.84,you could probably remember that a minute from now 
1277.17,without writing it down. 
1278.81,But if you add one more number to that 
"6,",
"4,",
"3,",
"7,",
"8,",
"1,",
"3,",
1283.25,"it gets tougher, okay? "
1285.07,So there's a reason why phone numbers typically have 
1288.37,"seven digits in them, of course, there's an area code, "
1291.03,but remembering information that strings out longer 
1295.53,than seven numbers or a sentence or two 
1299.49,"that's challenging for most people, "
1301.1,"people with ADHD have severe challenges, "
1303.21,even with much smaller batches of information 
1306.1,over even much smaller batches of time. 
1309.46,Deficits in working memory are also 
1311.13,something that we see in people who have 
1312.91,"frontotemporal dementia, "
1314.46,so damage to the frontal lobes 
1316.11,or age-related cognitive decline 
1319.41,and so it will come as no surprise that later 
1321.63,"when we discuss treatments, supplements, "
1324.89,"and other tools for ADHD, "
1327.19,"that many of those treatments, "
1328.53,supplements and tools for ADHD are similar to the ones 
1331.97,that work for age-related cognitive decline. 
1335.92,"Okay, so we've more or less established "
1339.35,the kind of menu of items that people with ADHD tend to have 
1343.16,some have all of them. 
1344.21,Some have just a subset of them. 
1346.22,"Their severity can range from very intense to mild, "
1351.12,"but in general, "
1352.1,"it's challenges with attention and focus, "
1355.23,"challenges with impulse control, they get annoyed easily. "
1358.41,"They have kind of an impulsivity, "
1359.81,they can't stay on task. 
1361.678,"Time perception can be off, "
1364.59,they use the piling system 
1365.98,or a system that doesn't work well for them 
1368.77,in order to organize their things in physical space 
1372.19,and they have a hard time with anything that's mundane 
1374.63,that they're not really interested in. 
1376.9,"But again, I just want to highlight that people with ADHD "
1379.65,"are able to obtain heightened levels of focus, "
1382.42,even hyper-focus for things that are exciting to them 
1385.52,and that they really want to engage in. 
1387.69,"So now you have the contour of what ADHD is, "
1390.38,"and if you're somebody who doesn't have ADHD, "
1392.76,you should also be asking yourself which aspects of ADHD 
1396.919,are similar to things I've experienced before. 
1400.64,Because what we know about the healthy brain 
1404.12,is that there's also a range of abilities to focus. 
1407.136,Some people focus very well on any task. 
1409.927,"You give them a task, they can just laser in on that task. "
1413.76,"Other people that have to kind of fight an internal battle, "
1416.69,they have to convince themselves 
1417.9,that it's important or interesting. 
1419.21,They have to kind of incentivize themselves internally. 
1422.9,"Other people doesn't matter, "
1425.67,"they could be bored to tears with the information, "
1427.94,"but they can do it just because they are, "
1430.017,"""Very disciplined people."" "
1431.61,We tend to admire those people 
1433.04,"but as you'll see a little bit later, "
1434.69,it's not clear that that's the best way 
1436.04,to run your attentional system. 
1437.75,There might be something to this business 
1439.94,of having heightened levels of attention 
1442.05,for the things that you are 
1443.22,most interested or excited by. 
1447.13,So let's drill into this issue of why people with ADHD 
1450.75,actually can focus very intensely on things that they enjoy 
1454.6,and are curious about. 
1456.7,"Now, enjoyment and curiosity are psychological terms, "
1461.35,they're not even really psychological terms. 
1462.95,They're just the way that we describe our human experience 
1465.57,"of liking things, wanting to know more about them. "
1468.81,"But from a neuro-biological perspective, "
1471.54,they have a very clear identity and signature 
1474.8,and that's dopamine. 
1476.818,"Dopamine is released from neurons, "
1478.96,it's what we call a neuromodulator 
1481.18,and as a neuromodulator it changes the activity 
1484.54,"of the circuits in the brain, "
1485.85,such that certain circuits are more active than others 
1489.061,"and in particular, "
1490.91,dopamine creates a heightened state of focus. 
1494.85,It tends to contract our visual world 
1497.57,and it tends to make us pay attention to things 
1500.02,that are outside and beyond the confines of our skin. 
1504.13,That's what we call exteroception. 
1506.43,Dopamine also tends to put us in a state of motivation 
1510.73,and wanting things outside the confines of our skin. 
1514.23,So whether or not we're pursuing something 
1516.0,"physical in our world, "
1517.56,or whether or not we're pursuing information 
1519.879,"in our outside world, "
1521.75,dopamine is largely responsible for our ability 
1524.84,and our drive to do that. 
1527.199,But dopamine as a neuromodulator is also involved 
1530.81,in changing the way that we perceive the world. 
1534.15,"So, as I mentioned earlier "
1535.21,you have all these senses coming in 
1537.2,and you can only perceive some of them 
1539.16,because you're only paying attention to some of them. 
1541.802,Dopamine when it's released in our brain 
1545.63,tends to turn on areas of our brain 
1547.91,that narrow our visual focus 
1550.09,"and our auditory focus, "
1551.81,"so it creates a cone of auditory attention, "
1554.36,"that's very narrow, "
1555.68,creates a tunnel of visual attention that's very narrow. 
1558.87,"Whereas when we have less dopamine, "
1560.71,"we tend to view the entire world, "
1562.83,"we tend to see the whole scene that we are in, "
1564.94,we tend to hear everything all at once. 
1567.47,"So as I describe this, "
1569.062,hopefully you're already starting to see and understand 
1572.94,"how having dopamine release can allow a person, "
1577.34,whether or not they have ADHD or not 
1580.05,to direct their attention to particular things 
1582.85,"in their environment, all right? "
1584.5,So now what we're doing is we're moving away from attention 
1587.76,"as this kind of vague ambiguous term, "
1590.41,"and we're giving it a neurochemical identity dopamine, "
1593.55,and we are giving it a neural circuit identity 
1596.56,and just to put a little bit of flavor and detail 
1599.82,"on which neurocircuits those are, "
1601.65,I want to discuss two general types of neurocircuits 
1604.59,that dopamine tends to enhance. 
1606.99,So let's talk neurocircuits 
1608.56,"and for those of you that love hearing neuroscience, "
1611.28,"nomenclature, you're going to eat this part up "
1614.18,and for those of you that don't like a lot of names 
1616.35,of brain areas I invite you to tune out 
1619.24,or just try and grab the top contour of this. 
1621.94,"I will describe it in pretty general terms, "
1623.83,but I will give some detail because I know there are 
1626.29,some of you out there who really want to dig deeper into 
1628.699,"what the exact structures and connectivities are, okay? "
1632.41,So there are two main types of circuits that 
1635.2,"we need to think about with respect to ADHD, "
1637.55,attention and dopamine. 
1639.06,The first one is called the default mode network. 
1642.13,The default mode network is the network of brain areas 
1645.75,in your brain and my brain and in everybody's brain 
1648.55,that is active when we're not doing anything 
1651.88,when we're just sitting there idle at rest. 
1654.29,"Now it's very hard to not think about anything, "
1656.56,"but when you're not engaged in any type of specific task, "
1659.78,"so you're not driving, you're not playing a video game, "
1662.18,"you're not trying to study, you're not trying to listen, "
1664.57,you're just sitting there letting your brain 
1666.21,kind of go wherever it wants to go. 
1668.74,Your default mode network underlies that state of mind. 
1674.25,The other set of circuits that we're going to think about 
1676.94,"and talk about with respect to ADHD are the task networks, "
1681.63,"the networks of the brain that make you goal oriented, "
1684.92,or that are at least trying to make you goal oriented 
1688.41,and those are a completely different set of brain areas. 
1691.33,"However, the default mode network "
1694.76,and these tasks networks are communicating with one another 
1698.52,and they're doing that in very interesting ways. 
1701.24,So first I want to describe how these two 
1703.82,"sets of brain areas, "
1705.01,the default mode network 
1706.11,"and the task networks normally interact, okay? "
1709.59,So little bit of naming here 
1711.01,again feel free to ignore it 
1712.3,"if you don't want this level of detail, "
1714.36,but the default mode network includes 
1718.04,"an area called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, "
1721.35,"frontal cortex, no surprises in the front "
1723.828,"and you have a dorsal, the top "
1725.36,"and side lateral part dorsolateral, prefrontal cortex. "
1729.07,"You got one on each side of your brain, right? "
1731.48,And then you have a brain area called 
1732.7,the posterior cingulate cortex 
1734.83,and then you have an area called the lateral parietal lobe. 
1737.2,"Again, you don't need to remember these names for, "
1738.99,these are three brain areas that normally 
1741.55,are synchronized in their activity. 
1743.21,"So when one of these areas is active in a typical person, "
1746.5,the other areas would be active as well. 
1748.64,So it's a little bit like a symphony or a band 
1750.85,"like a three-piece band is like drums, guitar, "
1753.2,"and bass they're playing together, okay? "
1756.16,That's how it is in a typical person 
1757.89,"and in a person with ADHD, "
1759.82,or even a person who has subclinical ADHD 
1762.55,"or in any human being who hasn't slept well, "
1766.03,what you find is the default mode network 
1767.99,is not synchronized. 
1769.0,These brain areas are just not playing well together. 
1772.87,Now the task networks include a different set of structures. 
1777.69,"It still involves the prefrontal cortex, "
1779.7,"but it's a different part of the prefrontal cortex, okay? "
1782.98,Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex 
1785.7,and there are some other brain areas 
1787.28,that the medial prefrontal cortex is communicating to 
1789.82,"all the time, mainly to suppress impulses. "
1793.26,It's shutting down the desire to stand up 
1796.34,"or to scratch the side of your cheek or your nose, "
1798.61,"if you're trying not to do that, "
1799.95,"anytime you're restricting your behavior, "
1801.9,"These task directed networks are very active, okay? "
1806.227,"Now normally in a person without ADHD, "
1810.26,the task networks and the default mode networks 
1814.05,"are going in kind of Seesaw fashion, "
1815.98,they are actually what we call anti-correlated. 
1818.81,"So it's not just that they are not correlated, "
1820.76,they're actually opposing one another 
1822.85,they are anti-correlated. 
1825.26,"In a person with ADHD, "
1826.88,the default mode networks and the tasks networks 
1829.51,are actually more coordinated. 
1831.86,"That might come a surprising, "
1833.1,I think that we all have this tendency 
1835.94,to kind of jump to conclusion and assume that somebody 
1839.0,"who doesn't have an easy time paying attention or has ADHD, "
1842.82,that their brain must be completely incoherent 
1845.55,that it's not working well 
1846.9,"and because everything's out of whack, "
1849.0,but there's something interesting about people with ADHD 
1851.62,whereby the task networks and the default mode networks 
1856.36,are actually working together in a way that's correlated 
1859.41,and that is what's abnormal. 
1861.77,So this would be like the guitar bass and the drums 
1865.12,playing together in a way where 
1867.61,"the bass isn't keeping the backbeat and the drums, "
1870.01,"aren't keeping the backbeat that they're playing together, "
1873.34,they're all playing the melodies and harmonies 
1874.99,in a way that just doesn't sound right. 
1877.13,That's what's going on in the brain of somebody with ADHD 
1881.53,and we can now confidently say 
1883.34,"based on brain imaging studies, "
1884.94,"that when somebody gets better, "
1886.87,"when they're treated for ADHD or when they age out of ADHD, "
1890.6,as sometimes it's the case that the default mode networks 
1894.75,and the task networks tend to become 
1896.58,"anti-correlated again, okay? "
1898.69,"So that's the underlying neurobiology, "
1901.45,but you'll notice that I didn't mention dopamine at all. 
1904.759,What dopamine is doing in this context 
1907.43,is dopamine is acting like a conductor. 
1910.58,Dopamine is saying this circuit should be active 
1912.87,then that circuit should be active. 
1914.03,It should be default mode network 
1915.52,"and then when the default mode network is not active, "
1917.92,then it should be the task network. 
1919.35,"So it's really acting as a conductor saying, you go, "
1921.55,"now you go, now you go, now you go. "
1923.32,"And in ADHD, "
1924.72,there's something about the dopamine system 
1926.755,that is not allowing it to conduct these networks 
1930.76,"and make sure that they stay what, "
1933.36,the engineers or physicists or mathematicians would say 
1935.58,"out of phase to be anti-correlated, okay? "
1938.74,"Out of phase and anti correlate, essentially the same thing, "
1941.02,at least for purposes of this discussion. 
1943.5,"So that raises two questions, "
1945.74,could it be that dopamine is not at sufficiently high levels 
1950.5,or could it be that dopamine is just doing it all wrong? 
1953.26,"In other words, "
1954.093,is there no conductor or is the conductor playing with like 
1956.56,little tiny toothpicks 
1957.58,and so the instruments can't see 
1959.62,what they're supposed to do. 
1961.02,They can't get the instruction 
1962.65,"'cause it's just not loud enough, so to speak, "
1965.09,"or could it be that the information is getting out, "
1967.1,"but the information that's getting out is wrong, "
1969.13,"the conductor's there, "
1970.01,but the conductor is in very good at conducting. 
1974.2,Now we can gain insight into how the system works 
1977.69,and fails and how to treat it 
1980.31,by looking at some of the current 
1981.86,"and previous treatments for ADHD, "
1984.3,as well as some of the recreational drugs 
1986.36,that people with ADHD tend to pursue and like 
1989.87,now I'm certainly not a proponent of people with ADHD 
1992.61,"taking drugs recreationally, "
1994.04,"that's not what this is about, "
1995.55,but if you look at their drug seeking behavior 
1998.3,and you couple that drug seeking behavior 
2001.53,"to their desire to remedy their attention deficit, "
2005.55,you start gaining some really interesting insight 
2008.28,into how dopamine is regulating these circuits 
2011.66,in normal circumstances and in people with ADHD. 
2015.94,"So what exactly is going on with the dopamine system, "
2018.45,in people with ADHD 
2020.26,and what's going on with the dopamine system 
2022.03,in people that have terrific levels of attention 
2024.98,for any task? 
2026.53,"Well, in the year "
"2015,",an important paper came out. 
2031.0,"The first author is Spencer, "
2032.82,"and it came out in a journal called Biological Psychiatry, "
2035.9,and it formalized the so-called 
2037.96,low dopamine hypothesis of ADHD. 
2041.91,The idea that dopamine was somehow involved 
2044.11,or not at the appropriate levels in people with ADHD 
2047.39,"had been around for a pretty long time, "
2049.85,but a formal proposition of the low dopamine hypothesis 
2054.83,led to some really important experiments and understanding 
2057.71,of what goes wrong in ADHD. 
2060.79,It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low 
2064.38,"in particular circuits in the brain, "
2067.15,that it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain 
2071.26,that are unrelated to the task that one is trying to do 
2075.37,and that is unrelated to the information 
2077.95,that one is trying to focus on. 
2079.93,So if you think back before you've got this 
2081.7,"default mode network and a task-related network, "
2084.26,and they need to be in this kind of concert of 
2086.96,anti-correlation and an ADHD they're firing together. 
2090.632,"Well, the problem seems to be that when dopamine is low, "
2095.32,"certain neurons are firing when they shouldn't be, "
2097.69,"this is like a band, right? "
2099.15,"We'll go back to our band, that's a guitar bass in it, "
2101.55,and the person playing the drums 
2103.35,and it's as if one of those or several of those instruments 
2106.66,"are playing notes when they shouldn't be playing, right? "
2109.5,The pauses and music are just as important 
2112.03,as the actual playing of notes. 
2115.68,"When dopamine is too low neurons fire, "
2119.05,more than they should in these networks 
2120.92,that govern attention. 
2123.09,This is the so-called low dopamine hypothesis 
2126.3,and if you start looking anecdotally 
2129.53,"at what people with ADHD have done for decades, "
2133.67,not just recently since the low dopamine hypothesis 
2136.67,"has been proposed, "
2138.32,but what they were doing in the 
1950s,and then the 
1940s,
2141.739,and the 
1960s.,
2142.572,"What you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs, "
2148.09,or they tend to indulge in non drug stimulants. 
2153.86,"So things like drinking, six cups of coffee "
2157.18,"or quadruple espressos, "
2159.25,or when it was more prominent 
2161.14,smoking a half a pack of cigarettes 
2163.02,and drinking four cups of coffee a day 
2165.106,or if the person had access to it 
2168.01,using cocaine as a recreational drug 
2170.1,or amphetamine as a recreational drug. 
2172.62,All of those substances that I just described 
2175.387,"in particular cocaine and amphetamine, "
2177.76,but also coffee and cigarettes 
2180.5,"increase levels of multiple neurotransmitters, "
2183.62,but all have the quality of increasing levels 
2186.25,"of dopamine in the brain and in particular, "
2189.11,in the regions of the brain that regulate attention 
2191.85,and these task related and default mode networks okay? 
2195.8,"Now young children, "
2196.91,fortunately don't have access to those kinds of stimulants 
2199.518,most of the time 
2201.17,and those stimulants all have high potential 
2204.57,for abuse in adults. 
2206.46,So we will talk about the potential for abuse 
2208.33,in a few minutes. 
2209.39,"But if you look at children, "
2211.61,"even very young children with ADHD, "
2214.55,"they show things like preference for sugary foods, "
2217.65,which also act as dopamine inducing stimulants. 
2221.81,"Now, of course, once they get access to soda pop "
2225.9,"and coffee and tea, "
2227.77,they start to indulge in those more than other people. 
2230.15,"For a long time, "
2230.983,it was thought that children with ADHD 
2232.45,consumed too many sugary foods or drank too much soda 
2235.68,or adults with ADHD 
2238.34,would take recreational drugs like methamphetamine 
2240.81,or cocaine or would drink coffee to excess 
2244.08,or smoke cigarettes to excess 
2245.88,because they had poor levels of attention 
2248.39,"and because they couldn't make good decisions, "
2251.21,they were too impulsive and so forth 
2253.38,"and while that certainly could be the case, "
2255.66,"knowing what we now know about dopamine, "
2257.95,and the fact that having enough dopamine is required 
2261.94,in order to coordinate these neural circuits 
2263.63,that allow for focus and quality decision-making 
2267.048,an equally valid idea is that these children 
2271.17,and these adults are actually trying to self-medicate 
2273.88,"by pursuing these compounds, right? "
2276.17,Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine. 
2279.11,"Well, what happens was when somebody with ADHD "
2281.83,"takes that drug, "
2283.29,it turns out they actually obtain 
2285.19,"heightened levels of focus, "
2287.12,their ability to focus on things 
2288.71,other than things they absolutely care 
2291.0,"intensely about goes up, "
2293.69,"likewise, children who consume anything "
2296.53,"that increases their levels of dopamine, "
2298.727,"if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer, "
2303.76,they tend to be able to focus more. 
2305.81,"Now, this is very different than children "
2308.48,who do not have ADHD. 
2309.91,"When they consume too much sugar, "
2310.94,they tend to become super hyperactive. 
2313.22,"When they consume any kind of stimulant, "
2314.93,they tend to go wild and run around like crazy. 
2317.463,"Actually, I have an anecdote about this "
2318.69,just to illustrate it. 
2320.38,"I have a friend, "
2321.35,he has two children that are now in their teens 
2324.01,"and twenties, but when they were little, "
2325.72,"one time, I brought them some chocolate just as a gift, "
2328.26,when I showed up at their house and within 
30,"minutes, "
2331.68,the kids were running around like crazy 
2333.73,"I mean they were pretty high energy kids, "
2336.13,but they were going bonkers 
2337.77,"and that's actually when the mother, my friend at the time, "
2341.01,"unfortunately, still now looked at the chocolate, "
2343.03,realized that it was chocolate with espresso beans in it. 
2346.14,It was like dark chocolate with espresso beans 
2347.53,"so I was really at fault there, "
2349.17,you don't want to give kids dark chocolate 
2350.88,"with espresso beans, "
2351.713,but what you're really seeing that hyperactivity 
2353.837,"that is dopamine, okay? "
2355.79,"It's the sugar combined with the caffeine in this case, "
2358.72,"combined with a few other compounds that exist in chocolate, "
2361.37,that really increase our levels of alertness 
2363.47,"and our tendency to want to move around a lot, okay? "
2367.63,So dopamine and low levels of dopamine 
2371.24,"apparently are what's wrong in people with ADHD, "
2374.98,that dopamine hypothesis 
2376.7,"is what led to the idea that treating people, "
2379.81,children and adults included with dopaminergic compounds 
2384.49,would somehow increase their ability to focus 
2388.42,and if you look at the major drugs that were developed 
2391.41,and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies 
2394.01,"for the treatment of ADHD, "
2396.92,those drugs have names like Ritalin. 
2399.85,"Nowadays, it's typically things like Adderall, Modafinil "
2404.7,"and some of the other derivatives, "
2406.17,they all serve to increase levels of dopamine 
2409.24,in particular dopamine in the networks 
2411.34,"that control task directed behavior, "
2413.67,and that coordinate the default mode network 
2416.73,and these task-related networks. 
2418.84,So many of you have probably heard of Ritalin. 
2420.9,Ritalin is a prescription stimulant that is 
2424.81,prescribed for ADHD as well as for narcolepsy. 
2428.27,Narcolepsy is a condition 
2430.01,in which people tend to fall asleep 
2432.05,"during the day time, quite a lot, "
2433.57,"excessive daytime sleepiness, "
2435.04,"not due to lack of sleep at night, "
2437.25,"but also tend to fall asleep when they get excited, "
2439.86,if they're really emotionally excited or about to eat 
2442.9,or any other kind of activity that 
2444.83,would normally get somebody really aroused and alert 
2447.46,"people with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep, "
2449.39,or they tend to become what's called cataplectic. 
2451.93,They tend to just sort of go limp in the muscles. 
2454.5,So it's this invasion of sleep into the daytime. 
2457.17,It's dysregulated by emotion. 
2459.02,"You can imagine why a stimulant, "
2460.89,"something that would wake you up, make you very alert, "
2463.21,focused and motivated 
2464.23,would be a good treatment for narcolepsy. 
2467.43,Adderall also is used to treat ADHD and to treat narcolepsy 
2473.77,things like Modafinil 
2475.26,also used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy. 
2478.18,So you're sensing a theme here. 
2479.81,So what are the differences and similarities 
2482.02,between these drugs 
2483.255,and what can that tell us about ADHD? 
2485.07,"Well, Ritalin was one of the first-generation drugs "
2489.41,that was prescribed for ADHD in order to deal head on 
2494.19,with this dopamine hypothesis. 
2496.18,"This idea that in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. "
2500.34,"Nowadays, Adderall is the more typically prescribed drug "
2503.48,for ADHD that has to do 
2505.78,"with some of the so-called pharmacokinetics, "
2507.83,the rate at which those drugs enter the system 
2510.79,and how long they last in the system. 
2512.82,"So for instance, "
2513.653,Ritalin was a drug that was packaged 
2516.13,into various time-release formulas. 
2518.33,Whereas initially Adderall was only released in a form that 
2522.39,"had a very short life, "
2523.63,So meaning that it wasn't in the bloodstream very long 
2527.34,and didn't affect the brain for very long 
2528.98,and so the dosages could be controlled in a more typical way 
2533.04,without going into a lot of tangential detail. 
2535.93,"As you all know, at different times of day, "
2538.02,you tend to be more or less alert. 
2539.89,So a long sustained release drug 
2542.66,while that might sound like a really terrific thing. 
2544.95,If that drug is having an effect 
2546.58,of making you more alert 
2547.85,"and it's released across very many hours of your day, "
2551.19,there might be periods of your day 
2552.8,"when you feel too alert, "
2554.4,"periods of your day, "
2555.233,"when you feel just right and periods of your day, "
2557.01,when you wished that you were more alert. 
2559.27,"These are some of the pharmacokinetics, kinetics, "
2562.07,meaning movement of the different compounds 
2564.064,"within the bloodstream and brain that could, "
2566.75,"you could imagine in a very real way, "
2568.63,would impact whether or not someone would feel really good 
2570.79,on one of these drugs or whether or not 
2572.5,they would feel too anxious or too sleepy and so on. 
2576.28,"Let's take a step back for a second and just ask, "
2577.97,what are these drugs? 
2579.39,"We know they increase dopamine, "
2581.0,but what are they really? 
2583.22,"Well, Ritalin also called methylphenidate "
2587.68,"is very similar to amphetamine speed, "
2591.33,or what's typically call speed 
2593.09,in the street drug nomenclature. 
2596.39,"Adderall, which goes by various other names, okay? "
2600.96,"So Adderall, Adderall XR, my dialysis, things like that. "
2608.11,Adderall is basically a combination of 
2609.98,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. 
2613.3,"Now some of you probably realize this, "
2615.27,"that Adderall is amphetamine, "
2617.04,"but I'm guessing that there a good number of you out there, "
2619.27,perhaps even parents and kids that don't realize that 
2622.84,"these drugs like cocaine and amphetamine methamphetamine, "
2625.75,which are incredibly dangerous and incredibly habit forming 
2631.34,and have high potential for abuse. 
2633.63,"Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those "
2636.22,are exactly what are used to treat ADHD 
2639.58,"and they're not exactly like cocaine or methamphetamine, "
2641.96,but they are structurally and chemically very similar 
2645.13,and their net effect in the brain and body 
2647.91,"is essentially the same, "
2648.91,"which is to increase dopamine primarily, "
2651.7,but also to increase levels of a neuromodulator 
2654.16,called epinephrin or norepinephrine 
2656.42,also called noradrenaline and adrenaline 
2658.29,those names are the same and to some extent 
2661.0,"to increase levels of serotonin in the brain and blood, "
2663.712,"but not so much serotonin, "
2665.81,"that's just kind of a small smidgen of effect, okay? "
2668.42,So dopamine way up norepinephrine and adrenaline way up. 
2672.86,"So that's motivation drive, focus and energy "
2676.85,"and to some extent, a little bit of serotonin, "
2680.05,which is really more about feeling calm and relaxed 
2684.391,and you can imagine why that would be 
2686.68,a good balancing effect for dopamine and norepinephrine. 
2692.0,So what I'm essentially saying is that the drugs 
2694.01,"that are used to treat ADHD are stimulants, "
2696.96,and they look very much alike. 
2698.463,"In fact, nearly identical to "
2700.93,"some of the so-called street drugs, "
2702.41,stimulants that we all here are so terrible. 
2705.86,"However, I do want to emphasize "
2707.789,that at the appropriate dosages 
2710.18,and working with a quality psychiatrist 
2713.68,or neurologist or family physician 
2716.2,does have to be a board certified MD 
2717.86,"that prescribes these things, "
2719.47,many people with ADHD achieve excellent relief 
2723.84,"with these drugs, not all of them, but many of them do, "
2726.31,especially if these treatments are started early in life. 
2730.21,"So now knowing what these drugs are, "
2732.01,I want to raise the question of why prescribe these drugs? 
2736.47,"I mean, everyone has to make a decision for themselves "
2738.55,or for their child as to whether or not 
2739.79,they're going to take these things or not. 
2742.67,"I also want to acknowledge that many people out there, "
2746.4,"many, many people out there are taking these drugs, "
2749.84,even though they have not been clinically diagnosed 
2752.27,"with ADHD when I say these drugs, "
2754.02,I'm specifically referring to Ritalin and Adderall 
2756.27,"and Modafinil, but more typically it's Adderall, okay? "
2760.12,People using cocaine and amphetamine 
2762.0,"for recreational purposes, "
2763.29,that's a completely different beast 
2765.37,and it is indeed a beast 
2766.51,and it's something that I strongly discourage. 
2770.13,"However, I'm aware that up to "
25%,"of college students, "
2775.54,and perhaps as many as 
35%,of all individuals 
2779.41,between the ages of 
17,and 
30,are taking Adderall 
2785.08,on a regular or semi-regular basis 
2787.16,"in order to work, in order to study "
2790.85,and in order to function and focus in their daily life. 
2793.72,"Even though they have not been diagnosed with ADHD, "
2797.06,there's a whole black market for this. 
2798.34,They're getting it from people with prescriptions. 
2800.11,I'm not here to pass judgment. 
2801.87,I just want to emphasize how these drugs work. 
2804.75,Some of the things that they do to enhance cognition 
2808.047,and focus that actually serve the brain well 
2810.01,in certain individuals and how they can be very detrimental 
2814.51,in other individuals. 
2815.83,I sort of blew right past it. 
2817.18,But the fact that in upwards of 
25%,of young people 
2821.75,"are taking things like Adderall, "
2823.81,despite not having a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. 
2827.95,"Well, that's a ridiculously high number. "
2831.69,"A few years ago, "
2832.6,it was estimated that Adderall use and Ritalin use 
2835.98,without diagnosis of ADHD was second in incident 
2839.69,"only to cannabis, "
2841.59,but actually now the consumption of Adderall 
2845.41,without prescription is higher than 
2849.1,the consumption of cannabis in that age group. 
2851.81,So what that means is that there's a lot of stimulant use 
2855.14,in that age group 
2856.27,and there are a lot of adults also 
2859.09,using and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus. 
2862.18,Then we can have a whole discussion about whether or not 
2863.83,"life is becoming more demanding, "
2865.7,whether or not the need for focus is excessive 
2868.19,and that's why people are doing that. 
2870.04,"But frankly, it's an interesting discussion, "
2871.63,but it's not one that would deliver us to any answers. 
2874.14,"Rather, I'd like to focus on the ways that people now "
2877.167,and people have always been self-medicating 
2879.61,"to increase, focus, right? "
2882.05,"Caffeine, which I can indulge "
2885.13,"some, I don't think to access has long been used "
2888.53,"as a stimulant to increase dopamine, "
2890.41,"increase norepinephrine, "
2891.39,"increased focus and energy and in addition to that, "
2895.23,"it works through the so-called cyclic amp, "
2896.8,"phosphodiesterase pathway, remember anytime you see, "
2900.2,"you hear an ASE, that's an enzyme. "
2902.3,Phosphodiesterase is involved in the 
2904.61,conversion of things like cyclic amp into 
2907.46,energy for cells and so forth. 
2908.82,Basically coffee gives you energy it makes you feel good 
2911.21,and it increases focus because of the circuits 
2914.12,that it engages in the brain. 
2917.39,People have been taking caffeine 
2918.64,and continue to take it caffeine for ages. 
2922.57,"People also used to smoke cigarettes, "
2925.39,nicotine in order to gain focus. 
2927.6,"Nowadays, that's less common because of the concerns, "
2930.282,"quite valid concerns about lung cancer from smoking, "
2934.26,but there's a lot of vaping out there. 
2937.17,"There are a lot of people now consuming nicotine, "
2939.93,which is the active substance in cigarettes 
2942.51,and in most nicotine vapes that stimulates the brain 
2946.93,to be more focused and more alert. 
2949.29,So the idea of taking stimulants of consuming things 
2952.47,or smoking things in order to increase alertness 
2955.67,is not a new idea. 
2957.2,"It's just that in ADHD, "
2960.13,"it's surprising that these things would work, right? "
2962.63,"I mean, if the problem is "
2963.77,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, "
2966.6,"what we're really talking about here, "
2968.32,or children that are prescribed a drug 
2971.89,"that ought to be a stimulant, "
2973.0,it ought to make them hyper hyperactive 
2975.57,"and rather than doing that, "
2976.96,"it actually somehow serves to calm them a bit, "
2980.45,or at least allow them to focus. 
2982.67,"Here's the reason, children have a brain "
2985.87,that's a very plastic meaning it can remodel itself 
2989.77,"and change in response to experience very, very quickly "
2992.62,compared to adults. 
2994.49,"Taking stimulants as a child, "
2996.96,if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD 
3000.11,"allows that forebrain task related network to come online, "
3004.56,to be active at the appropriate times 
3007.46,"and because those children are young, "
3009.71,it allows those children to learn what focus is 
3012.72,and to sort of follow or enter that tunnel of focus. 
3016.88,"Now, by taking a drug, it's creating focus artificially, "
3020.35,it's not creating focus because they're super interested 
3023.26,"in something it's chemically inducing, a state of focus, "
3027.24,and let's face it a lot of childhood and school 
3030.22,and becoming a functional adult 
3031.55,is about learning how to focus 
3032.7,even though you don't want to do something. 
3034.09,"In fact, when I was in college, "
3035.17,I had this little trick that may or may not work 
3037.22,"for some of you, "
3038.33,which is if I couldn't focus on the material 
3040.92,"I was trying to learn, "
3042.35,I would delude myself into thinking 
3044.5,that it was the most interesting thing in the world. 
3046.46,"I would just kind of lie to myself and tell myself, "
3048.49,"okay, this, I won't mention the subjects, "
3052.83,I absolutely love this. 
3054.0,"I would just, I would tell myself that I loved it "
3056.27,and I noticed that just that selective 
3058.98,"or deliberate engagement of that desire to know circuit, "
3063.1,"whatever that is in my brain, no doubt involves dopamine, "
3066.14,allowed me to focus and remember the information 
3068.37,"and somewhat surprisingly or perhaps not surprisingly, "
3071.64,I would often fall in love with the information. 
3073.47,I find that that was my favorite class. 
3074.99,So it was what I wanted to learn the most. 
3077.1,"So that's one way you can do it artificially, "
3079.86,"but kids with ADHD, they can't do that, right? "
3082.0,They're told to sit still 
3083.11,and they end up getting up 
11,times. 
3085.31,They are told that they can't speak out in class 
3088.46,or that they have to remain in their seats for 
10,minutes 
3091.66,"and they just, despite their best effort, "
3093.8,"they simply cannot do it, "
3095.09,they're highly distractable. 
3097.19,So what are we to make of this whole picture 
3099.38,"that we need more dopamine, but these kids with ADHD, "
3102.71,"they're getting their dopamine by way of a drug, "
3105.23,"which is for all the world amphetamines, right? "
3107.97,"It's speed, that's really what it is. "
3110.18,"What are the long-term consequences, "
3111.52,where the short-term consequences and what should we make of 
3115.81,people taking these drugs without a clinical need? 
3118.21,What are the consequences there? 
3120.1,"Well, in order to get to some of those answers, "
3122.36,"I went to one of my colleagues, "
3124.29,this is a colleague that I've actually known 
3125.72,"for a very long time, I was their teaching assistant "
3128.3,"when they were an undergraduate, "
3130.15,"they went on to get an MD, a medical degree, "
3132.98,as well as a PhD and become a pediatric neurologist 
3138.2,that specializes in the treatment of epilepsy 
3141.04,"and ADHD in kids of all ages, from age three to "
"21,",
3145.72,"that's the age range, "
3146.553,pretty broad age range and has extensive knowledge in this 
3150.21,and what makes them particularly interesting for sake of 
3154.53,"this discussion is that they have a child, a young boy, "
3158.21,who's now showing signs of ADHD 
3160.8,and they are on the threshold of trying to decide 
3163.97,whether or not they will prescribe Adderall 
3167.26,or something similar. 
3169.24,So we had a discussion about this 
3171.34,and prior to learning that their child may have ADHD. 
3176.22,I asked the following questions. 
3177.81,"First of all, I asked, "
3178.9,what do you think about giving young kids amphetamine? 
3182.25,"And their answer was, on the face of it, it seems crazy, "
3188.03,but provided that the lowest possible dose is used 
3192.08,and that that dosage is modulating as they grow older 
3195.81,"and develop those powers of attention, "
3198.548,their observation was that they've seen more kids benefit 
3202.73,than not benefit from that. 
3205.54,Now I'm certainly not saying what people should do. 
3207.73,You obviously have to go to a doctor 
3209.16,"because as I always say, I'm not a doctor, "
3211.38,"I don't prescribe anything, "
3212.34,I'm a professor so I profess things 
3214.01,"and here I'm professing that you talk to your doctor, "
3215.95,if you're considering giving Ritalin or Adderall 
3219.15,"or any type of stimulant to your child, of course, "
3221.47,what could be more important than the health of your child. 
3224.04,But it was a very interesting answer because 
3226.09,"typically we hear yes, medicator don't medicate. "
3228.61,Rarely do we hear that the medication should be adjusted 
3231.268,across the lifespan and in any particular kind of way. 
3234.65,"Now the fact that this person, "
3236.38,this now friend of mine and colleague of mine 
3238.966,has so much expertise in the way that the brain works 
3242.487,and is considering putting their child on such medication. 
3246.69,"I said, why wouldn't you wait "
3249.91,until your kid reaches puberty? 
3251.5,"I mean, we know that in boys and in girls, "
3254.69,there are increases in testosterone 
3256.11,"and estrogen during puberty, "
3257.51,that dramatically change the way that the body appears. 
3261.44,But also that dramatically change 
3263.05,"the way that the brain functions in particular we know this, "
3266.7,that puberty triggers the activation of so-called 
3270.58,frontotemporal task related executive functioning. 
3274.02,"That's just fancy science speak for being able to focus, "
3277.27,"being able to direct your attention, "
3278.61,"being able to control your impulses, look at a small child, "
3281.5,"or look at a puppy and then look at an older child, "
3284.3,"or look at a dog, very different levels, "
3286.49,patterns of spontaneous behavior. 
3287.92,"Young children move around a lot they're, "
3289.84,"I don't want to say shifty, "
3290.673,"cause that makes it sound like they're up to something bad, "
3292.57,"which they might be, "
3293.51,"but they don't have to be up to something bad, "
3295.52,they fidget a lot. 
3296.55,"So to puppies, "
3297.383,"everything's a stimulus as animals and humans get older, "
3300.5,"they learn how to control their behavior and sit, still, "
3304.27,listen and focus even if they don't want to. 
3307.57,So giving a drug that allows a child to access that 
3312.38,stillness early on it's thought will allow them 
3316.3,to maintain that ability as time goes on. 
3319.64,"But I decided to push a little bit further, "
3321.57,"I said, well, why would you do it now "
3325.09,as opposed to during puberty or after puberty? 
3328.46,And their answer was very specific 
3330.58,"and I think very important, what they said was look, "
3333.53,neuroplasticity is greatest in childhood 
3337.21,and tapers off after about age 
"25,",
3340.35,but neuroplasticity from age three until age 
12,or 
13,
3345.54,"is exceedingly high and they're right, "
3349.04,when you sit back 
3349.9,"and you look at the literature on neuroplasticity, "
3352.09,you'd say childhood plasticity and young adult plasticity 
3354.67,"is much greater than adult plasticity, "
3357.01,but that early childhood plasticity is far and away 
3360.33,the period in which you can reshape the brain 
3363.46,at an accelerated rate. 
3365.42,So this lines up really well with the clinical literature. 
3368.86,"Not surprisingly, "
3369.693,there are clinician that early treatment is key. 
3373.51,If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physician 
3376.56,"and treat these things early, "
3378.43,"these drugs can allow these frontal circuits, "
3381.13,these task-related circuits to achieve their appropriate 
3384.9,levels of functioning and for kids to learn how to focus 
3387.84,in a variety of different contexts. 
3390.43,"Now, is that the only thing that they should be doing? "
3393.36,Of course not. 
3394.35,So the next question I asked was 
3396.66,"what should we make of all this diet related stuff, right? "
3400.06,I've heard before that the so-called elimination diet 
3404.3,"or ingesting no sugars or no dairy or no gluten, "
3408.86,that all of these things have been purported 
3411.01,to improve symptoms of ADHD and people and parents with ADHD 
3416.04,go to fanatic lanes to try and find the exact foods 
3420.23,that are causing problems and the exact foods 
3423.54,that the kids can eat in order to try 
3425.66,"and get their brain wired up right, "
3427.31,"and correctly, and to avoid lifelong ADHD "
3432.313,and their answer was really interesting. 
3434.11,"But before I tell you their answer, "
3436.08,I want to tell you the studies and the data 
3438.5,related to this question of whether or not food 
3441.76,and the constellation of foods that one avoids 
3444.99,and will eat has anything to do with our levels of attention 
3448.24,"and in particular, "
3449.073,whether or not that can be used as a leverage point 
3451.7,to treat ADHD. 
3453.47,So you can imagine the challenges of exploring the role 
3456.32,"of diet and nutrition in any study, "
3459.15,"but especially in a study on ADHD, why? "
3461.67,"Well, because as I mentioned before, children with ADHD, "
3464.827,and it turns out adults with ADHD 
3466.8,tend to pursue sugary foods or any types of food 
3469.69,that increase their levels of dopamine. 
3471.56,"They are naturally drawn to those foods, "
3473.09,"whether or not they realize it or not, "
3475.3,presumably as a way to try and treat 
3477.16,their lack of focus and impulsivity. 
3480.0,"So in this study that I'm about to share with you, "
3483.35,"there was no drug treatment, it was just a study, "
3485.91,manipulating diet and involved 
100,"children, "
3489.29,
50,"in the so-called elimination diet group, "
3492.43,the special diet where certain foods were eliminated 
3494.65,and 
50,in the so-called control group. 
3496.69,"However, being a well-designed randomized controlled trial, "
3501.42,"this study also included a crossover, "
3503.78,meaning where the kids would serve as their own control 
3507.52,or control group at a certain portion of the study. 
3510.05,So there'll be in one group 
3510.883,where they eliminated certain foods 
3512.17,"and then after a period of time in the study, "
3513.89,they would swap to the other group. 
3515.26,This is a powerful way to design a study 
3517.2,"for reasons that you can imagine, "
3518.47,because you start to eliminate changes and effects 
3521.76,due to individual differences. 
3523.204,"In any case, "
100,children total 
50,in each group 
3526.83,at any one period in time 
3528.28,and the effects that they observed were extremely dramatic. 
3531.766,"In the world of statistics and analysis of scientific data, "
3535.03,"we talk about P-values, probability values. "
3537.21,What's the likelihood that something 
3538.74,could happen according to chance 
3540.1,and typically the cutoff would be 
3541.75,something like P less than 
"0.05,",
3544.36,that's less than 
0.05,"chance essentially, "
3548.73,of the effect being due to chance. 
3551.81,"However, in this study, "
3553.09,every single one of the effects is P less than 
"0.0001,",
3557.52,"very, very infant decimally small "
3559.92,probability that the effect observed could be due to chance. 
3563.35,So what were these effects? 
3564.28,"These effects were enhanced ability to focus, "
3566.99,"less impulsivity, "
3568.296,even less tendency to move when trying to sit still. 
3572.79,So everything from mental focus 
3574.27,to the ability to control their bodies improved 
3576.44,"when they were in the elimination diet group, "
3578.72,what was eliminated? 
3579.69,"Well, the elimination diet in this particular study "
3584.14,was a so-called oligoantigenic diet. 
3587.56,It was a diet in which each kid took a test to determine 
3591.14,"which foods they had antibodies for, "
3593.94,meaning that they were mildly allergic to. 
3596.84,"Now in this study, it was very important "
3598.32,that the kids not be extremely allergic to any food 
3600.65,"because as I mentioned before, "
3601.95,they actually served as a control at one point in the study 
3605.37,"where they were eating all sorts of foods, "
3606.97,including foods that had mild allergies to. 
3608.89,So basically what the study said was that eliminating foods 
3614.48,to which children have allergies 
3616.35,can dramatically improve their symptoms of ADHD. 
3619.77,"And this study, "
3621.05,not surprisingly because it was published 
3622.92,"in such a high quality journal Lancet, et cetera, "
3625.46,large number of subjects set the world on fire. 
3628.85,People were extremely excited about these results 
3632.1,"because here in the absence of any drug treatment, "
3634.466,there was a significant improvement 
3636.32,in ADHD symptoms observed and then came the criticisms. 
3640.9,So many papers were published after this specifically 
3645.44,dealing with re-analysis of these data 
3648.05,and I want to be fair in saying that 
3651.21,"the data in the paper look good, "
3653.41,but there are criticisms 
3655.11,of the overall structural design of the study. 
3657.71,I don't want to go into all the details exactly 
3659.5,'cause it gets really nuanced about some of the statistics 
3662.46,"and the way that one examines these types of data, "
3665.75,but there was skepticism 
3667.6,"and in science, skepticism is healthy, "
3669.44,especially when making decisions about 
3671.16,whether or not to treat or feed children 
3673.45,"one food or another, or give them one drug or another. "
3677.29,"Now I want to return to the story of my friend, "
3679.59,who is a pediatric neurologist and treats ADHD 
3683.24,and has a child who is on the precipice of 
3686.44,perhaps starting to take drugs for the treatment of ADHD. 
3689.45,"I asked the simple question, do you see an effect of diet? "
3693.78,"Meaning when parents control the diet of their children, "
3697.7,does it make a positive or negative or no difference in 
3701.31,"terms of the way that the kids respond to ADHD, "
3704.135,drugs like Ritalin and Adderall or whether or not 
3707.33,it can help them avoid treating with those drugs entirely? 
3709.99,"And her response was very straightforward, she said, "
3713.06,elimination of simple sugars 
3714.94,has a dramatic and positive effect. 
3716.99,She's observed that over and over and over again 
3719.37,"in many dozens, if not hundreds of patients, okay? "
3723.36,"Now that's not a peer reviewed study, "
3724.85,"that's a statement that I'm conveying to you anecdotally, "
3727.15,"but it's a highly, highly informed one. "
3730.16,"I said, what about these elimination diets? "
3732.78,"She said, and I found other sources to support this, "
3735.55,that these oligoantigenic diets are controversial. 
3738.54,There are many people who really believe 
3741.13,in identifying all the things that you're allergic to 
3743.76,and making sure that you 
3745.39,and especially your kids avoid those foods. 
3747.57,"However, there's another camp that's starting to emerge "
3750.63,"in the peer reviewed scientific literature, "
3753.67,showing that when kids are not exposed to certain foods 
3757.59,"in particular nuts and things of that sort, "
3759.849,they develop allergies to those foods 
3762.7,"and then when exposed to them later, "
3764.29,they cause real problems. 
3765.4,So there's a whole galaxy of discussion and controversy 
3768.96,and outright fighting about allergies 
3771.13,and kids and whether or not the oligoantigenic diet 
3773.23,is the appropriate one. 
3774.13,"However, out of the four neurologists and psychiatrists "
3778.43,"that I spoke to about ADHD in preparation for this, "
3781.66,"every single one said children with ADHD, "
3784.67,"as much as possible, "
3785.75,should be encouraged to avoid high sugar 
3788.97,and simple sugar foods of most kinds 
3791.38,and if they can find particular foods 
3794.72,"that exacerbate their symptoms, "
3796.41,obviously eliminating those foods is beneficial 
3800.41,and the foods that exacerbate their symptoms 
3803.61,change over time. 
3805.527,"So I don't like giving a complicated answer, "
3808.75,but I also don't like giving an incomplete answer. 
3811.34,"What this tells me is that children, "
3814.74,especially young children who have ADHD 
3817.93,should probably not eat much sugar 
3821.5,in particular simple sugars. 
3823.25,"In addition to that, "
3824.71,exploring whether or not they have existing allergies 
3827.76,"to foods, they already consume might be a good idea. "
3832.21,"At least that's what this paper, "
3833.87,the Pelsser et. al Lancet paper seems to speak to 
3836.58,and I should mention that that paper was published in 
2011.,
3839.92,Since then there have been many dozens of studies exploring 
3843.62,"the same thing, as well as meta analysis of all those data "
3846.51,and it does appear that diet can have 
3849.36,a highly significant role in eliminating 
3853.25,or at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD 
3855.36,so much so that some of the children 
3857.75,"are able to not take medication at all, "
3859.76,or eventually wean themselves off medication 
3863.0,as young adults and as adults. 
3865.72,One interesting question is whether or not adults 
3868.52,should modify their diet in order to 
3871.48,"increase their levels of focus, "
3872.72,"if they're already having normal levels of focus, "
3875.55,but we'd like more or would like to reduce 
3877.98,"existing adult ADHD, that's an interesting, "
3882.55,"and even more controversial topic, "
3884.77,it brings us right into the realm of what are called 
3887.26,omega-
3,fatty acids. 
3888.64,I've talked many times on this podcast about 
3890.73,the known benefits of omega-
3,"fatty acids in particular, "
3894.53,getting a one gram 
1000,milligrams or more 
3898.71,even as much as 
2000,milligrams each day of 
3901.55,the so-called EPA component of omega-
3,fatty acids 
3906.07,"known to have antidepressant effects, "
3908.63,"mood elevating effects, "
3909.66,known to have important effects 
3913.12,protecting the cardiovascular system. 
3915.6,I think it's now clear that the immune system also benefits 
3918.86,that omega-
3,fatty acids that include a gram or more of EPA 
3924.14,that are very beneficial typically 
3925.91,"that's done through fish oil, "
3927.11,"liquid fish oil is going to be the most cost efficient, "
3929.12,but they're capsule forms 
3930.47,"for those of you that don't like fish oil, "
3933.1,you can ingest this through other means 
3934.33,"you can get it from certain algaes or krill, et cetera. "
3936.96,"You have to make it compatible with your particular diet, "
3940.7,whether or not you're vegan 
3941.533,"or vegetarian or omnivore, et cetera. "
3944.5,Omega-
3s,"have shown, "
3945.6,been shown to have all these positive health benefits. 
3948.49,Do they have positive effects on focus and attention? 
3952.27,And the answer is you can find studies 
3955.05,"that support that statement and the effects are significant, "
3959.35,but the effects are modest. 
3962.39,"You can also find studies that show no effect, "
3966.35,however much like with omega-
3s,"and antidepressants, "
3971.107,whereby ingestion of omega-
3,fatty acids of a gram or 
3977.25,more of EPA per day allows people with major depression 
3980.17,to get away with taking lower doses 
3981.96,of antidepressant medication. 
3983.79,It does seem that ingestion of omega-
3,fatty acids in adults 
3990.22,that include EPA is of 
1000,milligrams or more 
3993.92,can allow adults with ADHD 
3996.05,or mild attention deficit issues 
3998.6,to function well on lower doses of medication 
4003.88,and in rare cases to eliminate medication entirely. 
4007.39,"So what this says is once again, "
4009.4,that the omega-
3,"fatty acids are beneficial, "
4011.63,will they cure or eliminate ADHD? 
4014.81,"I think it's safe to say, no, "
4017.07,they are playing a supportive 
4018.42,or what we call a modulatory role. 
4020.73,"Just like good sleep, "
4022.25,plays a supportive and modulatory role 
4024.36,"for essentially everything, your immune system, "
4026.31,"your ability to think your ability to regulate your emotion, "
4028.5,it's modulating that process. 
4030.83,This component of modulation 
4033.01,is extremely important to highlight 
4034.88,and I think I want to spend a moment on it because 
4037.079,this is especially important in the context of ADHD 
4040.56,and all the information that's out there. 
4042.92,There are biological processes that are mediated 
4046.19,by particular compounds like dopamine. 
4048.94,"So for instance, the ability to feel motivated, "
4051.51,to attend to focus is mediated by the circuits in the brain 
4055.89,that release dopamine. 
4058.44,"However, attention is also modulating by how rested you are. "
4062.73,"If you want to eliminate your ability to think well at all, "
4065.8,just stay up for two nights and don't sleep at all right? 
4068.69,"If you do that, "
4069.74,you will have modulating the circuits in your brain 
4072.35,that respond to various things 
4075.32,and you will be highly distractible. 
4077.02,You'll be highly emotional. 
4078.17,"You will feel like garbage, "
4079.63,"but that doesn't mean that sleep mediates, "
4082.26,focus and attention. 
4083.44,It modulates it indirectly. 
4086.09,"Likewise, I think these omega-"
3,fatty acids 
4089.45,in particular the EPA is which are so beneficial for mood 
4092.37,"and apparently also for attention, "
4094.73,"they directly mediate attention and mood, "
4098.49,"what they do is they modulate those circuits, "
4100.64,they make dopamine more available. 
4103.16,"They make whatever dopamine is available, "
4105.24,more likely to bind to the various receptors 
4108.52,that are present on neurons and so forth 
4110.68,and I think this is very important because likewise diet 
4113.63,in any discussion about nutrition 
4115.3,"has to include this framework of is the diet, "
4118.49,"the elimination diet, "
4119.6,"or whether or not it's some other diet or esoteric diet, "
4122.58,"ketogenic diet, is it modulating or mediating a process? "
4126.16,"And most likely in the context of ADHD, "
4128.81,it's modulating that process. 
4131.0,"So if the ADHD is mild or if it's caught early enough, "
4134.37,or if it's in conjunction with pharmacology 
4137.72,"with a prescription treatment, "
4139.31,"well, then it might help guide the child or adult "
4141.91,to a better place of being able to focus. 
4143.99,But it's not going to be the switch that flips everything. 
4147.17,"Now that does not mean that consuming the wrong foods, "
4150.81,sugary foods or foods that you happen to be allergic to 
4153.16,is a good idea it will still be detrimental. 
4156.1,So I hope that conceptual framework helps 
4158.01,"because if you go online, "
4159.1,if you're somebody with ADHD 
4160.42,"or not your going to be bombarded with the ADHD diet, "
4164.5,"the oligoantigenic diet, the elimination this, "
4167.81,this supplement that EPA 
4169.26,and I think it's very important to understand whether or not 
4171.565,you're talking about something mediating a process 
4174.59,or modulating a process. 
4176.31,"Now drugs like Ritalin, drugs like Adderall, "
4178.88,they are tapping into the circuitries 
4180.26,and the neurochemistries that mediate attention and focus. 
4185.36,They are not the only alternatives or the only choices 
4188.43,rather for treatment of these circuits 
4190.38,and enhancement of the circuits for focus. 
4192.24,I'm going to talk about other alternatives 
4194.01,and some behavioral alternatives 
4196.02,"that are not very well known, "
4197.46,"but are very, very effective in a few minutes. "
4200.96,But I really want to make this clear distinction 
4203.5,"between modulation and mediation, "
4205.64,because it's vital for anyone that's trying to modulate 
4209.17,or mediate anything within their own brain. 
4211.63,"If any of you are interested in this oligoantigenic diet, "
4214.4,"as it relates to ADHD, "
4216.267,and you want to explore a more recent study 
4219.72,besides that classic 
2011,"Lancet study, "
4222.78,that's rather controversial. 
4223.87,There's a paper that was published in frontiers 
4225.97,"in psychiatry just last year, "
2020.,
4229.09,"The title of the paper is, "
4230.47,"""Oligoantigenic diet improves children's ADHD "
4233.45,"rating scale scores reliably in added video rating."" "
4237.76,The added video rating is just that they're using 
4239.59,an additional measure of focus and attention. 
4243.3,"Again, that's Frontiers in psychiatry, "
"2020,",
4246.22,"I'll put a link to it in the caption, "
4248.29,and that's a more recent study for you to peruse. 
4251.11,So we've talked about the neural circuits of focus 
4253.14,"and the chemistry of focus, "
4255.24,but we haven't talked yet about what would make us better 
4259.44,at focusing and what focusing better really is. 
4262.01,So let's take a step back and think about 
4265.14,how we focus and how to get better at focus 
4267.86,and I'm going to share with you a tool for which there are 
4271.05,terrific research data 
4273.33,that will allow you in a single session 
4275.72,to enhance your ability to focus in theory forever. 
4282.05,What am I about to read you is from an excellent book 
4284.57,"that I recommend, "
4285.73,if any of you are interested in neuroscience 
4287.41,and things like meditation and default mode networks 
4290.53,"and things of that sort, "
4292.482,"the book is called, ""Altered Traits."" "
4295.55,"Science reveals how meditation changes your mind, "
4297.95,"brain and body and no, I'm not going to try "
4300.41,and convince you to meditate. 
4301.8,I'm going to share with you a small passage in the book 
4304.57,that relates some research data related to focus 
4307.41,that are very important. 
4308.71,"If you want to meditate, that's your choice. "
4310.64,That's a separate matter. 
4311.48,This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson 
4314.34,and I should just mention that 
4315.99,Goleman is a well-known author 
4317.7,has written books on emotional intelligence and so forth. 
4320.86,Richard Davidson is also a PhD. 
4324.12,"He's a professor of psychology and psychiatry, "
4326.55,"and he's at a University of Wisconsin Madison, "
4329.55,he's done terrific work on brain states 
4332.31,and modulation of brain states and so forth. 
4335.92,What we're about to talk about is 
4337.53,when attention works and when attention falters 
4341.95,and what we are specifically going to talk about 
4344.09,"are what are called attentional blinks, "
4346.81,not actual eye blinks. 
4348.07,"We're going to talk about that in a few minutes, "
4349.82,but we're going to talk about attentional blinks. 
4353.069,I'm paraphrasing here because 
4356.75,Goleman and Davidson wrote about this so beautifully. 
4359.23,I'd rather paraphrase from them than try and just 
4361.37,make up a new way to say it 
4362.84,"that is less interesting or less good, "
4365.0,but I want to credit them. 
4366.617,"Attentional blinks are really easy to understand, "
4368.87,"if you think about a where's Waldo task, "
4370.82,"you know this task where's Waldo where, "
4373.02,there are a bunch of people and objects 
4374.96,and things in a picture 
4376.19,and somewhere in there is Waldo 
4377.67,"with the striped hat and the glasses and go skinny dude, "
4380.73,and you have to find Waldo 
4382.39,and so it's a visual search 
4383.86,and it's visual search for an object 
4386.24,"that has distinct features, "
4387.34,but is embedded in this ocean of other things that 
4390.97,could easily be confused as Waldo. 
4392.75,"So you tend to look, look, "
4393.583,"look, look, look, look, look, look, look, "
4394.89,and then you find Waldo. 
4396.6,Kids can do this they enjoy doing this. 
4398.26,"Adults may or may not enjoy it, "
4399.73,but they can do it too. 
4401.16,"They find Waldo, when you find Waldo "
4404.22,or when you search for a target 
4406.17,"in some other visual search task at that moment, "
4409.35,your nervous system celebrates a little bit 
4411.97,and it celebrates through the release of neurochemicals 
4414.76,"that make you feel good, you found it and you pause. "
4418.3,"Now, the pause is interesting because when you pause, "
4421.81,what we know from many experiments is that 
4425.16,"in that moment of pause and mild celebration, "
4428.81,"however, mild you are not able to see another Waldo "
4434.32,sitting right next to it. 
4436.17,So what this means is in attending to something 
4439.41,in searching and in identifying a visual target 
4443.99,your attention blinked it shut off for a second 
4447.22,and there's a more formal and more laboratory type 
4450.97,way that we look at this. 
4453.26,The more typical way to do this is to give someone 
4456.64,a string of letters or a string of numbers 
4459.53,and beforehand you tell them be on the lookout for the 
4463.7,"letters R and Z, okay? "
4467.35,You're just going to watch this string of numbers go by 
4470.11,"and there will be a letter R in there, "
4471.88,and there will be a letter Z in there 
4473.8,and try and spot them both 
4476.76,and what you find is when you present 
4478.74,"that string of numbers, and then they see the R, "
4482.27,they see the R they register it consciously 
4485.917,"and they tend to miss the Z, "
4488.93,just like in the Waldo type example. 
4491.44,"Now, of course the numbers are going by pretty quickly, "
4493.61,but they can spot the R. 
4496.22,"They could also spot the Z, "
4497.62,"if you told them beforehand, just spot the Z "
4500.73,and the numbers are moving through at the same rate 
4502.78,in both conditions. 
4503.613,"So what that means is that in every case, "
4505.95,you are capable of seeing the R or the Z 
4510.26,it's when you try and see both that seeing the first one 
4513.99,"prevents you from seeing the second one, "
4516.45,it's what we call an attentional blink. 
4519.21,We do this all the time 
4521.01,and people with ADHD tend to have many more 
4525.46,attentional blinks than people that don't 
4527.56,and this is true for children and for adults. 
4530.77,This is an important point. 
4532.09,So important that I want to emphasize it twice 
4534.09,in case you attentionally blinked. 
4536.57,"If you see something that you're looking for, "
4539.09,"or you're very interested in something, "
4540.89,you are definitely missing other information 
4545.13,in part because you're over focusing on something 
4547.96,and this leads to a very interesting hypothesis 
4550.32,"about what might go wrong in ADHD, "
4553.44,where we've always thought that they cannot focus 
4556.55,and yet we know they can focus on things 
4558.36,"they care very much about, "
4560.45,"well, maybe just maybe "
4563.06,they are experiencing more attentional blinks 
4566.18,than people who do not have ADHD 
4569.04,"and indeed, there are data now to support the possibility "
4572.47,that that's actually what's happening 
4574.24,and that should be exciting to anyone that has ADHD. 
4576.93,It should also be exciting to anyone that cares about 
4578.99,increasing their focus and their ability to attend. 
4582.13,"What this is saying is that these circuits, "
4583.78,that underlie focus in our ability to attend 
4586.41,"and our ability to eliminate distraction, "
4590.05,they aren't just failing to focus. 
4592.11,That's just a semantic way of describing the outcome. 
4595.47,They are over focusing on certain things 
4597.64,and thereby missing other things. 
4599.61,And so our distractability or the distractability 
4602.65,of somebody with ADHD could exist because 
4606.28,they are over focusing on certain elements 
4609.43,and there are there for missing 
4611.22,other elements that they should be attending to. 
4613.94,So what they really need is this property 
4617.54,that we call open monitoring. 
4619.07,Now open monitoring is something 
4620.72,that's described in the book that I just referred to 
4622.84,and that typically is associated with people 
4625.42,"who have done a lot of meditation, "
4627.58,"so called Vipassana meditation, "
4629.25,or have spent a lot of time learning how to 
4632.35,do what's called open gaze visual analysis 
4635.31,and open gaze thinking. 
4636.33,But there's a simpler version of this 
4637.78,that allows us to bypass all that. 
4639.76,"First of all, "
4642.93,your visual system has two modes of processing. 
4646.77,"It can be highly focused, a soda straw view. "
4648.92,So looking for the R in this string of numbers 
4651.39,"in the example that I just gave, "
4653.05,or if you're very excited about something 
4655.006,"you're in that soda straw view of the world, "
4656.46,"and you're missing other things, okay, "
4658.01,that's high levels of attention. 
4660.35,"However, there's also a property of your visual system "
4663.39,"that allows you to dilate your gaze, "
4665.07,to be in so-called panoramic vision. 
4667.34,"Panoramic vision is something you can do right now, "
4669.41,"no matter where you are, and I can do it right now, "
4671.94,"you won't know that I'm doing it, "
4673.25,"but even though I'm still looking directly at you, "
4676.42,I'm consciously dilating my gaze so that I can see the 
4679.06,"ceiling, the floor and the walls all around me. "
4681.18,That panoramic vision is actually mediated by 
4683.71,a separate stream or set of neural circuits 
4686.9,going from the eye into the brain 
4688.49,and it's a stream or set of circuits 
4690.97,that isn't just wide angle view. 
4693.22,It also is better at processing things in time. 
4696.28,Its frame rate is higher. 
4698.2,"So you've seen slow motion video, "
4700.12,"and you've seen standard video, "
4701.78,"slow motion video gives you that slow motion look, "
4706.65,because it's a higher frame rate. 
4708.07,"You're thin slicing time, okay? "
4712.3,You can use panoramic vision to access the state 
4715.44,that we call open monitoring. 
4716.72,"When people do that, "
4718.38,they are able to attend to and recognize 
4722.5,multiple targets within this string of numbers. 
4726.13,They can see the R and they can see the Z 
4728.23,and they can see additional things. 
4730.18,So this is something that can be trained up 
4732.69,and people can practice whether or not 
4734.04,they have ADHD or not. 
4736.17,What involves is learning 
4737.59,"how to dilate your gaze consciously, "
4739.03,"that's actually quite easy for most people, "
4741.47,whether or not you wear corrective lenses 
4743.44,or contacts or not 
4744.44,you can consciously go into open gaze 
4746.29,and then you can contract your field of view as well. 
4749.288,There have also been studies done 
4751.38,where people were taught to think in a particular way 
4755.98,"for a very short period of time, "
4757.82,and that forever changed their ability to limit 
4761.52,or reduce the number of these attentional blinks. 
4764.33,There are now published accounts in the literature 
4766.05,of a simple practice done for about 
15,"minutes, "
4769.85,where subjects were asked to just sit quietly eyes closed 
4773.02,"and do what is sort of akin to meditation, "
4775.1,but to not direct their mind 
4776.38,"into any particular state or place, "
4778.38,but simply to think about their breathing 
4780.6,"and to focus on their so-called interoception, "
4782.7,"focus on how their body feels, "
4784.28,"their mind drifted to bring it back, okay? "
4786.2,So it's basically meditation for about 
15,minutes. 
4790.24,That might not seem like a significant or unusual practice 
4793.66,or that it would have any impact at all. 
4795.95,"But remarkably, just doing that once for "
17,"minutes, "
4801.86,significantly reduced the number of attentional blinks 
4805.19,that people would carry out. 
4806.61,"In other words, their focus got better "
4808.56,in a near permanent way without any additional training. 
4812.072,There's something about that practice of reducing the amount 
4815.44,of visual information coming in 
4817.2,"and learning to pay attention to one's internal state, "
4819.61,"what we call interoception that allow them an awareness, "
4823.13,"such that when they needed to look for visual targets, "
4826.09,"when they need to focus on multiple things in sequence, "
4829.05,they didn't experience 
4830.56,the same number of attentional blinks 
4832.56,and I should mention not incidentally as people age 
4836.15,and their working memory gets worse 
4838.25,"and their ability to focus gets worse, "
4840.9,the number of attentional blinks 
4842.47,"that they carry out goes up, "
4844.22,and there are now studies exploring whether or not 
4846.51,the simple meditation like practice of 
15,to 
20,minutes 
4850.42,or so of sitting and just quietly resting 
4853.34,and paying attention to one's breathing 
4854.73,and internal state can also offset some of that 
4857.32,age-related what is called cognitive decline. 
4861.41,So what these data tell me is that 
4863.85,regardless of whether or not you're a child 
4865.925,"or you're an adult, "
4867.15,"whether or not you have ADHD or not, "
4869.93,whether or not you're experiencing 
4871.18,"age-related cognitive decline, "
4872.73,or you would simply like to avoid 
4874.26,"age-related cognitive decline, "
4876.92,a simple practice of taking 
17,minutes 
4880.67,"sitting and paying attention to your internal state, "
4883.78,"just interocepting, registering your breathing, "
4887.02,registering the contact of your skin 
4889.18,"with whatever surface you're on, "
4891.26,can forever rewire your brain to be able to attend better 
4895.6,and possibly even offset 
4897.42,some of that age related attentional drift. 
4901.46,"Now, I don't expect anyone to start meditating regularly. "
4904.93,"I don't expect anyone to do anything they don't want to do, "
4907.53,but I think most of us could handle 
4909.7,one meditation's session of 
17,minutes or so 
4913.54,and so if ever there was a tool that stood to rewire 
4916.29,our attentional circuitry in a powerful way. 
4919.06,This seems to be it 
4920.75,"and in addition, the ability to engage in panoramic vision, "
4925.57,"to dilate our gaze, "
4926.64,the so-called open monitoring that allows the brain 
4930.03,to function in a way 
4930.863,"that it can detect more information faster, "
4933.24,that's a powerful tool as well 
4934.7,and the beauty of that tool is that it works the first time 
4937.2,and it works every time. 
4939.05,"Now, how exactly it works is a little bit unclear. "
4943.387,"Is it for instance, "
4945.93,orchestrating this synchrony or asynchrony 
4949.12,between the default mode network 
4950.61,and the task related networks we don't know. 
4952.75,Those studies have not yet been carried out. 
4955.37,"Nonetheless, the effects are significant, "
4957.65,they are long lasting and they appear to exist 
4960.93,after just one session of this quiet 
4963.82,
17,"minute interoception, "
4965.76,which to me makes it seem like 
4966.99,a very worthwhile thing to do for everybody. 
4969.83,"So we just talked about attentional blinks, "
4971.97,which are essentially blinks of thinking 
4974.36,it's your mind shutting off for a moment 
4976.52,and missing information. 
4978.69,"Now let's talk about actual blinks, "
4980.8,the sort that you do with your eyelids. 
4983.09,"Now, this might come across as somewhat obvious, "
4985.55,"but you can do fast, what are called spontaneous blinks "
4990.05,and they're always coordinated between the two eyes 
4992.84,or you can do long blinks 
4994.1,"like when you go to sleep at night, "
4995.59,"you do one very long blink, and I'm not being facetious. "
4999.52,"When you go to sleep at night, "
5000.51,you are shutting your eyelids 
5003.437,and you are limiting the amount of information coming in 
5007.53,and your perception of time starts to drift 
5010.49,as you go into sleep. 
5011.69,"Your perception of time changes from very fast, "
5015.86,at one moment to very slow meaning the frame rate 
5020.18,"at which you are analyzing information dreaming, et cetera, "
5024.81,"is variable when you were in sleep, "
5026.75,sometimes it's very fast. 
5028.2,Meaning you experienced things in slow motion. 
5029.86,Sometimes it's very fast. 
5031.14,In waking to your experience of time 
5035.99,can sometimes be very fast sometimes be very slow. 
5038.6,"Typically the more alert you are, the higher the frame rate, "
5041.803,your thin slicing your experience. 
5045.15,You've probably had this happen. 
5046.41,If you're ever very stressed 
5047.48,"and you're waiting for something or somebody, "
5049.9,it seems like it takes forever because 
5052.85,your frame rate is higher 
5054.07,you're analyzing time more finely. 
5056.46,"Conversely, if you are very relaxed or even sleepy, "
5061.09,you wake up and you have to think of 
5062.21,all the things you have to do. 
5063.043,"It will seem like the world is going by very, very fast "
5065.72,and that you are moving very slow. 
5068.04,"Time is going at the same rate, "
5070.36,but your perception of time is what's changed. 
5073.62,Believe it or not. 
5075.05,Your perception of time is also changed on a rapid basis. 
5079.27,Moment to moment basis by how often you blink. 
5084.28,This is a well-established literature 
5086.82,in the world of neuroscience that unlike the literature 
5091.05,"and claims about blinking and sociopathy, "
5093.75,"which have no basis, "
5095.69,the science of blinking as it relates to time perception 
5099.05,has some very good data to support it. 
5101.27,"I want to just emphasize one study in particular, "
5103.98,"which is quite appropriately titled, "
5106.447,"""Time dilates after spontaneous blinking."" "
5109.1,This is a paper that was published in current biology. 
5111.52,"The first author is Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E. "
5115.108,It's a wonderful paper. 
5117.54,They examine the relationship between fluctuations in timing 
5122.84,and blinking and to make a long story short 
5126.21,"what they found is that right after blinks, "
5129.96,"we reset our perception of time, okay? "
5133.57,So blinks in that sense are a little bit like 
5136.13,the curtain coming down on a scene 
5138.15,between scenes in a play 
5140.12,"or takes in a movie, and they clap the clap thing, "
5143.21,"they started take in our, what do they say, action "
5146.82,and then at the end they do the thing and they click it down 
5149.66,"and they say, it's a take that's one take "
5152.55,"when you blink it's a take, okay? "
5156.65,Now what's interesting 
5158.26,and will immediately make sense to you as to why 
5161.15,this is important is that the rate of blinking 
5165.68,is controlled by dopamine. 
5168.35,So what this means is that dopamine 
5170.25,is controlling attention. 
5171.53,"Blinks relate to attention and focus, "
5174.28,and therefore the dopamine and blinking system is one way 
5177.81,that you constantly modulate and update 
5181.87,your perception of time 
5183.83,"and fortunately, it's also one that you can control. "
5187.07,So the basic takeaway of this study was that blinking 
5189.98,"controls time perception, "
5191.21,but also that levels of dopamine 
5193.84,"can alter your sense of time and stay with me here, "
5198.32,and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked. 
5202.93,They are working together to control your attention. 
5206.06,"When dopamine levels go up, "
5208.48,"people tend to overestimate how long something lasted, why? "
5213.62,Because they are processing time more finely 
5216.28,it's slow motion mode. 
5219.24,"When dopamine levels are lower, "
5221.07,they tend to underestimate time intervals. 
5224.45,"Let's remember back to the very beginning of the episode, "
5227.23,"what's going on in people with ADHD, "
5230.42,"they are not good at managing their time, "
5232.62,"they tend to run late, or they are disorganized. "
5235.13,"They are not just disorganized in space, "
5237.78,"meaning in that physical space, around them, "
5240.348,they're disorganized in time. 
5243.59,"Their dopamine is low, we know that as well "
5246.77,and so they are underestimating time intervals 
5249.63,and so it makes perfect sense that they would be late. 
5252.14,It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of time 
5254.5,or the ability to focus. 
5256.66,This is really exciting because what it means is that 
5259.71,"children with ADHD, adults, with ADHD "
5262.34,or people with normal levels of focus 
5264.16,that want to improve their ability to focus 
5266.93,can do so through a training that involves 
5270.23,"learning how often to blink and when, "
5273.15,and how to keep their visual focus on a given target 
5276.86,and it turns out this study has actually been done. 
5279.93,"There's a study again, I'll link to the study, "
5282.26,"entitled ""Improvement of attention "
5284.14,in elementary school students 
5286.04,"through fixation focused training activity."" "
5288.74,"I won't go through all the details, "
5290.22,but what they found was a short period of 
5294.3,"focusing on a visual target, "
5296.8,allowed the school children to greatly enhance 
5300.04,their ability to focus on other types of information 
5303.65,and a significant component of the effect was due 
5306.11,to the way that they were controlling the shutters 
5308.39,"on their eyes, their eyelids, and controlling their blinks. "
5311.73,So what they did in this study is they had these kids 
5314.24,focus their visual attention 
5315.76,"on some object that was relatively close, "
5318.04,"like their hand for a minute or so, "
5320.67,"which actually takes some effort if you try and do that, "
5322.89,they were allowed to blink. 
5324.758,"However, it's known from other work "
5327.7,"that if people can consciously override the desire to blink, "
5331.179,"at least to the point where they feel like they have to, "
5334.01,"or else their eyes were dry out, "
5335.49,that actually can increase attention even further 
5338.57,and they had conditions where they would look at a point 
5340.98,further across the room and even further across the room. 
5344.314,It only took a few minutes each day to do this 
5347.39,
30,"seconds in one condition, or maybe a minute "
5349.73,and then at another station 
5351.21,of looking a little bit further out 
5352.247,"and a little bit further out, however, "
5354.17,there was an important feature of this study 
5356.43,"that is definitely worth mentioning, "
5358.6,which is before they did this 
5360.55,"visual focus, task or training, "
5363.87,they did a series of physical movements with the kids 
5367.41,so that the kids could sort of eliminate or move out 
5370.53,some of their desire to move 
5372.62,and would thereby enhance their ability to sit still. 
5376.39,"Now it's long been known that kids need a recess, "
5378.78,"they need time to run around and play and roll around, "
5381.42,do whatever it is that they do 
5382.48,in order to be able to sit still at all. 
5384.85,"Adults probably need this too, frankly, "
5386.47,but kids need it more because the circuits in the brain 
5389.75,"that control reflexive movements and as we say, "
5393.87,"kind of rhythmic undulating behavior and things like that, "
5397.1,that's an active suppression 
5398.74,and kids have less of that circuitry built up 
5400.81,until they hit about age 
15,or 
16.,
5403.97,So they had the kids move around a bit 
5406.18,and then do this focus training. 
5408.54,That brings me to another treatment 
5410.61,"that's actively used nowadays in schools for kids with ADHD, "
5414.42,but also is starting to be used by many kids 
5418.45,and by parents in order to keep their kids focusing 
5422.5,and not going crazy in the car or not acting out in general 
5427.5,and that's the prevalence of these so-called fidgeter toys 
5431.14,or things that kids can do actively 
5432.88,and repetitively in order to move out 
5434.61,some of their underlying reverberatory activity 
5437.97,in their nervous system. 
5439.32,So what you will find is that some kids with ADHD 
5443.01,"are now given a rubber band on their desk, "
5445.68,literally a rubber band that's attached to their desk 
5447.48,"and they're able to pull on it, "
5449.2,"even snap it against the desk, "
5450.63,"if I had done that when I was a kid, "
5451.69,"I think my teachers were throw me out of class, "
5453.42,but I think it's great that they're allowing them 
5454.91,to do this now as a way of moving 
5457.53,some of their physical energy out 
5460.68,"or engage their physical energy, rather, "
5463.16,as opposed to trying to sit 
5464.8,statue still all the time and attend 
5466.93,and it turns out that does enhance these children's ability 
5470.13,to focus mentally when they have some physical activity 
5472.82,to attend to and it turns out it also can work for adults. 
5476.98,I'll share with you I related anecdote 
5479.16,because it illustrates the underlying mechanism. 
5481.342,I've had the great privilege of being able to do a number of 
5485.37,"surgeries, brain surgeries during my career. "
5488.52,"So one thing you find when you do brain surgeries, "
5490.213,is that the brain's pretty small 
5492.122,regardless of the species that you're working on 
5493.988,and you're in there and you're trying to do 
5495.36,something very specific and the more you try 
5498.14,"and hold your hands really steady, "
5500.46,"the more they want to shake, all right? "
5502.5,So it's not natural for any of our limbs 
5504.65,"to sit perfectly still, "
5506.8,"depending on how much coffee you had, "
5508.18,how well rested you are 
5509.72,and your sort of baseline level of autonomic arousal. 
5512.1,"Some of you may find that you can hold out your hand, "
5514.29,"absolutely rock solid, others will shake a little bit more. "
5518.4,"It doesn't mean you're if you're shaking, "
5519.87,doesn't mean you're calm if you're still. 
5523.46,What it relates to 
5524.73,"is the amount of what we call premotor activity, "
5526.64,the number of commands to move 
5528.37,that are being sent through the system 
5529.72,and that's what I mean by reverberatory activity 
5532.01,and it does seem that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD 
5536.01,have a lot of reverberatory activity 
5538.47,in their nervous system 
5539.327,and so that's that constant desire to move 
5541.15,it's hard for them to sit still 
5542.84,"and therefore it's hard for them to attend, "
5544.92,to harness their attention. 
5547.599,When you do a surgery 
5549.11,"and you find that your hands are shaking, "
5552.045,"what you learn from your mentors, "
5553.88,"which I did and what works extremely well, "
5556.13,"whether or not you're doing a surgery or not, "
5557.8,is that you simply tap your foot 
5559.55,"or you bounce your knee a little bit, "
5560.96,"which you might think would make your hand shake even more, "
5564.24,but provided that it's subtle. 
5565.96,What it does is it actually shuttle some of the activity 
5569.22,from those premotor circuits to elsewhere in the body 
5571.98,"and then you're able to sit much more still with your hand, "
5575.13,you're able to perform the surgery with much more precision. 
5577.72,You are able to write with much better handwriting 
5580.46,"and for those of you who engage in public speaking, "
5583.6,"if you ever too nervous, "
5584.84,that's why pacing while you public speak helps 
5587.02,"if you're nervous, "
5587.853,that's why bouncing your knee behind the podium 
5590.15,works as well. 
5590.983,That's why nodding your head and gesticulating can help. 
5593.34,"It's not a matter of, "
5595.557,"""Moving energy out of the body."" "
5597.1,"That doesn't actually happen, "
5598.4,what it is you're engaging those premotor circuits 
5600.97,that are sending through commands. 
5602.36,"It's like trying to stuff, "
5603.4,"a bunch of stuff through a funnel, "
5605.05,"and it creates this tension, "
5606.67,so you're giving it an outlet for the neural circuitry 
5611.01,to be able to move something 
5612.37,so that you can keep other components of your body 
5614.64,and your mental attention engaged 
5617.51,and locked onto something what we call focus. 
5621.0,One thing related to this whole business of blinking 
5623.26,and focus and training yourself to focus 
5625.52,"and not blinking, et cetera, is that most all of the drugs, "
5631.08,"Ritalin, Adderall, and recreational drugs "
5633.71,"that increase dopamine, "
5635.15,"even coffee and tea and other forms of caffeine, "
5639.51,they tend to make us blink less 
5641.76,"and when we get tired, we tend to blink more. "
5644.56,"Now this is sort of a duh, right? "
5647.27,But being wide-eyed with excitement or fear 
5650.59,"or with your eyes, barely being able to keep them open, "
5655.37,now it should make perfect sense that these shutters 
5657.59,"on the front of your eyes, "
5658.5,they aren't just there for winking 
5660.34,and they aren't just there for cosmetic purposes. 
5662.98,They are there to regulate the amount of information 
5666.32,going into your nervous system 
5667.71,and they're there to regulate how long 
5671.14,you are bringing information into your nervous system 
5674.0,"and in what bins, how widely or finely "
5677.75,you are binning time is set by how often you blink 
5680.96,and how widely or specifically 
5684.44,you are grabbing attention from the visual world is set 
5686.78,by whether or not you're viewing things very specifically 
5688.92,"like a cross area through a soda straw view like this, "
5691.81,or whether or not you were in this panoramic 
5694.05,"sort of whole environment mode, "
5697.2,this kind of fisheye lens or wide angle lens mode 
5700.54,"and in fairness to the pharmacology and the circuitry, "
5704.12,while dopamine and heightened levels of alertness 
5707.78,and excitement tend to make us blink less and attend more. 
5712.84,There's actually a study that's looked at 
5714.58,the other neurochemical systems 
5716.89,and drugs and how those relate to blinking 
5719.41,and so this will all be obvious by the title of the paper 
5722.19,I'm about to share with you. 
5723.1,"This is a paper entitled, "
5725.217,"""Decreased spontaneous eyeblink rates "
5727.96,"in chronic cannabis users, "
5729.97,"evidence for stride or cannabinoid, dopamine interactions."" "
5734.15,"Okay, I'm not going to go into all the details here, "
5736.13,but one thing that is somewhat surprising is that 
5740.05,"many people with ADHD use or abuse cannabis, "
5745.54,"you might think, well, why would they do that? "
5747.11,Because I thought that a increase in dopamine 
5750.55,is actually what's going to lead 
5751.56,to heightened levels of attention 
5752.73,and that's what these people in children crave. 
5755.21,"Well, it turns out that cannabis also "
5757.79,"increases dopamine transmission in the brain, "
5760.77,"but because of the other chemicals, "
5762.87,it increases namely serotonin 
5764.51,"and some components of the cannabinoid and opioid system, "
5767.53,"it creates that kind of alert, but mellow feel "
5773.13,"and again, here I'm not a proponent of this, "
5775.53,I personally am not a THC or cannabis user. 
5778.02,It's just not my thing 
5780.12,and obviously it's illegal some places 
5781.81,and so you have to determine that for yourself 
5784.04,"it does have medical purposes in some places it is legal, "
5788.38,but THC increases dopamine and increases neurochemicals 
5792.24,that can also create a state of calm. 
5794.14,So it's that sort of middle ground 
5795.97,and this paper has a beautiful demonstration 
5798.5,"whereby not just while people are using cannabis, "
5802.53,but depending on how long they've been using 
5804.93,"cannabis across their lifespan, "
5806.88,the rates of eye blinking change. 
5809.16,So if you look at the number of years 
5811.9,"that people have been using cannabis on a regular basis, "
5814.86,"either daily or up to excuse me, weekly, or up to daily, "
5818.66,what you find is that for people 
5820.68,"that have not been using cannabis at all, "
5822.76,"or have only been using it for about two years, "
5825.53,their rates of eye blinks are much higher 
5828.26,than people who've been using it chronically for 
10,years. 
5830.64,"In other words, people "
5831.8,who may be using cannabis for 
10,"years, "
5833.42,don't blink very often at all. 
5835.44,"Now cannabis has well known effects in depleting memory, "
5839.53,but it does seem to engage the focus 
5842.67,and blinking system in a way that increases focus. 
5845.63,So basically what I'm saying is 
5847.31,"marijuana seems to increase people's focus, "
5849.25,but then they can't remember what they were focusing on. 
5852.1,Something I'd like to discuss just briefly is the so-called 
5855.45,"interoceptive awareness that's present in people with ADHD, "
5859.52,both children and adults. 
5860.97,Interoceptive awareness is one sense 
5863.69,"of one's own internal state heartbeat, "
5866.46,"breathing contact of skin with a given surface, et cetera. "
5870.59,"For a long time, there was this hypothesis, "
5872.82,"this idea that people with ADHD, "
5874.97,were just not in touch with how they felt 
5877.61,that somehow they weren't registering 
5879.41,all the stuff that was going on inside them 
5881.44,changes in heart rate and so forth 
5882.99,and so they were behaving in a way 
5884.9,"that was dysregulated or appear dysregulated, "
5888.79,and that if they could just learn to attend 
5891.4,"to their internal state better, "
5893.24,that somehow they would function better in the world. 
5896.32,"Now, before we described a process, "
5899.34,literally a 
17,minute interoceptive exercise 
5903.11,that does seem to lead to improvements 
5905.86,in one's ability to focus for a longer period of time. 
5909.94,"However, it's very unlikely that that was due to "
5914.2,increasing interoceptive awareness per se. 
5917.37,It probably wasn't because people gain a much heightened 
5921.42,or improved ability to understand 
5924.25,what's going on internally. 
5926.16,"In fact, you can imagine how that might actually "
5927.95,prevent one's ability to pay attention to things 
5929.96,in the outside world. 
5931.49,So while there is benefit to just sitting there 
5933.67,"and being in stillness, as they say, "
5935.38,or focusing on one's breathing and internal state 
5937.91,for sake of then accessing information 
5940.38,"in the external world, "
5941.93,a really nice study called interoceptive awareness 
5946.52,and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
5948.62,explored whether or not interoceptive awareness 
5951.14,was different in people with ADHD or did not have ADHD 
5955.832,and the findings were essentially that there's no difference 
5960.2,"that people with ADHD, children, and adults, "
5962.46,they are aware of what's going on inside them 
5965.35,just as much as anyone else's 
5967.55,and the typical measure of interoceptive awareness 
5969.87,is one's ability to count their own heartbeats. 
5973.14,This is actually challenging for some individuals 
5976.06,"and very easy for other individuals, "
5977.89,regardless of their attentional capacity. 
5979.66,Some people just can really feel their heartbeat 
5981.87,without taking their pulse other people cannot 
5985.02,and these studies are pretty straightforward to do. 
5987.41,"You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats, "
5990.82,and then you are monitoring their heartbeats 
5992.7,and you get to gauge how accurate they are. 
5995.14,So it's important to understand that people with ADHD 
5998.98,are in touch with how they feel. 
6001.56,It's really a question of whether or not 
6003.7,they can take the demands that are placed upon them 
6006.76,and enter a cognitive state of mental state 
6009.43,that allows them to access the information 
6011.22,they need to access 
6012.053,"in other words, whether or not they can focus, "
6013.3,but it is absolutely wrong to think that 
6015.86,the child that's getting up 
11,times during a short 
6019.498,"six minute interaction at the table, "
6021.66,or whether or not a child who 
6024.46,somehow has to venture off every moment 
6026.27,or a coworker of yours 
6027.64,who's an adult who's constantly fidgeting 
6029.43,or moving things around that somehow they are unaware 
6031.5,"that they are oblivious, "
6032.41,they're not oblivious to how they feel. 
6034.26,Chances are they're very challenged in the situations 
6036.52,that they're in 
6037.353,and they're doing everything they can to try 
6038.86,and regulate their attention. 
6040.41,So I think it's an important study to highlight 
6042.428,because it really underscores the fact that 
6044.76,something else is going on 
6046.17,and that something else has everything to do 
6048.32,with this ability to coordinate 
6049.6,"these tasks directed networks, "
6051.22,and to coordinate that in the proper way 
6053.93,with that default mode network 
6055.7,"and that is a process as you now know, "
6058.12,that's regulated exquisitely by certain neurochemicals 
6062.51,"and in particular the neurochemicals, dopamine, "
6064.74,"norepinephrine and serotonin, "
6067.13,"and a fourth one I'd like to throw into the mix, "
6069.04,"which is acetylcholine, "
6070.38,which is very vital for cognitive focus. 
6073.0,So now I want to switch back to talking about 
6075.41,some of the drugs that are typically used 
6077.57,"to access those systems, prescription drugs "
6079.8,and I want to talk about some of the new and emerging 
6082.07,non-prescription approaches 
6083.93,"to increasing the levels of dopamine, "
6085.99,acetylcholine and serotonin in the brain 
6088.13,"using various supplement type compounds, "
6090.24,because several of them are showing 
6092.75,really remarkable efficacy 
6094.77,in excellent peer reviewed studies. 
6096.74,So before moving to some of the newer atypical compounds 
6099.77,"and things sold over the counter, "
6101.569,I'd like to just briefly return to the classic drugs 
6106.3,that are used to treat ADHD. 
6109.6,"These are the ones I mentioned earlier, "
6111.59,"methylphenidate also called Ritalin, "
6114.64,"Modafinil or armodafinil is another one and Adderall, "
6120.46,"again, all of these work by "
6122.19,increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. 
6125.53,"Typically they're taken orally in pill form, "
6128.534,or sometimes in capsule form 
6131.65,"the dosages that are appropriate vary, "
6134.3,according to severity of the condition 
6137.34,for a given person and the age of the person. 
6140.89,This is a complicated landscape for each individual. 
6144.24,They have to figure out the pharmacology 
6145.76,that's best for them. 
6146.99,Some individuals are even layering long 
6150.34,"or time to release Ritalin with Adderall in smaller doses, "
6155.16,it can get quite complex or it can be quite straightforward 
6157.81,if you are really interested in these drugs 
6160.22,and how they work 
6161.26,and you'd like to get a glance at a table of all the results 
6166.5,"from all the studies of which there are now hundreds, "
6169.86,there's an excellent review about these drugs and their use 
6174.06,and their comparison to similarly structured drugs 
6177.27,"in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine, "
6181.53,meaning Street Amphetamine 
6183.03,to really illustrate the similarities 
6185.17,of action and some of the problems associated 
6188.56,with long-term use. 
6190.27,I don't expect you to read this article in full 
6191.87,"I'm here so that you don't have to go read these articles, "
6194.36,"but in case you want a ton of information, "
6197.1,"the paper is Esposito et al Frontiers and bio-sciences, "
6200.74,"it's an excellent, excellent "
6202.81,review of the entire literature. 
6204.68,It is quite long. 
6206.74,"I can put a link to that study in our caption, "
6209.86,and it essentially describes all the studies 
6213.11,"that have been done, peer reviewed and published, "
6215.97,and it refers to these drugs in an interesting way. 
6219.14,It doesn't just refer these drugs as for treatment of ADHD. 
6222.04,It actually refers to them using language that ordinarily 
6225.07,"I'm not very fond of, but I'll agree to here, "
6228.16,which is so-called smart drugs or nootropics. 
6232.74,"It also covers caffeine, which again as I mentioned earlier, "
6236.88,increases dopamine norepinephrine 
6239.37,"and to some extent serotonin, "
6241.89,but what I like about this review so much is that 
6245.1,"in putting, these drugs of abuse, "
6247.04,"methamphetamine, and cocaine, right alongside these drugs, "
6249.61,"like Ritalin and Adderall and also caffeine, "
6252.37,we start to realize that the distinction between 
6255.13,drugs of abuse 
6255.963,and the distinction between drugs of treatment 
6258.02,is actually a very fine and sometimes even a blurry line 
6261.75,and in thinking about whether or not one wants to use 
6265.44,"these prescription, I want to emphasize prescription, "
6267.7,"not drugs of abuse, "
6268.533,but prescription drugs 
6269.51,for treatment of one's own attentional capacity. 
6273.23,I think it is important to understand 
6275.29,the extent to which they all carry 
6277.14,more or less the same side effects. 
6278.62,The one exception being caffeine caffeine side effects 
6281.75,"can be anxiety if you ingest too much of it, insomnia, "
6284.7,"if you drink it too late in the day, "
6286.34,but typically it will not cause the major side effects 
6289.44,"of the other drugs, "
6290.92,such as high propensity for addiction and abuse. 
6295.595,Amphetamines of any kind as well as cocaine 
6298.55,can cause sexual side effects 
6300.68,because they're vasoconstrictors. 
6302.604,"So, men have trouble achieving erection, "
6306.53,"there can often be the intense desire or libido for sex, "
6311.97,but an inability to actually perform. 
6314.37,So that's an issue with any kind of stimulant. 
6316.99,So these drugs are not without their consequences. 
6319.29,"In addition, and here I'd lump caffeine back into the mix. "
6324.03,"In addition, they almost all carry cardiac effects, right? "
6327.77,"They increase heart rate, "
6328.88,but they also have effects on constriction of blood vessels 
6332.83,and arteries and veins and so forth in ways 
6334.95,that can create cardiovascular problems. 
6337.57,"Now, caffeine is a bit of a complicated one. "
6340.54,"I talked about this on a podcast long ago, "
6342.65,but I'll just remind you that it turns out 
6344.94,"that if you are caffeine adapted, in other words, "
6347.18,if you are used to drinking caffeine 
6349.3,"then the ingestion of caffeine, "
6351.28,most often will cause vasodilation who actually allow more 
6354.33,blood flow through. 
6355.57,"However, if you are not caffeine adapted, "
6357.73,it will cause vasoconstriction 
6359.619,due to an increased stress response. 
6362.16,"So if you're familiar with caffeine, "
6364.22,caffeine can actually have a little bit more 
6366.25,of a relaxation response 
6368.09,"although if you drink enough of it, "
6368.923,it will make you amped up. 
6371.0,"These other drugs, almost always lead to vasoconstriction, "
6375.05,"increased heart rate dilation of the pupils, less blinking, "
6378.22,"heightened levels of attention, "
6379.89,which looks very much like stress 
6382.05,and at its extremes looks very much 
6383.99,"like the effects of street drugs, "
6385.23,like cocaine and amphetamine. 
6387.29,Because of the large amounts of 
6388.39,dopamine that released in the brain. 
6390.62,People tend to crave that state over and over 
6393.35,and yet with each subsequent use 
6396.26,are able to get less and less 
6398.01,of that euphoric feeling 
6399.41,"or that really, really focused feeling. "
6401.33,So one thing that's being explored quite extensively now 
6403.56,in the treatment of ADHD are drug schedules. 
6407.76,Whether or not people should take Adderall every day 
6411.72,"or every other day, "
6412.8,whether or not they should take it 
6413.83,"only every once in a while, "
6415.16,whether or not young children can take it just a few times 
6417.76,and engage in behavioral training of the sort 
6420.44,"that I talked about before, where they're doing, "
6422.99,maybe it's a 
17,"minute meditation type exercise, "
6425.99,but more likely it would be the movement 
6428.13,"followed by the visual focusing, "
6430.43,cause that's only done for 
20,or 
30,or 
60,seconds. 
6433.04,Why would you do that? 
6433.873,"Well in a chemically enhanced state, "
6436.49,your brain is more plastic. 
6437.85,The circuits are able to modify and learn better. 
6442.574,That's the optimal time to engage in focus 
6445.84,in a very deliberate way. 
6447.37,So just taking a drug and expecting 
6449.33,focus to just work at any point 
6451.19,"and being able to turn focus on and off at will, "
6455.09,"that's an unrealistic expectation, right? "
6458.01,"More likely the best use of things like Adderall, Modafinil, "
6464.02,armodafinil and Ritalin is going to be 
6467.33,to combine those treatments with behavioral exercises 
6471.5,that actively engage the very circuits 
6473.36,that you're trying to train up and enhance 
6475.37,and then perhaps I want to highlight perhaps 
6478.01,tapering off those drugs 
6479.4,so that then one can use those circuits 
6481.57,without any need for chemical intervention. 
6484.47,"So despite any controversy that might be out there, "
6487.15,I think it's fair to say that 
6489.07,the consumption of omega-
3,fatty acids 
6492.26,can positively modulate 
6494.22,the systems for attention and focus. 
6496.65,"So then the question becomes how much EPA, "
6500.53,"how much DHA does that differ for, "
6503.29,"what's helpful for depression, et cetera "
6505.81,and actually it does differ 
6507.9,in reviewing the studies for this 
6509.32,it appears that a threshold level of 
300,milligrams of DHA 
6514.29,turns out to be an important inflection point. 
6517.2,So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-
3s,
6521.098,will have DHA and EPA 
6523.95,and typically it's the EPA 
6525.86,"that's harder to get at sufficient levels, "
6528.17,meaning you have to take quite a lot of fish oil 
6530.15,in order to get above that 
1000,milligram 
6532.38,or 
2000,milligram threshold to improve mood 
6535.73,and other functions. 
6536.68,"But for sake of attention, "
6539.28,there are 
10,studies that have explored this in detail 
6542.4,"and while the EPA component is important, "
6545.44,the most convincing studies point to the fact that getting 
6548.93,above 
300,milligrams per day of DHA is really where you 
6552.493,start to see the attentional effects. 
6554.29,"Now, fortunately, if you're getting sufficient EPA "
6556.5,"for sake of mood and other biological functions, "
6560.43,"almost without question, "
6562.61,you're getting 
300,milligrams or more of DHA. 
6565.24,So that usually checks that box just fine. 
6567.84,What's interesting is that there's another compound 
6570.08,phosphatidylserine that has been explored for its capacity 
6575.12,to improve the symptoms of ADHD. 
6577.68,"Again, I don't think this is any direct way, "
6579.74,"but rather in a modulatory way, "
6581.88,but it appears that phosphatidylserine 
6584.76,taken for two months for 
200,"milligrams per day, "
6589.69,was able to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children. 
6592.98,"It has not been looked at in adults yet as, "
6595.43,"at least as far as I know, "
6597.27,but that this effect was greatly enhanced 
6600.61,by the consumption of omega-
3,fatty acids. 
6603.57,So now we're starting to see synergistic effects 
6605.71,of omega-
3,fatty acids and phosphatidylserine 
6608.93,again that was 
200,milligrams per day. 
6611.21,This is something that sold 
6612.28,"over the counter in capsule form, at least in the U.S. "
6615.25,"there were two studies, "
6616.49,both were double-blind studies. 
6618.31,I carried out for anywhere from one to six months on both 
6621.87,"boys and girls and it really was boys and girls, "
6623.78,not men and women. 
6624.79,This was kids age one to six or seven to 
"12,",
6628.86,and it was a fairly large number of subjects. 
6632.16,So 
147,subjects in one case in 
36,"in the other, "
6635.57,the takeaway is that getting sufficient levels of EPA 
6639.28,and particularly there's 
300,"milligram threshold of DHA, "
6642.81,"plus, if you are interested in it and it's right for you, "
6646.76,
200,milligrams of phosphatidylserine 
6648.97,can be an important augment 
6650.44,for improving the symptoms of ADHD. 
6653.51,You'll also find literature out there 
6655.4,"and many claims about so-called Ginkgo Biloba, "
6659.29,which has been shown to have minor effects 
6661.81,"in improving the symptoms of ADHD, "
6664.08,not nearly as effective as Ritalin and Adderall. 
6668.881,Ginkgo Biloba is not appropriate for many people. 
6672.49,"I am one such person, I don't have ADHD, "
6675.49,"but when I'd taken Gingko, even at very low doses, "
6679.33,I get absolutely splitting headaches. 
6681.69,"Some people do not experience those headaches, "
6683.44,but it's known to have very potent vasoconstrictive 
6685.793,and vasodilating properties that vary depending on 
6689.88,when you took the compound. 
6692.0,"So for those of you that are exploring Ginkgo Biloba, "
6695.77,and you will see a lot of claims about Ginkgo Biloba 
6698.06,for attention in ADHD definitely take the vasodilation 
6701.784,vasoconstriction headache issue into consideration. 
6706.03,So I'd like to talk about the drug Modafinil 
6708.46,and the closely related drug armodafinil 
6710.95,that's AR Modafinil. 
6713.15,Because Modafinil and armodafinil 
6715.53,"are gaining popularity out there, "
6717.37,"both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy, "
6720.3,but also for communities of people 
6723.81,that are trying to stay awake long periods of time. 
6725.95,"So it's actively used in the military by first responders, "
6730.03,it's gaining popularity on college campuses 
6733.14,and people are using it more and more as an alternative 
6735.48,to Adderall and Ritalin and excessive amounts of coffee. 
6740.65,"It does increase focus and to a dramatic extent, "
6744.52,"Modafinil typically was very expensive, "
6748.24,"I don't know if it's still this expensive, "
6750.12,"but when one has a prescription for it, "
6752.59,it could still cost as much as eight or $
900,
6755.62,even $
1000,a month. 
6757.894,"Armodafinil is a far less expensive version, "
6761.98,that's chemically slightly different than Modafinil. 
6764.94,Regardless of price 
6765.88,people are taking Modafinil and armodafinil. 
6768.635,"Want to emphasize that unlike Ritalin and Adderall, "
6772.55,Modafinil and armodafinil are weak dopamine 
6776.33,"re-uptake inhibitors, "
6777.78,and that's how they lead to increases in dopamine. 
6780.15,"So, whereas Ritalin and Adderall, amphetamine, "
6782.61,and cocaine lead to big increases in dopamine 
6785.34,also through re-uptake mechanisms and so forth 
6787.91,Modafinil is a weaker dopamine re-uptake stimulator 
6792.83,and so what that means is that it leaves 
6795.15,"more dopamine around to be active at the synopsis, "
6797.75,"the gaps between neurons, "
6799.91,"however, it also activates other systems. "
6802.09,"It acts on the orexin system, "
6804.28,which is actually a peptide that we talked about 
6806.43,"in the episode on hunger, "
6808.45,"because it regulates hunger and appetite, "
6811.13,and it regulates sleepiness and feelings of sleepiness. 
6814.34,"In fact, the, excuse me, orexin "
6816.14,"also called hypocretin system, "
6817.74,the orexin hypocretin system 
6819.36,is what's disrupted in narcolepsy. 
6822.06,"That was the important discovery of my colleagues, "
6824.43,Emmanuel Mignot and Seiji Nishino 
6826.63,"at Stanford some years ago, "
6828.37,they identified the biological basis of narcolepsy 
6830.99,and it's a disruption in the so orexin hypocretin system 
6834.84,and Modafinil is one of the 
6836.35,primary treatments for narcolepsy. 
6838.14,It also has these other effects on the dopamine system 
6841.64,"and on the norepinephrine system, "
6843.93,even though it doesn't lead to quite as intense levels 
6848.5,"of dopamine and arousal and focus, "
6851.38,it does have the property of raising levels of attention 
6854.027,"and focus, and that's why people are using it. "
6856.19,So it's a somewhat milder form of Adderall. 
6859.697,Armodafinil for some people works as well as Modafinil 
6862.796,"and as I mentioned before, "
6863.88,it's much lower cost for other people it doesn't. 
6866.26,"I have an experience, "
6867.92,meaning I do have an experience 
6870.32,that I'll share with you with armodafinil. 
6872.23,"A few years ago, "
6873.27,"I was suffering from jet lag, really terribly "
6876.46,and I was traveling overseas. 
6878.32,"I went to a meeting to give a talk, "
6880.83,I took half of the prescribed dose of armodafinil. 
6885.519,It was prescribed to me. 
6887.72,I took that half dose and I gave my lecture 
6891.25,and then I stayed around to answer questions 
6893.17,"and then four hours later, "
6896.09,"a friend of mine came up to me and said, "
6898.01,"you've been talking for four and a half hours, "
6901.1,and they're only a few people still here. 
6903.64,"Luckily there were still a few people be a lot weirder, "
6905.67,"if the room was completely empty, "
6907.7,'cause it wasn't being recorded. 
6909.46,So I have firsthand knowledge 
6910.99,of the sorts of cognitive effects that it can create. 
6914.02,I personally would not want to be in that state 
6916.49,for sake of studying or learning 
6918.16,"or for doing this podcast, for instance "
6921.31,"and I can honestly say that today, "
6923.24,all I've adjusted is some coffee 
6925.58,and some Yerba latte tea and some water. 
6927.532,I'm not on any of the compounds that I've described during 
6930.94,the course of today's episode. 
6932.82,You might ask why I took half the recommended dose 
6936.1,of armodafinil and the reason is that I'm somebody who's 
6940.56,"fairly hypersensitive to medication of any kind, "
6944.046,"what you find if you look in the literature, "
6946.84,is that about 
5%,of people 
6948.62,are hyper hyper sensitive to medication. 
6950.86,They require far lower doses of any medication 
6953.93,than other people in order to experience the same effects. 
6956.59,"I'm somebody that I think has, "
6957.68,"or modest a hyper if that sort of oxymoronic statement, "
6962.15,but a modest hypersensitivity to medication. 
6965.39,"So I've almost always been able to get by, "
6967.21,on taking less of whatever was prescribed for me 
6970.9,and feel just fine 
6971.92,"or in this case to feel like it was still too much, "
6973.97,it turned out that the right dose of armodafinil for me 
6977.18,was zero milligrams. 
6979.13,Now you may notice that 
6980.0,I haven't talked much about acetylcholine. 
6982.8,Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter 
6984.96,"that at the neuron to muscle connections, "
6987.01,the so called neuromuscular junctions 
6988.88,is involved in generating muscular contractions 
6990.88,of all kinds for all movements. 
6994.12,Acetylcholine is also released from two sites in the brain. 
6997.19,"So a little bit of nomenclature here again, "
6998.98,"feel free to ignore the nomenclature, "
7001.08,but there is a collection of neurons in your brain stem 
7003.72,"that send projections forward, "
7005.1,kind of like a sprinkler system 
7006.6,that's very diffuse to release acetylcholine 
7010.06,and those neurons reside in an area or a structure 
7013.68,"that's called the pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN "
7017.26,and then there's a separate collection of neurons 
7019.38,in the basal forebrain called 
7022.068,unimaginatively nucleus basalis the nucleus at the base 
7025.75,"and they also hose the brain with acetylcholine, "
7029.3,but in a much more specific way. 
7031.85,So one is sort of like a sprinkler system 
7033.497,and the other one is more like a fire hose 
7035.43,to a particular location 
7036.51,"and those two sources of acetylcholine, "
7039.96,"collaborate to activate particular locations in the brain, "
7043.81,and really bring about a tremendous degree of focus 
7046.54,to whatever is happening at those particular synapses. 
7049.74,So it could be a focus on visual information 
7052.02,"or auditory information, "
7053.23,"if you're listening closely to what I'm saying right now, "
7055.677,and you just heard closely 
7057.32,"step out from the rest of my sentence, "
7059.42,no doubt there was acetylcholine 
7061.31,released at the sites in your brain 
7063.22,where the neurons that represent your recognition 
7066.59,"of the word closely occurred, okay? "
7069.29,So now you have an example and you have an understanding 
7071.37,and hopefully a picture in your mind 
7072.53,"of how all this is working, "
7074.261,not surprisingly then drugs that increase cholinergic 
7078.27,or acetycholine transmission 
7079.845,will increase focus and cognition. 
7083.003,"One such compound is so-called alpha GPC, "
7086.42,which is a form of choline and increases acetycholine 
7089.97,transmission dosages as high as 
1200,"milligrams per day, "
7094.66,"which has a very high dosage spread out, "
7096.53,typically it's 
300,or 
400,milligrams spread out 
7099.61,throughout the day have been shown to offset 
7103.17,"some of the effects of age-related cognitive decline, "
7106.26,improved cognitive functioning 
7107.49,people that don't have age-related cognitive decline 
7109.6,that's a very high dose. 
7110.98,Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study 
7114.75,"or to enhance learning of any kind, "
7116.93,they will take somewhere between 
300,and 
600,milligrams 
7120.0,that's more typical. 
7121.69,"Again, you have to check with your doctor, "
7123.67,you have to decide if the safety margins 
7125.42,are appropriate for you 
7127.12,"obviously you'll want to check that out, "
7129.57,but alpha-GPC is effective in creating 
7132.45,"more focused by way of this cholinergic system, "
7134.92,It stimulates acetylcholine release 
7136.79,"from both of those locations, "
7138.94,the PPN in the back of the brain and nucleus basalis 
7141.91,in the front of the brain. 
7144.3,There are two other over the counter compounds 
7147.019,that are in active use out there for treatment of ADHD 
7151.56,and in use for simply trying to improve focus 
7155.541,and the first one is L-Tyrosine 
7157.66,it's an amino acid that acts as a precursor 
7160.29,to the neuromodulator dopamine 
7162.37,and now knowing everything you know about 
7163.317,"dopamine, attention and the circuits involved, "
7165.82,it should come as no surprise as to why 
7167.9,people are exploring the use of L-tyrosine for that purpose. 
7171.31,L-tyrosine does lead to increases in dopamine. 
7175.71,They are fairly long lived and L-tyrosine can improve 
7180.06,"one's ability to focus, however, "
7182.87,the dosaging can be very tricky to dial in. 
7186.11,Sometimes it makes people feel too euphoric 
7188.75,or too jittery or too alert that they are then 
7191.51,unable to focus well. 
7192.957,"So the dosage ranges are huge, "
7196.32,you see evidence for 
100,milligrams 
7198.63,all the way up to 
1200,milligrams. 
7200.9,It's something that really 
7201.733,"should be approached with caution, "
7202.75,especially for people that have any kind 
7204.78,"of underlying psychiatric or mood disorder, "
7207.56,because dysregulation of the dopamine system is 
7211.43,"central to many of the mood disorders such as depression, "
7215.42,"but also especially mania bipolar disorder, "
7219.08,"schizophrenia, things of that sort. "
7221.03,So it's something that really should be approached 
7222.68,"with caution, nonetheless, in exploring what's out there "
7225.97,and even some studies online 
7228.918,"that were done in either animal studies or human studies, "
7232.55,it's clear that L-tyrosine is being explored for that 
7235.91,"purpose as is PEA and Phenethylamine, "
7239.41,"which is a essentially PEA, but some related compounds. "
7243.91,So there's a whole class of dopaminergic 
7246.72,or dopamine stimulating supplements 
7248.8,that people are using to try 
7249.74,"and get their dopamine levels up and again, "
7252.06,it's kind of a fine line between too little enough 
7256.51,and too much. 
7257.42,If you want to get the literature on 
7259.61,"those two compounds there, I will refer you to "
7262.55,this great website at examine.com just as it sounds 
7267.11,"and you can put in L-tyrosine or PEA, "
7269.8,and you can get the details on that. 
7271.05,But I highly recommend also going to their section on ADHD 
7274.68,to see how those particular comment OENs relate specifically 
7277.8,to ADHD and cognitive focus. 
7280.95,And last but not least 
7282.58,"in terms of these different compounds, "
7284.29,I do want to mention the Racetams. 
7287.87,These are somewhat esoteric 
7290.4,"and probably most of you haven't heard about them, "
7292.64,but some of you probably know a lot about them 
7295.37,and they are becoming more popular. 
7296.78,They go by names like New pepped and things of that sort. 
7300.65,The Racetams. are illegal in certain countries. 
7303.8,"They are gray market in other countries, "
7305.7,"and they are sold over the counter in this country, "
7308.93,in the U.S. so they have different margins for safety 
7314.32,"you definitely need to consult your doctor, "
7316.55,"especially if you have ADHD, "
7318.66,"but new pepped has been shown when taken, "
7322.23,at 
10,"milligrams, twice daily can be more effective "
7326.01,than some of the other Racetams. 
7327.83,"What is Noopept? Noopept taps into the cholinergic system, "
7331.01,"the acetylcholine system in ways, very similar to alpha-GPC, "
7334.76,but seems to have a slightly higher affinity for some of the 
7338.35,receptors involved and can lead to those heightened states 
7342.0,of cognitive capacity 
7343.1,"and there are these studies one in particular, "
7346.069,"comparative studies of new pepped, "
7348.04,Racetams in the treatment of patients 
7349.41,with mild cognitive disorders 
7351.315,and brain diseases of vascular and traumatic origin. 
7354.34,That's a mouthful. 
7355.19,What this study basically points to 
7357.55,is the fact that people who are experiencing some degree 
7360.82,of inability to focus due to prior concussion 
7364.15,"or some vascular event, a stroke or a schemey of any kind, "
7367.84,"because neurons need blood, "
7369.1,"when the blood supply is cut off to neurons, "
7370.95,or when there's a bleed in the brain. 
7372.8,"Subsequent to that, often "
7374.81,there are challenges in maintaining focus. 
7376.76,"This is very common for people who have done sports, "
7379.12,where there's a lot of running into each other 
7380.65,"with your head like rugby football, hockey, and so forth, "
7384.36,but also people who have experienced head blows 
7386.15,or often overlooked is the fact that 
7388.46,"most traumatic head injury is not actually from sports, "
7391.41,even football it's from things like construction work 
7394.13,from high-impact work of that kind. 
7396.64,So there does seem to be some efficacy 
7398.56,of new Pepped and Racetams. and things like it. 
7402.62,It's an emerging area and as I mentioned in the U.S. 
7405.53,these things are sold over the counter. 
7407.37,"Again, you have to figure out if it's right for you, "
7409.66,"but they are beginning to show some promise, "
7412.9,and I'm intrigued by them because of the way 
7415.67,"that they tap into the cholinergic system, "
7417.7,"which is both directly involved in focus, "
7420.397,"and the ability to focus, "
7422.43,but is also important for things related 
7425.79,to age-related cognitive decline. 
7427.67,So a decline in cholinergic transmission or acetylcholine 
7431.32,as we call it in the brain is one of the things 
7434.32,associated with cognitive decline 
7435.297,and it does seem that increasing cholinergic transmission 
7438.4,can offset some of that cognitive decline 
7440.42,and perhaps even more so in conditions 
7443.28,such as vascular damage or concussion to the brain. 
7446.31,If you're interested in atypical treatments for ADHD 
7450.86,"compounds or improve focus and related themes, "
7453.32,"and you like reading about this stuff, "
7454.96,there's an excellent review article 
7456.52,that I can refer you to it's 
7458.22,"by Ahn et al, AHN it was published in "
2016,
7462.6,"so it's a little bit behind the times, "
7465.647,"although it's surprisingly comprehensive given that, "
7467.71,"which lines up all the various drugs that I've discussed, "
7472.55,"Racetams., and Adderall and Ritalin, "
7474.59,and various forms of dopaminergic agents 
7478.12,and cholinergic agents spells out whether or not 
7480.64,"they are sold over the counter by prescription, "
7483.36,"and really lines them up in all their effects, "
7485.23,"their drawbacks, et cetera. "
7488.16,I'll refer you to that study. 
7489.4,It's available in its full length form online for free 
7492.414,"it's Hen et al the journal is neuro plasticity, "
7496.64,"neural plasticity, "
2016,
7498.95,"should be very easy to find if you put those keywords in, "
7501.43,"and while it is a review, "
7502.68,it is a very comprehensive review 
7504.41,"and if you're really into this stuff, "
7506.12,and you also want to learn a thing or two about 
7508.65,"how these things interact with neurofeedback, et cetera, "
7511.48,there's some information in there as well. 
7513.47,"I know I've already covered a lot of information, "
7515.57,but there is one more category of technology 
7518.52,for the treatment of ADHD and for enhancement of focus 
7522.56,in anyone that I would like to emphasize 
7526.03,and that's transcranial magnetic stimulation. 
7528.92,Transcranial magnetic stimulation also called TMS 
7531.98,is achieving increasing popularity nowadays 
7534.62,for the treatment of all sorts of neurologic conditions 
7538.41,and psychiatric conditions. 
7540.2,"It is a non-invasive tool, "
7541.85,it involves taking a coil it's a device with a coil 
7545.52,"that's placed over particular locations in the brain, "
7548.97,and then sends magnetic stimulation into the brain 
7553.22,and it can actually pass through the skull 
7554.57,without having to drill through the skull 
7556.55,and nowadays can be used to both 
7559.19,lower the amount of activity 
7560.87,or increase the amount of activity 
7562.55,in specific brain areas. 
7564.74,"It's spatial, precision is not remarkable. "
7569.84,"That doesn't mean it's not of use, "
7571.2,"but it is not a super fine green tool, okay? "
7576.24,"It's not a canon, but it's also not a needle. "
7579.46,It is somewhere in between. 
7581.2,It can direct the activity of particular brain regions 
7583.85,"at particular depths and as I mentioned, "
7586.45,it can increase or decrease that activity. 
7588.45,"So for instance, "
7589.49,"I've had a TMS coil placed on my head, "
7591.16,"not for therapeutic purposes, even it was, "
7593.93,"I wouldn't tell you, but rather just for, "
7596.64,"well, I'm a neuroscientist "
7597.99,"and I worked in a lab with one for entertainment, "
7600.24,"exploratory purposes, please don't do this at home. "
7604.12,"It was placed over my motor cortex, "
7606.75,which generates voluntary action 
7609.26,and it was a coil that at that time 
7612.23,could only inhibit neurons 
7614.11,and so what I was doing as I was moving objects 
7616.67,"around on a table, just like I am now, "
7618.47,"it was actually a pencil, not a pen "
7620.33,and I was tapping the pencil 
7621.98,"and then the TMS coil was turned on and for the life of me, "
7625.4,"I could not move that pencil, okay? "
7628.57,Because it was inhibiting my upper motor neurons 
7631.51,in the portion of my cortex 
7632.97,that controls voluntary activity. 
7635.59,"As soon as the coil was turned off, "
7636.96,"I could return to tapping the pencil again, "
7639.94,nowadays it's possible to stimulate motor cortex 
7643.18,or any area of the brain with some degree of precision 
7646.18,that could create the impulse to move 
7649.55,without actually making the decision to move. 
7651.69,So you can literally engage certain neural circuits 
7654.81,and therefore behaviors and certain thought 
7656.86,and emotional patterns 
7658.0,by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation. 
7660.436,"This has far reaching and vast implications, "
7663.85,as you can probably imagine 
7667.01,"in discussing ADHD with a colleague that uses TMS, "
7670.75,what they are doing is they are taking the TMS coil 
7675.4,"to children and adults that have ADHD, "
7679.27,and they're using it to stimulate the portions 
7681.95,of the prefrontal cortex that we talked about earlier 
7684.75,that engage task directed focused states. 
7688.62,So rather than using a drug 
7689.96,"that generally increases dopamine, "
7691.247,and some of the other chemicals involved 
7693.12,there you using directed TMS stimulation of the circuits 
7697.31,"and fortunately, I was quite relieved to hear this, "
7700.49,they are combining that with a focused learning task. 
7704.06,So they're literally teaching the brain to learn 
7705.94,"in a noninvasive way, no drug at all "
7708.81,and right now there are experiments clinical trials 
7711.59,"going on, comparing TMS of this sort "
7714.11,to the drug treatments of the sort that we described earlier 
7717.57,that engaged these circuits 
7718.69,through pharmacologic mechanisms. 
7720.16,"So very exciting times for TMS, "
7722.719,very exciting times for pharmacology related to ADHD 
7728.06,and for enhancing focus in general 
7729.75,"and when I say very exciting times, "
7731.58,"I mean, no drug is perfect, "
7733.46,but the constellation of drugs that's out there 
7737.25,"is getting much larger, "
7738.92,but because they tap into different aspects 
7741.32,"of their circuitry, "
7742.153,I do think that we are well on our way 
7744.06,"to identifying the ideal combinations of drug treatments, "
7746.87,"technological treatments, "
7748.01,and behavioral paradigms for increasing focus in both 
7751.36,children and adults with ADHD. 
7754.13,"And as a final final point, "
7756.65,I also want to mention something about technologies 
7758.98,"that are making it harder for all of us to focus, "
7762.14,regardless of whether or not 
7763.24,we have pre-existing ADHD or not. 
7765.36,You can probably guess where this is going. 
7768.8,Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone. 
7771.18,I'm sure there are a few individuals out there 
7773.25,that don't have a smartphone. 
7775.54,"Nonetheless, most people have them. "
7777.16,"Most kids want one, as soon as they can get them "
7780.09,"and they are small, they grab our attention entirely. "
7785.91,"But within that small box of attention, "
7788.56,there are millions of attentional windows 
7791.86,"scrolling by, right? "
7793.16,So just because it's one device that we look at 
7795.17,"does not mean that we are focused, "
7796.8,"we are focused on our phone, "
7798.63,"but because of the way, "
7800.0,"in which context switches up so fast within the phone, "
7803.4,it's thought that the brain is struggling now 
7806.43,"to leave that rapid turnover of context, right? "
7809.54,"Many, many shows, many, many Instagram pages, "
7812.19,"many, many Twitter feeds many, many websites. "
7814.23,"Basically the whole world, "
7816.5,at least in virtual format is available 
7818.5,within that small box. 
7820.16,Unlike any other technology 
7821.59,"humans have ever dealt with before, "
7823.12,even though there are trillions 
7825.37,infinite number of bits of information 
7827.15,"in the actual physical world, "
7829.28,"your attentional window, "
7830.53,that aperture of constriction 
7832.74,and dilating that visual window 
7834.91,is the way in which you cope with all that 
7836.62,overwhelming information typically. 
7839.14,"Well within the phone, "
7840.64,your visual aperture is set to a given width 
7844.01,"it's about this big, "
7845.04,"typically the phone seem to be getting bigger, "
7846.74,"but nonetheless, it's about that big "
7848.97,"and within there, "
7851.13,your attentional window is grabbing it near infinite 
7854.6,"number of bits of information, colors, movies. "
7857.3,If a picture is worth 
1000,"words, "
7859.12,"a movie is worth a billion pictures, "
7861.45,the brain loves visual motion 
7863.54,"and so the question is, "
7867.04,does that sort of interaction on a regular basis 
7869.38,lead to deficits in the types of attention 
7872.01,that we need in order to perform well 
7873.61,"in work, in school, relationships, et cetera "
7875.69,"and the short answer is yes, it does appear so "
7879.2,we are inducing a sort of ADHD 
7882.17,and while the studies on this are ongoing because prominent 
7885.12,use of smartphones really took off right around 
2010,
7887.93,and we're only in 
2021,"longstanding studies take time, "
7893.56,which is essentially to say the same thing as long standing. 
7896.91,There are some studies and one in particular 
7899.1,that I'd like to highlight 
7899.933,one was actually carried out pretty early in 
2014.,
7902.9,This is a study that explored smartphone use 
7906.08,"at the time they called it mobile phone use, "
7907.97,"but smartphone use and inattention, "
7910.67,difficulties in attending in 
"7,",
102,adolescents 
7916.94,"that's a huge study, "
7918.02,a population based cross-sectional study 
7921.3,and you will be probably surprised and somewhat dismayed 
7926.56,to hear that in order to avoid this decrease 
7930.07,"in attentional capacity, "
7932.42,adolescents needed to use their smartphone 
7936.44,for less than 
60,"minutes per day, "
7939.29,in order to stay focused and centered on their other tasks. 
7943.01,Otherwise they started to really run 
7944.53,into significant issues. 
7946.41,So 
60,"minutes is not much, "
7948.61,I've a feeling that most young people 
7950.997,are using their phone more than 
60,"minutes per day, "
7953.69,I know I am. 
7955.17,"I think for adults, "
7956.02,"the number's probably higher meaning if you're an adult, "
7960.66,I'm going to just extrapolate from what I read in this study. 
7963.77,It seems that probably two hours a day on the phone 
7967.11,would be the upper limit beyond which 
7969.76,you would probably experience 
7971.44,pretty severe attentional deficits. 
7974.96,"I'm a big fan of Cal Newport who wrote the book ""Deep work."" "
7977.91,"He's also written an excellent book, "
7979.267,"""A world without Email."" "
7980.39,"I've never met him, but I'm a huge admirer of his work "
7982.46,and I will paraphrase something that he said 
7985.16,"far more eloquently than I ever could, "
7987.42,which is that the brain does not do well with constant 
7992.2,"context switching, meaning it can do it, "
7995.61,but it diminishes our capacity to do meaningful work 
7998.62,of any other kind. 
8000.27,"And so Cal, as I understand is very "
8004.15,he's our computer science professor 
8005.55,"at Georgetown, by the way, "
8006.8,is very structured and very disciplined 
8009.89,in his avoidance of cell phone use. 
8013.27,I think we're all striving to do that. 
8014.85,"I'm not here to tell you what to do, "
8016.1,"but I think whether or not you have ADHD or not, "
8019.52,if you're an adolescent limiting your smartphone use 
8022.93,to 
60,minutes per day or less 
8025.36,and if you are an adult to two hours per day or less 
8029.92,"is going to be among the very best ways to maintain, "
8034.14,just to maintain your ability to focus 
8036.64,"at whatever level you can now and as I always say, "
8041.36,most of the things that we get recognized 
8043.04,"for in life success in life, in every endeavor, "
8045.9,"whether or not it's school relationships, sport, "
8048.905,creative works of any kind are always proportional 
8052.81,to the amount of focus that we can bring that activity. 
8056.07,"It is important to rest of course, to get proper sleep. "
8058.3,But I stand behind that statement 
8060.4,and I leave you with that study about attention 
8063.39,and cell phones and how cell phones are indeed eroding 
8066.67,our attentional capacities. 
8068.61,So I realized I covered a lot of information about ADHD 
8071.68,and the biology of focus and how to get better at focusing. 
8075.69,We talked about the behavioral 
8077.59,and psychological phenotypes of ADHD. 
8080.25,We talked about the underlying neural circuitry. 
8083.64,We also talked about the neurochemistry 
8085.9,and we talked about the various prescription 
8087.89,drug treatments that are aimed at that neurochemistry 
8091.14,and aimed at increasing focus in children 
8093.6,and adults with ADHD. 
8095.52,"We also talked about over the counter compounds, "
8098.29,the role of particular types of diets and elimination diets 
8101.69,and we talked about interactions between these various 
8104.43,features in dictating outcomes for ADHD 
8108.11,"and enhancing focus in general, "
8110.1,we also talked a little bit about emerging neurotechnologies 
8113.42,and how certain technologies like the smartphone 
8115.9,are no doubt hindering our ability to focus 
8118.59,and put us at greater risk of developing ADHD at all ages. 
8123.54,I do acknowledge the irony and somewhat the contradiction 
8127.02,of doing a two hour plus episode on ADHD 
8130.64,"If indeed, people who are watching this "
8132.88,"have challenges with attention, "
8134.47,"I want to emphasize that this podcast, "

8155.41,I hope you've also learned a lot 
8157.03,about your own capacity to focus 
8158.99,and things that you can do to enhance your focus. 
8160.85,We even talked about a tool that takes just 
8162.52,one 
17,minute session to enhance your ability to focus 
8166.031,"thereafter, presumably forever. "

8210.47,for research on neurobiology in my laboratory. 
8213.579,"In addition, we have a Patreon "
8215.3,it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman. 
8218.51,There you can support the podcast

8221.88,During today's episode we talked a lot about 
8223.79,supplement based compounds. 
8225.95,If you're interested in supplements 
8227.22,"and you want to see the supplements that I personally take, "
8229.46,you can go to Thorn that's T-H-O-R-N-E slash the letter U 
8234.43,slash Huberman and you can see everything that I take 
8237.88,and you can get 
20%,off any of those supplements 
8240.59,"or if you navigate into the Thorn site through that portal, "
8243.85,you can get 
20%,"off any of the supplements that Thorn makes, "
8247.36,"supplements aren't for everybody, "
8248.75,you by no means have to take supplements. 
8250.7,"But if you are going to take supplements, "
8252.06,it's important that you take supplements 
8253.29,from a source that's reputable 
8255.2,and which the ingredients are very high quality 
8258.18,and in which the amount of the ingredients 
8260.46,that listed on the bottle 
8261.76,actually matches what's in the bottle. 
8263.38,That's why we partnered with Thorn 
8264.97,because they have the highest levels of stringency 
8266.9,in terms of quality and specificity of the ingredients. 
8270.0,"And finally, "
8270.833,"I want to thank you for your time and your attention, "
8273.28,and as always thank you for your interest in science.
