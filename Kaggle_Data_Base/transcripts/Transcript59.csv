0.37,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
1.88,where we discuss science
3.46,and science-based tools for everyday life.
6.258,[upbeat music]
9.47,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
10.42,and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology,and Ophthalmology
12.97,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.84,"Today, we're talking all about goals"
16.91,and the science of goal setting
and,achieving your goals.
20.81,There's a tremendous amount of information
22.59,"on the internet and in books and so forth,"
24.94,about how to set goals
26.16,and assess your progress towards goals
28.44,and update your goals and so forth.
31.24,"In fact, there are so"
many,"programs out there,"
33.78,that includes so many different acronyms
35.77,that it can be a little bit overwhelming.
37.72,"Today's conversation about goals,"
39.61,is going to be quite a bit different.
41.29,"Indeed, we are going to"
talk,about setting goals.
43.73,We are also going to talk
about,how to assess progress
46.86,towards goals.
47.693,And we are going to talk
about,goal execution.
51.12,"However, we're going to do all of this"
53.41,"in the context of neuroscience,"
55.83,because it turns out that there
are,not hundreds or dozens
60.9,or even several neural
circuits,"in your brain,"
63.42,that control goal setting and
movement,toward your goals.
66.95,There is one
68.21,and while it includes many
different,"brain areas,"
70.66,"that one circuit is the same circuit,"
72.784,that's responsible for pursuing all goals.
76.46,And it relates to some very
basic,neurochemical mechanisms
79.18,that are understood.
80.43,So while there's a wealth
of,information out there
82.33,about goals and goal setting
83.76,"and goal achievement and so forth,"
85.96,there's comparatively little information
87.88,that's been available to the public
89.55,about the neuroscience of goal
setting,and goal achievement.
92.97,So that's what we're
going,to focus on today.
95.12,I promise that we're going
to,"get into the neuroscience,"
97.96,we're going to touch on a
little,bit of the psychology
100.05,and how the neuroscience
relates,to what's known
102.13,in the psychology literature.
103.89,And we are going to
establish,"several, in fact,"
106.36,four specific protocols that
you,"can use for goal setting,"
110.15,goal assessment and goal
execution,"in an ongoing basis,"
113.71,regardless of what your
personal,goals happen to be.
116.65,Before we dive into our
conversation,about goals
118.69,"and goal setting and goal achievement,"
120.18,I'd like to highlight some
recent,"scientific findings,"
122.81,that I think are going to be interesting
124.39,and actionable for many of you out there.
127.27,"In earlier podcasts, we"
talked,"about neuro-plasticity,"
130.05,which is the brain's ability to change
131.73,in response to experience.
132.87,"In fact, neuroplasticity"
underlies,"all forms of learning,"
136.58,whether or not it's language
learning,or learning music
139.17,"or math or a physical skill,"
141.601,all forms of learning
involve,the reorganization
145.16,"of connections in the nervous system,"
146.96,the brain and spinal cord and body.
149.69,One of the key principles
of,"neuroplasticity,"
151.956,is this notion of making
errors,as a good thing
156.0,toward neuroplasticity.
157.18,"It is a little bit counterintuitive,"
159.06,but what the scientific
literature,"tells us,"
161.4,is that whenever we're trying
to,"learn something new,"
163.45,"if we make an error, we"
know,"it feels frustrating,"
166.41,"but that state of frustration,"
168.25,actually queues up particular
brain,"areas to be more alert,"
172.33,so that on subsequent
attempts,"to learn that thing,"
174.99,we have a heightened level of focus
176.227,and a higher probability
of,"learning the new skill,"
179.02,regardless of what that skill is.
180.697,And I've talked about this
before,"in various episodes,"
183.37,as encouraging people to
embrace,"errors or pursue errors,"
188.04,"not as their own end goal,"
189.73,but errors as an entry point
191.28,for making the brain more plastic.
193.06,And if you think about
it,"really makes sense,"
194.68,"why would the brain change at all,"
195.81,if it's performing everything perfectly?
198.11,"When you make errors, well"
in,the immediate seconds
201.15,"and minutes after those errors,"
202.87,you are in a better position to learn.
205.48,"A common question I get, however,"
is,what should be the rate
209.1,of errors?
209.933,"Which is really just a way of saying,"
211.15,how hard should the given task be
214.81,that you're trying to learn or perform?
217.19,And it turns out there's an answer.
218.58,There's a recent paper that was published
220.34,"in a great journal,"
Nature,Communications.
222.72,"This is a paper, our last"
"author,","Jonathan Cohen,"
225.75,"and the paper is entitled,"
227.417,"""The Eighty Five Percent"
Rule,"for optimal learning""."
231.06,"This paper, we will"
make,available by a link
233.17,"in the show note captions,"
235.01,"but basically what this paper shows,"
237.04,is that when trying to
learn,"something new,"
239.76,you want to make the difficulty
241.06,"of what you're trying to learn, such that,"
242.83,you are getting things
right,about 85% of the time.
246.02,That you're making errors
about,15% of the time.
249.0,"And the reason I like this paper,"
250.84,is it really points
specifically,to some protocols
254.04,that we can implement
254.873,"because people always say, okay,"
you,want to set a high goal.
257.74,You want to try and achieve
something,"that's really lofty,"
259.96,but you don't want to
make,the goal so lofty
261.68,that you don't make any progress at all.
263.68,"Other people say, you really want to start"
265.01,with really small goals
266.44,"and make things very, very incremental."
268.09,Only set out to do things that
you,know you can accomplish
271.11,and that will feed back on
your,self-esteem and all these
273.61,positive feedback loops.
274.76,"And then, you know, layer"
by,"layer, layer by layer,"
277.29,you'll eventually get
where,you want to go.
278.92,"Well, it turns out that neither is true"
280.44,"you need to set the level of difficulty,"
282.25,such that you're making
errors,about 15% of the time.
285.24,And I want to emphasize
about,"15% of the time,"
288.12,because there's no way to
figure,protocols for sport
292.24,"or language or math or anything else,"
293.92,where you're going to
have,exactly 15% errors.
297.03,"So, anyway, this paper, the"
85%,"rule for optimal learning,"
300.47,"again, we will supply the link,"
301.85,but it really points to the idea
302.84,"of making things pretty hard,"
305.42,but not so hard that you're
failing,every attempt
307.64,or even half of the attempts.
309.13,Failing about 15% of the time
seems,optimal for learning.
313.45,Hopefully that information
will,be useful to any of you
315.43,that are trying to learn something.
317.21,Hopefully it will also
be,useful to those of you
319.18,that are teaching kids or other adults.
322.03,"If you're teaching,"
322.863,keep in mind that you want
to,keep the students reaching
326.1,for higher and higher
levels,of proficiency
329.06,in whatever that is that you're teaching.
330.9,And that 15% of the time
they,"should be failing,"
333.85,"if it gets to 20%, that's probably okay."
335.86,"If they start failing about half the time,"
337.83,then probably what they're
trying,to learn is too difficult
340.82,for them at that point.
342.28,"Now, of course, this is going"
to,be controlled by all sorts
344.42,"of external factors,"
345.34,like whether or not they
slept,"well the night before,"
347.34,whether or not you slept
well,the night before
348.9,and you're being clear
in,your instructions
351.09,"to them, et cetera."
352.37,But I think the 15%
rule,"as we may call it,"
355.06,is a good metric to aim for
356.87,and it can serve both
students,and teachers.
359.15,"In other words, it can"
serve,both those teaching
361.21,and those that are learning.
363.14,"Before we begin, I'd like to"
emphasize,"that this podcast,"
365.54,is separate from my teaching
and,research roles at Stanford.
368.3,"It is however, part of"
my,"desire and effort,"
370.17,to bring zero cost to consumer
information,about science
372.59,and science related tools
to,the general public.
375.21,"In keeping with that theme,"
376.21,I'd like to thank the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
378.94,"Our first sponsor is LMNT,"
381.07,LMNT is an electrolyte drink
mixed,with everything you need
383.67,and nothing you don't.
384.83,"That means lots of salt,"
386.18,some other electrolytes and no sugar.
388.74,As I've mentioned before on this podcast
390.45,"and in various interviews,"
I'm,a big fan of salt.
393.66,"I sort of discovered this a few years ago,"
395.43,"when ""Science Magazine"","
396.6,one of the pre-eminent
magazines,"out there,"
398.93,"that publishes research on science,"
400.79,"but also news articles about science,"
402.51,talked about the myth of salt research.
404.93,"It turns out, that contrary"
to,"what I had believed,"
408.1,which was that salt is
going,to cause hypertension
410.75,or that salt is really bad for us.
412.35,There's an innate need
for,salt in our system
414.73,"and indeed, if you dive into"
the,"textbooks on salt balance,"
417.41,we have entire biological
systems,of our kidneys
420.08,"and fluid management, et cetera,"
422.18,that are involved in making
sure,that we get enough salt.
423.196,"In fact, neurons, nerve cells, function"
427.23,"because salt, sodium actually"
enters,those cells quickly
430.97,and that's what causes them
to,fire action potentials.
433.91,The common syllable or a
language,"of neurons, if you will,"
437.82,"when we are low in sodium,"
439.56,our neurons don't work as well.
441.24,"And a few years later,"
442.13,I had the experience of
feeling,kind of shaky
444.62,and I thought I had blood sugar issues.
446.01,I went and got my blood sugar
checked,and it was fine.
448.13,"And a physician made the recommendation,"
449.72,that I actually up my salt intake.
451.72,My intake wasn't particularly
"low,","I didn't think,"
454.47,"but I quickly found,"
455.39,"was that if I consumed enough salt,"
457.3,usually I would do this in the form
458.38,of putting a little pinch
of,"salt into some water,"
460.84,adding a little lemon juice
or,"something like that,"
462.38,or salting my food a little bit more.
464.41,That I lost any kind of
shakiness,"in my hands,"
468.09,"that my mental functioning was better,"
469.94,my sports performance
was,"better, et cetera."
472.2,So it was really interesting
to,see that shift simply
474.39,"by increasing my salt intake,"
476.07,"something that's really counterintuitive,"
477.41,to a lot of what's out there.
480.28,Salt isn't just important
for,"the function of neurons,"
482.54,it's important for blood volume
484.34,and working alongside the
other,"electrolytes, magnesium"
487.25,"and potassium,"
488.26,it ensures that cells in
our,body function properly.
491.12,And I think we're starting
to,"see a shift out there now,"
494.33,in the perception of what salt
495.687,and the other electrolytes do.
497.507,"And really seeing magnesium,"
499.66,which is one of the
"electrolytes,",potassium
502.343,"and especially salt, as not"
necessarily,"something to avoid,"
504.8,"but in fact something to embrace,"
506.43,provided that they're used properly.
508.45,"LMNT is formulated to help anyone,"
510.466,reach their electrolyte needs
512.57,and is particularly well-suited
to,"people following a keto,"
514.92,low carb or paleo diet.
516.78,For people following a low carb diet
519.3,"or doing intermittent fasting,"
520.87,"what many people don't know,"
522.15,is that carbohydrate holds water.
524.04,It actually brings water into the system
526.21,and you don't want your
system,"to be low on water,"
528.41,that's one form of dehydration..
530.63,"Salt holds water as well,"
532.47,"meaning it keeps the water in your system,"
535.31,which is beneficial for
brain,and body function.
537.62,LMNT contains a science-backed
electrolyte,ratio
540.06,"of 1000 milligrams,"
that's,"one gram of sodium,"
543.46,200 milligrams of potassium
and,60 milligrams of magnesium.
547.14,And they use the very best
forms,"of salt, potassium,"
550.38,and magnesium that are out there.
552.56,"So the way I use LMNT, is I"
usually,will mix up one packet
555.89,into about 16 to 30 ounces
of,water in the morning
558.7,and drink that first thing
560.01,in the morning when I wake up
561.46,"or around breakfast time,"
doesn't,really matter.
563.33,I kind of sip on it through the morning
564.65,"or if I'm really thirsty,"
I'll,drink it all at once.
566.43,And then I always make sure
to,drink a volume of water
569.9,"with an LMNT packet in it,"
somewhere,around my exercise.
572.38,"Sometimes it's during the exercise,"
574.21,"if I'm running, I'll"
wait,until afterwards.
576.27,"I'll hydrate with it before and after,"
578.06,if it's a really hot day.
579.26,"If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to"
580.651,"drinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T.com/huberman,"
585.04,to claim a free element sample pack.
586.86,"You only cover the cost of shipping,"
588.6,otherwise it's completely free.
590.25,"Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman"
593.44,to claim a free sample pack.
595.25,Today's episode is also brought
to,us by Athletic Greens.
598.13,Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one,"vitamin mineral,"
600.5,probiotic drink.
601.98,I've been taking Athletic
Greens,"since 2012,"
604.46,so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
606.9,The reason I started
taking,Athletic Greens
608.337,and the reason I still
take,"Athletic Greens,"
610.6,is that it covers all of
my,"foundational vitamin,"
612.83,"mineral, probiotic needs."
614.82,We of course need vitamins.
616.01,We of course need minerals
617.56,and we do need a healthy gut microbiome
620.45,"and probiotics, support"
a,healthy gut microbiome.
623.74,There is now a wealth of quality
scientific,"published data,"
627.0,"showing that the microbiota,"
628.71,meaning the little microbes
that,"live in our gut,"
631.14,are good for us.
632.019,"And our gut when it functions properly,"
634.75,communicates with our brain
635.85,and our brain communicates with our gut
637.42,"through the so-called, gut-brain axis."
639.63,"And that gut-brain axis,"
640.87,"is vital for things like immune system,"
643.239,"endocrine system, meaning hormones"
645.5,and for mood and overall brain function.
647.86,"With Athletic Greens, I get my vitamins,"
649.46,"my minerals and the probiotics I need,"
651.76,to support a healthy gut
microbiome,and gut-brain axis
655.2,without having to worry
about,taking a bunch
657.19,of other things.
658.15,"In fact, when people ask me,"
659.21,"what's the one supplement I should take,"
661.0,that's going to make me feel better?
662.49,I always say Athletic Greens
663.87,because indeed it makes me feel better
665.75,and it happens to taste terrific.
667.34,"I drink it twice a day, typically,"
669.38,"I'll have one in the morning,"
670.52,I mix it with water and a little
bit,of lemon or lime juice.
673.56,And I'll typically have
it,again in the afternoon
675.72,"or late afternoon,"
677.0,"again, mixed with water,"
some,lemon or lime juice.
679.54,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,"
681.16,"you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,"
683.97,to claim a special offer.
685.36,"They'll give you five free travel packs,"
686.85,that make it really easy
to,"mix up Athletic Greens,"
688.82,while you're in the car or
traveling,"by plane, et cetera."
691.85,"Plus, they'll give you a year"
supply,of vitamin D3 + K2.
695.62,Many of us are deficient in vitamin D3
697.89,and even for those of us
699.19,"that are getting sufficient sunshine,"
700.64,many of us still need to
supplement,with vitamin D3.
703.35,Vitamin D3 is involved in
"metabolism,","immune system,"
705.82,"brain function, hormones, et cetera."
708.05,"It has so many important functions,"
709.42,and K2 has been shown to be important
711.24,"for a variety of things,"
712.43,"not the least, which is"
cardiovascular,health.
714.6,"So again, if you go to"
"athleticgreens.com/huberman,",
717.28,you can claim a special offer.
718.5,"They'll give you five free travel packs,"
719.9,plus a year supply of vitamin D3 + K2.
722.5,"Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,"
725.43,to claim this special offer.
727.02,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by ROKA.
729.68,"ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses,"
731.6,that have the absolute highest quality.
733.73,I spent a lifetime working on the science
735.26,of the visual system
736.41,and I can tell you that your
visual,system everywhere
738.63,"from your eyes to your brain,"
739.92,"includes a ton of different mechanisms,"
742.14,so that as you move through
different,"environments,"
744.08,you can see things clearly.
745.68,And even if it's bright
out,or there are shadows
747.572,"or it's really dim outside,"
or,"it's getting dark,"
750.55,that your visual system
can,"try and manage,"
752.93,"to resolve what's out there in the world,"
754.69,so you can see things clearly.
756.03,Many people need corrective
"lenses,",they need eyeglasses.
758.54,"Other people, they need"
sunglasses,"as well,"
760.8,or just simply need sunglasses
762.49,"because if it's too bright,"
it's,very hard to see things.
764.93,One problem with a lot of eyeglasses
766.65,"and sunglasses out there, however,"
768.32,"is they don't take into account,"
770.18,"the nuanced biology, the visual system."
772.61,You may have experienced this.
773.81,Have you ever put on a pair of sunglasses
775.37,that aren't so great?
776.33,You move from a really bright
area,into a dimly lit area
779.58,"and you have to take the eyeglasses off,"
781.42,your eyes just don't seem to adjust.
783.19,"With ROKA, eyeglasses and sunglasses,"
784.98,everything they've done to
design,"those glasses and lenses,"
787.9,is with the science of
the,visual system in mind.
789.78,So you can move seamlessly from
one,environment to the next
792.07,and you always see things
with,crystal clarity.
794.99,Their sunglasses and
eyeglasses,are really terrific
797.12,because they can be used for anything.
798.89,"They have a terrific aesthetic,"
so,"you can wear them,"
801.14,"to work to dinner, et"
"cetera,",they look great.
803.66,"And, they're also designed"
for,"athletic performance,"
806.26,you can use them while
running,"or while cycling,"
808.8,"if you get sweaty, they"
won't,slip off your face.
810.63,"They're extremely lightweight,"
811.97,"in fact, I often forget that"
they're,even on my face.
814.23,I wear readers at night
and,sometimes when I drive
816.75,and I wear sunglasses when
it's,really bright outside
819.23,and I need sunglasses.
820.72,If you want to try ROKA
eyeglasses,"or sunglasses,"
822.98,you can go to roka.com
824.57,That's R-O-K-A.com and
enter,"the code Huberman,"
827.93,to save 20% off your first order.
829.94,"Again, that's ROKA,"
830.773,R-O-K-A.com and enter the
code,Huberman at checkout.
834.98,Let's talk about the
science,"and in particular,"
836.76,the biology and neuroscience
of,setting and achieving goals.
841.15,"Setting and achieving goals,"
842.39,is not a uniquely human endeavor.
845.49,Other animals set and
attempt,"to achieve goals,"
848.279,a honeybee attempts to collect honey
850.19,and bring it back to the hive.
851.86,A herbivore will go out
and,forage for plants
854.94,and will also have a need to reproduce
857.63,at some point in its life.
858.64,"So, will need to find a mate"
and,"maybe even raise the young,"
861.84,depending on what species that is.
864.4,Predators will have to hunt
and,kill and eat their food
868.37,and they have to avoid getting
injured,in that process.
870.84,"They also have to raise young, et cetera."
872.9,"So humans are among the other animals,"
875.56,or we could say the animals are among us
878.07,in the need to set goals
879.91,and to make efforts to
achieve,those goals.
883.26,"Now, why do I emphasize"
this,commonality of process?
886.29,The reason I emphasize this
commonality,"of process,"
888.84,is that it turns out that
there,is one basic system
892.4,"by which all animals, including humans,"
894.91,set and attempt to achieve goals.
896.54,Now humans are unique in our
ability,to orient our mind
901.49,"toward immediate goals,"
moderately,"termed goals,"
904.99,meaning things that might
exist,on the scale of a week
907.11,or a month or even a year
908.75,"and very long-term goals,"
like,a lifetime goal
912.12,"or a goal that lasts a decade,"
913.81,or it takes a decade to achieve.
915.81,That's what makes us unique.
917.36,And of course we don't
have,access to the mindset
919.49,or the thinking or the
emotions,"of other animals,"
922.06,"but what we do know is that,"
common,"neural circuits,"
925.26,"meaning brain areas,"
926.34,that are present in animal
species,"and in humans,"
930.08,are responsible for orienting
our,thinking and our action
934.19,toward particular goals.
935.83,Another thing that's really
unique,"about the human brain,"
938.82,is that we are able to have
multiple,goals interacting
941.88,at once.
942.75,"So, for instance, we probably"
all,"have fitness goals,"
946.44,goals in relationships of
different,"kinds, friendships,"
948.75,and romantic partnerships
950.17,as well as maybe scholastic goals.
952.34,Maybe you're in school
953.49,or you're pursuing some
kind,of learning outside
955.23,of the school environment
956.49,"or indoor, you have business"
goals,"or financial goals,"
960.15,we are able to have
multiple,goals at once.
962.127,"And other animals do this,"
963.36,but humans are unique in the ability
965.0,to juggle a lot of goals.
966.72,And actually one of the major
challenges,"in pursuing goals,"
969.26,"is that goal pursuit often interacts,"
971.88,meaning if you can spend 100%
974.09,"of your time chasing one particular goal,"
976.15,that might be very
effective,"for that goal,"
977.88,but then we tend to fall back
on,some of our other goals.
980.82,You can imagine how this plays out.
982.21,"If you're working very, very hard,"
984.69,"you're solely focused on business often,"
985.523,your health will suffer.
988.05,If you're solely focused
on,"your health often,"
989.87,other things will suffer.
990.75,And so we have to juggle
both,our goal setting
992.7,and our goal pursuits.
993.55,"And so today, we're going"
to,talk about a number
995.16,"of different ways,"
996.26,to work with what could
very,"well be called,"
998.61,"these interleaving goals,"
1000.47,by focusing on a common practice
or,common set of mechanisms
1005.268,that are present in all
aspects,of goal seeking.
1009.02,What is that process?
1010.47,"Well, it turns out, it's a neural circuit."
1013.19,"A neural circuit, is simply"
a,"collection of brain areas,"
1016.62,that when active in a
particular,sequence give rise
1019.96,to a particular behavior or perception.
1022.95,"So for instance, when you feel happy,"
1025.41,"it's not because you have a brain area,"
1027.1,"that's the happy brain area,"
that,is electrically active.
1031.02,"Rather, it's going to"
involve,"numerous brain areas,"
1034.25,being active in concert
and,to different degrees.
1036.73,"In the same way, that the"
keys,"on a piano, together,"
1041.29,"played in the appropriate sequence,"
1043.76,represent a particular song.
1045.55,You would never say that one key
1046.93,"on the piano represents that song,"
1048.45,but that key is necessary.
1050.29,"Similarly, in the brain,"
1051.71,we can say that a brain
area,"might be necessary,"
1053.86,but not sufficient to give
us,a particular experience
1057.26,or generate a particular behavior.
1058.95,So when we think about goal
seeking,and the pursuit of goals
1062.41,"of any kind in the brain,"
1063.77,it doesn't matter what the goal is.
1065.97,It involves a common
set,of neural circuits
1069.23,and the neural circuit
that,I'd like to orient us
1071.58,toward today.
1072.413,"And we will return to it a few times,"
1073.88,"involves learning a couple of names,"
1075.5,but you don't have to worry so
much,about memorizing these.
1077.74,Just more important is
to,understand the logic
1080.54,of how it's put together
1081.39,and I will explain that
and,make it very clear.
1083.16,If you want to learn
the,"names, that's great."
1085.16,One of the brain areas is
the,"so-called, amygdala."
1087.28,The amygdala is most often
associated,"with fear,"
1089.67,"so you might say, wow,"
1090.503,how is that involved in
goal,directed behavior?
1093.27,"Well, a lot of our goal directed behavior,"
1095.28,"is to avoid punishments,"
1097.32,including things like
embarrassment,or financial ruin
1100.36,or things of that sort.
1101.78,And so the amygdala and some
sense,"of anxiety or fear,"
1104.98,is actually built in to the circuits
1106.92,that generate goal seeking
1108.532,and our motivation to pursuit goals.
1111.18,The other areas are the
"so-called,",ventral striatum.
1115.18,The striatum is part of what's
"called,",the basal ganglia.
1118.03,"The basal ganglia, is a neural circuit,"
1120.15,that can very simply be
described,as a neural circuit
1123.04,"that helps us generate go,"
meaning,the initiation of action
1126.65,"and no-go, the prevention"
of,action type scenarios.
1131.52,Let me make that even simpler.
1132.95,The ventral striatum is
part,"of this thing called,"
1134.78,the basal ganglia.
1135.613,The basal ganglia has sort
of,two circuits within it.
1138.69,One circuit is involved in
getting,"us to do things,"
1140.77,like I'm going to get up tomorrow
1142.25,and I'm going to run five miles
first,thing in the morning.
1145.034,I don't know if I'm
actually,"going to do that,"
1145.95,but I'm just using that as an example.
1148.12,"Another circuit within the basal ganglia,"
1150.08,"is a no-go circuit, it's"
the,"one that says, no,"
1152.3,I'm not going to go for the second cookie
1154.94,or the third cookie.
1156.12,I'm not going to eat that.
1158.03,And then the go circuit would
be,the one that's responsible
1160.38,for instead eating something else.
1162.73,"Okay, so we have go and no-go circuits"
1164.6,within the basal ganglia.
1166.16,"So we've got amygdala,"
1167.48,so what you think of as
kind,of fear and anxiety
1169.3,and avoidance.
1170.2,"We've got, the basal ganglia,"
1172.04,which are for initiating
action,and preventing action.
1175.05,"And then there is the so-called, cortex."
1177.73,The cortex is the outer
shell,"of the brain,"
1179.47,and there are two sub
regions,"of the cortex,"
1181.03,that are involved in
goal-directed,behavior.
1183.4,"One is the lateral prefrontal cortex,"
1185.41,"prefrontal cortex is involved in,"
1186.91,"so-called, executive function,"
things,like planning.
1189.71,Thinking about things
under,"different timescales,"
1191.88,so not just what we want
in,"the immediate term,"
1194.05,but what we might want
tomorrow,or the next day
1196.9,and how our actions currently
are,"going to relate,"
1198.84,to the future.
1199.91,"And the so-called, orbitofrontal cortex,"
1202.158,orbitofrontal cortex has a
large,"number of functions,"
1205.53,but one of the key functions
of,"the orbitofrontal cortex,"
1208.09,it's involved in meshing some emotionality
1210.78,with our current state of progress
1213.63,and comparing that emotionality
to,"where it might be,"
1217.61,when we are closer to a goal.
1220.129,"So, there are basically four areas,"
1221.97,"one involved in anxiety,"
one,"involved in emotion,"
1226.02,one involved in planning
1227.41,and another involved in
this,"go, no-go action."
1230.43,"So that's a bunch of detail,"
1231.53,but if I wanted to make it
really,"simple for everyone,"
1234.17,I would say there are four areas.
1236.03,One is an area associated
with,"anxiety and fear,"
1238.963,it's the amygdala.
1240.13,The second is involved
in,"action and inaction,"
1243.66,"remember go, and no-go, so"
that's,the basal ganglia.
1247.03,The other one is involved
in,planning and thinking
1250.97,"across different timescales,"
1252.17,so that's lateral prefrontal cortex.
1253.96,"And then the fourth one, is"
involved,"in emotionality,"
1257.99,"where we sit emotionally present,"
1260.55,compared to where we think
we,"will be emotionally,"
1263.07,when we reach some particular goal
1265.32,and that's the orbitofrontal cortex.
1267.72,"Again, you don't need"
to,know all those names.
1269.8,"You don't need to know all the details,"
1271.72,just understand that those
different,elements are involved
1275.01,in the decision-making
processes,that lead us
1277.82,toward particular goals
1278.89,and have us update our
goal,"seeking, et cetera."
1282.11,One key thing is it doesn't
matter,"what the goal is,"
1285.775,the same circuits are involved.
1288.39,So whether or not you're
trying,"to build a company,"
1290.91,that's a billion dollar company
1291.743,"that's going to go public,"
1293.16,or you're thinking about
planning,a craft day at home
1295.85,"with the kids or for yourself,"
1297.48,or you're thinking about
what,movie to go see.
1299.35,"Goals, goal seeking and"
assessing,"progress towards goals,"
1302.38,all involve the exact
same,neural circuits.
1305.36,It's really remarkable.
1306.48,It's also very convenient
for,our discussion today.
1309.83,"What's going on in these circuits,"
1311.66,can basically be boiled down
to,two particular things.
1315.41,"The first is, value information,"
1317.96,"trying to understand whether or not,"
1319.53,something is really worth pursuing or not.
1322.65,"So, placing a value on a particular goal."
1325.66,The other component of
this,"neural circuit,"
1328.13,"is associated with action,"
1329.76,which actions to take and
which,"actions not to take,"
1333.3,given the value of a particular goal
1336.45,in a given moments time.
1338.53,I want to say that again.
1339.58,The other component of the
circuit,"is involved in action,"
1342.996,whether or not you should
act,"or should not act,"
1346.45,based on your assessment
of,the value of a goal
1349.98,at a particular moment in time.
1352.38,And you're going to hear
me,"say over and over again,"
1354.79,"in this episode,"
1355.623,the value information
about,a goal is so key.
1358.68,"Here's why, there is basically"
one,neuro-transmitter
1362.74,"or rather neuromodulator system,"
1365.71,that governs our goal
"setting,",goal assessment
1368.436,and goal pursuit.
1370.14,And that is the neuromodulator dopamine.
1371.95,Dopamine is the common currency
1373.96,by which we assess our progress
1376.47,toward particular things
of,particular value.
1379.24,"In fact, dopamine, is the"
way,that we assess value
1382.85,of our pursuits.
1384.06,"And so, as we take a moment"
and,"we shift our attention,"
1388.15,to the psychology of goal setting.
1390.27,The things that you've probably
heard,"a bit more about,"
1392.41,about what sorts of goals
are,good and how to set goals
1395.18,and how to categorize goals.
1396.94,"I want you to think about how dopamine,"
1399.51,could possibly be involved
in,these different processes.
1402.69,"And the reason I want you to do this,"
1404.24,is that all of the
psychology,of goal setting
1407.35,"and goal pursuit, is wonderful"
1408.86,because it places things
into,different categories.
1411.42,It allows us to parse our thinking
1413.18,and organize our thinking.
1414.78,"But what's not often seen,"
1416.41,"in fact, I'm not aware of"
any,"literature out there,"
1418.61,scientific or literature
in,the popular press
1422.26,"or in popular books,"
1423.171,is an understanding of how
the,"underlying neurobiology,"
1427.53,can be layered on top of the
psychology,"of goal setting,"
1431.57,to allow us to set and pursue
our,goals more effectively.
1434.82,And that's what we're going to do today.
1436.0,We are eventually going to arrive
1437.65,"at a set of four practices,"
1439.56,"that when performed on a regular basis,"
1441.43,"will allow you to assess,"
1442.68,what is the value of this
next,particular action step?
1446.87,"How worthwhile is it, to do"
behavior,A versus behavior B
1451.5,in order to achieve a particular goal?
1453.66,"If any of this is vague now,"
1455.22,I'm going to make it
all,very clear for you.
1457.95,You're going to come away
with,some very specific lists
1460.87,of takeaways that you can put
down,"on paper, if you like."
1463.6,And that you can use to
set,"goals, assess goals,"
1466.63,"and execute goals more effectively,"
1468.62,using the neuroscience of
the,circuits I just described
1471.7,and an understanding of the
neuromodulator,dopamine.
1474.7,Let's take a look at the
psychology,of goal setting
1477.15,and goal pursuit.
1478.43,"This is an enormous literature,"
1480.21,"meaning there are tens of thousands,"
1481.74,if not hundreds of thousands
of,scientific papers
1484.73,about the topic of goal
setting,and goal pursuit.
1488.23,There's also a lot of
information,on the internet
1490.17,about goal pursuit.
1491.55,"And in looking over this information,"
1494.2,"one comes to appreciate pretty quickly,"
1496.55,that acronyms are a big thing.
1499.54,"Acronyms, seem to dominate"
the,"area of goal setting,"
1503.27,especially as it relates to
things,"in the business sector,"
1505.81,but also in the relationship sector.
1507.43,"Now, acronyms are wonderful,"
1508.98,they allow us to organize
our,thinking into less
1511.573,and conceptually they can be very useful.
1514.41,"But as I moved through this literature,"
1515.98,I started to see some redundant themes.
1518.01,"And so what I've attempted to do,"
1519.41,"is distill out the redundant themes,"
1521.4,that regardless of the person teaching
1523.55,or the scientific laboratory
that,happened to come up
1526.61,"with these acronyms,"
1528.216,that they boil down to
some,common features.
1532.06,So let's talk about that literature
1533.25,and I think we'll come
away,with an understanding
1534.98,of some basic elements that
are,common to all goals.
1539.36,"Now, the modern science or the"
modern,psychological science
1543.32,of trying to understand
goal,"setting and pursuit,"
1546.21,actually dates back to the 1930s.
1548.24,And we have to be sure that
members,"of our species,"
1550.75,were focused on goal
setting,"and goal pursuit,"
1552.68,long before the scientific
literature,emerged.
1555.26,"It just stands to reason that,"
1556.357,since the human brain
hasn't,"evolved that much,"
1559.03,"we don't think, in the last 10,000 years,"
1561.78,that people would be
thinking,about these things.
1564.16,They just didn't get
them,"down into papers,"
1565.85,that we could evaluate
on,"PubMed and so forth,"
1567.79,"but now we can,"
1568.623,so we can look at those papers.
1569.88,And what you find is
that,acronyms are abound
1572.52,in the psychology literature
1574.05,about goal setting and goal pursuit.
1576.0,"So for instance, you'll"
hear,about the work
1579.38,"of Larkin Small, for instance,"
1581.414,these are the last names
of,various researchers.
1584.69,"The so-called, ABC method, that"
a,"goal should be achievable,"
1588.68,"it should be believable,"
1589.93,and that the person be committed.
1591.26,It's sort of obvious once you
hear,about the ABC method.
1593.57,Then people came along
and,"expanded on that,"
1595.99,they talked about the
"so-called,",SMART method.
1597.93,"SMART being another acronym,"
that,"it be specific,"
1600.68,"that the goal be measurable,"
1602.02,"that the goal be attainable,"
1603.27,that the goal be realistic
and,"that it be time-bound,"
1605.76,meaning that you set up
certain,period of time
1607.77,in which a given goal should be performed.
1610.33,And then people come
along,"and modify these,"
1612.16,this is the way that
psychology,research is done.
1613.95,I'm not laughing at it.
1615.15,"I'm just chuckling because,"
1616.286,it seems like the acronyms get
longer,and longer and longer.
1619.45,"They developed the, SMARTER approach,"
1621.89,"adding an ER to the acronym,"
"SMART,",S-M-A-R-T-E-R.
1626.61,They added ethical and
"rewarding,","which fortunately,"
1629.97,"are good things I believe,"
ethical,and rewarding.
1633.85,What does all this mean?
1634.83,"Well, what it means is that"
any,"kind of goal pursuit,"
1638.49,"any kind of goal setting,"
1640.34,really has to involve a
number,of different states
1643.38,"and neural circuits in the brain and body,"
1645.83,at least that's how I
view,this literature.
1647.9,Why would I do that?
1648.75,"Well, let's think about"
the,very modern version
1651.81,of the kind of acronyms that
I,"talked about a moment ago,"
1655.14,dating back to the 1930s and
extending,into the 1990s.
1658.93,You can find beautiful talks online
1662.09,from people who have worked
1663.27,with some of the biggest companies
1664.98,"and greatest high performers out there,"
1667.41,to achieve incredible things.
1668.92,And they will talk about generating a sort
1671.48,of objective mindset for goal setting.
1674.52,They'll talk about goals
needing,to be significant.
1677.19,That it has to be a big goal.
That,"it has to be concrete,"
1679.38,so you have to be able to
describe,what the goal is.
1681.14,"It has to be action-oriented,"
1682.63,"has to be inspirational,"
1683.93,has to be time-bound.
1685.24,"You have to have reasonable,"
"realistic,",verifiable measures.
1688.55,You have to constantly up the ante.
1690.54,"If it's starting to sound repetitive,"
1691.9,it's because it is repetitive.
1693.52,There are basically only
three,"or four elements,"
1695.54,to goal setting and goal pursuit.
1697.71,"Basically, an individual"
or,"set of individuals,"
1700.72,has to identify a specific thing
1703.29,that they're going to attain.
1704.3,"In some communities, they talk about,"
1706.9,"knowing what right looks like,"
1709.02,meaning being able to
define,a very specific goal.
1711.99,"You can't just say, I want"
to,be a champion athlete.
1716.43,"You have to say what sport,"
1718.08,and you have to understand
what,the path to that is.
1720.73,"So any big goal of course,"
1721.8,is broken up into a
series,"of smaller goals,"
1724.36,but the whole thing starts with thinking
1725.9,about the end in mind.
1727.17,"And in a few minutes, we will talk about,"
1728.82,whether or not visualization
of,"the end in mind,"
1730.93,is actually beneficial or
detrimental,to achieving goals.
1734.17,There's actually great
neuroscience,and psychology data
1736.46,on that now.
1737.64,"So, I mentioned all these acronyms,"
1739.56,not as an attempt to disparage them.
1741.65,I think they're wonderful.
1742.66,And I mentioned all that
psychology,"literature,"
1744.95,"not in an attempt to disparage it,"
1746.93,"but rather just say that, goal"
setting,"is the first step,"
1751.163,assessment of whether or
not,one is making progress
1754.29,towards those goals is the
second,but necessary step.
1756.72,And then there's the
business,of goal execution.
1759.31,And that brings us back to
the,"neural circuit components,"
1761.58,"remember, this neural circuit,"
1762.91,"involving those four things earlier,"
1764.41,"the amygdala, striatum,"
orbitofrontal,cortex
1766.96,and the prefrontal cortex.
1769.38,"They work together,"
1770.35,to divide the whole process
as,"I mentioned before,"
1772.53,into two general categories.
1774.48,"The first is, assessing value,"
1776.67,knowing whether or not where
one,"is at one given moment,"
1779.9,relates to some external thing.
1782.64,Are things going well
or,things going poorly?
1785.64,And knowing how to gauge that accurately.
1787.87,"And then, action steps, goes and no goes,"
1790.87,"do more of this, do less of that,"
1792.3,"do this, don't do that, et cetera."
1794.5,"So, now we are going to shift"
back,to the neuroscience
1797.43,and we're going to talk about
the,practical applications
1800.44,of the information I just described.
1802.3,Because I've given you a lot
1803.15,of kind of academic information.
1804.65,"And as we do this, I'd"
like,"you to keep in mind,"
1808.03,what are some things that
you've,either accomplished
1810.28,or that you'd like to
accomplish,going forward?
1812.68,"Because as we do this,"
1813.61,"we can build toward a set of protocols,"
1815.36,"that at the end, you'll be"
able,"to very quickly plug in,"
1817.82,your particular goals and a
route,"to those particular goals,"
1821.32,that's grounded in the science.
1822.363,That I think are going
to,be very effective
1824.49,in allowing you to reach
those,"goals, more quickly"
1827.0,and with indeed less effort.
1829.45,"In fact, let's start with a tool now"
1832.01,because as we move through
all,"this information,"
1835.18,I want to make sure that
people,are coming away
1837.63,with some practical things
that,they can implement.
1839.84,"And indeed, some things"
that,you can even do
1841.42,during the course of listening
to,or watching this podcast.
1846.4,"The first thing to do, is"
to,understand the difference
1848.97,between peripersonal space
and,extra personal space.
1852.93,"Peripersonal space, is"
all,"the space, literally,"
1857.039,"that's within inside your body,"
1859.51,the surface of your skin and
in,your immediate environment.
1862.79,"Peripersonal space, is a"
key,concept in neuroscience
1866.46,because you have
particular,neural circuits
1868.107,"and particular chemicals,"
1870.05,"that are geared toward,"
1871.44,what are called consummatory
"behaviors,","meaning,"
1874.07,using things and consuming
things,"and enjoying things,"
1876.84,that are in your immediate
peripersonal,space.
1879.87,Let me give you an example
of,"this for myself,"
1881.88,just to make it concrete.
1883.09,You can imagine similar
examples,for yourself right now.
1885.98,Within my current peripersonal
"space,","is my interoception,"
1891.231,my understanding or perception
of,my internal body.
1894.44,"So, how quickly I'm"
"breathing,","my heart rate,"
1897.11,the feelings on the surface
of,"my skin, et cetera."
1899.96,"But also, within the confines"
of,"my peripersonal space,"
1903.42,"is this coffee mug,"
1904.34,that if you're listening to
"this,","you can't see this,"
1905.93,"but I'm lifting up a coffee mug,"
1907.71,I'm going to take a sip of coffee.
1910.04,That's a consummatory
"behavior,","I have the coffee,"
1912.28,I don't have to do much or
motivate,much to get it.
1915.08,"I have other things here,"
pens,"and computer, et cetera."
1917.447,So things in your peripersonal space
1919.93,"and consuming those things,"
1921.622,is generally governed by
a,"set of neurochemicals,"
1924.576,that center around the
neuromodulator,serotonin.
1928.28,"And there are a few others as well,"
1929.55,"things like oxytocin,"
but,mainly serotonin.
1932.97,"Contrast that, with the"
"so-called,",extra personal space.
1936.11,Extrapersonal space is everything
1937.58,beyond the confines of my reach.
1939.43,It would be something in the next room.
1941.15,It will be something down the street.
1942.83,It will be something
at,"some other location,"
1945.614,in space and time.
1947.663,And the neuromodulators
and,"neurochemicals,"
1950.72,that are associated with
any,"kind of thinking about,"
1953.88,"anything in the extra personal space,"
1956.03,are distinct from the
neurochemicals,"and neuromodulators,"
1958.46,that are involved in thinking
about,or making actions
1961.55,towards the peripersonal space.
1963.75,And the molecule that's most
associated,with thinking about
1967.03,or orienting toward the
extra,"personal space,"
1969.3,"again, things beyond"
the,confines of my skin
1971.3,"or your skin, is dopamine."
1974.0,And this is a vitally important
concept,"to understand,"
1976.82,when you're setting
goals,and seeking goals.
1980.61,"If we are to be good at goal seeking,"
1983.82,if we are to be good at setting
goals,"and assessing goals,"
1987.62,"if we are to achieve our goals,"
1989.84,we have to be able to
toggle,back and forth
1993.91,between a clear understanding
of,"our peripersonal space,"
1998.48,what we have and how we feel
in,the immediate present.
2002.27,And our ability to
understand,what's out there
2006.02,in the extra personal space
2008.2,and our ability to move into
that,extra personal space.
2011.86,"And a simple way to conceive of all this,"
2013.76,is that we evaluate our progress
in,the peripersonal space.
2018.83,"We evaluate how we feel,"
about,"some pursuit,"
2022.282,even if we haven't
initiated,that pursuit yet.
2025.25,"How we feel about a particular goal,"
2027.47,is truly a feeling that we
experience,"in the here and now,"
2030.16,even though the goal is in the future.
2034.07,If we are going to
evaluate,"whether or not,"
2035.67,we made progress today
or,"yesterday or not,"
2038.45,that's an evaluation of how we feel
2040.8,in the immediate peripersonal space.
2044.1,"However, moving toward any goal,"
2046.98,involves orienting our thinking
2049.2,towards the extra personal space.
2052.774,"And as we go through today's episode,"
2053.73,I'm going to teach you a technique
2055.37,"or rather a neuroscience-based tool,"
2057.69,that will allow you to continually
transition,back and forth
2061.04,between the peripersonal space
and,the extra personal space
2064.59,in a way that will allow
you,to update and evaluate
2068.28,and better execute your goal seeking.
2072.03,The whole principle behind
"this,","is that human beings,"
2075.05,"like other animals,"
have,to make evaluations
2077.7,about whether or not they
are,on the right track.
2080.55,"However, the important"
thing,"to understand,"
2082.5,is that humans in particular can do this
2085.105,over different timescales.
2087.14,We don't just pursue food
'cause,"we are hungry,"
2089.16,"we pursue food, excuse"
"me,","for a particular meal,"
2093.24,that we might be having
with,people tomorrow.
2095.7,We can modulate the timescale
2097.29,in a way that other animals don't.
2099.07,"That's how we adjust our goal seeking,"
2100.95,to different timescales.
2102.43,"And in addition to that,"
2104.4,humans are exquisitely good
at,biasing our behavior
2108.21,toward particular goals over
very,long periods of time.
2112.04,"But there are a lot of mistakes out there,"
2113.81,"in fact, things that are"
outright,wrong in the literature
2116.32,"and in particular, in the internet,"
2117.59,and then the kind of wellness and fitness
2119.47,"and cognitive fitness space,"
2121.83,that send people down the wrong path
2124.57,and those things we will
talk,about in a few minutes.
2127.17,"But things like visualization,"
that,visualization
2130.33,"and visualization of this big goal,"
2132.01,is the best way to achieve your goals.
2134.29,"In fact, that's not the case,"
2136.21,there's a much approach to doing all this.
2138.89,So now I'd like to shift gears
2140.55,"towards talking about a few of the things,"
2142.5,that most people get badly wrong
2144.68,in setting and assessing
and,executing goals.
2148.72,"This is based on peer reviewed research,"
2150.87,so I think it's very solid.
2152.46,I know it is very solid.
2153.98,And it runs counter to what
many,of us have been taught.
2157.6,Let's start with a simple one.
2159.07,We've all heard that multitasking is bad.
2161.74,We've heard multitasking is
"bad,",it doesn't allow for focus.
2164.38,"If you want to achieve anything,"
2165.53,if you want to accomplish
"anything,",you should not multitask.
2168.87,"Well, it turns out, that's wrong."
2171.04,It turns out that there is
a,"role for multitasking,"
2174.37,but the multitasking has to
be,placed at a particular time
2178.55,within your goal seeking behavior
2181.27,in order to be effective.
2183.245,Really nice studies done at
Carnegie,"Mellon University,"
2187.55,"and the Davis Lab,"
2189.21,evaluated how long
people,are able to focus
2191.94,in different environments.
2193.31,How long they were able to stay
concentrated,on their work.
2195.9,And it turns out that
number,is exceedingly low.
2198.83,"It turns out that most people,"
2200.57,whether or not they're doing computer work
2202.39,or whether or not they're doing writing
2204.13,or accounting work or
anything,"of that sort,"
2207.22,can hold their attention for
about,three minutes at a time
2209.99,before they shift their attention off.
2212.31,And that's ridiculously
low,"when you first hear it,"
2215.49,"but, that probably reflects a"
basic,state of brain function.
2219.9,That hearkens back to a time
when,"we were hunter gatherers,"
2222.82,I doubt that we were maintaining
focus,solidly for hours
2225.88,"and hours and hours,"
2226.713,unless we were under
some,particular threat
2228.51,or in some particular crisis.
2230.93,"Rather, you could imagine"
that,people collected seeds
2233.27,and nuts and berries
for,about three minutes
2234.69,"and then probably stood up, looked around"
2236.03,and then kept going.
2236.863,Or that they were hunting animals
2239.17,"or in some sort of pursuit,"
"fishing,","et cetera,"
2241.81,"and focused, focused, focused"
2243.25,and every three minutes or
"so,",they might've looked up
2244.94,"and, you know, take a look at the sky"
2246.51,or looked around to make sure
that,other people were there
2249.08,"or not there, et cetera."
2250.6,It all stands to reason
that,that will be the case.
2252.27,"Again, the neural circuits"
haven't,evolved much.
2254.69,"Now, multitasking, has been shown"
2257.34,to have a very interesting
physiological,"signature,"
2261.43,"when we multitask,"
2262.48,when we jump back and
forth,"between things,"
2265.36,there is an increase in the
level,"of the neurotransmitter,"
2269.14,"also sometimes called a neuromodulator,"
2270.93,but basically same thing
for,sake of this discussion.
2273.27,There's an increase in the
neurotransmitter,"epinephrine,"
2275.63,which is adrenaline.
2277.09,"And so, there are really nice studies now,"
2279.47,pointing the fact that doing
a,"bit of multitasking prior,"
2283.46,"to jumping into some focused,"
goal,"directed behavior,"
2287.19,whether or not it's mental
behavior,"or physical behavior,"
2289.1,can actually be useful
2290.54,because it gets us into action.
2292.57,So we've all been told that
multitasking,"is terrible,"
2294.97,"but if you, for instance,"
2295.94,find yourself cleaning up your house
2297.4,and also checking your phone
and,"doing a number of things,"
2299.29,right at the point where you
should,be sitting down to write
2302.12,or do some focused work.
2303.65,It probably reflects
some,"adaptive mechanism,"
2306.05,where you use action and somewhat
varied,multitasking action
2309.81,in order to generate
adrenaline,"in your system,"
2311.86,because adrenaline just
gets,you in the action.
2314.49,"Now, that's great,"
2316.68,"but, you don't want to multitask"
2318.53,throughout any kind of goal seeking
2320.09,or goal pursuit behavior.
2322.02,"Because, what's also very clear"
2324.25,and we're going to talk about
this,"in exquisite depth today,"
2327.95,is that visual focus
2329.86,and in particular contracting
your,"visual window,"
2332.21,bringing the aperture of what
you,"see, to a very fine point,"
2336.58,can absolutely increase
your,clarity of goal seeking
2341.4,and the likelihood that
you,will pursue your goals.
2344.66,I've talked about this a little
bit,before on the podcast
2346.72,as a way of increasing focus
for,any kind of pursuit.
2349.97,"I've talked about a practice,"
2351.17,whereby you can literally
look,"at a dot or a line,"
2355.03,placed on a wall or on your
computer,in front of you
2357.31,"for 30 to 60 seconds,"
2359.45,"and then moving into some dedicated work,"
2361.85,where you need to focus.
2362.75,"And indeed, just looking at a narrow piece"
2365.35,"of the visual world, a small"
piece,of the visual world
2367.68,for some period of time
2368.513,and forcing yourself to hold
that,gaze on that location
2371.4,"as best you can,"
2372.95,can increase your level
of,cognitive attention
2375.48,and your ability to
focus,and stay focused.
2378.24,And this is not magic.
2379.83,"It is the consequence of the fact,"
2381.16,that most of your cognition
follows,your visual perception.
2385.13,For those of you that are
low,"vision or no vision,"
2387.04,"meaning you're blind, or"
you,"have trouble seeing,"
2389.348,"my lab does a lot of work with people,"
2392.35,"who are low vision, no vision."
2394.12,They tend to use their
auditory,"system, their hearing,"
2396.59,as a way to anchor their
attention,to particular things.
2399.35,But most people out there
can,see and see pretty well
2402.42,and visual focus is the way to do that.
2405.92,"Now, earlier, we were"
talking,about this notion
2408.85,of peripersonal space
versus,extra personal space.
2413.44,And I'm just going to seed a little bit
2415.21,"of the later conversation by saying,"
2418.134,that when we focus on an external point.
2420.88,"We are in a process of exteroception,"
2422.427,"is the focus on the extra personal space,"
2425.57,not the peripersonal space.
2429.038,"So when we focus on something,"
say,a line on the wall
2432.12,for 30 to 60 seconds or at our computer
2434.28,for 30 to 60 seconds and just look at it
2436.33,"and then move into any kind of action,"
2438.85,whether or not it's work
action,or physical action.
2441.37,We are at its very core.
2443.64,We are engaging in this pursuit
of,extra personal space.
2446.84,We are placing our focus outside our body
2449.24,and therefore we are placing the brain
2451.31,into goal pursuit mode.
2454.81,"Work at NYU, in particular,"
in,the laboratory
2457.72,of a phenomenal researcher in
their,"Psychology Department,"
2461.04,by the name of Emily
"Balcetis,",B-A-L-C-E-T-I-S.
2465.47,"Emily Balcetis, has done"
really,nice work on this.
2468.85,"They've done is, they've had,"
2470.46,people focus their visual attention
2472.55,on a goal line of some sort
2474.58,and then to engage in
some,"sort of behavior,"
2477.6,that requires a lot of effort.
2478.9,And they've done a lot of
different,"experiments like this,"
2481.31,but I'll just explain one.
2482.62,"They always include a control group,"
2484.28,where people have to go through
the,same physical effort
2487.46,"or mental effort,"
2488.58,but they don't focus their
attention,just on one location.
2492.76,The long and short of
these,"studies is that,"
2494.73,when people have to focus their
attention,"on one location,"
2497.94,"like a goal line,"
2499.3,they are much more effective
in,reaching those goals
2502.06,"and they achieve them with the perception,"
2505.11,that they expended less effort.
2507.07,I'll give you an example of
one,particularly nice study
2509.62,from the Balcetis Lab.
2510.99,So this particular study
"involves,",physical exercise.
2514.09,"Although, as I mentioned before,"
2515.06,they've done similar studies
looking,at cognitive type work.
2518.48,And what they did is they
had,"a group of people,"
2521.305,"exercise, wearing 15 pound ankle weights,"
2525.4,and they had to basically
move,a certain distance
2527.64,or run a certain distance
to,reach a goal line.
2530.31,"One group was focused on the goal line,"
2532.56,"visually focused, on the goal line."
2534.31,The other group was not
told,to visually focus
2536.79,on the goal line.
2537.73,"And what they found, was"
that,the group that focused
2540.52,"on the goal line, was able"
to,achieve reaching that goal
2545.02,with 17% less effort.
2548.6,They measured effort and
they,got there 23% quicker.
2553.16,That's a remarkable difference.
2555.09,"So same distance traveled,"
with,same workload
2557.85,because everyone's wearing
the,same 15 pound weights
2561.3,on their ankles.
2562.16,One group is simply
looking,"at the goal line,"
2564.44,the other group is not told
to,"look at the goal line,"
2566.72,"simply by looking at the goal line,"
2568.66,does something to the psychology
2570.37,"and end physiology of these people,"
2572.66,that allows them to move forward
2575.34,with less perceived effort
and,to do it more quickly.
2578.4,That's remarkable.
2579.879,"And in this case, they're"
focused,"on the goal line,"
2582.15,"but in a few moments,"
2583.18,we'll talk about how one can
use,"updating of goal line,"
2586.05,so incremental goal line.
2587.18,"Starting with an intermediate goal,"
2588.88,and then extending the goal
line,further and further.
2591.2,But just sit back for a
second,"and think about that,"
2593.45,"just by changing where a person looks,"
2596.9,they changed their perceived effort
2599.07,and their ability to do
"something,","more effectively,"
2602.88,"more quickly, than a group that"
is,not deliberately focusing
2607.13,their visual attention on one location.
2609.38,That's incredible.
2610.38,"And it's so incredible,"
in,"fact, you might say,"
2611.82,"well, how could that possibly be?"
2613.9,"Well, it turns out, it"
has,"a very specific,"
2616.19,underlying physiological reason
2618.18,and that has to do with changes
2620.04,"in our so-called,"
autonomic,nervous system.
2622.09,"The aspects of our nervous system,"
2624.15,"that prepare us for readiness and action,"
2626.82,or that prepare us for
resting,and relaxing.
2630.32,So what is special about
focusing,one's visual attention
2633.58,at a given location?
2635.32,"Well, it turns out that"
we,have two branches
2637.01,of our visual system.
2637.92,So visual information all
comes,"in through our eyes,"
2640.73,but then it can head down
two,different pathways.
2643.48,One pathway is engaged
when,our vision is brought
2646.53,"to a common point,"
2647.363,"what we call, a vergence eye movement."
2648.76,So if we're focusing very
intensely,"on a given point,"
2651.4,regardless of how far away
from,"us that point is,"
2654.51,our visual system engages
a,"certain set of neurons,"
2657.67,neural circuits that are
involved,in resolving fine detail
2661.53,and that can evaluate small changes
2663.59,over small periods of time.
2664.92,Just think of it as a very detailed camera
2667.54,of the visual world.
2668.373,It tends to be very restricted.
2670.22,The other pathway through
the,"visual system,"
2672.29,"is the so-called, magnocellular pathway."
2673.95,And this is a pathway that's involved
2675.52,in taking in global information
about,"lots of things,"
2678.22,that are happening around us.
2679.99,"Movement of things to our right,"
2681.23,"movement of things to our left,"
2682.49,things are happening down on
the,ground and all around us.
2684.75,And that pathway involves a
sort,"of relaxation, if you will,"
2689.71,of the neural circuits that are associated
2691.61,with alertness and attention.
2692.95,When you walk down the street
2693.92,"and you're not thinking about much,"
2694.86,"provided you're not looking at your phone,"
2696.47,"you're not focusing on one location,"
2698.6,"you're more or less in a relaxed state,"
2700.67,compared to when you're
looking,"for a particular sign,"
2702.8,you're looking for a bus
or,"a train that's coming,"
2704.73,or a particular person.
2705.73,"And that should inherently make sense,"
2707.8,when your level of attention
and,"alertness goes up,"
2710.03,"there's sort of a small,"
2711.7,but perceptible increase
in,your level of arousal.
2714.19,"It's not really stress necessarily,"
2716.06,but arousal of alertness.
2718.23,"And it turns out that the visual system,"
2720.69,accomplishes this increase
in,alertness by communicating
2724.46,with your circulatory system
2726.32,and the system that
delivers,blood and nutrients
2728.56,and oxygen to the rest of
the,tissues in your body.
2731.13,So let's talk for a second
about,what focusing our vision
2733.84,on a particular location does
2735.21,because in this study
from,"the Balcetis Lab,"
2737.14,"what they found was, focusing"
on,"a goal line allows people,"
2739.62,to move more effectively toward that goal.
2741.56,This is something you can
leverage,in all aspects
2743.91,of all goal pursuits.
2746.12,What happens when we focus
on,a particular location?
2749.71,"Believe it or not,"
2750.76,there's an increase in
a,particular feature
2752.91,of our blood pressure.
2754.7,"Now your body has, of course, arteries,"
2756.57,"veins and capillaries,"
2758.86,"and your heart pumps blood,"
first,"to the arteries,"
2761.72,and then to the other components
of,your vascular system.
2764.53,"And we have so-called, blood pressure."
2766.97,"Blood pressure is just how much,"
2768.5,the fluid volume is
pressing,"on those arteries,"
2770.87,veins and capillaries.
2772.4,So you can imagine a pipe
with,very little fluid moving
2774.87,"through it, that's low pressure."
2776.03,You have a pipe with a lot
of,"fluid moving through it,"
2778.37,that's even more pressure.
2779.3,You have a pipe with a lot
of,"very viscous, meaning,"
2781.81,"very kind of sticky, thick"
"stuff,","moving forward,"
2784.24,that's even more pressure.
2785.59,We have blood pressure
2786.67,and you've probably had your
blood,pressure measured.
2788.61,There's always two numbers.
2790.04,"You have a top number, which"
is,the systolic blood pressure.
2792.76,And then there's the bottom
"number,","below the line,"
2795.11,which is the diastolic pressure.
2797.24,"So the important thing to understand,"
2798.53,is that your blood pressure
will,"rise when your heart beats,"
2801.36,because there's more fluid
moving,through those pipes
2803.91,that are your arteries or
veins,and your capillaries.
2806.2,And that top number is called the systole
2809.01,"or the systolic blood pressure,"
2810.78,"because that's the pressure at the time,"
2812.89,when your heart contracts.
2814.893,"So the top number, which normally,"
2817.36,"if you have a healthy blood pressure,"
2818.7,is somewhere in the range
of,90 to 120 millimeters
2822.01,of mercury. Millimeters of
mercury,"is just the way,"
2823.71,that pressure is measured.
2824.84,"That top number, your systole,"
2826.913,"or your systolic blood pressure,"
2828.65,is what's measured when
the,heart contracts.
2831.451,"So, that's the amount of"
pressure,when there's a heartbeat
2835.24,and it's moving through your vasculature.
2838.03,"Now, between beats, the"
"heartbeats,","but then it relaxes,"
2842.79,your blood pressure is going
to,drop to a lower value
2845.05,because fluid isn't being
pumped,through the system
2847.1,at those moments.
2848.1,"And that's the bottom,"
the,diastolic pressure.
2851.37,"And typically for healthy people,"
2852.67,that's going to be 60 to
80,millimeters of mercury.
2855.72,So you might hear about a normal
blood,"pressure being about,"
2858.77,"again, this is an"
"approximate,",120 over 80.
2861.81,"What that means is,"
2862.93,at the point where blood was
being,"pumped through there,"
2865.61,"your arteries and veins, boom,"
2867.63,"that it's 120 millimeters of mercury,"
2870.87,"but then, when the heart"
relaxes,for a second
2873.25,"before the next beat, then it drops to 80."
2877.38,"So there's high pressure, low pressure,"
2878.99,"high pressure, low pressure."
2880.28,The fluid is being pumped
through,the system.
2883.21,"Now, why am I telling you all this?"
2884.44,"Well, it turns out, that"
there,are neural circuits
2887.2,that link your visual system
2889.67,and focusing on a particular
point,"with that top number,"
2893.19,the systolic blood pressure.
2894.71,And when you focus your eyes
on,"a particular location,"
2897.621,"that systolic blood pressure goes up,"
2900.35,and there are some other systems
2902.02,that are coordinated with
it,"in your brain and body,"
2904.35,"that start releasing adrenaline,"
2905.917,low amounts of adrenaline in most cases.
2908.72,"And that adrenaline, further"
readies,your body for action.
2912.08,"So, bringing our visual focus"
to,"a particular location,"
2915.718,does a number of things to the brain
2918.07,and the whole system of
the,"body, to prepare it,"
2920.95,to place it into a state of readiness
2923.55,that makes us more likely
to,lean into our goals
2927.18,into action. And if we step
back,"and think about this,"
2929.63,this makes perfect sense.
2931.12,The brain and body need to be coordinated.
2932.66,We can't just think about a goal.
2934.31,"In fact, a deer or a lion,"
can't,just think about a goal.
2937.69,It has to think about a goal
and,then has to feel some sort
2941.98,"of activation energy,"
2943.43,some willingness or desire to move forward
2946.22,in pursuit of that goal.
2947.7,"So imagining a goal, has to be coupled"
2951.52,to the physical pursuit of the goal.
2953.17,"So our visual system in a beautiful way,"
2956.02,"brings together a focus, literally,"
2958.07,a visual focus on a
particular,point outside us.
2961.147,Then it recruits an increase
in,"systolic blood pressure,"
2965.06,"which creates a systemic, a body-wide"
2968.13,and brain-wide increase
in,"fuel utilization,"
2970.85,"in oxygen availability,"
2971.923,in our willingness to
move,"forward as a body,"
2975.13,as a whole coherent system.
2977.02,And then there are also
neurotransmitter,"systems,"
2979.38,"like epinephrine, as we"
will,"soon see dopamine,"
2982.87,that get recruited as well
2984.27,to place us into a
continual,mode of action.
2987.97,This to me is a remarkable
feature,of our physiology
2992.01,and it gets right to the point
2993.63,of some of the psychological phenomenon
2995.67,that we were talking about earlier.
2996.93,Let's just recall what some of those are.
2998.37,"I won't list them all,"
2999.203,"but, a goal has to be"
"significant,",they say.
3002.43,"All the psychologists, all"
the,"popular stuff online says,"
3004.61,"it has to be significant,"
3005.7,has to be inspirational
3007.45,and has to be action oriented.
3009.26,So let's say you look
out,into the landscape
3011.55,"of what's available to you,"
3012.9,"whether or not it's just in your mind,"
3014.27,"or you look at a specific point, you say,"
3016.192,I want to go to that
particular,"restaurant,"
3018.63,to eat that particular food.
3020.05,And you orient towards it
and,you move towards it.
3022.22,"This is the way that your brain and body,"
3023.84,are coordinating their actions together.
3026.547,"Conversely, when our visual system,"
3029.427,is in a mode of looking at everything.
3031.78,When the aperture of our
visual,"system is very broad,"
3035.47,we know that there's also a reduction
3037.87,in our goal directed behavior
3039.27,and a reduction in the
systolic,blood pressure.
3042.3,It's as if our peripersonal
space,"is sufficient,"
3045.84,we don't need to get
beyond,our current state.
3047.92,We're not oriented toward
any,one thing in particular.
3051.24,So I've now described
some,of the psychology
3053.36,and some of the underlying physiology.
3055.47,"Now, I'd like to mesh"
this,within the context
3057.88,of actual specific goal
setting,and goal pursuit.
3061.6,Because what many of you
are,"probably thinking is,"
3063.6,"well, that's some physiology,"
there's,"some psychology,"
3065.41,but how do you actually apply this
3067.35,towards setting and achieving goals?
3069.12,"Well, you do that, by understanding"
that,your mental frame
3073.63,and your attention are
always,"either positioned,"
3076.95,"to your peripersonal space,"
3078.61,focused on your immediate
possessions,"and state,"
3082.19,or towards things outside you.
3083.97,"But then you also have the ability,"
3085.39,to dynamically travel back
and,forth between those.
3087.75,"And so next, we're going to talk about,"
3088.96,what the literature says about
things,"like visualization,"
3092.16,"immediate and intermediate goals,"
3094.39,long-term goals and how
to,best achieve those.
3096.94,And then we're going to move specifically
3098.35,into the protocols that you can use.
3100.1,It's a protocol that I've
specifically,developed
3102.06,"for you, the listeners,"
3103.64,in order to incorporate all
the,"signs into a best practice,"
3107.32,"that you can do any time, any place,"
3108.735,to really identify what
it,"is specifically,"
3110.956,that you want to pursue
3112.87,and the best route to pursue
and,achieve that goal.
3115.49,Focusing our visual attention
on,"one particular point,"
3118.61,is incredibly effective for
all,types of goal pursuit.
3121.78,And if you'd like to read
some,of the scientific studies
3124.02,or read a review of
the,"scientific studies,"
3126.81,"that have looked at how,"
narrowing,"one's visual attention,"
3129.91,can really enhance the
effectiveness,"of pursuing goals,"
3133.6,I'll put a link to this study.
3134.91,"The title of the study is,"
keeping,"the goal in sight,"
3137.85,testing the influence of
narrowed,visual attention
3140.37,on physical activity.
3141.75,And this is a paper from
Emily,"Balcetis's Lab,"
3144.98,"focuses mainly on physical activities,"
3146.81,but it mentioned some
other,things as well.
3148.68,This is an article published in
3150.618,Personality and Social
Psychology,"Bulletin in 2020,"
3153.255,so it's recent.
3154.96,"It's an exceptional paper in my opinion,"
3157.47,really gets to the heart
of,how all this works
3159.437,and some of the examples of
where,it's been implemented.
3161.82,So let's apply this visual
"tool,","in a very simple way,"
3165.09,to any type of goal
that,you want to pursue.
3169.61,If you already know what
goal,"you want to pursue,"
3171.17,"maybe it's a workout,"
3172.05,maybe it's a cognitive work
of,some particular sort.
3174.77,"Again, the process is very simple."
3176.43,You're going to focus your
visual,attention on one point
3179.42,"beyond your peripersonal space,"
3181.28,so it could be on your computer.
It,"could be on the wall,"
3183.453,it could be a horizon.
3184.72,It could be at a distance
3186.07,and you're going to focus
your,visual attention there.
3188.3,And with some effort you're going
to,hold your visual attention
3190.6,"for 30 to 60 seconds, you"
might,"blink, that's okay,"
3194.13,but you're going to try
3194.963,and hold your visual attention there.
3196.1,So no moving your head around.
3197.79,No diverting your attention
to,other locations.
3199.79,Some people will find it very easy to do.
3201.34,Other people will find it quite hard.
3203.07,Your mind may drift
"cognitively,","that's okay,"
3205.7,but try and bring your visual attention
3207.48,to that common point.
3209.54,"Several episodes ago, I talked about how,"
3211.71,there are actually studies
looking,at developing this kind
3213.97,"of training in students, for ADHD"
3216.36,and the data on that are
actually,quite encouraging.
3218.75,So for people who have ADHD
3220.25,"and focus issues and attentional issues,"
3222.49,this can be effective.
3223.37,"For people who don't, this"
can,also be effective.
3226.3,"Again, it places your brain and body"
3228.26,into a state of readiness
3229.46,and then the idea is to move
into,"the particular actions,"
3232.51,that bring you closer to your goal.
3234.28,We haven't yet talked
about,how to set goals
3236.27,and how to assess progress.
3237.47,This is simply how to pursue goals.
3240.57,"But the visual component is important,"
3242.91,"in fact, I would argue"
that,the visual system
3245.79,and harnessing your visual
attention,"to a narrow point,"
3248.33,"is going to be the most effective way,"
3249.891,to get your brain and body
into,"a mode of action,"
3252.74,to pursue whatever goal it
is,you're trying to pursue.
3255.85,That practice is in stark
contrast,"to multitasking,"
3258.78,where by definition
your,attention is moving
3260.96,from place to place to place.
3262.7,I mentioned that
multitasking,can be effective
3264.8,in getting your system into somewhat
3266.67,"of an increased level of activation,"
3269.11,so that you can pursue
a,more focused goal.
3270.9,But the visual attention
to,"a particular point,"
3273.22,is going to be the most effective
way,to bring your system
3275.6,into a state of readiness
and,action for goal pursuit.
3278.21,"There's another really interesting way,"
3279.86,that you can leverage your visual system
3281.395,toward long-term goals.
3284.83,"The Balcetis Lab has also done,"
3286.43,"some really interesting experiments,"
3287.9,looking at people's ability to set
3290.65,and stick to long-term goals.
3292.3,And the long-term goal
that,"they looked at,"
3294.63,was one related to saving
money,for later in life.
3298.63,This is something that a
lot,"of people struggle with,"
3300.42,a lot of people have a
hard,time investing money
3302.45,or saving money for later in life.
3304.13,"Simply because as human beings,"
3306.2,we vary in the extent to which we worry
3308.86,about what's going to happen later.
3310.84,There's also a phenomenon of
"so-called,",delay discounting.
3314.45,"Delay discounting, is the fact that goals,"
3317.21,become less rewarding when
they,exist further out
3320.1,in the future.
3321.32,You may have experienced this
walking,past a donut shop.
3323.49,I love donuts
3324.33,"I'm just going to admit it,"
over,and over again on the spot.
3326.09,I love the smell of them.
I,love the taste of them.
3327.97,I try to eat them
3328.803,'cause I'm told they're
not,that good for me
3330.167,"and indeed, I don't think they are."
3332.33,I occasionally cave and
I'll,eat one or many.
3335.1,"But in general,"
3336.32,I try not to cave to the
immediately,rewarding properties
3340.12,of the smell and the taste of the donut.
3342.89,"But, what we know is"
that,if you smell a donut
3346.52,"or you smell a wonderful piece of food,"
3348.99,"in the immediate term, it"
brings,"your level of focus,"
3351.95,your mental focus to the immediate phase.
3354.6,"And it feels very rewarding,"
3355.96,"like if you had it now,"
it,would just be so good.
3358.62,But if you actually extend
that,reward out to tomorrow
3361.5,"or the next thing you think,"
3362.684,today happens to be a
"Saturday,","that we're recording,"
3365.61,"but, on Tuesday morning,"
I'm,going to get a donut.
3368.5,It doesn't have the same value
because,"the reward system,"
3371.81,doesn't work as well for long-term goals.
3375.68,It's not as salient.
3377.22,"It's not as tangible, a goal,"
3378.98,especially for something like a donut.
3380.6,"Whereas the kinds of goals that work,"
3382.55,when you place them out to the longer term
3384.36,and can create a heightened
sense,"of motivation,"
3386.42,tend to be things that are
much,more rewarding to us.
3388.64,"So delay discounting simply says that,"
3390.36,the further out in time
that,"a given goal is,"
3392.93,the less effective that reward will be
3395.42,in motivating one's behavior.
3397.01,And indeed you see this with
saving,"money for retirement,"
3399.75,you see this with all sorts
of,"long-term investment,"
3403.54,"The Balcetis Lab, therefore"
did,"an experiment,"
3406.17,where they looked at people's tendency
3408.714,to save money for later in life.
3412.22,But the groups that they
created,"in this study,"
3414.79,were really interesting.
3415.623,"They had one group,"
3416.46,"imagine, what it would be like"
to,be 30 or 40 years older.
3420.766,And then to invest a
certain,"amount of money,"
3423.88,according to whatever it is they thought
3425.64,that they would need.
3426.473,And they measured the amount
3427.45,that they had set aside and saved
3429.24,for later in life.
3432.0,"The other group, actually"
viewed,"photos of themselves,"
3435.55,"so picture, images of themselves"
3437.52,"that were artificially, digitally aged,"
3440.93,so that they could see
themselves,30 or 40 years
3443.58,into the future.
3445.06,And it turns out
3445.893,"that people in that second group,"
3447.57,simply by perceiving their
own,"image, in the future,"
3452.47,invested far more money into later life.
3455.95,They set aside more money.
3457.01,Somehow it bridged the gap
3458.5,between their immediate experience of life
3460.53,and the longer arc
3462.68,toward what it was going to
be,like in 30 or 40 years.
3465.66,"So very powerful result in my opinion,"
3467.7,"because what it says again,"
3469.19,is that our visual
perception,of the future
3471.93,"or our visual perception of the present,"
3474.52,is what allows us to anchor
our,goal directed systems
3477.52,and our motivation to take on things
3480.343,that in the immediate term
might,not seem that useful.
3483.23,"So, you can imagine all"
sorts,of variations on this.
3486.5,You can imagine that
every,"time I want a donut,"
3489.7,I'd see a vision of myself
3491.38,or an actual physical picture of myself
3493.415,as a consequence of having
eaten,many donuts every day
3497.07,for the next 10 years.
3498.229,I don't know what that
image,would look like
3499.24,'cause I've never seen it.
3501.24,That's not an experiment
3502.2,that I necessarily need to do
3503.491,because I'm not that
motivated,"to eat donuts,"
3505.62,"but I have to confess, I am somebody"
3507.84,who I think I'm pretty
good,at managing resources.
3511.37,But I think if I were to see
an,"image of myself at 70 or 75,"
3515.51,there's so many things
3516.343,that are associated with visual images.
3517.67,"Like what our body must feel like,"
3519.44,what our needs are
probably,going to be like
3521.73,in that state or in that age.
3523.96,What sorts of things we may
3525.18,or may not still be
able,to do at that age.
3527.81,And that anchors back
3529.12,"to immediate goal-directed behaviors,"
3530.83,such as setting aside
money,for retirement.
3532.86,Such as investing in
one's,health practices.
3536.419,And indeed there's a study
3537.252,that has looked at how people will invest
3539.16,in exercise and healthy eating.
3542.04,If they just think about the future
3544.27,and what they might be like in the future
3546.74,versus seeing images of
themselves,"in the future,"
3549.61,if they were to go down a
healthy,or unhealthy route.
3552.46,"So again, the point is"
3553.69,"that the visual system, what we see,"
3556.58,is principally important
3558.79,in defining what we do
in,the immediate term.
3560.93,Even if what we see relates to something
3562.56,in the far off distance.
3564.61,I think these are phenomenal studies
3566.12,and they get right down
to,an important issue
3568.33,that's been kicked around
3569.27,over and over in the literature
3571.38,"and in the discussion about goal seeking,"
3572.86,which is visualization.
3574.47,"We here keep the big goal in mind,"
3576.84,focus on the big goal.
3578.43,"So now we're going to address,"
3579.71,what does the science say
3580.8,about visualizing big goals?
3583.53,If you're somebody who's
interested,"in business,"
3585.36,or let's say you're
focused,"on relationship,"
3587.55,is thinking about the perfect relationship
3589.9,and what that would look like
3590.99,and the family that you would have
3592.73,and where you would live.
3593.64,Is that effective in generating the kinds
3595.97,of behaviors that will lead you to that?
3597.51,Is it effective to think
3598.67,about the big win at the end?
3600.77,"Well, it turns out it is,"
3602.65,"but you have to be very, very careful"
3604.29,with when and how you
implement,that visualization.
3607.06,"'Cause if you do it correctly,"
3608.64,it can really serve
your,goal seeking well.
3610.71,"And if you do it incorrectly,"
3612.18,it can undermine the entire process.
3614.57,"So, does visualization work?"
3617.09,"Well, turns out,"
3618.53,that visualization of the
big,"win, the end goal."
3622.01,So the Superbowl win
3623.523,or eight gold medals in the Olympics
3626.52,or graduation from the
university,of your choice
3630.06,or making a certain amount of money
3631.44,or finding the partner of
your,"choice, et cetera."
3634.75,That visualization is effective
3637.12,in getting the goal
pursuit,"process started,"
3640.4,but it actually is a pretty lousy
3642.72,and maybe even counterproductive way
3644.81,of maintaining pursuit of that goal.
3648.08,Meaning continuing to
engage,the sort of actions
3651.33,that are going to get you to
eventually,achieve that goal.
3654.22,I think this is going to be
surprising,"to people, at first,"
3657.47,but if we think back to our discussion
3660.17,about the physiology of
the,"blood pressure system,"
3663.18,it'll make sense.
3667.04,Good scientific studies have been done
3668.727,"where people are told to imagine,"
3671.84,or even script out
3673.2,their long-term vision
and,goal for themselves.
3675.48,What is the big goal?
3676.857,"And they're talked to,"
3678.28,or told to imagine it with
a,rich amount of detail.
3681.3,To think about how it's going to feel
3682.53,in their body and the big win.
3684.2,"And basically what happens is,"
3685.91,if you measure people's blood pressure
3687.27,"or other metrics of physiology,"
3689.02,you see an increase in that
systolic,blood pressure.
3691.39,There's an kind of a
ramping,up of the readiness
3694.235,"and excitement for that goal,"
3696.94,but that increase in blood
pressure,quickly wanes.
3700.14,"And over time,"
3701.58,"that visual of the long-term goal,"
3703.82,becomes a poor thing
3705.73,to rely on in order to
generate,the actions
3709.369,that are required to reach that goal.
3712.12,"In fact, there's a much better way"
3714.28,to maintain ongoing action toward a goal
3717.73,"that also involves visualization,"
3720.15,but it turns out it's not
about,visualizing success.
3723.56,It's about visualizing failure.
3725.7,The Balcetis Lab and other labs
3728.05,have looked at whether or
not,people make progress
3730.85,toward goals of different types.
3733.27,Whether or not they're
thinking,about the goal.
3736.06,They're thinking about that goal line
3737.38,"and what they want to achieve,"
3738.77,that long-term goal
3739.78,and all the wonderful
things,"associated with it,"
3741.96,or whether or not they're thinking
3743.27,about all the ways in
which,"they could fail,"
3745.113,en route to that goal.
3747.302,This is not typically what
we,are encouraged to do.
3750.63,"Typically, we are told"
don't,"imagine failure,"
3752.9,"push failure out of your mind,"
3754.32,only focus on success.
3756.23,"Fake it till you make it,"
3757.34,or is a phrase that I
absolutely,"hate, frankly,"
3759.65,because it's not even
clear,what that means.
3761.46,And it's not even clear
3762.49,what the ethical form of that is.
3764.17,I think it means continue
despite,any anxiety
3766.99,or fear that things won't work out.
3768.72,"But if you look at the literature,"
3770.59,"the scientific literature,"
3772.26,what the Balcetis Lab and
other,"labs have shown,"
3774.21,is that there's a near
"doubling,",near doubling
3777.76,"in the probability of reaching one's goal,"
3780.83,if you focus routinely
on,foreshadowing failure.
3786.35,You think about the ways
in,"which things could fail,"
3789.25,if you take action A or you take action B
3792.31,"and instead, therefore, you take action C."
3794.5,You're supposed to think
3795.333,"about how things could fail,"
3796.81,"if you don't get up and run each morning,"
3799.04,"if your goal is, say a fitness goal."
3800.74,"So let's use that as an example,"
3802.5,"because even though I realized,"
3804.03,people are in pursuit of many
"things,",not just fitness.
3805.869,Fitness goals and physical
goals,are a very concrete thing
3809.43,that we can all get on the same page about
3811.8,'cause they're related to actions.
3813.89,"Let's say, somebody sets a goal"
3816.61,"of running five miles,"
four,"times a week, minimum,"
3820.32,"and as many as seven,"
four,"times a week, minimum"
3822.31,before 8:00 AM.
3823.66,"In a previous podcast on habits,"
3825.1,I talked about the benefits
3826.41,of not necessarily setting specific times
3828.282,"that one will do things,"
3829.39,but setting time blocks
3830.69,that one we'll do things.
3831.523,"So you say before 8:00 AM,"
3832.51,you're going to run five miles
3834.33,and that's going to happen
up,to seven days a week.
3838.46,"One version of this would be,"
3839.71,"okay, sit back in a chair"
3840.95,and think about how great
you're,"going to feel and look,"
3843.77,if you're doing this every day.
3844.83,How your health is going to improve.
3846.33,"How everything's going to be,"
3847.163,"your blood markers, of lipids, et cetera,"
3848.83,"are going to improve, okay, fine."
3850.46,That's the visualization goal
3852.359,of visualizing the end point.
3854.87,It turns out that is far less effective
3856.79,"and maybe even counterproductive,"
3858.49,compared to thinking about
what's,"going to happen,"
3860.99,if you don't do this.
3862.76,The negative health outcomes
that,"are going to occur,"
3865.06,the disappointment you're
going,to have in yourself.
3867.01,The fact that you're
going,"to wait until 7.30,"
3869.41,that's not long enough
3870.33,for many people to run five miles.
3872.17,You got to put on your shoes
as,there could be pouring rain
3874.965,"or even hailing or snowing, outside."
3875.798,And now you're not going
outside,unless you're somebody
3877.56,who's particularly motivated to do that.
3880.3,"So, foreshadowing failure turns out"
3882.87,to be the best way to
motivate,toward goal pursuit.
3885.47,"In fact, as I mentioned before,"
3886.92,there's a near doubling in the likelihood
3888.67,that people will reach goals of any kind.
3890.72,When they're constantly thinking
3891.89,about how bad it's going
to,"be, if they fail."
3894.5,If we think back to the
neural,circuit associated
3897.72,"with assessing value in our goal pursuits,"
3901.09,this makes perfect sense.
3902.1,"The amygdala, that center of the brain"
3903.83,that's involved in anxiety
and,fear and worry.
3906.33,"Well, the amygdala, is one"
of,the four core components
3909.4,of our goal setting and
goal,pursuit circuitry.
3912.58,And there's no bypassing that.
3914.13,there is no one listening to this
3915.75,or watching this who's
amygdala,is not involved
3918.5,in their goal setting and
goal,pursuit behavior.
3921.24,"And so, while I'd love"
to,be able to tell you
3923.06,that all you should think
about,is rainbows and puppies
3925.88,"and all the wonderful, rewarding things"
3927.343,that are going to happen
when,you achieve your goals.
3930.43,"The truth is, you should"
be,thinking mainly
3932.76,"about how bad it's really going to get,"
3935.2,if you don't do it.
3936.033,"How disappointed in yourself,"
you're,going to feel.
3937.87,"How it will negatively impact you,"
3940.45,if not in the immediate
"term,","in the long-term,"
3942.56,if indeed your goal is to reach your goal.
3945.03,"So, I want to emphasize"
3947.21,that I'm not interested
in,encouraging people
3949.41,to flagellate themselves.
3950.58,I'm encouraging people
to,achieve their goals.
3954.31,"And it turns out the best way to do that,"
3955.81,is by foreshadowing failure.
3957.56,And the more specific you can get
3960.01,by writing down or thinking about
3961.47,"or talking about,"
3962.53,how bad it will be if you
don't,"achieve your goals,"
3964.81,the more likely you are
to,achieve those goals.
3967.77,Part of the reason for that
3969.432,almost certainly has to do with increases
3971.82,in systolic blood pressure
3973.13,"and increases in readiness in your system,"
3975.73,when you imagine failure.
3976.95,The brain and body are much better
3979.94,at moving away from fearful things
3982.09,than towards things we want.
3983.4,I wish I could tell you
that,"wasn't the case,"
3984.94,but there is a true asymmetry
3986.71,in the way we are built.
3987.96,"In fact, the brain and body can engage"
3990.3,"in what's called, one trial learning."
3991.68,"When something bad happens,"
3992.96,we eat a food that makes us sick.
3994.27,We have an interaction
with,a person or place
3996.06,that we really don't like.
3997.46,It only takes one trial to really...
3999.38,"One event, one time to reorient"
4002.47,"or rewire our neural circuitry,"
4003.84,so that we have a bias toward moving away
4005.41,from that thing in the future.
4006.81,"When things go well, unfortunately,"
4009.3,that doesn't often occur.
4010.34,"If things go really, really well,"
4011.85,it might orient our brain and body
4013.26,toward wanting more of that thing.
4014.54,And we'll have neural circuitry changes
4016.21,that will lead us to engage
4017.52,in that particular behavior
or,"interaction again,"
4020.15,but it is never as effective
4021.575,as these avoidance circuits.
4024.33,"So again, foreshadow failure,"
4026.01,if you're going to
visualize,"in a positive way,"
4028.47,do that at the very beginning
of,some goal pursuit.
4030.64,Maybe intermittently
every,"once in a while,"
4032.44,you imagine the big win
4033.99,of scoring perfect on exam
4035.96,or winning the championship
or,the great relationship.
4038.12,"But most of the time,"
4039.37,"if you want to be effective,"
4040.44,you should be focusing on avoiding failure
4042.53,and you should be really clear
4043.51,about what those failures would look like
4045.05,and feel like.
4045.91,"Now, let's talk about goal setting."
4048.21,"Going back to that prominent literature,"
4050.12,"the psychology and popular literature,"
4051.75,"again, we can hear some of"
these,themes start to emerge.
4055.319,The goal should be
"significant,",we are told.
4058.67,It should be inspirational.
4060.55,"It should be aggressive, yet realistic."
4063.28,"Well, okay, that's all fine and good,"
4065.63,but let's get semi
quantitative,about this.
4067.96,Let's at least get biological about this.
4070.28,How inspirational does it need to be?
4071.833,Does it need to be the kind of thing
4073.13,that is so inspiring to me
4074.84,that I can't sleep at all?
4075.85,"Well, that wouldn't be good"
4076.683,"because as I believe and I know,"
4079.16,many of you have heard me
say,"many, many times before,"
4081.51,"regular deep sleep, 80%"
or,more of the nights
4084.61,"that you go to sleep,"
4085.443,is going to be crucial to your cognitive
4086.67,and mental functioning and your ability
4088.01,to achieve your goals in the long-term.
4089.77,That's absolutely clear.
4091.15,"So, it's got to be,"
inspirational,"and exciting,"
4093.69,but what does that really look like
4095.24,and what does that correspond to
4096.69,and how do we actually make that happen?
4098.82,"Well, once again, there is a mismatch"
4101.65,between what the real data show
4103.28,and what we're most often told.
4105.94,"Turns out, that again,"
work,"in Balcetis Lab,"
4109.66,"but also other laboratories,"
4110.96,has addressed whether
or,not the probability
4114.298,"of achieving a goal, goes up or down,"
4118.78,depending on whether or not one visualizes
4121.61,"or sets a goal that is easy,"
moderate,or impossible.
4127.62,An impossible goal would
"be,","for instance, if I say,"
4130.41,"I'm going to jump from my front driveway,"
4133.202,"all the way up to the road,"
4135.21,"the road's, quite a distance away,"
4136.6,it's more than 20 meters away.
4137.66,It's just not going to happen.
4138.6,"It's not going to happen in this lifetime,"
4139.68,it's not going to happen
in,any other lifetime.
4141.67,Not unless it involves
some,elaborate technology
4144.24,"that I'm not aware of,"
4145.27,a jet pack or something like that.
4146.4,It's just not going to happen.
4147.857,An easy goal would be
something,"like, can you jump?"
4151.16,"Or could I jump, two feet in"
front,"of me, obviously, yes."
4153.89,"Now I'm using a trivial example here,"
4155.5,but this could be translated
to,"any kind of goal,"
4157.54,"school goal, physical goal, et cetera."
4161.15,"It turns out that,"
4162.24,"when people set goals,"
4163.84,"whether or not they are nutritional goals,"
4165.965,eat more of this or eat less of that.
4168.16,"Whether or not they're fitness goals,"
4169.81,"run more, lift more."
4171.032,"Some other goals, swim less, swim more,"
4173.062,whatever it is their goal happens to be.
4175.48,"Some learning goal,"
4176.59,"some relationship goal,"
4178.5,some attempt to modify their behavior.
4181.01,"It turns out that if the goal is too easy,"
4183.61,"it's too within reach,"
4185.34,it doesn't recruit enough
4187.6,of the autonomic nervous system
4189.3,"to make pursuit of that goal, likely."
4192.96,"Now that might be surprising,"
4194.21,at least it was surprising
to,"me, you think,"
4195.76,"well, something is really, really easy."
4197.243,there's a very low bar to achieve it.
4199.94,People are probably more likely to do it.
4201.69,"But turns out that's not the case,"
4202.97,when we hear that a goal
needs,"to be inspirational,"
4205.03,what do we mean?
4205.95,"When we hear that something's too easy,"
4207.3,"to recruit our action, what do we mean?"
4208.93,"Well, Balcetis Lab measured,"
systolic,"blood pressure,"
4212.31,"and found that,"
4213.143,when goals were too easy
for,"people to attain,"
4216.0,they didn't get that increase
in,systolic blood pressure
4218.24,and recruitment of the other
neural,"and vascular systems,"
4220.71,meaning the blood systems
and,the nervous system
4222.74,that would place them into ongoing effort.
4224.62,And so they quickly gave up.
4227.19,"Also, if a goal was too lofty,"
4229.91,if it was too far from
their,"current abilities,"
4232.409,it didn't recruit enough
systolic,blood pressure.
4236.26,Even if people could get very excited
4238.41,"about something mentally,"
4239.82,it simply didn't place their
body,into a state of readiness
4242.89,because it wasn't tangible
4244.44,that they could actually
perhaps,really achieve it.
4247.58,So it turns out that
when,"goals were moderate,"
4251.1,when they were just outside
of,one's immediate abilities
4254.24,"or that one felt that yeah,"
4255.48,that would take a lot of effort.
4257.13,"But it's within range or maybe in range,"
4260.129,"like maybe I can do it, maybe I can't."
4263.02,Then there was a near doubling
4265.97,of the systolic blood
pressure,in the good sense.
4268.27,It didn't go into the unhealthy range
4270.28,and a doubling or more of the likelihood
4273.69,that they would engage
in,the ongoing pursuit
4277.04,of that particular goal.
4278.44,"So here we're talking about goal setting.,"
4279.8,"what we're saying is, set"
goals,"that are realistic,"
4283.03,but that aren't so
"realistic,",that they're easy.
4286.51,The goals need to be realistic
and,truly challenging.
4289.93,Don't set goals that are
so,challenging and so lofty
4293.14,that they crash that blood pressure system
4296.52,in the other direction and make you
4298.5,or anyone feel unmotivated.
4300.29,"In hearing this, it makes sense,"
4301.64,but I don't think I
would,"have predicted it,"
4303.17,had they not done this
very,controlled study.
4305.76,"I would have thought,"
4306.69,"the loftier the goal, the bigger the goal,"
4308.87,the more that it recruits
the,autonomic system
4311.33,"and the more that people are likely,"
4312.68,to lean into the energy
4314.23,and effort to pursue and attain that goal.
4317.06,I also would have thought
4318.1,"that if a goal is really easy to achieve,"
4320.78,that it would engage the systems
4322.531,of action in the brain and body enough
4325.18,that people would sort of get into motion
4326.8,and pursue that goal.
4327.633,But neither is the case.
4328.57,"Again, set goals that"
are,"difficult to achieve,"
4332.394,"but that are not so lofty,"
4334.476,that they collapse your system
4337.22,and that you feel overwhelmed.
4338.5,"And the important thing here,"
4339.83,"is that how we perceive a goal,"
4342.25,whether or not we think
it's,"within reach or not,"
4344.36,"of course will vary,"
4345.41,depending on whether or not we are rested.
4347.3,Depending on whether or not other aspects
4348.92,of our life are going well.
4350.34,"I mean, we can think that"
we,are hot on the heels
4353.04,of a lifetime goal and
everything's,"going well,"
4356.527,and then there'll be some
crisis,"interpersonal crisis,"
4359.34,or there'll be a health crisis
and,you'll be shut down.
4361.59,And then that goal seems
"very,",very hard to attain.
4364.17,So we will talk about how to update goals
4366.6,under different context in a few minutes.
4368.54,"But, of course this is"
going,"to be an averaging,"
4370.79,this isn't something
that,you do just once.
4372.7,"But the takeaway again is very simple,"
4374.33,set goals that are
moderately,"hard to hard,"
4377.03,but not so hard nor so easy
4379.49,that they don't engage your
brain,and body properly.
4382.41,"Moderate goals are best,"
4384.25,if you want to achieve your goals.
4386.25,Now I'd like to talk about
three,particular areas
4388.44,"of scientific study,"
4389.99,"that point to goal pursuit,"
4392.24,goal assessment and goal achievement.
4396.09,"Previously I told you,"
4397.67,that it's great to foreshadow failure.
4400.57,That that's a great way to get your system
4402.15,into a state of activation.
4403.47,I also told you
4404.71,"that you want to set goals,"
4406.09,that are challenging but possible.
4407.57,"And again, here, I'm paraphrasing"
4409.21,from the work of Emily Balcetis.
4410.71,I want to be very clear.
4412.798,There are a few other
things,that one can do
4415.66,"in order to bias the likelihood,"
4418.09,that you will succeed in
trying,to achieve your goals.
4421.15,"First of all, limit your options,"
4424.55,"trying to pursue too many goals at once,"
4426.82,can definitely be counter productive.
4428.42,Now I realized that life is complicated.
4430.82,We all have multiple goals
that,"we're trying to pursue,"
4433.27,but if we have particular
goals,"that are important to us,"
4436.23,we have to be careful to not
get,distracted by other goals.
4439.34,And many people run into this problem.
4441.1,So setting one or two
4443.3,or maybe three major
goals,"for a given year,"
4446.45,is going to be more than
enough,for most people
4448.73,and is actually going to be
challenging,for most people.
4451.11,"Now, of course we have daily"
goals,and monthly goals
4453.01,"and yearly goals, but if"
we,"have big lofty goals,"
4455.87,we need to be careful not to
contaminate,our mental space
4458.7,and our visual space with too many goals.
4460.59,"And why do I say visual goals? Well,"
4463.234,what various department stores
4465.67,"and supermarkets have discovered is that,"
4468.51,"the greater, the number of"
things,"in our visual attention,"
4472.75,the more that we can draw our attention
4475.54,and our goals off a line of pursuit.
4477.69,What does that mean?
4478.79,"Well, let's think about it"
in,the practical context.
4480.66,This has actually been done.
4482.23,Big department stores have figured out
4484.03,that if they stock their
"shelves,",chock-a-block
4486.5,"with many, many options of food"
4489.06,or clothing items or objects
or,"anything like that,"
4491.99,people simply buy more stuff.
4494.92,People are very prone to
orienting,their attention
4498.71,to whatever's in front of them.
4499.82,"You put a lot of stuff in front of them,"
4501.02,"their attention drifts,"
4501.86,"you put fewer things in front of them,"
4504.603,their attention is more narrow.
4505.96,"In a later episode, we'll talk"
about,"designing a workspace,"
4509.04,that's optimized on the basis of this.
4511.06,It doesn't mean being in a room
4512.31,with nothing except just
your,desk and a computer.
4514.8,"Doesn't have to be that sparse,"
4516.97,"but visual sparseness,"
4518.99,actually can help us orient
our,focus and our behavior.
4523.13,When we have a lot of things
in,"our visual environment,"
4525.13,or a lot of things in our
cognitive,environment.
4527.15,It's the same thing.
4528.36,And so if you're going to try
and,"pursue a fitness goal,"
4530.96,"a relationship goal, an academic goal,"
4532.95,and a longterm life
financial,"goal all at once,"
4535.33,that's four things.
4536.49,And you're going to have
to,come up with systems
4538.18,that allow you to isolate those
goals,in a very rigid way.
4542.56,And if you do have
multiple,interleaving goals
4545.07,and overlapping goals
and,"simultaneous goals,"
4547.85,"in a few minutes, we're going to talk"
4548.97,about a process that will allow you
4550.43,"to use your visual system,"
4552.12,to align towards each of
those,"goals, sequentially,"
4555.04,in a way that makes it much more likely
4556.86,that you'll achieve them.
4557.99,So now let's talk about
specificity,of goals.
4561.2,We've all heard that the
more,"specific a goal is,"
4563.73,and the more specific we are
4565.08,about when and how we are
going,"to execute that goal,"
4568.243,the higher probability
4569.62,that we will actually achieve that goal.
4572.36,"And indeed that's the case,"
4573.46,"but there's an additional feature,"
4575.01,that's not often discussed.
4576.77,That is vitally important.
4578.27,"And in fact, maybe more important"
4580.43,than having a specific time of day
4583.25,or a specific end point in mind.
4586.04,"There's a really nice study,"
4586.873,that was done looking at recycling.
4589.46,"This is something that a number of groups,"
4591.56,"businesses, households,"
4592.66,and individuals are trying to do more of.
4594.73,They're trying to lower carbon footprint
4596.24,or contribute to the
world,in some general way
4599.46,by throwing away fewer things
4601.81,that could potentially be recycled.
4604.87,So this has been studied
4605.9,"in the context of the work environment,"
4608.14,where a business decides
and,"lets everybody know,"
4612.035,that there's going to be a greater effort
4614.65,toward recycling cans or bottles
4617.03,"or bottles and cans, et cetera."
4618.74,"And then, the way these studies were done,"
4621.758,is that the janitorial staff
was,swapped out temporarily
4624.98,for researchers that actually measured
4626.78,the number of recyclable items
4629.19,that showed up in the trash
4631.142,"and not in the recycle,"
4633.31,as a function of the
total,amount of trash.
4634.82,"Why'd I say, as a function"
of,the total amount of trash?
4636.38,What's a way of controlling
4637.35,for differences in beverage consumption
4639.57,from one week to the next?
4640.49,"Anyway, the point is they were able"
4642.64,"to very carefully measure,"
4644.311,how much people are recycling
4646.507,before and after this call
to,action to recycle more.
4651.017,"And what they found was,"
4652.99,"if they said, we are going"
to,"try and recycle more,"
4655.5,try not to put cans and
bottles,in the trash.
4658.22,There of course was an
improvement,"in recycling,"
4661.41,but it was pretty modest.
4663.29,Whereas when there was
a,very concrete plan
4666.62,and everyone knew what
that,"concrete plan was,"
4668.77,"for instance, to place all bottles"
4670.88,"and cans into the recycle, not the trash"
4673.37,"or to limit the amount of trash by 50%,"
4677.85,or to eliminate all recyclable
items,from the trash.
4681.21,"So when they made it very concrete,"
4682.95,"exactly what the action steps were,"
4685.9,"there was a remarkable,"
4687.49,"I mean, close to a hundred fold"
4688.97,or more improvement in recycling behavior
4692.69,that lasted many months
4694.87,after this call to action was made.
4697.66,The takeaway from this
is,quite straightforward.
4699.5,It means that having a
concrete,plan is essential.
4702.77,"You can't just say,"
4703.8,I'm going to become a better recycler
4705.23,or I'm going to do things
4706.17,that are better for the environment
4707.31,or I'm going to become
more,physically fit.
4709.67,It has to be a specific
set,of action steps
4712.99,that get right down to details
4715.15,about what success would look like.
4717.81,I've heard this before described
4719.09,as what does right look like?
4720.88,What is the actual outcome
4722.51,that one would like to achieve
4724.07,in terms of action steps?
4725.76,"So not necessarily feeling states,"
4727.52,it wasn't that they all
sat,"around and said,"
4728.89,how great we're all going to feel
4729.82,about ourselves in the world
4731.33,when we accomplish this goal?
4732.52,It was very concrete
"statements,",very concrete plans
4736.36,about action steps that would
deliver,one to one's goal.
4739.57,"Somewhat straightforward and intuitive,"
4741.57,but nonetheless worthwhile.
4743.33,"What it suggests is that for all of us,"
4745.85,if we have certain goals
that,"we want to achieve,"
4748.06,we need to be exquisitely detailed
4750.87,"about what the action steps are,"
4752.69,that we are going to take
4753.6,and to constantly update
those,"action steps,"
4755.93,so that we have a higher probability
4757.45,of meeting those action steps.
4759.23,"Some of you may be asking,"
4760.5,how often should one assess progress?
4763.715,"Well, that of course will"
depend,on the given goal
4766.36,that you're trying to pursue.
4767.69,But in the studies
4768.84,"that I've been referring to here,"
4770.379,the assessment of progress
4772.52,and the updating of concrete
plans,was done weekly.
4775.92,So it seems like weekly
is,"a good starting place,"
4778.81,to address how well one performed
4781.15,in the previous week.
4782.12,And then based on that performance
4784.0,to update the action plan
for,the upcoming week.
4786.73,So weekly seems like a
good,solid rule of thumb
4789.94,for setting particular action goals
4791.935,and assessing one's progress
4794.75,towards the immediate
and,longer term goals.
4797.42,Any discussion about
goals,"and goal pursuit,"
4800.4,would be incomplete without a discussion
4802.37,"about the molecule, dopamine."
4805.2,Dopamine is often thought of
4806.69,"as the molecule of pleasure and reward,"
4809.04,but actually it is the
molecule,of motivation.
4812.6,This is best illustrated
4813.799,"by a classic set of studies,"
4815.61,that have been carried out in
both,animals and in humans.
4818.68,The animal study can be
described,"the following way,"
4822.11,"two rats, each in a separate cage."
4824.6,You can provide those rats
4825.76,with the opportunity to indulge
4827.79,"in something that they like,"
4829.27,like food or mating.
4830.992,"Or heat, if it's cold in the environment,"
4834.3,"or a cool spot in the cage,"
4836.332,if it's warm in the
environment,and so forth.
4839.03,"And what you find is that,"
4840.674,rats will very readily
approach,the rewarding thing.
4846.2,"They will, mate."
4847.15,They will eat.
4847.983,They will pursue something
that,is of pleasure.
4851.93,"Now, if you are to take one of those rats"
4854.32,"and deplete its dopamine neurons,"
4856.24,you can eliminate it's dopamine neurons
4857.83,or block dopamine in the brain.
4860.0,"What you find,"
4860.833,is that those animals
will,still enjoy pleasure.
4865.75,"They will consume the food,"
they,"will mate, et cetera."
4868.61,"However, their motivation,"
4870.8,to achieve pleasure is vastly reduced.
4874.75,"In fact, if you place"
the,"item of pleasure,"
4877.28,"the mate, the food, et cetera,"
4879.37,even just one rat's
length,"away from that rat,"
4882.64,the rat without dopamine
will,not even move one length
4885.75,of its own body in order
to,achieve that pleasure.
4889.07,And there are naturally
occurring,experiments
4890.75,in humans that mimic that
"result,",very accurately.
4894.97,There are certain conditions in humans
4896.25,where there's a depletion of dopamine.
4897.85,"And what you find is that,"
4899.56,the depletion of dopamine
does,not inhibit an ability
4902.77,"to experience pleasure, necessarily."
4905.15,It inhibits an ability to pursue
4907.49,or go through the series of action steps
4909.93,in order to achieve pleasure.
4912.11,"So dopamine, really sits"
4913.51,"at the heart of our motivational state,"
4916.44,to seek out goals and to seek pleasure.
4919.13,And this is true for immediate goals
4921.28,that take place within
a,timeframe of minutes
4923.936,"or a timeframe of a day,"
4925.7,or the timeframe of a week or
the,timeframe of a lifetime.
4929.05,"Dopamine, is the common currency"
by,which we pursue goals.
4933.01,"Now, dopamine does a number of things"
4935.14,that are very interesting.
4936.65,I'm going to describe a few of them
4937.97,as they relate to goal seeking behavior.
4940.78,"First of all, there's"
a,fundamental feature
4943.6,of how our brain releases
and,"uses dopamine,"
4947.72,"that's called, reward prediction error."
4949.67,And the simplest way to think
4950.87,"about dopamine reward prediction error,"
4953.21,is that dopamine is released
in,the greatest amount
4956.8,and places us into a
greater,"state of motivation,"
4960.47,when something happens
that's,positive and novel.
4964.67,"Now, an important thing to"
understand,"about dopamine,"
4966.88,is that it's not always released
4969.35,on the same schedule.
4971.56,There are a couple of different ways
4972.5,that dopamine is released.
4973.62,And when it is released
relative,to your anticipation
4977.68,"of a reward, is key."
4980.37,If you don't expect
something,"positive to happen,"
4983.04,you're just going about your day
4984.26,"and something positive happens,"
4985.95,dopamine and a lot of
dopamine,is released.
4989.43,I had this happen recently.
4991.6,I had no idea
4992.433,that I was going to be
receiving,"something in the mail,"
4994.46,but I went to the mail.
4996.12,I looked in the mail and I
got,something very positive.
4998.77,"And I was really, really"
excited,about this.
5000.083,This is a real event that
"happened,",just today.
5003.12,"However, if we anticipate"
something,positive
5006.93,is going to happen
5008.26,"and then that thing happens,"
5011.0,we experience dopamine as
part,of the anticipation.
5014.36,"So even before we get the reward,"
5016.5,there's an increase in dopamine.
5018.33,"It's not as high as it would be,"
5020.18,if something really novel and unexpected
5022.84,"and positive happened,"
5023.82,but we do get an increase in dopamine.
5025.48,"And then, when we actually"
experience,"the reward,"
5029.38,"we experience the positive thing,"
5031.14,there's a smaller increase in dopamine.
5033.4,"So again, the biggest increases"
in,dopamine are response
5036.01,to things that are
positive,and unexpected.
5040.52,Lesser dopamine is released
5041.93,when we anticipate
something,good will happen
5044.88,"and when that happens,"
"yes,",we get some dopamine.
5047.31,And we also get some dopamine
5048.59,"when the positive thing happens,"
5049.76,think about anticipating
a,great meal with friends.
5052.06,"We have some dopamine churning,"
our,"friends come over,"
5054.41,then we have the meal
5055.45,"and we also get some dopamine from that,"
5056.96,"but not nearly as much as we would,"
5059.22,if it had all happened as
a,part of a big surprise.
5062.51,"Then, there's also the"
case,in which we predict
5064.95,"that something good will happen,"
5067.15,"when that happens, there's"
an,increase in dopamine just
5069.25,"as it was before,"
5070.67,"but then if that thing doesn't happen,"
5072.24,"for instance, our friends"
don't,"show up for dinner,"
5074.34,then there's a drop in dopamine
below,our initial baseline.
5078.43,"That drop in dopamine,"
5079.48,is the chemical essence of
what,"we call, disappointment."
5083.65,"Now, this dopamine reward"
prediction,"error, as it's called,"
5087.7,can be leveraged toward
trying,to reach our goals
5090.96,because it tells us
5092.61,where we should set our milestones.
5095.145,We can't be in a mode
of,simply being focused
5098.71,on the finish line.
5100.28,Very few people can do that
5103.08,over long periods of time
5104.37,in a way that's effective.
5105.203,"Now, earlier I talked about a study"
5106.81,where people were focused
on,"a finish line visually,"
5109.14,and they were moving through space
5110.43,"with these ankle weights on,"
5111.58,but that was a very short-term goal.
5113.81,"So, if a goal is within minutes,"
5116.32,or maybe even within an hour
5117.53,or as in with our immediate
visuals,"environment,"
5120.41,maybe we can do that.
5121.65,But most goals of the sort
5123.16,that most people are
"pursuing,","fitness goals,"
5125.1,"academic goals, business goals,"
5126.35,"relationship goals, et cetera,"
involve,some milestones.
5129.98,"So, understanding what we know"
5132.01,"about reward prediction error,"
we,can make better choices
5135.87,"about where to place the milestones,"
5137.97,how far out in the future
to,place milestones.
5141.22,"So then the question becomes,"
5142.48,how often or at what intervals
should,one assess progress?
5147.3,"And it turns out this is very subjective,"
5149.14,but that there's a way
to,make it objective.
5151.81,"Now, in a previous episode of"
the,"""Huberman Lab Podcast"","
5156.31,I had a discussion with
the,great Robert Sapolsky
5158.717,"and we were talking about,"
5160.47,how the brain can subjectively change
5163.13,whether or not a given
behavior,"or experience,"
5165.35,is positive or negative.
5166.55,"And the example that Robert gave,"
5169.44,is a really phenomenal one.
5170.44,It's a study that's been done in rats
5172.3,and also in humans
5173.17,where they took a rat
5174.29,and they had a rat run on a running wheel.
5177.051,Rats turns out like to
run,them running wheels
5178.76,"and the blood pressure of that animal,"
5180.89,"the health metrics for that animal,"
5182.51,"the lipid profiles, many,"
many,things improved.
5185.48,The rat was exercising
and,it got healthier
5187.54,"and presumably happier,"
5188.61,"we don't know, we could've asked it,"
5190.13,but we wouldn't know. It
doesn't,"know how to tell us,"
5192.263,but we can measure blood lipids.
5193.75,We can measure blood pressure
and,all sorts of things.
5196.2,"And indeed, when that rat"
exercised,"or when people exercise,"
5200.28,they generally get healthier.
5202.13,"Except, in that particular experiment,"
5204.29,they had another animal
5206.85,"where every time rat number one, ran,"
5210.76,rat number two was forced to run.
5213.52,It was on a running wheel
5214.43,"and it was forced to run,"
not,"because it wanted to,"
5216.82,but because it was forced to.
5218.69,"And what was remarkable,"
5220.02,is that the physiological effects
5221.77,"of being forced to do something,"
5223.74,were in the complete opposite
direction,as they were
5226.6,when those same behaviors
were,undertaken voluntarily.
5229.62,"In other words, the rat"
that,"was choosing to run,"
5232.22,got healthier
5233.1,and the rat that was forced
to,"run became unhealthy,"
5236.52,blood pressure went up in a direction
5238.14,that wasn't effective and useful.
5239.75,Blood lipids got worse.
5240.89,"Stress hormones went up,"
et,"cetera, et cetera."
5242.92,And you see the same thing in humans.
5245.07,"Now, what this says,"
5246.11,is that our subjective understanding
5249.95,"of why we are doing something,"
5251.87,is fundamentally important for the effects
5254.68,that we will get from that behavior.
5256.4,And indeed the effects of
that,behavior will have on us.
5259.6,So this has two major implications.
5261.53,"First of all, in terms"
of,"reward schedules,"
5264.07,we can decide to use any
reward,schedule that we want
5267.271,for a given behavior.
5268.47,We can decide that the milestones for a...
5270.858,Let's say a plan of getting
5273.17,in really terrific cardiovascular
shape,over the next year.
5276.13,We can decide to assess every day
5279.66,and ask ourselves how
good,was our progress.
5281.59,"And if we made progress, then"
we're,going to reward ourselves.
5283.79,We could do that every third day.
5285.45,We could do it every week.
5286.79,"We could do it every five minutes,"
5288.18,if we actually had the time to do that.
5290.24,"The reward schedule, the dopamine system,"
5292.8,is highly susceptible to
the,subjective effects.
5296.0,"These so-called, top-down effects"
5297.41,of when we decide that something
is,"going to be good for us,"
5300.69,"if we analyze it on a given timeframe,"
5303.21,"well, then it's going to be good for us."
5305.37,"So, what I suggest people do"
5307.17,is pick a particular interval
5309.06,at which they are going
to,assess progress.
5311.09,And if you've been making
regular,progress towards a goal
5314.36,that you reward yourself
5315.217,and the reward indeed is all cognitive.
5318.51,It's all mental.
5319.37,"It's telling yourself, yes,"
I'm,on the right track.
5322.14,"Now, some people will say, wait,"
5324.38,but I want to know exactly
how,often I should do that.
5326.81,You need to do that at an interval
5329.1,that you can maintain consistently.
5331.73,So you're not going to
reward,yourself every minute
5334.58,"or every step of every jog that you take,"
5336.9,"unless you can do it,"
every,minute of every step
5338.82,of every jog that you take.
5340.07,"For that reason, I think that daily"
5342.398,"or ideally, weekly assessments"
are,going to be best.
5345.83,I think that checking
in,"at the end of a week,"
5347.41,looking back on the previous week
5348.87,and assessing how well you performed
5351.18,in pursuit of a given goal.
5352.78,"How many times a week you ran,"
5354.54,"or how many times you studied,"
5355.81,or how many times you did
something,that you wanted to do
5357.79,or avoided something that
you,didn't want to do.
5359.8,I think that's a reasonable
and,tractable schedule
5364.38,to assess once a week.
5366.67,"So that's one point,"
5367.69,that pick a milestone that
you,can maintain consistently
5371.67,throughout the pursuit of a goal.
5373.91,"The second thing, is that"
the,subjective effects
5377.61,that were described by that Sapolsky study
5380.12,or that Sapolsky described
"rather,",are absolutely essential
5384.9,for all aspects of goal seeking behavior.
5387.41,We cannot underestimate the extent
5389.48,to which the dopamine system and our sense
5391.62,of whether or not we
are,"on the right track,"
5393.56,is under our cognitive control.
5396.06,If we constantly place ourselves
5398.49,into a mode of thinking
that,"we are failing, well,"
5401.89,"then indeed, we are not going"
to,churn out much dopamine.
5405.03,"Now, earlier, I said, we need to predict"
5407.2,"and visualize failure,"
5408.9,but that is not the same thing
5410.72,as thinking about ourselves as failing.
5413.33,We need to predict what the
outcome,"would be if we failed,"
5417.0,but then encountering that
5418.93,"and in behaving in a certain way,"
5420.367,"and thinking in a certain way,"
5421.58,in pursuing our goals in an effective way.
5424.73,"Maybe checking in on that each week,"
5426.52,we definitely need to
reward,ourselves cognitively
5429.67,for the correct and successful pursuit.
5432.73,What this means is that
anticipate,and think about failure
5435.7,as a mechanism of generating motivation
5438.1,"and indeed fear and anxiety,"
5439.67,so that you lean into
the,correct behaviors
5441.62,and you lean away from
the,incorrect behaviors
5443.68,to reach your goal.
5444.84,"But then weekly or so,"
5446.15,"whatever you can maintain consistently,"
5448.364,you absolutely want to
reward,yourself cognitively
5451.53,"by telling yourself,"
I'm,on the right track.
5453.53,"I got another week where I accomplish,"
5455.66,whatever it is that I'm
trying,to accomplish.
5457.84,"A concrete example that I'm following now,"
5459.58,is this 150 to 200 minutes
of,"zone two cardio per week,"
5462.54,because that's shown to be very effective
5465.352,in improving mental and
physical,health metrics.
5467.121,"So once a week, I'll check in with myself."
5469.24,If I reach that 150 to
200,"minutes threshold,"
5473.28,then I'll reward myself simply
5474.6,by checking off a box and
"saying,","okay, I'm on track."
5477.26,I'm on track.
5478.093,I'm on track.
5479.07,"This dopamine system is critical to re-up,"
5482.2,"to remind ourselves that we are on track,"
5484.05,if indeed we are on track
5485.71,because dopamine itself
provides,a state of motivation
5489.917,and readiness to continue
5491.68,in the regular pursuit of our goals.
5494.4,"Dopamine, the molecule, is actually used"
5498.31,to manufacture epinephrine
and,norepinephrine.
5500.84,Which are other molecules
in,"our brain and body,"
5503.04,which put us into that
readiness,and action state.
5505.47,There are actually the molecules
5506.57,that help generate that increase
5508.02,"in systolic blood pressure,"
5509.33,that puts us into a state of readiness.
5511.9,So you can think about dopamine
5513.63,"as a self amplifying system,"
5515.78,provided that you are
leveraging,the dopamine system
5519.68,on a consistent schedule.
5521.469,"Now, by also following a"
consistent,"schedule of self reward,"
5525.23,you set yourself up for any
positive,"unanticipated rewards,"
5529.64,that may happen.
5530.59,"So for instance, if you're"
checking,"in with yourself weekly,"
5533.44,"telling yourself that you're doing well,"
5534.71,if indeed you are.
5535.81,"And then out of nowhere,"
5537.6,"for instance, you're out on a run"
5539.18,"or you're doing something,"
5540.06,I'm using fitness as an example.
5541.32,"But you're doing something,"
5542.153,you find yourself performing
particularly,"well,"
5544.23,that's a unexpected dopamine reward
5547.0,that will further amplify the system.
5549.42,"Now I know many people out there,"
5551.04,having heard me talk about
dopamine,"before, worry,"
5553.35,"well, can I release too much dopamine"
5555.38,and then the whole system will crash
5556.8,and then I'll run out of motivation?
5558.56,"In general, that doesn't happen"
5560.36,"unless people are using pharmacology,"
5562.9,supplements or prescription
drugs,or illicit drugs
5565.16,to increase dopamine.
5566.68,This is why I'm a big fan
of,"things like, cold showers"
5570.03,"and cold water exposure,"
5571.77,which has been shown to lead
5572.9,to long-lasting 2.5 X
increases,"in dopamine,"
5577.52,"or in some cases,"
5578.5,supplementation with
things,"like L-Tyrosine,"
5580.4,which are precursors to dopamine.
5582.01,"Or in some cases, caffeine,"
5583.12,which can increase the number
5584.22,"of dopamine receptors that we have,"
5585.98,so that whatever dopamine
we,have floating around
5588.1,can be more effective
5589.28,in activating these motivational states.
5591.96,But things that really increase dopamine
5594.95,and then cause it to
"crash,",can be problematic.
5597.51,"One way to conceive of dopamine,"
5599.16,is as a sort of dopamine wave pool.
5601.42,"You've probably seen these wave pools,"
5602.68,where some pressure is
pushed,into the pool
5604.98,and then you get these waves going.
5606.42,"If those waves are consistent enough,"
5608.52,"and they're are of high enough amplitude,"
5611.07,the waves can continue to go
up,and down and up and down.
5615.14,"But if it's a giant wave,"
5616.6,"if you get a huge blast of dopamine,"
5619.04,well then a bunch of the water
sloshes,out of the wave pool
5621.85,and then you basically
have,"to take some time off,"
5624.44,reset that dopamine level.
5625.82,That's what happens in addiction
5627.03,and when people start
pushing,in a lot of drugs
5630.83,or other things into the system
5631.94,that increase dopamine too much.
5633.87,So today we've almost
exclusively,been talking
5635.86,about behavioral tools.
5637.298,It is possible to incorporate supplements
5639.77,"and things of that sort, that"
can,increase dopamine as a way
5642.594,to getting into ongoing
motivational,states.
5646.14,But I caution people about
relying,on those too much.
5649.85,"Really what you want,"
5651.41,is you want a situation where
your,"own positive feedback,"
5654.54,"your own understanding,"
5655.5,that you are reaching the milestones
5657.11,that you've set out for yourself.
5659.21,"That you're achieving those,"
5660.67,and that is what's causing these waves
5662.54,or these increases in dopamine
5663.89,that will further amplify
your,motivational states.
5666.93,Another very interesting
aspect,of dopamine
5669.3,that I've not talked about at all
5670.85,"on this podcast before,"
5672.41,is actually how the
dopamine,system interacts
5675.26,with the visual system.
5676.73,We've talked a lot about
5678.592,"how harnessing your visual attention,"
5679.425,to a particular point is great
5681.46,and can help serve your
ability,to both set
5685.79,and achieve goals.
5688.39,Really wonderful work that
was,"done by Wolfram Schultz,"
5690.86,who's one of the great pioneers
5692.5,in this area of dopamine
5693.73,"and dopamine reward prediction error,"
5695.74,showed that for people that
have,"normal levels of dopamine,"
5698.92,"their visual search,"
5700.01,meaning how they scanned
visual,"environments,"
5701.75,tends to be pretty constrained.
5703.05,They might move their eyes
5704.07,around a particular visual
"environment,",searching somewhat.
5708.52,"For people that lack dopamine,"
5710.8,they actually have very
little,movement of their eyes.
5713.35,They don't actually tend to
look,very far into the horizon.
5716.34,They're don't have that
very,focused vergence point
5718.69,that we're talking about that kind of a...
5719.97,"I guess for lack of a better phrase,"
5721.24,that kind of eye of the
"tiger,",focus on a goal.
5723.5,"Rather, their eye movements are depleted"
5726.77,and they're not actually
evaluating,horizons
5729.21,"off in their future,"
5730.13,they're not focused so much
on,the extrapersonal space.
5734.25,And this actually can be restored
5735.8,and some of these took place
in,Parkinson's patients
5738.41,and other people who
have,"dopamine depleted,"
5740.4,that when dopamine is
restored,"pharmacologically,"
5743.52,their visual focus is re-enhanced again.
5746.93,"Now, there are a lot of"
details,to this study
5748.74,that don't map perfectly onto everything
5750.33,that I've talked about.
5751.25,"But the point is this, when we are focused"
5754.21,on a particular point in visual space
5755.95,or a particular goal or horizon.
5758.578,"All those systems, our"
blood,"pressure, epinephrine"
5761.26,"and indeed dopamine, get recruited"
5763.89,to put us into a state of readiness
5765.97,and willingness to go pursue things
5767.72,in that extrapersonal space.
5770.04,"When our visual attention is very diffuse,"
5773.23,"all of that relaxes,"
5774.44,and we tend to be more comfortable staying
5776.38,"in the place that we are,"
in,our peripersonal space
5779.95,and the effect works in
the,other direction too.
5782.602,"When dopamine is increased,"
5784.82,our visual attention for
particular,"things out in space,"
5787.66,increase.
5788.493,So the way it works is reciprocal.
5790.97,When we use our visual system
and,"in a particular way,"
5794.08,"bring it to a point of focus,"
5795.25,it recruits chemical and neural systems
5797.29,in our brain and body
5798.123,that put us into a state
of,readiness and pursuit.
5800.88,"And, when we increase certain chemicals"
5804.64,"in our brain and body, like"
"epinephrine,","like dopamine,"
5807.34,then we also allow our visual system
5810.48,to be in a state of looking
out,at particular locations
5814.15,in our visual world.
5815.32,So the system works in both directions
5817.44,and some people leverage this
by,using things like caffeine
5820.35,or taking things like
L-Tyrosine,to increase dopamine.
5823.06,"And again, it works both ways,"
5824.55,there's no right or wrong way to do it.
5826.42,I'm a particular fan of
using,"behavioral tools,"
5829.63,always prior to using supplementation
5832.97,or any kinds of other tools
5834.41,because behavioral tools
have,a very unique feature
5836.94,that supplementation and
other,chemical tools don't.
5840.3,Which is that behavioral
tools,"used over time,"
5842.929,engage neuroplasticity.
5844.63,"As we start to practice,"
5846.59,using our visual system
to,harness our attention
5848.58,to particular locations
5849.72,"and in that way, move"
to,"our particular goals,"
5851.97,we get better and better
at,using those systems.
5854.17,"In fact, the systems for"
focus,"and motivation,"
5856.88,"themselves have plasticity,"
5858.18,so we get better at being
motivated,and focused
5860.98,when we place our visual
attention,at a given location.
5864.42,"Using chemical assistance of a safe kind,"
5867.13,"of course, check with your doctor."
5868.26,But things like L-Tyrosine or
caffeine,"or those combined,"
5870.84,"yes, it will increase dopamine"
5872.067,"and will increase our ability,"
5873.88,to engage in visual focus somewhat.
5875.713,"But those compounds alone,"
5877.81,don't modify the circuitry
in,the way that we want.
5880.53,"So I always say, behavioral tools first,"
5882.87,"then nutritional tools,"
then,supplementation tools
5884.967,"and then if it's right for you and safe,"
5886.97,maybe you advance into some
5888.05,of the other more sophisticated tools.
5889.96,I'd like to just briefly recap
5891.41,what I've covered up until now.
5893.05,"And again, emphasize that much"
5894.3,of what I've covered has been based
5895.66,on the beautiful work of
Emily,Balcetis and colleagues.
5898.26,I do hope to get her as a guest
on,"the podcast, by the way."
5901.4,"First of all, set goals that"
are,"challenging, but possible,"
5904.53,"those moderate goals, not super"
"easy,",not super difficult.
5907.81,"But moderately challenging goals,"
5909.77,seem to be the most effective
5911.23,in moving people towards their goals
5913.21,over the short and longterm.
5914.74,"Second, plan concretely,"
5916.546,you need a concrete set of actions
5918.3,that you're going to follow
in,order to reach your goals.
5921.296,"Third, foreshadow failure."
5924.22,This is a somewhat surprising one to me.
5926.61,"I would have anticipated,"
5927.92,that imagining success is the way to go.
5930.83,It turns out that imagining
success,"and visualizing success,"
5934.01,can be useful at the outset of a goal
5936.4,and maybe every once in a while
5938.0,in pursuit of that goal.
5939.62,But that it's not terrific for putting you
5942.17,"in constant pursuit of that goal,"
5944.15,"rather, foreshadowing"
"failure,",visualizing failure
5946.87,and all the terrible things
5947.78,"that it's going to bring,"
5949.15,seems to be more effective.
5949.983,And that maps very well to what's known
5951.7,about the neural circuitry
5952.533,and the involvement of the amygdala.
5955.21,Focus on particular visual points
5958.32,as a way to harness your attention
5960.07,and to remove distractors.
5963.22,Removing distractors and
getting,your body and brain
5965.81,into a mode of activation.
5967.24,Getting that healthy increase
in,"systolic blood pressure,"
5969.76,that puts you into forward motion
5971.92,"towards your goals, is absolutely key."
5973.95,So that's a brief summary
5975.41,of what I've covered up until now.
5977.21,"There were other things too,"
of,"course, the dopamine system"
5979.57,and the power of
subjective,top-down control
5984.7,in regulating that dopamine system.
5987.01,"But I want to be sure to include a tool,"
5989.71,"that's been especially powerful for me,"
5991.62,that's grounded in the
neuroscience,research
5993.84,and in the psychology research.
5995.74,"And as I describe this tool next,"
5997.91,I think you'll see the ways
5999.05,in which it measures nicely
6000.88,with the work that Emily Balcetis
and,colleagues have done.
6004.44,"This is something that,"
6005.81,"I've personally been doing for many years,"
6007.81,based on my understanding
of,the visual system
6010.58,and the understanding that
6012.091,indeed we can move our cognition
6014.513,and our perception from
a,place of interoception
6018.502,and focusing on our peripersonal space.
6021.41,That space within us and
immediately,around us
6023.95,and on the things that are
immediately,accessible to us.
6027.15,That we can shift from that mode
6028.74,to this mode of exteroception
6031.05,of focusing on things outside
the,confines of our skin
6034.48,"and that are beyond our reach,"
6036.12,that are literally goal directed behaviors
6038.22,and goal directed thoughts.
6040.15,"And this is something that in the past,"
6042.1,I have talked about a little bit
6043.93,and I've talked about something
"called,",space-time bridging.
6046.07,And we haven't talked too much
6047.18,about the time domain of
the,visual system today.
6050.22,"But space-time bridging, is simply a way"
6053.46,of using one's visual system
6055.34,to focus on the peripersonal
space,and interoception.
6058.61,"And then gradually in a deliberate way,"
6060.76,stepping one's focus into
the,extra personal space
6064.14,and then back to the peripersonal space
6066.19,in a way that gives you a lot
of,flexibility and control
6069.89,over that ability in your daily life.
6073.26,"So, I'm going to first describe the tool,"
6075.61,and then I will explain more
about,the underlying science
6078.42,and the underlying mechanism.
6080.95,Here's how you would do this.
6083.49,"You could do this indoors or outdoors,"
6085.71,"although, ideally, you"
would,do it in a location
6088.41,where you could view a horizon.
6089.61,It could be through a window
6090.57,"or ideally outdoors, without a window."
6093.461,It could be done anytime of day.
6095.198,"At night, it might be a"
little,"more challenging,"
6096.21,but it goes the following way.
6098.54,"What you first do, is you"
would,"close your eyes,"
6101.83,this could be done sitting or standing.
6103.18,But you would close your eyes
6104.59,and you would focus as
much,"of your attention,"
6108.018,including your visual attention
6110.018,"on your inner landscape,"
on,your interoception.
6113.01,So that would be your
"breathing,","your heart rate,"
6114.85,"maybe even the surface of your skin,"
6116.25,but really focusing internally.
6118.01,"Now, how can you focus your"
visual,"attention internally,"
6120.14,if your eyes are closed?
6121.29,"Well, you do that by imagining"
your,inner landscape.
6124.94,So you don't have to
imagine,your heart beating
6126.48,and so forth.
6127.313,But what you're trying to
do,is eliminate perception
6128.94,of the outside world.
6130.23,You're eliminating exteroception
6131.82,and you're focusing all of
your,cognitive attention
6134.9,and your perceptual attention
6136.25,on what you're experiencing
6137.38,within the confines of your skin
6139.68,or at the level of the
surface,of your skin
6142.02,and inside your body.
6143.2,And you would do that for a duration
6145.89,of approximately three slow breaths.
6149.34,So close your eyes.
6150.23,"You do breath one, breath"
two,"and breath three,"
6154.48,concentrating all your attention
6155.72,on your internal landscape.
6157.35,Then you would open your eyes
6159.5,and you would focus your visual attention
6161.16,on some area on the surface of your body.
6163.47,"So for me, the way that"
I,"typically do this,"
6164.94,"will be to focus on,"
say,the palm of my hand.
6167.41,So I'll focus my visual
attention,on the palm of my hand.
6169.58,"And I then do three breaths again,"
6172.96,"focusing on my internal state,"
6175.14,but now I'm splitting out a little bit
6177.3,of my attention from
interoception,to exteroception.
6180.25,"I'm focusing on something outside me,"
6181.97,the ratio or the split of
attention,"is about 90, 10,"
6185.63,about 90% of my attention
is,"focused internally,"
6188.43,but I'm also focusing some
of,my attention externally.
6192.63,Most people can do this pretty easily.
6194.58,"Then, there's a third,"
what,"I call, station."
6197.06,I now move my visual
attention,"to outside my body,"
6200.68,"to some location in the room,"
6202.26,or if I'm outside in the
external,"environment,"
6204.06,something in the range
of,five to 15 feet away.
6206.83,And I'm trying to move 90% of my attention
6210.0,to that external object.
6211.22,So now I'm really biasing my
perception,and my attention
6214.1,towards exteroception.
6217.58,"As I breathe, I'm paying"
attention,"to those three breaths,"
6219.86,"so that's why there's still 10%,"
6221.21,that's focused on my internal landscape
6223.06,because I want to pay attention
to,those three breasts.
6225.07,"But I'm focusing as much of my attention,"
6227.06,"outside of myself,"
maintaining,just a little bit
6230.479,"on my internal state,"
6231.73,so I can measure the cadence
of,those three breaths.
6235.19,Then I move my visual attention
to,"yet another station,"
6238.05,"which is further away,"
"typically,",a horizon
6240.01,"or something as far off in the distance,"
6241.98,as I can possibly see.
6243.38,Again for the duration of three breaths.
6246.73,"And at that point, I'm trying"
my,"very best to move 99,"
6250.55,if not 100% of my attention
to,that external location.
6256.02,"And then, what I typically will do,"
6258.74,is I will try and expand both my vision
6262.75,and my cognition to a much broader sphere.
6265.16,"This is that, magnocellular vision"
6266.62,"that we talked about before,"
6268.1,where I'm not focusing
6269.23,on a particular location on the horizon.
6270.72,I'm trying to dilate the
aperture,"of my field of view,"
6273.03,so I can see as much
of,the visual landscape
6275.42,as I'm in as possible.
6276.8,"If you're in an internal, excuse me,"
6279.57,"if you're in indoors,"
6281.24,"then that might be the ceiling, the walls"
6283.45,and the floor of the
environment,you're in.
6285.08,"If you're outdoors, it would"
be,to expand your visual focus
6287.77,as broadly as you possibly can.
6290.06,"Again, for the duration of three breaths,"
6292.76,then I would return immediately
to,my internal landscape.
6296.9,I would close my eyes
6297.95,and I would do three more
breasts,focusing entirely
6301.37,"on my interoception, on"
my,internal landscape
6305.16,"or what we called before,"
my,peripersonal space.
6307.97,"And I would then repeat that,"
6310.6,"peripersonal space, 100%,"
6312.86,"focus on my hand, 90%,"
6314.91,10% on my peripersonal space
or,my internal landscape.
6318.8,Stepping out to another location
6320.5,"where it's mostly exteroception,"
6322.62,maybe a little bit of
recognition,"of my internal state,"
6325.64,"then to the horizon,"
6326.81,then to this broader visual
"sphere,",then back into my body.
6329.67,And I would work through
each,"of those stations,"
6331.9,maybe two or three times.
6333.2,The entire thing takes about
90,"seconds to three minutes,"
6336.64,depending on how many breaths you do.
6338.63,"I said three,"
6339.463,but you could do one or 10.
6341.04,It doesn't really matter.
6342.5,"Or, it's also going to depend on,"
6345.5,"for instance, how slowly your breathing."
6347.46,'Cause your breathing might be faster
6348.73,than mine or vice versa.
6351.14,What is all of this doing?
6352.17,Why do I call this space-time bridging?
6354.2,And why is this useful for goal setting?
6356.6,"The reason I call it space-time bridging,"
6358.72,"is that the visual system,"
6360.41,is not just about analyzing space.
6363.12,It's actually how we batch time.
6365.33,It's how we carve up time.
6366.87,"And the simple way to state this is that,"
6368.9,when we focus our visual attention
6370.51,"on a very narrow point,"
6372.78,that's close to our body
6374.71,and our immediate experience.
6376.44,"We tend to slice up time, very finely."
6379.25,We're focused on our breathing.
6380.87,We're focused on our heartbeats.
6382.84,"In fact, our breathing"
and,our internal landscape
6385.07,and our heartbeats
6385.903,become the sort of
seconds,"hand, if you will"
6388.53,on our experience.
6389.51,"We are carving up time,"
6390.82,according to our immediate
physiological,experience.
6394.32,Whereas when we focus our visual
attention,"outside our body,"
6398.0,"not only do we engage that exteroceptive,"
6400.69,"extra personal space system,"
6402.15,and we start to engage
the,"dopamine system,"
6403.93,"the goal-directed system,"
6405.82,but we also start
batching,time differently.
6409.31,When we focus our visual system
6410.93,into a broader sphere
of,space or into a space
6413.71,"beyond the confines of our skin,"
6415.52,"we start carving up time,"
our,frame rate changes.
6418.879,Now this is useful in the
context,"of goal setting,"
6422.52,goal assessment and goal pursuit.
6424.24,Because with the exception of
a,"very few isolated examples,"
6429.367,"almost all goals, involve"
setting,"some goal,"
6433.293,"that's off in the future,"
6435.62,and then carving up the time between now
6437.98,and the achievement of
that,"goal into milestones,"
6440.71,that range in duration.
6443.19,"And the rewards, even if we try"
6445.36,"and just make them every week,"
6446.68,are going to come at
some,unexpected intervals
6449.76,and that's actually can be helpful
6450.95,"for reinforcing behavior,"
intermittent,reward.
6453.48,That's intermittent
6454.74,and random is the most effective
reward,"schedule we know,"
6459.45,"but the problem is always,"
6460.66,how do we keep our cognition
6462.38,in line with the long-term goal
6463.94,while also being focused
6465.18,on these more immediate goals?
6466.43,"And so this particular practice,"
6467.88,"that I call space-time bridging,"
6469.17,but we could give it a different name.
6470.56,I'm sure there are better names.
6471.56,Maybe you can suggest some
6472.43,"in the comment section on YouTube,"
6474.57,that are more accurate
or,map to it better.
6477.35,"But this behavior or this practice rather,"
6480.31,is teaching us to use our visual system
6482.75,and thereby our cognitive system
6484.68,"and thereby our reward systems,"
6487.23,to orient to different locations in space
6489.84,and therefore different locations in time.
6492.88,And that is the essence
of,goal directed behavior.
6496.3,That is the essence of setting a goal.
6498.55,It's about thinking about what you want.
6500.52,Then it's about setting milestones
6503.41,that are intermediate to that goal.
6505.73,Then it's about assessing whether
6507.21,or not you're reaching those milestones.
6508.86,"And then, it's of course"
about,"updating your goals,"
6511.25,if you need to update your goals.
6513.03,All of that is an enormously
confusing,"batch of challenges,"
6517.05,"if you think about it all at once,"
6518.69,but if you break it down
into,"these elements,"
6520.82,that the visual system can help you find
6523.13,and move towards those milestones.
6524.65,I think there's ample
evidence,to support that
6526.6,and that your control
over,"your visual system,"
6529.18,"is indeed yours,"
6530.14,that you can deliberately set
it,to different locations.
6532.4,And then you make a practice
6534.54,of stepping through
these,different stations
6537.41,on a regular basis.
6538.38,"Again, I do this each morning."
6539.75,I do this once a day.
6541.784,Rarely have I done it twice a day.
6543.57,Rarely have I missed a day.
6544.97,"But by doing that, you"
can,be very effective
6547.52,in teaching the systems of your brain
6549.93,that are related to
goal,"setting and reward,"
6551.88,to map to different timeframes.
6553.89,"So, I found this to be a"
very,"effective protocol,"
6556.93,the Balcetis work has mainly focused
6559.281,on visual tools that
are,of a single horizon.
6563.56,Here I'm talking about multiple
6564.96,what I called stations or horizons.
6567.19,"But what's very clear, is"
that,an ability to move
6570.37,from different visual stations
6572.33,and to do that in a deliberate way
6574.41,in a focused and conscious way.
6576.389,"Clearly maps to an ability,"
6578.66,to conceive of different goals
6580.29,over different periods of time.
6581.85,And I do believe can be greatly beneficial
6584.31,in allowing one to set particular goals
6587.13,and then move through the
milestones,to those goals
6589.4,and to constantly update one's pursuit
6591.7,and reward in reaching those milestones
6593.7,"and eventually, the overall goal."
6595.93,"Per usual, I covered a"
lot,of material today.
6598.05,We talked about some of the neuroscience
6600.15,and psychology and popular understanding
6602.9,of goal seeking behavior.
6605.43,"How to assess goals, et cetera."
6607.4,Talked about the beautiful
work,of Emily Balcetis
6609.35,at New York University
6611.33,and her work on the use
of,"the visual system,"
6614.66,to better achieve goals.
6616.65,And indeed things like visualization
6619.39,and why forecasting failure
can,be more effective
6621.57,than forecasting success
6623.13,as counter intuitive as that might seem.
6625.36,That's what the data point to.
6626.95,And we talked about the importance
of,setting concrete plans
6629.8,and really what that means.
6631.43,And what intervals at
which,to assess progress.
6634.89,And what intervals at
which,to assess reward
6637.56,and how the dopamine system is involved.
6639.6,"And in addition, I described this practice"
6641.69,that one can incorporate as a daily
6644.08,or semi-daily practice of
"so-called,",space-time bridging
6646.96,of using the visual system
6648.54,and your ability to deliberately
step,your visual system
6651.83,from stations that are within your body.
6654.33,So-called peripersonal or
interoceptive,space out
6657.43,into the world further and further.
6658.67,And then back again in sequence
6660.45,as a way to harness and cultivate
6662.96,and build up these
systems,"that link vision,"
6665.757,"space, time, reward systems and so forth."
6669.228,"Ultimately, as you set out"
to,"accomplish your goals,"
6673.45,there are going to be
a,number of basic steps
6675.68,that everyone will have to follow.
6676.94,"You have to clearly identify,"
6678.35,what the long arching ultimate goal is.
6680.69,You have to identify what
the,milestones will be.
6683.91,You might not know all
of,"them at the outset,"
6685.52,but you ought to have some idea
6686.88,about the intervals at which you are going
6688.7,to set those milestones
6691.02,and set your reward schedule
for,assessing progress
6695.16,in route to those milestones
in,your ultimate goal.
6698.01,My hope is that you'll be able
to,"incorporate these tools,"
6700.57,"if not all of them,"
6702.24,perhaps just one of them or two of them
6704.15,"in pursuit of whatever particular goals,"
6706.24,you happen to be focused on at this point
6708.42,and in the future.
