0.38,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.42,where we discuss science 
3.427,and science-based tools for everyday life. 
5.875,[gentle music] 
9.22,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.17,and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology 
12.72,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.66,This podcast is separate 
15.7,from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
18.0,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
20.0,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
22.91,and science-related tools to the general public. 
25.61,"In keeping with that theme, "
26.71,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
29.58,Our first sponsor is Roka. 
31.73,Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses 
33.73,that in my opinion are the absolute best out there. 
37.4,The sunglasses and eyeglasses that are made by Roka 
39.64,have a number of properties that are really unique. 
41.56,"First of all, they're extremely lightweight, "
43.76,you never even notice that they're on your face. 
45.85,"Second, the optical clarity is fantastic. "
49.03,"One of the things that's really hard to accomplish, "
50.95,but that Roka succeeded in accomplishing 
53.22,is making sunglasses that you can wear 
55.14,in lots of different environments. 
56.95,"As you move from bright to shadowed regions for instance, "
60.46,or as the amount of sunlight changes 
62.8,many eyeglasses will make it such 
64.41,that it's hard to see your environment 
65.72,"and you need to take the eyeglasses off, "
67.29,or you can't see or detect borders. 
69.06,"With Roka sunglasses, all of that is seamless, "
72.03,they clearly understand the adaptation mechanisms 
75.96,"and habituation mechanisms, "
77.12,all these fancy details about the human visual system 
79.52,have allowed them to design a sunglass 
81.67,that allows you to be in any environment 
83.25,and to see that environment extremely well. 
86.53,"The eyeglasses are terrific, "
87.91,I wear readers at night 
89.21,"and again, they just make the whole experience of reading "
92.44,"or working on a screen at night very, very easy, "
95.64,very easy on the eyes. 
96.85,The aesthetic of the eyeglasses 
98.12,and sunglasses is also suburb. 
100.15,"You know, I chuckle sometimes "
101.25,"when I see sports frames or sports glasses, "
103.58,"a lot of them just look ridiculous frankly, "
105.58,but the Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses 
107.95,"have a terrific aesthetic, "
109.13,they have a huge variety to select from. 
111.22,"If you'd like to try Roka glasses, "
112.76,"you can go to Roka, "
113.94,that's roka.com and enter the code Huberman 
117.32,and you'll get 
20%,"off your first order, "
119.54,that's roka.com and enter the code Huberman 
123.01,to get 
20%,off your first order. 
125.23,Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
128.723,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
131.37,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
134.18,to help you better understand your body 
135.77,and help you reach your health goals. 
137.93,I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done 
140.56,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
143.29,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
145.49,can only be detected from a quality blood test. 
148.95,One of the major problems with blood tests however 
151.36,is that oftentimes you'll get information back 
154.2,"about levels of metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera, "
157.25,and there won't be any directives 
158.65,about what to do with that information. 
160.75,"With InsideTracker, it makes all of that very easy. "
163.77,"First of all, they can come to your home "
165.48,to do the blood test and DNA test 
167.21,"or you can go to a local clinic, "
169.48,they make that very easy. 
170.78,"Second of all, when you get the information back "
173.28,"about the levels of hormones, "
174.58,"and metabolic factors, and other things in your blood "
177.03,it gives you simple directives. 
178.35,They have a dashboard that allows you to assess 
181.07,"for instance, whether or not you ought to make changes "
183.2,"in your nutrition, or changes in your exercise, "
185.59,"or changes in your sleep regimen, "
187.34,any number of different lifestyle factors 
189.02,that can help bring the markers and the various factors 
192.44,in your blood and DNA to the appropriate levels. 
195.54,"So, really they're putting you "
197.0,in the driver's seat for your health. 
198.88,"In fact, one of the listeners of this podcast "
201.52,"contacted me recently and said I took an InsideTracker test, "
205.1,"I felt like I was in great health, "
206.66,but I noticed from the test 
208.37,"that I had high CRP, C-reactive protein. "
211.15,C-reactive protein is a marker that if it's too high 
214.13,is a cautionary note 
216.32,"about various cardiac and even eye diseases, "
219.53,so it's something that they are now taking actions on 
222.39,as a consequence of getting their blood work done 
224.56,and taking the InsideTracker test. 
225.94,"So, I think that's just one of many examples "
228.36,that we hear about. 
229.32,I have examples from my own life 
230.62,for instance of different factors in my blood being off 
233.227,and making adjustments to nutrition 
235.55,and other aspects of my life 
236.68,that have allowed me to bring those into the proper range. 
239.22,"So, if you care about your health "
240.609,InsideTracker may very well be right for you. 
242.97,If you'd like to try InsideTracker 
244.92,you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. 
247.94,"And if you do that, you'll get "
25%,off 
250.07,"any of InsideTracker's plans, "
251.86,just use the code Huberman at checkout. 
254.32,Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. 
257.36,"Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, "
259.58,mineral probiotic drink. 
261.63,I've been using Athletic Greens since 
2012,
264.8,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
267.55,Athletic Greens is terrific 
268.92,because it covers your nutritional bases. 
271.64,If I drink Athletic Greens once 
273.12,"and I sometimes drink it twice a day, "
275.33,"then I'm sure that all the vitamins I need, "
277.95,I'm getting those. 
278.783,"All the minerals I need, I'm getting those, "
280.15,and the probiotics. 
281.67,There's now a ton of data 
283.34,showing that a healthy gut microbiome 
285.81,"is vital to brain function, "
287.56,"vital to immune function, "
288.88,and vital to all aspects of our health. 
291.29,"So with Athletic Greens, you get the vitamins, "
293.21,"the minerals, and the probiotics to cover all your bases. "
296.14,"In fact, anytime people ask me what should they take "
299.18,"or what could they do to support their health, "
301.19,provided that they already have their sleep 
302.88,"and other aspects of their life in order, "
304.8,Athletic Greens is the thing that I recommend 
306.8,"because it covers all the foundations, all the bases "
310.25,of what one really wants from a supplement 
312.41,without having to take a ton of different things. 
314.52,"It also tastes great, "
315.8,almost everybody that tries it 
317.22,and then reported back to me has told me 
319.04,that they really liked the taste. 
320.39,"I mix mine with water, "
321.61,"a little bit of lemon and lime juice, "
322.91,"and I really like the taste, it's delicious to me. "
325.31,I drink it once or twice a day. 
327.33,"It's keto compatible, "
328.67,"it's compatible with most fasting regimens, "
330.95,it's compatible with if you're a vegan 
334.52,"or if you're not vegan, it's compatible "
335.98,"with essentially every nutritional plan out there, "
337.93,so it's just a terrific all around supplement 
340.43,and benefit to one's health and diet. 
343.28,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
344.71,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman. 
347.69,"And if you do that, you'll claim a special offer, "
349.67,they'll give you five free travel packs 
351.31,that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
353.1,"while you're on the road, "
354.17,and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D
"3,",K
2.,
358.16,"Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman "
361.22,to claim that special offer. 
362.92,"This month, we've been talking about the senses, "
365.23,how we detect things in our environment. 
368.32,"The last episode was all about vision, "
370.7,how we take light and convert that information 
373.81,into things that we can perceive 
375.6,"like colors, and faces, and motion, "
378.11,things of that sort 
378.943,as well as how we use light to change our biology 
381.8,"in ways that are subconscious that we don't realize, "
384.24,"things like mood, and metabolism, and levels of alertness. "
388.72,"Today, we're going to talk about chemical sensing, "
391.58,"we're going to talk about the sense of smell, "
394.36,our ability to detect odors in our environment. 
397.72,"We're also going to talk about taste, "
399.68,our ability to detect chemicals 
402.31,and make sense of chemicals that are put in our mouth 
405.9,and into our digestive tract. 
407.81,And we are going to talk about chemicals 
409.77,that are made by other human beings 
412.27,"that powerfully modulator the way that we feel, "
415.03,"our hormones, and our health. "
417.51,"Now, that last category are sometimes called pheromones. "
421.09,"However, whether or not pheromones exist in humans "
424.17,"is rather controversial, "
425.6,there actually hasn't been a clear example 
428.24,"of a true human pheromonal effect, "
431.0,"but what is absolutely clear, what is undeniable "
434.2,is that there are chemicals that human beings make 
438.1,"and release in things like tears onto our skin, "
442.58,"and sweat, and even breath that powerfully modulate "
447.12,or control the biology of other individuals. 
450.16,"In fact right now, even if you're completely alone, "
453.72,your chemical environment internally is being controlled 
457.27,"by external chemicals, "
459.16,"your nervous system, and your hormones, and your metabolism "
462.37,"are being modified by things in your environment, "
466.2,so we're going to talk about those. 
468.08,"It's an absolutely fascinating aspect to our biology, "
471.35,"it's one of our most primordial, "
474.09,"meaning primitive aspects of our biology, "
476.45,but it's still very active in all of us today. 
480.56,"This episode, believe it or not, "
481.74,"will have a lot of tools, a lot of protocols. "
485.66,Even though I'm guessing most of you 
487.32,"can probably smell your environment just fine, "
490.22,"that you know what you like to eat and what tastes good, "
492.42,"and what doesn't taste good to you, "
494.87,today's episode is going to talk about tools 
496.77,that will allow you to actually leverage 
499.55,"these chemical sensing mechanisms, "
501.3,including how you smell 
503.61,"not how you smell in the qualitative sense, "
506.007,"but how you smell in the verb sense, "
508.21,the action of sniffing and smelling 
510.93,to enhance your sense of smell 
513.31,"and to enhance your sense of taste as well, "
516.55,"believe it or not, to enhance your cognition, "
519.01,your ability to learn and remember things. 
521.56,Everything we're going to talk about as always 
523.27,is grounded in quality peer-reviewed studies 
525.63,"from some excellent laboratories, "
527.51,"I'll provide some resources along the way, "
529.44,so that means tools and protocols 
531.1,and also basic information. 
531.933,You're going to learn a ton of neuroscience 
534.68,and lot of biology in general. 
536.81,And I think what you'll come to realize by the end 
539.16,is that while we are clearly different 
541.3,"from the other animals, "
542.77,there are aspects to our biology that are very similar 
546.74,to that of other animals in very interesting ways. 
550.43,"Before we dive into chemical sensing, "
552.66,I want to just briefly touch on a few things 
554.62,from the vision episode. 
556.39,One is a summary of a protocol. 
559.02,"So, I covered "
13,"protocols last episode, "
561.93,"if you haven't seen that episode, check it out. "
564.05,Those protocols will allow you to be more alert 
566.57,and to see better over time if you follow them. 
569.01,"All of them are zero cost, "
570.12,"you can find any and all of them at hubermanlab.com, "
573.35,"there's a link to those videos and tools and protocols, "
576.61,everything is timestamped. 
579.33,The two protocols that I just want to remind everybody of 
583.69,are the protocol of near-far viewing that all of us 
588.67,"regardless of age, should probably spend about five minutes "
593.11,"three times a week, doing some near-far viewing exercises. "
596.77,"So, that would be bringing a pen or pencil "
598.78,"up close to the point where you're about to cross your eyes, "
601.42,but you don't cross your eyes 
603.13,and then out at some distance. 
604.84,And then look beyond that pen 
606.58,or other object that you're using 
609.28,off as far as you can into the distance. 
611.12,It would be great if you could do this on a balcony or deck 
613.28,and then look way off in the distance 
614.9,and then bring it back in. 
616.15,"This is going to exercise that accommodation reflex, "
619.08,the change in the shape of the lens 
621.01,can help offset a number of things 
623.33,"including myopia, near-sightedness. "
625.76,The other one is this incredible study 
628.62,"that showed that two hours a day outside, "
631.67,even if you're doing other things while you're outside 
634.18,"can help offset myopia, nearsightedness. "
637.3,"So, try and get outside, "
638.7,"it's really the sunlight and the blue light, right? "
640.92,"Everyone's been demonizing blue light out there, "
642.66,but blue light is great 
643.96,"provided it's not super, super bright "
646.73,and really close to your eyes. 
648.18,Blue is terrific if it comes from sunlight. 
651.07,Two hours a day outside 
652.39,"is going to help offset myopia, nearsightedness. "
655.39,"Now, that's a lot of time, "
656.39,"I think most of us are not getting that time, "
658.56,"but since you can do other things like gardening, "
660.84,"or reading, or walking, or running. "
663.17,If you can get that two hours outside 
664.77,your visual system and your brain will benefit. 
668.08,I also would like to make one brief correction 
671.19,to something that I said incorrectly 
673.38,in the previous episode. 
675.1,"At the end of the episode, I talked about lutein, "
678.52,and how lutein may help offset 
681.6,some moderate to severe age-related macular degeneration. 
685.49,"As well, I talked about how some people "
686.91,are supplementing with lutein 
688.55,even though they don't have age-related macular degeneration 
691.75,with the idea in mind 
692.8,that it might help offset some vision loss 
695.21,as they get older. 
696.78,"I said lutein, and lutein was the correct thing to say, "
700.31,"but once or twice, when I started speaking fast "
703.97,I said leucine and not lutein. 
707.48,"I want to emphasize that leucine, "
709.79,"an amino acid, very interesting, "
711.56,"important for muscle building covered in previous episodes, "
714.55,"but lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N, "
719.25,is the molecule and compound that I was referring to 
721.91,in terms of supplementing for sake of vision. 
724.54,"So I apologize, please forgive me I misspoke, "
727.56,"a couple of you caught that right away, "
729.96,in listening to the episode after it went up 
731.86,I realized that I had misspoken. 
733.67,"So, lutein for vision, "
735.53,"leucine for muscles, and muscle growth, "
738.55,"and strength, et cetera. "
740.16,"Before we dive into the content of today's episode, "
743.08,I want to just briefly touch on color vision. 
745.84,Many of you asked questions about color vision 
748.42,and color perception. 
749.85,And indeed color perception is a fascinating aspect 
753.28,"of the human visual system, "
755.12,it's one of the things that makes us unique. 
757.18,There are certainly other animals out there 
759.4,"that can detect all the colors of the rainbow, "
761.56,"some can even detect into the infrared, into the far-red "
765.86,"that we can't see, "
767.44,"but nonetheless, human color vision, "
769.19,"provided that somebody isn't colorblind, "
771.19,is really remarkable. 
773.1,And if you're interested in color vision 
775.2,or you want to answer questions 
776.9,about art or about for instance 
779.63,why that dress that showed up online a few years ago 
782.59,looks blue to you and yellow to somebody else. 
785.2,All the answers to that are in this terrific book 
788.01,"which is ""What Is Color?: "
789.69,
50,"Questions and Answers on the Science of Color"". "
792.48,"I did not write this book, I wish I had, "
794.87,"the book is by Arielle and Joann Eckstut, "
797.63,that E-C-K-S-T-U-T. 
800.42,"So, it's ""What Is Color?: "
801.8,
50,"Questions and Answers on the Science of Color"". "
805.65,"It's an absolutely fabulous book, "
807.13,I've no business relationship to them. 
809.24,I did help them get in contact 
811.33,with some color vision scientists 
812.9,when they reached out to me. 
814.33,And you can know that all the information in the book 
816.3,was vetted by excellent color vision scientists. 
819.21,"It's a really wonderful and beautiful book, "
821.12,the illustrations are beautiful. 
822.63,"If you're somebody who's interested in design or art, "
826.32,"or you're just curious about the science of color, "
828.4,"it's a terrific book, I highly recommend it. "
830.43,"If you just look it up online, "
831.88,there are a variety of places 
833.27,that will allow you to access the book. 
835.24,"So, let's talk about sensing chemicals "
837.43,and how chemicals control us. 
840.44,"In our environment, "
841.44,there are a lot of different physical stimuli. 
844.75,"There is light, "
846.23,"photons, which are light energy "
849.05,and those land on your retinas 
851.55,"and your retinas tell your brain about them, "
854.06,and your brain creates this thing we call vision. 
856.94,"There are sound waves, "
858.03,literally particles moving through the air 
860.68,and reverberations that create 
863.13,what we call sound and hearing. 
865.57,"And of course there are mechanical stimuli, "
869.31,"pressure, light touch, scratch, "
873.37,"tickle, et cetera, that lands on our skin "
875.77,or the blowing of a breeze 
877.07,"that deflects the hairs on our skin, "
879.44,"and we can sense mechanical touch, mechanical sensation. "
884.63,"And there are chemicals, "
886.21,there are things floating around in the environment 
889.88,which we call volatile chemicals. 
892.65,"So, volatile sounds oftentimes like emotionally volatile, "
895.9,but it just means that they're floating around out there. 
898.41,"So, when you actually smell something "
901.03,like let's say you smell 
902.76,a wonderfully smelling rose or cake. 
905.77,"Yes, you are inhaling the particles into your nose, "
910.0,they're literally little particles 
911.57,of those chemicals are going up into your nose 
914.25,and being detected by your brain. 
918.16,"Also, if you smell something putrid, "
920.35,"disgusting, or awful, use your imagination, "
923.89,those particles are going up into your nose 
926.78,and being detected by neurons that are part of your brain. 
931.7,Other ways of getting chemicals into our system 
934.46,"is by putting them in our mouth, "
937.46,"by literally taking foods and chewing them, "
941.55,or sucking on them and breaking them down 
943.81,"into their component parts, "
945.44,and that's one way that we sense chemicals 
947.35,"with this thing, our tongue. "
950.05,And there are chemicals that can enter 
953.14,through other mucosal linings 
955.65,"and other kind of just think damp, "
958.07,sticky linings of your body. 
960.39,"And the main ones would be the eyes, "
962.81,"so you've got your nose, your eyes and your mouth. "
964.9,But mainly when we have chemicals coming into our system 
967.64,it's through our nose or through our mouth. 
970.32,"Although, sometimes through our skin "
972.88,"certain things can go transdermal, not many, "
975.27,and through our eyes. 
977.09,"So these chemicals, "
979.44,"we sometimes bring into our body, into our biology, "
983.37,through deliberate action. 
984.93,"We select a food, we chew that food, "
987.81,and we do it intentionally. 
988.96,Sometimes they're coming into our body 
991.14,through non-deliberate action. 
992.86,"We enter an environment, "
994.49,"and there's smoke and we smell the smoke, "
996.56,and as a consequence we take action. 
999.3,Sometimes we are forced to eat something 
1001.5,because somebody tells us we should eat it 
1003.31,or we do it to be polite. 
1004.82,"So, there are all these ways "
1005.653,that chemicals can make it into our body. 
1008.52,"Sometimes however, other people "
1010.84,"are actively making chemicals with their body, "
1013.77,"typically this would be with their breath, "
1016.55,"with their tears, "
1018.33,"or possibly, I want to underscore possibly, "
1021.83,"by making what are called pheromones, "
1023.53,molecules that they release into the environment 
1025.59,typically through the breath 
1027.73,"that enter our system through our nose, "
1030.37,"or our eyes, or our mouth "
1032.07,that fundamentally change our biology. 
1036.02,I will explain how smell and taste 
1038.4,"and these pheromone effects work, "
1040.84,"but I'll just give an example, "
1042.31,which is a very salient and interesting one 
1045.46,that was published about 
10,years ago 
1047.47,in the Journal Science. 
1049.0,Science Magazine is one of the three 
1050.83,what we call apex journals. 
1053.09,"There are a lot of journals out there, "
1054.41,"but for those of you that want to know, "
1055.81,"Science Magazine, Nature Magazine, and Cell "
1060.39,"are considered the three top kind of apex journals, "
1063.59,they are the most stringent 
1065.0,"in terms of getting papers accepted, "
1067.76,they're even reviewed there. 
1068.73,They have about a 
95%,"rejection rate at the front gate, "
1073.41,meaning they don't even review 
95%,
1075.37,of what gets sent to them. 
1076.68,Of the things that they do decide to review 
1079.17,"then get sent out, "
1080.3,"a very small percentage of those get published, "
1082.51,it's very stringent. 
1083.8,This paper came out in Science 
1086.49,"showing that humans, men in particular in this study, "
1090.35,have a strong biological response and hormonal response 
1094.46,to the tears of women. 
1098.31,"What they did is they had women, "
1100.79,"and in this case it was only women for whatever reason, "
1104.5,cry and they collected their tears. 
1108.47,"Then those tears were smelled by male subjects, "
1112.12,"or male subjects got what was essentially the control, "
1116.59,which was the saline. 
1118.27,Men that smelled these tears that were evoked by sadness 
1124.25,had a reduction in their testosterone levels 
1126.53,that was significant. 
1128.21,They also had a reduction in brain areas 
1130.77,that were associated with sexual arousal. 
1133.59,"Now, before you run off with your interpretations "
1136.36,about what this means and criticize the study 
1138.44,"for any variety of reasons, let's just take a step back. "
1142.21,I will criticize the study for a variety of reasons too. 
1145.21,"One is that they only used female tiers and male subjects, "
1149.55,so it would have been nice for them to also use female tears 
1153.45,"and female subjects smelling those, "
1156.1,"male tears and male subjects smelling those, "
1158.8,"male tears and female subjects smelling those, and so on. "
1162.29,"They didn't do that, "
1163.45,"they did have a large number of subjects, "
1164.94,"so that's good, that adds power to the study. "
1168.11,And they did have to collect these tears 
1171.28,by having the women watch what was essentially 
1173.73,a sad scene from a movie. 
1175.42,They actually recruited subjects that had a high propensity 
1177.96,"for crying at sad movies, which was not all women. "
1181.6,It turns out that the people that they recruited 
1183.12,"for the study were people who said, ""Yes, "
1185.27,"I tend to cry when I see sad things in movies."" "
1188.43,What they're really trying to do 
1189.263,is get just get tears that were authentically cried 
1193.43,"in response to sadness, "
1195.25,as opposed to putting some irritant in the eye 
1198.42,and collecting tears that were evoked by something else 
1202.21,like just having the eyes irritated. 
1204.78,"Nonetheless, what this study illustrates "
1208.36,is that there are chemicals in tears 
1211.75,that are evoking or changing the biology 
1214.5,of other individuals. 
1216.56,"Now, most of us don't think about sniffing "
1218.74,"or smelling other people's tears, "
1220.94,"but you can imagine how in close couples, "
1224.11,"or in family members, "
1225.2,"or even close friendships, et cetera, "
1227.73,that we are often in close proximity 
1229.78,to other people's tears. 
1231.59,"Now, I didn't select this study as an example "
1234.14,because I want to focus on the effects 
1236.11,"of tears on hormones, per se, "
1238.24,although I do find the results really interesting. 
1240.86,I chose it because I wanted to just emphasize 
1244.36,or underscore the fact 
1245.71,that chemicals that are made by other individuals 
1248.67,"are powerfully modulating our internal state, "
1252.76,and that's something that most of us don't appreciate. 
1256.33,I think most of us can appreciate the fact 
1258.54,"that if we smell something putrid, we tend to retract, "
1261.1,"or if we smell something delicious, we tend to lean into it. "
1264.77,But there are all these ways in which chemicals 
1266.79,"are affecting our biology, "
1268.35,and interpersonal communication using chemicals 
1272.65,"is not something that we hear that often about, "
1275.56,but it's super interesting. 
1276.91,"So, let's talk about smell "
1278.25,and what smell is and how it works. 
1280.34,"I'm going to make this very basic, "
1281.94,but I am going to touch on some of the core elements 
1284.09,of the neurobiology. 
1285.55,"So, here's how smell works. "
1287.69,Smell starts with sniffing. 
1290.61,"Now, that may come as no surprise, "
1292.24,but no volatile chemicals can enter our nose 
1296.21,unless we inhale them. 
1297.66,"If our nose is occluded, or if we're actively exhaling "
1301.93,"it's much more difficult for smells to enter our nose, "
1305.27,which is why people cover their nose 
1306.7,when something smells bad. 
1309.42,"Now, the way that these volatile odors "
1312.44,come into the nose is interesting. 
1314.18,"The nose has a mucosal lining, "
1316.44,"mucus that is designed to trap things, "
1319.19,to actually bring things in and get stuck there. 
1323.13,"At the base of your brain, "
1324.54,so you could actually imagine this 
1326.63,"or if you wanted, you could touch the roof of your mouth. "
1328.927,"So, right above the roof of the mouth, "
1331.18,about two centimeters is your olfactory bulb. 
1334.54,The olfactory bulb is a collection of neurons 
1336.66,"and those neurons actually extend out of the skull, "
1340.41,out of your skull into your nose 
1343.1,into the mucosal lining. 
1344.76,"So, what this means in kind of a literal sense "
1347.37,is that you have neurons that extend 
1350.09,"their little dendrites and axon-like things, "
1353.36,"they're little processes as we call them, "
1355.33,"out into the mucus, "
1357.33,and they respond to different odorant compounds. 
1361.17,"Now, the olfactory neurons "
1363.09,also send a branch deeper into the brain 
1366.22,and they split off into three different paths. 
1370.93,"So, one path is for what we call innate odor responses, "
1376.29,so you have some hard wired aspects 
1379.26,to the way that you smell the world 
1381.13,that were there from the day you were born 
1383.16,and that will be there until the day you die. 
1385.91,These are the pathways and the neurons that respond 
1389.73,"to things like smoke, "
1392.21,which as you can imagine there's a highly adaptive function 
1395.47,to being able to detect burning things 
1397.73,because burning things generally means lack of safety 
1400.86,or impending threat of some kind. 
1404.12,"It calls for action, "
1405.67,and indeed these neurons project 
1407.57,"to the central area of the brain called the amygdala, "
1410.21,"which is often discussed in terms of fear, "
1412.1,but it's really fear and threat detection. 
1414.98,"So some compounds, some chemicals in your environment "
1417.66,"when you smell them, unless you're trained to overcome them "
1420.93,because you're a firefighter 
1422.75,"you will naturally have a heightened level of alertness, "
1426.96,"you will sense threat, "
1429.03,"and if you're in sleep, even it will wake you up. "
1432.09,"All right, so that's a good thing, "
1432.99,it's kind of an emergency system. 
1435.18,You also have neurons in your nose 
1437.72,that respond to odorants 
1439.16,or combinations of odorants that evoke a sense of desire 
1444.13,"and what we call appetitive behaviors, approach behaviors, "
1447.53,that make you want to move toward something. 
1449.7,"So, when you smell a delicious cookie, "
1452.69,"or some dish that's really savory that you really like, "
1457.39,"or a wonderful orange, "
1460.22,"and you say, ""Mmm,"" "
1461.8,"or it feels delicious, or it smells delicious "
1465.33,"that's because of these innate pathway, "
1467.22,these pathways that require no learning whatsoever. 
1470.66,"Now, some of the pathways from the nose, "
1473.25,these olfactory neurons into the brain 
1475.21,are involved in learned associations with odors. 
1479.28,Many people have this experience 
1482.97,that they can remember the smell 
1486.73,"of their grandmother's home, "
1488.56,"or their grandmother's hands even, "
1491.14,"or the smell of particular items baking, "
1494.56,or on the stove in a particular environment. 
1498.87,"Typically, these memories tend to be of a kind of nurturing "
1501.85,sort of feeling safe and protected. 
1504.49,But one of the reasons why olfaction smell 
1508.37,is so closely tied to memory 
1510.31,"is because olfaction is the most ancient sense that we have, "
1513.88,or I should say chemical sensing is among the most primitive 
1517.27,"and ancient senses that we have, "
1519.4,probably almost certainly evolved 
1521.11,before vision and before hearing. 
1524.14,But when we come into the world 
1527.01,because we're still learning about the statistics of life 
1530.03,"about who's friendly and who's not friendly, "
1532.41,and where's a fun place to be 
1533.83,"and where's a boring place to be, "
1535.89,that all takes a long time to learn. 
1537.6,"But the olfactory system seems to imprint, "
1540.72,seems to lay down memories very early 
1543.9,and create these very powerful associations. 
1547.38,And if you think about it long enough and hard enough 
1551.12,many of you can probably realize 
1554.17,that there are certain smells that evoke a memory 
1557.54,"of a particular place, or person, or context. "
1560.8,And that's because you also have pathways out of the nose 
1563.87,"that are not for innate behaviors like cringing, "
1566.93,"or repulsion, or gagging, "
1570.85,"or for that appetitive mmm sensation, "
1573.41,"but that just remind you of a place, "
1575.62,"or a thing, or a context, "
1577.43,"could be flowers in spring, "
1579.27,could be grandmother's home and cookies. 
1582.14,"This is a very common occurrence, "
1584.62,and it's a very common occurrence 
1585.96,because this generally exists in all of us. 
1588.34,"So, we have pathway for innate responses "
1591.73,and a pathway for learned responses. 
1593.62,"And then we have this other pathway, "
1596.09,and in humans it's a little bit controversial 
1598.12,as to whether or not it sits truly separate 
1600.41,from the standard olfactory system 
1602.89,"or whether or not it's its own system embedded in there, "
1606.46,but that they call the accessory olfactory pathway. 
1610.47,Accessory olfactory pathway is what in other animals 
1613.72,is responsible for true pheromone effects. 
1617.01,"We will talk about true pheromone effects, "
1619.14,but for example in rodents 
1622.47,"and in some primates, including mandrills. "
1625.99,"If you've ever seen a mandrill, "
1626.89,"they have these like big beak noses things, "
1629.04,"you may have seen them at the zoo, "
1629.97,"look them up if you haven't seen them already, "
1631.54,M-A-N-D-R-I-L-S 
1633.93,"mandrills, there are strong pheromone effects. "
1637.32,Some of those include things like 
1640.16,"if you take a pregnant female rodent or mandrill, "
1644.91,you take away the father that created those 
1649.48,"fetuses or fetus, "
1651.96,and you introduce the scent of the urine 
1656.1,"or the fur of a novel male, "
1659.88,"she will spontaneously abort or miscarry those fetuses, "
1663.457,it's a very powerful effect. 
1666.63,"In humans, it's still controversial "
1668.4,"whether or not anything like that can happen, "
1670.47,but it's a very powerful pheromonal effect in other animals. 
1673.6,Another example of a pheromone effect 
1676.05,is called the Vandenbergh effect 
1677.56,"named after the person who discovered this effect, "
1680.15,where you take a female 
1682.97,"of a given species that has not entered puberty, "
1686.2,you expose her to the scent or the urine 
1690.04,"from a sexually competent, meaning post-pubertal male, "
1694.85,and she spontaneously goes into puberty earlier. 
1698.78,"So, something about the scent "
1699.96,"triggers something through this accessory olfactory system, "
1703.2,this is a true pheromonal effect 
1705.12,"and creates ovulation, right and menstruation. "
1708.88,"Or in rodents it's an estrous cycle, not a menstrual cycle. "
1712.38,"So, this is not to say that the exact same things "
1716.43,happen in humans. 
1717.263,"In humans, as I mentioned earlier, "
1719.1,there are chemical sensing between individuals 
1721.52,that may be independent of the nose. 
1724.55,"And we will talk about those, "
1726.24,but those are basically the three paths 
1728.32,"by which smells, odors impact us. "
1731.84,"So, I want to talk about the act of smelling, "
1734.99,"and if you are not somebody who is very interested in smell, "
1738.83,but you are somebody who is interested 
1740.37,"in making your brain work better, "
1742.23,"learning faster, remembering more things, "
1744.83,this next little segment is for you 
1747.02,"because it turns out that how you smell, "
1749.78,"meaning the act of smelling, not how good or bad you smell, "
1752.81,"but the act of smelling, "
1755.92,"sniffing, and inhalation powerfully impacts "
1758.79,how your brain functions 
1760.24,and what you can learn and what you can't learn. 
1762.97,"Breathing generally consists of two actions, "
1765.74,"inhaling and exhaling, "
1767.69,and we have the option of course 
1769.02,to do that through our nose or our mouth. 
1772.26,I've talked on previous episodes about the fact 
1774.28,"that there are great advantages to being a nasal breather, "
1778.31,and there are a great disadvantages 
1780.04,to being a mouth breather. 
1782.25,"There are excellent books and data on this, "
1785.23,"there's the recent book ""Breath"" by James Nestor, "
1787.76,which is an excellent book 
1789.41,that describes some of the positive effects 
1791.64,of nasal breathing as well as other breathing practices. 
1794.52,"There's also the book ""Jaws"" by my colleagues, "
1797.19,"Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn, "
1798.62,with a foreword by Jared Diamond 
1801.05,and an introduction by Robert Sapolsky from Stanford. 
1805.03,"So, that's a book chockablock "
1806.81,with heavy hitter authors that describes 
1809.58,"how being a nasal breather is beneficial for jaw structure, "
1814.21,"for immune system function, et cetera "
1817.71,"Breathing in through your nose, "
1820.31,sniffing actually has positive effects 
1823.43,on the way that you can acquire and remember information. 
1828.1,Noam Sobel's group originally at UC Berkeley 
1831.37,and then at the Weizmann Institute 
1833.78,has published a number of papers 
1836.69,that I'd like to discuss today. 
1838.39,"One of them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition "
1842.31,"Phase-Locked with Inhalation, "
1843.73,"this was published in Nature Human Behavior, "
1845.68,an excellent journal. 
1848.01,Showed that the act of inhaling 
1851.017,[Andrew inhales deeply] 
1852.05,has a couple of interesting and powerful consequences. 
1855.4,"First of all, as we inhale "
1858.11,"the brain increases in arousal, "
1861.41,our level of alertness and attention increases 
1863.96,when we inhale as compared to when we exhale. 
1867.14,"Now, of course with every inhale, there's an exhale, "
1870.05,you could probably double up on your inhales 
1871.93,"if you're doing size or something, "
1873.34,"physiological size I've talked about these before, "
1875.23,so double inhales [inhales twice] 
1876.4,"followed by an exhale [exhales], "
1877.96,something like that. 
1878.86,"Or if you're speaking, you're going to change your cadence "
1881.29,"and ratio of inhales and exhales, "
1882.67,"but typically we inhale, then we exhale. "
1886.36,"As we inhale, what this paper shows "
1889.53,"is that the level of alertness goes up in the brain, "
1894.04,and this makes sense because as the most primitive 
1897.3,and primordial sense by which we interact 
1900.5,with our environment and bring chemicals into our system 
1904.43,"and detect our environment, "
1906.53,inhaling is a cue for the rest of the brain 
1910.8,"to essentially to pay attention to what's happening, "
1914.31,not just to the odors 
1915.54,"as the name of this paper suggests, "
1917.92,Human Non-Olfactory Cognition Phase-Locked with Inhalation. 
1922.91,What that means is that the act of inhaling itself 
1927.1,"wakes up the brain, "
1928.22,it's not about what you're perceiving 
1930.3,or what you're smelling. 
1932.37,"And indeed sniffing as an action, "
1935.01,inhaling as an action has a powerful effect 
1938.06,"on your ability to be alert, "
1940.71,"your ability to attend, to focus, "
1943.2,and your ability to remember information. 
1946.05,"When we exhale, the brain goes through a subtle, "
1950.25,but nonetheless significant dip 
1952.46,in level of arousal and ability to learn. 
1955.87,"So, what does this mean? "
1957.3,How should you use this knowledge? 
1959.45,"Well, you could imagine, "
1961.86,and I think this will be beneficial for most people 
1964.75,to focus on nasal breathing 
1966.82,while doing any kind of focused work that doesn't require 
1970.18,"that you speak, or eat, or ingest something. "
1973.53,There's a separate paper published 
1974.94,in the journal of neuroscience that showed 
1977.24,"that indeed if subjects, human subjects, "
1979.41,"are restricted to breathing through their nose, "
1982.53,they learn better than if they have the option 
1985.92,"of breathing through their mouth, "
1987.62,or a combination of their nose and mouth. 
1989.63,These are significant effects 
1990.88,in humans using modern techniques from excellent groups. 
1994.43,"So, sniffing itself is a powerful modulator "
1998.21,of our cognition and our ability to learn. 
2002.14,You can imagine all sorts of ways 
2003.32,that you might apply that as a tool. 
2005.23,And I suggest that you play with it a bit 
2007.4,"that if you're having a hard time staying awake and alert, "
2010.47,"you're having a hard time remembering information, "
2012.46,"you feel like you have a kind of attention deficit, "
2014.55,"nonclinical of course, "
2016.33,"nasal breathing ought to help, "
2018.03,extending or making your inhales more intense ought to help. 
2023.11,"Now, this isn't really about chemical sensing per se, "
2025.94,but here's where it gets interesting and exciting. 
2029.02,If you are somebody 
2029.91,"who doesn't have a very good sense of smell, "
2033.05,or you're somebody who simply wants to get better 
2035.37,"at smelling and tasting things, "
2038.24,you can actually practice sniffing. 
2040.88,"I know that sounds ridiculous, "
2042.13,but it turns out that simply sniffing nothing. 
2045.56,"So, doing something like this. "
2046.835,[Andrew sniffs deeply] 
2048.59,"I guess the microphone sort of has a smell [sniffs], "
2050.51,I guess my pen doesn't have a smell. 
2052.42,[Andrew sniffs deeply] 
2054.06,"It turns out that doing a series of inhales, "
2056.7,"and of course each one is followed by an exhale, "
2058.83,
10,or 
15,times and then smelling an object 
2062.73,"like an orange or another item of food, "
2066.089,or even the skin of somebody else 
2067.99,will lead to an increase in your ability 
2071.28,to perceive those odors. 
2073.94,"Now, there are probably two reasons for that. "
2076.45,One reason is that the brain systems 
2078.64,of detecting things are waking up 
2080.19,as a mere consequence of inhaling. 
2082.24,"Okay, so this is sort of the olfactory equivalent "
2085.47,"of opening your eyes wider in order to see, more or less. "
2089.79,"Okay, last episode I talked about "
2091.07,how opening your eyes wider 
2092.13,"actually increases your level of alertness, "
2094.1,it's not just that your level of alertness 
2095.71,causes your eyes to be open wider. 
2098.04,Opening your eyes wider 
2098.9,can actually increase your level of alertness. 
2100.8,"Well, it turns out that breathing more deeply "
2102.37,"through the nose, wakes up your brain "
2104.7,and it creates a heightened sensitivity 
2108.47,of the neurons that relate to smell. 
2111.87,"And there's a close crossover, "
2114.01,"I'm sure you know this, between smell and taste. "
2116.27,If any of you have ever had a cold 
2118.16,or you have for whatever reason 
2119.7,"you've lost your sense of smell, "
2121.07,"you become what they call anosmic, "
2122.61,your sense of taste suffers also. 
2124.55,We'll talk a little bit more 
2125.5,"about why that is in a few minutes, "
2127.56,"but as a first protocol, "
2128.96,I'd really like all of you to consider 
2131.66,becoming nasal breathers 
2133.07,"while you're trying to learn, while you're trying to listen, "
2136.11,while you're trying to wake up your brain in any way 
2139.73,"and learn and retain information, "
2142.63,this is a powerful tool. 
2144.9,"Now, there are other ways "
2145.79,to wake up your brain more as well. 
2147.99,"For instance, the use of smelling salts. "
2150.48,"I'm not recommending that you do this necessarily, "
2152.46,but there are excellent peer reviewed data 
2155.25,"showing that indeed, if you use smelling salts, "
2158.9,"which are mostly of the sort that include ammonia, "
2162.77,"ammonia is a very toxic scent, "
2165.87,"but it's toxic in a way that triggers this innate pathway, "
2170.18,"the pathway from the nose to the amygdala, "
2172.17,and wakes up the brain and body in a major way. 
2174.77,This is why they use smelling salts 
2176.01,"when people pass out, "
2177.08,this is why fighters used to use 
2179.71,or maybe sometimes still use smelling salts 
2182.64,"in order to heighten their level of alertness, "
2184.25,this is why powerlifters will inhale smelling salts. 
2188.18,They work because they trigger the fear 
2191.63,"and kind of overall arousal systems of the brain, "
2194.32,this is why I think most people probably shouldn't 
2195.97,"use ammonia or smelling salts to try and wake up, "
2198.28,but they really do work. 
2200.15,If you've ever smelled smelling salts 
2201.63,"and I have, I tried this, "
2203.45,"they give you a serious jolt, "
2205.71,it's like six espresso 
2207.55,"infused into your bloodstream all at once, "
2209.42,you are wide awake immediately 
2211.61,and you feel a heightened sense of kind of desire to move 
2214.86,because you release adrenaline into your body. 
2217.29,"Now, inhaling through your nose "
2218.78,"and doing nasal breathing is not going to do that, "
2220.8,it's going to be a more subtle version of waking up your system 
2224.95,of alerting your brain overall. 
2227.68,"And for those of you that are interested in having a richer, "
2231.76,a more deep connection 
2234.26,"to the things that you smell and taste, "
2236.3,"including other individuals perhaps not just food, "
2241.1,"practicing or enhancing your sense of sniffing, "
2243.43,your ability to sniff 
2244.51,"might sound like a kind of ridiculous protocol, "
2246.53,but it's actually a kind of fun and cool experiment 
2249.21,that you can do. 
2250.043,You just do the simple experiment of taking for instance 
2252.58,"an orange, you smell it, "
2254.15,try and gauge your level of perception 
2256.95,"of how orange-ish it smells, "
2259.01,"or lemony, lemonish, lemony, I don't know "
2261.83,is it lemonish or lemony? 
2263.83,"Lemony it smells, then set it away, "
2268.21,do 
10,or 
15,inhales 
2270.211,[Andrew inhales and exhales] 
2271.44,"followed by exhales of course, "
2272.61,or just through the nose. 
2273.629,[Andrew breaths rapidly] 
2274.636,I'm not going to do all 
10,or 
15.,
2276.01,"And then smell it again, "
2277.25,"and you'll notice that your perception of that smell, "
2279.367,the kind of richness of that smell 
2281.81,will be significantly increased. 
2283.81,"And that's again, for two reasons, "
2285.42,"one, the brain is in a position to respond to it better, "
2289.28,"your brain has been aroused by the mere act of sniffing, "
2292.43,but also the neurons that respond 
2294.66,"to that lemon odor, that lemony or odor "
2298.31,are going to respond better. 
2299.88,"So, you can actually have a heightened experience "
2302.59,"of something, and that of course will also be true "
2304.89,for the taste system. 
2306.04,You also can really train your sense of smell 
2308.69,"to get much, much better. "
2310.52,When Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley 
2312.17,"I happened to be a graduate student around that time, "
2314.75,and every once in a while I'd look outside 
2317.35,and there would be people crawling around on the grass 
2320.74,"with goggles on, gloves on, "
2322.59,and these hoods on with earmuffs. 
2325.47,"And they looked ridiculous, "
2327.47,but what they were doing is they were actually 
2329.14,learning to follow scent trails. 
2331.92,"So, in the world of dogs "
2333.45,you have sight hounds that use their eyes 
2335.52,"in order to navigate and find things, "
2337.73,and you have scent towns that use their nose. 
2339.48,"And the scent hounds are remarkable, "
2340.89,they can be trained to detect a scent. 
2342.92,"These are the sniffing, "
2344.39,"you know, the bomb sniffing "
2345.223,and the drug sniffing dogs in airports. 
2348.27,There are now dogs actually that can sniff 
2350.63,"out COVID infections with a very high degree of accuracy, "
2354.19,they can be trained to do that. 
2355.43,There's something about the COVID 
2357.94,and similar infections that the body produces 
2360.58,"probably in the immune response, "
2362.1,some odors and the dogs are I think as high as 
90%,
2365.39,"in some cases, maybe even "
95%,"accuracy, "
2367.96,just remarkable. 
2369.14,"There are theories that dogs can sniff out cancer, "
2371.87,this stuff all exceeds statistical significance. 
2374.72,"It's still a little bit mysterious in some ways, "
2376.81,but you may not ever achieve 
2379.95,"the olfactory capabilities of a scent hound, "
2383.26,but what Noam Sobel's lab did is they had people 
2388.12,completely eliminate their visual experience 
2390.33,"by having them wear dark glasses or goggles, "
2393.21,"so they couldn't see, and they couldn't hear, "
2394.61,"they couldn't sense anything with their sense of touch, "
2396.66,they had thick gloves on. 
2398.05,But they had these masks on 
2399.83,where just their nasal passages were open 
2402.17,and people could in a fairly short amount of time 
2405.95,"learn to follow a chocolate scent trail on the ground, "
2409.89,"which is not something that most people want to do, "
2412.55,"but what they showed using brain imaging, et cetera "
2415.22,"in subsequent studies is that the human brain, "
2419.36,you can learn to really enhance your sense of smell 
2423.09,and become very astute in distinguishing 
2425.93,whether or not one particular odor 
2427.86,or combinations of odors 
2429.18,"is such that it's less than, "
2432.52,or more than a different odor for instance. 
2435.19,"Now, why would you want to do this? "
2436.27,"Well, if you like to eat as much as I do, "
2439.43,one of the things 
2440.263,that can really enhance your sense of pleasure 
2443.53,from the experience of ingesting food 
2445.66,is to enhance your sense of smell. 
2447.57,"And if you don't have a great sense of smell, "
2450.27,or if you have a sense of smell 
2451.67,"that's really so good that it's always picking up bad odors, "
2455.19,we'll talk about that in a minute. 
2457.27,"Well, then you might want to tune up your sense of smell "
2461.73,by doing this practice of 
10,or 
15,"breaths, "
2465.0,"excuse me, sniffs, not breaths, "
2466.66,sniffs and then interacting with some food item 
2470.45,or thing that you're interested in smelling more of. 
2472.48,"So, these could be the ingredients that you're cooking with, "
2474.29,I really encourage you to try and really smell them. 
2476.67,You sometimes hear this 
2477.61,as kind of a mindfulness practice 
2478.93,"like ooh, really smell the food, really taste the food. "
2481.967,And we always hear about that 
2483.19,"as kind of a mindfulness and presence thing, "
2485.84,but you actually can increase the sensitivity 
2488.1,of your olfactory and your taste system by doing this. 
2490.91,"And it has long-term effects, "
2493.16,that's what's so interesting. 
2494.32,This isn't the kind of thing 
2495.153,that you have to do every time you eat. 
2496.66,You don't have to be the weirdo in the restaurant 
2498.18,that's like picking up the radish 
2499.84,"and like jamming it up your nostrils, please don't do that. "
2502.71,"You don't have to necessarily smell everything, "
2504.78,although it's nice sometimes to smell the food 
2507.81,"that you're about to eat and as you eat it, "
2509.66,but it has long-term effects 
2511.07,in terms of your ability to distinguish 
2513.67,and discriminate different types of odors. 
2516.63,And these don't even have to be very pungent foods 
2518.89,"it turns out, "
2519.723,the studies show that doesn't have 
2521.05,"to be some really stinky cheese, "
2522.65,"you know, there are cheese shops "
2524.05,"that I've walked into where like I just basically gag, "
2526.23,"I can't handle it, I just can't be in there, "
2528.315,it just overwhelms me. 
2529.91,"Other people, they love that smell. "
2531.9,"So, you have to tune it to your interest and experience, "
2534.38,"but I think even for you fasters out there, "
2537.21,"everybody eats at some point, "
2539.4,everybody ingests chemicals through their mouth. 
2541.817,And one of the ways that you can powerfully increase 
2545.18,your relationship to that experience 
2547.24,and make it much more positive 
2549.56,is through just the occasional practice 
2551.77,of 
10,or 
15,"sniffs of nothing, "
2555.21,which almost sounds ridiculous like how could that be? 
2557.93,"But now, you understand why, "
2559.21,it's because of the way that the sniffing action increases 
2561.68,the alertness of the brain 
2563.07,as well as increasing the sensitivity of the system. 
2566.47,No other system that I'm aware of in our body 
2570.0,is as amenable to these kinds of behavioral training shifts 
2574.3,and allow them to happen so quickly. 
2576.07,I would love to be able to tell you 
2577.7,that just doing 
10,or 
15,near-far exercises with a pen 
2581.14,or going outside for 
10,or 
15,seconds each morning 
2584.43,is going to completely change 
2585.94,the way that you see the world. 
2586.87,"But it actually isn't the case, "
2588.27,"you actually, it requires more training, "
2590.06,a little bit more effort in the visual system. 
2591.99,"In the olfactory system, "
2593.247,"and your smell system, and in your taste system "
2595.68,"just the tiniest bit of training and attention, "
2598.48,"and sniffing, inhaling can radically change "
2602.28,your relationship to food 
2603.7,such that you actually start to feel very different 
2607.09,as a consequence of ingesting those foods 
2608.95,as well as becoming more discerning about which foods 
2612.53,you like and which ones you don't like. 
2614.067,And we're going to talk about that 
2615.33,because there's a really wonderful thing 
2617.32,that happens when you start developing a sensitive palate 
2620.04,and a sensitive sense of smell 
2623.16,in a way that allows you to guide your eating 
2626.54,"and smelling decisions, "
2627.98,and maybe even interpersonal decisions 
2629.62,"about who you spend time with, or mate with, or whatever, "
2632.9,in a way that is really in line with your biology. 
2636.11,"In fact, how well we can smell and taste things "
2639.34,is actually a very strong indication of our brain health. 
2643.52,"Now, that's not to say "
2644.44,that if you have a poor sense of smell 
2646.01,"or a poor sense of taste, that you're somehow brain damaged "
2648.74,"or you're going to have dementia, "
2651.58,although sometimes early signs of dementia 
2654.68,or loss of neurons in other regions of the brain 
2657.2,related to say Parkinson's can show up first 
2660.22,as a loss of sense of smell. 
2662.68,"Again, it's not causal, "
2665.27,and it's certainly not the case that every time 
2667.67,you have a sudden loss of smell 
2668.86,"that there's necessarily brain damage, "
2670.33,"I want to be very about that, "
2672.04,but they are often correlated. 
2675.6,There's also a lot of interest right now 
2677.14,in loss of sense of smell 
2678.53,because one of the early detection signs of COVID-
19,
2681.61,was a loss of sense of smell. 
2683.49,"So, I just briefly want to talk about loss of sense of smell "
2686.68,and regaining sense of smell and taste 
2689.34,because these have powerful implications for overall health. 
2693.23,And in fact can indicate something about brain damage 
2696.82,and can even inform how quickly we might be recovering 
2699.76,from something like a concussion. 
2702.13,"So, our olfactory neurons, "
2704.01,these neurons in our nose that detect odors 
2707.49,are really unique among other brain neurons 
2710.84,"because they get replenished throughout life, "
2714.75,"they don't just regenerate, but they get replenished. "
2718.59,"So regeneration is when something is damaged and it regrows, "
2723.11,these neurons are constantly turning 
2725.15,"over throughout our lifespan, "
2726.33,"they're constantly being replenished, "
2727.89,they're dying off and they're being replaced by new ones. 
2731.38,This is an amazing aspect of our brain 
2734.04,"that's basically unique to these neurons, "
2735.953,there's one other region of the brain 
2737.7,"where there's a little bit of this maybe, "
2739.75,but these olfactory neurons 
2742.41,about every three or four weeks they die. 
2746.32,"And when they die, they're replaced "
2748.09,"by new ones that come from a different region of the brain, "
2751.99,a region called the subventricular zone. 
2753.84,"The name isn't as important, "
2755.62,"but as the phenomenon, "
2757.54,"but these neurons are born in the ventricle, "
2759.92,the area of your brain that's a hole that contains... 
2762.1,"It's not an empty hole, "
2763.11,it's a hole basically that contains cerebral spinal fluid. 
2766.03,"Well, there's a little subventricular zone, "
2768.07,"there's a little zone below, sub ventricles. "
2771.46,"And that zone, if you are exercising regularly, "
2775.45,"if your dopamine levels are high enough, "
2779.89,those little cells there are like stem cells. 
2783.37,They are stem cells and they spit out 
2785.4,"what are called little neuroblasts, "
2787.3,those little neuroblasts migrate 
2789.57,"into the front of your brain and then shimmy, "
2792.96,they kind of move through 
2793.793,what's called the rostral migratory stream. 
2795.86,They kind of shimmy along 
2797.39,"and land back in your olfactory bulb, "
2799.72,settle down and extend little wires 
2801.74,into your olfactory mucosa. 
2803.87,This is an ongoing process of what we call neurogenesis 
2807.15,or the birth of new neurons. 
2809.23,"Now, this is really interesting "
2812.12,"because other neurons in your cortex, in your retina, "
2816.39,"in your cerebellum, they do not do this, "
2818.51,they are not continually replenished throughout life. 
2821.37,"But these neurons, these olfactory neurons are, "
2823.66,they are special. 
2826.04,And there are a number of things 
2827.76,that seem to increase the amount 
2829.85,of olfactory neuron neurogenesis. 
2832.23,"There is evidence that exercise, blood flow, "
2835.8,can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis. 
2838.31,"Although, those data are fewer "
2841.15,"in comparison to things like social interactions, "
2844.29,or actually interacting with odorants of different kinds. 
2848.78,"So, if you're somebody who doesn't smell things well, "
2851.75,"you have a poor sense of smell, "
2853.12,"your olfactory system doesn't seem very sensitive, "
2855.71,"more sniffing, more smelling is going to be good. "
2858.5,"And then the molecule dopamine, this neuromodulator, "
2862.36,that is associated with motivation and drive. 
2865.54,"And in some cases, if it's very, very high with mania, "
2868.88,"or if it's very, very low with depression or Parkinson's, "
2872.11,but for most people where dopamine 
2873.85,is in essentially normal ranges 
2876.87,dopamine is also a powerful trigger of the establishment 
2881.19,of these new neurons and their migration 
2883.03,into the olfactory bulb and your ability to smell. 
2886.89,"Now, you don't want to confuse correlation with causation, "
2889.79,so if you're not good at smelling 
2891.39,does that mean you have low dopamine? 
2892.83,"No, not necessarily. "
2893.96,"If you have low dopamine, "
2895.04,does that mean that you have a poor sense of smell? 
2896.86,"No, not necessarily. "
2898.4,Some people who take antidepressants of the sort 
2901.61,that impact the dopamine system strongly like Wellbutrin 
2905.83,"will report a sudden, meaning within a couple of days, "
2909.24,"increase in their ability to smell particular odors, "
2913.53,and it's a very striking effect. 
2915.72,Some people when they are in a new relationship 
2918.17,"because dopamine and the hormones, "
2920.11,testosterone and estrogen are associated with novelty 
2924.04,and the sorts of behaviors that often are associated 
2926.85,with new relationships those three molecules; 
2929.67,"dopamine, testosterone, and estrogen kind of work together. "
2933.4,And oftentimes people will say 
2936.29,or report when they're newly in love 
2938.1,"or in a new relationship that they're just obsessed with, "
2940.87,or they just so enjoy the scent of another person 
2943.32,so much so that they like to borrow 
2945.98,the other person's clothing 
2947.2,or they'll sniff the other person's clothing 
2949.04,or they can even just in the absence of the person 
2951.92,"they can imagine their smell and feel a biological response, "
2955.65,something that we'll talk more about. 
2957.26,"So, these neurons turnover throughout the lifespan "
2959.84,"and as we age, we actually can lose our sense of smell. "
2963.41,"And it's likely, I want to underscore likely, "
2965.58,that that loss of sense of smell as we age 
2967.26,is correlated with a loss of other neurons 
2969.76,"in the retina, in the ears, a loss of vision, "
2972.25,"loss of hearing, loss of smell, loss of the sense apparati "
2976.45,which our neurons is correlated with aging. 
2980.45,"So, what we've been talking about today "
2982.32,"is the ability to sense these odors, "
2984.45,but what I'd like to do is empower you with tools 
2986.94,that will allow you to keep these systems tuned up. 
2989.01,"Last time, we talked about tuning up "
2990.7,and keeping your visual system tuned up and healthy 
2993.87,regardless of age. 
2994.92,"Here, we're talking about really enhancing "
2997.75,"your olfactory abilities, your taste abilities as well "
3001.99,"by interacting a lot with odors, preferably positive odors, "
3007.13,"and sniffing more, inhaling more, "
3010.27,"which almost sounds crazy, "
3011.42,but now you understand why. 
3013.16,Even though it might sound crazy 
3014.2,it's grounded in real mechanistic biology 
3016.81,of how the brain wakes up and responds to these chemicals. 
3020.26,"Now, speaking of brain injury, "
3021.66,olfactory dysfunction is a common theme 
3024.61,"in traumatic brain injury for the following reason, "
3027.09,these olfactory neurons as I mention 
3029.4,"extend wires into the mucosa of the nose, "
3033.31,but they also extend a wire up into the skull. 
3035.99,And they extend up into the skull 
3037.62,"through what's called the cribriform plate, "
3039.28,it's like a Swiss cheese type plate 
3041.68,where they're going through. 
3042.78,"And if you get a head hit, "
3044.94,"that bone, the cribriform plate, "
3046.91,sheers those little wires off 
3048.597,and those neurons die. 
3050.98,"Now, eventually they'll be replaced, "
3053.1,but there's a phenomenon by which concussion 
3056.34,and the severity of concussion 
3057.77,and the recovery from a head injury 
3059.71,"can actually be gauged in part, "
3061.72,"in part, not in whole, "
3062.74,but in part by how well or fully one recovers 
3066.78,their sense of smell. 
3068.48,"So, if you're somebody that unfortunately "
3069.89,"has suffered a concussion, "
3071.2,your sense of smell is one readout 
3073.82,by which you might evaluate whether or not you're regaining 
3076.41,some of your sensory performance. 
3078.03,"Of course, there will be others "
3078.93,"like balance, and cognition, and sleep, et cetera. "
3081.33,But I'd like to refer you to a really nice paper 
3084.98,which is entitled Olfactory Dysfunction 
3087.14,in Traumatic Brain Injury: the Role of Neurogenesis 
3090.0,"the first author is Marin, M-A-R-I-N. "
3093.135,The paper was published 
3094.54,"in Current Allergy and Asthma Report, this is "
2020.,
3098.07,"I spent some time with this paper, it's quite good, "
3100.15,"it's a review article, "
3101.27,I like reviews if they're peer-reviewed reviews 
3104.77,and in quality journals. 
3106.48,And what they discuss 
3108.14,is and I'll just read here briefly 
3109.56,"'cause they said it better than I could, "
3111.097,"""Olfactory functioning disturbances are common "
3113.08,"following traumatic brain injury, TBI, "
3115.02,and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. 
3117.62,Although there is no standard treatment for patients 
3119.27,"with the loss of smell."" "
3122.59,"Now I'm paraphrasing, ""Post-injury olfactory training "
3127.42,has shown promise for beneficial effects. 
3131.38,"Some of this involves,"" "
3132.88,"they go on to tell us the role of dopamine, "
3135.59,"dopaminergic signaling, as I mentioned before, "
3137.96,but what does this mean? 
3138.93,This means that if you've had a head injury 
3141.94,or repeated head injuries that enhancing your sense of smell 
3145.73,is one way by which you can create new neurons. 
3148.82,"And now, you know how to enhance your sense of smell "
3150.75,"by interacting with things that have an odor very closely, "
3154.06,"and by essentially inhaling more, "
3156.81,focusing on the inhale to wake up the brain 
3159.39,and to really focus on some of the nuance of those smells. 
3162.4,"So, you might do for instance a smell test "
3165.33,"by which you smell something like a lemon, "
3167.18,"put it down, do "
10,"inhales or so, "
3169.33,"smell again, et cetera. "
3170.89,You might also just take a more active role 
3172.87,"in trying to taste and smell your food, "
3176.47,and taste and smell various things. 
3178.54,"I mean, please don't ingest anything "
3179.77,"that's poisonous that you're not supposed to be ingesting, "
3181.91,"but you know what I mean, "
3183.09,"really tuning up this system, "
3184.8,"I think is an excellent review, "
3186.5,we're going to do an entire episode 
3188.13,"all about the use of the visual system in particular, "
3190.6,but also the olfactory system for treatment 
3192.46,"of traumatic brain injury, as well as other methods. "
3195.02,But I wanted to just mention it here 
3197.03,because a number of people asked me about TBI. 
3199.45,"And here again, we're in this place where the senses "
3202.65,and our ability to sense these chemicals 
3203.703,"through these two holes in the front of our face, "
3205.91,our nostrils is a powerful readout 
3209.17,and way to control brain function 
3211.6,and nervous system function generally. 
3213.48,"Just a quick note about the use of smelling salts, "
3216.13,I have a feeling that some of you may be interested in that 
3218.7,and its application. 
3219.63,"If you are interested in that, "
3221.36,I recommend you go to the scientific literature first 
3224.42,rather than straight to some vendor 
3227.18,or to the what do they call it these days? 
3229.85,"Costello bro science, he says, "
3232.21,"bro science, the bro science. "
3234.39,"You can go to this paper, which is excellent "
3236.47,"and is real science, which is Acute Effects of Ammonia "
3238.96,Inhalants on Strength and Power Performance in Trained Men. 
3241.94,"It's a randomized controlled trial, it was published "
3243.537,in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research 
3245.93,in 
"2018,",and it should be very easy to find. 
3249.13,"I will provide a link to the so-called PubMed ID, "
3251.83,"which is a string of numbers, "
3253.94,and we'll put that in the caption 
3254.95,"if you want to go straight to that article, "
3256.41,"does show a significant what they call, "
3259.23,"this is what the words they use literally in quotes, "
3261.267,"""psyching up effect through the use "
3264.54,of these ammonia inhalants 
3266.61,and a significant increase in maximal force 
3270.48,"in force development in a variety of different movements."" "
3274.41,"So, for those of you that are interested "
3275.88,"in ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts, "
3279.31,that might be a good reference. 
3281.23,The other thing I wanted to talk about 
3282.38,with reference to odors is this myth 
3285.01,"which is that we don't actually smell things in our dreams, "
3288.78,that we don't have a sense of smell. 
3291.46,"That's pure fiction, I don't know who came up with that, "
3294.38,it's very clear that we are capable 
3296.96,of smelling things in our sleep. 
3299.49,"However, when we are in REM sleep, "
3302.01,"rapid eye movement sleep, "
3303.22,which is the sleep that predominates 
3304.84,toward the second half of the night 
3308.02,our ability to wake up in response to odors is diminished. 
3312.57,"It's not absent, but it's diminished. "
3314.5,"If smoke comes into the room, we will likely wake up "
3318.04,if the concentration of smoke is high enough 
3319.81,"regardless of the stage of sleep we're in, "
3322.04,but in REM sleep we tend to be less likely 
3325.32,"to smell, to sniff. "
3328.04,And that actually was measured in a number of studies 
3330.64,that sniffing in sleep is possible. 
3333.59,"So, if you put an odor like a lemon "
3335.36,underneath someone's nostrils 
3336.65,"in the early portion of the night, they will smell, "
3340.35,and they will later... 
3341.48,"They will sniff, excuse me, "
3343.03,"whether or not they smell or not, I guess depends on them "
3345.0,"and when they showered last, "
3345.91,but they will definitely sniff 
3347.61,"and they will report later, especially if you wake them up "
3350.94,"soon after that, they had a dream "
3354.03,or a percept of the scent of a lemon for instance. 
3357.94,"Later in the night, it's harder for that relationship "
3360.47,"to be established, "
3361.303,it's likely that because of some of the paralysis 
3363.21,"associated with rapid eye movement sleep, "
3365.47,"which is a healthy paralysis, so-called sleep atonia, "
3368.52,you don't want to act out your dreams in REM sleep 
3371.02,that there is a less active tendency to sniff. 
3374.88,"And actually this has real clinical implications, "
3377.85,the ability to sniff 
3380.22,in response to the introduction of an odor 
3383.28,is actually one way in which clinicians assess 
3386.99,whether or not somebody's brain is so-called brain dead. 
3391.05,"That's not a nice term, but brain dead, "
3392.62,or whether or not they have the capacity 
3395.05,to recover from things like coma 
3397.61,"and other states of deep unconsciousness, "
3400.27,or I guess you'd call it subconsciousness. 
3402.66,"So, what will happen is if someone has an injury "
3405.43,"and they're essentially out cold, "
3408.08,"the production of a sniffing reflex, "
3411.94,or a sniffing response to say a lemon 
3414.76,or some other odor presented below the nostrils 
3417.08,is considered a sign that the brain is capable of waking up. 
3420.89,"Now, that's not always the case, but it's one indication. "
3423.78,"So just like you could use mechano sensation, "
3427.09,"so, a toe pinch for instance, "
3429.48,"you know, or scraping the bottom of somebody's barefoot "
3432.24,"to see if they're conscious, "
3434.02,"or shining light in their eyes, "
3435.85,these are all things that you've seen 
3436.81,"in movies and television, "
3437.82,or maybe if you've seen in real life as well. 
3440.47,"Well, odors and chemical sensing is another way "
3443.14,by which you can assess 
3444.09,whether or not the brain is capable of arousal. 
3447.01,And actually olfactory stimulation 
3449.3,is one of the more prominent ones 
3451.09,that's being used in various clinics. 
3453.45,As a last point about specific odors and compounds 
3457.12,"that can increase arousal and alertness, "
3459.48,and this was simply through sniffing them 
3461.35,not through ingesting them. 
3462.88,"There are data, believe it or not, there are good data "
3466.21,"on peppermint and the smell of peppermint, "
3469.34,"minty type sense, "
3472.08,"whether you like them or not will increase attention, "
3475.75,and they can create the same sort of arousal response 
3479.3,although not as intensely 
3480.9,or as dramatically as ammonia salts can for instance. 
3484.31,"By the way, please don't go sniff real ammonia, "
3486.54,you could actually damage your olfactory epithelium 
3488.69,if you do that too close to the ammonia. 
3490.67,If you're going to use smelling salts 
3491.74,be sure you work with someone 
3493.48,or you know what you're getting and how you're using this. 
3495.97,You can damage your olfactory pathway 
3498.46,"in ways that are pretty severe, "
3499.56,you can also damage your vision. 
3500.98,If you've ever teared up because you inhaled something 
3503.22,"that was really noxious, that is not a good thing, "
3507.15,"it doesn't mean you necessarily cause damage, "
3508.86,but it means that you have irritated the mucosal lining 
3512.82,"and possibly even the surfaces of your eyes, "
3515.53,"so please be very, very careful. "
3518.17,"Scents like peppermint, "
3520.37,"like these ammonia smelling salts, "
3522.37,the reason they wake you up 
3523.55,is because they trigger specific olfactory neurons 
3526.69,"that communicate with the specific centers of the brain, "
3529.06,namely the amygdala and associated neurocircuitry 
3531.46,and pathways that trigger alertness 
3533.44,"of the same sort that a cold shower or an ice bath, "
3537.01,"or a sudden surprise, "
3538.75,or a stressful text message would evoke. 
3541.35,"Remember, the systems of your body that produce arousal, "
3545.309,"and alertness, and attention, "
3547.3,"and that cue you for optimal learning, aka focus. "
3550.55,"Those are very general mechanisms, "
3552.09,they involve very basic molecules like adrenaline 
3554.74,"and epinephrin same thing actually, "
3556.13,adrenaline and epinephrin. 
3558.35,"The number of stimuli, whether it's peppermint or ammonia, "
3562.21,"or a loud blast, "
3565.02,the number of stimuli that can evoke 
3566.99,that adrenaline response and that wake up response 
3570.06,are near infinite. 
3571.62,"And that's the beauty of your nervous system, "
3573.63,it was designed to take any variety of different stimuli 
3577.08,"placed them into categories, "
3578.74,and then evoke different categories 
3580.97,of very general responses. 
3583.12,"Now, you know a lot about olfaction "
3584.65,"and how the sense of smell works, "
3586.05,here's another experiment that you can do. 
3588.82,I'll ask you right now. 
3590.73,"Do you like, hate, or are you indifferent "
3594.89,to the smell of microwave popcorn? 
3598.48,"Some people, including one member of my podcast staff "
3601.8,"says it's absolutely disgusting to them, "
3604.75,they feel like it's completely nauseating. 
3607.83,"I don't mind it at all, "
3608.663,"in fact, I kind of like it. "
3609.91,I think the smell of a microwave popcorn 
3611.62,is kind of pleasant. 
3612.453,"I don't particularly like it, "
3613.55,but it's certainly not unpleasant. 
3617.52,Some people have a gene that makes them sensitive 
3621.77,to the smell of things like microwave popcorn 
3624.39,such that it smells like vomit. 
3627.85,I probably don't have that gene 
3629.94,because I find the smell 
3630.773,of microwaved popcorn pretty pleasant. 
3633.67,"Some people hate the smell of cilantro, "
3637.58,"some people ingest asparagus, "
3640.53,and when they urinate they can smell the asparagus 
3643.28,"in a very pungent way, "
3644.68,other people can't smell it at all. 
3647.06,These are variants in genes that encode 
3650.19,for what are called olfactory receptors. 
3653.89,"Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene, "
3658.63,one gene that codes for a receptor 
3661.27,that responds to a particular odor. 
3663.42,If you don't have that gene 
3664.84,you will not respond to that odor. 
3667.26,"So, the reason why some people find the smell "
3670.33,"of microwave popcorn to be very noxious, putrid in fact, "
3673.87,is because they have a gene that allows them 
3675.98,to smell the kind of putrid odor within that. 
3680.11,"Other people who lack that gene just simply can't smell it, "
3683.53,so we are not all the same 
3685.42,with respect to our sensory experience. 
3687.36,"What one person finds delicious, "
3689.43,another person might find disgusting. 
3691.14,I'll give a good example 
3692.97,which is that I absolutely despise 
3695.55,"Gorgonzola and blue cheese, absolutely despise it, "
3698.59,it smells and tastes 
3701.75,like dirty moldy socks to me. 
3704.84,"Some people love it, they crave it, "
3706.59,"actually, some people get a visceral response to it, "
3708.947,and we will talk about how certain tastes 
3711.74,"can actually evoke very deep biological responses, "
3715.63,even hormonal responses 
3717.17,when we talk about taste in a few minutes. 
3719.62,"But there are these odors, "
3721.49,for instance in popcorn 
3722.82,it's the molecule 
2-acetyl-,
"1-pyrroline,",
3727.84,"not proline but pyrroline, "
3729.78,that gives off to some people like me 
3731.75,"a toasted smell as the sugars in the kernels heat, "
3734.87,but the compound is also found 
3737.32,"in things like white bread and jasmine rice, "
3739.36,"which don't have as pungent an odor, "
3742.01,but some people smell that and it smells like cat urine. 
3746.82,"Now, there are scents like musky scents and musty scents "
3752.02,that are secreted by animals like skunks 
3754.45,and other animals of the so-called Mustelidae family. 
3757.82,"So, these would be ferrets and other animals that can spray "
3761.6,"in response to fear, or if they just want to mark a territory "
3765.44,because they want to say that's mine. 
3767.12,"Dogs incidentally have scent glands that they rub on things, "
3769.7,cats have them too. 
3771.12,"This musty odor, some people find actually quite pleasant, "
3774.98,some people find it to be very noxious 
3777.39,"and that will depend of course on the concentration, right? "
3780.76,I'll never forget the first time 
3782.44,Costello got sprayed by a skunk and it was awful. 
3786.13,"I actually don't mind the smell of skunk at a distance, "
3789.51,"it's actually a little bit pleasant, "
3790.7,I admit it's a little bit pleasant to me. 
3792.84,I don't think that makes me too weird 
3794.02,because if you ever read the book 
3795.227,"""All Quiet on the Western Front"" about World War I, "
3798.25,there's a description in there about the smell of skunk 
3800.93,"at a distance being mildly pleasant, "
3802.87,so the author of that book probably shared 
3805.23,"a similar olfactory profile to me, or I to them rather, "
3810.02,but some people find even the tiniest bit 
3812.41,of the smell of skunk or musk to be noxious or awful. 
3816.41,"Now, of course in high concentrations, it's really awful. "
3818.55,"And unfortunately, poor Costello, "
3819.72,"he was like literally red-eyed and just snorting, "
3823.41,and it was awful. 
3824.48,There's a joke about dogs that says that dogs 
3827.19,either get skunked one time and never again 
3830.21,or 
50,or a hundred times. 
3831.5,"Costello has been skunked no fewer, "
3833.85,"I'm not making this up, "
3834.73,has been skunked no fewer than 
103,times. 
3838.16,And that's because if he sees something 
3840.5,"or hears something in the bushes, he just goes straight in, "
3842.39,he does not learn. 
3843.96,"But if you like this, that musty scent or musky scent, "
3848.69,well that says something about the genes that you express 
3851.15,"in your olfactory neurons, "
3852.5,it is completely inherited. 
3854.93,"And if you don't like that scent, "
3856.36,if it's really noxious 
3857.45,"or you have this response to microwave popcorn, "
3859.19,"well, that means you have a different compliment, "
3861.22,a different constellation if you will 
3863.77,of genes that make up for these olfactory sensory neurons 
3867.75,and the receptors that they express. 
3869.66,Let's talk about taste. 
3871.29,"Not whether or not you have taste or you don't have taste, "
3873.9,"there's no way for me to assess that, "
3876.06,"but rather how we taste things, "
3879.51,meaning how we sense chemicals in food and in drink. 
3884.44,"There are essentially five, "
3886.18,but scientists now believe there may be six things 
3889.584,"that we taste alone or in combination, "
3893.89,"they are sweet tastes, "
3896.46,"salty tastes, bitter tastes, "
3900.42,"sour tastes, and umami taste. "
3904.8,"Most of you probably heard of umami by now, "
3906.91,it's U-M-A-M-I. 
3909.69,Umami is actually the name for a particular receptor 
3914.06,that you express on your tongue 
3915.414,"that detects savory tastes, "
3920.02,so it's the kind of thing in braised meats. 
3922.81,Sometimes people can even get the activation of umami 
3926.92,by tomatoes or tomato sauces. 
3931.1,What are each of these tastes 
3932.77,and taste receptors responsible for? 
3935.03,"And then we'll talk about the sixth, "
3936.43,"maybe you can guess what it is, "
3937.53,I don't know if you can guess it now. 
3938.76,"I couldn't guess it, but of the five tastes "
3942.12,each one has a specific utility or function. 
3946.41,"Each one has a particular group of neurons in your mouth, "
3951.0,"in your tongue, believe it or not, "
3953.31,that responds to particular chemicals 
3955.88,and particular chemical structures. 
3958.38,"It is a total myth, complete fiction, "
3961.45,that different parts of your tongue 
3963.12,harbor different taste receptors. 
3966.062,"You know, that high school textbook diagram "
3967.88,that you know sweet is in one part of the tongue 
3969.81,"and sour is in another, "
3971.4,"and bitters in another, complete fiction, "
3973.57,just total fiction related to very old studies 
3976.15,"that were performed in a very poorly controlled way, "
3978.77,no serious biologists 
3980.96,and certainly no one that works on tastes 
3982.37,would contend that that's the way 
3985.28,"that the taste receptors are organized, "
3987.0,they are completely intermixed along your tongue. 
3989.46,If you have heightened or decreased sensitivity 
3992.61,to one of those five things I mentioned; 
3994.66,"sweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour "
3996.66,"at one location in your tongue, "
3997.86,it likely reflects the density of overall receptors 
4003.17,"or something going on in your brain, "
4005.9,but not the differential distribution of those receptors. 
4010.52,"So, the sweet receptors are neurons that express "
4014.03,"a receptor that respond to sugars, "
4017.56,"in the same way that you have cones, photoreceptors, "
4019.93,"in your eye that respond to short, "
4021.99,"medium, or long wavelength light, "
4023.78,"meaning blueish, greenish, or reddish light. "
4027.56,"You have a neuron, or neurons plural, "
4030.962,in your tongue that respond to sugars. 
4035.92,"And then those neurons, they don't say sweet, "
4038.74,"they don't actually send any sugar into the brain, "
4041.21,"they send what we call a volley, "
4043.22,a barrage of action potentials of electrical signals 
4045.73,off into the brain. 
4046.9,It's an amazing system. 
4048.55,"So, all these receptors in your tongue "
4050.4,make up what are called the neurons 
4053.36,"that give rise to a nerve, "
4054.78,"a collection of wires, nerve bundles "
4057.51,"of what's called the gustatory nerve, "
4059.84,it goes from the tongue 
4061.66,to the so-called nucleus of the solitary tract. 
4064.427,"And some of you requested names, "
4066.3,I usually don't like to include too many names 
4068.21,"for sake of clarity, "
4069.13,but the gustatory nerve from the tongue 
4071.28,goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract 
4073.45,and then to the thalamus and to insular cortex. 
4076.65,You don't have to remember any of those names 
4078.54,"if you don't want to, "
4079.43,"but if you want mechanism, you want neural circuits, "
4081.28,"that's the circuit, gustatory nerve from the tongue, "
4084.75,"nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem, "
4086.6,"then the thalamus, and then insular cortex. "
4089.13,"And it is in insular cortex, "
4090.62,this regenerate cortex that we sort out 
4092.73,and make sense of and perceive the various tastes. 
4096.05,"Now, it's amazing because just taking a little bit "
4099.64,of sugar or something sour 
4101.43,like a little bit of lemon juice 
4102.55,and touching it to the tongue 
4104.23,within 
100,"milliseconds, right? "
4107.38,Just 
100,"milliseconds, far less than one second, "
4110.81,you can immediately distinguish 
4112.71,"ah, that's sour, "
4113.73,"that sweet, that's bitter, that's umami, "
4117.18,and that's an assessment that's made by the cortex. 
4121.66,"Now, what to these different five receptors encode for? "
4126.17,"Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, "
4127.95,but what are they really looking for? 
4129.87,What are they sensing? 
4131.51,"Well, sweet stuff signals the presence of energy, of sugars. "
4135.86,And while we're all trying 
4137.08,or we're told that we should eat less sugar 
4140.24,"for a variety of reasons, "
4143.07,the ability to sense whether or not a food 
4145.1,has rapid energy source 
4147.91,or could give rise to glucose is essential 
4149.92,so we have sweet receptors. 
4151.49,"The salty receptors, these neurons are trying to sense "
4155.54,whether or not there are electrolytes 
4158.12,in a given food or drink. 
4160.81,Electrolytes are vitally important 
4162.35,"for the function of our nervous system, "
4163.66,"and for our entire body, "
4164.79,sodium is what allows neurons to fire. 
4168.18,What allows them to be electrically active. 
4170.6,"We also need potassium and magnesium, "
4172.31,those are the ions that allow the neurons to be active. 
4175.47,"So the salty receptors, "
4176.78,the reason that they are there 
4178.64,"is to make sure that we are getting enough, "
4180.55,"but not too much salt, "
4182.22,we don't want to ingest things that are far too salty. 
4186.82,Bitter receptors are there 
4189.22,to make sure we don't ingest things that are poisonous. 
4192.34,How do I know this? 
4193.21,How can I say that? 
4194.08,Even though I was definitely not consulted 
4196.04,"at the design phase, how can I say that? "
4197.63,"Well, the bitter receptors "
4199.88,"create a what we call labeled line, "
4201.81,a unique trajectory to the neurons 
4204.9,"of the brainstem that control the [gags], "
4207.2,the gag reflex. 
4209.35,If we taste something very bitter 
4211.5,it automatically triggers the gag reflex. 
4214.56,"Now, some people like bitter taste, "
4215.83,"I actually liked the taste of bitter coffee, "
4217.81,children generally like sweet tastes 
4219.46,"more than bitter tastes, "
4220.79,"but even babies if they taste something bitter, "
4222.68,"they'll just immediately spit it up, "
4224.083,it's like the gag reflex. 
4226.06,"Putrid smells will also evoke the same neurons, "
4229.9,"so some people are very sensitive, "
4231.69,they have a very sensitive 
4233.62,"or low threshold vomit reflex, "
4236.39,you're going to and there was somebody in my lab early on. 
4239.782,"And we never did this intentionally, and we're just laughing "
4241.24,'cause it was so dramatic. 
4243.24,"How we would have a discussion, "
4244.33,"someone would say something about something kind of gross, "
4248.16,"appropriate for the workplace, but nonetheless gross, "
4250.11,"we are biologists, "
4251.42,"would say something and they would say, ""Stop, stop stop, "
4253.61,"I'm going to throw up."" "
4254.71,You know and some people have a very low threshold 
4257.66,quick gag reflex. 
4259.78,"Other people don't, other people have a very stable stomach, "
4262.96,"they don't, you know, "
4263.793,"they rarely, if ever vomit. "
4266.42,The umami receptor isn't sensing savory 
4270.06,"because the body loves savory, "
4272.49,it's because savory is a signal 
4274.67,for the presence of amino acids. 
4276.83,"And we'll talk more about this, "
4278.24,but the presence of amino acids 
4281.03,"in our gut and in our digestive system, "
4283.79,"and the presence of fatty acids is essential, "
4287.28,"there is in fact, no essential carbohydrate or sugar. "
4291.01,"Now, I'm not a huge proponent of ketogenic diets "
4293.61,"nor am I against them, I think it's highly individual, "
4296.78,"you have to decide what's right for you, "
4298.83,"but everybody needs amino acids to survive, "
4302.1,"the brain needs them and we need fatty acids, "
4304.68,"especially to build a healthy brain during development, "
4306.93,you need amino acids and fatty acids. 
4309.92,"And the sour receptor, why would we have a sour receptor? "
4313.33,"So, that we could have those really like sour candies? "
4316.13,I think they've gotten more and more sour over the years. 
4317.96,"I admit I don't eat candy much, "
4320.03,but I do have a particular weakness 
4322.6,for like a really good really sour like gummy peach 
4327.96,or they if the gummy cherries are dipped 
4329.83,"in whatever that sour powder, "
4331.21,"so I was a kid who I admit it, "
4333.03,"I liked the LIK-M-AID thing, "
4334.36,I'd like drink the powder. 
4335.65,"Please don't do this, don't give this garbage to your kids, "
4339.838,"but I liked it, it was tasty, "
4341.72,but sour receptors are not there 
4345.06,so that you can ingest gummy sour gummy peaches 
4348.01,"or something like that, that's not why the system evolved, "
4351.05,it's there and we know it's there 
4354.01,to detect the presence of spoiled or fermented food. 
4358.05,"Fermented fruit has a sour element to it, "
4360.84,and fermented things while certainly some fermented foods 
4364.18,"like sauerkraut, and kimchi, and things of that sort "
4366.21,can be very healthy for us 
4367.37,"and are very healthy in reducing inflammation, "
4369.35,"there's great data on that, "
4371.99,"pro quality microbiome, et cetera. "
4377.72,"Fermented fruit can be poisonous, right? "
4379.73,Alcohols are poisonous in many forms to our system 
4383.93,and the sour receptor bearing neurons 
4388.24,communicate to an area of the brainstem 
4390.58,"that evokes the pucker response, "
4393.35,"closing of the eyes and essentially shutting of the mouth, "
4396.6,and cringing away. 
4398.08,"I think cringe is like a thing now, "
4399.3,"my niece, whenever I seem to say something or do something "
4402.13,"it's either an eye-roll, a cringe, or both in combination. "
4406.5,"So the sour, the sweet, "
4409.86,"the salty, the bitter, and the umami system, "
4412.4,were not there so that we could have this wonderful pallet 
4415.36,"of foods that we enjoy so much, "
4418.35,"they'll allow us to do that, but they're there to make sure "
4420.66,that we bring in certain things 
4421.87,to our system and that we don't ingest other things. 
4424.91,"Now, what's the sixth sense "
4427.71,within the taste system? 
4428.94,"Not sixth sense generally, but within the taste system. "
4430.81,What's this putative possible sixth receptor? 
4434.48,I already kind of hinted at it 
4436.23,"when I talked about fatty acids, "
4438.2,there are now data to support the idea 
4441.87,although there's still more work that needs to be done 
4443.94,that we also have receptors on our tongue that sense fat. 
4448.09,And that because fat is so vital for the function 
4452.28,of our nervous system and the other organs of our body 
4455.21,"that we are sensing the fat content in food, "
4457.96,"maybe this is why I can only eat half, "
4461.27,but no less than half of a jar of almond butter 
4463.61,or peanut butter in one sitting. 
4465.26,"I just can't, unless it's not salted, "
4466.77,"in which case, it makes no sense to me. "
4468.8,"But it's remarkable how that texture, "
4473.4,"and also the flavor, but that texture of fat. "
4476.51,"I love butter, I am guilty, "
4478.28,and Costello is definitely guilty of eating pats of butter 
4481.15,"from time to time, I have no guilt about this. "
4483.01,"People eat pats of cheese, "
4484.16,why shouldn't we eat a pat of butter? 
4486.25,If you think that's gross 
4487.34,then maybe I have a greater abundance 
4490.14,"of the fat receptors in my tongue, "
4492.34,maybe I have a fat tongue than you do. 
4495.37,"But nonetheless, the ability to sense fat here in our mouth "
4499.63,"seems to be critical, "
4501.36,you can imagine why that is. 
4504.21,I want to talk about the tongue 
4506.16,and the mouth as an extension of your digestive tract. 
4509.94,"I know that might not be pleasant to think about, "
4512.07,but when you look at it 
4513.14,"through the lens that I'm about to provide, "
4515.07,it will completely change the way you think 
4516.65,about the gut brain 
4517.8,and about all the stuff that you've heard 
4519.01,"in these recent years about oh, we have this second brain, "
4522.53,"it's all these neurons in our gut, "
4523.7,I've been chuckling through these last few years 
4527.01,"as people have gotten so excited about the gut brain, "
4529.42,"not because of their excitement, "
4530.82,"I think that excitement is wonderful, "
4532.28,but we always knew that the nervous system 
4534.13,"extended out of the brain and into the body, "
4538.44,and people seem kind of overwhelmed 
4540.61,and surprised by the idea that we have neurons in our gut 
4543.7,that can sense things like sugars and fatty acids. 
4546.56,"And I think those are beautiful discoveries, "
4548.27,don't get me wrong. 
4549.103,Diego Bohorquez's lab out of Duke University 
4551.57,has done beautiful studies showing that 
4553.81,within the mucosal lining of our gut 
4556.39,"we have neurons that sense fatty acids, "
4558.53,"sugars, and amino acids, "
4560.9,and that when we ingest something 
4562.93,"that contains one or two or three of those things, "
4565.51,there's a signal sent via the vagus nerve 
4567.97,"up into what's called the nodose ganglion, "
4570.9,"N-O-D-O-S-E, "
4573.11,and then into the brain where it secretes dopamine 
4575.57,"which makes us want more of that thing, "
4577.36,it makes us more motivated to pursue 
4579.9,"and eat more of that thing, "
4581.66,"that's either fatty, or umami, savory, "
4585.29,"or has a sweet taste, "
4587.95,"any one or two or three of those qualities, "
4591.7,independent of the taste. 
4593.55,"Now, I think those are beautiful data, "
4595.28,"but we know that this thing, the mouth. "
4598.057,And for those of you listening 
4599.11,"I've just got my couple of fingers in my mouth, "
4600.67,that's why I sound like I've got something in my mouth. 
4604.8,"This thing in the front of our face, "
4606.67,"we use it for speaking, "
4607.61,but it is the front of our digestive tract. 
4609.58,We are essentially a series of tubes 
4611.81,and that tube starts with your mouth 
4614.5,and heads down into your stomach. 
4616.42,"And so, that you would sense "
4619.13,so much of the chemical constituents 
4621.03,of the stuff that you might bring into your body 
4623.75,or that you might want to expel and not swallow 
4626.15,or not interact with by being able to smell is it putrid? 
4629.91,Does it smell good? 
4631.4,Does it taste good? 
4632.36,Is this safe? 
4633.193,Is it salty? 
4634.026,Is it so sour that it's fermented and it's going to poison me? 
4637.24,Is it so bitter that it could poison me? 
4639.73,"Is it so savory that, mmm, "
4642.12,yes. I want more and more of this. 
4643.91,"Well, then you'd want to trigger dopamine, "
4645.25,that's all starting in the mouth. 
4647.33,"So, you have to understand that you were equipped "
4651.12,"with this amazing chemical sensing apparatus, "
4654.68,we call your mouth and your tongue. 
4656.74,And those little bumps on your tongue 
4658.42,"that they call the papillae, "
4659.96,those are not your taste buds. 
4661.57,Surrounding those little papillae 
4664.38,like little rivers are these little dents and indentations. 
4668.22,And what dents and indentations do in a tissue 
4670.92,"is they allow more surface area, "
4672.52,they allow you to pack more receptors. 
4674.72,"So, down in those grooves are where all these little neurons "
4677.65,and their little processes are 
4680.65,with these little receptors 
4681.71,"for sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour, "
4683.67,and maybe fat as well. 
4685.007,"And so, it's this incredible device "
4686.75,"that you've been equipped with, "
4688.05,that you can use to interact 
4689.55,with various components of the outside world 
4692.0,and decide whether or not you want to bring them in or not. 
4695.35,"Just as you can lose those olfactory neurons, "
4697.67,if you happen to get hit on the head 
4699.66,"or you have some other thing, "
4702.08,maybe it was an infection that caused loss 
4704.04,"of those olfactory sensory neurons, "
4706.01,you can also lose taste receptors in your mouth. 
4709.68,"If you've ever eaten something that's too hot, "
4713.87,"not spicy hot, but too hot, "
4716.34,"you burn your tongue, you burn receptors. "
4720.04,It takes about a week to recover those receptors. 
4723.55,"For some people it's a little bit more quickly, "
4725.87,but if you burn your tongue badly 
4727.84,by ingesting a soup that's too hot 
4729.38,"or a beverage that's too hot, "
4730.46,you will greatly reduce your sense of taste 
4733.12,for essentially all tastes. 
4736.72,And that's because those neurons sit very shallow 
4741.32,"beneath the tongue's surface, "
4742.95,"and so that if you put something too hot on, "
4744.28,you literally just burn those neurons away. 
4746.06,Luckily those neurons also can replenish themselves. 
4749.41,"Those neurons are of the peripheral nervous system, "
4752.79,and like all peripheral system neurons 
4754.78,they can replenish or regenerate. 
4757.55,"So, if you burn your mouth in about a week or so "
4760.14,hopefully sooner you'll be able to taste again. 
4763.06,"In fact, everybody's ability to taste "
4767.0,is highly subject to training. 
4769.1,You can really enhance your ability to taste 
4771.45,and taste the different component parts of different foods 
4775.2,"simply by paying attention to what you're trying to taste, "
4778.92,this is an amazing aspect of the taste system. 
4782.37,"I think more than any other system, "
4784.16,the taste system and perhaps the smell system as well 
4787.2,"can be trained so that you can learn to pick out the tones, "
4792.33,"if you will of different ice cream, "
4795.97,or different beverages. 
4798.56,"I'm somebody who, you know, "
4799.67,"I don't drink much alcohol, "
4800.8,"I'll occasionally have a drink or something, "
4802.46,but a while ago I got to taste a bunch of different 
4807.44,"white tequilas, these are different kinds of tequilas "
4809.86,"that are, they're not brown, they're white. "
4811.72,"And I sort of assumed that all tequila was disgusting, "
4815.97,that was my assumption before doing this. 
4816.84,And then I tasted a couple of white tequilas 
4818.76,"and I realized oh, those aren't aren't too bad. "
4820.53,"I tasted a few more, "
4822.12,and then pretty soon I could really start to detect 
4824.52,the nuance and the difference. 
4825.84,"Now, I haven't had a tequilas in a long time, "
4828.06,"now I sort of tend to not drink at all these days, "
4830.53,but in a very short period of time like a couple of days 
4833.3,I got very good at detecting which things I liked 
4835.84,and I could start to pick out tones. 
4837.69,"So, I'm not a wine drinker, "
4839.19,"but for those of you that are, "
4840.7,"you know, you hear about oh, it has floral tones, "
4842.82,"or berry tones, or chocolate tones. "
4844.85,"You know, some of that is just kind of menu-based "
4848.71,and kind of marketing-based silliness 
4851.29,designed to get you excited 
4852.97,about what you're about to ingest. 
4854.24,"But some of it is real, "
4855.72,and for people that are skilled 
4857.41,in assessing wines or assessing foods. 
4861.13,"I'm much more of an eater than a drinker, "
4863.15,"you can really start to develop a sensitive palate, "
4866.04,a nuanced palette through what we call top-down mechanisms. 
4869.62,"This olfactory cortex that takes these five, "
4873.03,"maybe the sixth fat receptor too, "
4874.9,information and tries to make sense 
4877.51,of what's out there in the world. 
4879.0,"And what its utility is, is it good? Is it bad? "
4882.41,Do I want more of it or less than it? 
4884.2,That neural circuitry is unlike other neural circuitry 
4887.78,in that it seems very amenable 
4889.72,"to behavioral plasticity for whatever reason, "
4893.29,and we could talk about what those reasons might be. 
4895.61,"You know, it's interesting sometimes "
4896.87,"to think about how your taste literally, chemical taste, "
4901.23,"is probably very different than that of other people, "
4903.88,how a food tastes to you is probably very different 
4906.71,than how it tastes to somebody else. 
4907.93,The same probably cannot be said of something 
4910.24,"like vision or hearing, unless you're somebody "
4912.7,"who has perfect pitch or your color vision is disrupted, "
4916.75,"or you're a mantis shrimp, "
4917.97,chances are when we look at the same object 
4920.16,two people are seeing more or less the same object 
4923.06,or perceiving it in a very similar way. 
4925.4,There are experiments that essentially establish that. 
4928.08,"Now we, have taste receptors "
4930.18,"and a lot of those tastes receptors, "
4931.06,"their chemical structures are known, "
4933.16,they come with fancy names like the T
1R,
1,or the T
1R,
"2,",
4937.94,which were identified as the sweet and umami receptors. 
4941.98,"So, what's interesting is that this umami flavor "
4945.14,is the savory flavor rather 
4946.883,that's sensed by umami receptors is very close 
4950.4,to the receptor that detects sweet things. 
4954.5,"Similarly, bitter is sensed "
4957.39,by a whole other set of receptors. 
4959.63,"Now, there's a fun naturally occurring experiment "
4962.8,"that will forever change the way that you look at animals, "
4967.03,and the way certainly that I think about dogs 
4969.21,and Costello in particular. 
4971.47,Carnivorous large animals like tigers 
4975.39,"and some grizzly bears for instance, "
4978.08,"we know that they have no ability to detect sweet, "
4982.07,they don't actually have the receptors 
4984.34,"for sweet on their tongue, "
4986.79,but their concentration of umami receptors 
4989.43,of their ability to detect savory 
4992.1,is at least 
"5,",
000,times that which it is in humans. 
4996.88,"In other words, if I eat a little piece of steak, "
5000.52,"or Costello eats a little piece of steak, "
5003.77,"that steak probably tastes much, "
5006.4,much more savory than it does to me. 
5011.03,"So dogs, and tigers, and bears, et cetera, "
5015.05,they're going to taste savory things and smell savory things 
5018.51,"with a much higher degree of sensitivity, "
5021.03,but they can't taste sweet things. 
5022.64,"Other large animals, which are mostly herbivores "
5025.33,like the panda bear for instance. 
5028.25,"It's hard to believe that thing is even a bear, "
5030.11,"I got nothing against pandas, "
5031.52,I just think that they get a little bit too much 
5033.67,of the limelight frankly. 
5035.99,"So, no vendetta against Panda, save the pandas, "
5038.23,"I hope they replenish all the pandas, "
5039.48,but pandas in all their whatever 
5044.02,"have no umami receptors, they can't taste savory, "
5047.62,but they have greatly heightened density of sweet receptors. 
5051.74,"So, there they are eating these whatever bamboos all day "
5054.76,"or not bamboozle, but bamboos all day "
5058.39,and they can taste things that are very sweet 
5062.0,with a much higher degree of intensity. 
5064.66,"And in general, animals that are more gentle "
5069.99,"that are herbivores, excuse me. "
5072.3,"Or animals that have the propensity for aggression, "
5075.01,that's where you really see the divergence 
5076.73,of the umami receptor 
5078.06,because it's associated with meat and amino acids. 
5080.7,And where you see the enhancement of the sweet receptors 
5084.41,"for animals that eat a lot of plants and fruits, "
5087.11,and they probably taste very different to them 
5089.34,than they do to you and me. 
5091.04,"And, so it's interesting to note "
5093.07,"that animals that eat meat, that eat other organisms "
5097.2,can actually extract more savory experience from that. 
5100.25,What does this mean for you? 
5101.5,"All right, do you associate yourself as a tiger, "
5104.32,"or a grizzly bear, or a panda, or a combination of both? "
5106.87,Most people are omnivores. 
5108.44,"However, you may find it interesting that people "
5112.06,that for instance eat a pure carnivore type diet 
5115.99,"or a keto diet where they are ingesting a lot of meat, "
5119.33,so therefore are sensing a lot of umami flavors. 
5122.63,"And I realized not everyone who's keto eats meat, "
5125.42,but those who do that will develop a more sensitive palate 
5129.28,"and likely there are some data, although early data, "
5132.49,craving for umami-like foods. 
5135.32,Whereas people that eat a more plant-based diet 
5138.96,are likely developing a heightened sensitivity 
5143.5,"and desire for, and maybe even dopamine response to sugars "
5147.49,and plant-based foods. 
5149.1,"Now, this is my partial attempt to reconcile "
5152.21,the kind of online battle that seems to exist 
5155.49,"between plant-based versus animal-based, "
5159.27,purely plant-based or purely animal-based diets. 
5162.11,"I think most people are omnivores, "
5163.89,but it's kind of interesting to think 
5165.183,that the systems are plastic 
5168.27,such that people might want more meat 
5170.45,"if they eat more meat, "
5171.38,people might want more plants 
5172.82,if they eat enough plants for a long period of time. 
5175.55,And this might explain some of the chasm that exists 
5178.33,between these two groups. 
5179.8,"Now, this is not to say anything about the ethical "
5183.05,"or the environmental impacts of different things, "
5184.75,I don't even want to get into that 
5185.87,because the meat people say that the plant-based diets 
5188.1,have as much a negative impact 
5189.71,"as the plant people say that the meat based diets, "
5191.64,that's a totally different discussion. 
5193.13,What I'm talking about here is food craving and food seeking 
5196.75,"and one's ability to detect these umami, savory flavors "
5200.49,is going to be enhanced by ingesting more meat 
5202.77,and less activation of the sweet receptors. 
5205.51,"So in other words, the more meat you eat "
5207.41,"the more you're going to become like a tiger, so to speak. "
5210.88,And the more that you avoid these umami flavors and meats 
5215.01,and the more that you would eat plant-based foods 
5217.37,"and in particular sweet foods, "
5218.86,the more you will likely suppress that umami system 
5222.55,"and that you will have a heightened desire for, "
5226.53,appetite for and sensing of sweet foods 
5229.94,or foods that contain sugars. 
5231.98,"What I'm about to tell you is going to seem crazy, "
5235.14,but is extremely interesting 
5237.57,with respect to taste and taste receptors. 
5241.11,"Remember, even though we can enjoy food "
5244.1,and we can evolve our sense 
5245.42,"of what's tasty or not tasty, depending on life decisions, "
5249.13,"environmental changes, et cetera, "
5251.04,the taste system just like the olfactory system 
5252.747,and the visual system 
5254.19,was laid down for the purpose 
5256.66,of moving towards things that are good for us 
5259.42,"and moving away from things that are bad for us, "
5261.41,that's the kind of core function of the nervous system. 
5265.56,"Well, taste receptors are not just expressed on the tongue, "
5270.87,they are expressed in other cells and other tissues as well. 
5274.2,Some of you may be able to imagine foods 
5277.1,that are so delicious to you 
5278.47,that they make your entire body feel good. 
5281.61,Or foods that are so horrifically awful to think about 
5286.44,"let alone taste, that they create a whole body shuddering "
5290.34,or kind of repellent-type response 
5292.73,where you just either cringe or turn your face away 
5295.81,even in the absence of that food. 
5297.68,"That's sort of how I feel about pungent, Gorgonzola cheese. "
5301.75,"If you like Gorgonzola cheese, I don't judge you, "
5305.49,"I just, that's an individual difference. "
5307.61,"I happen to love certain foods, "
5309.62,I do like savory foods very much. 
5312.89,"I, when I think about them, "
5314.53,they just they make me feel good. 
5317.02,And I'm oftentimes not even associating 
5319.97,"with the taste of those foods, "
5321.29,it feels almost like a visceral thing. 
5323.56,"Well, it turns out that some of the taste receptors "
5325.75,"extend beyond the tongue, "
5327.45,that they actually can extend 
5329.14,into portions of the gut and digestive system. 
5332.11,"And if that's not strange enough, "
5335.49,turns out that some of the taste receptors 
5337.32,are actually expressed on the ovaries and the testes. 
5342.77,"So, what that means is that the gonads, "
5344.75,"the very cells, and tissues, and organs in our body "
5348.15,that make up the reproductive axis 
5351.01,are expressing taste receptors. 
5353.08,"Okay, so how do we interpret this? "
5354.25,Does this mean that when you eat something 
5355.91,"that's very savory or very sweet for instance, "
5359.21,that it's triggering activation 
5361.35,of the ovaries or of the testes? 
5364.45,"Well, it's possible. "
5367.02,"Now, how those molecules, "
5369.26,those chemical molecules would actually get there 
5371.36,"isn't clear, the digestive track does not run directly "
5374.78,to the testes or to the ovaries. 
5376.86,"But nonetheless, what this means is that chemical sensing "
5380.06,of the very things that we detect on our tongue 
5381.937,and that we call taste in quotes in food 
5386.7,is also evoking 
5389.52,cellular responses within the reproductive gonads. 
5394.48,"Now, whether or not this underlies the positive association "
5397.57,"that we have with certain foods isn't clear, "
5400.33,"but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the obvious, "
5404.63,which is that the relationship between the sensual nature 
5410.01,of particular foods 
5411.96,and sensuality generally and the reproductive axis 
5416.2,"is something that's been covered in many movies, "
5419.15,there are entire movies that are focused 
5421.29,"on the relationship between for instance, "
5423.72,"chocolate and love and reproductive behaviors, "
5426.97,or certain feasts of meat 
5430.96,and their wonderful tastes 
5433.36,and the kind of sensuality around feasts 
5436.67,"of different types of foods, "
5438.52,"but in general, it's the sweet and the savory, "
5441.79,"rarely is it the sour or the bitter, the salty or the fat. "
5446.23,"And not surprisingly perhaps, "
5449.29,it is the T
2Rs,and the T
"1Rs,",
5451.603,the receptors that are associated with the sweet 
5454.58,"and with the umami, the savory flavors "
5457.61,that are expressed not just on the tongue 
5459.74,"and in portions of the digestive tract, "
5462.09,but on the gonads themselves. 
5464.31,"So, what does this mean? "
5465.38,Does this mean that eating certain foods 
5466.99,can stimulate the gonads? 
5468.76,"Maybe, there's no data that immediately "
5470.66,"support that right now, but this is an emerging area. "
5474.69,If you'd like to read more about this 
5477.12,"there's a great review, "
5478.76,"entitled Taste perception: From the tongue to the testis, "
5481.99,although they do also talk about the ovaries. 
5484.77,Why they didn't include that in the title 
5486.21,is I think a reflection of the bias of the author. 
5489.73,"The author indeed not incidentally is Feng Li, "
5494.045,last name L-I. 
5496.361,It's a very interesting paper published 
5498.55,in Molecular Human Reproduction. 
5502.2,"You can find it easily online, it's downloadable, "
5504.19,I'll also provide a link to it. 
5506.0,I just think it's fascinating 
5507.65,that these taste receptors are expressed in other tissues. 
5510.07,And I should mention that they're expressed 
5511.35,"in tissues of other areas of the body as well, "
5514.53,"including the respiratory system, "
5516.82,but the richest aggregation 
5520.42,or concentration of these receptors 
5521.87,"for umami and sweet of course is on the tongue, "
5524.13,but also on the gonads. 
5525.78,And I think it does speak 
5527.18,to the possible bridge between 
5529.69,what we think of as a sensory 
5532.19,or a sensual experience of food 
5534.51,"and the deeper kind of visceral sense within the gut, "
5538.09,and maybe even within the gonads as well 
5540.09,"of something that we find extremely pleasurable, "
5542.64,or even appetitive that we want to move toward it. 
5546.32,We are actually going to return to that general theme 
5548.85,in the discussion about touch sensation. 
5552.24,"Some people for instance, "
5554.58,"when they touch certain surfaces like furs, "
5558.09,"or sheep skins, or velvet, "
5561.41,"or soft, smooth surfaces "
5563.63,"it feels good elsewhere in their body, "
5566.27,not just at the point of contact with that surface. 
5570.77,"And similarly, if there's the... "
5574.18,How about this one? 
5575.013,"The screech of chalk on a chalkboard, it's a sound, "
5578.12,"but it has a very strong visceral component, "
5580.77,"or sandpaper, like fingernails on a chalkboard, "
5584.48,"not the sound, but the feeling, right? "
5586.66,"Exactly, so our whole nervous system is tuned "
5589.52,"to either be drawn toward appetitive, "
5592.38,"or repelled by aversive behaviors, right? "
5595.86,"So there's this push-pull that exists, "
5597.81,and what I'm referring to in terms of these receptors 
5599.97,on the tongue that are also expressed on the gonads 
5602.14,is yet another example of what at least in this case 
5604.39,"seems to be an appetitive thing, "
5606.78,a desire to move toward certain foods 
5609.54,and maybe even the experiences 
5610.86,that are associated with those foods. 
5612.43,I want to talk about a particular aspect 
5614.33,of food and a chemical reaction in cooking 
5617.72,called the Maillard reaction. 
5619.34,"Some of you have probably heard of the Maillard reaction, "
5621.58,it's spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D. 
5625.58,"The D is silent, so don't call it the Maillard reaction, "
5628.77,"and it's not the Maillard reaction, "
5631.07,it is the Maillard reaction. 
5632.73,And the Maillard reaction is a reaction 
5635.02,that for the aficionados is a non-enzymatic browning. 
5638.57,"The other form of non-enzymatic browning is caramelization, "
5641.76,"although when you hear caramel, carmel, "
5644.79,I think it's caramel. 
5646.0,"You think sweet, and indeed caramelization is a sugar-sugar "
5651.16,chemical interaction that leads to a kind of nicely toasted 
5655.66,"not burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste. "
5658.68,Whereas the Maillard reaction is that really savory reaction 
5662.53,that occurs when you have a sugar amino acid reaction. 
5665.41,"Remember, we have neurons in our gut, "
5667.01,but also neurons in our tongue 
5669.37,and neurons deep in the brain that are comparing the amount 
5672.61,of sugar to savory. 
5675.84,"Okay, and the Maillard reaction is very interesting "
5678.55,"for you chemists out there, "
5680.0,this is going to be way too elementary. 
5681.47,And for you non-chemists 
5682.4,"it's probably going to be a little bit of a reach, "
5683.99,"but just bear with me, all these chemicals that we sense "
5687.32,"have a different structure, "
5688.44,"it's like hydrogens, and oxygens, "
5689.99,"and aldehyde groups, and all these things. "
5691.38,And basically the Maillard reaction 
5693.04,involves what's called a free aldehyde. 
5695.07,"If you didn't like chemistry, don't worry about it, "
5697.59,it's basically got a group there that kind of sits open 
5701.09,that allows it to interact 
5702.53,with other things and actually through the use of heat 
5705.76,"and the process that we call brazing, "
5708.67,which I'll talk about in a moment 
5710.22,you create a what's called a ketone group. 
5713.12,"Now, most people now have heard of ketones "
5714.74,"'cause they think about the ketogenic diet, "
5716.68,but a ketone group is actually a chemical compound 
5720.65,"that can be used for energy, "
5721.98,"and that's why people say you can use ketones for energy, "
5724.46,"but if you've ever actually encountered ketones, "
5728.14,"if you for instance, get liquid ketones, "
5730.701,"a ketone ester, and you smell it, "
5732.88,what does it smell like? 
5734.13,"It smells a little bit like an alcohol, "
5736.55,"but it has a kind of savory taste, "
5739.95,even when you smell it. 
5741.48,"Okay, there are other smells that have these tastes too, "
5744.19,but for the Maillard reaction 
5746.24,which could be created for instance 
5747.93,"like if you took a piece of meat, "
5749.27,or if you're not a meat eater 
5750.44,if you took tomatoes and you cook them in a pan 
5753.05,and you cooked it nice and slow till it's simmered 
5754.97,and almost started to brown and burn a little bit. 
5757.23,"Usually if I do it burns, I'm not a good cook "
5760.14,"as Costello points out a lot, "
5762.05,"but it gets that like almost tangy, very umami-like flavor. "
5767.81,"And sometimes it will even stick to the pan, "
5770.02,if you scrape it off 
5771.227,and actually you can taste it in your mouth 
5773.43,as you're cooking it. 
5774.64,"That's the Maillard reaction, "
5775.9,"that's that free aldehyde group, "
5777.28,and that's the production of a ketone group. 
5781.03,"When you smell ketones, it smells very much like that. "
5785.32,"Okay, some people talk about the ketones "
5787.26,will produce like fruity breath. 
5788.8,"And that's true if people are really far into ketosis, "
5791.12,"their breath has a kind of fruity odor, "
5792.61,that's a little bit of a different thing. 
5794.33,"So, the relationship between smell and taste "
5796.94,"is a very, very close one. "
5799.43,And this is why when people drink wine 
5800.96,"they often will inhale and then sip, "
5803.49,some of that is just kind of like pomp 
5805.12,"and circumstance frankly, they make a big deal of it, "
5808.35,but they can sense things with their mouth. 
5812.23,The combination of odor receptors 
5815.14,"being activated in a particular way, "
5817.24,and taste receptors in the mouth being activated 
5819.44,"in a particular way, triggers the activation "
5821.72,"of multiple brain areas that are associated with taste, "
5824.58,and circuitry within the body 
5826.82,that's associated with the behaviors 
5829.15,"that relate to that taste like leaning toward it, "
5831.98,or leaning away from it 
5833.11,depending on whether or not it's appetitive or aversive. 
5835.97,So the Maillard reaction is a very interesting reaction 
5838.87,"involving this sugar amino acid thing, "
5841.9,but really it's what it's doing is heating up food 
5845.15,such that the amino acids are more available 
5849.9,literally in their chemical form 
5851.37,for detection by the neurons. 
5853.4,This is a phenomenon that occurs 
5854.69,in other domains of the taste system. 
5857.87,"For instance, a lot of what's happened "
5860.43,with highly processed foods 
5862.91,is that manufacturers have figured out 
5865.7,how to trigger more dopamine response 
5868.37,"by ingestion of these sugary foods and created textures, "
5872.39,and created essentially design of foods for two purposes. 
5875.76,"I'm not out to completely demonize processed food, "
5878.95,"I did that in a previous episode, "
5880.75,but processed foods are really designed to take foods 
5884.54,"that ordinarily would spoil, that would have a shelf life "
5886.74,and extend their shelf life 
5887.72,to turn foods which are not a commodity into a commodity. 
5890.74,Something could be stored and used essentially as a tradable 
5896.31,"purchasable, sellable resource. "
5899.16,"In doing that they change, "
5900.53,they've also decided to change the texture 
5902.6,so that you want to chew more of them. 
5904.77,Like I have this thing 
5905.7,I don't know what it is for those Triscuit crackers. 
5908.9,I don't know why are those things so good? 
5910.16,"It's probably the texture, got those layers, "
5912.33,they're just kind of perfectly salty. 
5913.83,"I haven't had one in a long time, "
5914.84,so I bet if I had one now it wouldn't taste as good 
5916.82,as I'm imagining it. 
5918.04,"But those combinations of texture, smell, and taste "
5922.61,are what combine to activate these different brain areas 
5924.83,that make you really want to desire something. 
5927.47,"And the people who make foods, "
5929.13,"processed foods in particular, "
5930.91,are phenomenally good at figuring out 
5933.63,what drives the dopamine system and makes you want more 
5936.07,of these things either because of the way they taste 
5938.76,and/or because of the way they trigger neurons 
5940.67,in your gut that have nothing to do with taste 
5942.5,that simply make you desire more of the food. 
5944.65,"In other words, many of the foods that are processed foods "
5948.42,"make you desire more of them, "
5950.39,it's impossible to eat one chip kind of thing. 
5953.3,"Not because they taste good, "
5954.61,but because in your gut they're activating the neurons 
5957.66,that activate dopamine 
5958.66,which make you seek more of those foods 
5960.91,independent of blood sugar or anything else. 
5963.87,"So, you may actually be eating more particular foods "
5966.73,"not because they taste good, "
5968.62,"but because they feel good on your tongue and mouth, "
5972.85,and because the neurons in your gut 
5974.83,which are totally independent of conscious taste 
5977.18,are triggering the release of dopamine 
5978.73,"which is a molecule that makes you seek more of, "
5981.37,and do more of anything 
5982.5,that led to the ingestion of that food. 
5985.01,"There's a fun experiment that you can do, "
5987.32,"which is to completely invert your sense of sweet and sour, "
5993.16,there's actually a way to do this readily. 
5994.98,"When I was a post-doc, "
5996.86,"I used to have a journal club at my house, "
5999.01,"people would come over in the evening once a month, "
6001.9,"and we would read a paper, "
6003.2,typically the weirdest paper we could find 
6005.17,"and we would eat food and hang out, "
6008.147,"that's what nerds did and do for fun, "
6011.71,so that's what we did. 
6012.92,And one time someone brought what's called miracle berry. 
6017.53,"Okay, so this isn't some psychedelic plant medicine thing, "
6020.03,"miracle berry, you can purchase online, "
6022.43,it's relatively inexpensive. 
6024.5,It actually causes a change 
6026.47,in the configuration of taste receptors 
6030.11,"such that when you eat something sour, it tastes sweet. "
6033.64,"And so what's really wild is you ingest miracle berry, "
6037.29,"and then you bite into a lemon, "
6039.41,maybe even the lemon and peel 
6040.8,and it tastes as sweet as a peach. 
6043.21,And this effect lasts several hours. 
6046.91,"Definitely, you know, check any warnings, "
6048.5,"I don't know what sort of warnings these, "
6050.08,"a miracle berry carries, "
6051.16,"but I'm sure there's always something, you can imagine. "
6054.66,There are a number of papers on miracle berry 
6056.64,"or miracle fruit it's called, "
6059.36,but it changes your perception of sour 
6062.35,"at a perceptual level, "
6064.5,but it does that by changing the activity 
6067.07,of the receptors in the mouth and tongue. 
6069.59,"Now, this is important as a principle and it's underscored "
6072.41,by experiments that have been done by for instance 
6074.58,"Charles Zuker's lab at Columbia University, "
6076.91,where they've essentially genetically engineered animals 
6080.21,such that the bitter receptor is swapped 
6083.34,"with the sweet receptor, "
6084.45,or the sweet receptor is swapped with the bitter receptor. 
6086.72,"And what they show is that the actual food, "
6090.06,the experience on the tongue 
6092.4,drives different pathways in the brain. 
6095.04,"Here's what they did, they essentially took mice "
6097.73,and swapped out the sweet receptor 
6099.37,and put in a bitter receptor. 
6100.67,And then what they found is that 
6102.08,whereas normally mice would actively seek out 
6105.61,"and even work for sugar water, sucrose, "
6108.27,they really like that. 
6109.54,"If they replace the sweet receptor with the bitter receptor, "
6112.31,the mice would avoid sugar water. 
6113.96,"And the reverse was also true, "
6115.17,"that mice would drink a bitter solution avidly, "
6118.25,they liked a bitter solution 
6119.58,if they swapped out the bitter receptor for sweet receptor. 
6123.06,What this means is that our entire experience 
6125.01,of what we taste is dependent 
6126.38,on how we experience that taste the level of the tongue. 
6129.49,"And so, you're hopefully not going to do genetic engineering "
6132.62,"of your taste receptors, "
6133.84,but if you'd like to do this sort of experiment 
6136.19,"you actually can do it very easily using miracle fruit, "
6138.8,"the instructions of how much to ingest, et cetera, "
6141.72,any safety concerns are usually on the package 
6143.926,and should be easy to find. 
6146.15,"And there's a lot of science to support how this works, "
6148.29,it's kind of a fun experiment that anyone can do 
6151.29,and will completely change your perception 
6153.28,of any food that you're accustomed to eating. 
6155.49,"In fact, you can figure out how much sweet "
6158.8,or the sense of sweetness 
6160.62,"is contributing to your experience of a food, "
6163.02,even if you don't think of it as a sweet food 
6165.0,through this miracle fruit experiment. 
6167.28,"You could take miracle fruit, "
6168.32,"you could eat a slice of pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza, "
6171.24,"which perhaps normally to you would taste just like pizza, "
6174.81,and you'll notice it tastes very different. 
6176.99,What you are detecting is how much the sense of sweet 
6181.27,was contributing to that particular flavor. 
6184.59,"Now, I'd like to return to pheromones. "
6187.91,"As I mentioned earlier, "
6189.13,true pheromonal effects are well-established in animals. 
6192.62,And one of the most remarkable pheromone effects 
6195.12,that's ever been described 
6196.1,"is one that actually I've mentioned before on this podcast, "
6198.33,"but I'll mention again just briefly, "
6200.07,which is the Coolidge effect. 
6201.63,The Coolidge effect is the effect 
6203.6,"of a male of a given species, "
6206.89,"in most cases, it tended to be a rodent or a rooster mating. "
6213.01,And at some point reaching exhaustion 
6215.96,or the inability to mate again 
6218.02,because they just simply couldn't for whatever reason. 
6221.36,The Coolidge effect establishes that if you swap out the hen 
6226.66,"with a new hen, or the female rat or mouse with a new one "
6230.21,then the rat or the rooster 
6233.86,"spontaneously regains their ability to mate, "
6236.4,"somehow their vigor is returned, "
6238.52,the refractory period after mating that normally occurs 
6242.14,is abolished and they can mate again. 
6245.6,It turns out that the Coolidge effect 
6246.95,runs in the opposite direction too. 
6249.06,"I did not know this, but I recently learned of a study, "
6251.6,"it was actually done in hamsters, not in in mice, "
6254.33,"but it turns out that females also will, "
6257.58,female rodents will mate to exhaustion. 
6259.99,And at some port... 
6261.01,"At some point, excuse me, "
6262.22,they will refuse to mate any longer 
6264.13,unless you swap in a new male. 
6266.22,And then because mating in rodents 
6268.61,"involves the female being receptive, "
6270.32,there are certain number of behaviors 
6271.9,that mean that tell you that she's willing 
6274.88,"and wanting to mate, so-called lordosis reflex. "
6279.97,"Then if there's a new male, "
6282.17,she will spontaneously regain the lordosis reflex 
6286.34,and the desire to mate. 
6287.37,And how do you know this? 
6289.55,How do we know it's a pheromonal effect? 
6291.38,"Well, this recovery of the desire and ability to mate "
6295.01,both in males and in females 
6298.28,can be evoked completely by the odor 
6301.61,"of a new male or female, "
6303.6,it doesn't even have to be the presentation 
6305.04,of the actual animal. 
6306.21,And that's how you know 
6307.043,that it's not some visual interaction 
6308.51,"or some other interaction, "
6309.8,it's a pheromonal interaction. 
6312.04,"Now, as I mentioned earlier, pheromonal effects "
6314.16,in humans have been debated for a long period of time. 
6317.64,"We are thought to have a vestigial, "
6319.76,meaning a kind of shrunken down 
6322.97,"miniature accessory olfactory bulb called Jacobson's organ, "
6327.21,or the vomeronasal organ. 
6329.6,"Some people don't believe that Jacobson's organ exists, "
6331.8,"some people do, there is anatomical evidence for it "
6335.22,in some cadavers. 
6337.04,It sits not very high up in the brain 
6341.09,"or where your olfactory bulb is, "
6342.84,"but it's actually in the nasal passages, "
6345.43,so there's like little dents 
6346.72,"as you go up through your nasal passages, "
6348.48,and there is evidence of something that's vomeronasal-like. 
6352.79,"Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ, "
6354.59,"they call it Jacobson's organ if it's present in humans, "
6357.26,kind of tucked into some of the divots in the nasal passage. 
6361.77,"Even if that organ, Jacobson's organ isn't there "
6366.71,or is not responsible 
6367.95,"for the chemical signaling between individuals, "
6370.86,there is chemical signaling between human beings. 
6373.42,"As I mentioned earlier, the effect of tears "
6376.76,in suppressing the areas of the brain 
6378.803,that are involved in sexual desire 
6381.83,"and testosterone of males, that's a concrete result, "
6385.65,that's a very good result published by an excellent group 
6388.56,"with no pre-existing bias going in, "
6390.3,that's just what they found. 
6392.2,There is also evidence 
6395.48,both for and against 
6397.97,chemical signaling between females 
6400.46,in terms of synchronization of menstrual cycles. 
6402.99,"Now, the original paper on this was published in the "
1970s,
6406.85,"by McClintock, and it essentially said "
6410.08,"that when women live together in group housing, dormitories, "
6414.58,and similar that their menstrual cycles were synchronized 
6417.04,and that was due to what was hypothesized 
6418.93,to be pheromonal effects. 
6420.63,"Over the years, "
6421.463,"that study has been challenged many, many times. "
6424.87,The more recent data point to the idea 
6427.81,that there is chemical-chemical signaling between women 
6431.03,"in ways that impact the timing of the menstrual cycle, "
6434.45,but that depending on whether or not 
6437.04,"some of the women are in the ovulation phase, "
6440.01,the ovulatory phase of that cycle 
6441.59,"or whether or not they are in the follicular phase, "
6443.47,the phase when the follicle is maturing 
6446.12,before the egg actually obviates. 
6451.29,So two separate phases of the 
28,day menstrual cycle 
6455.59,will either lengthen or shorten the menstrual cycle 
6459.93,of the person that smells those women. 
6462.03,Translated into English what that means 
6463.65,is that it is very likely it seems 
6466.27,"that something, maybe pheromones, "
6467.99,but maybe some other chemical 
6469.34,that is independent of pheromones is being conveyed 
6472.19,between women that are housed together 
6475.87,or spend a lot of time together 
6477.52,"to shift their menstrual cycle, "
6479.01,but it doesn't necessarily mean that they synchronize. 
6482.16,"So for instance, if one woman is in the follicular phase "
6485.96,"of the menstrual cycle, "
6487.9,it might shorten or delay ovulation. 
6491.66,"Excuse me, it might accelerate ovulation in another woman, "
6494.86,whereas if somebody is in the ovulatory phase 
6497.05,"of their cycle, it might lengthen the menstrual cycle "
6501.12,"out so that they, the woman who smells that person's scent "
6505.71,"or who smells her sweat, "
6507.41,we still don't know the origin of the chemical 
6509.08,would ovulate later. 
6510.6,"So, all of this is to say "
6511.95,is that chemical-chemical signaling is happening 
6514.02,"from females to males through tears, we know that. "
6516.6,Is that a pheromonal effect? 
6518.04,"Well, by the strict definition of a pheromone, "
6520.12,a molecule that's released from one individual 
6522.19,"that impacts the biology of another individual, yes. "
6524.96,"But in terms of identifying what the pheromone is in tears, "
6528.41,"that's still unknown, "
6529.72,it's not clear what the chemical compound is. 
6532.17,"So, we're reluctant as scientists "
6533.96,to call it a true pheromonal effect. 
6535.58,The menstrual cycle and the synchronization 
6538.0,of the menstrual cycle effect seems to hold up 
6540.15,under some conditions. 
6541.06,"But in some cases, "
6542.15,there's a kind of clash of menstrual cycles that's created 
6545.93,by chemicals that are emitted 
6549.14,from one female to another. 
6551.69,"So, there are many examples of this in humans, "
6554.46,"for instance, people can recognize "
6558.15,the t-shirt of their mate. 
6562.09,If you give... 
6562.99,"This experiment has been done many times, "
6564.43,"I know it's been challenged a number of times, "
6565.79,"but the data are pretty good by now that if you offer, "
6569.6,you take a collection of women 
6572.22,"who are in stable relationships with somebody, "
6575.14,you offer them the smell of a hundred different shirts 
6577.73,and they can very readily pick out 
6579.38,their significant others scent. 
6581.35,"Okay, that's pure olfaction, that's not pheromonal, "
6584.01,"but nonetheless is a remarkable degree of discrimination, "
6587.33,olfactory discrimination. 
6589.4,You can dilute their partner's scent 
6593.16,down to the point where they themselves 
6595.27,can't consciously detect the difference 
6597.21,between the sweat or the t-shirt 
6599.25,"of a hundred different t-shirts or so, "
6601.3,"they might say, ""I don't really smell the difference, "
6603.0,but I think it's this one. 
6604.69,"Yeah, this one belongs to the person that I've been with."" "
6607.51,And they are much greater than chance 
6609.16,at detecting the t-shirt 
6610.86,or identifying the t-shirt correctly. 
6612.95,"So, there's no question really "
6614.5,"that there is chemical-chemical signaling between humans, "
6617.86,the question is whether or not 
6619.04,it's truly pheromonal in basis. 
6621.24,"Now, you'll notice that a lot of the examples I gave "
6623.51,aside from the one of tears is women detecting the scents 
6628.58,of men or of other women. 
6631.2,"And it turns out that there are a number of papers, "
6634.83,the best one I think 
6635.81,that I could find is published in Physiology and Behavior 
6639.12,in 
"2009,",it's a review 
6640.49,entitled Sex Differences and Reproductive Hormone Influences 
6643.82,on Human Odor Perception 
6645.75,"by Doty, D-O-T-Y, and Cameron. "
6648.65,I encourage you to check out this review 
6650.07,"it's available free as a download, "
6651.64,"we'll provide a link to it, "
6653.15,you can get the full PDF if you want. 
6655.12,But it does seem that women are better at detecting 
6660.25,odors in these odor discrimination tasks than are men. 
6663.86,"And yes, that it does vary "
6665.37,according to where they are in their menstrual cycle. 
6668.76,"And yes, they also looked at people "
6670.89,"who had received gonadectomy, "
6672.033,"they had their ovaries removed, "
6673.75,a number of different important controls. 
6676.21,"None of this surprises me, "
6677.95,"none of this should surprise you, "
6679.47,it's very clear that hormones have a profound effect 
6682.26,on enlarge number of systems 
6683.88,"in our biology and that smell, and taste, "
6686.7,"and the ability to sense the chemical states of others, "
6689.63,either consciously or subconsciously 
6691.25,have a profound influence 
6692.57,"on whether or not we might want to spend time with them, "
6694.53,whether or not this is somebody 
6695.5,"that we're pair bonded with, "
6696.9,whether or not this is somebody 
6698.27,"that we just met and don't trust yet, things of this sort. "
6702.46,"And given what's at stake in terms of reproductive biology, "
6706.24,"not just offspring, but given the possibility "
6709.73,"of transmission of diseases, et cetera, "
6712.81,"you know, the risks of childbirth, et cetera. "
6717.29,It makes so much sense that much of our biology 
6720.53,is wired toward detecting and sensing whether or not 
6723.41,things and people are things that we should approach 
6726.41,"or avoid, whether or not reproduction "
6729.56,with that person is the appropriate response 
6731.51,or suppression of the reproductive response 
6733.75,"is the appropriate response, right? "
6735.45,As in that's the case with the tears. 
6737.47,"So, I think these are fascinating studies, "
6740.02,"it's an area that still needs a lot of work, "
6742.94,but there are some really wonderful papers on this. 
6745.407,"And the one that I mentioned a few minutes ago, "
6747.23,Sex Differences and Reproductive Hormone Influences 
6749.3,on Human Odor Perception 
6750.95,is one of the better reviews that are out there. 
6754.73,There are also a number of other reviews 
6757.07,for instance that talk about pheromone effects 
6759.53,"and their impact on mood, and sexual responses, "
6763.1,"and things of that sort, "
6763.933,and we will also provide some links to those. 
6765.49,"A lot of this is still speculative, "
6766.98,"but I want to say I know I said it three times, "
6768.463,what I really want to underscore 
6770.21,"because it is vitally important, "
6771.53,and people seem to get a little triggered 
6772.99,by the notion of pheromones. 
6776.17,Just because we haven't identified 
6778.83,the actual chemical compound 
6780.93,that's acting as a pheromone or putative pheromone 
6785.24,does not mean that chemical-chemical signaling 
6787.54,"between individuals doesn't exist, clearly it does. "
6790.89,"Actually, you and every other human "
6793.79,from the time you're born until the time you die 
6795.87,are actively seeking out 
6798.84,and sensing and evaluating 
6802.15,the chemicals that come from other individuals. 
6804.463,There's a really nice study that was done 
6807.61,"by the Weizmann Institute, a group there, "
6809.76,"I think it was also Noam Sobel's group, "
6811.29,but another group as well as I recall 
6813.25,looking at human-human interactions 
6815.51,when they meet for the first time. 
6817.51,It's a remarkable study because what they found 
6820.98,was people would reach out and shake hands. 
6824.42,"It's is a typical response, "
6825.7,"you know pre-pandemic, people would meet, "
6828.12,they'd reach out and they would shake hands. 
6830.22,And what they observed was almost every time 
6834.32,within just a few seconds of having shaken hands 
6838.05,"with this new individual, "
6839.46,people will touch their eyes almost without fail. 
6843.08,"Occasionally, they would touch their eyebrow, "
6844.64,occasionally someone would touch their hair. 
6846.41,We always associate that with people having some sort of... 
6849.8,Or us having some sort of self-conscious response 
6852.3,"like oh, we want to make sure shirt tucked in "
6854.517,"and all prim and proper, whatever it is, "
6856.57,"or looking right, is there something you're like teeth? "
6858.44,"This kind of thing, "
6859.44,but actually people are doing that 
6861.26,even if the person they just met left the room. 
6864.64,"So, someone's sitting there, "
6865.64,"someone comes in, they shake hands, "
6867.62,and the person inevitably subconsciously touches their eyes. 
6871.09,They are taking chemicals from the skin contact 
6874.21,"and they are placing it on a mucosal membrane of some sort, "
6877.3,"typically not up to their nose or in their mouth, "
6879.4,typically on their eyes. 
6880.87,"Now, animals do this all the time, "
6882.27,there's a phenomenon in animals called bunting. 
6884.63,If you have a overeager dog 
6887.02,that when you meet them or you see them again 
6889.33,after you've been away for the day 
6890.44,"they'll rub their head against you, right? "
6892.61,"Cats will do this too, it's called bunting, "
6894.61,"they're rubbing their scent glands on you, "
6896.32,they're marking you. 
6897.78,"And believe it or not, "
6898.79,"you're marking other people when you shake their hand, "
6901.39,and they are then taking your mark 
6903.88,and rubbing it on themselves subconsciously. 
6907.18,"So, we all do these kinds of behaviors, "
6908.97,and now that you're aware of it 
6910.14,"you can watch for it in your environment, "
6911.85,you can pay attention to people. 
6913.92,Some of this has probably changed 
6915.18,in light of the events of 
"2020,","et cetera, "
6917.5,"but nonetheless, we are evaluating "
6920.52,"the molecules on people's breath, "
6922.65,we are evaluating the molecules on people's skin 
6925.15,by actively rubbing it on ourselves. 
6928.56,And we are actively involved 
6930.49,"in sensing not just their facial expressions, "
6932.79,"the size of their pupils, and things like that, "
6934.83,"but the chemicals that they are emitting, "
6936.78,"their hormone status, how they smell. "
6939.06,"We're detecting the pheromones possibly, "
6943.52,but certainly the odors in their breath. 
6945.74,"You might say, ""Well, I don't actually go around "
6947.3,sniffing people's breath. 
6948.53,"I don't, you know, unless if it's bad,"" "
6950.24,"in which case it's aversive, "
6951.27,but breath is communicating a lot of signals. 
6953.61,And this handshake eye rub experiment 
6956.35,shows that we are actively going through behaviors 
6959.62,reflexively to wipe ourselves 
6962.14,or smear ourselves with other people's chemicals. 
6964.74,"Now, that might seem odd or even gross to you, "
6967.58,"but I think it's beautiful, "
6969.47,I think that it illustrates 
6971.09,the extent to which we as human beings 
6973.09,are in some ways among the other animals 
6975.84,"in our subconscious, sometimes conscious, "
6978.18,but certainly subconscious 
6980.12,tendency to try and evaluate our chemical environment 
6983.02,"through what we inhale through our nose, "
6985.2,"what we ingest through our mouth, "
6987.45,and what we actively take off other people's skin 
6991.49,and rub on ourselves to evaluate it 
6994.52,"and what we should do about it, "
6995.96,and perhaps that person as well. 
6998.17,"So today, we talked a lot about olfaction taste "
7001.0,and chemical sensing between individuals. 
7003.36,I'd like to think that you now know a lot 
7005.43,about how your smell system works 
7007.37,and why inhaling is a really good thing to do in general 
7011.49,"for waking up your brain, and for cognitive function, "
7014.06,and for enhancing your sense of smell. 
7015.91,"We talked about how to enhance your sense of taste, "
7018.31,and we talked about chemical signaling 
7020.14,between individuals as a way of communicating 
7022.5,some important aspects about biology. 
7024.82,People are shaping each other's biology all the time 
7027.41,by way of these chemicals that are being traded 
7029.47,from one body to the next 
7031.06,"through air, and skin to skin contact, and tears. "
