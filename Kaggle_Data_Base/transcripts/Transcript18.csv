0.36,- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast 
2.28,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.92,for everyday life. 
6.123,[MUSIC PLAYING] 
9.09,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.08,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.08,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.94,"Today, we are discussing meditation. "
17.34,"We are going to discuss the science of meditation, "
19.74,"that is, what happens in the brain and body "
21.84,"while we are meditating, "
23.52,and we will talk about the science of meditation 
25.56,as it relates to how the brain and body change 
28.08,"as a consequence of meditation, "
29.85,"that is, what you export or take from a meditation practice "
33.45,that can impact everything from your sleep to your mood. 
36.72,"For instance, meditation has been shown "
38.49,to alleviate symptoms of depression. 
40.98,And we will also talk about how meditation 
42.9,can be used to enhance focus and other states of mind 
46.02,that are useful for work and other aspects of life. 
49.02,"Now, of course, most of you "
49.86,"have probably heard of meditation, "
51.15,"and when we think of meditation, "
52.74,"most often, we think of somebody "
54.36,either sitting or lying down. 
55.98,"If they're sitting, we might imagine them "
57.63,"in the so-called lotus position, "
58.92,"you know, sitting with legs crossed, very upright, "
60.81,"with hands on the knees or, you know, crossed in our lap "
63.57,or something of that sort. 
64.95,"Typically, we think of somebody who is in a very calm state, "
67.62,"eyes closed, focused on their so-called third eye center. "
71.13,The third eye center is the area just behind one's forehead. 
74.19,"There's no third eye there, at least there shouldn't be, "
78.0,but I'll tell you why it's called the third eye center 
80.82,and what the origins of that are 
82.14,"and why it's relevant, actually, for a meditative practice. "
85.2,"With all that said, it turns out that meditation "
87.24,encompasses a huge variety of different practices. 
90.39,Some of those practices indeed are done sitting 
92.49,"or lying down with one's eyes closed, "
94.29,focusing on the third eye center. 
95.94,"Other of those practices are focused on a body scan, "
99.15,"you know, really focusing on one area of the body "
101.4,and its contact with whatever surface 
103.2,you happen to be sitting or lying on 
105.03,or can be done walking. 
107.04,"In fact, there are walking meditations done with eyes open. "
110.25,"So there are many different forms of meditation, "
112.11,"but today, we are going to focus "
113.28,mainly on how specific types of meditation 
115.74,and specific areas of the brain 
117.84,that are activated during those meditations 
120.12,"change our way of being in fundamental ways, "
122.91,"not just during the meditation practice, "
124.89,but afterwards as well. 
126.93,So if you're somebody who's interested 
128.49,in changing your default state of mood or of thinking 
132.0,or enhancing your ability to focus 
133.74,or improving your sleep or improving performance 
136.59,"in some cognitive or physical endeavor, "
138.78,"meditation is powerful, "
140.19,but you want to make sure 
141.12,that you pick the right meditation practice. 
143.55,So we will talk about picking a meditation practice 
146.46,that isn't just feasible because you'll do it 
148.65,but is actually directed at the goals specific to you 
152.43,and what you need most. 
153.81,"So to give you some sense of the contour of today's episode, "
156.51,"first, I'm going to talk about "
157.343,"some of the underlying biology, "
159.06,the mechanisms and the brain areas 
161.64,and also the areas of the body that are activated 
165.3,"during certain forms of meditation, "
166.92,"and, equally important, "
167.76,which areas of the brain and body 
168.93,are shut down or reduced in their activity 
171.09,during specific types of meditation. 
173.34,Then I'll transition 
174.45,"into how to best do a meditation practice, "
177.12,"how to get the most out of that meditation practice, "
179.79,and then I will talk about how to change 
181.83,or alter your meditation practices 
183.84,according to your specific goals 
185.43,and as you get better at meditation. 
187.53,"And this can get a little bit counterintuitive, "
189.21,but in a positive way. 
190.56,"What I mean by that is, for instance, a lot of people think "
192.99,"that as you meditate and get better at meditating, "
195.3,"you need to meditate more and more and more, "
197.61,sort of like if you get better at running endurance races 
200.07,"that you need to keep running longer and longer, "
201.78,"you know, first a "
"5K,",then a 
"10K,",
203.76,"then a marathon, then ultras. "
205.53,"With meditation, it's actually quite the opposite. "
207.69,The better that you get 
209.22,at dropping into a particular brain state 
212.22,"and the more your so-called traits of brain state shift, "
215.7,"not just states as they're sometimes referred to, "
217.86,"but traits, this is a theme that I've picked up "
219.75,"from a terrific book that I'll refer to later, "
222.9,but the more that you can get 
224.16,"into specific neural circuits quickly, "
227.43,"actually, the less you need to meditate "
230.28,in order to derive the benefits of meditation. 
233.1,So that's a wonderful aspect of meditative practices 
235.5,that's unlike a lot of other forms of mental exercise 
239.28,and cognitive enhancing exercises. 
241.32,"So we'll talk about all of that today, "
242.88,"and I promise that by the end of today's episode, "
245.19,you will have a rich array of meditative practices 
247.56,"to select from, "
248.393,you'll know why each of them work 
249.93,and why they can be directed toward particular goals 
252.33,"and how to do that, "
253.59,and you'll also know 
254.423,how to modify those meditation practices 
256.98,under conditions where you might get busier 
258.84,"or where you're suffering from lack of sleep, "
260.607,and I think a lot of people will be excited to know 
262.47,that today we're going to discuss 
263.91,a specific form of meditation 
265.41,that can indeed reduce your need for sleep 
268.29,and still allow you to enhance your cognitive 
270.99,and physical abilities. 
272.37,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
274.98,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
277.77,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
279.96,to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information 
281.88,about science and science-related tools 
283.92,to the general public. 
285.15,"In keeping with that theme, "
286.29,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
289.02,Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. 
291.359,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
293.7,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
296.31,to help you better understand your body 
297.99,and help you meet your health goals. 
299.52,"Now, I've long been a believer "
300.54,in getting regular blood work done 
302.22,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
304.47,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
306.57,can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. 
309.03,One issue with a lot of blood tests 
310.53,"and DNA tests out there, however, "
311.94,is that you get information back 
313.29,"about hormones, blood lipids, et cetera, "
315.54,but you don't know what to do with that information. 
317.28,InsideTracker makes understanding all of that very easy 
319.86,"and, even better, points to specific directives, "
322.68,"that is, things you can do in terms of your lifestyle, "
324.87,"your nutrition, supplementation, et cetera, "
327.03,in order to bring those numbers 
328.5,"related to metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera, "
331.35,"into the ranges that are optimal for you, "
333.6,your immediate and long-term health. 
335.64,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "
337.35,you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman 
340.17,to get 
20%,off any of InsideTracker's plans. 
342.66,That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get

346.38,Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. 
349.02,"Thesis makes custom nootropics, "
350.85,"and to be honest, I am not a fan of the word nootropics. "
353.67,I've said this many times before 
354.81,"on this podcast and other podcasts, "
356.61,and the reason I don't like the word nootropics 
358.5,is that it means smart drugs. 
360.75,"And as a neuroscientist, "
362.49,"I'm aware that there are neural circuits, "
364.2,"that is, connections in the brain and body "
366.27,that underlie things like focus 
367.95,"or our ability to switch tasks or creativity, et cetera. "
372.0,There is no neural circuit for being smart. 
374.64,"And so Thesis understands this, "
376.59,"and as a consequence, they've developed custom nootropics "
379.02,that are designed to bring your brain and body 
380.97,"into specific states to become, for instance, more focused "
384.45,or to engage in creative work 
386.25,or to have more energy for workouts and things of that sort. 
389.52,"At Thesis, you can go there, you take a brief quiz, "
392.04,and they will design a kit 
393.6,of four different custom nootropics that you can try 
395.88,and then modify along with their help 
397.83,so that you can develop a kit of custom nootropics 
400.17,that are perfect for your needs. 
402.24,"Perhaps one for creativity, another one for motivation, "
404.67,"another one for focus, and another one for energy. "
406.98,They'll build those for you. 
408.42,"To get your own personalized nootropics starter kit, "
410.37,you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman. 
413.1,"Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman "

419.43,Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. 
421.89,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses 
423.81,that are of the absolute highest quality. 
425.97,The company was founded 
426.803,"by two all-American swimmers from Stanford, "
428.76,and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses 
431.1,were designed with performance in mind. 
433.35,"Now, I spent a lifetime working on the visual system, "
435.21,and I can tell you that your visual system 
436.47,has to contend with an enormous number of challenges 
439.02,in order for you to be able to see clearly. 
440.82,ROKA understands this 
441.81,and has designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses 
443.94,to be worn in any number of different conditions 
446.13,and for you to still be able to see with crystal clarity 
448.95,They were designed for things like cycling and running 
451.29,"so they won't slip off your face if they get sweaty, "
453.15,they're extremely lightweight. 
454.2,"In fact, most of the time, "
455.07,"I can't even remember that they're on my face, "
456.48,they're so lightweight. 
457.313,"However, they also can be worn anywhere, "
459.33,"to work, to dinner, et cetera. "
460.8,"They have a terrific aesthetic, "
461.91,unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there 
463.743,that you can only find in designs 
465.57,that really make people look like a cyborg. 
467.25,"ROKA makes the cyborg versions, some people like those, "
469.47,but they also make versions 
471.21,of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with frames 
473.37,"that you can wear out to dinner, to work, et cetera. "
476.04,"If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, "
478.2,"go to roka.com, that's roka.com, "
480.93,and enter the code Huberman 
482.43,to save 
20%,off your first order. 
484.41,"Again, that's ROKA, roka.com "
486.66,and enter the code Huberman at checkout. 
488.58,The Huberman Lab podcast 
489.69,is now partnered with Momentous supplements. 
491.52,To find the supplements we discuss 
492.87,"on the Huberman Lab podcast, "
494.07,"you can go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, "
497.01,livemomentous.com/huberman. 
498.957,And I should just mention that the library 
500.67,of those supplements is constantly expanding. 
502.86,"Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. "
505.95,Let's talk about meditation. 
507.33,"As I mentioned earlier, "
508.59,we are going to talk about what areas of the brain and body 
511.26,are active during meditation and after meditation 
514.17,and why that can be so beneficial. 
516.24,We will also talk about when and how best to meditate. 
519.153,"Now, this is a topic I've long been interested in. "
521.94,I was first given a book on meditation 
523.71,when I was in high school 
525.18,"because, to make a long story short, "
527.16,"I was a bit of a wild one early in my high school years, "
530.13,"and as a consequence of a program that I was in, "
533.85,somebody handed me a book on meditation. 
536.37,That book is still available now. 
538.32,"That book is called ""Wherever You Go, There you Are"" "
540.78,by Jon Kabat-Zinn. 
542.43,"He was one of the first, not the only, "
544.32,but one of the first people 
545.7,to really start popularizing meditation 
547.407,and mindfulness practices in the United States. 
550.68,So this was in the late 
"1980s,",
553.35,and it was really only until recently 
556.02,"that there were very few studies of meditation, "
558.6,although those really picked up in the '
90s.,
560.94,"Now you can find many, many thousands of studies "
564.54,"on meditation and their mechanistic basis, "
566.46,"so brain imaging studies, changes in hormones in the body. "
569.4,But in the late 
1980s,and in the early 
"1990s,",
572.76,"because functional imaging of the brain, "
574.74,"so-called MRI or fMRI, was really just starting to emerge "
578.82,"as a popular tool in laboratories and hospitals, "
581.67,there really wasn't that much mechanistic understanding 
583.77,"about how meditation worked, "
585.24,"but, of course, there was a deep understanding "
587.58,from cultures outside the United States 
590.19,that meditation was extremely useful. 
592.62,"I should just mention, "
593.49,"as long as we're talking about the history of meditation, "
596.01,any discussion about meditation 
598.11,"is going to be a discussion about states of mind, "
600.78,and any discussion about states of mind 
602.79,"invokes the word consciousness, "
604.26,a kind of a dangerous topic to get into in any format 
607.92,"because a lot of people talk about consciousness, "
611.01,"but people use consciousness, the word, "
614.07,to mean different things. 
615.18,It doesn't have one standard operational definition 
617.7,as scientists call it. 
619.47,"However, discussions about consciousness "
622.17,are often part and parcel with conversations 
625.08,about things like psychedelics 
627.0,and kind of alternative therapies. 
628.89,And so in the 
1960s,and especially in the 
"1970s,",
632.01,meditation and psychedelics were actually close cousins 
635.91,in the conversation about consciousness and states of mind. 
639.21,That conversation started to split 
641.94,"into two different divisions, "
643.53,and I'll explain why in a moment. 
645.6,It gets to a little bit of interesting academic sociology. 
648.57,But what happened was there were a couple of guys 
650.58,"at Harvard, including Timothy Leary and others, "
654.21,"who got really interested in psychedelics, "
656.58,"in particular LSD, lysergic acid diethylamide. "
660.18,"And at that time, "
661.41,"that was part of the whole counterculture movement, "
663.36,"it was considered very anti-establishment, "
665.4,and they were really encouraging students at Harvard 
668.58,to take LSD. 
670.62,They were also very interested in meditation. 
672.81,But what ended up happening 
673.89,"is they essentially got kicked out or fired from Harvard, "
676.92,and there's a book that I'll refer you to 
678.63,in the show note captions 
679.71,if you're interested in learning more about all this. 
681.33,But they got kicked out and fired 
682.71,for their emphasis on psychedelics. 
684.78,"Now, nowadays, there's a lot of interest in psychedelics. "
687.72,We've had episodes with Dr. Matthew Johnson 
690.06,from Johns Hopkins University who's running clinical trials 
692.67,on psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD 
694.65,for the treatment of depression and PTSD. 
697.05,"We've also had Dr. Nolan Williams on the podcast, "
699.72,my colleague at Stanford who's doing incredible studies 
702.48,on some of those compounds as well. 
704.1,"So nowadays, the conversation about psychedelics "
706.02,"is coming back, "
707.07,and it's somewhat divorced 
708.66,"from the conversation about meditation, "
710.73,but in the 
1960s,and 
"1970s,",
713.49,the conversation about psychedelics and meditation 
715.89,was sort of one and the same. 
718.62,That changed in the late 
1980s,and early 
1990s,
722.79,when people like Jon Kabat-Zinn 
724.35,started writing books that were purely about meditation 
727.26,and suggesting that people explore meditative practices 
730.05,"for the utility to bring calmness, "
731.85,"adjust stress, improve sleep, et cetera, "
734.91,divorced from the conversation about psychedelics. 
737.49,"Now, that's not to say that the scientific community "
739.65,immediately embraced the conversation about meditation. 
742.32,"In fact, it took quite a long while "
744.72,for schools like Harvard and Stanford 
747.18,and other universities around the world 
748.8,"to start embracing and funding studies of meditation, "
753.06,"asking what sorts of brain areas are involved, "
755.1,"how it changes the body, "
756.36,"and, perhaps most importantly, "
757.98,how a meditation practice can shift the brain and body 
760.59,when somebody is finished meditating 
762.63,and is off in their life doing their everyday things. 
765.75,In the late 
1980s,and especially within the 
"1990s,",
769.74,the advent of brain imaging technology 
771.48,"like magnetic residence imaging, MRI, "
774.24,or functional magnetic residence imaging 
776.1,"was a way to look at the brain while it was active, "
779.61,"not just to get an image of its structure, "
781.44,but also how it's functioning 
782.73,in the areas that so-called light up. 
784.53,"When all of that technology became accessible and popular, "
787.62,"well, that allowed a large number of laboratories "
789.78,to start asking how specific patterns 
792.54,"of thinking and breathing, "
794.04,"maybe people sitting in the lotus position, "
795.75,"but more often than that, "
796.68,it would be people inside of an MRI magnet 
799.08,"because it is a magnet, "
799.95,they sort of put you into a little tube 
801.18,"and push you into the tube, not against your will of course, "
804.54,"but put people into the tube, have them meditate, "
807.18,and then look at how the brain changed 
809.07,and to do that over time. 
810.6,"When those studies were done, "
812.1,"what was discovered was really quite miraculous, really. "
815.7,"And now we don't think of it as surprising, "
817.68,but what was discovered 
818.94,was a huge laundry list of brain changes. 
821.79,"And then when people were evaluated in their outside life, "
825.27,so when they would fill out reports 
827.13,of their subjective feelings of happiness 
828.81,"or they would report their sleep, "
830.07,or even if objective measures were taken 
832.41,like changes in hormones 
833.76,"or markers of inflammation, et cetera, "
836.28,a large list of information fell out of that 
840.27,"which revealed that indeed there are many, "
843.06,a dozen or more clear benefits 
845.76,"of a regular meditation practice, "
847.65,and some of those meditation practices could be quite short. 
850.95,"So nowadays, we think of meditation "
852.8,"as pretty commonly accepted, "
854.22,"and in fact, that has a lot to do with the fact "
856.83,that many of the major tech companies 
859.05,in the Bay Area during the 
2000s,such as Google and Apple 
863.22,and any number of different social media companies 
865.68,"and other companies and business ventures, et cetera, "
868.17,and investment firms all over the world 
870.6,started hiring people to train meditation 
873.09,or had online courses for meditation. 
875.58,"So nowadays, we think of meditation as this thing "
877.86,"that almost everybody understands can benefit us, "
881.22,but we now sit at an interesting frontier 
884.28,"where most people think of meditation as one thing, "
887.55,"sort of like the word exercise, "
888.81,"which, of course, could mean weight training, "
890.37,"it could mean running, "
891.203,"it could mean high-intensity interval training, "
893.43,"all of which, as you know, will get you different results "
896.94,"depending on what you do, how often you do it, "
899.07,and the specifics of what you actually do. 
901.77,"So, too, meditation can give you very specific results. "
905.55,"It can give you more focus, it can give you better sleep, "
908.45,it can give you a combination of results 
910.14,just like exercise can depending on the exercise. 
913.05,So what we are going to talk about next 
914.61,is the specific changes that happen in the brain 
917.4,with specific aspects of meditation. 
919.68,"That is, what happens when you close your eyes, "
922.2,what happens when you focus your attention inward 
924.93,versus focusing your attention outward 
926.58,"because, as I mentioned before, "
927.99,there's third eye meditation where you close your eyes 
929.85,and focus on that spot just behind your forehead 
932.13,and you focus on your breathing. 
933.6,There's also meditation practices 
935.13,where you're focusing on what you're eating 
936.63,"with a lot of so-called mindfulness, "
938.28,"being very present to whatever's happening, "
940.17,not letting your mind wander 
941.61,or think about yesterday or tomorrow 
943.83,"or what's happening next, "
944.88,but really focusing on the present. 
947.25,"There are also meditation practices, of course, "
949.44,where you are in a format of interpersonal communication 
952.77,where you're really listening very intensely. 
954.84,"That, too, is a form of mindfulness. "
956.64,"So we're going to parse each of these things, "
958.32,and we are going to ask 
959.46,what's happening in the brain and body 
960.9,during each of these meditation practices 
963.0,so that you can develop specific meditation practices 
965.91,that you can invoke in your real life on a daily basis 
969.3,"or, thankfully, I would say, for some who are pretty busy, "
973.14,that you could even do once a week or even once a month 
975.93,that will still clearly benefit you in specific ways. 
979.38,I'd like to spend the next 
10,minutes or so 
981.51,"talking about the neuroscience of meditation, "
983.817,and I promise you I'm not going to just list off 
986.04,a bunch of different brain areas 
987.27,that are active during meditation. 
988.71,That wouldn't be useful to you. 
989.76,"In fact, I don't believe "
991.11,in throwing out a lot of nomenclature 
992.91,without also giving some mechanistic explanation 
995.88,as to what different brain areas do. 
997.857,"And you could say, ""Well, what good is it knowing "
999.99,what different brain areas do and their names 
1001.82,"if I can't actually manipulate those brain areas?"" "
1003.98,But the good news 
1004.813,is you actually can manipulate those brain areas. 
1007.37,"As I'll tell you today, "
1008.24,you can turn up the activity in certain brain areas 
1011.33,and turn down the activity in specific brain areas 
1014.06,"with specific elements of a meditation practice, "
1016.88,so that's quite exciting and quite different really 
1019.31,from other aspects of neuroscience 
1020.96,that we might discuss on this podcast. 
1023.15,So there are a few different brain areas 
1025.13,whose names I'd like to arm you with. 
1027.23,"And again, the names themselves aren't essential, "
1030.26,but if you can grasp even the top contour 
1032.3,"of what I'm about to say, "
1033.26,you'll be in a much better position 
1034.58,to parse and use the information that follows. 
1038.18,There's an area of your brain 
1039.41,that sits right behind your forehead 
1041.3,that's called the prefrontal cortex. 
1043.28,"Basically, it's the front bumper of your head "
1045.65,"just behind the bone, okay? "
1047.69,That area just behind your forehead 
1049.01,that we call the prefrontal cortex 
1050.72,actually encompasses a lot of different things. 
1052.91,"And actually, you have two of them. "
1054.8,You have one on the right side of your brain 
1056.48,"and you have one on the left side of your brain, "
1058.28,and they're connected to one another 
1059.51,but they actually do different things. 
1061.43,The area that I'd like to focus on today for a bit 
1064.1,"is the so-called left prefrontal cortex, "
1066.98,"or if we were going to get really specific, "
1068.84,we'd say the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
1071.69,"Dorsal means up, lateral means to the side, "
1074.45,so if you want to touch the left side of your head 
1076.52,"and move your hand just toward the midline, "
1078.86,"toward the sort of top of your head a little bit, "
1081.05,"so that's dorsal, and then lateral, "
1083.06,"as long as your hand is still on the side of your head, "
1084.62,"you're in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, okay? "
1087.65,So you've got your hand probably right over 
1089.66,your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
1092.54,"That area of the brain, we know from lesion studies "
1095.3,where it's been damaged in animals or humans 
1097.67,and we know from stimulation studies 
1099.92,"where it's been selectively stimulated in animals, "
1103.13,"or yes, indeed, also it's been done in humans, "
1106.82,has an incredible ability to control your bodily senses 
1111.47,"and to make sense, that is, to interpret what's going on "
1115.34,in terms of your emotions and your bodily sensations. 
1118.49,"So from now on, unless I say otherwise, "
1120.83,"if I say prefrontal cortex, I'm specifically referring "
1123.74,"to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, "
1125.99,but I'm going to shorten that up 
1127.13,just for sake of simplicity and ease of communication. 
1129.98,"If I'm going to talk about another area of prefrontal cortex, "
1132.08,"I'll talk about another area, "
1133.19,"but if I say prefrontal cortex today, "
1134.99,what I mean is left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
1137.96,Stimulation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
1140.78,"or, I should say more appropriately, "
1142.52,"when your left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is active, "
1147.53,you are in a great position 
1149.99,"to interpret what's going on with you emotionally, "
1153.26,"to interpret your bodily signals of comfort or discomfort, "
1157.58,and then to make really good decisions 
1159.38,on the basis of that interpretation. 
1162.32,And that's because the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
1166.01,is in direct communication with 
1167.96,and is directly connected to another brain area 
1171.65,"called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC. "
1175.04,"Now, I'm just going to refer to it as the ACC, okay? "
1178.52,The ACC is an area of your brain 
1181.34,that is interpreting a lot of different things 
1183.35,"about bodily signals, "
1184.73,"for instance, how fast you're breathing, "
1188.3,"whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly, "
1191.9,"and, more importantly, "
1193.04,whether or not your heart is beating quickly or slowly 
1195.53,for the circumstance that you are in. 
1197.66,"So for instance, if you're running up a hill "
1199.52,and you're even in great shape 
1202.04,"and your heart is beating very fast, "
1204.08,it's unlikely that you are going to be concerned 
1206.87,about your heart beating fast 
1208.55,because that is appropriate for the circumstance. 
1210.8,"However, if you're just walking along "
1212.69,"and all of a sudden, your heart starts beating very quickly "
1214.52,"for no apparent reason, "
1217.52,"well, then you are going to interpret that "
1219.5,"as either pathologic or uncomfortable, "
1223.1,inappropriate for the context that you happen to be in. 
1227.63,The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
1230.09,is the area of the brain 
1231.08,that actually has some control over 
1233.48,and especially can interpret 
1235.49,what's going on in this ACC region. 
1238.7,"Now, most of you probably haven't heard of the ACC. "
1241.19,Most of you probably have heard of a brain area 
1243.5,called the amygdala. 
1244.34,It's an almond-shaped structure 
1245.75,"on the two sides of the brain, "
1246.8,"people talk about it as the fear center, et cetera. "
1249.14,"But your ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex, "
1252.23,"gets input from areas like the amygdala, "
1254.24,"your threat detection centers, "
1255.38,but it also gets input from an enormous number 
1258.65,"of other areas of your brain and body, "
1260.51,"including your heart, your gut, "
1263.9,"so it gets information about how full, "
1266.75,"that is, distended, or how empty your gut is. "
1269.69,It gets information about how quickly you're breathing 
1271.97,from input from your lungs and related structures. 
1276.47,It's an absolutely critical station 
1278.99,"for making sense of what's going on in your body, "
1281.24,and it works very closely along with one other structure. 
1284.087,And I promise this is going to be the third structure 
1286.52,"in this triad, and then I'll stop listing off names. "
1288.98,So we have dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
1290.51,Think of that as sort of the interpreter 
1291.98,of what's going on inside of you. 
1293.9,"You have the ACC, or anterior cingulate cortex, "
1296.9,which is the area of your brain 
1298.1,that's bringing in all this information 
1300.11,about what's going on inside your body 
1302.27,and even on the surface of your body. 
1303.98,"You know, if you have any pain or an itch "
1305.69,"or a mosquito bite on the surface of your body, "
1307.31,your ACC would definitely register that. 
1309.912,And then there's this other 
1310.79,absolutely incredible brain structure 
1312.44,"which is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A, insula, "
1315.8,and the insula has a bunch of different parts to it. 
1318.14,But the insula is another area that is interpreting signals 
1322.4,"of what's going on in your brain and body, "
1325.22,so the ACC and the insula are working together 
1327.35,"to try and figure out, you know, what's going on inside me? "
1330.29,"And in addition to that, "
1331.7,the insula is interpreting information 
1333.77,about what's going on outside of you. 
1336.29,"So your insula is saying, for instance, "
1338.603,"hey, this is a steep hill that I'm running up, "
1340.94,"and as a consequence, "
1342.29,whatever heart rate increase that I'm experiencing 
1344.81,"or heavy breathing or burning in my lungs, "
1346.73,this all makes sense. 
1347.9,"I don't have to be worried, I don't have to be scared. "
1349.64,"I might want to slow down, but this makes sense. "
1352.13,"Whereas, for instance, in the example I previously gave, "
1354.86,where if you're sitting in a room 
1356.48,"and everything is pretty calm, "
1358.13,"and all of a sudden, you start feeling really uncomfortable, "
1360.65,like your stomach doesn't feel right 
1362.0,or you start breathing quickly 
1363.13,"or you start having a so-called anxiety or panic attack, "
1366.38,"in large part, that's because the shift "
1368.84,in your bodily sensations doesn't match 
1371.39,or doesn't correspond to something in the outside world. 
1374.27,So there's this incredible triad 
1375.95,"which includes the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, "
1378.8,"the cingulate or anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula, "
1381.95,and those three are working together 
1383.96,"in a kind of conversation, "
1385.22,"it's a neural conversation, but a conversation nonetheless, "
1388.13,"trying to figure out, okay, what's going on inside me? "
1390.74,How do I feel? What am I thinking about? 
1393.17,And this could be thoughts about the past 
1394.64,or the future or the present. 
1397.07,They are also in a conversation 
1399.17,as to whether or not the sensations 
1401.18,"that you're experiencing, "
1402.71,meaning how quick your breathing is 
1404.39,"or how slow your breathing is, "
1405.92,"how your heart feels, how your skin feels, "
1409.04,"any sensations of pain, or pleasure for that matter, "
1412.64,whether or not that makes sense for the situation you're in 
1415.04,and trying to determine 
1416.03,whether or not you are doing the right things 
1418.67,as a consequence of those sensations. 
1421.34,"Okay, so again, if you can't remember the names "
1424.22,"of these different neural structures in the brain, "
1425.99,don't worry about it. 
1426.89,It's really not that critical. 
1428.36,What is critical is that you understand 
1430.64,that there's a conversation that's constantly occurring 
1433.97,as long as you are awake 
1435.74,trying to figure out what's going on inside of you 
1439.1,and whether or not it makes sense 
1440.42,relative to what's going on outside and around you. 
1443.57,"Now, humans are smart. "
1444.92,"That is, we are, to some extent, conscious of the fact "
1448.82,"that we have memories of the past, awareness of the present, "
1453.29,and anticipation of the future. 
1455.39,"So we do realize, for instance, "
1457.34,"that we can be seated at the dinner table, excuse me, "
1460.13,"and have a thought about something tomorrow, "
1462.86,maybe an exam that's stressing us out 
1464.96,"or something like that, "
1465.793,and that will change our bodily state 
1467.99,in a way that is not optimal 
1469.85,for what we're doing in the moment 
1471.59,but that can still make sense to us 
1473.09,"because that exam is important, "
1474.44,maybe we're feeling some pressure 
1475.67,"about a hard conversation we have to have, "
1477.35,or maybe we are very excited about the next day 
1480.02,"and we can't eat because we're so excited, "
1482.48,and that can make perfect sense to us 
1483.86,because we do have access to this knowledge about self 
1487.16,"that we can think about the past, "
1488.93,"the present, or the future. "
1490.61,So that makes the conversation these three structures are in 
1493.88,even more interesting and dynamic 
1495.89,"because what it means is that we can be doing something, "
1499.85,"eating, talking, running, "
1502.31,"any number of different activities, "
1504.44,and our bodily state may or may not match what we are doing 
1509.12,"in a way that's adaptive for that, "
1511.58,and yet that can be completely okay 
1513.01,or at least understandable for us. 
1516.47,"Now, a major emphasis of a meditation practice "
1519.86,is to make us so-called more mindful. 
1523.1,What is mindfulness? 
1524.06,"Well, again, there isn't one perfect "
1525.68,universally accepted operational definition of mindfulness. 
1529.34,That's basically nerd speak 
1530.48,for saying people can't agree exactly what mindfulness 
1533.93,"should be, is, and means for everyone. "
1538.1,"But most people assume, and I think agree, "
1540.62,that mindfulness includes something about being present. 
1544.88,"And when I say present, "
1545.93,that doesn't necessarily mean present to one's surroundings 
1548.66,because of course a lot of meditation practices 
1550.82,that are designed to make us more mindful and present 
1553.19,are designed to make us more mindful and present 
1554.84,to what's happening internally 
1556.55,"while ignoring everything that's happening externally, "
1559.97,but they are designed to make us more present 
1562.37,to our bodily sensations 
1563.81,"and, in particular, our breathing and our thoughts "
1566.69,in the moment. 
1567.98,So let's now explore 
1569.45,"what a generic meditation practice looks like, "
1571.61,and let's evaluate how that tends to change the activity 
1575.09,of these neural circuits in the brain and body. 
1576.92,"And then from there, we can split the conversation "
1579.5,"into a couple of different bins, "
1581.12,"that is, meditation practices that are ideal "
1584.0,"for enhancing focus, "
1585.68,"meditation practices that are ideal for improving mood, "
1588.89,"meditation practices that are ideal for improving sleep, "
1592.52,"and meditation practices that, believe it or not, "
1596.09,benefit all of those things in one fell swoop. 
1599.09,"Okay, so what happens during a meditation practice "
1601.31,at the neural level? 
1602.9,"In order to answer that question, "
1604.61,we are going to be scientists. 
1605.96,That means you and I are going to be scientists now. 
1608.51,We are going to break down a practice 
1610.49,into its different component parts 
1613.04,and address what we know for sure 
1616.16,about the brain activation states that occur 
1619.07,with those different component parts. 
1620.75,"In order to do that, "
1621.583,"let's use a somewhat generic form of meditation, "
1623.96,but it's generic and pretty far-reaching 
1626.39,"because I would say that for most people, "
1629.54,about 
"75%,","let's say, "
1632.3,"a meditation practice is going to involve stopping, "
1635.6,"meaning getting out of motion, sitting or lying down, "
1641.51,"and, in most cases, closing one's eyes, "
1644.12,although it is absolutely not required 
1647.03,to close one's eyes during meditation. 
1648.68,There are many forms of meditation that are done eyes open. 
1652.28,"But for most people, "
1653.21,"it's going to involve stopping our movement, "
1655.73,"that is, not ambulating, not walking or running, "
1658.13,so seated or lying down with eyes closed. 
1662.12,"When we do that, "
1662.96,"meaning when we sit or lie down and close our eyes, "
1666.11,"as trivial as that shift might sound to you, "
1668.84,it actually is a profound shift in the way that your brain 
1672.74,and other neural circuits in your body function 
1675.98,for the following reason. 
1677.93,"When we close our eyes, "
1680.12,we shut down a major avenue of what's called exteroception. 
1685.4,What do I mean by exteroception? 
1687.08,"Well, very briefly, we are sensing things on our body "
1691.64,and in our body all the time. 
1693.26,"We are also sensing things from outside of us all the time, "
1695.93,"so these could be sights or sounds, touch on our body, "
1698.93,"sensations withinside our body, et cetera. "
1701.48,"Now, sensation is distinct from what we call perception. "
1705.05,"Perception is, put simply, "
1708.68,the sensations that we happen to be paying attention to. 
1712.1,"So at any given moment, you are sensing many, many things. "
1715.01,"There are sound waves hitting your ears, "
1716.48,there are pressure receptors on the bottoms of your feet 
1718.88,"sensing your shoes or your sandals or the floor, et cetera, "
1722.0,but you're not perceiving them 
1723.44,until you place your attention on them. 
1725.87,"Now, the way perception works "
1728.63,is that you have so-called spotlights of attention. 
1731.57,"You can't perceive everything all at once, "
1735.26,"every sound, every sight, every touch. "
1737.24,"That would be overwhelming. In fact, that would be terrible. "
1739.67,Rather you have spotlights of perception 
1742.55,"that can either be very narrow, "
1744.53,"so for instance, "
1745.363,you could focus all of your perception right now 
1747.62,on your big toe of your right foot 
1749.72,"and really pour all of your awareness, your attention "
1753.8,"into what you're perceiving there, what it feels like, "
1756.38,"if there's tingling or pressure, heat or cold, et cetera, "
1759.98,or you can broaden that spotlight to include both feet 
1763.07,or all your toes on both feet 
1764.66,and then your legs and your whole body or the entire room. 
1767.9,"Perception is like a spotlight, "
1769.43,and I should mention there are very good data 
1771.77,that we can split our attention into two 
1774.62,"but probably not more than two spotlights, "
1777.56,and we can make those spotlights of perception 
1780.47,either very broad and diffuse or very narrow. 
1783.5,You can practice this now if you like. 
1785.03,"You can pick a spot on the wall away from you anywhere, "
1788.63,"or if you're driving, you can look at some location, "
1790.49,"and you can focus intensely on one small location, "
1794.15,"for instance, a tree in the horizon "
1796.04,or a person on the street 
1797.51,"or any number of different things outside of you, "
1800.78,or you can broaden that spotlight 
1802.34,to include the entire scene at once. 
1804.35,"You can also focus a spotlight of perception on your body, "
1807.74,say on the left upper portion of your chest. 
1812.15,And of course you can focus 
1813.74,on the left upper portion of your chest 
1815.51,"and something outside of you, "
1816.77,you can split your attention 
1818.03,between those two perceptual spotlights. 
1820.61,"It's very hard, although not impossible, "
1822.32,"to have three perceptual spotlights, "
1824.69,but most people can split to two points 
1827.51,of attention or perception pretty easily. 
1830.27,The other thing that most people can do pretty easily 
1832.7,is merge those two spotlights 
1835.16,"or, rather, to have just one spotlight of attention. "
1837.59,So you don't always have 
1838.43,"to have two spotlights of attention on, "
1840.14,"and here, I'm using the word attention "
1841.4,and perception interchangeably. 
1843.11,"But you could, for instance, have two points of attention, "
1846.02,so you're talking to somebody and you're paying attention 
1847.64,"to whether or not somebody's walking in the door or not, "
1850.01,"so that's two, "
1850.91,or you could be completely focused 
1852.38,"on the person you're talking to, "
1853.46,or you could be completely focused on the stomach ache 
1855.77,or the great sensation of hunger that you have in your belly 
1858.62,"while talking to somebody, "
1859.67,"in fact, you're not even listening "
1860.93,to what they're saying at all. 
1862.28,Okay? So you have two spotlights of perception. 
1864.47,You can split them or merge them into one. 
1867.56,"And, this is very important, "
1869.51,"those spotlights of perception can intensify or dim, "
1873.05,"and there, I'm using analogy. "
1874.73,What I mean by that is your perception of what's happening 
1877.7,"within those spotlights can be very, very high acuity. "
1881.93,"That is, you can register very fine changes in detail "
1885.11,like tingling on one side of your big toe of your right foot 
1888.41,"versus the other, "
1889.46,or it can be somewhat more diffuse. 
1891.17,"You're just thinking about your whole toe, "
1892.67,"which, in that case, seems like a small area, "
1894.5,"but the point is that you can consciously adjust the acuity, "
1898.82,"that is, the fineness of your perception. "
1901.82,All of this is under your power 
1903.62,because of the incredible ability of a brain structure 
1906.47,"whose name you now understand and know, "
1908.99,"which is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, "
1911.87,although there are other areas of your brain 
1913.46,involved as well. 
1914.63,Your ability to direct your attention to specific things 
1918.17,in your environment or within your body 
1920.51,or to split those points of attention or merge them 
1923.66,or dial up the intensity 
1925.22,of how closely you're paying attention 
1927.38,to every little shift or ripple 
1929.6,and change in sensation there 
1931.94,"or to kind of dissociate, if you will, "
1934.79,"for lack of a better word, "
1935.87,"to disengage from that perception, "
1938.18,all of that is under control because of your ability 
1940.91,"to engage this area that we call the prefrontal cortex, "
1944.0,"and, in particular, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. "
1947.48,I'd like to take a quick break 
1948.86,"and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. "
1951.89,"Athletic Greens, now called AG"
"1,",
1954.38,is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink 
1956.72,that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. 
1959.63,I've been taking Athletic Greens since 
"2012,",
1962.33,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
1964.55,The reason I started taking Athletic Greens 
1966.14,and the reason I still take Athletic Greens 
1968.21,once or usually twice a day 
1970.19,is that it gets me the probiotics 
1972.11,that I need for gut health. 
1973.79,Our gut is very important. 
1974.9,It's populated by gut microbiota 
1977.45,"that communicate with the brain, the immune system, "
1979.22,and basically all the biological systems of our body 
1981.59,"to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health, "
1985.25,and those probiotics in Athletic Greens 
1987.11,are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. 
1990.92,"In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number "
1992.78,"of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure "
1994.91,"that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, "
1997.85,and it tastes great. 
1999.74,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
2001.21,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
2004.6,and they'll give you five free travel packs 
2006.58,that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
2008.86,"while you're on the road, in the car, "
2010.18,"on the plane, et cetera, "
2011.47,and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
2014.89,"Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman "
2017.56,to get the five free travel packs 
2018.94,and the year's supply of vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
2021.94,"Okay, so now if we look at the example of what happens "
2024.61,when you sit or lie down and close your eyes 
2027.46,"and decide to meditate, "
2029.2,you should immediately realize 
2030.76,that that's a tremendous shift 
2033.28,"in your perceptual ability, why? "
2036.01,"Because that spotlight of attention, "
2038.2,while it can be oriented 
2040.15,"toward, for instance, what you hear in the room "
2042.76,or maybe the feeling of wind moving trees 
2046.12,"in the environment that you happen to be in, "
2048.01,"when we close our eyes, "
2049.6,"we shut down one of the major avenues for sensory input, "
2053.44,which is vision. 
2055.3,"And when we do that, "
2056.74,there's a tendency for those perceptual spotlights 
2059.8,to be focused more so on what happens 
2063.19,at the level of the surface of our skin 
2065.89,and inside of our bodies. 
2068.5,"And that informs us about something very important, "
2071.59,which is that there are actually two axes 
2073.93,or two ends of a continuum of perception. 
2076.9,"Up until now, I've been talking about perception "
2078.49,"and intention as kind of the same thing, "
2080.11,"and indeed they are, at least for sake of this conversation, "
2083.23,but within that word perception 
2085.42,"or within that word attention, there's a continuum, "
2088.75,and that continuum has on one end 
2091.54,something called interoception. 
2093.76,"Interoception, spelled with an I, "
2096.76,is everything that we sense 
2098.11,"at the level of our skin and inward, "
2100.66,"so the sensation inside our stomach, "
2102.31,the sensation of our heart beating. 
2103.99,Some people can sense their heart beating pretty easily. 
2106.06,Other people have more challenge doing that. 
2109.63,"What we are feeling on the surface of our skin, "
2111.73,"how hot or cold we feel, that's interoception. "
2116.05,"In contrast, at the other end of the continuum "
2118.48,"is so-called exteroception, spelled with an E. "
2121.72,Exteroception is perception of everything 
2124.81,that's outside or beyond the confines of our skin. 
2128.83,"So by shutting our eyes, "
2130.54,"and in particular, in a meditative practice "
2133.06,where we direct our attention 
2134.74,"toward our so-called third eye center, "
2136.48,"this area right behind our forehead, "
2138.01,"which, not so incidentally, is the prefrontal cortex, "
2141.55,"or in some cases where people will focus on their breathing, "
2144.64,so the movement of their stomach 
2146.11,or the movement of their diaphragm 
2147.46,or the lifting of their chest 
2148.78,or the extension of their belly while they breathe. 
2151.06,"By doing that, "
2152.62,we are taking what ordinarily is a perceptual state 
2156.82,"that's split between the outside world, exteroception, "
2161.23,and usually also toward our inner state. 
2163.81,"You know, most people are generally in touch "
2165.58,with how they are feeling from the skin inward 
2167.95,while they are also paying attention 
2169.6,to what's outside of them. 
2171.04,"You can think about somebody, "
2171.873,"for instance, at a restaurant or a sandwich shop "
2174.1,"about to order a sandwich and you're reading the menu, "
2175.99,"so that's exteroception, right? "
2177.4,The menu is outside the confines of your skin. 
2179.62,And little ideas or maybe big ideas come to mind 
2182.95,about what the roast beef sandwich 
2184.33,"or the vegetarian sandwich will taste like, "
2186.73,"what it will do for you, "
2188.29,"what's in it, what you like, what you don't like, et cetera. "
2191.11,That's splitting interoception and exteroception. 
2194.62,"But when we close our eyes, we stop, we slow down, "
2197.14,"we focus on our breathing or that third eye center, "
2200.32,the majority of our perception then shifts to interoception. 
2204.13,And when we shift down 
2205.87,"to that end of the continuum of interoception, "
2208.9,something very important happens. 
2210.97,"What happens is that those two regions, "
2213.94,"the ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the insula, "
2217.45,"really ramp up their levels of neural activity, "
2220.45,and that should make perfect sense to you 
2221.92,because those are areas of your brain that are registering 
2225.28,and paying attention to the various sensations 
2227.74,"of how full or empty your stomach feels, "
2230.98,"whether or not the surface of your skin feels hot or cold, "
2233.68,and on and on. 
2234.76,"So by just sitting down or lying down and closing your eyes, "
2237.82,your brain undergoes a massive shift 
2239.95,from exteroception to interoception. 
2242.59,"Now, that's not to say you can't be distracted "
2244.33,"by external events, and, in fact, many people are, "
2246.64,but the early stages of transitioning 
2248.44,into a meditative state 
2250.15,"involve this shift down the continuum, "
2253.15,"or, I should say, to one end of the continuum "
2254.92,"because there's no down-up, there's just the continuum, "
2258.1,shift along the continuum 
2259.66,to heightened levels of interoception. 
2262.42,"Now, I mentioned this briefly before, "
2263.98,but many people are very interoceptively aware 
2269.5,"just naturally, even if they don't do a meditation practice. "
2272.44,Other people are not. 
2274.0,And there's a pretty good measure 
2276.04,of whether or not you have high levels 
2277.69,"of interoceptive awareness or capability, "
2280.09,and that is your ability to count your heartbeats 
2282.46,without placing your fingers anywhere with any pressure 
2285.55,to take your pulse. 
2287.38,"You can do this if you like, "
2288.52,you can actually try and estimate your number of heartbeats 
2291.13,simply by trying to feel your heart beat. 
2293.32,"Some people are very good, "
2294.76,"meaning they're very accurate at doing this, "
2296.68,other people are not. 
2297.91,It does seem to be an ability 
2299.68,"that can be trained up quite a bit, "
2301.63,"and, in fact, meditative practices "
2303.1,"will improve your interoceptive awareness, "
2305.53,"but, and this is a very important point, "
2309.58,"heightened levels of interoceptive awareness, "
2311.71,"while that might sound attractive, "
2313.69,"oh, to be really in touch with your body, "
2316.84,"that is not always beneficial, why? "
2320.05,"Because many people who, for instance, "
2321.79,have excessive levels of anxiety 
2324.67,have excessive levels of anxiety 
2326.77,because they are very keenly aware 
2329.17,of any subtle shift in their heart rate or breathing 
2332.05,or change in the sensations within their stomach. 
2335.26,Whereas other people who are less aware 
2337.06,"of their bodily state, that can be beneficial, right? "
2340.03,"It can be adaptive or not, depending on the circumstances. "
2343.0,It's probably not adaptive 
2344.98,"to be very, very aware of your internal state "
2348.28,"if, for instance, you're doing public speaking, "
2349.96,you don't want to be thinking 
2350.793,about what's going on in your stomach 
2351.73,or how quickly you're breathing. 
2352.96,"I'm certainly trying to ignore all those signals, "
2355.6,those sensations now. 
2357.34,"But for somebody who has no awareness of what's going on, "
2360.73,"very little interoceptive awareness, "
2363.04,"that can be problematic, too, "
2364.9,because these are the very people 
2366.55,who can ignore the fact that they're having a heart attack 
2368.5,or can ignore the fact that they have high blood pressure 
2371.41,and are carrying about life focused on everything external 
2374.23,with no awareness of their own body. 
2375.91,"They're, quote, unquote, out of touch with their body. "
2378.73,"So we want to be very careful about placing valence, "
2382.99,which is a sort of value of good or bad 
2385.27,on interoceptive awareness versus exteroceptive awareness. 
2388.27,"More importantly, we want to emphasize "
2389.89,"that when you undergo a meditation practice, "
2392.65,if it's of the sort where you stop your movement 
2394.93,"and close your eyes, "
2396.34,you are training for interoceptive awareness. 
2399.37,This becomes important later when we get into discussions 
2402.73,about meditation for reducing anxiety. 
2406.06,"Some people may opt, "
2408.43,"in fact, I would say some people ought to opt "
2410.74,for a meditative practice 
2411.88,"which involves more exteroceptive awareness, "
2414.82,actually a meditation like a walking meditation 
2417.1,or even a seated meditation 
2418.57,where they are bringing their focus 
2420.04,to a place outside their body 
2422.68,as opposed to inside their body. 
2424.51,"And in fact, there are examples of people "
2426.73,who have meditated quite a lot 
2428.41,who develop such a heightened state or awareness 
2431.14,"of their interoceptive components, "
2433.48,"that is, just fancy, again, nerd speak "
2435.43,for so aware of their breathing and of their heart 
2438.4,and of the state of their gut 
2440.23,that it actually is intrusive for daily activities. 
2443.2,So I will ask you to ask this question of yourself now. 
2447.28,Are you somebody who tends to be very in touch 
2450.13,"with your bodily sensations, "
2451.93,"so, for instance, from the skin inwards? "
2454.42,Or are you somebody who tends to be less in touch with 
2457.15,or aware of your interoceptive state? 
2460.36,There is no right or wrong answer. 
2461.86,You don't get an A or an F or a D or a C 
2463.87,depending on your answer. 
2464.89,It's just a good question 
2466.42,"for each and every one of us to answer, "
2468.13,and I think most people will answer that it depends. 
2471.28,It depends on whether or not you are in a social setting 
2473.68,or whether or not you're alone. 
2475.09,But we are going to return to that answer so keep it in mind 
2478.24,because it will become very beneficial 
2480.31,in building an optimal meditation practice for you. 
2483.7,"But for now, just note, "
2484.78,"there's this continuum of perception, "
2486.601,interoception and exteroception. 
2488.23,Closing your eyes increases interoception. 
2490.18,Opening your eyes dramatically increases exteroception 
2493.51,"just automatically, "
2494.95,"just automatically because so much of your brain, "
2496.84,"in fact, "
40%,"or more, is dedicated to vision. "
2499.39,"And this, I should say, for those of you "
2500.98,that are low vision or no vision 
2502.39,"and those of you that are blind or have poor vision, "
2505.03,"this entire process is translated to the auditory, "
2508.78,"to the sound domain, "
2510.88,so it's true for people that can see 
2512.98,and it's true for people that can't see. 
2514.9,"Of course, people that can't see, closing the eyes "
2516.64,"doesn't have this huge shift towards interoception, "
2519.49,"but there have been a few studies, "
2521.56,"not as many as I would've liked to find, "
2523.12,"but a few studies of, for instance, people who are blind "
2526.48,"or have low vision, don't see very well, "
2528.28,and when they close their ears 
2530.17,and they can't hear the external world 
2532.06,"or they put headphones on or noise-canceling headphones, "
2534.49,then the world inside of them becomes very prominent 
2537.94,relative to the world outside of them for obvious reasons. 
2540.67,So I asked you to ask yourself 
2542.08,whether or not you are somebody 
2543.22,"who tends to be more interoceptively aware or not, "
2546.73,more exteroceptively aware or not. 
2549.58,"And some of you might not be able to answer that question, "
2551.8,"and if you can't, chances are "
2553.99,that you are effectively sliding along that continuum 
2556.75,depending on the activities that you're doing. 
2558.91,So you're probably the kind of person 
2560.5,where if somebody comes over to you 
2561.85,"and starts talking to you, "
2562.683,"you will engage in that conversation, "
2564.64,and you don't feel so inside your body 
2567.22,that you're thinking about your heart beating 
2568.96,"and whether or not you're flushing red, et cetera, "
2570.61,you're going to pay attention to what they say. 
2572.35,"Many people, however, when somebody talks to them, "
2575.62,if they have social anxiety 
2577.3,"or even a slight bit of social anxiety, "
2579.64,will be thinking about whether or not 
2581.56,their cheeks are flushing 
2582.52,or whether or not they look right or sound right 
2584.92,or whether or not they have something in their teeth. 
2586.51,"These are normal responses, "
2588.31,but they really speak to this issue 
2590.29,of whether or not you tend to shift 
2591.91,more towards interoceptive awareness 
2593.53,or exteroceptive awareness. 
2594.79,"And, of course, it's context dependent. "
2596.41,It will depend on whether or not 
2597.52,"you're, you know, out on a date with somebody "
2599.2,"that, you know, you would loathe to find out later "
2601.84,that you had food in your teeth 
2603.76,or whether or not you're with somebody 
2604.81,you're more familiar with 
2605.68,where that would not really matter much 
2607.57,or the other person would tell you this kind of thing. 
2609.91,What does it mean to be at one location or another location 
2613.63,along this continuum of interoception or exteroception? 
2617.08,"Well, we know what it means neurally, right? "
2619.33,"We know that if you are more interoceptively aware, "
2622.48,"your insula and ACC are active, but that's not very useful. "
2625.15,That's not helpful as a tool. That's just a fact. 
2628.0,"Now, there have actually been studies "
2630.13,of what a meditation practice can do 
2632.95,in terms of moving you along this continuum 
2636.01,from where you naturally sit 
2638.65,in order to help you function 
2640.51,not just during the meditation but at all times. 
2643.6,"And in order to illustrate this, "
2645.61,I want to start with a description 
2646.72,of what is now a classic study. 
2649.06,"It's a very cool study, it has a very cool name. "
2651.61,It talks about something very important 
2653.65,"that will come up again and again in today's conversation, "
2655.447,and that's something called the default mode network. 
2658.42,The default mode network 
2659.44,is a collection of different brain areas 
2661.39,that essentially are active 
2662.59,when we're not doing much of anything 
2664.57,and certainly is active when we are not focused 
2668.2,on one particular task or conversation or activity. 
2671.71,The default mode network can be thought of more or less 
2675.01,as the network that generates mind wandering 
2678.25,or our thoughts drifting from the past 
2680.31,to the present to the future. 
2681.79,"Remember, earlier, I talked about "
2683.05,how your perceptual spotlight 
2684.97,can either be two spotlights or they can merge. 
2687.79,"Well, similarly, human beings "
2689.83,"can think about the past, surely, "
2691.63,"the present, definitely, and the future. "
2695.2,And it turns out we can also split our thoughts 
2698.41,just like we can split our perception 
2700.45,"into two of those three things, "
2702.67,"so I can think about the past, a past event, "
2705.31,and I can think about the present. 
2706.54,I can split my thinking and my memory in that way. 
2709.27,I can also think about the present and the future. 
2711.16,"I can also think about the future and the past, "
2714.19,"although it's very difficult, although not impossible, "
2717.73,to split one's thinking and memory 
2719.98,"into the past, the present, and future simultaneously, "
2722.62,"not easily done, "
2723.88,but pretty easy to split one's attention and thinking 
2727.36,"into two of those three things, "
2728.92,"either the past, the present, and the future "
2731.35,"or any two of those three things, okay? "
2734.14,"Just like with attentional spotlighting, "
2735.91,"you can place your mind, your thinking, and your memory, "
2738.79,your cognition onto one of those things 
2741.64,"and be very, very present "
2743.26,or the past and the present and so on and so forth. 
2746.32,"The default mode network, "
2748.54,"while it involves a lot of different brain areas, "
2750.61,can be thought of simply as the network of brain areas 
2754.78,that are active when your mind is wandering 
2757.48,between these different time domains. 
2759.22,"And the paper I'd like to share with you, "
2760.78,"as I mentioned before, is now a classic paper, "
2762.58,"it has a wonderful title, "
2764.8,which is A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind. 
2768.22,"Now, that sounds almost like a news article "
2769.96,"or a news article about a scientific paper, "
2772.6,but that's actually the title of the scientific paper 
2774.82,"which was published in the journal, ""Science,"" "
2776.95,which is one of the three apex journals. 
2779.08,"You know, scientific publishing is competitive, "
2781.21,but it's especially competitive 
2782.95,"to get manuscripts accepted into ""Science,"" into ""Nature,"" "
2786.88,"and into the journal ""Cell,"" "
2788.05,"so it represents kind of the Super Bowl, NBA Championships, "
2792.31,"and Stanley Cup, if you will, "
2794.047,for you sports aficionados of scientific publishing. 
2796.69,This is a paper from Matthew Killingsworth and Dan Gilbert. 
2799.6,It was published in 
"2010,",
2801.61,but it's still considered a classic. 
2803.11,"And this paper, A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind, "
2805.72,has a number of very important points. 
2807.16,I'm going to paraphrase certain elements of it for you 
2809.68,because they say essentially what I would like you to know 
2812.26,far better than I could say. 
2814.96,"So first of all, they started out with a statement, "
2817.45,"which I confess I disagree with, "
2819.73,"which is, ""Unlike other animals, "
2821.56,human beings spend a lot of time 
2823.12,thinking about what is not going on around them: 
2825.67,"contemplating events that happened in the past, "
2827.77,"might happen in the future, or will never happen at all."" "
2830.83,I agree with their assertion that human beings do that. 
2833.71,"That's certainly my experience, "
2835.3,"although I must say, "
2836.53,I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever 
2838.96,that other animals don't do it also. 
2841.57,"So my apologies, Killingsworth and Gilbert, "
2843.88,but I'd be happy to go toe-to-toe with you on that. 
2845.62,I am not aware of any data that prove one way or the other 
2849.19,what other animals are thinking. 
2851.92,"So let's set aside other animals, "
2854.02,and let's focus on the human animal. 
2856.48,"Now, their point is still a very good one, "
2859.06,which is that humans have this wandering of the mind 
2862.45,that they call stimulus-independent thought. 
2864.43,"That is, there's nothing happening to create these thoughts "
2867.25,or anything happening in the immediate environment. 
2869.74,These thoughts are just happening on their own internally. 
2872.44,That's the default mode network. 
2874.9,This study was important. 
2876.28,"In fact, it was a landmark study "
2877.57,because they did it right about the time 
2879.31,"that smartphones became widely available and in use, "
2883.33,"so again, "
2010.,
2884.62,"So they basically pinged people, "
2886.78,"they contacted people on their iPhones many times per day, "
2891.91,and they did this for well over 
"2,",
200,adults. 
2896.02,They had a mix of male and female people in this study. 
2899.83,The mean age was 
34,"years, but there was a range, "
2902.05,"mean, of course, being average, "
2903.67,but there were a range of different ages and so forth. 
2906.61,"And at any moment, they asked people, "
2908.147,"""What are you feeling right now?"" "
2909.94,"And they also asked them, ""What are you doing right now?"" "
2912.58,So they were looking for the match or mismatch 
2914.65,between what people were doing and what they were feeling. 
2916.75,They were essentially trying to probe 
2918.19,"what people were thinking about, "
2919.75,and they also addressed that. 
2921.37,"And they came up with a kind of a bubble chart, if you will, "
2925.6,"where the bigger the bubble, "
2927.37,"the more answers came back about one particular thing, "
2930.46,and they assessed whether or not 
2931.81,"people were happy or not in that moment, or sad or not, "
2934.33,whether or not they were focused 
2935.26,on what they were doing or not. 
2936.7,"There are a lot of bubbles in this chart, "
2938.08,so I'm not going to read them all. 
2939.46,"But the important points that came from the data, "
2942.34,"and, again, this is a very large data set, "
2944.26,"was that, and here again, I'm paraphrasing, "
2946.15,"first, people's minds wandered frequently "
2948.22,regardless of what they were doing. 
2950.98,"In nearly half of the samples taken, "
2954.37,"people were generally thinking about something else, "
2956.71,"except, it turns out, "
2957.94,there's this one little bubble 
2958.93,"sitting way far out on the horizon here, "
2961.57,"people claimed, and I'm inclined to believe them, "
2964.81,that they tend to be very focused on making love 
2968.2,if they were making love in the moment 
2969.88,where they were pinged on their iPhone. 
2971.08,"Now, why their iPhone was there with them at that moment, "
2973.51,I don't know. 
2974.343,That wasn't included in this description of the study. 
2977.41,"But all the other activities, grooming and self-care, "
2979.87,"listening to the news, watching television, "
2983.26,"relaxing, working, et cetera, et cetera, "
2986.41,"during all those activities, "
2987.73,people claimed that their mind wandered a lot. 
2989.92,"And then they also assessed, of course, their mood "
2992.38,and how those people felt at any given moment 
2995.95,depending on what they were doing 
2997.18,and how well their mind and their emotions 
3000.93,matched what they were doing. 
3002.34,"And what they say here is second, "
3005.1,they revealed that people were less happy 
3006.9,"when their minds were wandering than when they were not, "
3009.33,and this was true during all activities. 
3012.48,"And then third, what people were thinking at a given moment "
3016.98,was far better a predictor of their happiness 
3020.49,than what they were doing. 
3021.9,So this is interesting 
3022.95,and I think matches a lot of people's experience. 
3025.5,"In fact, I think as you hear about this study, "
3027.48,"many of you will probably just say, ""Well, duh."" "
3029.88,"I mean, if you're working and you don't like your work "
3031.393,"and you're thinking about something bad that happened, "
3034.23,"well, then of course you're not going to be happy. "
3037.08,But the key point of this study 
3038.52,is that it did not necessarily have to be the case 
3042.69,that people were thinking about something unpleasant. 
3044.94,"In fact, if people were working "
3047.76,and they were thinking about something else 
3049.5,"that was pleasant, that also made them feel unhappy. "
3053.73,"In other words, the mismatch between being in an activity "
3057.33,and having our mind elsewhere 
3059.52,led people to report themselves 
3061.53,as feeling more unhappy in that moment. 
3063.69,"And when you total this up, what you find is that people "
3065.97,"are often not present to what they are doing, "
3068.67,"and that is a great source of unhappiness, "
3070.8,"even if their thoughts are those of happy, joyful thoughts. "
3076.08,So this is interesting 
3076.98,and I think runs counter to what most of us have heard 
3080.61,"or have been taught, "
3081.443,"which is, you know, think good thoughts, "
3083.13,"you know, try and suppress bad thoughts, "
3084.72,"have a good internal landscape, "
3086.67,"you know, create a good narrative. "
3088.26,"That is all true, but equally if not more important "
3093.21,is to have the ability to be fully engaged 
3096.12,in what you are doing at a given moment. 
3098.04,That is the strongest predictor of being happy. 
3101.01,And there were several other studies 
3102.6,"that followed up on this, "
3103.59,but their conclusion that they put 
3104.73,in the final short paragraph of this paper 
3106.41,I think really captures it beautifully. 
3108.18,"They say, and here, I'm quoting directly, "
3109.537,"""In conclusion, a human mind is a wandering mind, "
3112.92,and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind. 
3115.65,The ability to think about what is not happening 
3118.23,"in a moment,"" I added the in a moment part, "
3120.547,"""is a cognitive achievement "
3122.94,"that comes at an emotional cost."" "
3124.92,"So I know I'm not alone in believing that this paper, "
3127.95,"A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind, "
3129.42,and we will provide a link to this paper 
3130.89,"in the show note captions, "
3132.18,is absolutely key in understanding 
3134.82,why a meditation practice is so important 
3137.13,because a meditation practice 
3139.41,is really about adjusting your place 
3141.99,along that interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum 
3146.22,to what you happen to be experiencing in that moment. 
3150.66,And while most people think of a meditative practice 
3152.82,as focusing on what's going on internally 
3155.52,"with your eyes closed, third eye center, "
3157.11,"focusing on your breathing, et cetera, "
3158.58,"for any number of minutes or maybe even an hour or longer, "
3162.57,there are other forms of meditation 
3164.22,in which your exteroception dominates 
3166.5,and which you are actively focusing on things outside 
3170.4,"or beyond the confines of your skin and internal landscape, "
3174.09,"and that, too, is meditation. "
3177.21,"And if we are to take the work of Killingsworth and Gilbert, "
3180.78,"this A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind, seriously, "
3183.9,and I know a number of other laboratories have 
3185.91,and have supported this research with their findings 
3188.34,"again and again and again, "
3189.87,what this means is that meditating 
3192.69,is not necessarily a practice that we do 
3194.67,divorced from the rest of life. 
3197.22,"Meditation and mindfulness in particular, "
3199.29,being present to what we are doing in a given moment 
3202.98,is one of the essential keys to happiness and improved mood 
3207.45,even if what we are doing is unpleasant. 
3210.36,"So that brings us to a tool, "
3211.83,and it's a tool that any and all of us can use 
3213.9,"whether or not you tend to be interoceptively dominant, "
3216.9,"right, that you tend to pay more attention "
3218.64,"to your bodily sensations, or exteroceptively dominant. "
3222.15,"And, again, if you don't know the answer to that question, "
3224.46,there's a simple test that you can do. 
3226.2,"You can just sit down or lie down, close your eyes, "
3229.41,and you can ask yourself or assess 
3233.01,whether or not your attention tends to fleet 
3235.89,"to things outside of you, right, "
3238.86,"cars honking or going by, people in the room, "
3242.16,or whether or not you tend to be able to focus 
3243.96,on your internal landscape 
3245.19,to the exclusion of exteroception and attention to things 
3247.74,outside the confines of your skin easily. 
3250.14,"Now, of course, this will depend on context and situation, "
3252.81,"even how well rested you are, et cetera, "
3254.85,but that's exactly the point. 
3256.59,This is the sort of thing you want to do 
3259.23,every time you decide to do a meditation practice. 
3262.44,"In fact, I would suggest that you use this "
3266.34,to determine what meditation you do at any given moment. 
3270.15,So let's say you are somebody who is a regular meditator 
3272.64,or let's say you're somebody who's never meditated 
3274.65,and you'd like to develop a meditation practice. 
3277.26,I suggest that you do a test 
3280.38,of whether or not you are more interoceptively dominant 
3282.96,or exteroceptively dominant in that moment. 
3286.38,"Again, this is not a personality trait. "
3288.51,This is a question about where you happen to be in a moment. 
3291.3,So let's say you're on a plane or you're in the car. 
3293.76,"If you're in the car, "
3294.593,"please don't close your eyes while driving, "
3295.56,"that's sort of obvious, but do this in a safe way, please. "
3299.52,"But stop, close your eyes, "
3302.61,and assess whether or not you can access 
3305.7,and focus your attention primarily on your internal state 
3309.75,or whether or not your attention and perception 
3312.21,"gets pulled to something external, to exteroception. "
3315.93,"And, again, that will vary "
3317.91,depending on circumstance and who you are. 
3320.04,Then I suggest opening your eyes 
3322.11,and trying to focus your attention 
3323.91,to something external to you 
3326.07,and seeing or evaluating the extent 
3328.35,to which you can divorce your perception 
3331.26,from sensations that occur 
3333.15,at the level of your skin or internally. 
3335.7,"Now, I should say that there's no technology, "
3337.74,"at least not that I'm aware of, absence of fMRI machine, "
3341.82,"in which case, you are inside an fMRI machine "
3343.89,while you do this. 
3344.73,"But unless you are in that experiment, "
3346.47,"and most of us aren't, "
3348.33,"there's no technology that can tell you, for instance, "
3351.48,whether or not you are interoceptively dominant 
3353.52,or exteroceptively dominant 
3354.9,"and whether or not the ratio is, you know, "
75,to 
25,
3358.17,or what have you at any given moment. 
3359.91,You have to assess this subjectively. 
3362.04,"However, if you sit down, for instance, "
3364.59,and you notice that you can equally split your attention 
3366.63,between internal sensations and external sensations 
3369.81,or whether or not you find yourself 
3371.01,pulled into external sensations 
3372.51,when you're trying to focus inward 
3374.31,or you find yourself pulled inward 
3376.8,"when you're trying to focus outward, "
3378.24,"well, that will dictate the sort of meditation "
3380.22,that you perhaps ought to perform in that moment. 
3384.45,Let me give an example of how you would do this. 
3386.46,"You would stop in some way, "
3388.08,"so sit or lie down, close your eyes, "
3390.21,and evaluate whether or not you can essentially rule out 
3395.13,or eliminate attention to all outside events. 
3398.55,"Most people won't be able to do that entirely, "
3400.56,"but try and focus your attention, "
3401.76,"for instance, on your breathing "
3402.68,"or the typical third eye center, "
3404.1,"you know, focusing at a spot right behind your forehead. "
3406.47,If you feel you can do that reasonably well 
3408.24,"to the exclusion of what's happening around you, "
3410.64,"well, then an important question arises. "
3413.67,Should you meditate in a way 
3415.26,to enhance that interoceptive awareness? 
3417.72,"Or rather, should you meditate in a way, "
3420.06,"for instance, with your eyes open "
3421.62,and your attention on a particular portion 
3423.42,of the landscape you're in 
3424.47,"like a tree or maybe even, you know, an object or a plant "
3428.91,or something else in your immediate environment 
3430.95,to try and cultivate 
3432.36,or enhance your exteroceptive awareness? 
3434.82,"That's up to you, but my bias would be one "
3437.64,in which you work against your default state. 
3440.61,"Again, the default mode network is where you land "
3444.36,on this interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. 
3447.273,"It's going to lead to more mind wandering, "
3449.76,whereas when you encourage 
3451.92,or we could even say force yourself a little bit 
3454.2,to anchor your attention 
3455.82,"to either inside your body or outside your body, "
3459.36,and you make that decision 
3460.59,"according to what you are doing less easily, "
3464.73,"well, then you are actively training up the neural circuits. "
3468.69,"You are engaging so-called neuroplasticity, "
3470.7,the brain's ability to change in response to experience. 
3472.92,You are deliberately engaging a shift 
3477.15,along that continuum. 
3478.56,"To make this crystal clear, what I mean is this. "
3480.3,Let me give an example. 
3481.55,"If I were to sit down and I wanted to do some meditation, "
3485.04,let's just say three minutes of meditation. 
3486.63,There's good evidence that even three minutes of meditation 
3489.09,"can be beneficial for a variety of things, "
3490.95,including enhanced focus and enhanced anxiety management. 
3495.18,Let's say I sit down 
3496.02,and I notice that I can really focus inward 
3498.69,on what's happening at the level of my skin 
3501.15,"and my internal organs, and I can rule out everything. "
3504.99,Maybe that's 'cause the room is quiet 
3506.37,or maybe it's just because my brain is in a state 
3508.95,that I'm particularly good at that at that moment 
3511.92,or maybe it's just a natural ability. 
3513.93,Well then I would opt for a three-minute meditation practice 
3517.02,"in which I deliberately exterocept, "
3520.05,that I build up the circuitry 
3521.88,to focus on something external to me 
3524.4,"because I want, and I think most people would like, "
3527.22,to have an adaptive mechanism within them 
3530.4,so that they can slide along that continuum 
3532.47,and they don't default 
3534.15,to whatever happens to be easiest for them in that moment. 
3537.72,"Now, if I were to sit down "
3539.1,and try and focus on what's going on internally 
3541.11,and I kept getting distracted 
3542.28,"by things happening outside of me, "
3543.72,opening my eyes or feeling like I need to reach for my phone 
3546.27,"or paying attention to the sounds in the room, "
3548.31,"well, then I would actively engage a meditation practice, "
3550.97,"in this case, a three-minute example but it could be longer, "
3554.07,where I'm deliberately trying to focus my perception 
3557.79,on events at the level of the confines of my skin 
3560.58,and internally. 
3561.81,Why do I say this? 
3562.643,"Well, you know, I love to use the phrase anytime with kids, "
3566.7,"you know, when they say ""This is really hard "
3568.32,"or something's challenging,"" "
3569.34,"or adults will say, ""That's really tough."" "
3571.14,"Well, as my graduate advisor used to say, "
3573.69,that means you're learning. 
3575.1,"If something were easy, "
3576.27,"if you can perform any activity or thought, et cetera, "
3579.21,"well, then there is absolutely zero reason "
3581.64,for your neural circuits to change. 
3583.65,"It's the friction, it's the feeling that something is hard "
3586.38,that turns on the enormous variety of mechanisms 
3589.56,"at the level of cells, et cetera, "
3591.18,that allow you to potentially change your neural circuitry. 
3594.15,So challenge and discomfort 
3596.91,is the signal to your brain and body 
3599.37,"that something needs to change, "
3601.05,so I'm encouraging you to embark on meditative practices 
3605.19,"that are not your default, okay? "
3608.61,To essentially go against the grain 
3611.34,of where your interoceptive bias or your exteroceptive bias 
3615.03,happens to be at a given moment. 
3616.71,"And, again, this will change. "
3617.73,"For some of you, this will change across the day "
3620.01,"where early in the day, you are very, very good "
3623.28,"at doing an interoceptive-biased meditation, "
3626.19,"and later in the day, you aren't. "
3628.47,"I actually believe, based on the data that I've covered, "
3630.6,"and we'll get into a few more papers about this, "
3633.09,"and my lab is actively working on this as well, "
3635.61,"that a meditative practice can be made far more effective, "
3640.8,"that is, it can invoke more neuroplasticity, "
3644.1,more shift in brain states and brain circuitry 
3648.06,"if we do not take the easy path, "
3651.75,"that is, we go against the grain "
3654.78,of what our brain would naturally do in a given moment. 
3657.81,So if you're in a crowded airport 
3659.28,"and you're finding that everything's very distracting, "
3661.65,"well, then that would be a great time "
3664.2,to do some interoceptive focused meditation. 
3666.9,"Whereas if you are really in your head, "
3669.223,"you know, you're looping thoughts "
3670.14,"about the past and present, "
3671.22,"maybe you're even in obsessive thought, "
3673.14,"well, that would be a terrific time, an ideal time really, "
3676.44,to do a short meditation 
3678.69,focused on something external to you. 
3680.88,"In both cases, whether or not you're focused "
3682.83,"on interoceptive bias or exteroceptive bias, "
3687.03,"you are going against, or I should say you're pushing back "
3690.21,against your default mode network. 
3692.37,"I would argue it's going to be far more effective, "
3695.31,"that is, you're going to reduce or shift the activity "
3698.43,of that default mode network far more 
3700.44,and in a far more beneficial way 
3702.87,if you actively try and suppress your bias 
3706.2,toward being more interoceptive or exteroceptive. 
3708.78,"Now, I think that's immensely beneficial, "
3710.97,"both for the immediate changes that you experience, "
3713.37,"what others have called a state change, "
3715.83,"because that's what it is, "
3717.33,"and it also can lead to, as we referred to earlier, "
3720.87,"more neuroplasticity, more changes in the brain circuits "
3723.96,that underlie your default mode network 
3726.45,and lead to what are called trait changes. 
3728.4,And I want to be very clear that I am not the first 
3731.13,to make this state versus trait distinction. 
3733.86,That's a distinction that was raised 
3735.66,in a really wonderful book. 
3737.16,"In fact, I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
3739.17,"The book is ""Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation "
3742.23,"Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body."" "
3744.99,This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson 
3748.02,who've done terrific work and many writings 
3750.24,"and many TED Talks, et cetera, about meditation. "
3752.64,I would say that circa 
"2016,",
"2017,",
3756.39,this book really captured 
3758.46,what I believe to be the most essential elements 
3761.25,of the science of meditation 
3762.48,and a lot of the history of it as well. 
3764.64,"Today, we are focusing "
3765.69,on much of what's covered in this book 
3767.25,but also a lot of things 
3768.083,"that have happened, excuse me, since "
2017.,
3770.85,"In fact, most of the papers that I'm going to talk about "
3772.95,are papers that were published after 
2017.,
3775.503,"But, again, this is a wonderful book "
3776.94,where they very clearly distinguish 
3779.04,"between state changes and trait changes, "
3781.14,trait changes being the more long-lasting ones. 
3783.87,My read of this book and the literature that follows 
3787.35,"is, again, that when you sit down to meditate, "
3791.1,it is going to be most effective 
3793.23,"to do that interoceptive, exteroceptive bias assessment. "
3796.77,Ask yourself whether or not you are more in your head 
3799.17,"or outside your head, if you will, "
3801.3,and then to do a meditation practice 
3803.31,"that runs counter to where you happen to be at, "
3807.06,"that is, that pushes you more externally "
3809.34,"if you're in your head, "
3810.54,"and if you're more focused on what's going on around you, "
3813.09,that pushes you more internally. 
3815.07,"Now, I think most people are familiar "
3816.48,with how to do an interoceptive-biased meditation. 
3819.27,"Again, that would be setting a timer. "
3820.62,"Maybe you don't have even set a timer, "
3821.94,"you just sit or lie down, close your eyes, "
3823.35,focus on that third eye center behind your forehead 
3826.17,or focus on your breathing or your bodily sensations. 
3828.96,That's typical and often discussed. 
3830.58,"Exteroceptive based meditations, "
3833.64,you pick a focal point outside 
3836.88,"or beyond the confines of your skin, "
3838.65,"so that could be, for instance, a point on the wall "
3841.05,"if you are indoors, it could be a plant, "
3843.48,it could be a point on the horizon far away. 
3846.39,What you will find is that your visual system 
3849.27,will fatigue a little bit 
3850.32,when you concentrate your visual focus at that location. 
3852.75,I want to remind you that it is perfectly okay 
3855.09,"and, in fact, necessary to blink, "
3857.13,"so you should blink, you can relax your face, "
3858.87,you can change your expression. 
3860.01,There is no rule that says that you can't do those things. 
3862.65,"This is not, you know, just beaming a particular location "
3865.71,in space and holding your eyelids open. 
3867.63,I've been accused many times of not blinking very often. 
3870.12,That's for other reasons. 
3871.02,It's part of the way I access memory 
3873.18,about what I want to say. 
3874.2,"I don't use a prompter here, "
3875.49,so I'm accessing from a sort of internal image in my head. 
3880.23,That's how my memory works. 
3881.4,"But in any case, "
3882.63,"if you're going to do an exteroceptive-biased meditation, "
3885.84,there is absolutely no reason 
3887.22,why you wouldn't look away from that location 
3889.41,every once in a while 
3890.25,in the same way 
3891.45,that if you were focused on internal thoughts 
3893.4,"with your eyes closed and focused on your breathing, "
3895.47,"every once in a while, "
3896.55,your thoughts will skip away from that breathing 
3900.57,or from your third eye center. 
3901.68,"In fact, and this is discussed in the book ""Altered Traits"" "
3905.19,"but by many other people as well, "
3907.59,"one of the key elements of any meditative practice, "
3910.14,whether or not it's interoceptively focused 
3912.3,"or exteroceptively focused, "
3914.25,is that it's really a refocusing practice. 
3917.64,The more number of times that you have to yank yourself back 
3921.27,into attending or perceiving one specific thing. 
3924.12,"In other words, the more times your mind wanders "
3926.16,"and you bring it back, "
3927.54,actually the more effective that practice is. 
3929.88,"Again, if you can just focus on one location "
3932.13,with laser precision 
3933.12,and your mind never darts away from that 
3934.86,"and you don't have to bring it back, "
3935.76,"well, then there's no neuroplasticity, "
3937.5,nothing needs to change because your nervous system 
3940.14,will effectively know it's performing perfectly. 
3942.33,So if you're somebody who tries to do meditation 
3943.857,"and you find that your mind just wanders, "
3945.6,just remember every time you scruff yourself 
3947.73,and pull yourself back 
3948.66,to focusing on some location externally 
3950.88,"or focus back on your breath or your third eye center, "
3953.46,"each one of those aren't just opportunities to do better, "
3956.79,they are essential to the improvement process. 
3960.3,Think about them as ascending a staircase of refocusing. 
3963.48,"Every time you refocus, you're going up one more level, "
3966.54,"another stair, another stair, another stair, "
3968.97,and I think that will move you away 
3971.01,from the kind of judgmental process 
3972.96,"of thinking, ""Ugh, like, I can't focus on anything."" "
3974.91,"Pretty soon, what you'll notice "
3976.47,is that the refocusing process will happen so quickly 
3980.55,that you don't even perceive it. 
3982.17,"And, again, this is something that's borne out "
3983.94,in the neuroimaging data. 
3984.93,A lot of people think that they can focus 
3987.66,"with laser precision, "
3988.98,"but actually, what they are better at doing "
3990.63,is refocusing more quickly and consistently over time. 
3994.08,There's a classic study about this 
3996.0,in very experienced meditators that was done in Japan 
3998.34,where they had people 
3999.96,"with varying levels of meditation ability, "
4002.45,"so some who had never meditated, "
4004.31,others who were really expert meditators 
4006.08,with many hundreds if not thousands of hours 
4008.33,"of meditation under their belt, "
4009.65,and they had those people listen to 
20,tones 
4012.89,"repeated over and over, the same tone, "
4014.87,and they found that the expert meditators 
4016.91,"could really focus, and they did this by brain imaging, "
4020.18,they could really focus on all 
20,"tones, "
4022.46,whereas most people kind of attenuate 
4024.29,or what's called habituate to the tone 
4025.79,so that by the 
10th,or 
11th,"tone, "
4027.08,their mind is really going to something else. 
4029.54,"Now, that's wonderful, but that really just tells us "
4032.45,the expert meditators have better focus. 
4034.34,But it turns out that the more modern neuroimaging studies 
4038.03,have shown that they don't have better focus 
4039.62,such that they're staying in a very narrow trench of focus. 
4042.44,What they're doing is they're exiting focus 
4044.15,"and going back in more quickly, more quickly, more quickly "
4046.31,over and over again. 
4047.51,"So rather than think about your ability to focus, "
4050.09,"think about your ability to refocus, "
4052.1,"and the more number of times you have to refocus, "
4054.2,the better training you're getting. 
4055.76,"So earlier, I mentioned doing this interoceptive-biased "
4058.16,or exteroceptive-biased meditation for three minutes. 
4061.46,Why did I say three minutes? 
4062.54,"Well, three minutes seems like a reasonable number "
4064.25,"for most people to do consistently, you know, once a day. "
4068.24,"And in fact, there are some studies "
4069.76,of one-minute meditations and three-minute meditations 
4071.917,and 
10,and 
60.,
4073.7,My laboratory has been studying a 
5-minute-a-day,"meditation, "
4076.79,"and that clearly has benefits, "
4078.71,"but I think it's also clear that by three minutes, "
4082.94,many of the benefits are starting to arrive. 
4085.16,And so while I'm not pointing 
4086.96,"at any one particular data point here, "
4089.45,it's very clear that forcing oneself 
4093.02,"to direct one's perception, that is, your attention, "
4097.25,to your internal state or to something external to you 
4100.91,is immensely beneficial if you do it consistently 
4103.25,"and is, again, especially beneficial "
4105.59,if you're focusing your attention 
4107.69,"on the portion of your experience, "
4110.57,"either internal or external to you, "
4112.46,that is not the one 
4113.81,that you would default to in that moment. 
4116.12,And some people have taken this to the extreme to say 
4118.22,"that, you know, you can even just move about your day, "
4120.29,"and then every once in a while, "
4121.28,just do a one breath meditation. 
4123.41,"To be honest, when I look at the whole of the data, "
4126.11,it seems as if it doesn't really matter 
4129.77,in order to derive most of the benefits 
4131.81,of a meditation practice. 
4133.22,"Now, I'm a big fan of some of the newer meditation apps "
4136.31,that are out there. 
4137.143,One in particular that I've been using 
4138.557,and that actually I started using 
4140.21,because my dad is a big fan of it 
4142.04,and he does now fairly long meditations. 
4144.23,He's doing about 
10,or 
20,minutes 
4146.24,"at least every other day and often every day, "
4148.22,and he convinced me to check out the Waking Up app 
4150.89,that Sam Harris has put out. 
4153.56,"I looked at it, I think some of it sits behind a paywall, "
4157.04,but you can access much of it or at least do a trial 
4160.49,and try it out without having to get behind that paywall. 
4163.01,"They're not a sponsor of this podcast, I should mention, "
4165.29,but I decided to use the Waking Up app. 
4167.06,"I think it's terrific, "
4168.14,and I think one of the reasons it's terrific 
4169.97,is that Sam includes short descriptions 
4172.19,of what meditation is doing 
4173.777,and what a specific meditation can do for you 
4176.6,just prior to doing that meditation. 
4178.73,So those meditations can be quite brief. 
4180.41,"Some of them are a minute long, two minutes long, "
4182.3,some are longer or even quite a bit longer. 
4185.15,"That app, I think, includes a variety of meditations "
4188.12,that really encompasses the huge range of possibilities 
4192.05,"that are possible with meditation, "
4193.7,"and that, at least by my experience of the Waking Up app, "
4197.24,has led to my most consistent meditation practice. 
4200.84,"And, of course, I would love to get Sam "
4202.37,on the podcast as a guest 
4203.57,so we could talk about the sort of underpinnings 
4206.36,of the Waking Up app 
4207.29,and his views on everything from meditation 
4209.54,"to, I know he's big in the discussion "
4211.55,"about free will and consciousness, "
4212.99,some of the very deep and somewhat abstract discussions. 
4215.54,I really hope to get Sam on the podcast 
4217.25,at a time not too far from now. 
4219.02,"Meanwhile, we've never met in person, "
4221.39,"but I absolutely love the Waking Up app, Sam, "
4224.3,"and I know my father does as well, "
4226.19,and I know many of you already use it. 
4227.75,"If you haven't tried it already, "
4228.86,I really do encourage you to check it out. 
4230.84,I want to talk just briefly 
4232.01,about this third eye center business 
4234.02,because it turns out to be pretty interesting. 
4236.39,The third eye is actually a name 
4238.31,"that's been given to another neural structure, "
4241.37,"or I should say structure because it's not strictly neural, "
4243.77,"and that's the pineal gland, "
4245.39,and this has an interesting history. 
4247.31,I promise I'm not taking off on a tangent here 
4249.62,that isn't relevant to meditation. 
4251.99,"So you have a brain of course, "
4254.3,"and on both sides of your brain, "
4255.83,you tend to have mirror symmetric representations 
4258.65,of the same things. 
4259.483,What do I mean by that? 
4260.367,"Well, you have a prefrontal cortex on the right, "
4261.68,"you have a prefrontal cortex on the left, "
4263.09,and they actually do slightly different things. 
4264.83,"Language is sometimes lateralized to one side, "
4267.02,"but in general, for every structure "
4269.87,"that you have on one side of the brain, "
4271.43,you have the same structure 
4272.263,on the opposite side of the brain. 
4274.01,"There's one clear exception to that, "
4275.93,and that's the pineal gland. 
4277.34,"The pineal gland is the gland that makes melatonin, "
4280.82,"which, at night when it gets dark, secretes melatonin, "
4285.32,"and that melatonin makes you sleepy, "
4286.85,it helps you fall asleep but not stay asleep. 
4288.56,"Descartes, right, the philosopher Descartes "
4290.87,asserted that the pineal was the seat of the soul 
4293.45,because it was the one structure in the brain 
4296.12,"that he saw was not on both sides of the brain, "
4299.21,it was only one of them and in the middle. 
4301.82,"Now, I don't know if it's the seat of the soul or not, "
4303.98,I'm not in a position to make assessments like that. 
4307.88,But what do we know about the pineal? 
4309.59,"The pineal, as I mentioned, "
4310.79,"is involved in releasing melatonin, "
4312.38,"it does a few other things as well, "
4314.36,but it is also considered the third eye 
4318.83,for a couple of reasons. 
4320.0,"One is that it responds to light, "
4323.12,"although, in humans, not directly. "
4324.95,"So in birds and lizards and snakes, "
4326.66,"they actually either have a thin skull, "
4328.28,"or, believe it or not, two holes in the top of their skull "
4330.65,that allow light to go directly in. 
4332.63,"If you look at the head of a snake, "
4334.58,light can go directly into their brain through these holes 
4338.3,and activate the pineal to suppress melatonin 
4341.51,"and control their wakefulness, sleep rhythms. "
4344.96,"In birds, they don't have holes in their skull, "
4346.82,but they have very thin skulls. 
4348.26,"And, believe it or not, "
4349.1,light can penetrate the thinness of the skull in many birds 
4353.75,and communicates information about time of day 
4356.84,"and even time of year, "
4358.04,and that's translating to hormonal signals 
4360.23,such as melatonin release from the pineal. 
4362.42,And so the pineal has been called the third eye 
4365.03,because it's a light-sensitive organ inside the brain. 
4368.3,"In humans, the pineal sits deep, deep, deep to the surface, "
4373.22,and light cannot get in there. 
4374.57,"In fact, if light can get into your brain, "
4377.27,unless you are part of a specific experiment 
4379.46,where that's the intention 
4381.26,"or you're having neurosurgery or something of that sort, "
4383.66,then you've got serious issues happening. 
4386.48,"That pineal sits deep, deep, deep "
4388.64,"near what's called the fourth ventricle, "
4390.86,and it absolutely should not see light directly. 
4394.82,So the idea that the pineal 
4396.07,is the third eye in humans is not true. 
4399.8,It just isn't true. 
4400.633,"So anytime someone says, ""Oh, the pineal is your third eye."" "
4403.31,That's not the third eye center that people are referring to 
4406.37,when they talk about meditation. 
4408.44,"Now, you'll see a number of different forms of art "
4412.58,where it will be a picture of a face 
4415.73,"and the eyes will be closed or sometimes open, "
4417.35,"and there'll be literally a third eye, "
4418.61,like a cyclops eye in the middle of the forehead. 
4421.58,That has been proposed for many thousands of years 
4424.85,"to be, quote, unquote, the seat of our consciousness. "
4428.0,"Now, that's interesting "
4429.08,because that real estate behind the forehead 
4432.35,"actually turns out to be the prefrontal cortex, "
4434.18,"which we know from lesion studies and stimulation studies, "
4437.24,"if you remove that brain area, people become very reflexive. "
4440.96,"They are not thinking intentionally, "
4443.54,they don't become deliberate. 
4444.71,"In fact, and this is kind of an eerie result, "
4447.71,"but if you inactivate, you turn off the prefrontal cortex "
4453.23,and you give somebody the opportunity 
4455.42,"to play a shooting game, for instance, "
4457.97,their accuracy goes through the roof. 
4460.55,They become essentially like a machine. 
4461.96,"They see a stimulus, they shoot at it, "
4463.22,"they see a stimulus, they shoot at it. "
4464.81,"Their accuracy is exceptional, "
4466.67,but their ability to distinguish 
4469.64,between enemy and friend completely disappears. 
4474.14,"So they become a highly effective motor, "
4477.23,"or I should say sensory motor machine, "
4480.2,but their assessment and their judgment 
4482.72,about right or wrong completely disappears. 
4485.06,This is also true for people that have prefrontal damage. 
4487.76,They often will have inappropriate behavior 
4489.92,"or a hard time suppressing behaviors, et cetera. "
4492.44,So the third eye center 
4494.51,as the seat of consciousness and our intention 
4497.54,is something that makes sense generally 
4500.27,"with what we know about the neuroscience and neurology, "
4502.76,but there's something more to it 
4504.05,that I think is especially important for all of you 
4506.21,that goes beyond anything about ancient traditions 
4508.61,or pineals or birds or snakes 
4510.2,"and pits in the top of the head, and here's what it is. "
4514.19,"The brain itself, meaning the brain tissue, "
4517.46,does not have any sensory neurons. 
4521.45,What do I mean by that? 
4522.32,"Well, if I touch the top of my hand, I can feel that. "
4525.59,"If I want to sense my heartbeat, "
4528.5,"if I work at it, I can feel that. "
4531.02,If I want to sense how I feel internally 
4533.96,"at the level of my stomach, "
4535.28,"is it full, is it empty, am I hungry, is it acidic, "
4537.71,"does it ache or does it feel pleasant, et cetera, "
4540.02,I can sense that. 
4541.73,And that's because we have sensory neurons 
4543.62,"on our skin and in our body, et cetera. "
4545.3,We also have sensory neurons in our eyes 
4546.71,that let us perceive things externally. 
4548.6,We have no sensory neurons on our brain. 
4551.24,This is one of the reasons why you can remove the skull 
4554.09,and do brain surgery on somebody who's wide awake 
4556.52,"and be poking around in there, "
4557.54,and they don't need any anesthetic on the brain itself. 
4560.24,"They need anesthetic for the incision site, "
4562.97,but they don't need anesthetic on the brain 
4564.44,because it has no feeling. 
4566.78,"You have emotions, but there's no feeling. "
4569.39,"So normally, we are perceiving and paying attention "
4573.23,"to what we are sensing, "
4574.46,"either externally, sight and sounds, again, exteroception, "
4577.19,"or internally, interoception, touch, et cetera. "
4580.73,But by focusing our perception and our attention 
4584.09,"not on our bodily surface like a body scan, "
4587.33,but to a point a couple centimeters or inches 
4590.36,"behind our forehead, "
4592.4,"we essentially are bringing that attentional, "
4594.74,that perceptual spotlight 
4596.18,to a location in which there is no sensation. 
4600.2,There's nothing to feel there. 
4602.21,"And when we do that, by closing our eyes "
4604.07,"and focusing on that, quote, unquote, third eye center, "
4606.59,"which is the prefrontal cortex, to be quite honest, "
4610.28,"when we do that, something else happens. "
4614.24,And what happens is when we are not thinking about 
4617.51,"and perceiving our sensations, because there are none there, "
4621.83,our thoughts and our emotions and our memories 
4624.86,sort of mushroom up. 
4626.51,A better way to put it would be that they geyser up 
4629.42,and take on more prominence in our perception. 
4632.87,"What I mean by this is that normally, "
4635.15,"you know, I'm not thinking about the contact point "
4638.09,"between me and this chair, "
4639.8,"but as I'm speaking, I'm in contact with the chair "
4642.77,and those neurons are firing. 
4644.51,"But if I focus my energy and attention on them, "
4647.54,they're going to fire the same 
4648.77,but more of my perception goes there. 
4650.45,"Similarly, I'm thinking things all the time. You are too. "
4653.39,"And I'm perceiving things all the time, "
4655.04,"and I'm remembering things all the time, "
4656.237,and I'm anticipating things all the time about the future. 
4659.27,But by focusing my attention on the one organ 
4662.81,"for which I have no sensation, "
4665.78,"that is, my brain, "
4667.55,"well, then thoughts, feelings, and memories, "
4672.14,"feelings meaning emotional feelings, "
4674.78,start to grow in their prominence 
4678.11,in my awareness and in my perception. 
4680.42,And so this is why 
4681.68,"when you sit down to a meditative practice, "
4683.63,if it's a meditative practice where you close your eyes 
4685.67,"or you're focused on that third eye center, "
4687.71,where you're focused on your brain 
4690.56,as opposed to your bodily surface 
4692.0,"or something external to you, "
4693.95,"the thoughts seem to come by in waves, "
4696.92,and they can almost be overwhelming. 
4698.3,"It's very hard to, as it's often described, "
4701.42,just sit back and watch your thoughts go by 
4703.19,because there are so many of them. 
4704.87,"Actually, the best way to stop thinking "
4706.43,is to really focus on something external 
4709.7,or to focus on sensation. 
4711.89,"That's less thinking than it is perceiving senses, okay? "
4716.03,So I don't want this to get too abstract. 
4718.4,"When people talk about the third eye center, "
4719.9,"they're not talking about the pineal, "
4721.13,"they're talking about prefrontal cortex, "
4722.45,and when you direct your own attention 
4724.37,"to the very area of your brain that directs attention, "
4727.34,there's nothing to sense there. 
4729.5,The only things that will become present to you 
4732.26,"are feelings, emotions, that is, "
4736.31,"thoughts and memories, "
4739.04,and they will often arrive 
4740.39,in what seems to be a very disorganized fashion. 
4742.79,And the reason they arrive in somewhat disorganized fashion 
4746.81,"is because, normally, "
4748.52,we just don't perceive things that way. 
4750.59,"Normally, we are splitting our attention, "
4752.87,"our perception, that is, "
4754.28,"to multiple things, our sensation and our thoughts. "
4757.46,"When we put all of our perception into our thoughts, "
4760.13,"we see how disorganized, how wandering they are "
4763.37,"and how, in fact, how random and intrusive those can be. "
4767.54,"Again, random and intrusive. "
4769.4,"And much of what we talked about in that paper earlier, "
4772.04,"the one where they asked people, "
4773.42,what are you doing and what are you feeling 
4774.62,"and how happy or how unhappy you are, "
4776.66,what they discovered was that most people 
4780.35,are sort of in their head a lot. 
4782.15,"They're not really present to what they're doing, "
4784.52,"which leads me to the statement that I believe, "
4786.95,"at least based on the data, that paper included, "
4789.41,that most people have an interoceptive bias. 
4793.73,They're focused more on what's going on internally 
4796.01,than they are focused on what's happening externally. 
4798.59,"There are certainly people who for the opposite is true, "
4802.16,but I think that this is an issue 
4804.77,because we hear so often about the need 
4807.77,to do a meditation practice that allows us to focus inward 
4811.61,and that we're getting yanked around 
4812.9,"by all the stressors of life, et cetera, et cetera. "
4815.09,"And we are, we're getting yanked around "
4816.56,by all the stressors and demands of life. 
4818.69,"But as we do that, "
4820.34,we tend to be very focused on what's happening with us. 
4822.95,The data clearly point to the fact 
4824.9,that being mindful and being aware 
4827.18,can enhance one's level of presence and happiness. 
4831.05,But we can go so far as to say 
4832.91,"that being mindful and aware of what's happening, "
4835.07,not just with us 
4836.24,"but external to us in our immediate environment, "
4838.46,"that includes what other people are saying and doing, "
4840.8,that also can really enhance our sense 
4843.5,of well-being and happiness. 
4844.79,At least that's what the data point to. 
4846.5,Let's briefly recap where we've been so far. 
4849.29,We've talked a little bit about the brain networks 
4851.78,"that are activated during meditation, "
4853.7,"which include prefrontal cortex, ACC, the insula. "
4857.3,We also talked about the difference 
4858.47,between interoception and exteroception 
4861.05,and the importance of assessing where you are 
4864.32,along that continuum. 
4865.79,"And I should mention, of course, "
4866.99,that you can be right in the middle of that continuum. 
4869.66,You might sit down to do meditation 
4871.19,and find that you are smack dab in the middle 
4873.47,of being able to attend to things outside of you 
4876.08,but also attending to things inside of you. 
4877.94,"In which case, I suggest doing a meditation "
4880.91,that is either exteroceptive-biased or interoceptive-biased. 
4884.45,"But as I mentioned earlier, "
4886.28,"if you find that you are more, quote, unquote, in your head "
4888.98,"or in your body, "
4889.88,"well, then focus on an exteroceptive-biased meditation "
4893.57,to build up that set of circuits. 
4895.97,Whereas if you are more exteroceptively focused 
4898.64,"at any given moment, "
4899.81,"well, then I encourage you "
4900.74,to do an interoceptively focused meditation practice. 
4903.92,"And as I mentioned earlier, "
4905.54,there is this issue of how long to do a practice. 
4908.15,"There are a lot of different data on these, "
4909.68,but some of the practices 
4911.81,we've covered on this podcast before 
4913.22,"when we had guests, for instance, "
4914.84,highlighted the 
13-minute,meditation 
4917.21,that Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University's laboratory 
4920.51,"has popularized, "
4921.74,and they popularized it because they have a wonderful paper 
4924.11,that we will provide a link to 
4925.82,which shows that a daily 
13-minute,"meditation, "
4929.24,"which is of the traditional third eye, "
4931.55,"interoceptively biased, focus on breathing, "
4933.68,and focus on that location 
4935.09,"directly behind one's forehead or both, "
4937.1,"that meditation done daily for about eight weeks, "
4940.01,"maybe shorter, but in that study, eight weeks, "
4942.74,"greatly improved mood, improved ability to sleep, "
4945.56,"improved cognitive ability and focus, memory, "
4948.2,a huge number of metrics were looked at very specifically. 
4951.77,So that's a terrific one. 
4952.603,"And you may be asking yourself, "
4953.84,do you need to do the full 
13,minutes? 
4955.46,Could you get away with five minutes or three minutes? 
4957.38,"Well, my laboratory has shown benefits in stress reduction, "
4960.35,"improvement in sleep, et cetera, "
4962.09,with a five-minute-a-day meditation. 
4965.12,"However, in trying to establish "
4966.53,"how long you should meditate, "
4968.12,I would ask yourself a couple of questions. 
4969.77,"First of all, what is a practice "
4971.48,that you can do consistently? 
4973.13,"And by consistently, "
4974.0,that doesn't necessarily mean every day. 
4976.76,"If you answer the question about consistency honestly, "
4980.42,and you find that you can only do 
4982.04,"one meditation session per week, "
4984.05,"well, then I would encourage you to go a little bit longer, "
4986.06,maybe 
10,or 
15,"minutes, maybe even "
30,minutes. 
4988.52,"Again, understanding that you're going to have to refocus "
4990.83,repeatedly throughout that meditation 
4992.84,regardless of whether or not you're focusing 
4994.25,on internal perceptions or external perceptions. 
4997.19,"If, however, you can set aside "
5,or 
10,or 
15,minutes per day 
5001.96,"and you can meditate every day, "
5003.61,"well, then I think you have a bit more flexibility "
5006.34,in terms of how long you meditate. 
5007.6,"Maybe it's three minutes one day, one minute the next day, "
5010.3,
10,"minutes the next, and so on and so forth. "
5012.49,"Just like with exercise, the key component is consistency, "
5015.97,and this is borne out in all the data 
5017.59,"that's covered in ""Altered Traits."" "
5019.57,It's also borne out in all the recent studies 
5022.09,that have come out since that book was published. 
5024.28,"Consistency is key, "
5025.54,"so ask yourself what you can do consistently, "
5027.91,and also don't necessarily burden yourself 
5030.79,with always having to do the same amount 
5033.04,or duration of meditation. 
5034.6,"So earlier, we decided we were going to parse "
5037.15,"or fine slice the meditation practice, "
5039.64,and indeed we've been doing that. 
5041.02,"We've talked about interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias, "
5044.74,and we've been talking about 
5046.24,where you place your perception or your focus. 
5049.27,Another key component of meditation 
5051.91,is the pattern of breathing that you embrace. 
5054.37,"In fact, the pattern of breathing "
5056.38,that you embrace during your meditation practice 
5058.78,can itself be its own form of meditation. 
5062.56,What do I mean by that? 
5063.64,"Well, these days, we hear a lot about breathwork. "
5066.4,Breathwork has really grown in popularity 
5068.5,in the last 
"5,",
10,"years, "
5070.03,and there are a number of reasons for that. 
5071.56,"First of all, I think we need to credit Wim Hof, "
5074.53,"or can we call him, I think appropriately, "
5076.27,the Great Wim Hof? 
5077.53,"You know, certainly there were people before Wim "
5079.39,who were doing deliberate breathwork 
5080.77,"and talking about deliberate breathwork, "
5082.6,but it was really about 
2015,or so 
5086.2,that Wim Hof started to grow in recognition and popularity 
5090.4,"for a particular style of breathing, "
5092.26,"which, in the laboratory, we call cyclic hyperventilation. "
5095.38,I know there are other names for it 
5096.85,that come from ancient traditions. 
5098.38,"He named it, or people named it after him, Wim Hof. "
5102.58,"Wim Hof, for those of you that don't know, "
5104.68,is a Dutchman who is known to hold many world records 
5109.45,"for deliberate cold exposure, "
5111.31,"including swimming under icebergs, longest period of time "
5114.82,"buried in ice up to his neck, et cetera, "
5117.07,but who's also expert 
5118.39,in the use of breathing in particular ways 
5120.49,in order to manage and maneuver through those challenges. 
5123.76,And he started speaking about 
5125.2,"different patterns of breathwork, "
5126.25,"in particular, the use of cyclic hyperventilation, "
5129.94,"deep, deliberate breathing, "
5131.62,"so big inhales [inhales], exhales [exhales], "
5134.56,big inhales [inhales and exhales] exhales. 
5137.04,"In the laboratory, again, "
5138.04,we call that cyclic hyperventilation. 
5139.57,It's very clear from studies both done on Wim specifically 
5143.32,but on the general population as well 
5145.0,by my lab and other labs 
5146.53,"that that pattern of cyclic hyperventilation, "
5148.66,"of deliberately breathing deeply and repetitively, "
5151.51,"typically in through the nose, out through the mouth, "
5154.06,generates a lot of adrenaline 
5155.47,or causes adrenaline release from the brain and body. 
5158.53,"It, quote, unquote, heats up the body. "
5161.26,"Indeed, it raises body temperature, "
5163.06,but the liberation of adrenaline does a number of things 
5165.61,to shift the state of the brain and body. 
5168.58,"That, more or less, is what Wim Hof breathing is, "
5170.95,"although Wim Hof breathing, "
5172.3,or some people will call it tummo breathing 
5174.28,"or cyclic hyperventilation, "
5176.17,is not a pattern of breathing 
5177.85,"typical of most meditations that have been discussed, "
5181.39,at least not in the research literature. 
5183.34,"Now, that's not to say that cyclic hyperventilation "
5185.68,"can't be incorporated into a meditation practice, "
5188.23,but Wim Hof breathing aka cyclic hyperventilation/tummo 
5192.13,"is typically considered its own practice, okay? "
5195.61,Its own breathwork practice divorced from meditation. 
5198.88,"It might have a meditative component, "
5200.38,but it's not often discussed as meditation 
5202.94,or as part of meditation. 
5204.61,"More typically, a meditation practice "
5207.07,"involves slowing one's breathing, "
5209.47,and this could be in the form of cyclic breathing 
5212.56,"of inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, which is cyclic, "
5216.16,"or, in some cases, doubling up on inhales and then exhaling, "
5219.67,"so inhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, inhale, exhale, "
5222.37,"or controlling the duration of inhale, breath hold, "
5226.21,"exhale, breath hold, repeat, "
5228.07,so-called box breathing 
5229.51,"where the inhale, the hold, the exhale, and the hold "
5232.0,are of equivalent durations. 
5234.55,"Any number of different breathing patterns, "
5236.71,"slow cyclic breathing, box breathing, "
5240.25,"a cadence of three to six seconds in, "
5243.28,"holding for two seconds, and seven seconds out, "
5245.77,"regardless of what cadence of breathing one uses, "
5249.34,there is a tendency during most meditative practices 
5252.88,to slow one's breathing and/or control one's breathing 
5256.69,in deliberate fashion. 
5258.49,"This is essential because when we default our breathing, "
5262.3,"that is, when we don't pay attention "
5264.88,"to how long we are inhaling relative to our exhales, "
5268.84,"when we don't deliberately exhale, "
5271.12,"that is, normally we just passively exhale "
5274.36,"but we actively inhale, "
5275.65,"I repeat that, "
5276.483,"normally, when we're not thinking about breathing, "
5278.77,"we deliberately inhale, "
5280.69,"there's a a motor command that's sent to inflate the lungs, "
5283.69,and then we passively exhale. 
5285.19,"But in many breathwork practices or meditation practices, "
5288.4,we actually actively exhale as well. 
5291.85,"Well, when we do that, a number of things happen. "
5294.04,"First of all, it forces us into interoception. Why? "
5298.33,"Because the diaphragm, "
5299.35,the muscle that helps move the lungs essentially 
5303.07,and create a specific cadence of breathing 
5307.09,or depth of breathing 
5308.89,as one would with box breathing 
5310.47,"or deliberately slow breathing, "
5312.49,"well, that muscle resides inside of us, "
5314.89,"and so when we focus on our breathing, "
5317.62,"more often than not, we aren't focused "
5319.51,"on the actual air leaving our nasal passages or mouth, "
5322.48,"maybe a little bit, "
5323.41,"but more typically, we are forced to focus "
5326.02,or we just default to focusing 
5327.61,on the movement of our diaphragm or of our belly 
5330.31,or the rising and falling of our chest. 
5333.22,All of that is to say 
5334.87,"that by deliberately focusing on our breathing, "
5337.63,we shift to interoception. 
5341.05,So breathing and specific patterns of breathing 
5343.957,"are sort of along for the ride in meditation, "
5348.01,"but the reverse can also be said, "
5350.14,"that when we focus on our breathing, "
5352.03,we shift to interoception and away from external events. 
5355.96,It doesn't mean we can't still pay attention 
5357.79,"to external events, we can still exterocept, "
5360.55,"but at least some portion of our perception, "
5362.83,of our attention shifts to interoception. 
5366.55,So we of course need to breathe to stay alive. 
5370.18,We have to breathe at least every so often 
5372.49,"in order to stay alive, "
5373.48,"so, of course, breathing is part of any meditative practice, "
5376.72,"just like it's part of any living activity, even sleep. "
5380.89,But if the first component of meditation 
5384.13,"is to direct our perception in a deliberate way, "
5387.85,"using that prefrontal cortex, "
5389.2,"to a specific location, either on the surface of "
5392.2,"or within our body or external to our body, "
5396.49,"or both, but typically one or the other, "
5398.74,then we can say that the second element 
5401.41,"of a meditative practice is the pattern of breathing, "
5404.89,"and we can ask ourselves, "
5407.11,can it and should it be deliberate or not? 
5410.13,"In other words, do we just default "
5411.64,"to however we happen to be breathing, "
5413.32,or should it be deliberate? 
5414.4,"That is, should we be controlling the depth and the cadence? "
5418.33,"And I do believe that, "
5419.98,based on what we know about the capacity 
5422.02,"for specific patterns of breathing to shift our brain state, "
5426.01,that controlling one's pattern of breathing 
5428.53,"during meditation can be enormously useful, "
5431.02,and that is true regardless of whether or not 
5433.33,one is focusing on interoceptive perceptions within our body 
5438.67,or exteroceptive perceptions. 
5441.73,"So that raises the question, "
5442.78,how should we breathe during meditation? 
5444.82,"Well, there is, again, "
5447.04,"no simple one-size-fits-all rule there, "
5449.95,but there are some general rules of respiration physiology 
5453.64,that can help us access and develop a meditation practice 
5457.24,that is going to best serve our goals. 
5459.64,"And since this is not an episode all about respiration, "
5463.06,"and we will do one, "
5464.95,I simply want to give you the basics 
5466.9,of what respiration can do 
5468.4,to shift your brain and body state. 
5471.55,"Before I do that, however, "
5472.96,"I want to give a very specific instruction, "
5476.05,"which is when you sit down to meditate, "
5478.24,"or if you're going to do your meditation walking, "
5480.61,that's fine too. 
5481.443,I should just say when you are about to begin 
5483.61,"your meditative practice, "
5485.32,you need to ask yourself a question. 
5488.38,"Do you want to be more relaxed than you are at present, "
5493.36,or do you want to be more alert than you are at present 
5496.51,when you exit the meditation practice? 
5499.06,"Do you want to calm down, "
5500.53,or do you want to become more alert? 
5502.27,Simple question. You can decide from session to session. 
5506.5,You could even switch within a session. 
5508.33,But just as you need to assess whether or not 
5510.22,"you are leaning more interoceptively or exteroceptively, "
5514.66,"you also need to ask yourself, "
5516.52,"do you need to calm down or want to calm down, "
5518.47,or do you want to be more alert 
5519.88,at the end of your meditation session? 
5521.71,Or maybe you want to go into a state of deep relaxation 
5523.99,and then exit with more alertness. 
5526.69,The way to do that is very simple 
5528.64,using breathwork and specific patterns of breathing. 
5532.12,And here is the general rule that is supported 
5535.09,by all the respiration physiology that I'm aware of. 
5538.78,"I'm oversimplifying here, "
5539.98,but I'm oversimplifying intentionally 
5542.23,so you can simply apply the tool. 
5543.88,"And then, as I mentioned before, we will do an episode "
5546.37,all about respiration physiology in the future. 
5550.12,"Essentially, if your inhales "
5554.77,"are longer and/or more vigorous than your exhales, "
5558.58,then you will tend to be more alert 
5561.76,or you'll shift your brain and body 
5563.08,towards a state of more alertness. 
5564.55,This is simply based on the way that the neural circuits 
5567.91,like the pre-Botzinger nucleus and the parafacial nucleus 
5570.25,"that govern respiration physiology and alertness, "
5573.16,it's simply the way they work. 
5574.24,They communicate with brain areas 
5575.47,"that release noradrenaline and norepinephrine, et cetera. "
5580.15,"In contrast, if you emphasize longer duration "
5585.25,"and/or more vigorous exhales relative to your inhales, "
5590.56,"you will tend to relax more, "
5592.48,you will tend to calm your nervous system. 
5594.88,"Now, you might be saying, ""Okay, I understand what it is "
5596.86,"to make an inhale longer than my exhale, "
5599.47,"but how do I make it more vigorous?"" "
5601.12,"Well, it simply means drawing more air into your lungs "
5603.61,more quickly than you allow yourself to exhale that air. 
5608.59,So an example of inhale-biased breathwork 
5611.77,"would be [inhales and exhales] [inhales and exhales], "
5615.85,"so there's an active emphasis on the inhale, "
5618.85,and it's a little bit longer than the exhale 
5620.71,which is passive. 
5623.11,"Conversely, if you want to relax, "
5625.48,then you want to extend your exhales 
5627.28,"relative to your inhales, "
5628.27,and you can even make them active exhales. 
5630.55,"So it can be inhale [inhales and exhales], "
5634.36,exhale [inhales and exhales]. 
5637.81,That's going to shift your nervous system 
5639.73,in a direction of more calm. 
5642.7,"And, of course, if you would like to stay "
5644.98,at the level of alertness aka calmness 
5648.31,because those are two sides 
5649.33,"of the same seesaw or the same continuum, "
5651.91,if you'd like to be right where you're at 
5653.89,"at the end of your meditation as where you started, "
5656.38,"at least in terms of levels of alertness and calmness, "
5658.93,"well, then you would just keep your inhales and your exhales "
5662.02,relatively balanced in terms of duration. 
5664.78,"Now, the introduction of things like breath holds "
5666.73,"with box breathing or Wim Hof breathing, "
5669.37,"typically, it's "
25,or 
30,"deep inhale, exhales, "
5673.12,"deep inhale, exhales, and then exhale all your air, "
5675.79,hold your breath for 
15,to 
60,"seconds, "
5677.8,"and then repeat and so on, sometimes some inhales and holds. "
5681.28,"Well, that's a whole business into itself. "
5683.59,"But for sake of meditation, the key thing to understand "
5687.25,is that if you are going to do 
5688.78,"a complicated breathing practice, "
5691.72,"it will, by design, by necessity, "
5694.66,"shift much of your attention to the breathing practice, "
5697.9,"especially if it's not cyclic, "
5699.16,if it's not inhales follow exhales. 
5701.05,"Cyclic breathing is where inhales always follow exhales, "
5703.42,"follow inhales, follow exhales. "
5704.65,It actually relies on a specific brain center 
5706.96,called the pre-Botzinger complex 
5708.31,discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA. 
5710.08,He was a guest on this podcast previously. 
5713.44,"However, if you are doubling up on your inhale, "
5715.72,"so two inhales [inhaling], and then an exhale [exhales], "
5719.68,a pattern of breathing 
5720.513,"my laboratory has studied extensively, "
5722.98,"well, then that relies on a different brain center, "
5725.08,the parafacial nucleus. 
5726.16,The point is that if you are engaging in noncyclic breathing 
5730.81,or you are deliberately emphasizing inhales or exhales 
5735.34,"or the vigor of inhales and exhales, et cetera, "
5738.34,"well, then some portion of your attention will be devoted "
5741.64,to making sure that you follow that breathing practice. 
5744.01,We are very good at going into cyclic breathing practices 
5747.46,"by default, and our attention can drift to other things. "
5750.55,"Interoceptive or exteroceptive, it doesn't matter, "
5753.85,"we can just drift into, you know, how our body feels "
5756.49,"or something we see or hear in the room, et cetera. "
5759.37,When we are focused on our breathing 
5760.84,and the breathing pattern 
5761.74,is noncyclic or complex in some way 
5765.31,"in that it involves deliberate voluntary commands, "
5769.33,"again, from those so-called top-down mechanisms "
5772.27,"of the prefrontal cortex, "
5773.68,"well, that, by design, requires some portion, "
5778.6,often a significant portion of our attention 
5780.7,to be devoted to the breathing practice itself. 
5783.58,So what does this mean? 
5784.413,This means that breathwork itself 
5786.49,"can be a form of meditation, "
5788.26,"and meditation can involve breathwork, "
5791.86,but one should know that the more deliberate and unnatural 
5797.68,"that pattern of breathing is, "
5800.17,the less you will be able to focus on other things. 
5803.26,"Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. "
5804.94,You can actually leverage this. 
5806.08,"So for instance, if you are somebody "
5807.64,"who's very much caught in your own head, "
5809.98,"right, we talked about this earlier, "
5811.87,or you're in a moment where you're really stuck in your head 
5813.577,"and you want to get out of your head, "
5815.32,"well, then that meditation practice that you do "
5817.03,"really should be focused on exteroceptive bias, "
5819.37,"you should really focus on something external to you, "
5821.35,and I would encourage you 
5822.31,to use a natural cyclic pattern of breathing 
5825.49,where inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales. 
5828.85,"If, however, you are finding "
5830.47,that you're sort of caught in the landscape 
5832.78,of things happening around you 
5834.34,"and you want to ground yourself, as it's sometimes called... "
5837.07,"That's a loose language, not a scientific language. "
5839.35,"I know there's this practice of grounding, "
5840.97,and that's a whole thing. 
5841.803,"People are always writing to me, "
5842.636,"""Is grounding a real thing, walking barefoot on the Earth "
5845.35,"and magnetic fields, you know, and gravitational fields?"" "
5848.14,"Well, gravity's real, "
5849.49,"but, you know, grounding, "
5850.78,"there isn't a lot of science for it, to be frank. "
5853.45,"It does feel nice to walk on the ground, however. "
5855.76,But if you are somebody who's kind of feeling 
5859.09,pulled out of yourself a lot or in a moment 
5861.46,and you want to bring your awareness into your body 
5864.88,"and sort of calm down, "
5866.44,"well, then I would encourage you "
5868.24,"to, yes, use a deliberate, somewhat unnatural "
5872.35,"or non-default pattern of breathing, "
5875.59,"which, by definition, will force you "
5877.87,to attend to what's going on interoceptively. 
5881.89,"Again, I'm not aware of any place "
5883.27,that this has been discussed in detail such as this before. 
5886.0,"If there is a research literature on this, "
5888.61,please let me know. 
5889.443,My laboratory has been working on this extensively. 
5891.19,I'm always looking for new colleagues and collaborators. 
5894.49,"We, meaning Dr. David Spiegel who's an expert in hypnosis, "
5897.49,"again, who's been a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast "
5901.18,and my colleague at Stanford Psychiatry. 
5902.86,"In fact, he's our associate chair of psychiatry, "
5904.72,"world expert in hypnosis, he's been on this podcast before, "
5907.18,we have an active research program focused on these issues. 
5910.84,We are very much of the belief 
5912.19,"that a breathwork practice itself can be meditative, "
5915.43,"a meditation practice can include breathing, "
5918.46,but the more that that meditative practice 
5920.77,"focuses on the breathing itself, "
5922.63,the more interoceptive-biased it will be. 
5925.24,"Now, it's very important to understand "
5927.97,that an interoceptive-biased breathwork practice 
5931.15,"will have a specific effect, "
5933.16,which is to make you more interoceptively aware. 
5936.1,"And if you think back to earlier in the episode, "
5938.56,"for many people, that will be a wonderful thing "
5940.78,and something that they are actively seeking 
5943.36,or ought to seek 
5944.89,"because it can help people gain awareness, "
5946.99,"for instance, you know, if they're stressed "
5949.27,"and they're not realizing it till the end of the day, "
5951.01,"they're just exhausted, "
5952.27,more interoceptive awareness throughout the day 
5954.13,can be very beneficial. 
5956.08,"If, however, you are somebody "
5957.91,"who is overly focused on your bodily sensations, "
5960.76,"well, then more exteroception awareness is important. "
5963.52,And this brings us to a yet larger theme 
5966.25,but a theme that I think really emphasizes 
5969.16,what particular types of meditative practices 
5971.35,"are going to be best for certain people, "
5973.66,especially people who are using meditation 
5976.03,"to combat certain challenges, "
5977.8,"in particular, mood-based challenges "
5979.54,or sleep-based challenges or focus-based challenges. 
5983.2,I haven't listed off 
5984.19,"all the positive benefits of meditation yet in this episode, "
5989.38,"but they are many, many, many. "
5991.87,"In fact, there are now tens of thousands "
5994.21,"of scientific studies showing, for instance, "
5996.91,there are known benefits of doing meditation 
5999.88,"for enhancing sleep, "
6001.35,there are known benefits of a regular meditation practice 
6003.66,"for enhancing focus, "
6004.98,there are known benefits of a regular meditation practice 
6007.35,"for reducing inflammatory cytokines, "
6009.96,"even improving outcomes in cancer, "
6011.58,"reducing pain, improving mood, "
6015.3,reducing the symptoms of ADHD and clinically diagnosed HD 
6018.39,and on and on and on. 
6020.04,"And, again, rather than focus "
6022.02,on all those beautiful studies today 
6024.21,which all basically point to the fact 
6025.65,"that some meditation practice done regularly, "
6028.8,"even if it's very brief, "
6029.94,"has tremendous, even outsized benefits on our health "
6032.79,"even relative to some drug treatments, that's been shown. "
6036.21,"Rather than focus on all that, I've been more focused "
6038.79,on what sorts of brain and body changes occur 
6041.25,when we do a meditation practice 
6042.66,"and, perhaps more importantly, "
6043.86,what really constitutes a meditation practice. 
6046.68,We have this thing about a continuum of perception. 
6049.71,We also now are talking about breathing. 
6051.57,"Well, there's another component that I'd like to raise now, "
6054.66,which we could say is the third major component 
6056.4,if the first one that I raised 
6058.23,"was interoceptive versus exteroceptive bias or continuum, "
6062.37,"the second being breathing, "
6064.04,is it going to be default or deliberate breathing? 
6067.14,Is it going to be natural cadence or unnatural cadence? 
6069.75,"Again, no right or wrong, "
6072.09,it just depends on what your goal is. 
6073.98,There's a third component. 
6075.96,"This is a component, "
6077.1,"again, that hasn't really been formalized in the literature "
6079.29,but that Dr. Spiegel and I are working hard to formalize 
6083.25,through some research and through an upcoming review 
6085.71,"that we will provide links to once it's out, "
6087.51,and that's a separate continuum which is the continuum 
6090.75,between interoception and dissociation. 
6095.19,"So now all of you know what interoception is, "
6098.01,but most people probably don't know 
6100.11,or don't realize what dissociation is. 
6102.84,"Often we hear about dissociation, "
6105.15,sometimes called disassociation. 
6107.28,Some people pronounce it dissociation. Guess what? 
6111.0,Despite being corrected many times 
6112.53,"for each of those pronunciations, "
6114.03,I checked with my colleagues 
6115.44,"who are experts in dissociation or disassociation, "
6119.55,and guess what? 
6120.383,"They're the same thing. Tomato, tomato, potato, potato. "
6123.78,So I'm going to say dissociation. 
6125.7,"Some people will say disassociation, like I disassociate. "
6129.51,"Other people will say I dissociate, okay? "
6132.33,Both of those refer to essentially the same thing. 
6135.6,Dissociation is often talked about 
6139.23,in the context of a negative event. 
6141.27,"And indeed, dissociation is unfortunately, "
6145.47,"or, I should say, is adaptively associated "
6148.26,with traumatic events. 
6149.88,"In particular, violent or sexual trauma, people will report "
6153.3,feeling out of body or out of the experience 
6157.41,during the experience 
6158.25,or during a recollection of the experience. 
6161.25,Dissociation has also been described 
6163.65,in terms of people who are in a traumatic accident 
6166.98,or they see someone killed right in front of them. 
6169.26,First responders will talk about dissociating 
6171.27,when they arrive on a scene. 
6172.47,"I don't want to provide, you know, gruesome imagery here "
6174.39,"'cause I know people can be pretty sensitive to this, "
6176.04,"but, you know, showing up on the scene of a car crash "
6179.58,and just seeing carnage or incredible damage to bodies 
6184.26,"or, you know, this sort of thing. "
6186.03,Dissociation lies at the opposite end 
6188.19,of a continuum with interoception. 
6190.53,"Now, earlier, I said that interoception "
6192.48,"is on the opposite end of a continuum with exteroception, "
6195.27,but it also is on the opposite end 
6197.19,of a continuum with dissociation. 
6200.13,We can provide some better definitions perhaps 
6202.44,"to make this crystal clear, "
6204.06,"and here, I'm actually reading from an upcoming review. "
6206.58,I feel comfortable reading from it 
6207.69,because I'm an author on the review. 
6209.1,"But nonetheless, interoception refers to a process "
6211.95,"by which your nervous system, "
6213.24,"meaning your brain and connections with your body, "
6214.86,"senses, interprets, integrates, and regulates signals "
6217.89,"originating from within the body, "
6220.56,and thereby provides a moment-to-moment mapping 
6222.84,of your internal landscape 
6224.52,at both a conscious and unconscious level. 
6226.47,"Okay, that's a lot of words "
6227.88,to describe basically the process 
6230.01,of perceiving what's happening 
6231.09,at the level of the surface of your skin or inward. 
6235.74,Dissociation can be thought of 
6237.3,as the opposite of interoception. 
6240.51,It's a lack of bodily awareness 
6242.28,or a removal of one's conscious experience 
6246.03,from one's bodily experience and awareness. 
6249.36,"Again, this is most often talked about "
6251.25,"in the context of something traumatic, "
6253.26,"but really, if we think about health "
6256.05,"and mental health and physical health, "
6258.09,the optimal place to reside 
6259.74,on the continuum between interoception and dissociation 
6262.8,is somewhere in the middle. 
6263.94,"We don't want to be dissociated from life's experiences, "
6266.73,but we also don't want everything that happens in the world 
6270.51,to profoundly impact our heart rate and our breathing. 
6273.09,We'd be yanked around by every experience. 
6275.94,There are instances in which being yanked around 
6279.78,or pulled into an experience 
6281.31,"is something that we desire and want, "
6282.69,like seeing a movie that we want to see 
6285.03,"or, for instance, clinical hypnosis or falling in love, "
6290.43,wonderful experiences 
6291.54,"and sometimes also sad experiences, right? "
6293.7,Being able to feel one's feelings 
6295.05,depending on life's events is important. 
6298.11,"But being too dissociated or being too feeling, "
6302.31,"that is, feeling so much "
6304.44,in response to everything that happens is also problematic. 
6307.74,"There are certain people, for instance, that have challenges "
6310.44,with what's called narrative distancing. 
6313.11,"That is, they see someone in a movie getting hit "
6315.18,and they almost flinch as if they are getting hit. 
6318.3,They see someone who's scared or happy in a movie 
6321.87,and they feel scared or happy 
6323.4,in a way that seems like they're along for the ride 
6326.13,a little bit too much. 
6328.17,This is important because what it speaks to 
6330.54,is the ability for that... 
6332.16,"Remember way back at the beginning of the episode, "
6334.11,"that ACC, that anterior cingulate cortex and the insula. "
6338.31,We've got a prefrontal cortex 
6339.45,"that can say, hey, let's be rational. "
6342.39,"That movie, that person who's happy or sad, "
6345.12,"that person in your environment who's breaking down crying, "
6348.45,"yes, they're sad, it's important to be sympathetic, "
6350.88,"maybe even empathic towards them, "
6352.95,but let's not get pulled into the experience 
6354.93,so much that we lose ourselves. 
6356.7,And then of course there are areas of your brain 
6359.58,"that are also leaning on, and here I'm using metaphor, "
6364.2,"but they're leaning on the insula and ACC and saying, "
6367.77,"hey, there's somebody that I care about that's upset, "
6370.08,"I'm also going to be upset, "
6371.22,"or somebody I care about is happy, "
6372.45,"I'm also going to be happy, "
6373.74,or they're scared so I'm also going to be scared. 
6375.33,So it's a push-pull between our recognition 
6378.54,that we are each distinct entities 
6380.73,"and also, of course, the very healthy desire "
6383.16,to be attached to others' experiences 
6385.44,and the experiences around us. 
6387.21,"So why am I raising yet another continuum, right? "
6390.03,We already have the one continuum 
6391.95,of interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness. 
6395.43,"Well, if we want to think about how meditation "
6398.58,"can serve our mental health and our ability to focus, "
6403.77,there's a very particular mental model that we can arrive at 
6408.0,that incorporates this interoceptive-dissociative continuum. 
6412.38,"Again, if you are extremely interoceptive, "
6414.69,"you're feeling everything in your body, "
6417.81,and those feelings in your body 
6419.01,nearly completely account for all of your experience 
6421.41,if you're at that far end of the continuum. 
6423.48,"On the dissociative end of things, "
6425.73,"you can see what's going on, "
6427.56,"you can react to what's going on, "
6429.69,but your bodily response to that is essentially shut down. 
6433.26,"You could either be paralyzed shut down, "
6435.09,"so kind of no movement, "
6437.1,or you could still be engaging in behaviors 
6440.13,but you're dissociated. 
6441.66,"Again, sadly, this is often what victims of trauma report, "
6445.35,that they are able to just go through the motions 
6447.15,but just shut off their emotions 
6448.65,or their emotions just shut off. 
6450.48,They aren't feeling the elevated heart rate or breathing. 
6453.12,"Sometimes they can even be quite scared, "
6455.79,but they're not even perspiring 
6457.08,"or showing any signs of autonomic arousal, "
6459.54,"that is, fright or stress or panic. "
6463.32,So let's talk about this model 
6464.55,of interoception and dissociation 
6467.25,and then a meditative practice 
6469.5,that can be used to try and anchor us at the right location 
6473.01,or the healthy location along that continuum. 
6476.16,Let's first imagine the ideal mental health state. 
6480.03,"And here, I want to acknowledge, nobody achieves "
6483.54,or at least maintains this mental health state. 
6485.43,I want you to imagine that where you are 
6488.31,along this interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum 
6491.82,"is like a ball bearing, "
6493.26,or you represent a sphere 
6494.91,that can roll back and forth along the continuum. 
6497.28,"At one end, you have pure interoception, "
6499.29,you're just feeling everything. 
6500.43,"At the other end, you're completely dissociated. "
6502.65,"Well, in this one version of mental health, "
6505.95,we take that continuum and we fold up the sides 
6509.25,"so that it looks like a V, okay? "
6512.73,"On one end, you have interoception. "
6513.99,"On the other end, you have dissociation. "
6516.03,I realize a number of people are listening to this 
6517.257,and not watching this on YouTube 
6518.76,"so they can't see that my hands are now, "
6521.19,"the heel of my hands are together, "
6523.8,"the fingers of my hands are apart so it looks like a V, "
6526.26,and you are like a ball bearing. 
6527.82,Your state is like a ball bearing at the base of that. 
6530.359,You are in a trench 
6531.192,"of perfectly balanced interoception and dissociation, "
6535.32,"so you can feel things, "
6536.46,"you can register what's going on in the outside world, "
6539.13,but your feelings are not overwhelmed or overtaken 
6542.64,by what's happening in the outside world. 
6544.05,You are in a perfect place 
6545.22,of being able to make rational decisions 
6547.05,and yet still feel your feelings. 
6549.54,Wouldn't that be lovely? 
6550.98,Wouldn't that be lovely if we could be like that 
6552.45,whenever we wanted to? 
6553.62,"And frankly, nobody is like that all the time. "
6557.31,"More typically, the model of mental health and mood "
6560.94,and well-being and perception of self versus others 
6564.45,and internal versus external states 
6566.61,"is one of more of a U, a U shape, "
6570.3,"where at one end, we have interoception, "
6572.25,"and at the other end, we have dissociation, "
6573.9,"and it's kind of U shaped, "
6575.1,and your state is more or less like a ball bearing 
6579.93,at the base of that U 
6581.01,"that, you know, it gets pushed from side to side. "
6583.53,"Maybe, you know, your heart races a little bit "
6586.05,"because of something bad or good, "
6587.97,and that ball bearing shifts towards interoception 
6589.98,a little bit more and you notice that your heart is racing. 
6592.47,"Or perhaps, at any given moment, "
6595.86,"you know, your mind drifts a little bit "
6597.6,while watching a movie or while talking to your partner 
6600.72,or while your child is complaining about something 
6603.72,"and you're thinking about something else, "
6604.647,and that ball bearing shifts 
6605.79,towards the dissociative state a little bit. 
6607.89,That is a mild form of dissociation. 
6610.287,And I think most people would agree 
6611.76,that being mentally healthy 
6613.53,"would involve this kind of U-shaped model as well, "
6616.35,"where it kind of can shift back and forth, "
6618.51,but it's not extreme. 
6619.47,You're not going from interoceptive-biased 
6621.72,all the way to dissociated in any kind of extreme way. 
6624.99,The ball bearing stays down near the base of that U. 
6629.16,"Then, of course, there are states "
6630.39,"that we all, frankly, go into from time to time "
6633.9,where the continuum of interoception and dissociation 
6636.51,"is essentially flat, "
6638.52,"where you are a ball bearing at one location or another, "
6641.46,depending on whether or not you're watching a movie 
6643.59,that you're very engrossed in 
6644.97,or you're in a conversation with 
6646.44,"or in an activity with your partner or a friend, et cetera, "
6648.63,"that has you very engrossed, "
6650.34,"maybe matching their state, right? "
6652.2,There are a number of states you can imagine 
6653.31,"where matching one's state is actually healthy and good, "
6656.25,and then there are a number of conditions in life 
6658.05,and situations in life 
6658.92,where being matched to someone else's condition 
6660.75,like you're getting yelled at 
6661.77,"and they're angry so then you're getting angry, "
6663.39,"and then pretty soon, "
6664.47,"you know, you're not in the best place along that continuum. "
6668.58,"And I think that for many people, "
6669.99,they find themselves somewhere along that continuum. 
6672.66,"And a number of practices, including meditation, "
6676.95,"including exercise, including getting a good night's sleep, "
6680.01,"including therapy, including journaling, "
6683.25,including just doing activities 
6684.81,"like social engagement that you enjoy, "
6686.43,are designed to sort of bring up the edges 
6688.83,of that flat continuum into more of a U or concave shape 
6692.67,"so that that ball bearing, "
6693.84,meaning your state of awareness 
6697.56,and your state of feeling your own feelings 
6699.57,"versus paying attention to what's going on around you, "
6701.97,"is somewhere, again, biased toward the middle. "
6704.73,"By curling up the edges of that continuum on either end, "
6707.85,it biases that state toward the middle. 
6711.03,"And then, of course, there's the extreme "
6713.19,that I think almost everybody would agree 
6715.11,"is more or less pathologic, "
6717.3,which is one in which that continuum 
6719.91,"is no longer shaped like a deep trench like a V, "
6724.29,"it's not shaped like a U, "
6725.91,it's not flat with the edges curled up a little bit 
6728.22,or even flat. 
6729.053,It's actually now convex. 
6730.98,"It looks like a mountain shape, a peak, "
6733.17,and that little ball bearing at the top 
6734.85,can either drop all the way to one side 
6737.61,"of pure interoception, "
6739.29,just feeling beyond any ability 
6741.93,"to pay attention to anything else, "
6743.43,"just feeling one's feelings, "
6745.35,"being angry, being sad, or even happy, right? "
6749.07,Being so extremely happy or manic 
6751.59,that you can't pay attention to the fact 
6752.94,"that it's totally out of context, right, "
6754.89,"inappropriate for what's going on around you, "
6756.45,or dropping to the other side of the continuum 
6759.06,where you're so dissociated 
6760.71,that you're not engaged with what's going around you. 
6762.6,"You're truly, quote, unquote, checked out. "
6766.41,"That shape is one that I think almost all clinicians, "
6771.12,"if not all clinicians, "
6772.41,and most people would say is pathologic 
6774.6,because you are either completely checked out 
6777.99,or you are completely absorbed in what's going on 
6782.49,within you or around you. 
6785.34,That mental model that I just created 
6788.28,is a simple mental model. 
6789.54,"It is by no means exhaustive, "
6791.61,but it does incorporate a lot of what we think about 
6793.86,when we think about mental health 
6795.72,"and we talk about the ability to be mentally stable, "
6798.66,"to feel one's feelings, "
6799.83,but to still be actively engaged 
6801.66,in what's happening around us. 
6803.07,"And again, it's a continuum "
6804.81,that spans from interoceptive awareness to dissociation 
6808.65,where the extremes are pathologic 
6811.83,"and somewhere in the middle is healthier, "
6813.48,and then there are practices that bias us 
6816.84,toward being in the middle by default. 
6819.03,What are those practices? 
6820.14,"Well, we know for sure "
6822.42,"that being sleep deprived, for instance, "
6825.06,tends to take us away from that trench shape 
6829.32,or U-shape continuum or even flat continuum 
6832.47,and starts to make that continuum more convex. 
6834.99,It tends to make us either feel 
6836.73,like we're completely checked out and exhausted 
6839.34,"or that we are completely labile, "
6841.83,"we are yanked around by whatever experience is happening, "
6845.01,we are just not able to manage. 
6846.54,"So sleep is, as I always say, "
6848.76,the fundamental or foundational layer 
6850.86,"of mental health, physical health, and performance "
6852.69,because it tends to put us in a healthier place. 
6855.3,"That is, when we're getting "
6856.29,"enough quality sleep consistently, "
6858.45,it tends to put us in the middle of that continuum. 
6861.0,Sleep deprivation does exactly the opposite. 
6863.4,It pulls us apart. 
6864.51,"And when I say pulls us apart, that's not a real term. "
6866.67,What it does is it tends to make that continuum 
6869.79,"less concave, right, less bowl shaped, "
6872.52,"and more convex, more hill shaped, "
6876.57,if not a peak mountain shape 
6879.36,where it drops us to one side or the other. 
6882.54,"In addition, a meditative practice done regularly, "
6887.22,because it can allow us to become more interoceptively aware 
6891.54,"or it can allow us to become more exteroceptively aware, "
6895.44,"which is really just another form of dissociation, "
6898.95,"again, dissociation isn't always bad "
6901.23,"provided it's not at the extreme, "
6903.0,a meditative practice can actually teach us 
6906.57,to deliberately move along this continuum. 
6910.98,"So this is something, again, "
6912.69,that hasn't been discussed a whole lot in the literature. 
6915.21,"It's been discussed, I should say, "
6916.41,in pieces in different literatures. 
6918.51,"If you look in the clinical psychiatry literature, "
6921.24,there's a wonderful collection of studies and reviews 
6923.88,that will say that interoceptive awareness is terrific 
6926.79,except for the person 
6928.17,that is so aware of their internal functioning 
6930.18,that they are not able to engage in the world. 
6932.37,"Similarly, you'll find a beautiful literature, "
6935.07,"research and clinical literature, "
6936.3,that will say that dissociation is terrible 
6939.6,in the case of trauma. 
6940.98,"In fact, it can put people in positions "
6942.66,of repeating a behavior over and over 
6944.58,"that's damaging to them, "
6946.41,but because they can disengage 
6948.15,or they're dissociated from it 
6950.16,"that they continue the behavior, "
6952.44,or dissociation can be very adaptive and beneficial 
6956.88,"if it allows people, "
6958.14,"for instance, to create some narrative distancing "
6960.03,"so they're not getting pulled into every argument, "
6961.95,"or if someone screams at them, "
6963.57,they don't necessarily think that it's their fault. 
6966.0,"They are able to say, ""Hey, wait,"" "
6967.5,"you know, use their prefrontal cortex and say, "
6968.857,"""Hey, wait, like, just because you're upset "
6971.16,does not mean that I did something wrong. 
6973.08,"Let's look at the evidence rationally."" Okay? "
6976.59,So in thinking about the positive effects 
6980.04,"of meditation on mood, "
6981.99,there are two aspects that are important. 
6983.91,"The first one we talked about earlier, "
6985.29,which is being present to one's experience 
6988.62,correlates with increased happiness. 
6992.25,"Having your mind wander, "
6993.78,having your default mode network be one of mind wandering 
6997.62,actually is correlated with being more unhappy. 
7001.22,"That was the earlier study that we talked about, "
7003.74,"that study published in ""Science."" "
7005.87,"Now, of course, meditation can make us more present, "
7008.69,but if we do not pay attention 
7010.67,to whether or not we are becoming more present 
7012.68,"to interoception or exteroception, "
7015.95,"that is, to interoception or dissociation, "
7019.25,and we don't pay attention to whether or not our bias 
7022.07,"is one of dissociation versus interoception, "
7024.89,"we don't know where we are on the continuum, "
7027.56,"well, then the meditation "
7028.64,"actually can make things worse, not better. "
7033.2,"In other words, if you're somebody "
7034.22,"who has a tremendous amount of interoceptive awareness, "
7037.79,"well, then meditating on your internal state "
7040.19,"may not be good, "
7041.12,"and actually, there's some evidence "
7042.11,that it may actually be bad. 
7044.39,I'll give you one little tiny example. 
7046.07,"I've talked about this previously on the podcast, "
7048.14,but in that very study from Wendy Suzuki's lab 
7050.3,showing that 
13-minute-a-day,meditation 
7052.1,"is beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera, "
7054.8,it's also very clear that for a number of people 
7056.9,that do that typical third eye meditation 
7060.17,for 
13,"minutes a day, "
7061.49,if they do that too close to sleep 
7063.35,"or when they want to go to sleep, "
7064.61,"they have a hard time falling asleep, "
7066.35,which makes perfect sense 
7067.28,"because they are becoming more interoceptively aware, "
7069.71,they are ramping up their level of focus. 
7071.48,A meditation practice 
7072.98,"typically is a focus and refocus practice, "
7075.98,and falling asleep involves 
7077.42,turning off your thoughts and your focus 
7079.79,"and focusing purely on sensation, "
7082.37,and then your thoughts kind of fragment 
7083.99,and you drift off to sleep. 
7085.31,This is why I'm a big fan 
7086.27,of using non-sleep deep rest or yoga nidra. 
7089.17,We will provide links to non-sleep deep rest 
7091.4,and yoga nidra protocols. 
7092.42,"I've talked about them on the podcast before, "
7094.67,but those protocols are not meditation per se. 
7098.24,"They tend to have people defocus, "
7102.53,"they are anti-focus practices, "
7104.45,whereas meditation tends to be a focusing practice. 
7107.69,"Along those lines, a meditation practice "
7110.63,"that is one that is exteroceptively biased, "
7113.84,"where you focus on things that are outside your body, "
7117.32,can be wonderful for somebody 
7118.76,who tends to focus too much on their inner landscape 
7121.16,"and their inner narrative, et cetera, "
7122.39,"it can help get them out of their head and body, "
7125.0,which can be very beneficial. 
7126.8,"But for people that are not in touch with their emotions, "
7129.11,"aren't in touch with how they feel, "
7130.34,it actually can drive them down the exact path 
7132.77,that's wrong for them. 
7134.3,"So today's discussion is about meditation, "
7136.28,and we want to make sure 
7137.15,that we are parsing meditation in a rational way 
7139.76,that matches the neural circuitry involved 
7143.72,"and, more importantly, for sake of practical purposes, "
7147.17,that you are asking yourselves the right question. 
7149.75,Are you interoceptively or exteroceptively biased? 
7152.3,"Do you tend to dissociate, "
7153.38,or do you tend to sort of feel everything 
7157.19,"in a big way, right? "
7158.72,"I've heard this term of, you know, hypersensitive people "
7160.73,"or things that sort, "
7161.563,"and, you know, some of those are clinical terms, "
7163.16,some of them are not. 
7164.15,"But you need to assess this, "
7165.17,and you also need to assess 
7166.16,"where you happen to be at on a given day, "
7168.68,"which will be dictated, of course, by how well you slept, "
7171.5,"life experience, et cetera. "
7173.39,So this interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum 
7176.15,is one that you need to address 
7178.4,prior to any meditative practice. 
7180.86,"And, again, the solution or the answer of what to do "
7184.88,in response to your answer 
7187.79,of whether or not you are more inward focused 
7190.01,"or outward focused, again, is very simple. "
7192.38,Just do the opposite of where your bias lies. 
7195.14,"That is, if you're tilted towards interoception, "
7197.099,do an exteroceptive focused practice. 
7199.46,If you are more dissociative and you're... 
7202.52,"That sounds sort of pejorative, it sounds bad, right? "
7205.52,"But, again, if you are somebody "
7206.78,who is more focused on events outside your body 
7209.24,and you want to gain more interoceptive awareness 
7212.09,"and feeling state, if you will, "
7214.25,"well, then you want to do a practice "
7216.44,that's third eye center practice or breathing focused. 
7219.17,One of the reasons that many people meditate 
7221.66,is that they've heard before or they've experienced 
7224.54,that meditation can replace sleep 
7227.21,or can reduce one's overall sleep need. 
7231.68,"So that's an interesting set of questions, "
7233.3,and it's one that I dove into the literature 
7235.46,"to pursue an answer to, "
7236.747,and I came up with an answer 
7238.04,that was frankly a little bit complicated on the face of it 
7241.16,but boils down to some very simple protocols 
7243.26,that I think any and all of us can leverage 
7245.9,in order to sleep better 
7247.7,and maybe even reduce the total amount of sleep 
7250.37,"that we need, "
7251.203,something that I think most people would want. 
7253.58,"You know, I realize that we all "
7255.95,"probably should enjoy sleeping, I certainly do, "
7258.08,"but that it's hard to get enough sleep, "
7259.49,"and wouldn't it be wonderful, "
7260.51,"for instance, to be able to get by on a little less sleep "
7263.36,and still feel alert and rested? 
7266.84,"First of all, I want to point to the recent study, "
7269.21,"and, again, this is one that I've raised a few times "
7271.61,"and we'll post a link to it, "
7273.29,"entitled Brief, daily meditation enhances attention, memory, "
7277.4,"mood, and emotion regulation in non-experienced meditators. "
7280.79,"This is the work, again, from Wendy Suzuki "
7283.16,"who was a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast, "
7286.01,who is now the Dean of Arts and Sciences 
7289.07,at New York University 
7290.33,"and has run a laboratory focused on memory for a long time, "
7293.6,is a terrific neuroscientist and researcher 
7295.94,"and teacher, et cetera, "
7297.17,and was a terrific guest on the podcast. 
7299.51,I keep returning to this paper 
7300.65,"because they used so many measures, they were very thorough, "
7304.1,and the results were really interesting. 
7305.27,"Again, this is the "
13-minute-a-day,
7307.4,guided meditation session. 
7309.02,I should just mention that the control group in this study 
7312.71,listened to a podcast for 
13,minutes 
7314.69,"that did not improve attention, memory, mood, "
7319.22,"emotion regulation, et cetera, as much as meditation did, "
7323.27,which is not to say that podcasts aren't useful. 
7325.55,I won't mention which podcast they used. 
7327.32,"Fortunately, it was not the Huberman Lab podcast, "
7329.96,which I like to think at least increases understanding 
7332.48,of certain key concepts of science and science-based tools. 
7335.99,You're welcome to look at the paper 
7336.95,and see which podcast they used. 
7338.45,"It's a quite well-known podcast, "
7341.15,"which is an interesting podcast, "
7342.44,but it didn't change the brain in any fundamental way 
7345.17,in this 
13-minute,"session, "
7346.28,whereas 
13,minutes of daily meditation did. 
7348.68,"And, again, something I mentioned earlier "
7350.48,but very important to reemphasize now 
7352.73,is that they mentioned 
7354.08,that if people in the experiment 
7358.7,"meditated too close to bedtime, "
7360.68,"they had trouble sleeping, again, which makes sense "
7362.66,"because meditation, at least in its most common form, "
7365.21,"in the form used in this paper, "
7366.29,is a focusing and refocusing exercise. 
7368.9,Falling asleep involves focusing less. 
7371.57,"There are other studies, however, "
7373.82,"that have shown, or that asserted, rather, "
7376.49,that doing two 
20-minute,sessions per day of meditation 
7381.17,can reduce the need for sleep. 
7384.5,Those results are debated. 
7386.6,"First of all, understanding what sleep need is "
7390.2,"is very individual, "
7391.79,"and determining what people can manage on, "
7394.67,meaning some people can manage to get by 
7397.97,"with six hours of sleep but would do better with eight, "
7400.61,some people would actually manage probably better 
7403.85,in terms of focusing and alertness 
7405.2,if they slept a little bit less 
7406.34,because they might be waking up 
7407.51,midway through a sleep cycle. 
7408.95,"If you want to learn more about this, "
7410.45,you can check out any one of three different episodes 
7413.27,that we've done. 
7414.103,One is Master Your Sleep. 
7415.7,You can find that at hubermanlab.com. 
7417.2,Everything is timestamped in that episode. 
7418.97,The other is Perfect Your Sleep. 
7420.65,"And then, of course, we've done episodes on sleep "
7422.63,with expert guests like Dr. Matthew Walker from UC Berkeley. 
7425.84,"All of those can be found at hubermanlab.com in all formats, "
7428.63,they're all timestamped. 
7430.16,"With that said, this assertion that has been made "
7433.64,many times over and certainly in the popular press 
7435.71,that regular meditation can reduce one's overall sleep need 
7439.55,is controversial for the following reason. 
7442.52,"Some groups find that indeed that is the case, "
7445.31,and the interpretation is that the stress reduction 
7448.34,"that's brought about by regular meditative practice, "
7451.76,"and in this case, very regular, "
7452.96,"it tends to be one or, more typically, two "
20-minute-per-day,
7456.74,meditation sessions. 
7457.76,"That's quite a lot, I think, for most people. "
7459.869,"I mean, if you think about "
40,"minutes, "
7461.24,"isn't that much time overall, "
7463.55,"but very few people will stick to that twice a day, "
7466.19,
20-minute,meditation practice very consistently. 
7470.48,"Well, the idea is that the stress reduction, "
7472.67,"which is clear and not debated, "
7475.58,brought about by that type of meditation practice 
7480.05,is good at offsetting some of the cortisol increases 
7483.32,associated with reduced sleep 
7485.81,and leading people to be able to function 
7488.78,cognitively and physically better on reduced sleep 
7492.5,than they would 
7493.333,had they not been doing the meditation practice. 
7496.61,So the simple way of putting this 
7497.95,"is that if people meditate regularly, "
7500.66,that's reducing stress. 
7501.77,The reduction in stress is reducing cortisol. 
7504.59,"Again, cortisol is healthy, "
7505.73,but it should be restricted to early part of the day. 
7507.59,"You don't want too many peaks in cortisol, "
7509.03,especially not late in the day. 
7511.52,"By meditating, you get the healthy pattern "
7513.47,"of cortisol release, "
7515.39,you sort of inoculate yourself somewhat 
7517.61,"against the unhealthy pattern of cortisol release, "
7520.43,"and as a consequence, "
7522.44,either the sleep that people get is deeper 
7525.23,and/or the total amount of sleep that they need is reduced. 
7529.58,"Now, a lot of people took that result "
7531.47,"and interpreted it as saying, "
7532.85,"well, if you can't sleep, then you can just meditate. "
7536.39,"So one night, you don't sleep or you have trouble sleeping, "
7538.55,you just meditate the next day and you'll be fine. 
7541.37,"Well, certainly that is not supported by the literature. "
7543.44,"However, there is a practice, "
7545.72,"and, again, it's one that I've talked about "
7547.04,"on this podcast many times before, "
7548.54,"but if you haven't heard me talk about it, "
7549.74,"there's a practice called yoga nidra, "
7551.21,which literally means yoga sleep. 
7553.07,"It is a practice of doing not so much a focused meditation, "
7556.4,but more of a body scan 
7557.54,focusing on the sensation of the body 
7559.19,and actually trying to turn off that prefrontal cortex 
7562.31,or reduce its activity. 
7564.29,Yoga nidra scripts can be found on YouTube and elsewhere. 
7567.26,They are paralleled by a similar practice 
7569.24,that I've talked a lot about 
7570.2,"called NSDR, or non-sleep deep rest. "
7573.17,"I put one out into the world, "
7574.31,a short one that's 
10,minutes long. 
7575.9,You can just simply go to YouTube 
7577.16,"and put in NSDR and my last name, Huberman, "
7579.38,and there's one there. 
7580.213,"Again, all of this is completely zero-cost. "
7582.11,Yoga nidra and NSDR have been shown 
7585.98,"in a fair number of studies, "
7587.72,"not as many as been done on traditional meditation, "
7590.27,or I should say third eye centered meditation 
7592.7,"or mindfulness meditation, "
7594.41,but have been shown to replenish levels 
7596.6,of certain neuromodulators like dopamine 
7598.67,"and reduce cortisol, reduce a stress hormone "
7601.7,"at least as much and, by my read of the literature, "
7605.12,significantly more than with traditional meditation. 
7608.45,And there's a nice paper 
7609.5,that we will provide a link to which is entitled 
7612.02,Yoga nidra practice shows improvement in sleep 
7614.18,in patients with chronic insomnia: 
7616.19,A randomized control trial. 
7619.25,"Basically, this study looks at, as the title suggests, "
7623.15,"people with chronic insomnia, "
7624.92,although the results certainly carry over 
7627.05,or would carry over for people who don't have insomnia. 
7629.57,"The key result, I believe, in this paper, "
7632.99,"although there are many, is that, quote, "
7635.457,"""Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly "
7638.18,"after yoga nidra."" "
7639.53,What do I mean by that? 
7640.7,There was a statistically significant reduction 
7643.19,"in cortisol levels, the stress hormone, "
7645.56,immediately after the yoga nidra practice 
7649.58,that we believe would be paralleled 
7651.05,by a very similar if not equivalent practice of NSDR. 
7654.32,NSDR is a lot like yoga nidra 
7656.45,"but removes a lot of the kind of, "
7659.21,let's just call it the sort of mystical language 
7660.77,and the intentions. 
7661.603,It focuses more on the physiology and the body scans. 
7665.27,"You know, I want to acknowledge that yoga nidra "
7666.95,has been around for thousands of years 
7668.75,and was certainly there before NSDR. 
7670.91,"I also want to acknowledge that, "
7672.167,"and this was brought up also in ""Altered Traits,"" "
7675.2,that sometimes language can be a barrier 
7677.48,toward people embracing practices. 
7679.28,"In fact, this was recognized by Jon Kabat-Zinn "
7683.03,when he created what he called 
7686.06,"mindfulness-based stress reduction practices, or MBSR, "
7690.89,"which was simply mindfulness meditation to reduce stress, "
7693.35,"but he called it MBSR, mindfulness-based stress reduction, "
7697.85,as a way to bring it into the clinics 
7699.77,that would otherwise perhaps be averse 
7701.27,to something called mindfulness meditation. 
7702.95,"Again, this gets more to the sociology "
7704.69,and the cultural aspects 
7706.31,than it does to any specific utility 
7709.01,of one practice versus another. 
7711.32,Here's the takeaway point. 
7712.37,If you want to get better at falling and staying asleep 
7714.8,or falling back asleep 
7715.82,if you wake up in the middle of the night 
7718.34,"or if you are generally challenged with sleep issues, "
7721.73,an excellent behavioral practice 
7723.14,"for which there are terrific data, "
7725.18,"meaning data that show that a stress hormone, cortisol, "
7729.86,can be significantly reduced 
7731.09,as well as certain neurotransmitters can be replenished 
7734.9,"as well as, and this is key and covered in this paper "
7737.75,"that I've mentioned a few moments ago on yoga nidra, "
7740.9,that the total amount of sleep that you need 
7742.91,"can be reduced, at least somewhat, "
7745.28,"well, then yoga nidra or an NSDR practice "
7747.92,"done, frankly, any time of day is going to be beneficial. "
7752.93,"Whereas if your goal, I believe, "
7754.76,"is to increase your ability to focus, to improve your mood, "
7758.81,"and, perhaps most importantly, "
7761.0,to be able to maneuver yourself in a deliberate way 
7763.79,along that interoceptive-exteroceptive 
7766.85,or interoceptive-dissociative continuum 
7769.22,"that we've talked about so much, "
7770.66,and to really shift your default mode network 
7772.88,from one of being a mind wanderer 
7775.67,"to somebody who can focus and who frankly is happier, "
7779.0,"well, then a more traditional "
7780.29,third eye center type meditation 
7782.81,or a more traditional exteroceptive-focused meditation 
7787.01,would be beneficial. 
7788.27,"Again, which one of those you choose, either focusing inward "
7790.91,"or focusing on a point outside of you, "
7793.4,"again, should be dictated "
7794.33,by whether or not you tend to be interoceptively biased 
7796.82,or exteroceptively biased. 
7798.38,"But if you want to get better at sleeping, "
7800.57,"you want to get better at falling asleep, "
7802.49,"and you want to replace sleep that you've lost, "
7804.83,I put that in quotes 
7806.06,so that my colleagues like Matthew Walker 
7808.67,don't come after me with... 
7810.41,"What would you come after me with, Matt? "
7812.51,Probably with an alarm clock 
7813.65,"and, I don't know, blankets and a pillow "
7816.23,or something of that sort. 
7818.09,"In all seriousness, "
7820.85,it's very clear that replacing sleep that we've lost 
7823.52,"is an area of research that's still active and ongoing, "
7826.19,"but NSDR and yoga nidra are very promising, "
7828.74,"if not downright useful, "
7832.55,for replacing sleep that you've lost. 
7834.2,Certainly the small amount of data that exists now 
7836.9,"point to the fact that they are, "
7838.43,not the least of which is a beautiful study 
7840.02,published out of Scandinavia 
7841.76,showing that a 
30-minute,yoga nidra aka NSDR practice 
7845.57,"can replenish levels of dopamine, "
7848.18,which puts people in a position 
7850.52,"to be more action-oriented and focused, et cetera, "
7852.92,"when they come out of the yoga nidra, "
7854.15,so certainly a very useful practice. 
7856.31,"It's a form of meditation, we could call it meditation-ish, "
7859.88,but yoga nidra and NSDR 
7861.317,are not typically what people think about 
7863.42,when we talk about meditation. 
7864.56,"Of course, this is an episode about meditation. "
7866.36,The reason I bring up yoga nidra and NSDR 
7868.06,is that many people meditate to enhance their sleep ability 
7871.307,and to reduce their total amount of sleep need. 
7874.4,It appears that meditation is probably not ideal for that 
7877.19,"in comparison to yoga nidra and NSDR, "
7879.14,"but meditation is excellent, if not superb, "
7882.5,for adjusting the default mode network 
7884.36,toward more happiness by being more mindful and present 
7886.97,and for placing oneself in that healthy model 
7890.48,of interoceptive-dissociative continuum. 
7893.54,"So we've covered a lot of information, "
7895.34,and I like to think that I've given you 
7896.93,some key decisions to make 
7899.0,in developing a meditative practice. 
7901.4,"The most important one, of course, "
7902.45,being what will you do regularly? 
7904.7,And maybe you're somebody who just answers that question 
7906.56,"by saying, ""Look, I'm not going to meditate regularly. "
7908.57,I just want to do the thing 
7909.8,that's going to allow me to feel rested when I'm tired 
7912.2,and is going to allow me to adjust my state of mind 
7915.65,"when I'm not where I want to be for whatever reason, "
7918.47,"too anxious or too exhausted, et cetera."" "
7920.51,"And for those people, "
7921.343,I would say a practice like NSDR or yoga nidra 
7924.14,"will be immensely beneficial, "
7925.76,as will a more traditional form of meditation. 
7928.97,I also want to just remind everybody 
7931.07,"that an app that guides meditation, "
7933.77,"also with some information and some intention setting, "
7937.37,such as the Waking Up app from Sam Harris 
7939.83,can be immensely beneficial. 
7941.66,I've certainly found it to be beneficial. 
7943.07,"I know millions of other people have as well, "
7945.35,so I encourage you to check that out. 
7948.26,We've talked about determining where you are 
7950.48,on these continuums of interoception and exteroception 
7954.32,in order to dictate what particular type 
7957.05,"of meditation practice you should do in a given moment, "
7959.54,whether or not you should focus your vision 
7961.67,inward with eyes closed 
7962.81,or focus your vision and your attention outward 
7965.06,"being a key component, "
7966.02,"whether or not you should do cyclic breathing, "
7968.87,which will allow your focus to be off your breathing 
7972.41,"somewhat easier than if you do non-cyclic breathing, "
7974.78,"if you're doubling up on inhales or exhales, "
7976.76,whether or not your breathing is going to be natural or not. 
7979.07,"And, of course, you need to determine "
7980.63,whether or not your meditation practice 
7982.25,is designed to enhance your level of focus or to relax you. 
7985.19,I would say that if it's designed 
7986.9,"to enhance your level of focus, "
7988.85,that doesn't necessarily mean that it won't be relaxing. 
7992.0,You could do slow cadence breathing 
7993.077,"and third eye meditation, it could be very relaxing, "
7995.69,"and yet it's a focus and refocus practice, "
7998.27,whereas something like yoga nidra and NSDR 
8001.0,is going to be more along the lines 
8003.16,"of replenishing yourself, replacing sleep that you've lost, "
8006.97,or maybe even reducing your sleep need. 
8010.48,"On previous podcasts, I've talked about hypnosis, "
8013.03,"and particularly the episode with Dr. David Spiegel, "
8015.01,our associate chair of psychiatry. 
8016.63,"I don't want to get into hypnosis now, "
8018.04,but just understand that hypnosis is distinct 
8020.56,"from breathwork, from yoga nidra, from NSDR, "
8022.897,and from meditation 
8024.43,even though it includes some of those components 
8026.83,"like focusing your attention, "
8028.33,it involves actually directing your visual attention 
8030.49,"outward then inward to go into the hypnosis, "
8033.19,"it involves some breathing of a particular kind, "
8035.17,"it involves a specific imagery, et cetera. "
8037.72,But hypnosis is distinct because hypnosis is really designed 
8041.56,"to fix or address a specific problem, "
8045.13,"whereas meditation, NSDR, yoga nidra, et cetera, "
8048.28,typically are not. 
8049.96,They can help fix problems 
8052.27,"such as anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera, "
8054.4,but they generally are not directed 
8056.77,toward a particular line of thinking. 
8058.51,"They can be, but typically they are not. "
8060.58,"Whereas hypnosis almost always, "
8062.65,"especially in the clinical context, not stage hypnosis, "
8064.93,but the clinical context for which there's a lot of research 
8067.87,"to show it can, for instance, help with quitting smoking, "
8070.9,literally a quadrupling of the effectiveness 
8074.05,for smoking cessation with something like the Reveri app 
8076.93,than if people just try and go cold turkey 
8078.94,or for reducing insomnia or for reducing pain 
8083.05,"or for any number of things, including trauma, et cetera, "
8085.24,hypnosis is really great at dealing with specific issues 
8089.29,and problems and tackling those. 
8091.09,"Meditation tends to be focused on other things, "
8093.49,no pun intended. 
8094.72,I'm guessing some of you 
8095.553,are probably wondering where to start 
8097.75,"or, if you're already an avid meditator, "
8100.15,where to go with all this information. 
8102.34,"For that reason, "
8103.173,I just wanted to offer you a particular form of meditation 
8106.3,that incorporates all of the features 
8109.66,that I've talked about up until now 
8112.48,"in a single meditation practice, "
8114.7,and it's a meditation practice 
8117.4,"that, for lack of a better name, I called STB, "
8119.89,or Space-Time Bridging. 
8121.51,"And the time component has to do with a very simple fact, "
8124.6,"which is when we focus our attention, "
8127.66,"visual attention or otherwise, "
8129.25,"on things close to or within our body, "
8131.56,we tend to be fine slicing time. 
8133.63,You could sort of think of your breath 
8135.28,"as more or less the second hands on your clock of existence, "
8139.66,"whereas when we tend to focus on things far away from us, "
8142.87,we tend to parse or carve up time within bigger bins. 
8147.7,"If you've ever seen a airplane flying at a distance, "
8151.03,"it looks like it's moving very, very slowly. "
8152.56,"If you were right up next to that airplane, "
8154.0,it's probably going 
500,or 
600,"miles an hour, "
8155.65,it would go by very quickly. 
8157.33,This is not a coincidence. 
8158.8,"Believe it or not, how you slice the time domain "
8163.18,of your life and your experience 
8164.71,"has everything to do with your vision, "
8166.3,"and the closer things are, "
8168.22,the more finely you slice up time. 
8170.23,"The more closely your attention is placed on yourself, "
8172.48,the more closely you slice up time. 
8174.76,If you focus your visual attention very far 
8177.22,or you think about the other side 
8179.29,"of the world, for instance, and you envision that, "
8181.51,"well, then you're actually slicing time more broadly. "
8185.08,Hopefully that makes sense. 
8186.19,"Fine slicing would be like slow motion, higher frame rate. "
8189.85,"Looking in the distance, "
8190.75,you're actually taking bigger time bins. 
8192.46,"So even though things look like they're moving more slowly, "
8194.41,"it's because your fidelity, "
8196.09,your precision of measuring time is actually not as good. 
8199.813,It's as if you only have the hours hand on the clock 
8203.95,so it seems like it moves very slowly. 
8205.51,Hopefully that makes sense to you. 
8206.74,So there's a meditation practice 
8207.583,that I call Space-Time Bridging 
8209.35,that incorporates everything that I've talked about today. 
8211.78,"It balances interoception and exteroception, "
8214.0,"it balances interoception and dissociation, "
8216.4,and it crosses the various time domains 
8221.11,that the brain can encompass using vision. 
8224.2,"And it's a very simple meditation, "
8225.88,"it's one that I've been doing for years, "
8227.32,"and it's one that we're starting to do some research on, "
8229.267,but I'm just going to share with you 
8230.47,because I think it's actually quite fun 
8233.23,and can be quite informative. 
8234.88,"In fact, people have told me "
8236.23,that it can even lead to some interesting insights 
8238.51,both during the meditation and outside the meditation. 
8241.18,"It's very simple, what you do, "
8242.65,"ideally you would do this outside or at a window, "
8245.11,but what you do is you essentially close your eyes. 
8247.81,"I'm not going to do this now, "
8248.643,"I'm not going to close my eyes and do the meditation, "
8249.79,but I'll describe it. 
8250.623,You close your eyes and you focus your attention 
8252.28,"either on your third eye center or your breathing, "
8254.59,and you try and put 
100%,of your perceptual awareness 
8258.19,onto your breathing or your third eye center 
8260.83,"for the duration of three breaths, okay? "
8263.29,So you're 
100%,or trying to be 
100%,in interoception. 
8268.9,"Then you open your eyes, "
8270.43,you focus on the surface of your body someplace. 
8272.95,I find that holding out my hand at sort of arm's distance 
8276.1,and focusing on the palm of my hand 
8278.14,"and focusing there visually, "
8279.67,"so I'm splitting my attention now between my hand, "
8282.4,and I'm also going to pay attention to my breath 
8284.38,for the duration of three full inhales and exhales 
8287.8,"while also focusing on my hand, "
8290.2,so you're splitting interoception and exteroception 
8292.96,"as best you can, about "
50/,
50.,
8295.42,Then you subsequently look at some location 
8299.71,"in your immediate environment, maybe "
"10,",
15,"feet away, "
8303.43,and you focus your attention on that location 
8306.13,while also splitting your attention 
8307.75,"so that you're still paying attention to your breathing, "
8309.25,"you do that for the duration of three breaths, "
8311.56,but now you are in exteroception and interoception. 
8315.34,"Then you focus your attention at some distance further away, "
8318.58,maybe the furthest distance you can see. 
8320.17,"Now, this is why it's useful to do out of a window "
8322.75,or on a balcony or outdoors. 
8325.84,"You focus on the furthest point, maybe a horizon, "
8328.18,some furthest point for the duration of three breaths 
8330.88,"while also paying attention to your breathing, "
8333.34,and sort of imagine a bridge between the two 
8335.02,if you find it to be challenging to focus on both. 
8338.29,"And then, and this is where it can be a little tricky, "
8340.6,"but then what you actually focus on is the fact, "
8343.21,"and this is not an imaginary thing, "
8344.65,this is a fact that you are a tiny spec 
8347.05,"on this big ball that's floating out in space, right? "
8350.26,The Earth that's floating out in space. 
8351.85,And you try and focus on your three breaths 
8354.25,while also acknowledging 
8355.3,"that you are a small body, literally, "
8357.91,"on this very seemingly large body, the Earth, "
8360.61,"but that's floating in a much larger, larger, "
8363.28,"expansive place, the universe, "
8367.51,and you do that for three breaths. 
8369.55,And then you close your eyes 
8370.78,"and you go right back into interoception, "
8373.773,and you do that for three breaths. 
8375.04,You focus on your interoception for three breaths. 
8377.41,And you might want to march through these different locations 
8379.63,"a few times or back and forth if you like, "
8381.37,"but typically, I will just do it for one segment "
8384.7,"at pure interoception, "
8387.25,"palm of hand, some distance in front of me, horizon, "
8391.66,"whole globe, universe thing, back into body, et cetera. "
8395.2,Why is this useful? Why would this be useful? 
8398.2,"Is it at all interesting, or is this just some crazy idea? "
8401.08,"Well, the reason it's useful, I believe, "
8404.23,"is that it has you deliberately step your awareness, "
8408.94,your perception through every position 
8412.09,along that interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. 
8416.14,"Now, I did say to remain connected to, "
8419.2,"as they'll say in the yoga classes, "
8420.88,"aware of, I guess would be "
8422.5,"the more scientific way to state it, "
8424.6,"aware of one's breath, "
8425.65,"but if you wanted, "
8426.483,you could actually try and put your awareness 
8428.41,"completely outside yourself, "
8429.67,but most people will find that challenging to do 
8431.53,if they're already paying attention to their breath. 
8433.33,"It's just hard to do, "
8434.23,so I find it easier to just split my awareness 
8436.69,from interoception to exteroception. 
8439.0,But by stepping through these different locations 
8441.46,"and then deliberately placing your perception, "
8445.45,"your awareness back into pure interoception, "
8448.39,what you do is you essentially are practicing or exercising 
8452.74,this incredible ability that the human mind has 
8455.89,to deliberately place your perception at specific locations 
8459.91,along the interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. 
8463.27,And I think this is very useful 
8464.68,"because many of us, including myself, "
8466.54,tend to get locked at one location along that continuum. 
8469.51,"For instance, if you're scrolling your phone "
8470.95,"for a long period of time, "
8472.69,"you may forget about your bodily sensations, "
8474.37,but you generally forget about other things 
8476.02,going on in the world. 
8477.28,"Or if you're very focused on things out in the world, "
8479.14,you oftentimes can forget about your internal sensations 
8481.84,and what's going on internally. 
8484.03,"And being functional in work, in life, in relationship, "
8487.12,"and in all aspects, including your ability to fall asleep, "
8490.96,"involves stepping yourself along these different locations, "
8493.69,"which, again, are not just physical locations "
8496.33,of third eye center or your breathing 
8498.43,or your hand or horizon. 
8500.26,Those are just stations within space. 
8503.11,"But remember, each one of those, "
8505.33,just by way of how your visual system and the time domain 
8509.05,"are interlocked with one another, "
8511.78,sets your mind in a particular time domain. 
8514.36,And so much of what involves being a functional human being 
8518.08,involves dynamically adjusting our attention 
8521.44,from what we are doing on our computer 
8523.18,"to a question somebody asks and then back again, "
8525.52,or from text messaging 
8527.23,to listening to a lecture or a podcast 
8530.38,or from listening to a lecture or podcast 
8532.69,"and then going back into a mode of commuting, "
8535.24,but making that commute either relaxing 
8537.31,or maybe do work on your commute 
8538.69,"or connect with family or friends, et cetera. "
8541.03,So much of the fatigue of life 
8543.82,"and the, I should say, the maladaptive behaviors "
8547.9,and emotions that show up in life 
8549.73,are really not about any set of behaviors or emotions 
8553.9,"being wrong or right, "
8556.27,but rather inappropriately matched 
8558.28,"to the space-time domain that we're in, "
8559.99,"which, again, is just fancy nerd speak "
8561.58,for saying being present and being mindful 
8565.21,"is a wonderful byproduct of a meditation practice, "
8569.32,but it is but one of those stations 
8572.08,along that space-time continuum. 
8574.9,The key element here is to step yourself 
8577.3,through a practice deliberately 
8578.44,so that you are flexibly and dynamically able 
8581.53,"to engage in conversation, then disengage and focus, "
8584.53,or focus and then disengage from the work you're focusing on 
8587.2,and actually have a conversation or be in the world 
8590.11,and move out of that interoceptive awareness 
8592.9,to one in which you are dynamically engaged 
8595.63,with the things around you. 
8597.55,I realize this might sound a little bit vague. 
8599.5,"For that reason, "
8600.333,"I encourage you not to think about it too much, "
8602.77,"but rather to try the practice, see if it works for you. "
8605.5,"If it doesn't, that's fine. "
8607.66,I think it is a good one for people 
8609.07,that find that a third eye center 
8612.07,or breathing-focused interoceptive meditation 
8615.1,"might be enjoyable to them or very beneficial to them, "
8617.71,"but they might want to try something new, "
8619.18,and other people who might find 
8620.32,that that tends to put them too much in their own head. 
8623.05,I think it also ought to be very useful for people 
8625.75,"that tend to be overly exteroceptive, "
8628.54,"more on the dissociative end of the continuum, "
8630.79,"and need to bring in a bit more of interoceptive awareness, "
8634.33,but either can't do that or are uncomfortable doing that 
8637.87,because they're simply not interested in 
8639.82,or comfortable with feeling so much of their internal state 
8642.73,because that can either be overwhelming 
8644.17,or that's just simply not the way they want to feel. 
8646.3,"Now, as we round up, I do want to acknowledge "
8648.49,"that there are an enormous number of rooms within the house, "
8653.47,"or rather, I should say, "
8654.37,"within the castle that is meditation, "
8656.8,"including, for instance, intention setting and mantras "
8660.49,and an enormous number of different features 
8662.83,of meditation practices 
8664.03,that we simply did not have time to go into 
8667.06,and/or for which the research on 
8670.15,is not completely ironed out yet. 
8672.453,"And for that reason, "
8673.93,"in future episodes in not long from now, "
8676.24,I'm going to be sitting down with experts in meditation 
8678.73,"that include neuroscientists and clinicians, "
8680.71,but other experts in meditation 
8682.84,"that certainly are versed in those topics, "
8685.39,and where they can't point to specific research studies 
8688.84,can certainly point us toward the utility of things 
8692.02,like mantras and intentions as they relate 
8694.87,"to getting the most out of a meditative practice, "
8696.88,"so I eagerly await those conversations, "
8699.04,and I hope you will join me for those as well.
