0.833,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.28,where we discuss science 
3.477,and science based tools for everyday life. 
9.3,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.35,and I'm a professor of neurobiology 
11.94,and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.03,Today my guest is Dr. Charles Zuker. 
17.61,Dr. Zuker is a professor of biochemistry 
19.77,and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience 
22.38,at Columbia University School of Medicine. 
25.2,Dr. Zuker is one of the world's 
26.58,leading experts in perception. 
28.92,That is how the nervous system converts physical stimuli 
31.95,in the world into events within 
34.29,the nervous system that we come 
35.76,"to understand as our sense of smell, "
38.4,"our sense of taste, "
39.51,"our sense of vision, our sense of touch, "
41.64,and our sense of hearing. 
43.11,Dr. Zuker's lab 
44.04,is responsible for a tremendous amount 
45.81,of pioneering and groundbreaking work 
48.0,"in the area of perception, "
50.1,"for a long time his laboratory worked on vision, "
52.17,defining the very receptors that allow for the conversion 
55.32,of light into signals that the rest 
58.183,of the eye and the brain can understand. 
59.67,"In recent years, "
61.171,his laboratory is focused mainly on the perception of taste. 
63.57,And indeed his laboratory is responsible for discovering 
66.39,many of the taste receptors leading 
68.49,"to our perception of things like sweetness, "
71.07,"sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami. "
74.46,That is savoriness in food. 
76.71,Dr. Zuker's laboratory is also responsible 
78.69,for doing groundbreaking work on the sense of thirst. 
81.66,That is how the nervous system determines whether 
84.15,or not we should ingest more fluid 
86.16,or reject fluids that are offered to us. 
88.95,A key feature of the work from Dr. Zuker's laboratory 
91.65,is that it bridges the brain and body. 
94.17,As you'll soon learn from today's discussion. 
96.33,His laboratory has discovered a unique set of sugar sensing 
100.14,"neurons that exist not just within the brain, "
102.69,but a separate set of neurons. 
103.89,That sense sweetness and sugar within the body. 
106.92,And that much of the communication between the brain 
109.17,and body leading to our seeking of sugar 
111.84,is below our conscious detection. 
113.88,Dr. Zuker has received a large number of prestigious awards 
116.58,and appointments as a consequence 
117.87,of his discoveries in neuroscience. 
119.97,"He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, "
122.25,"the National Academy of Medicine, "
123.63,and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
126.33,He is also an investigator 
127.65,with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. 
129.87,For those of you that are not familiar 
131.34,"with the so-called HHMI, "
132.84,"the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, "
134.43,Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
135.48,investigators are selected 
137.07,on an extremely competitive basis. 
139.41,And indeed they have to come back every five years 
142.11,and prove themselves worthy 
143.97,"of being reappointed as Howard Hughes investigators, "
147.39,Dr. Zuker has been a Howard Hughes investigator since 
1989.,
152.01,What all that means for you as a viewer 
153.54,"and or listener of today's podcast, "
155.61,is that you are about to learn about the nervous system 
158.34,"and its ability to create perceptions in particular, "
160.95,the perception of taste and sugar sensing 
163.32,from the world's expert on perception and taste. 
167.04,"I'm certain that by the end of today's podcast, "
169.59,you're not just going to come away with a deeper 
171.15,understanding of our perceptions 
172.71,and our perception of taste in particular. 
174.9,But indeed you will come away with an understanding 
177.33,of how we create internal representations 
180.06,"of the entire world around us and in doing so, "
183.51,how we come to understand our life experience. 
186.24,I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast 
188.1,is now partnered with Momentous Supplements. 
190.41,We often talk about supplements on the Huberman Lab Podcast 
192.9,"and while supplements aren't necessary for everybody, "
195.12,many people derive tremendous benefit from them. 
197.25,For things like enhancing the quality and speed 
200.04,with which you get into sleep 
201.6,or for enhancing focus or for hormone support. 
204.6,The reason we partnered 
205.44,with Momentous Supplements is several fold. 
207.21,"First of all, their supplements are "
208.13,of the absolute highest quality. 
210.0,"Second of all, they ship internationally, "
212.25,which is important because many 
213.69,of our podcast listeners reside outside the US. 
216.36,"Third, many of the supplements "
218.04,that Momentous makes and most all 
219.95,of the supplements that we partnered 
221.37,with them directly on are single ingredient formulations. 
224.7,This is important for a number of reasons. 
226.2,"First of all, if you're going to create "
227.52,"a supplement protocol that's customized for your needs, "
230.31,you want to be able to figure out which supplement ingredients 
232.68,are most essential and only use those and supplements 
235.5,that combine lots of ingredients simply 
236.94,won't allow you to do that. 
238.5,So in trying to put together 
239.82,"a supplement protocol for yourself, "
241.56,that's the most biologically effective 
243.36,and cost effective single ingredient formulations 
246.03,are going to be the most useful. 
247.41,If you'd like to see the supplements that we partner 
249.12,"with Momentous on, you can go "
250.68,"to livemomentous.com/huberman, "
253.846,and there you'll see many of the supplements 
255.42,that we've talked repeatedly about 
256.86,on the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes. 
259.08,I should mention that the catalog of supplements 
261.57,that are available at livemomentous.com/Huberman 
264.18,is constantly being expanded. 
265.98,"So you can check back there, "
267.24,livemomentous.com/huberman to see 
269.91,what's currently available. 
271.08,"And from time to time, "
272.28,you'll notice new supplements being added to the inventory. 
274.86,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize "
276.54,that this podcast is separate 
277.86,from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
280.14,"It is however, part of my desire "
281.73,and effort to bring zero cost to consumer 
283.53,information about science and science related tools 
285.93,"to the general public in keeping with that theme, "
288.3,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
291.03,Our first sponsor is Thesis. 
293.01,Thesis makes custom nootropics 
295.26,"and for frequent listeners of this podcast, "
297.72,you may remember that I'm not a big fan of the word 
299.79,nootropics because the word nootropics 
302.13,means smart drugs or smart compound. 
305.1,And the reason I don't like that phrase is that the brain 
307.77,has many different circuits that it uses in order 
310.11,to perform things like focus 
312.36,or task switching or creativity. 
315.0,So the idea that there's a single thing that we would call 
317.64,a smart drug is simply not in concert with the biology. 
322.02,"Well, Thesis understands this, "
323.55,and as a consequence has developed custom nootropic 
326.37,formulations that are tailored to your unique needs. 
329.52,"So for instance, "
330.63,Thesis will allow you to try different blends over 
332.94,the course of a month and determine 
334.53,which blends of specific ingredients work best 
336.93,for you to focus or for you to gain motivation 
340.05,and energy for workouts or 
341.7,for cognitive work of some sort. 
343.29,I've been using Thesis custom nootropics 
344.91,for well over six months now. 
346.71,And they completely transform the way that I do cognitive 
349.26,"work and indeed the way that I do physical fitness, "
352.68,if you want to try your 
353.64,"own personalized nootropic starter kit, "
355.26,you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman. 
358.56,There you'll just do a brief 
359.73,three minute quiz and Thesis will 
361.44,send you four different formulas to try in your first month. 
364.26,That's takethesis.com/huberman 
366.39,and use the code Huberman at checkout 
367.781,to get 
10%,off your first box. 
370.17,Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. 
372.303,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses 
374.148,that are the absolute highest quality. 
376.44,The company was founded by two 
377.46,all American swimmers from Stanford 
379.02,and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses 
381.54,were designed with performance 
383.16,"in mind and with the biology of the visual system in mind, "
386.25,"I spent my lifetime working on the visual system, "
387.99,and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend 
390.18,with a number of very important challenges in order 
392.58,"to be able to see the world around you clearly, "
394.65,things like adjusting for background illumination so that 
396.96,"when you go from a sunny area to a shady area, "
398.88,you can see what's in front 
399.84,of you still with crystal clarity. 
401.76,ROKA takes all of that into account 
403.47,"when designing their eyeglasses and sunglasses, "
405.9,their eyeglasses and sunglasses 
407.1,"also have some unique qualities for instance, "
409.44,because they were initially designed 
411.0,for performance with things like running and cycling. 
413.73,"If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face. "
415.77,Also they're extremely lightweight. 
417.42,"In fact, most of the time, "
418.253,I don't even remember that I'm wearing them. 
420.09,I wear ROKA eyeglasses at night. 
422.16,So I wear readers and I wear sunglasses often 
424.5,"during the day, if it's very bright or if I'm driving, "
426.96,"if you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, "
429.12,you can go to ROKA that's roka.com and enter 
432.03,the code Huberman to save 
20%,off your first order. 
435.18,Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. 
437.67,Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows 
439.41,that are uniquely tailored to your sleep needs. 
442.08,I've talked repeatedly about the fact that sleep 
444.39,"is the foundation of mental health, "
445.77,"physical health, and performance. "
447.42,So getting adequate deep sleep is absolutely essential. 
450.63,"Now, one of the key things to getting "
451.77,a great night's sleep is to make sure 
452.94,that the surface that you're sleeping on 
454.65,is the right one for you. 
456.03,"Helix understands this, "
457.29,and they've created a sleep quiz. 
459.39,That is you go to their website and you fill out 
461.88,a brief quiz that asks questions 
463.56,"like you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach. "
465.63,Do you tend to run hotter cold during the night? 
467.16,Maybe you don't know the answers. 
468.15,"In which case you simply say you don't know, "
470.4,"by taking that quiz, "
471.36,they will match you to a mattress 
473.31,that is ideal for your sleep needs. 
475.62,"I took that quiz and I matched to the so-called Dusk, "
477.9,D-U-S-K mattress. 
479.19,"And I've been sleeping on that mattress for some time now, "
481.26,and it's the best sleep that I've ever had. 
483.0,"So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress to one, "
484.92,"that's uniquely tailored to your sleep needs, "
487.02,"you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman, "
488.956,"take their two minute sleep quiz, "
490.68,and they'll match you to a customized mattress. 
492.39,And you'll get up to $
200,off any mattress order 
495.3,and two free pillows. 
496.68,They have a 
10,year warranty and you get to try out 
498.63,"that mattress for a hundred nights, risk free. "
500.76,"They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it, "
502.59,but I do believe 
503.423,that you will love it because you'll be 
504.57,sleeping far better than you have before. 
506.52,"Again, if you're interested, "
507.72,you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman to get up to $
200,off 
511.8,and two free pillows. 
513.0,"And now for my discussion with Dr. Charles Zuker, "
516.18,"Charles, thank you so much for joining me today. "
518.607,- My pleasure. 
520.11,- I want to ask you about many things related 
522.45,"to taste and gustatory perception, "
525.72,but maybe to start off and because you've worked 
528.27,"on a number of different topics in neuroscience, "
530.28,"not just taste, "
532.56,"how do you think about perception, "
534.81,"or rather, I should say, "
535.95,"how should the world and people think about perception, "
540.3,how it's different from sensation and what leads 
544.32,"to our experience of life in terms of vision, "
547.56,"hearing, taste, et cetera? "
549.48,- So the brain is an extra ordinary organ 
557.708,that weights maybe 
2%,of your body mass. 
561.567,Yet it consumes anywhere between 
25,
565.387,to 
30%,of all of your energy and oxygen. 
572.822,And it gets transformed into a mind 
577.17,and this mind changes the human condition. 
580.765,"It make, it changes, it transforms fear into courage, "
589.02,"conformity into creativity, sadness into happiness. "
594.81,How the hell does that happen? 
599.04,"Now, the challenge that the brain faces "
602.64,is that the world is made of real things. 
605.94,"You know, this here is a glass, "
609.0,"and this is a cord and this is a microphone, "
612.12,but the brain is only made of neurons 
614.88,that only understand electrical signals. 
618.63,So how do you transform that reality into nothing 
624.45,that electrical signals that now need 
627.45,to represent the world? 
632.286,And that process 
634.32,"is what we can operationally define as perception, "
639.42,"in the senses, let's say olfactory, "
643.38,"other taste, vision we can very straightforwardly "
649.293,"separate detection from perception, "
652.41,"detection is what happens when you take a sugar molecule, "
655.53,you put it in your tongue and then a set of specific cells 
660.36,"now sense that sugar molecule that's detection, "
664.95,you haven't perceived anything yet. 
666.99,"That is just your cells in your tongue, "
670.271,interacting with this chemical. 
671.88,But now that cell gets activated and sends a signal 
674.81,to the brain and now detection 
677.25,gets transformed into perception. 
681.6,And he's trying to understand how that happens. 
685.08,"That's been the maniacal drive, "
691.89,of my entire career in neuroscience. 
694.861,How does the brain ultimately transform detection 
698.7,into perception so that it can guide actions and behaviors? 
704.31,Does that make sense? 
705.51,- Absolutely. 
706.56,"And is a very clear and beautiful description, "
710.31,a sort of high level question related to that. 
712.5,And then I think we can get 
713.88,into some of the intermediate steps. 
717.081,I think many people would like to know whether 
720.206,or not my perception of the color 
721.68,of your shirt is the same as your perception 
724.62,of the color of your shirt. 
726.472,- Excellent question. 
727.675,Am I okay to interrupt you 
729.472,as I'm guessing what you're going? 
731.988,- Interruption is welcome on this podcast. 
734.04,The audience will always penalize me 
736.26,"for interrupting you, "
738.078,and will never penalize you for interrupting me. 
739.47,"- Good, I like the one way penalize. "
744.302,"Now, given what I told you before "
748.96,that the brain is trying to represent 
750.84,the world based in nothing 
753.425,but the transformation of these signals into electrical 
759.42,languages that now neurons had to encode and decode. 
763.8,It follows that your brain is different than my brain. 
768.0,And therefore it follows that 
769.89,the way that you are perceiving the world must be different 
773.43,"than mine, even when receiving the same sensory cues. "
778.17,And I'll tell you about an experiment 
779.523,is a simple experiment yet brilliant. 
782.73,"That demonstrates why we perceive the world, "
786.18,how we perceive the world different. 
790.461,"So in the world of vision, as you know, "
794.85,well now we have three classes of photo receptor neurons 
799.35,"that sense three basic colors, red, blue, and green. "
807.42,"Blue, green, and red "
809.346,if we go from short to long wavelength 
812.273,and these three are sufficient to accommodate 
814.68,"the full visible spectra, "
817.53,"I'm going to take three light projectors, "
821.432,"and I'm going to project with one into a wide screen, "
824.55,"a red light, and the other one green light, "
827.97,I'm going to overlap the two beams. 
830.01,"And on the screen, there's be yellow. "
833.22,This is the superposition 
834.84,"when you have two beams of red and green, "
838.98,and then I'm going to take a third projector 
841.71,and I'm going to put a filter 
843.21,"that projects right next to that mixed beam, "
846.96,a spectral pure yellow. 
851.28,And I'm going to ask you to come to the red and green 
856.451,projectors and play with intensity knobs 
860.28,so that you can match that yellow 
862.62,that you're projecting to the spectrally pure next to it. 
867.21,Is this making sense? 
868.35,- Perfect sense. 
869.891,- And I'm going to write down the numbers 
871.32,in those two volume 
873.27,intensity knobs and then I'm going to ask 
878.481,the next person to do the same. 
879.84,And then I'm going to ask every person around 
882.48,"this area of Battery Park in New York to do the same, "
886.89,"and guess what, we're going to end up "
889.86,with thousands of different number combinations. 
893.19,- Amazing. 
894.3,"- So for all of us, "
895.59,"is yellow enough that we can use a common language, "
901.08,"but for every one of us, "
902.82,that yellow is going to be ever so slightly differently. 
908.25,And so I think that simple psychological experiment 
911.46,beautifully illustrates 
912.69,how we truly perceive the world differently. 
916.92,- I love that example. 
918.06,"And yet, in that example, "
919.95,we know the basic elements from which color is created. 
924.03,"If we migrate into a slightly different sense, "
927.18,"let me pick a hard one, like- "
930.06,"- Sound. - Sound, olfaction. "
932.593,- Very hard then to do an experiment 
936.001,that will allow us to get that degree 
939.45,"of granularity and beautiful causality, "
944.16,where we can show that A produces and leads to B. 
949.62,"If I give you the smell of a rose, "
951.27,you can describe it to me. 
954.3,"If I smell the same rose, I can describe it also, "
958.08,but I have no way whether 
959.97,"the two of us are experiencing the same, "
963.09,but it's close enough that we can both pretty much say 
968.46,that it has the following enough features 
972.653,"or other determinants, "
974.79,but no question that your experience is different than mine. 
981.806,- The fact that it's good enough for us to both survive 
985.38,that your perception of yellow 
986.61,and my perception of yellow at least up 
988.56,until now is good enough for us both to survive. 
990.96,- You got it. 
992.1,- Raises a thought 
993.3,about a statement made by a colleague 
996.09,"of ours, Marcus Meister at Caltech. "
999.48,"It's never been on this podcast, "
1000.8,"but in a review that I read by Marcus, at one point, "
1005.51,he said that the basic function of perception 
1008.36,is to divide our behavioral responses 
1011.0,into the outcomes downstream 
1015.41,of three basic emotional responses. 
1018.95,Yum. 
1020.06,I like it. 
1021.41,Yuck. 
1022.43,I hate it. 
1023.45,"Or meh, whatever. "
1026.48,"What do you think about, "
1027.41,I'm not looking to establish a debate 
1029.33,"between you and Marcus, without Marcus here. "
1031.07,- I understand that. 
1032.798,- But what I like about that is that it seems like 
1036.23,"we know the brain is a very economical organ in some sense, "
1040.25,despite its high metabolic demands and this variation 
1045.05,"in perception from one individual to the next, at once, "
1048.38,seems like a problem because 
1050.21,we're all literally seeing different things. 
1052.82,"And yet we function, "
1054.86,we function well enough for most of us to avoid death 
1058.7,and cliffs and eating poisons and so forth 
1062.6,and to enjoy some aspects of life one hopes. 
1065.63,"So is there a general statement that we can about the brain, "
1069.77,"not just as a organ to generate perception, "
1072.68,"not just as an organ to keep us alive, "
1074.96,but also an organ that is trying to batch 
1078.77,our behaviors into general categories of outcome? 
1081.62,"- I think so, but, and again, "
1083.75,"I think the world of Marcus too, "
1086.9,"and I think he's right that broadly speaking, "
1092.78,you could categorize a lot of behaviors falling 
1096.321,into those two categories 
1097.154,and that's 
100%,likely 
1100.01,to be the case for animals in the wild where 
1105.32,"the choices are not necessarily binary, "
1111.136,but they're very unique and distinct. 
1114.635,Do I want to eat this? 
1117.38,Do I want to kill that? 
1120.05,Do I want to go there? 
1121.22,Or do I want to go here? 
1124.91,We humans deviated from that world long ago. 
1131.54,And learned to experience life 
1137.81,where we do things that we should not be doing. 
1140.96,- Some of us more than others. 
1142.34,- Exactly. 
1144.07,"You know, in my own world of taste, "
1149.587,the likelihood that an animal 
1151.61,in the wild will enjoy eating something bitter 
1158.622,"it's inconceivable, yet we love tonic water. "
1165.71,"We enjoy, we like living on the edge. "
1169.52,We love enjoying experiences 
1174.74,that makes us human. 
1180.83,"And that goes beyond that simple set of categories, "
1187.307,"which is yummy, yukky, ah, who cares. "
1191.93,"And so I think it's not a bad palette, "
1194.21,but I think it's overly reductionist 
1199.91,for certainly what we humans do. 
1204.35,- I agree. 
1205.956,"And since we're here in New York, "
1206.789,"I can say that the many options, "
1210.322,"the extensive variety of food, "
1212.45,flora and fauna in New York explains 
1215.9,a lot of the more nuanced behaviors that we observe. 
1219.92,Let's talk about taste because although 
1223.55,"you've done extensive work in the field of vision, "
1225.83,and it's a topic that I love you could spend 
1229.31,all day on taste is fascinating. 
1232.46,"First of all, I'd like to know "
1233.6,why you migrated from studying vision to studying taste. 
1238.19,"And perhaps in that description, "
1239.54,you could highlight to us why we should think about 
1242.3,and how we should think about this sense of taste. 
1246.35,"- My goal has been to understand, "
1248.27,"as I highlighted before how the brain does its magic, "
1252.2,"you know what part you might wonder, ideally, "
1255.2,I like to help contribute to understand all of it. 
1260.24,You know how do you encode and decode emotions? 
1264.62,How do you encode and decode memories and actions? 
1268.85,How do you make decisions? 
1270.89,How do you transform detection into perception? 
1274.64,And the list goes on and on. 
1277.954,"But one of the key things in science, as you know, "
1284.03,is ensuring that you always ask the right question 
1287.33,so that you have a possibility of answering it. 
1293.0,Because if the question cannot be tractable or reduced 
1296.24,"to an experimental path that helps you resolve it, "
1300.47,"then we end up doing some really fun science, "
1303.62,but not necessarily answering 
1305.57,the important problem that we want to study. 
1309.77,Make sense? 
1311.048,"- From a first person perspective, yes. "
1314.36,"The hardest question, "
1316.527,the most important question is what are you going 
1319.13,to try and answer. 
1319.963,- You got it. 
1321.47,And so for example 
1322.43,I will have to understand the neural basis of empathy. 
1329.21,- [Andrew] There's a big market for that. 
1330.89,- 
"100%,",but I wouldn't even know. 
1333.734,"I mean, at the molecular level, that's what we do. "
1336.58,How do the circuits in your brain create that sense? 
1340.61,I have no clue how to do it. 
1343.43,"I can come up with ways to think about it, "
1345.23,but I like to understand what 
1347.96,in your brain makes someone a great philanthropist. 
1353.12,What is the neural basis of love? 
1357.11,I wouldn't even know where to begin. 
1360.38,So if I want to begin to study 
1362.09,"these questions about brain function, "
1364.97,"that can cover so many aspects of the brain, "
1368.81,I need to choose a problem that affords me that window. 
1373.94,But in a way that I can ask questions 
1375.74,that get me answers and among the senses 
1380.21,that have the capacity 
1384.016,of transforming detection into perception 
1387.216,"of being stored as memories or creating emotions, "
1391.04,of giving you different actions and perceptions 
1395.84,as a function of the internal state. 
1398.36,"You know, when you're hungry, "
1399.23,"things taste very differently that when you're sated, "
1402.71,"how, why? "
1405.113,"When you taste something, "
1406.1,you now remember this amazing meal 
1408.32,"you had with your first date, how does that happen? "
1413.18,So if I want to begin to explore all of these things 
1416.72,"that the brain does, "
1419.12,I felt I have to choose a sensory system that affords 
1425.135,some degree of simplicity in the way 
1430.595,that the input output relationships are put together. 
1434.99,And in a way that still can be used to ask every one 
1438.05,of these problems that the brain 
1440.03,"has to ultimately compute, encode and decode. "
1444.564,And what's remarkable 
1447.23,about the taste system at the time 
1448.763,that I began working on this 
1452.54,is that nothing was known 
1454.968,about the molecular basis of taste. 
1458.69,"You know, we knew that we could taste "
1460.61,what has been usually defined as 
1463.46,"the five basic taste qualities, sweet, sour, "
1467.99,"bitter, salty, and umami, "
1471.74,umami is a Japanese word 
1473.3,"that means yummy, delicious. "
1477.037,"And that's nearly every animal species, "
1479.84,the taste of amino acids. 
1482.18,"And in humans, it's mostly associated with the taste of MSG, "
1487.19,"monosodium glutamate, one amino acid in particular. "
1490.85,"- What are just by way of example, "
1492.65,some foods that are rich in the umami evoking stimulation? 
1497.6,"- Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese, eh, and it's a great, "
1503.51,great flavor enhancer. 
1506.48,It enriches our sensory experience. 
1510.05,And so the beautiful thing of the system 
1511.723,is that the lines of input are limited to five. 
1517.97,"You know, sweet, sour, bitter, salt and umami, "
1520.157,"and each of them has a predetermined meaning, "
1524.63,you are born liking sugar and disliking bitter. 
1529.49,You have no choice. 
1531.53,"These are hard wire systems, "
1535.01,but of course you can learn to dislike sugar 
1539.21,"and to like bitters, but in the while, "
1543.83,"let's take humans out of the question, "
1546.71,these are a hundred percent predetermined. 
1550.55,You are born with that specific valance value for each taste 
1557.45,"of sweet, umami and low salt are attractive taste qualities. "
1565.34,"They evoke appetitive responses, I want to consume them. "
1570.32,"And bitter and sour are innately, "
1574.88,predetermined to be aversive. 
1578.09,- Could I interrupt you just briefly 
1579.5,and ask a question about that exact point 
1583.405,for something to be appetitive to and some 
1587.591,"other taste to be aversive and for those to be hardwired, "
1590.57,can we assume that the sensation of very bitter 
1595.34,or of activation of bitter receptors 
1597.17,in the mouth activates a neural circuit 
1600.77,"that causes closing of the mouth, "
1603.35,retraction of the tongue and retraction of the body 
1606.5,and that the taste of something sweet 
1608.24,might actually induce more licking? 
1610.94,- 
"100%,","you got it, "
1613.31,the activation of the receptors in the tongue 
1616.85,that recognize sweet versus the ones 
1619.43,that recognize bitter activate 
1622.04,an entire behavioral program. 
1625.31,And that program that we can refer as appetitiveness 
1630.35,"or aversion it's composed of many different subroutines, "
1636.5,"in the case of bitter is very easy to actually look at, "
1640.82,see them happening in animals. 
1642.98,Because the first thing you do is you stop licking. 
1645.71,"Then you put unhappy face, "
1648.95,then you squint your eyes and then you start gagging. 
1653.84,And that entire thing happens by the activation 
1658.411,of a bitter molecule 
1659.779,in a bitter sensing cell in your tongue. 
1661.16,"- It's incredible. - It's again, "
1663.198,"the magic of the brain, "
1665.9,how it it's able to encode and decode these extraordinary 
1670.04,"actions and behaviors in response of nothing but a simple, "
1673.52,very unique sensory stimuli. 
1679.04,"Now, let me say that this pallet of five basic tastes "
1682.58,accommodates all the dietary needs of the organism. 
1686.03,Sweet to ensure that we get 
1687.167,"the right amount of energy, "
1692.12,"umami, to ensure that we get proteins "
1694.82,"and that essential nutrient, salt, "
1698.42,the three appetitive ones to ensure 
1699.77,"that we maintain our electrolyte balance, "
1703.85,bitter to prevent the ingestion 
1707.01,"of toxic nauseous chemicals, nearly all bitter tasting "
1710.175,"things out in the wild are bad for you, "
1714.26,"and sour, most likely to prevent ingestion "
1717.11,"of spoil acid, "
1721.28,fermented foods. 
1723.92,And that's it. 
1724.753,That is the pallet that we deal with. 
1728.27,"Now, of course, "
1729.103,"there's a difference between basic taste and flavor, "
1733.7,flavor is the whole experience. 
1735.86,Flavor is the combination of multiple tastes coming together 
1740.42,"together with smell, with texture, with temperature, "
1745.82,with the look of it that gives you what you 
1748.52,and I would call the full sensory experience. 
1751.46,"But, but we scientists need to reduce "
1754.67,the problem into its basic elements. 
1757.13,So we can begin to break it apart 
1759.92,before we put it back together. 
1761.81,"So when we think about the sense of taste, "
1765.17,and we try to figure out how these lines of information 
1769.22,go from your tongue to your brain 
1770.93,and how they signal and how they could integrate it 
1773.63,and how they trigger all these different behaviors. 
1776.6,"We look at them as individual qualities, "
1779.51,"so we give the animals sweet, "
1781.01,or we give them a bitter. 
1782.884,"We give them sour, "
1783.717,we avoid mixes because the first stage of 
1789.595,discovery is to have that clarity as to what you're trying 
1794.54,to extract so that you can hopefully meaningfully make 
1798.65,a difference by being able to figure out 
1802.19,"how easy that A goes to B to C and to D, "
1806.09,does this make sense? 
1806.923,"- Yeah, almost like the primary colors "
1808.67,to create the full array of the color spectrum. 
1811.4,- Exactly. 
1812.81,- Before I ask you about the first 
1815.03,"and second and third stages of taste and flavor perception, "
1818.69,is there any idea that there may be more than five? 
1823.244,"- There is, for example, what about fat? "
1827.15,- I love the taste. 
1828.811,"- Oh, I love fat too. "
1830.1,"And I love the texture of fat, "
1830.933,"especially if it's slightly burnt, "
1832.79,"like in South America, when I visited Buenos Aries, "
1836.27,"I found that at the end of a meal, they would take a steak, "
1838.79,"the trimming off the edge of the steak, burn it slightly, "
1842.72,and then serve it back to me. 
1844.13,And I thought that's disgusting. 
1846.38,And then I tasted it and it's delightful. 
1849.11,- It is. 
1849.943,- There's nothing quite like it. 
1851.69,- This goes back to this notion 
1853.28,before that we like to live on the edge. 
1856.43,And we like to do things 
1858.407,"that we should not be doing, Andrew, "
1860.57,"but on the other hand, look at those muscles. "
1866.54,- I don't suggest anyone eat pure fat. 
1868.85,"The listeners of this podcast will immediately, "
1870.5,I'm sure there'll be a YouTube video soon 
1872.27,that I like eating pure fat. 
1873.65,"I'm not on a ketogenic diet, et cetera, "
1878.16,but fat is tasty as evidenced by 
1881.66,the obesity problem that exists in this country. 
1884.487,- We'll talk about that. 
1885.649,"You know, in a little bit about "
1886.49,"the gut brain axis, "
1887.81,I think it'll be important to cover it 
1890.09,because it's the other side of the taste system. 
1894.985,"And so missing taste, one is fat, "
1898.64,although like you clearly highlighted a lot of fat taste 
1905.15,in quotation marks is really 
1907.49,the feeling of fat rolling on your tongue. 
1913.01,And so there is a compelling argument 
1917.81,"that a lot of what we call fat taste, "
1921.77,"it's really mechanosensory, "
1925.55,"it's somatosensory cells, "
1928.07,"cells that are not responding to taste, "
1930.8,but they're responding to mechanical stimulation 
1934.31,of fat molecules rolling on the tongue 
1937.07,that gives you that perception of fat. 
1940.43,"- I love the idea that there is a perception of fat, "
1943.1,regardless of whether or not 
1944.18,"there's a dedicated receptor for fat, "
1947.15,mostly because it's evoking sensations 
1950.19,and imagery of the taste of slightly burnt fat. 
1954.343,- For example. 
1955.176,And another one you could argue is metallic taste. 
1959.27,"You know, I know exactly what it tastes like. "
1962.3,"You know, if you ask me to explain it, "
1964.1,"I will have a hard time, "
1966.92,what are the palettes of that color 
1970.137,that can allow me to define it? 
1972.02,"It wouldn't be easy, "
1974.317,"but I know precisely what it tastes like, "
1978.272,"take take a penny, put it in your mouth "
1979.7,and you know what it tastes like. 
1982.323,- Or blood. - Or blood. 
1983.156,That's another very good example. 
1986.646,And is there really a receptor 
1988.7,for metallic taste or it's nothing 
1991.25,but this magical combination 
1993.26,"of the activation of the existing lines, "
1996.74,"think of it as lines of information, "
1998.39,"just separate lines, like the keys of a piano. "
2001.63,"Sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, "
2003.46,you play the key and you activate a one chord. 
2006.61,"And that one chord in the case of a piano leads to a note, "
2009.88,you know a tune and in the case 
2012.43,"of taste leads to an action and a behavior, "
2015.94,but you play many of them together. 
2017.65,And something emerges 
2018.91,that it's different than any one of the pieces. 
2025.772,"And it's possible that metallic, for example, "
2028.3,represents the combination of the activity just 
2031.3,in the right ratio makes of these other lines. 
2036.61,- Makes sense. 
2037.78,"And it actually provides a perfect, "
2040.256,your example of the piano provides 
2041.71,"a perfect segue for what I'd like to touch on next, "
2044.35,which is if you would describe the sequence 
2050.025,of neural events leading to a perceptual event of taste. 
2053.26,And I'm certain that somewhere in there you'll embed 
2057.37,an answer to the question of whether 
2060.54,or not we indeed have different taste receptors 
2062.62,distributed in different locations on our tongue. 
2066.19,Or elsewhere in the mouth. 
2067.57,- Yes. 
2068.56,So let's start by the banking 
2073.06,that old tale and myth. 
2076.12,- Who came up with that? 
2078.88,"- There are many views, "
2081.135,but the most prevalent is that there was an original drawing 
2085.96,describing the sensitivity 
2088.57,of the tongue to different tastes. 
2092.5,"So imagine I can take a Q-Tip, "
2095.56,"this is a thought experiment, "
2098.574,and I'm going to dip that Q-Tip in salt and in quinine 
2103.244,as something bitter and glucose as something sweet. 
2106.69,"And I'm going to take that Q-tip, "
2110.042,ask you to stick your tongue out 
2111.43,"and start moving around your tongue and ask you, "
2114.31,what do you feel? 
2117.73,And then I'm going to change the concentration 
2120.52,"of the amount of salt or the amount of bitter and ask, "
2125.23,can I get some sort of a map of sensitivity 
2128.978,to the different tastes? 
2132.483,And the argument that has emerged is that there 
2134.953,is a good likelihood that the data 
2138.1,was simply mistranslated as it was being drawn. 
2144.015,"And of course, that led to an entire industry. "
2146.65,"This is the way you maximize your wine experience, "
2151.57,because now we're going to form the vessel 
2155.35,that you're going to drink from 
2156.73,so that it acts maximally on the receptors which happen. 
2162.25,"Now, there is no tongue map. "
2166.84,"All right, we have taste buds distributed "
2169.81,in various parts of the tongue. 
2173.005,"So there is a map on the distribution of taste bud, "
2177.37,but each taste bud has around 
2178.99,a hundred taste receptor cells. 
2182.32,"And those taste receptor cells can be of five types, "
2187.87,"sweet, sour, bitter, salty, or umami. "
2191.08,"And for the most part, "
2195.13,all taste buds have the representation 
2198.22,of all five taste qualities. 
2201.16,Now there's no question that there is a slight bias 
2203.68,"for some taste, like bitter, "
2206.14,is particularly rich at the very back of your tongue. 
2211.06,"And there is a teleological basis for that, "
2213.34,actually a biological basis for that. 
2216.07,That's the last line of defense 
2217.87,before you swallow something bad. 
2221.68,And so let's make sure that the very back of your tongue 
2225.07,has plenty of these bad news receptors 
2229.48,"so that if they get activated, "
2231.37,you can trigger a gagging reflex 
2235.15,and get rid of this that otherwise may kill you. 
2239.08,- Makes good sense. 
2240.04,- But the notion that all sweet is 
2243.735,in the front and salt is on the side. 
2246.864,It's not real. 
2251.47,Go ahead. 
2252.303,"- Oh, I was just going to ask, first of all, "
2254.08,thank you for dispelling that myth. 
2256.39,And we will propagate 
2257.62,that information as far and wide as we can. 
2260.26,'Cause I think that's the number one myth related to taste. 
2263.38,"The other one is, "
2264.67,"are there taste receptors anywhere else in the mouth, "
2267.79,"for instance, on the lips? "
2269.907,"- The palette, the palette, not the lips. "
2271.505,"So it's in the pharynx at the very back of the oral cavity, "
2276.46,the tongue and the palette and the palette 
2279.31,is very rich in sweet receptors. 
2282.37,- I'll have to pay attention to this 
2283.51,the next time I eat something sweet. 
2285.67,"- When you pull it up, yeah. "
2287.53,Now the important thing is that 
2293.26,"after the receptors for these five, the detectors, "
2297.88,"the molecules that send sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, "
2302.26,"these are receptors, proteins found on the surface "
2305.35,of taste receptor cells that interact with these chemicals. 
2309.31,"And once they interact, "
2310.48,"then they trigger the cascade of events, biochemical events, "
2314.47,inside cell that now sends an electrical signal 
2317.92,"that says there is sweet here, or there is salt here. "
2323.11,Now having these receptors and my laboratory identify 
2326.53,"the receptors for all five basic taste classes, "
2329.65,"sweet, bitter, salt, umami, "
2331.18,and most recently sour. 
2334.15,Now completing the palette. 
2335.59,You can now use these receptors to really map 
2338.32,where are they found in the tongue in a very rigorous way. 
2342.7,This is no longer about using a Q-Tip 
2345.22,"and trying to figure out what you're feeling, "
2349.27,but rather what you have in your tongue. 
2354.23,This is not a guess. 
2355.503,This is now a physical map that says 
2359.38,the sweet receptors are found here. 
2362.5,The bitter are found here. 
2363.88,"And when you do that, you find that in fact, "
2365.98,every taste bud throughout your oral cavity 
2370.75,has receptors for all of the basic taste classes. 
2375.25,- Amazing. 
2376.48,"And as it turns out, "
2378.16,and I'm sure you'll tell us important in terms of thinking 
2380.62,"about how the brain computes, "
2383.17,encodes and decodes this thing we call taste. 
2386.2,I'm going to inject a quick question that I'm sure is on 
2388.93,many people's minds before we get back 
2390.97,"into the biological circuit, "
2392.86,"which is many people, including myself, "
2394.99,are familiar with the experience of drinking 
2396.7,"a sip of tea or coffee that is too hot, "
2400.39,and burning my tongue is the way I would describe it. 
2403.343,- Horrible. - Horrible. 
2404.97,And then disrupting my sense of taste 
2406.18,for some period of time afterward. 
2408.82,"When I experienced that phenomenon, "
2412.09,that unfortunate phenomenon have 
2415.212,"I destroyed taste receptors that regenerate, "
2418.06,or have I somehow used temperature 
2420.67,to distort the function of the circuit 
2422.59,so that I no longer taste the way I did before? 
2426.13,- Excellent question. 
2427.18,And the answer is both. 
2429.13,It turns out that your taste receptors 
2432.67,"only live for around two weeks, and this, by the way, "
2437.62,"makes sense because here you have an organ, the tongue, "
2443.35,that is continuously exposed to everything 
2446.65,"you could range from the nicest, "
2448.18,to the most horrible possible things. 
2450.25,- Use your imagination. 
2452.29,- And so you need to make sure 
2456.64,that these cells are always coming back 
2458.77,in a way that can reexperience the world 
2461.86,in the right way and there are other organs 
2464.98,that have the same underlying logic. 
2469.0,"Your gut, your intestines are the same way. "
2471.61,Amazing. 
2472.66,"Again, they're receiving everything that you ingest. "
2476.59,"God forbid what's there, from the spiciest "
2481.058,to the most horrible tastings or the most delicious. 
2485.86,"And again, "
2486.88,those intestinal cells whose role is to ultimately 
2491.2,take all these nutrients and bring them into the body. 
2494.98,"Also renew in a very, very fast cycle, "
2502.868,olfactory neurons in your nose is the example. 
2508.0,"So then A, yes, "
2509.83,you're burning a lot of your cells and is over for those. 
2514.72,"The good news is that they're going to come back, "
2517.51,"but we know that when you burn yourself with tea, "
2520.694,they come back within 
20,"minutes, "
2523.514,
30,"minutes, an hour, "
2525.04,and these cells are not renewing in that timeframe. 
2529.57,They're not listening to your needs. 
2531.55,They have their own internal clock. 
2535.24,"And so you are really affecting, "
2542.02,you're damaging them in a way that they can recover. 
2546.7,And then they come back 
2547.81,and you also damage your somatosensory cells. 
2550.42,"These are the results that feel things, not taste things. "
2556.342,"And then you wait half an hour or so, "
2559.81,"and then my goodness, thank God, it's back to normal. "
2564.55,"- And most of the time, "
2565.48,"I don't even notice the transition realizing, "
2568.157,"as you tell me, and I'll later, "
2571.36,I'll ask you about the relationship between odor and taste. 
2574.75,"But as a next step, along this circuit, "
2578.92,"let's assume I ingest some, let's keep it simple. "
2581.86,A sweet taste. 
2583.27,- Let's make it even simpler. 
2587.74,"But at the same time, perhaps more informative, "
2591.49,let's compare and contrast sweet and bitter 
2595.09,as we follow their lines from the tongue to the brain. 
2600.25,So the first thing is that 
2601.353,the two evoke diametrically opposed behaviors. 
2605.14,If we have to come up with two sensory experience 
2608.35,"that represent polar opposites, "
2609.94,it will be sweet and video. 
2611.35,There are not two colors that represent polar opposites 
2613.75,"because you could say black and white, "
2615.73,"they are polar opposites, "
2616.78,one detects only one thing. 
2619.046,"The other one detects everything, "
2620.62,but they don't evoke different behaviors. 
2624.97,- Even political parties have some overlap. 
2628.66,- Sweet and bitter are the two opposite ends 
2631.03,"of the sensory spectrum, "
2633.61,"now, a taste can be defined by two features. "
2640.355,"Again, I'm a reductionist, "
2642.61,so I'm reducing it in a way that I think 
2645.4,it's easier to follow the signal. 
2647.71,And the two features are its quality and its valance 
2653.05,and valance with a little V 
2656.2,"that's what we say in Spanish, with a V, "
2660.7,"means the value of that experience, right? "
2667.06,"Or in this case of that stimuli and you take sweet, "
2672.46,"sweet has a quality, an identity, "
2676.63,and that's what you and I will refer 
2678.43,to as the taste of sweet. 
2680.53,"We know exactly what it tastes like, "
2684.22,"But sweet also has a positive valance, "
2689.53,"which makes it incredibly attractive and appetitive, "
2693.31,"but it's attractive and appetitive, "
2695.41,as I'll tell you in a second independent 
2698.967,of its identity and quality. 
2700.81,"In fact, we have been able "
2701.89,to engineer animals where we completely 
2705.25,remove the valance from the stimuli. 
2708.19,"So these animals can taste sweet, "
2710.86,"can recognize it as sweet, "
2714.28,but it's no longer attractive. 
2716.71,It's just one more chemical stimuli. 
2720.49,And that's because the identity and the valence 
2724.39,are encoded in two separate parts of the brain. 
2728.65,"In the case of bitter, "
2730.99,"again, it has on the one hand its identity, "
2734.012,"its quality, and you know exactly what bitter tastes like. "
2738.88,"- I can taste it now, even as you describe it. "
2741.46,- But it also has a valence and that's 
2743.77,a negative valance because it evokes aversive behaviors. 
2750.1,Are we on? 
2750.933,- Absolutely. 
2751.81,And it comes to mind. 
2752.643,I remember telling some kids recently 
2754.12,that we're going to go get ice cream and it was interesting. 
2755.95,They looked up and they started smacking 
2758.311,"their like, they'll actually. "
2759.61,- The anticipatory response. 
2763.06,Absolutely. 
2764.86,When we talk about the gut brain maybe we'll get there. 
2767.92,"So then the signals, if we follow now, these two lines, "
2770.89,they're really like two separate keys 
2773.14,at the two ends of this keyboard. 
2776.71,And you press one key and you activate this cord. 
2781.21,So you activate the sweet cells throughout your oral cavity. 
2785.14,And they all converge into a group of sweet neurons 
2789.31,"in the next station, which is still outside the brain, "
2794.65,it's one of the taste ganglia. 
2798.16,These are the neurons that innervate your tongue 
2801.503,and the oral cavity. 
2802.6,- Where do they sit approximately? 
2804.13,- Around there. - Right here around there. 
2806.11,"The lymph nodes, more or less? "
2807.25,- You got it. 
2809.958,And there are two main ganglia that innervate 
2814.15,the vast majority of all taste buds in the oral cavity. 
2819.28,And then from there that sweet signal 
2822.58,goes onto the brain stem. 
2824.8,The brain stem is the entry of the body into the brain. 
2830.08,And there are different areas of the brain stem. 
2832.96,And there are different groups of neurons in the brain stem. 
2835.78,"And there's this unique area in a unique, "
2841.711,a topographically defined location in the rostral side 
2848.26,of the brain that receives all of the taste input. 
2852.7,- A very dense area of the brain. 
2854.513,- A very rich area of the brain. 
2857.8,Exactly. 
2859.03,"And from there, "
2860.508,the sweet signal goes to this other area 
2862.81,higher up on the brain stem. 
2866.95,And then it goes through a number of stations where 
2871.21,"that sweet signal goes from sweet neuron to sweet neuron, "
2875.44,"to sweet neuron, to eventually get to your cortex. "
2880.3,"And once it gets to your taste cortex, "
2883.18,that's where meaning is imposed into that signal. 
2888.58,"It's then, and only then this is what "
2893.11,the data suggests that now you 
2896.17,can identify this as a sweet stimuli. 
2900.76,- [Andrew] And how quickly does that all happen? 
2904.399,"- You know, the time scale of the nervous system it's fast. "
2909.832,- So within less than a second. 
2912.07,"- [Charles] Yeah, absolutely. "
2914.409,- I rarely mistake bitter for sweet. 
2916.48,"Maybe with respect to people and my own poor judgment, "
2919.48,but not with respect to taste. 
2923.11,"- And in fact, "
2924.803,we can demonstrate this because we can stick electrodes 
2926.83,"at each of these stations, conceptually, "
2930.007,"and we can stimulate the tongue, "
2931.96,and then we can record the signals pretty much 
2934.57,time log the stimulus delivery. 
2937.42,"You deliver the stimuli and within a fraction of a second, "
2941.5,"you see now the response in this following stations, "
2945.73,"now it gets to the cortex, "
2948.1,and now in there you impose meaning to that taste. 
2952.63,There is an area of your brain that represents 
2957.1,the taste of sweet in taste cortex 
2960.49,and a different area that represents the taste of bitter. 
2966.1,"In a sense, there is a topographic map "
2969.07,of these taste qualities inside your brain. 
2973.09,Now we're going to do a thought experiment. 
2976.27,"Now, if this group of neurons "
2977.95,in your cortex really represents 
2980.89,the sense of sweet and this added different group 
2984.34,"of neurons in your brain represents the taste, "
2989.32,"the perception of bitter, "
2992.417,then we should be able to do two things. 
2995.83,"First, I should be able to go into your brain, "
2998.77,"somehow silence those neurons, "
3003.0,find a way to prevent them from being activated. 
3009.216,"And I can give you all the sweet you want, "
3010.049,and you'll never know that you're tasting sweet. 
3014.19,"And conversely, I should be able to go into your brain, "
3018.3,come up with a way to activate those neurons 
3021.75,while I'm giving you absolutely nothing. 
3025.17,And you're going to think that you are getting 
3028.02,that full percept and that's precisely what we have done. 
3034.08,And that's precisely what you get. 
3036.75,This of course is in the brain of mice. 
3039.24,- But presumably in humans it would work similarly. 
3041.67,"- Absolutely the same, zero doubt. "
3044.19,I have no questions. 
3045.57,"So this attests to two important things, "
3050.1,"the first to the predetermined nature of the sense of taste, "
3055.56,because it means I can go to these parts 
3057.6,of your brain in the absence of any stimuli. 
3061.2,And have you throw the full behavioral experience. 
3066.12,"In fact, when we activate in your cortex, "
3068.43,"these bitter neurons, the animal can start gagging, "
3074.16,"but it's drinking only water, "
3078.39,but the animal thinks that's getting a bitter stimuli. 
3084.112,[audience applauds] This is amazing. 
3085.11,"- And so, and the second, "
3087.197,just to finish the line so 
3088.03,that it doesn't sound like it teaches two things 
3090.21,and then I only give you one lesson. 
3096.342,It is that it substantiates 
3100.372,"this capacity of the brain to segregate, "
3102.542,"to separate in this nodes of action, "
3106.17,the representation of these 
3107.88,two diametrically opposed percepts. 
3111.93,"Which is sweet, for example, versus bitter. "
3114.99,"- The reason I say amazing, "
3116.25,"and that is also amazing is the following, "
3120.51,"you told us earlier, and you're absolutely correct, "
3122.79,"of course, that the end of the day, "
3125.94,"whether or not it's one group of neurons over here, "
3127.86,"and another group of neurons over there, "
3130.35,"which is the way it turns out to be, "
3133.08,"electrical activity is the generic, "
3135.66,common language of both sets of neurons. 
3139.638,"So that raises the question for me, "
3140.471,of whether or not those separate sets of neurons 
3143.19,are connected to areas of the brain 
3144.96,that create this sense of valence or whether 
3148.59,"or not they're simply created connected, excuse me, "
3151.86,to sets of neurons that evoke distinct behaviors of moving 
3154.95,towards and inhaling more and licking or aversive are 
3157.95,we essentially interpreting our behavior 
3160.44,and our micro responses or are micro responses 
3164.1,and our behaviors the consequence of the percept? 
3166.38,"- Excellent, excellent question. "
3169.736,So first answer is they go into 
3174.895,"an area of the brain where valence is imposed, "
3180.24,and that area is known as the amygdala and the sweet neurons 
3185.34,go to a different area than the bitter neurons. 
3188.67,Now I want to do a thought experiment 
3190.56,because I think your audience might appreciate this. 
3192.75,Let's say I activate this group of neurons 
3196.59,and the animal increases licking 
3199.95,and I'm activating the sweet neurons. 
3202.08,And so that's expected because now it's tasting 
3205.5,this water as if it was sugar. 
3209.407,Now this Moses transforming water into wine 
3212.13,"in this case we're going to, and today's Passover, "
3214.29,"so this is an appropriate example, "
3218.7,we're transforming it into sweet. 
3224.614,But how do I know that activating them is evoking 
3228.36,"a positive feeling inside, a goodness, a satisfaction, "
3233.43,"or I love it versus I'm just increasing licking, "
3238.517,"which is the other option, "
3240.3,because all we're seeing is that the animal is leaking more. 
3242.79,And we're trying to infer that that means 
3245.67,that he's feeling something 
3246.87,"really good versus you know what, "
3248.94,that piano line is going back straight into the tongue. 
3251.73,And all it's doing is forcing it to move faster. 
3255.75,"Well, we can actually separate this "
3258.0,by doing experiments that allows 
3260.22,to fundamentally distinguish them 
3264.03,"and imagine the following experiment, "
3266.07,I'm going to take the animal and I'm going to 
3267.87,put them inside a box that has two sides. 
3272.73,And the two sides have features that make him different. 
3275.52,One has yellow little toys. 
3278.91,The other one has green toys. 
3281.34,One has little black stripes. 
3283.74,The other one has blue stripes. 
3285.33,"So the animal can tell the two halves, I take the mouse, "
3289.23,"put them inside this arena, this play arena. "
3293.61,And it will explore and potter 
3295.62,around both sides with equal frequency. 
3300.198,And now what I'm going to do 
3301.615,"is I'm going to activate these neurons, "
3303.63,"these sweet neurons, "
3306.06,every time the animal 
3307.14,is on the side with the yellow stripes. 
3316.051,"And if that is creating a positive internal state, "
3321.09,what would the animal now want to do? 
3324.06,It will want to stay on the side with the yellow stripes. 
3330.09,There's no licking here. 
3331.808,The animal is not extending its tongue 
3333.33,every time I'm activating this neurons. 
3336.36,This is known as a place preference test. 
3340.53,"And it's generally used, "
3342.37,it's just one form of many different tests to demonstrate 
3348.69,that the activation of a group 
3352.59,"of neurons in the brain is imposing, "
3355.62,"for example, a positive versus a negative valance. "
3359.79,Whereas if I do the same thing 
3361.56,"by activating the bitter neurons, "
3363.42,the animal will actively want now to stay away 
3366.75,from the side where these neurons are being activated. 
3372.36,- And that's precisely what you see. 
3374.33,- [Charles] And that's precisely what we see. 
3376.41,"- Many people, including myself, "
3377.88,are familiar with the experience 
3379.29,"of going to a restaurant, eating a variety of foods. "
3384.167,"And then fortunately doesn't happen that often, "
3385.26,but then feeling very sick. 
3387.6,I learned coming up in neuroscience 
3389.55,"that this is one strong example of one trial learning, "
3394.53,"that from that point on, "
3397.29,"it's not the restaurant or the waitress or waiter, "
3401.04,"or the date, "
3402.45,but it's my notion of it had to have been the shrimp 
3407.22,"that leads me to then want to avoid shrimp in every context, "
3410.28,maybe even shrimp powder. 
3412.05,- You got it. 
3412.95,- For a very long time. 
3414.39,I can imagine all the evolutionarily 
3416.79,adaptive reasons why this such a phenomenon would exist. 
3420.39,Do we have any concept of where in this pathway it exists? 
3424.049,"- We do, we know actually a significant amount "
3427.994,at a general level. 
3431.1,"In fact, more than shrimp, "
3432.84,"oysters are even a more dramatic example, "
3435.81,one bad oyster is all you need to be driven 
3440.13,that way for the next six months. 
3442.993,- I think because the texture alone is something 
3444.54,that one learns to overcome. 
3445.71,I actually really enjoy oysters. 
3447.63,"I despise mussels, despise shrimp, not the animal, "
3452.52,"but the taste and yet oysters, for some reason, "
3455.28,I've yet to have a bad experience. 
3456.93,"- It's like, uni, by the way "
3458.834,"texture is hard to get over, but once you get over, "
3462.15,it's delicious. 
3463.23,- That's what they tell me. 
3464.82,"We were both in San Diego at one point, "
3466.53,"and I'll give a plug to Sushi Ota, "
3468.72,"is kind of the famous place, "
3471.047,and they have amazing uni and I've tried it twice. 
3473.28,And I'm oh for two. 
3476.206,It somehow the texture outweighs 
3477.69,any kind of the deliciousness that people report. 
3480.585,- It's a very acquired taste. 
3482.1,"It's like beer, I grew up in Chile, "
3485.79,that's where the accent comes from in case anyone wonder. 
3489.96,"And by the time I came here to graduate school, "
3492.36,I was 
"19,",too old to overcome my heavy Chilian accent. 
3501.327,"So here I am, "
40,"years, "
50,"years late, "
3502.59,not quite 
40,plus- 
3503.979,- We appreciate it. 
3504.812,- And I still sound like I just came off the boat. 
3509.07,"So in Chile, you don't drink beer when you're young, "
3511.68,you drink wine. 
3512.82,Chili's a huge wine producer. 
3516.03,"So when I came to the US, "
3520.144,all of my classmates were drinking beer because 
3524.543,they had finished college where they were all 
3526.65,"you're drinking and graduate school, "
3529.56,you're working 
18,"hours a day every day, "
3532.89,"the way they relax, let's go and have some beers. "
3535.98,- And beer is cheaper. 
3537.06,"- And beer is cheap, "
3538.77,and we were being clearly underpaid may I add. 
3544.53,I couldn't do it. 
3545.67,It's an acquired taste. 
3547.53,It was too late by then. 
3549.57,And here I am 
60,plus. 
3552.63,"And if you take all the beer I've drank in my entire life, "
3556.11,I would say they add to less than 
3559.643,an eight ounce glass of water. 
3561.39,- Impressive. 
3562.223,"Well, your health is probably better for it. "
3564.0,- I'm not sure. 
3566.01,- Your physical health anyway. 
3567.3,- So it goes back to acquired taste. 
3570.54,This is the connection to uni and to oysters. 
3574.912,"Now, going back to the one trial learning "
3576.57,"this is the great thing about our brains, "
3578.85,certain things we need to repeat 
3580.5,"a hundred times to learn them, hello operator. "
3584.552,"Can I have the phone number for sushi Ota, please? "
3587.19,"And then she'll give it to you over the phone, "
3589.47,at least in the old days. 
3591.27,And then you need to repeat it to yourself over 
3594.42,"and over and over, over the next minute. "
3596.894,"So you can dial sushi Ota, "
3599.07,"and five minutes later, it's gone. "
3603.15,That's what we call working memory. 
3606.57,Then there is the short term memory. 
3608.52,We park our car. 
3610.65,"And if we're lucky, by the end of the day, "
3612.21,we remember where it is. 
3615.06,And then there is the long term memory. 
3616.74,We remember the birthdays of every one 
3618.66,of our children for the rest of our lives. 
3622.68,"Well, there are events that a single event is so traumatic "
3628.17,that it activates the circuits in a way 
3630.453,that it's a one trial learning. 
3633.0,And the taste system is literally 
3636.48,at the top of that food chain. 
3639.3,And there is a phenomenon known 
3642.73,as conditioned taste aversion. 
3644.46,"You can pair an attractive stimuli with a really bad one, "
3653.011,and you can make an animal begin 
3655.35,"to vehemently dislike for example, sugar. "
3660.03,And that's because you've conditioned the animals 
3663.0,to now be averse to these otherwise nice taste 
3668.52,because it's been associated with malaise. 
3671.7,"And when you do that, "
3672.72,now you could begin to ask why has change in the signal 
3677.46,as it travels from the tongue 
3679.5,to the brain in a normal animal 
3682.65,versus an animal where you have now transformed sweet 
3686.16,from being attractive to being immersive. 
3688.92,And this is the way now you begin to explore 
3691.56,"how the brain changes, the nature, the quality, "
3696.48,the meaning of a stimuli as a function of its state. 
3703.71,"- I have a number of questions related to that, "
3708.06,"all of which relate to this idea of context, "
3712.68,because you mentioned before that flavor is distinct 
3714.93,"from taste because flavor involves smell, "
3716.79,"texture, temperature, and some other features, "
3719.305,"uni, sea urchin being a good example of, "
3723.63,I can sense the texture. 
3725.34,"It actually it's, nah, I won't describe "
3727.44,"what it reminds me of, for various reasons. "
3732.75,"The ability to place context into, "
3735.48,"to insert context into a perception, "
3737.55,or rather to insert a perception 
3739.59,into context is so powerful. 
3744.344,And there's an element of kind of mystery about it. 
3747.3,But if we start to think about some of the more nuance 
3750.81,"that we like to live at the edge, as you say, "
3755.22,how many different tastes on the taste dial 
3759.39,"to go back to your analogy earlier, the color dial, "
3761.7,do you think that there could be for something 
3763.5,"as fixed as bitter, so for instance, "
3766.53,"I don't think I like bitter taste, "
3769.44,but I like some fermented foods that seem to have a little 
3772.65,bit of sour and have a little bit 
3773.97,of that briny flavor. 
3776.7,How much plasticity do you think there is there 
3778.62,"and in particular across the lifespan, "
3781.05,because I think one of the most salient examples 
3783.0,"of this is that kids don't seem to like certain vegetables, "
3787.56,but they all are hardwired to like sweet tastes. 
3791.25,And yet you could also imagine that one of the reasons 
3793.8,why they may eventually grow to incorporate vegetables is 
3797.79,because of some knowledge that vegetables might be- 
3800.01,- Good for you. - Better for them. 
3802.823,"So is there a change in the receptors, the distribution, "
3806.43,"the number, the sensitivity, et cetera, "
3808.17,that can explain the transition 
3810.24,"from wanting to avoid vegetables, "
3812.19,to being willing to eat vegetables 
3814.924,simply in childhood to early development. 
3817.5,"Yes, so I going to take the question slightly differently, "
3820.076,but I think it would illustrate the point. 
3821.88,And I want to just 
3824.565,use the difference between the olfactory system 
3828.66,"and the taste system to make the point, "
3832.41,"taste system five basic pallets, "
3834.75,"sweet, sour, bitter, salt, umami, "
3836.4,each of them has a predetermined identity. 
3838.71,We know exactly what and valence. 
3841.159,These are attractive. 
3842.73,These are aversive. 
3844.5,"In the olfactory system, "
3845.82,it's claimed that we can smell millions 
3847.89,"of different odors, yet for the most part, "
3854.07,"none of them have an innate predetermined meaning, "
3859.222,"in olfactory system, "
3861.99,meaning is imposed by learning and experience. 
3866.13,- Even the smell of smoke? 
3868.268,"- So I'm going to give you, "
3869.101,I'm going to make it differently. 
3870.63,They are a handful of the millions 
3873.93,"of odors that were claimed that, "
3876.543,that you could immediately tell me these 
3879.06,are adversive and these are attractive. 
3881.769,- Vomit. 
3883.393,"- So vomit, it's not correct "
3886.726,because I can assure you that they're 
3888.78,cultures and societies where things which are far less 
3892.68,appealing than vomit do not evoke a adverse reaction. 
3896.875,- Really? 
3897.866,"- Really, sulfur would be maybe a universal. "
3900.12,I'm not talking pheromones. 
3902.571,pheromones are in a different category 
3904.231,"that trigger innate responses, "
3906.66,but nearly every other is afforded meaning 
3912.48,by learning and experience. 
3914.28,And that's why you like broccoli. 
3916.56,And I despise broccoli because I remember 
3919.44,my mother forcing me to eat broccoli. 
3923.132,[audience applauds] I'm so sorry. 
3924.073,- Same sensory experience. 
3928.08,This accommodates two important things. 
3931.745,"In the case of taste, "
3933.373,"you have neurons at every station that are for sweet, "
3935.19,"for sour, for bitter, for salty, and umami, "
3937.65,it's only five classes. 
3938.91,So it's not going to take a lot of your brain. 
3941.13,"If we can, in fact, smell a million others, "
3944.1,"and everyone else of others had to have predetermined, "
3946.5,meaning there's not going to be enough brain 
3949.083,just to accommodate that one sense. 
3953.76,"And so evolution in its infinite wisdom, "
3958.44,evolved a system where you put together 
3963.395,"a pathway and a cortex, olfactory cortex, "
3966.407,where you have the capacity to associate every other 
3973.8,in a specific context that now gives it the meaning. 
3979.32,Now let's go back to the original question then. 
3983.85,"So other than clearly plastic, mega plastic, "
3988.2,"because it's fundamental basis and neural organization, "
3993.72,"but taste, "
3994.553,"we just told you that predetermined, hardwired, "
3997.38,"but predetermined, hardwired doesn't mean "
3999.667,that it's not modulated by learning or experience. 
4003.38,It only means that you are born liking sweet 
4007.64,and disliking bitter. 
4010.67,"And we have many examples of plasticity, "
4014.06,beer being one example. 
4016.25,So why do we learn to love beer and coffee. 
4020.0,It's because it has an associated gain to the system 
4027.35,"and that gain to the system, that positive valance "
4031.46,that emerges out of that negative signal 
4034.43,is sufficient to create that positive association. 
4039.23,"And in the case of beer, of course, it's alcohol. "
4042.74,The feeling good that we get after 
4045.23,"is more than sufficient to say, I want to have more of this. "
4050.348,"And in the case of coffee, of course, "
4051.35,is caffeine activating a whole group of neurotransmitter 
4054.44,systems that give you that high associated with coffee. 
4059.39,"So yes, this taste system is changeable. "
4062.841,"It's malleable, and it's subject subjected "
4065.179,to learning and experience. 
4067.951,But I like the olfactory system is restricted 
4071.57,in what you could do with it 
4073.22,because its goal is to allow you 
4077.12,to get nutrients and survive. 
4079.58,The goal of the olfactory system is very different. 
4082.64,"It's being used, not in our case, "
4084.77,but in every animal species 
4087.603,"to identify friend versus foe, "
4091.598,"to identify mate, "
4095.258,to identify ecological niches they want to be in. 
4098.87,So it plays a very broad role that then requires 
4104.39,that it be set up organized 
4106.82,and function in a very different type of context. 
4110.6,"Taste is about, can we get the nutrients we need to survive? "
4115.16,And can we ensure that we are attracted to the ones we need? 
4118.79,"And we adverse to the ones that are going to kill us, "
4122.42,I'm being overly simplistic and reductionist. 
4126.031,But I think it illustrates the huge difference 
4127.34,between these two chemo sensory systems. 
4130.64,- I don't think you're being overly simplicity. 
4133.01,I think it illustrates 
4134.657,the key intractable nature of this system 
4138.017,and the way you've approached it. 
4140.154,"And I think it's important for people to hear that, "
4141.89,"because everybody, "
4142.91,"as we are as mystified with empathy and love, et cetera. "
4147.44,"So in a fairness to that, "
4149.3,I'm going to ask a sort of 
4151.824,a high level question or abstract question. 
4155.24,This was based on a conversation I had 
4156.92,with a former girlfriend 
4158.54,where we were talking about chemistry between individuals. 
4162.26,Very complicated topic on the one hand. 
4166.22,"But on the other hand, quite simple in that certain people, "
4171.11,"for whatever reason, evoke a tremendous sense of arousal, "
4175.01,"for lack of a better word, between two people, "
4177.86,"one would hope, "
4180.83,at least for some period of time. 
4182.96,- I didn't know this was that kind of a podcast. 
4185.03,"- No, well, the reason I, "
4187.31,"but this has to do with taste because she said something, "
4189.92,"I think in part to maybe irritate me a bit, "
4194.18,but we were commenting not 
4196.52,"about our own experience of each other, "
4200.234,but of someone that she was now very excited 
4202.52,about we're on good terms. 
4205.82,"And she said, ""What do you think it is, "
4208.82,"this thing of chemistry?"" "
4210.17,So maybe she was trying to- 
4212.21,- Warn you of what's coming. 
4213.83,- Warn me what's coming. 
4215.15,"And she said, "
4216.943,"""I have a feeling something about it is in smell "
4220.34,"and something about it is actually in taste, "
4223.37,"literally the taste of somebody's breath."" "
4225.59,That's the way she described it. 
4227.643,And I thought that it was a very interesting example 
4231.05,"for a number of reasons, but in particular, "
4233.63,because it gets to the merging of odor and taste. 
4237.38,But also to the idea that of course the context 
4240.95,"of a new relationship, I'm assuming that, and in fact, "
4243.86,"they're both attractive people, et cetera. "
4245.54,"There's a whole context there, "
4246.71,but I've had the experience of the odor 
4252.26,of somebody's breath being aversive. 
4253.7,Not because I could identify it as aversive. 
4257.3,- Because you just didn't like it. 
4259.064,- But because I just didn't like it. 
4261.2,- But that's because you associated 
4264.59,with added odors that trigger 
4270.65,"that negative aversive reaction, by the way. "
4276.14,- Absolutely. 
4277.807,There are certain perfumes to me that are aversive. 
4278.99,- [Charles] You got it. 
4280.893,"- And there are other sense, "
4282.483,"I can recall a sense of skin, of foods, "
4285.68,"et cetera, that are immensely appetitive. "
4288.29,So I've experienced both sides of this equation myself. 
4291.47,And she was describing this 
4292.88,"and to me more than tasting wine, "
4295.7,which is the typical example 
4297.2,"where people inhale it and then they drink it, to me, "
4299.72,this seems like something 
4302.61,"that more people might be able to relate to, "
4305.123,that certain things and people smell delicious. 
4307.52,Even mothers describing the smell of their baby's head. 
4309.86,"- A mother, or us. "
4310.91,"- [Andrew] Of course, men too, yeah. "
4313.38,"- I mean our own babies when in their necks, "
4315.35,that's the magical place. 
4316.85,- Their neck. 
4318.289,- The back of their neck. 
4319.397,- There you go. - Oh my goodness. 
4320.54,I have a grandchild now. 
4321.56,"So I know exactly what, Rio, that's his name, smells like. "
4325.49,- Okay. 
4326.75,So more beautiful examples. 
4327.583,It's always more fun to think 
4329.024,about the beautiful positively appetitive examples. 
4331.58,The smell of the back of your grandson's neck. 
4335.54,"I mean, you could get more specific than that, "
4338.957,but not a lot more specific exactly. 
4340.46,So what is going on in terms of the combination of odor 
4344.03,and taste given that these two systems are so different? 
4347.63,"- Yes, and they come together, "
4352.61,ultimately there is a place in the brain where they come 
4356.57,together to integrate the two into 
4360.32,what we would call that sensory experience. 
4365.24,And I'll tell you an experiment 
4366.62,that you could do that demonstrates this. 
4370.239,"I think it's good for the, "
4372.494,for your audience here to get a sense of how we approach 
4375.32,these problems so that we can get 
4377.21,in a meaningful scientific answers. 
4381.659,So we know where the olfactory cortex is in the brain. 
4385.13,We know where the taste cortex is in the brain. 
4387.08,They're in two different places. 
4389.21,"We can go to each of these two, cortexes, "
4393.77,"put color traces, we put green in one, "
4397.52,we put red in the other and we see where the colors go to. 
4401.96,That's a reflection of where 
4405.263,those neurons are projecting into their next targets. 
4409.16,"Once they get the signal, where do they send the signal to? "
4413.27,And then we reason that if odor 
4416.24,"and taste come together somewhere in the brain, "
4418.97,we should find an area that now 
4420.59,it's getting red and green color. 
4424.19,And we found such an area. 
4427.61,"And next we anticipated, "
4429.89,we hypothesized that maybe this is the area 
4433.07,"in the brain of the mouse, "
4435.26,"corresponding area in the brain of humans, "
4438.907,that integrates odor and taste. 
4443.09,"It's known as, "
4444.5,the term normally used is multisensory integration. 
4448.97,"And if this is true, we could do the following experiment. "
4452.96,We can train a mouse 
4457.04,to lick sweet. 
4462.845,"And if they guess correctly, "
4463.97,that that is supposed to be sweet. 
4465.86,"They should go now to the right port, to the right side, "
4471.26,to get a water reward. 
4474.53,"If they go to the lift, when it was sweet, "
4478.16,then they're incorrect and they get no reward 
4482.18,and they actually get a time out. 
4484.88,"Now the mice are thirsty, "
4486.62,so they're very motivated to perform. 
4489.02,"And if you repeat this task a hundred times, "
4492.44,"a hundred trials, incredibly enough, "
4495.11,this animal learned to recognize the sweet 
4498.05,and execute the right action. 
4500.12,"And by their action, "
4502.13,we now are being told what that animal is tasting. 
4508.01,We can make it more interesting 
4509.33,"and we can give him sweet and bitter and say, "
4511.19,if it's sweet go to the right 
4513.764,and if it's bitter go to the left. 
4515.36,And after you train him this mice with 
90%,"accuracy, "
4518.63,"it'll tell you, when you randomize now the stimuli, "
4522.2,what was sweet and what was bitter? 
4525.56,"We can now do the same experiment, "
4528.32,"but now mix taste with odor and say, "
4533.66,"if you got odor alone, "
4538.37,go to the right or push this lever in mice. 
4543.44,"If you get taste alone, "
4545.87,go to this other part or push this other lever. 
4549.65,"And if you get the two together, do this something else. "
4553.58,"And if you train the mice, "
4555.02,the mice are able now to report back to you when it's 
4558.14,"sensing taste alone, odor alone, or the mix. "
4565.01,Makes sense? - Makes sense. 
4567.22,- Now we can go to the brain of this mice and go 
4570.65,"to this area that we now uncover, "
4573.05,discover as being the side of multisensory integration 
4577.16,"between taste and odor, and silence it, "
4582.02,prevent it from being activated experimentally. 
4586.375,And if that area really represented 
4589.52,"the integration of these two, "
4591.62,the animals should still be able 
4593.09,to recognize the taste alone. 
4595.16,"They still should be able to recognize the other alone, "
4598.19,"but should be incapable now to recognize the mix, "
4604.55,and exactly as predicted. 
4606.95,That's exactly what you get. 
4609.335,All right? 
4610.22,- The brain is basically 
4611.72,"a series of engineered circuits, complex. "
4615.47,- You got it. 
4616.812,And our task is to figure out how can we extract 
4623.18,this amazing architecture of these circuits 
4627.033,in a way that we can begin to uncover 
4630.02,the mysteries of the brain. 
4632.96,- And why certain people's breath tastes so good 
4636.506,and other people's not so good. 
4638.75,- Exactly. 
4639.583,"So I never answered that, "
4640.416,but I told you how we can figure out 
4642.08,where in the brain it's happening. 
4645.86,"- As we've been having this discussion, "
4648.185,I thought a few times about similarities 
4652.106,"to the visual system or differences to the visual system, "
4654.11,"the visual system, "
4654.943,there are a couple of phenomenon that I wonder 
4659.402,"if they also exist in the taste system, "
4661.693,"and the visual system we know for instance, "
4663.86,that if you look at something long enough 
4664.693,"and activate the given receptors long enough, "
4667.04,that object will actually disappear. 
4669.35,"We offset this with little micro eye movements, "
4671.36,"et cetera, but the principle is a fundamental one. "
4673.73,"This habituation or desensitization, "
4675.77,"everyone seems to call it something different, "
4677.63,"but you get the idea of course, "
4680.87,"in the taste system, "
4683.21,"I'm certainly familiar with eating something very, "
4685.25,very sweet for the first time in a long time. 
4687.95,"And it feel tastes very sweet, but a few more licks, "
4690.8,"a few more bites, "
4691.67,"and now it tastes not as sweet, with olfaction, "
4695.09,"I'm familiar with the odor in a room I don't like, "
4697.52,"or I like, and then it disappearing. "
4698.93,"So similar phenomena, where does that occur? "
4704.949,And can you imagine a sort of a system 
4709.01,by which people could leverage that? 
4711.62,Because I do think that most people are interested 
4715.448,"in eating, not more sugar, but less sugar. "
4718.638,- I think we have better ways to approach that. 
4719.537,And we can transition from taste into these other circuits 
4724.55,that makes sugar so extraordinarily 
4730.04,impossible not to consume. 
4733.58,"- Impossible, exactly. "
4737.658,- So where does the desensitizing happen. 
4742.01,"That's the term that we use, and it's, "
4748.598,"I think happening at multiple stations, "
4751.97,it's happening at the receptor level. 
4755.57,I.e. the salt in your tongue 
4758.42,"that are sensing the sugar, "
4761.54,as you activate this receptor 
4763.34,"and it's triggering activity after activity after activity, "
4767.06,"eventually you exhaust the receptor again, "
4770.12,I'm using terms which are extraordinarily loose. 
4774.92,- But for sake of this discussion. 
4776.867,- For the sake of this discussion the receptor 
4780.2,"gets to a point where he undergoes a set of changes, "
4784.01,"chemical changes, where it now signals far less efficiently, "
4790.64,or it even gets removed from the surface of the cell. 
4795.587,And now what will happen is that the same amount 
4798.35,of sugar will trigger far less of a response. 
4803.869,And that is a huge side of this modulation. 
4809.24,"And then the next, I believe is the integrated again, "
4812.93,loss of signaling that happens by continuous activation 
4817.31,of the circuit at each of these different neural stations. 
4820.91,"You know, there is from the tongue to the ganglia, "
4823.76,from the ganglia to the first station 
4826.078,"in the brain stem, a second station in the brain stem, "
4829.13,"to the thalamus, then to the cortex. "
4832.25,So there are multiple steps that this signal is traveling. 
4835.19,"Now, you might say why, if this is a label line, "
4837.89,why do you need to have so many stations? 
4841.07,And that's because the taste system is so important to 
4843.89,"ensure that you get what you need to survive, "
4848.03,that it has to be subjected 
4849.53,to modulation by the internal state. 
4853.22,And each of these nodes provides a new site 
4857.33,"to give it plasticity and modulation, "
4860.93,"not necessarily to change the way that something tastes, "
4865.04,but to ensure that you consume more 
4868.73,or less or differently of what you need. 
4872.9,I'm going to give you one example 
4874.91,of how the internal state changes 
4876.44,the way the taste system works. 
4879.35,Salt is very appetitive at low concentrations. 
4885.38,And that's because we need it. 
4888.14,It's our electro lite balance requires salt. 
4891.02,Every one of our neurons uses salt 
4893.09,as the most important of the ions 
4895.61,with potassium to ensure that you can transfer 
4898.46,"these electrical signals within and between neurons, "
4904.4,"but at high concentrations, "
4906.11,"let's say ocean water, it's incredibly aversive. "
4910.85,And we all know this because we are going to the ocean. 
4913.705,"And then when you get it in your mouth, it's not that great. "
4917.39,"However, if I salt deprive you, and we can do this "
4922.04,"in experimental models quite readily, "
4927.44,"now this incredibly high concentration of salt, "
4931.269,one molar sodium chloride becomes 
4933.5,amazingly appetitive and attractive. 
4937.04,What's going on in here. 
4939.17,"Your tongue is telling you, this is horrible, "
4942.5,"but your brain is telling you, I don't care. "
4946.4,You need it. 
4949.73,And this is what we call the modulation 
4953.36,of the taste system by the internal state. 
4957.65,"- And presumably if one is hungry enough, "
4959.42,even uni will taste good. 
4962.822,Just hit you hit it right on the money. 
4963.904,"No, no, this is exactly correct. "
4965.99,"Or if you're thirsty and hungry, "
4969.74,you suppress hunger so that you don't 
4973.07,waste water molecules in digesting food. 
4976.888,Why? 
4977.96,"Because if you're thirsty and you have no water, "
4981.38,"you will die within a week or so, "
4984.38,but you can on a hunger strike as long 
4986.57,"as you have water for months, "
4990.68,because you're going to eat up all your energy reserves. 
4994.58,Water is a different story. 
4996.02,"So you could see, "
4996.95,or that there are multiple layers 
5000.22,at which the taste system that guides 
5005.05,our drive and our motivation to consume 
5008.26,the nutrients we need has to be modulated 
5013.03,in response to the internal state. 
5015.79,"And of course, "
5017.256,internal state itself has 
5018.089,to be modulated by the external world. 
5021.783,"And so that I think is a reason why, what could otherwise, "
5025.63,would've been an incredibly simple system 
5027.58,from the tongue to the cortex in one just wire. 
5032.53,"It's not, because you have to ensure "
5036.084,that each step you give the system 
5039.31,that level of flexibility 
5041.47,"or what we call in neuroscience, plasticity. "
5045.16,- I think we're headed into the gut. 
5047.26,But I have a question that has just been 
5050.29,"on my mind for a bit now, "
5052.87,because I was drinking this water 
5055.0,and it has essentially no taste. 
5058.33,Is there any kind of signal for the absence of taste despite 
5062.5,"having something in the mouth and here is why I ask, "
5066.458,what I'm thinking about is saliva. 
5069.729,And while it's true that if I eat a lot of very highly 
5071.62,palatable foods that does change 
5074.32,"how I experience more bland foods, "
5077.62,I must confess when I eat a lot of these highly processed 
5080.38,foods I don't particularly like them. 
5081.79,"I tend to crave healthier foods, "
5083.17,"but that's probably for contextual reasons about nutrients, "
5086.29,et cetera. 
5088.15,But I could imagine an experiment where- 
5090.61,- You see a taste of no taste. 
5093.137,"- Right, is there a taste of no taste, "
5093.97,because in the visual system there is. 
5096.22,You close the eyes and you start getting increases in 
5098.68,"activity in the visual system, as opposed to decreases, "
5101.05,which often surprises people. 
5102.61,But there are reasons for that because everything is about 
5105.07,"signal to noise, signal to background. "
5107.77,- It's a good question. 
5109.387,I can tell you that most of our work is trying to focus on 
5112.03,"how the taste system works, not how it doesn't work well, "
5117.16,but you know. 
5117.993,"- Yeah, I know you're being playful. "
5121.066,"And I knew when inviting you here today, "
5121.899,"I was setting myself up for, "
5123.43,actually on a different- 
5125.11,- We're trying to learn things. 
5127.066,"- Yeah, I know. - However- "
5128.108,"- All right, listen, I was weaned in this system of a, "
5130.69,and I'll say it here for the second. 
5132.61,Actually I recorded a podcast recently with a very prominent 
5135.82,podcast with Lex Friedman Podcast. 
5137.59,And I made reference to the so-called 
5140.357,New York neuroscience mafia. 
5141.61,I won't say whether or not we are sitting in the presence of 
5144.13,"the New York neuroscience mafia member, but in any event, "
5148.33,I know the sorts of ribbing 
5150.01,"that they provide for those listening, "
5152.35,this is the kind of hazing that happens. 
5154.21,Benevolent hazing in academia. 
5157.06,I'm the target. 
5157.93,"- Of course, it's- "
5159.34,- It's a sign of love. 
5160.57,- Exactly. - He's going to tell me that. 
5162.19,"- And it's always about the science in the end, right. "
5166.308,But it's an interesting question. 
5167.41,"Look, I am, "
5169.57,I don't know the answer 
5173.815,and I don't even know how I would explore it in a way 
5176.823,"that it will rigorously teach me, eh, but. "
5186.49,- Let me tell you why I'm asking. 
5187.87,And then I'll offer an experiment 
5189.46,that I'd love to see someone here in the lab do. 
5192.941,I'm thinking about saliva. 
5194.29,"- No, no, no, but that we know, "
5195.55,that we can figure it out. 
5197.459,- Obviously. 
5198.859,But the question is whether or not the saliva in a fed state 
5202.96,"is distinct from the saliva in an unfed state, "
5206.47,"such that it modulates the sensitivity, the response. "
5208.396,"- It's not the sensitivity, "
5209.585,the experiment has been done. 
5211.124,- [Andrew] It has been done. 
5211.974,And so the answer is no. 
5213.25,- It's not. 
5214.083,And the way you could do the experiment is 
5215.966,because we use artificial saliva. 
5218.771,- There's such a thing? 
5219.604,"I know there's artificial tears, but. "
5221.5,"- No, no, we, "
5222.43,"I don't mean that you go to Walgreens that you get, I mean, "
5226.15,"we, in my laboratory, "
5227.89,we know the composition of saliva 
5230.681,"and so you can make such a thing, "
5234.07,and you can take taste cells in culture 
5237.37,"or in a tongue where you wash it out, "
5240.43,and then you can apply artificial saliva. 
5243.34,And what happens is that the system 
5246.232,"is being engineered to desensitize, "
5249.07,to become agnostic for saliva to become invisible. 
5257.681,And there is no difference on the state of the animal. 
5261.2,"- Great, well, this is the reason to do experiments. "
5262.24,"- [Charles] Yeah, absolutely. "
5263.827,- So it doesn't defeat any grand hypothesis. 
5264.82,It's just a pure curiosity. 
5268.0,- You know that curiosity kills the cat? 
5269.92,"- I do, "
5273.97,but saves the career of a scientists every single time. 
5278.114,"- That's what drives us, absolutely. "
5279.382,- Every single time. 
5280.383,- It's the story of our lives. - Exactly. 
5282.1,"So if it's not saliva and apparently it is not, "
5286.913,"what about internal state and what aspects of this, "
5291.97,"the internal milieu are relevant because there's autonomic, "
5295.15,"there's a sleep and awake, there's stress. "
5297.16,One of the questions that 
5299.083,I got from hundreds of people when I solicited questions in 
5301.57,advance of this episode was why do 
5303.49,"I crave sugar when I'm stressed, for instance, "
5306.19,"and that could be contextual, "
5307.24,but what are the basic elements- 
5309.04,"- Because it makes us feel good by the way, "
5310.72,we'll get to that. 
5312.287,That's his answer. - Soothing. 
5314.047,"- It activates, "
5316.18,what I'm going to generically refer to as reward pleasure 
5322.03,"centers in a way that it dramatically, "
5325.958,changes our internal state. 
5328.51,This is in why do we eat a gallon ice cream 
5330.7,when we're very depressed? 
5333.46,"In fact, this is a good segue to go "
5336.55,into this an entire different world 
5340.84,of the body telling your brain 
5345.76,"what you need in important things like sugar and fat, "
5351.31,"but anyways, go ahead, you were going to ask something. "
5354.618,"- Well, no, I would like to discuss "
5356.806,"the most basic elements of internal state in particular, "
5360.64,the ones that are below our conscious detection. 
5363.19,"And this is a, "
5365.23,"of course is a segue into this incredible landscape, "
5369.22,"which is the gut brain axis, "
5371.11,which I think 
15,"years ago was almost a, "
5375.55,maybe it was posters at a meeting. 
5379.498,"And then now I believe you and others, "
5382.754,"there are companies, there have companies, "
5384.16,"there are active research programs, "
5387.58,and beautiful work. 
5389.47,Maybe you could describe some of that work 
5390.85,that you and others have been involved in. 
5392.8,And a lot of the listeners of this podcast will have heard 
5397.24,of the gut brain axis. 
5398.38,And there are a lot of misconceptions 
5400.63,about the gut brain axis. 
5401.62,Many people think that this means that we think with our 
5404.26,"stomach because of the quote unquote, gut feeling aspect, "
5409.702,but I'd love for you to talk about the aspects of gut brain 
5412.24,signaling that drive or change our perceptions 
5415.12,and behaviors that are completely beneath our awareness. 
5418.3,- Yes. Excellent. 
5419.83,"So let me begin maybe by stating that, "
5425.77,the brain needs to monitor 
5430.66,"the state of every one of our organs, "
5434.59,it has to do it. 
5436.0,This is the only way that the brain can ensure that every 
5441.04,one of those organs are working together in a way that we 
5445.63,have healthy physiology. 
5449.38,"Now, "
5450.67,"this monitoring of the brain has been known for a long time, "
5455.38,but I think what hadn't been fully appreciated that this is 
5458.26,"a two-way highway where the brain is not only monitoring, "
5464.14,but is now modulating back what the body needs to do. 
5471.437,And that includes all the way from monitoring the frequency 
5474.55,of heartbeats and the way that inspiration and aspirations 
5479.62,in the breeding cycle operate to what happens when you 
5483.64,ingest sugar and fat. 
5488.32,"Now, let me give you an example again, "
5496.821,of how the brain can take 
5501.07,what we would refer to contextual associations and transform 
5506.77,it into incredible changes in physiology and metabolism. 
5512.95,Remember Pavlov? 
5515.013,"So Pavlov in his classical experiments in conditioning, "
5518.35,"associative conditioning, he would take a bell, "
5522.37,he would ring the bell every time 
5525.595,he was going to feed the dog. 
5528.383,And eventually the dog learned to associate 
5530.8,the ringing of the bell with food coming. 
5534.467,"Now, the first incredible finding "
5538.33,he made is the fact that the dog now 
5541.9,in the presence of the bell alone 
5544.48,will start to salivate. 
5547.18,And we will call that 
5548.77,neurologically speaking an anticipatory response. 
5554.14,"Okay, I could understand it. "
5555.64,I get it. 
5556.93,"You know, neurons in the brain that form "
5559.0,that association now represent food is coming. 
5562.9,And they're sending a signal to motor neurons to go into 
5567.7,your salivary glands to squeeze them. 
5570.07,"So you release saliva because you know food is coming, "
5576.01,but what's even more remarkable is that those animals are 
5579.49,also releasing insulin in response to a bell. 
5586.24,Okay. 
5589.474,"This illustrates one part of this two-way highway, "
5593.08,"the highway going down, "
5595.78,somehow the brain created these associations and there are 
5598.63,neurons in your brain now that no food is coming and send a 
5603.22,signal somehow all the way down to your pancreas that now it 
5608.062,says release insulin because sugar is coming down. 
5613.294,This goes back to the magic of the brain. 
5616.227,It's a never ending source of both joy and intrigue. 
5620.35,How the hell do they do this? 
5623.23,"I mean, the neurons. "
5625.003,- I share your delight and fascination. 
5627.85,There's not a day or a lecture or some talks are better than 
5633.76,"others or talk where I don't sit back and just think, "
5637.398,it's absolutely amazing. 
5638.964,- How. - It's amazing. 
5640.52,"- Now over the past, I don't know, "
5642.79,dozen years it and with great force 
5646.222,over the last five years 
5649.78,"now, the main highway that is communicating "
5652.9,"the state of the body with the brain, "
5657.304,it has been uncovered as being 
5659.863,what we now refer to as the gut brain axis. 
5663.73,And the highway is a specific bundle of nerves 
5669.4,"which emerged from the Vagal ganglia, the nodus ganglia. "
5673.03,And so it's the vagus nerve that is innervating 
5677.71,the majority of the organs in your body. 
5682.12,"It's monitoring their function, "
5684.55,sending a signal to the brain. 
5686.89,"And now the brain going back down and saying, "
5690.4,"this is going alright, do this, "
5692.23,"or this is not going too well, do that. "
5695.5,"- And I should point out as you well know, every organ, "
5698.59,"spleen, pancreas, lung. "
5701.68,- They all must be monitored. 
5704.92,"In fact I now, "
5708.389,I have no doubt that the diseases that we have normally 
5711.67,"associated with metabolism, physiology, "
5716.193,"and even immunity are likely to emerge as diseases, "
5723.22,"conditions, states of the brain. "
5727.45,I don't think obesity is a disease of metabolism. 
5731.56,I believe obesity is a disease of brain circuits. 
5735.82,- [Andrew] I do as well. 
5737.23,"- And so this view that we have, "
5741.145,"been working on for the longest time, because, "
5746.08,"the molecules that we're dealing with are in the body, "
5748.54,"not in the head, led us to to view, "
5752.86,of course this issues and problems has been one of 
5756.58,"metabolism, physiology, and so forth. "
5758.56,"They remain to be the carriers of the ultimate signal, "
5763.24,but the brain ultimately appears to be the conductor of this 
5767.8,orchestra of physiology and metabolism. 
5771.46,"All right, now let's go to the gut brain and sugar, "
5776.71,maybe. 
5777.7,"- Please, please. "
5780.913,"No, I mean, "
5782.02,the vagus nerve has in popular culture has been kind of 
5788.95,"converted into this single meaning of calming pathways, "
5794.02,mostly because I actually have to tip my hat 
5797.11,to the yogic community was 
5799.21,"among the first to talk about vagus on and on and on, "
5804.34,"there are calming pathways, "
5807.28,so-called parasympathetic pathways within the vagus. 
5811.287,"But I think that the more we learn about the vagus, "
5812.8,"the more it seems like an entire set of neural connections, "
5817.06,as opposed to one nerve. 
5818.53,I just wanted to just mention that because I think 
5820.18,a lot of people have heard 
5821.26,about the vagus turns out experimentally 
5823.36,"in the laboratory, "
5824.56,many neuroscientists will stimulate the vagus 
5827.05,"to create states of alertness and arousal when animals, "
5831.22,or even people believe it or not are close to dying 
5833.95,or going into coma stimulation 
5835.66,of the vagus is one of the ways 
5836.77,to wake up the brain counter to the idea 
5839.62,that it's just this I way of calming oneself down. 
5842.2,"- And also of course, I mean, "
5844.06,one has to be cautious they're in that. 
5847.664,So the vagus nerve is made 
5850.75,"out of many thousands of fibers, "
5854.71,individual fibers that make this gigantic bundle. 
5858.19,"And it's likely as we're speaking, "
5860.5,that each of these fibers carries 
5863.837,"a slightly different meaning, "
5865.51,"not necessarily one by one, maybe five is "
"10,",
5868.84,five is 
"20,","do all right, "
5871.393,but they carry meaning that's associated 
5875.02,with their specific task. 
5878.14,This group of fibers is telling the brain 
5880.81,about the state of your heart. 
5883.78,This group of fiber is telling 
5885.4,the brain about the state of your gut. 
5888.88,"This is telling your brain about its nutritional state, "
5893.05,"this, your pancreas, this your lungs. "
5897.43,"And they are again, to make the same simple example, "
5903.457,the keys of this piano. 
5906.555,"Yes, you're right. "
5908.26,"There is a lot of data, "
5913.06,showing that activating the entire vagal bundle has very 
5919.39,meaningful effects in a wide range of conditions. 
5922.9,"In fact, it's being used to treat untractable depression. "
5929.02,- A little stimulator. 
5931.54,- Epileptics seizures. 
5935.02,"But again, there are thousands "
5937.03,of fibers carrying different functions. 
5939.58,So to some degree this is like 
5946.72,"turning the lights on the stadium, "
5952.57,because you need to illuminate 
5955.15,where you lost your keys under your seat. 
5958.72,Yet 
"10,",
000,bulbs of a thousand Watts each have just come on. 
5966.43,"Only one of this is pointing to where, "
5970.577,and so I'm lucky enough that one 
5971.86,of them happened to point to my side. 
5977.844,So here you activate the bundle thousands of fibers. 
5979.93,"I'm lucky enough that some of those happen to do something, "
5985.06,"to make a meaningful difference in depression, "
5988.9,or to make a meaningful difference in epileptics. 
5991.57,But it should not be misconstrued 
5995.86,as arguing that this broad activation 
6000.96,"has any type of selectivity or specificity, "
6005.04,we're just lucky enough that among all the things 
6007.806,"that are being done, some of those happen to change "
6012.21,the biology of these processes. 
6014.64,"Now, the reason this is relevant "
6016.98,because the magic of this gut brain axis 
6021.54,is the fact that you have these thousands 
6023.25,of fibers really doing different functions and our goal. 
6029.46,"And along with many other great scientists, "
6037.26,"including Steve Lieder Lee, "
6038.97,that started a lot of this molecular dissection 
6044.005,"on this vagal gut brain communication line at Harvard, "
6050.122,is trying to uncover what 
6052.2,"each of those lines doing, "
6054.51,what are each of those keys of this piano playing? 
6060.014,- What's the latest there? 
6060.995,Just as a brief update. 
6061.828,"I know Steven Lieder Lee, "
6062.76,I think I was there when he got 
6065.19,his Howard Hughes and I did not. 
6066.72,So that was fun. 
6067.8,Always great to get beat by excellent people. 
6071.018,"- First of all, I'm happy you didn't, "
6071.851,because that way you can focus on this amazing podcast. 
6075.84,"- Well, thank you. "
6077.158,That's very gracious of you. 
6078.09,It's always feels better if not good 
6081.87,to get beat out by excellent people. 
6083.28,Steven is second to none. 
6086.82,"And he is defining, as you said, "
6088.98,the molecular constituents 
6091.26,"of different elements of these many, many fibers, "
6093.66,"is there an update there, "
6094.59,are they finding multiple parallel pathways? 
6097.02,"- They are, they are, some that control heartbeat. "
6100.831,Some that control the respiratory cycle. 
6103.02,Some that might be involved in a gastric movement. 
6109.56,"You know, this notion that you're full "
6112.41,and you feel full in part 
6115.533,"because your gut gets distended your stomach, for example. "
6120.0,And then there are little sensors that are reading 
6122.13,that and telling the brain you're full. 
6125.876,- So the textbooks will soon change 
6128.55,on the basis of the Lieder Lee and other work. 
6132.406,"- In essence, I think we are learning enough "
6133.86,"about these lines, that could really help put together "
6142.2,this holistic view of how the brain 
6147.3,"it's truly changing body physiology, "
6151.38,"metabolism, and immunity, "
6154.23,"the part that hasn't been yet developed, "
6158.749,"and that it needs a fair amount of work, "
6159.939,"but it's an exciting thrilling, "
6163.92,journey of discovery is how 
6165.447,the signal comes back to now change that biology. 
6170.819,"You know, the example I gave you before with Pavlov's dog. "
6174.96,I figure out how the association created 
6178.986,"this link between the bell, "
6180.9,but then how does the brain tell the pancreas 
6184.11,to release in the right amount of insulin? 
6188.28,"So, "
6191.601,let me tell you about the gut brain axis 
6197.588,and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat. 
6203.37,"Insatiable for sugar, "
6205.41,unquenchable for fat. 
6210.212,And this is a story about the fundamental difference 
6215.812,between liking and wanting. 
6221.07,Liking sugar is the function of the taste system. 
6229.53,"And it's not really liking sugar, "
6231.6,"it's liking sweet, "
6235.68,"wanting sugar, "
6239.43,our never ending appetite for sugar is the story 
6245.16,"of the gut brain axis, "
6249.191,liking versus wanting. 
6251.777,And this work is work of my own laboratory. 
6254.4,"You know, that began long ago "
6256.56,when we discovered the sweet receptors 
6260.58,and you can now engineer mice that lack these receptors. 
6266.58,"So in essence, "
6267.63,these animals will be unable 
6269.22,"to taste sweet, a life without sweetness. "
6274.95,How horrible. 
6277.2,"And if you give a normal mouse, a bottle containing sweet, "
6282.51,"and we're going to put either sugar or an artificial sweetener, "
6286.83,they bottle sweet. 
6288.33,"They have slightly different tastes, "
6290.88,but that's simply because artificial sweeteners 
6295.32,have some off tastes. 
6297.63,"But as far as the sweet receptor is concerned, "
6301.398,"they both activate the same receptor, "
6303.03,trigger the same signal. 
6305.73,"And if you give an animal, "
6306.75,an option of a bottle containing sugar 
6308.91,"or a sweetener versus water, "
6311.97,this animal will drink 
10,to one 
6314.61,from the bottle containing sweet. 
6317.04,"That's the taste system, animal goes samples, each one, "
6320.58,"licks a couple of licks and then says, "
6322.89,that's the one I want because it's appetitive. 
6324.86,And because I love it. 
6328.005,- So it prefers sugar to artificial sweetener? 
6329.97,"- No, no, no, no, no, no. "
6332.219,"In this experiment, this experiment, "
6333.93,I'm going to put only sweet in one bottle 
6336.78,and it could be either sugar or artificial sweetener. 
6339.39,It doesn't matter which one. 
6341.31,We're going to do the next experiment 
6343.05,"where we separate those two, "
6344.37,for now is sweet versus water. 
6349.13,"And sweet means sweet, not sugar. "
6351.21,Sweet means anything that tastes sweet. 
6355.921,And sugar is one example and Splenda is another example. 
6360.071,"- Aspartame, monk fruit, Stevia, doesn't matter. "
6363.81,"- I mean, there's some that only humans can taste. "
6367.615,Mice cannot taste because their receptors 
6369.96,"between humans and mice are different, "
6372.6,but we have put the human receptor into mice. 
6376.98,We engineer mice and we completely 
6379.44,humanize this mouse's taste world. 
6386.735,"But for the purpose of this conversation, "
6389.52,"we're only comparing sweet versus water, an option. "
6393.0,"My goodness, "
6394.731,they will lick to know and from the sweet side 
10,"to one, "
6399.18,"at least versus the water, makes sense? "
6402.57,"All right, now we're going to take the mice "
6404.79,and we're going to genetically engineer it 
6407.61,to remove the sweet receptors. 
6410.76,"So this mice no longer have in their oral cavity, "
6413.73,"any sensors that can detect sweetness, "
6416.79,"be that sugar molecule be an artificial sweetener, "
6420.27,be anything else that tastes sweet. 
6424.205,And if you give this mice an option 
6425.4,"between sweet versus water, "
6428.28,"sugar versus water, artificial sweetener versus water, "
6431.88,it will drink equally well from both 
6434.959,because he cannot tell them apart 
6436.355,because it doesn't have the receptors for sweet. 
6437.34,So that sweet bottle tastes just like water. 
6441.72,Makes sense? - Makes sense. 
6443.01,- Very good. 
6445.731,Now we're going to do the experiment 
6447.623,with sugar from now on let's focus on sugar. 
6449.16,So I'm going to give a mouse out sugar versus water. 
6454.17,"Normal mouse will drink from the sugar, "
6456.51,"sugar, sugar, sugar, very little from the water, "
6461.04,"knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them. "
6465.133,Mouse can no longer tell them apart. 
6466.14,And they will drink from both. 
6469.23,But if I keep the mouse in that case for the next 
48,"hours, "
6475.56,something extraordinary happens when I come 
48,hours later. 
6479.97,"And I see what the mouse is licking or drinking from, "
6483.78,that mouse is drinking almost exclusively 
6486.9,from the sugar bottle. 
6489.27,How could this be? 
6491.1,It cannot not taste it. 
6493.41,It doesn't have sweet receptors during those 
48,hours 
6498.87,the mouse learn that there is something 
6502.17,in that bottle that makes me feel good. 
6507.18,And that is the bottle I want to consume. 
6512.009,Now does the mouse identify that bottle? 
6514.26,"It does so by using other sensory features, "
6518.07,"the smell of the bottle, "
6520.53,"the texture of the solution inside, sugar, "
6523.98,"the high concentrations is kind of goopy, "
6527.52,the side in which the bottle is in the cage. 
6531.102,"It doesn't matter what, "
6533.49,but the mouse realize there is something 
6536.13,there that makes me feel good. 
6538.92,And that's what I want. 
6541.738,And that is the fundamental basis of our unquenchable 
6547.71,desire and our craving for sugar 
6551.16,and is mediated by the gut brain axis. 
6555.42,"The first clue is that it takes a long time to develop, "
6559.98,immediately suggesting a post-ingestive effect. 
6566.43,So we reason if this is true and it's the gut brain axis 
6570.0,that's driving sugar preference. 
6574.95,Then there should be a group of neurons in the brain 
6577.44,"that are responding to post-ingestive sugar, "
6583.17,"and low and behold, "
6584.866,we identify a group of neurons in the brain 
6586.773,that does this and these neurons receive 
6588.66,their input directly from 
6591.72,the gut brain axis. 
6594.24,- From other neurons. 
6595.86,- You got it. 
6598.83,And so what's happening is that sugar is recognized normally 
6603.9,"by the tongue, activates an appetitive response. "
6609.138,Now you ingest it and now it activates a selective group 
6612.33,of cells in your intestines 
6615.51,that now send a signal to the brain 
6618.39,"via the vagal ganglia that says, "
6623.4,I got what I need. 
6625.44,The tongue doesn't know that you got what you need. 
6628.23,It only knows that you tasted it. 
6631.38,This knows that it got to the point 
6633.93,"that it's going to be used, which is the gut. "
6637.68,And now it sends the signal to now reinforce 
6641.82,"the consumption of this thing, "
6644.28,because this is the one that I needed. 
6646.86,"Sugar, source of energy. "
6649.931,- And are these neurons in the gut? 
6652.513,- So these are not neurons in the gut. 
6654.055,So these are gut cells that recognize the sugar molecule. 
6657.12,- [Andrew] I see. 
6658.859,- Send the signal and that signal is received 
6660.3,by the vagal neuron directly. 
6662.01,- Got it. 
6662.88,- And it sends a signal through the gut brain axis 
6667.677,"to the cell bodies of these neurons in the vagal ganglia, "
6671.367,and from there to the brain stem 
6674.79,to now trigger the preference for sugar. 
6678.66,- Two questions. 
6679.53,"One, you mentioned that these cells "
6682.29,that detect sugar within 
6683.67,the gut are actually within the intestine. 
6685.68,You didn't say stomach. 
6687.45,Which surprised me. 
6688.283,"I always think gut as stomach, but of course- "
6690.69,"- They're intestines, "
6692.745,because that's where all the absorption happens. 
6693.578,- [Andrew] Got it. 
6695.117,"- So you want the signal, you see, "
6695.95,you want the brain to know that you had successful ingestion 
6699.66,and breakdown of whatever you consume into 
6703.17,"the building blocks of life, "
6706.53,"and glucose, amino acids, fat. "
6710.01,And so you want to make sure that once they are in the form 
6713.94,"that intestines can now absorb them, "
6717.3,is where you get the signal back saying this what I want. 
6721.65,Now let me just take it one step further. 
6726.03,And this now sugar molecules activates this unique gut brain 
6731.31,circuit that now drives the development 
6735.373,of our preference for sugar. 
6738.789,"Now, a key element of this circuit "
6743.73,is that the sensors in the gut that recognize 
6747.42,the sugar do not recognize artificial sweeteners at all. 
6753.42,- Because their nutrient value 
6755.16,is uncoupled from the taste? 
6759.0,"- Generically speaking one can make that, "
6760.429,but it's because it's a very different type of receptor. 
6764.7,Turns out that it's not 
6765.72,the tongue receptors being used in the gut. 
6769.02,It's a completely different molecule that only recognizes 
6772.53,"the glucose molecule, not artificial sweeteners. "
6776.46,This has a profound impact 
6781.764,on the effect of ultimately artificial sweeteners 
6786.137,"in curbing our appetite, our craving, "
6789.99,"our insatiable desire for sugar, "
6793.56,"since they don't activate the gut brain axis, "
6798.12,they'll never satisfy the craving for sugar like sugar does. 
6805.37,And the reason I believe that artificial sweeteners 
6807.78,have failed in the market to curb our appetite. 
6813.96,"Our need, our desire for sugar is "
6817.89,because they beautifully work on the tongue. 
6822.18,"They liking to recognize sweet versus non-sweet, "
6828.51,but they fail to activate the key sensors 
6833.55,in the gut that now inform the brain 
6837.848,"you got sugar, no need to crave anymore. "
6842.76,"- So the issue of wanting, "
6847.26,can we relate that to a particular 
6849.18,"set of neurochemicals upstream, "
6851.4,"so the pathway is, so glucose is activating the cells "
6855.03,in the gut that through the vagus 
6856.47,that's communicated through the presumably 
6858.93,the nodus ganglia and up into the brain stem. 
6861.12,"- Very good, and from there, where does it go? "
6863.16,"- Yeah, where does it go, "
6864.776,and what is the substrate of wanting? 
6866.76,"Of course I think molecules like dopamine craving, "
6870.66,"there's a book even called the molecule of more, et cetera. "
6874.44,"Dopamine is a very diabolical molecule, as you know, "
6877.77,"because it evokes both a sense of pleasure-ish, "
6881.55,"but also a sense of desiring more, of craving. "
6886.165,"So if I understand you correctly, artificial sweeteners are, "
6889.14,and I agree are failing as a means 
6891.42,to satisfy sugar craving at the level of nutrient sensing. 
6897.66,And yet if we trigger this 
6900.66,"true sugar evoked wanting pathway too much, "
6906.15,"and we've all experienced this, "
6907.38,then we eat sugar and we find ourselves 
6909.6,wanting more and more sugar. 
6910.95,"Now that could also be insulin dysregulation, "
6913.83,but can we uncouple those? 
6916.05,"- I mean, look, "
6919.92,if we have a mega problem 
6924.39,"with over consumption of sugar and fat, "
6929.43,we're facing a unique time in our evolution where 
6934.98,diseases of malnutrition are due to over-nutrition. 
6939.96,"I mean, how nuts is that? "
6943.936,"Historically, diseases of malnutrition "
6945.96,have always been linked to undernutrition. 
6951.96,And so we need to come up with strategies 
6954.69,that can meaningfully change 
6960.63,the activation of these circuits that control 
6966.18,"our wanting certainly in the populations at risk, "
6974.644,and this gut brain circuit that ultimately 
6980.76,it's the lines of communication that are informing 
6984.12,"the brain, the presence of intestinal sugar, "
6988.285,"in this example, "
6989.64,"it's a very important target in the way we think about, "
6994.41,is there a way that we can 
6995.55,meaningfully modulate these circuits? 
6998.813,So I make your brain think 
7001.46,"that you got satisfied with sugar, "
7005.27,even though I'm not giving you sugar. 
7007.55,- So that immediately raises the question are the receptors 
7010.85,for glucose in these gut cells susceptible 
7014.57,to other things that are healthier for us. 
7017.81,- That's very good. 
7019.49,Excellent idea. 
7021.29,And I think an important goal will be to come up 
7026.06,with a strategy and identify 
7029.48,those very means that allow us to 
7032.57,modulate the circuits in a way 
7034.97,"that certainly for all of those, "
7038.96,"where this is a big issue, it can really have a, "
7044.33,"you know, dramatic impact in improving human health. "
7048.5,- I could be wrong about this. 
7049.64,And I'm happy to be wrong. 
7051.691,I'm often wrong. 
7052.94,"And told I'm wrong, that we have cells within our gut "
7058.04,"that don't just sense sugar, glucose to be specific, "
7063.364,but also cells within our gut 
7064.58,that sense amino acids and fatty acids. 
7068.27,I could imagine a scenario where one could train themselves 
7072.05,to feel immense amounts of satiety from the consumption 
7077.12,of foods that are rich in essential 
7079.46,"fatty acids, amino acids, "
7081.5,perhaps less caloric 
7083.51,or less insulin dysregulating than sugar. 
7088.31,I'll use myself as an example. 
7089.57,"I've always enjoyed sweets, "
7092.059,"but in the last few years, "
7093.298,for some reason I've started to lose my appetite 
7094.82,for them probably because I just don't eat them anymore. 
7098.15,At first that took some restriction. 
7100.13,Now I just don't even think about it. 
7102.11,- And you're not reinforcing the circuits. 
7104.96,"And so you're in essence are removing yourself from, "
7108.86,but you tend to be the exception. 
7112.37,"You know, we have a huge, "
7116.877,a incredible large number of people that are being 
7119.69,continuously exposed to highly processed foods. 
7123.77,"- And hidden, so called hidden sugars. "
7126.2,- They don't even have to be hidden. 
7128.39,"You know, it's right there. "
7129.68,- Hiding in plain sight. 
7131.63,I agree so much is made of hidden sugars that we often 
7135.71,overlook that there are also the overt sugars. 
7139.37,"- I mean, we can have a long discussion "
7142.902,on the importance of coming up with strategies 
7148.225,that could meaningfully change public health 
7150.11,when it comes to nutrition. 
7153.62,But I want to just go back to the notion of 
7156.86,this brain centers that are ultimately the ones 
7162.02,that are being activated by these essential nutrients. 
7165.56,"So sugar, fat, amino acids are building blocks of our diets. "
7173.36,And this is across all animal species. 
7176.6,So it's not unreasonable 
7178.19,then to assume that dedicated brain circuits 
7182.69,"would've evolved to ensure their recognition, "
7189.14,their ingestion and the reinforcement 
7194.15,that that is what I need. 
7198.77,And indeed animals evolve these two systems. 
7207.02,One is the taste system that allows you 
7210.59,to recognize them and trigger 
7212.9,"this predetermined, hardwired, immediate responses. "
7217.85,Oh my goodness. 
7218.683,This tastes so good. 
7220.192,It's so sweet. 
7221.025,"I personally have a sweet tooth, "
7223.58,"and you know, oh my God, this is so delicious. "
7225.95,"It's fatty or umami, recognizing the amino acids. "
7229.82,"So that's the liking pathway, "
7233.165,"but in the wisdom of evolution, "
7239.45,"that's good, "
7240.283,but doesn't quite do it. 
7241.97,You want to make sure that these things get to the place 
7244.04,where they're needed and they're not needed in your tongue. 
7249.5,They're needed in your intestines 
7251.51,where they're going to be absorbed 
7253.73,as the nutrients that will support life. 
7258.05,"And the brain wants to know this, "
7263.15,and it wants to know it in a way that it can now 
7265.97,form the association between 
7269.72,that I just tasted is what got 
7274.64,where it needs to be. 
7276.98,And it makes me feel good. 
7280.16,"And so now next time that I have to choose, "
7283.82,what should I eat? 
7286.67,"That association now guides me to, "
7290.45,that's the one I want. 
7292.28,"I want that fruit, not that fruit. "
7296.12,"I want those leaves, "
7297.56,"not those leaves, because these are the ones that activate "
7301.73,the right circuits that ensure that 
7304.083,the right nutrients got to the right place 
7305.51,"and told the brain, this is what I want and need. "
7312.59,Are we on? - We're on. 
7314.78,"One thing that intrigues me and puzzles me, "
7317.66,"is that this effect took a couple of days, at least in mice. "
7323.448,"And the sensation, ah, sorry, "
7324.41,the perception of taste is immediate. 
7327.423,and yet this is a slow system. 
7330.863,"And so in a beautiful way, but in a kind of mysterious way, "
7333.83,the brain is able to couple the taste of a sweet drink 
7337.49,"with the experience of nutrient extraction in the gut, "
7341.36,under a context where the mouse and the human 
7345.613,"is presumably ingesting other things, smelling other mice, "
7347.69,smelling other people. 
7349.07,That's incredible. 
7350.57,"- But you have to think of it not as humans, "
7353.33,remember we inherited the circuits of our ancestors 
7360.11,and they through evolutionary from their ancestors. 
7364.91,And we haven't had that many 
7367.16,years to have fundamentally changed in many 
7371.39,of these hardwired circuits. 
7373.962,"So forget as humans, "
7375.56,let's look at animals in the wild. 
7378.92,Which is easier now to comprehend the logic. 
7383.24,"You know, why should this take "
7385.58,a long time of continued reinforcement 
7389.21,given that I can taste it in a second? 
7394.25,"You want to make sure that this source of sugar, for example, "
7397.49,in the wild is the best. 
7400.22,Is the richest. 
7401.69,It's the one where I get the most energy 
7404.33,"for the least amount of extraction, "
7409.401,the least amount of work. 
7412.1,I want to identify rich sources of sugar. 
7417.618,And if the system simply responds immediately 
7420.92,"to the first sugar that gets to your gut, "
7423.5,you're going to form the association 
7426.68,"with those sources of food, "
7429.17,which are not the ones that you should be eating from. 
7433.524,- Don't fall in love with the first person you encounter. 
7436.029,"- Oh my goodness, exactly. "
7439.234,"And so evolutionarily by having the taste system, "
7442.82,"giving you the immediate recognition, "
7445.19,but then by forcing this gut brain axis 
7448.294,to reinforce it only when sustained 
7453.71,repeated exposure has informed the brain. 
7459.555,This is the one you don't want to form the association before. 
7463.91,And so when we remove it from the context 
7467.03,"of we just go to the supermarket, "
7471.95,we're not hunting there in the wild where I need to form. 
7476.12,And so what's is that highly processed foods are 
7483.68,"hijacking, co-opting these circuits in a way "
7490.802,that it would've never happened in nature. 
7492.986,And then we not only find these things appetitive 
7496.01,"and palatable, but in addition, "
7497.42,"we are continuously reinforcing, "
7500.78,"the wanting in a way that, oh my God, this is so great. "
7504.29,What do I feel like eating? 
7505.31,Let me have more of this. 
7508.038,- You've just forever changed the way 
7509.985,that I think about supermarkets and restaurants. 
7512.51,There are understanding this fast signaling 
7516.5,and this slower signaling 
7518.361,and the utility of having both makes me realize 
7523.018,that supermarkets and restaurants are 
7523.851,"about the most unnatural thing for our system ever, "
7528.8,almost the equivalent of living 
7531.02,in small villages with very few suitable mates 
7534.05,"versus online dating, for instance. "
7536.15,- I'm not going to make a judgment call there 
7539.283,because they do serve an important purpose. 
7541.066,- I like restaurants too. 
7542.12,"- And so do supermarkets, thank God. "
7545.39,I think they're not the culprits. 
7547.85,I think the culprits of course 
7552.895,are our reliance 
7557.266,on foods that are not necessarily healthy. 
7561.151,"Now, going back to the supermarket, "
7564.38,"don't fall in love with the first, they need to work. "
7567.914,"You know, you take "
7573.883,"a tangerine, "
7577.942,and you take an extract of tangerine 
7582.8,"that you used to cook that spiked, let's say with sugar "
7588.439,and you equalize in both 
7592.479,where they both provide the same amount of calories. 
7595.55,"If you eat them both, "
7598.28,they're going to have a very different effect 
7601.85,in your gut brain axis on your system. 
7605.57,Once you make the extract and you process it and you add 
7609.785,"processed sugar to use it now to cook, to add, "
7612.95,to make it really sweet tangerine thing. 
7616.539,Now you're providing now fully ready 
7619.13,"to use broken down source of sugar, "
7624.53,in the tangerine that sugar's mixed in the complexity 
7631.451,"of a whole set of other chemical components, "
7636.44,"fiber, long chains of sugar molecules "
7640.22,"that need a huge amount of work by your stomach, "
7645.802,"your gut system, to break it down. "
7649.07,So you are using a huge amount of energy 
7653.21,to extract energy and the balance 
7659.0,it's very different that when 
7663.351,"I take this process highly extracted tangerine, "
7667.548,by the way I use tangerines because I had a tangerine 
7668.96,just before I came here. 
7670.16,"- Delicious, they are delicious. "
7674.46,- And so this goes back to the issue of supermarkets. 
7678.26,"And to some degree, given a choice, "
7683.54,you don't want to eat highly processed foods 
7686.536,because everything's already been broken down for you. 
7689.578,And so your system has no work. 
7692.78,"And so you are, "
7694.574,co-opting hijacking the circuits in a way 
7696.14,that they're being activated 
7697.61,at a time scale that normally wouldn't happen. 
7702.982,"- Well, this is why I often feel that, "
7706.14,and I think a lot of data are now starting to support 
7708.505,the idea that while indeed the laws of thermodynamics apply 
7711.41,calories ingested versus calories burned 
7713.66,"is a very real thing, right? "
7718.724,That the appetite for certain foods 
7723.29,and the wanting and the liking 
7726.11,"are phenomena of the nervous system, "
7729.23,brain and gut as you've beautifully described. 
7731.84,"And that changes over time, "
7734.75,depending on how we are receiving these nutrients. 
7737.48,- Absolutely. 
7739.508,"Look, "
7741.65,we have a lot of work to do. 
7745.7,I'm talking as society. 
7747.62,I'm not talking about you and I. 
7749.99,- We also have a lot of work to do. 
7753.122,- Now. 
7755.12,I think understanding 
7755.953,the circuits is giving us important 
7759.32,"insights in how ultimately, "
7761.93,and hopefully we can improve human health 
7766.25,and make a meaningful difference. 
7770.78,"Now, it's very easy to try to connect "
7775.1,"the dots A to B, B to C, C to D. "
7779.177,"And I think there's a lot more complexity to it, "
7783.878,but I do think that the lessons that are emerging 
7786.38,"out of understanding how these circuits operate, "
7790.73,can ultimately inform how we deal with our diets 
7798.77,in a way that we avoid 
7800.75,what we're facing now as a society. 
7803.87,I mean it's nuts that over-nutrition happens 
7809.24,to be such a prevalent problem. 
7812.802,And I also think the training of people who are thinking 
7814.73,about metabolic science and metabolic disease is largely 
7818.09,divorced from the training 
7819.23,of the neuroscientist and vice versa. 
7821.39,"No one field is to blame, "
7822.71,but I fully agree that 
7825.384,"the brain is the key over, or the nervous system "
7829.222,to be more accurate is one of the key overlooked features. 
7832.43,"- Is the arbiter, "
7834.56,ultimately is the arbiter of many of these pathways. 
7838.28,- As a final question. 
7839.33,And one which is simply to entertain my curiosity 
7842.96,and the curiosity of the listeners. 
7846.05,What is your absolute favorite food? 
7849.26,"- Oh, my goodness. "
7852.59,"- Taste, I should say. "
7855.14,Taste to distinguish between taste 
7858.267,and the nutritive value or lack thereof. 
7860.977,"- Look, we, unlike every animal "
7863.037,"and every animal species eat for the enjoyment of it, "
7870.47,"it doesn't happen in the wild, "
7873.02,most animals eat when they need to eat. 
7876.74,"Doesn't mean they don't enjoy it, "
7880.261,but it's a completely different story. 
7885.914,I have too many favorite foods because I enjoy the sensory 
7889.4,experience rather than the food itself 
7893.69,"to me is the whole thing, is from the presentation, look, "
7896.841,"there've been these experiments done in psycho physics, "
7899.3,"I'm going to take a salad, made out of "
11,components 
7904.61,and I'm going to mix them all up in potpourri 
7909.304,greens and other things here. 
7910.55,"And in the other one, "
7912.355,I'm going to present it in a beautiful arrangement. 
7914.26,And I'm going to put them behind 
7915.52,a glass cabinet and I'm going to sell them. 
7917.846,And I'm going to sell one for $
2,and one for $
"8,",
7921.5,precisely the same ingredient. 
7923.3,Exactly the same amount of each. 
7926.39,"Ultimately you're going to mix them, "
7928.27,"they're all going to be the same, "
7930.62,and people will pay the $
8,"because you know what, "
7935.78,it evokes a different person. 
7939.5,"It gives you the feel that, oh my goodness, "
7942.65,I'm going to enjoy that salad. 
7946.07,"So going back to, "
7947.33,"what is my favorite food, "
7949.46,to me eating is really 
7955.848,a sensory journey. 
7959.116,"I don't mean the every day, let me have some "
7960.869,"chicken wings, because I'm hungry it, but eh, "
7967.49,every piece I think has an important 
7973.82,evoking sensory role. 
7979.61,And so in terms of categories 
7983.18,of food I grew up in Chile. 
7986.21,"So meat has always been, but I eat it so seldom now. "
7993.79,- Is that right? 
7995.75,"- Yeah, because I know that it's "
7997.169,"not necessarily the healthiest thing, "
7998.15,red meat I'm talking about. 
8001.45,And so I grew up eating it every day. 
8004.96,"I'm talking seven days a week, Chile, Argentina, "
8008.23,that's the mainstay of our diet. 
8013.21,Now maybe I have red meat. 
8016.337,"I don't know, once every four weeks. "
8020.77,- And you enjoy it? 
8021.64,"- Oh, I love it. "
8022.75,Part of it is because I haven't had it in four weeks. 
8026.17,"But you know, I love sushi, "
8030.785,"but I love the art of sushi, the whole thing, "
8034.99,"the way it's presented, it changes the way you taste it. "
8041.32,I love ethnic food in particular. 
8046.21,- You're in the right place. 
8048.103,"- You got it, that was the main reason "
8049.33,I wanted to come to New York. 
8050.5,"No, I'm just kidding. "
8052.834,- There's also that Columbia University that's- 
8055.26,- And I came here because I wanted to be with 
8057.79,"people that are thinking about the brain, "
8060.16,"the same way that I like to think, "
8061.78,"which can we solve this big problem, this big question. "
8067.001,- And certainly you're making amazing strides 
8068.86,in that direction. 
8069.79,And I love your answer because it really brings together 
8073.48,the many features of the circuitries 
8075.31,"and the phenomena we've been talking about today, "
8076.99,"which is that while it begins with sensation and perception, "
8080.32,ultimately it's the context. 
8081.91,"And that context is highly individual to person, "
8084.7,"place and time, and many, many other things "
8088.72,on behalf of myself. 
8090.76,"And certainly on behalf of all the listeners, "
8092.8,"I want to thank you, first of all, "
8094.57,for the incredible work 
8096.703,"that you've been doing now for decades, "
8097.891,"in vision, in taste and in this bigger issue "
8100.06,"of how we perceive and experience life, "
8103.06,it's truly pioneering and incredible work. 
8105.637,"And I feel quite lucky to have been on the sidelines, "
8109.45,seeing this over the years and hearing the talks 
8111.28,"and reading the countless beautiful papers, "
8114.31,but also for your time today
