0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.25 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
5.7 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.1 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor
11.11 of Neurobiology
and Ophthalmology
13.24 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.07 Today we are
discussing caffeine.
17.62 Caffeine is one of the
most widely used substances
20.08 on the planet.
21.4 Estimates are that more than
90% of adults and as many as 50%
25.84 of kids that is
adolescents and teenagers
28.48 use caffeine on a daily basis.
31.45 Caffeine is an amazing molecule.
33.43 Most people are familiar
with caffeine's ability
35.8 to increase alertness and
to reduce our feelings
39.01 of sleepiness and fatigue.
40.51 And indeed, it does that.
42.2 But what most people
are not aware of
44.14 is that caffeine acts
as a strong reinforcer.
47.23 What I mean by reinforcer
is that, when caffeine
49.9 is present in a drink or food--
51.88 and yes, indeed, caffeine
is present in many foods
55.15 even unbeknownst to us.
57.25 When it's present
in drinks and foods,
59.26 we actively come to like those
foods and drinks more than
63.85 if caffeine were not contained
in those foods and drinks.
67.24 So it reinforces our liking of
particular foods and drinks.
71.05 And indeed, it even
reinforces our liking
73.93 of the containers
they are consumed from
76.42 and the company we keep when we
consume foods and drinks that
80.77 contain caffeine.
82.06 That is, caffeine is
not just a stimulant.
84.82 Caffeine is a reinforcer.
86.83 And it's a reinforcer that
plays an active role in almost
90.49 everybody's daily life.
92.008 We can say that with confidence
because, as I mentioned
94.3 a moment ago, more than 90% of
people are consuming caffeine.
97.6 And most people think that they
consume caffeine because it
100.15 makes them feel more alert.
101.62 But there are many reasons
why you're consuming caffeine.
104.41 And I'm not going to tell you
that consuming caffeine is
106.93 necessarily bad.
107.87 In fact, today, I'm going
to tell you about many
109.96 of the positive health
benefits of caffeine,
112.06 including
neuroprotective effects,
114.49 antidepressive
effects, and certainly
116.74 performance-enhancing effects,
both for mental performance
120.19 and for physical performance.
121.877 Now that said, there are
certain situations in which you
124.21 want to avoid caffeine, and
there are certain people who
126.79 might opt to avoid caffeine.
128.645 That's especially the case
when one thinks about caffeine
131.02 not just as a stimulant
but as a reinforcer.
133.33 In fact, caffeine is
such a strong reinforcer
135.79 that, if even tiny
amounts of caffeine
137.83 are present in certain
foods and drinks,
140.08 you will very quickly
come to prefer those foods
142.57 and drinks over
other choices, which
144.19 can be a good thing
or a bad thing,
146.44 depending on what sorts
of food and drink choices
148.54 you're trying to make.
149.457 So today, I'm
going to inform you
151.12 about how caffeine works
at a mechanistic level.
153.76 I promise to do
that with a minimum
155.332 of nomenclature and such
that, even if you don't have
157.54 a background in
biology, you will
159.64 be able to digest that
information easily.
161.77 And then I'll tell you how to
use caffeine to your advantage
164.77 or conversely how to avoid
caffeine at certain times
168.64 to your advantage.
169.94 So today's episode will focus
both on mechanisms and tools
173.32 that is the use and
leverage of caffeine
175.75 to improve mental
health, physical health,
177.85 and performance.
178.63 Before we go any further
into today's discussion,
181.09 I want to tell you about some
recent results about a molecule
184.93 that's found in certain
caffeinated beverages
187.54 and that has been proven to
be very useful for both weight
191.02 loss, mental performance, and
controlling blood sugar levels.
194.65 And that's GLP-1 or
glucagon-like peptide 1.
198.43 Glucagon-like peptide 1 is
found in the brain and body.
202.75 It acts both on
the brain and body.
204.29 It does many different things.
205.54 But one of its primary
effects that's been discovered
208.06 is to reduce hunger.
209.11 And it does that in two ways.
211.0 It does that by
activating certain neurons
213.34 in your hypothalamus.
214.3 So that's a brain region that
controls hunger and satiety.
217.21 It makes us feel full at
the level of the brain,
219.86 so it makes us feel
sated, that is.
221.62 And it actually
makes us feel full.
223.84 It turns out that GLP-1 acts
on certain receptors in the gut
227.23 to make us feel as if
we've ingested enough food.
230.35 It doesn't necessarily
make us feel
232.0 as if our gut is distended,
but it makes us feel full.
234.462 That's really interesting
because, if you
236.17 think about it, when we eat,
our stomach fills up, obviously.
239.68 And that information has to be
communicated to the brain such
243.07 that the brain can then send
satiety signals that actually
246.22 shut off our hunger.
247.24 And believe it or not,
the brain actually
248.948 activates signals
to reduce the desire
251.02 to chew when our
stomach is full.
253.3 And GLP-1, as I mentioned,
works on the brain
256.57 to create these feelings of
satiety as if we've had enough
259.779 and to reduce our
desire to eat more.
261.94 And GLP-1 acts
directly on the gut
264.25 to give us a slight sense of
fullness in the gut, which then
267.58 is communicated to the brain.
268.79 So really, there are
two parallel signals
270.498 being sent when we have
GLP-1 present in our system.
273.55 Now a little bit of
relevant history on GLP-1.
275.77 It was actually discovered
in Gila monsters.
277.73 These are these reptiles that
can go long periods of time
281.35 without eating.
281.98 And a very clever
scientist decided
283.438 to study why it is that certain
animals like Gila monsters
287.38 can go a long period of time
without ingesting anything.
290.65 And it's because they produce
very large amounts of GLP-1.
294.7 They isolate the
peptide from GLP-1,
296.53 then they looked for the
analogous peptide in humans.
300.55 And it turns out
that does exist.
301.997 And as I mentioned, it's
released in both brain and body
304.33 to make you feel full and sated.
306.58 Why am I telling you all this?
307.83 Well, today we're going
to talk about caffeine.
309.48 And there's one particular
caffeine source,
311.56 which is yerba maté, and there
are some other forms of teas
314.82 similar to yerba mate that
stimulate the release of GLP-1
318.36 significantly.
319.86 There are also nowadays drugs
which are called analogues
323.34 of GLP-1.
324.24 So these are drugs
that mimic or are
327.15 identical to the kind of
GLP-1 that you would make.
329.932 And those drugs are proven
to be very effective
331.89 for the treatment of
certain forms of diabetes
334.02 and for the
treatment of obesity,
335.7 but they trigger
enormous amounts
337.08 of GLP-1 pathway activation.
339.0 So those are extreme cases
for people that are really
341.385 struggling for weight loss.
342.51 But the clinical trials and
the data that are out there
345.33 in the general
population now are very,
347.14 very promising for
GLP-1 analogues.
349.8 Yerba maté tea, provided
it's not the smoked variety--
353.85 and I mention that because a
number of people have cued me
356.88 to the fact that yerba maté
teas come in smoked varieties
360.5 and nonsmoked varieties.
361.5 And the smoked
varieties are thought
363.21 to perhaps be carcinogenic.
364.65 That is, procancer-causing.
366.93 So I advise people to avoid
smoked varieties of yerba maté
370.822 tea.
371.43 But yerba maté teas are known
to stimulate significant amounts
374.67 of GLP-1 release.
375.69 And so they can be effective
as a weight loss tool,
378.24 mainly by blunting appetite.
380.52 And again, they do that both
at the level of the brain
383.07 and at the level of the gut.
385.302 Now all of what I
just told you has
386.76 been known for some
period of time,
388.33 but there are new set of
findings that were just
390.33 published in Cell Reports
Medicine, Cell Press
392.34 journal, excellent journal--
394.05 which indicate exactly
how it is that GLP-1
397.59 stimulates both satiety and
can trigger additional weight
401.31 loss through other mechanisms.
403.23 And I find the mechanism to be
really interesting and actually
406.02 really important, given
some other topics we've
408.18 covered on this podcast before.
409.62 So the basic finding
is that GLP-1,
413.01 whether or not it's stimulated
through the release of analogue
416.61 drug that one is prescribed
or by drinking yerba maté tea,
420.27 for instance, and stimulate
release of your own so-called
422.85 endogenous GLP-1, yes, it makes
you feel more full at the level
427.02 of brain and body.
427.77 But it turns out it also
stimulates thermogenesis.
430.98 Now thermogenesis is
the active utilization
435.09 of more metabolic energy.
436.59 And fat cells, in particular--
so-called beige and brown fat
441.45 cells--
442.08 are a potent source of
thermogenic activity
444.3 in your body.
445.47 The basic background is that
you have white adipose cells, so
448.8 white fat cells.
450.21 You have beige fat cells,
and you have brown fat cells.
452.91 And the beige and brown
ones are fat cells
456.118 that you actually want more of.
457.41 They are not abundant
under your skin.
459.1 They're abundant really
around your clavicles
460.59 and your upper neck.
461.423 They are the ones
that generate heat.
463.11 And the beige and
brownness of them
465.72 is actually the consequence of
having a lot of mitochondria
468.36 in those cells.
469.68 When GLP-1 is elevated
in your system,
472.02 it turns out that
it communicates
473.58 to those white fat cells
and helps convert them
477.0 into beige and brown fat cells.
479.79 That is, it takes fat
cells that are not
481.77 doing anything useful for you
except being stored energy.
484.145 And I think most
people out there
485.52 would like to have fewer of
those white adipose cells.
488.247 There are few of you
out there that actually
490.08 need more of them that
are too thin, too lean,
492.12 but most people are suffering
from having too many
494.61 of these white adipose cells.
496.89 Well, when you ingest yerba maté
tea or you were to take a GLP-1
499.86 analogue or stimulate GLP-1 in
any number of different ways,
503.49 yes, you stimulate
increased satiety,
505.53 but you're also stimulating the
conversion of these white fat
509.46 cells into beige
and brown fat cells,
513.22 which makes you more thermogenic
and over time raises your basal
517.86 metabolic rate.
518.82 So you're burning more
calories even at rest.
520.86 It also makes you
feel as if you're
522.48 more comfortable in colder
environments at rest.
525.81 This is very much the same
as the mechanism that's
530.28 induced when you were to,
say, take a cold shower
533.07 or do regular ice baths or
get into cold water regularly.
535.92 That, too, stimulates the
conversion of white fat cells
538.74 to beige and brown fat cells.
540.42 So I like these
findings very much
541.92 because they provide a
mechanistic coherence.
544.86 They provide that is a
really nice story as to how
547.98 something like GLP-1 could be
so effective for weight loss.
551.1 Yes, on the one hand,
GLP-1 is reducing appetite,
554.55 and that, of course, will help
people maintain or lose weight.
557.88 But it's also increasing
basal metabolic rate.
560.173 And we now know how
that's accomplished.
561.84 It's likely accomplished
at least through this one
564.27 mechanism by the
stimulation of conversion
567.21 of these white fat cells,
which don't do much for us
569.7 except as energy storage
units to these metabolically
574.17 mitochondrial-rich beige
and brown fat cells,
576.828 which you can think of as
sort of the oil in the candle
579.12 that allows your furnace, your
metabolism to burn at a higher
583.05 temperature and a higher rate.
584.54 So that's the mechanism.
585.54 And the basic tool
takeaway is that,
587.25 if you are somebody who's
interested in losing weight
590.22 and you want to leverage
the GLP-1 pathway,
592.83 drinking a cup or two of yerba
maté tea early in the day would
597.24 be a great way to
stimulate GLP-1 release.
600.33 There are other ways to
stimulate GLP-1 release.
602.33 You can get it through
certain forms of exercise.
604.372 In particular, fasted exercise.
605.76 This is actually a vote in
favor of fasted exercise.
607.968 There's a debate as
to whether or not
609.51 fasted cardio burns more
fat than nonfasted cardio.
612.69 And the data basically say
no, it doesn't really matter.
615.81 But that doesn't really
take into account
618.03 the longer arc of things
like GLP-1 release,
620.46 so that needs to be
taken into consideration.
622.36 So you could do fasted cardio.
623.61 You could drink yerba maté tea,
keeping in mind that yerba maté
626.4 tea does contain caffeine.
627.82 We'll talk more about the
specific forms of stimulants
630.54 including caffeine
that maté has.
632.19 But maté would be a great way
to stimulate GLP-1 release.
635.455 And then, of course, for those
of you that are interested
637.83 in more robust
activation of GLP-1,
641.118 then perhaps you might want
to consider some of the new
643.41 prescription GLP-1 analogues
that are out there.
645.7 But that's a more severe
stimulus for GLP-1, of course.
648.608 And for everybody, regardless
of whether or not you're trying
651.15 to lose weight, gain
weight, or maintain weight,
653.28 I think we're going to be
hearing a lot more about GLP-1
656.04 analogues and drinks and
supplements and things of that
658.95 sort that stimulate GLP-1 in
the very near future because it
662.43 does appear to be a very
important biological mechanism.
665.88 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
667.712 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
670.17 roles at Stanford.
671.25 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
673.44 to bring zero cost to
consumer information
675.33 about science and
science-related tools
677.34 to the general public.
678.69 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
680.22 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
682.66 Our first sponsor is Levels.
684.42 Levels is a program
that lets you
685.95 see how different foods affect
your health by giving you
688.283 real-time feedback on your
diet using a continuous glucose
690.9 monitor.
691.77 The blood glucose or blood
sugar is a critical aspect
694.5 of your immediate and
long-term health and, indeed,
696.78 your feelings of vigor and
mental clarity and well-being
699.69 at any moment.
701.01 One of the key things is to know
how different foods and food
703.65 combinations and
timing of food intake
706.02 is impacting blood glucose.
707.79 And with Levels,
you're able to assess
709.71 all of that in real time.
711.81 I tried Levels,
and what it taught
713.507 me, for instance, was that
I can eat certain foods
715.59 at certain times of day.
716.82 But if I eat them at
other times a day,
718.77 I get a blood sugar crash.
720.42 It also taught me,
for instance, how
722.1 to space my exercise
and my food intake.
725.01 Turns out for me exercising
fasted is far more beneficial.
728.28 That's something I
learned using Levels,
730.05 and it's completely transformed
not just the spacing and timing
733.44 of my diet and
exercise but also use
736.35 of things like the sauna
and other activities.
738.54 It's been a tremendous
learning for me
740.52 that's really shaped an enormous
number of factors in my life
743.13 that have led to me feeling
far more vigorous with far more
746.31 mental focus and physical
strength and endurance.
749.172 So if you're interested in
learning more about Levels
751.38 and trying a continuous
glucose monitor yourself,
753.72 go to levels.link/huberman.
756.15 Again, that's
levels.link/huberman.
759.78 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
762.72 Eight Sleep make smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating,
765.45 and sleep-tracking capacity.
767.49 I've talked many
times on this podcast
769.44 about the critical relationship
between sleep and body
772.08 temperature.
773.07 That is, in order to fall
asleep and stay deeply asleep
776.21 throughout the night,
our body temperature
777.96 needs to drop by
about 1 to 3 degrees.
780.33 And conversely, when we
wake up in the morning,
783.0 that is in large part
because of our body
785.64 heating up by 1 to 3 degrees.
787.948 Now people have different
core body temperatures,
789.99 and they tend to run colder or
hotter throughout the night.
792.51 Eight Sleep allows you
to adjust the temperature
794.533 of your sleeping
environment so that you
796.2 have the optimal temperature
that gets you the best night's
798.75 sleep.
799.29 I started sleeping on
an Eight Sleep mattress
801.165 cover about eight months
ago, and it has completely
803.64 transformed my sleep.
804.78 I sleep so much deeper.
806.61 I wake up far less during the
middle of the night, if at all.
809.5 And I wake up feeling far
better than I ever have even
812.55 after the same amount of sleep.
814.01 If you want to try
Eight Sleep, you can go

828.36 and Australia.
829.56 Again, that's

832.26 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
834.69 ROKA makes eyeglasses
and sunglasses
836.94 that are of the absolute
highest quality.
839.07 The company was founded by
two all-American swimmers
841.26 from Stanford.
842.16 And everything about ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
844.68 were designed with
performance in mind.
846.72 I've spent a lifetime working on
the biology, the visual system.
849.61 And I can tell you that
your visual system has
851.13 to contend with an enormous
number of challenges in order
853.65 for you to see clearly,
for instance, when you move
855.775 from a sunny area
to a shady area
857.15 and back again, whether or not
you're looking at something up
859.692 close or often to the distance.
861.0 ROKA understands the
biology of the visual system
863.46 and has designed their
eyeglasses and sunglasses
865.65 accordingly, so you always
see with perfect clarity.
868.44 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses were initially
870.6 designed for activities
such as running and cycling.
873.847 And indeed, they are
very lightweight.
875.43 Most of the time I
can't even remember
876.84 that they're on my face.
877.77 They're so lightweight.
878.728 But the important thing to
know about ROKA eyeglasses
880.95 and sunglasses is
that, while they
882.6 can be used during
sports activities,
885.09 they also have a
terrific aesthetic,
887.16 and they can be used just as
well for wearing to work or out
890.76 to dinner, et cetera.
891.96 If you'd like to try ROKA

905.25 The Huberman Lab
podcast is now partnered
906.99 with Momentous supplements.
908.18 To find the supplements we
discuss on the Huberman Lab
910.43 podcast, you can go to
livemomentous, spelled O-U-S,
913.34 livemomentous.com/huberman.
915.2 Huberman.
915.7 And I should just
mention that the library
917.45 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
919.49 Again, that's
livemomentous.com/huberman.
922.55 Let's talk about caffeine.
924.572 So as I mentioned
earlier, caffeine
926.03 is consumed by basically most
all adults every single day
930.41 and consumed at very
regular times each day.
934.77 In fact, if you were to take
a look at your caffeine intake
937.79 or the caffeine intake
of somebody close
939.47 to you, what you
would realize is
941.24 that they don't do so well if
their caffeine intake arrives
945.83 even 10, 20, or 30 minutes past
their expected or usual intake
951.77 of caffeine.
952.97 That's pretty
remarkable, and it brings
954.89 to mind ideas that
we are all, quote
957.02 unquote, "addicted to caffeine"
or that caffeine is somehow
959.78 bad.
960.628 I'm certainly not going to make
the argument that caffeine is
963.17 bad.
963.67 First of all, I'm a
regular caffeine user.
965.452 I wouldn't call myself
a caffeine abuser,
967.16 but I am a regular
caffeine user.
968.99 And caffeine is known to
have certain health benefits.
972.06 I listed off a few
of them earlier,
973.64 but I'll mention those again
now before going forward.
977.33 Caffeine is known to have
certain neuroprotective
980.6 effects.
981.3 And that is because
of its ability
983.15 to increase neuromodulators,
such as dopamine,
986.57 but also other
so-called catecholamines
988.73 like norepinephrine.
989.66 If you don't know
what those names mean,
990.83 these are molecules that
increase levels of alertness,
993.35 motivation, and drive.
994.85 And so then therefore not
surprisingly the large scale
997.94 analyses of the relationship
between depression and caffeine
1001.57 shows that, provided people are
not drinking so much caffeine,
1004.24 that it makes them
overly anxious,
1006.64 that regular intake of
caffeine is inversely related
1010.93 to levels of depression.
1012.5 So it may have some
antidepressant effects.
1014.567 And those could be
direct or indirect.
1016.15 What do I mean by that?
1017.09 Well, you can imagine that if
people are ingesting caffeine
1019.548 and they are more motivated
to do work and pursue
1021.73 quality social
interactions, then
1023.59 the probability that they will
have depression could be lower.
1027.68 It could also be that
there are direct effects
1029.65 on the chemical systems
of the brain that
1031.482 relate to mood and well-being
that could offset depression.
1033.94 It is not clear whether
or not the effects
1036.52 of caffeine in
countering depression
1038.68 are direct or indirect.
1039.73 Nonetheless, there's
a relationship there,
1041.56 and it's an interesting
and positive one.
1044.95 Or I should say
negative correlation,
1047.03 positive effect overall on mood
and well-being, to be exact.
1052.73 Now it's also the
case that caffeine
1054.49 can improve mental performance
and physical performance.
1057.7 This has been demonstrated in
tens of thousands of studies.
1060.94 I will review a few studies
on this, in particular, today.
1063.49 But to just give
you a sense of how
1064.96 caffeine works at the level
of its timing and impact
1068.44 on mental performance and
physical performance, when
1071.08 we ingest caffeine,
provided that we don't have
1073.33 a lot of food in our stomach
and that our blood sugar isn't
1077.17 particularly high, generally,
we experience an increase
1080.32 in alertness within
about five minutes.
1082.18 And that increase in
focus and alertness peaks
1084.82 around 30 minutes after
ingestion of caffeine
1087.52 and persists for as
long as 60 minutes.
1090.32 Now this is assuming that one
takes caffeine in pill form
1093.19 or drinks the entire
caffeine drink
1095.14 within a short period of time.
1096.405 But a little bit
later, I'll talk
1097.78 about how you can consume
caffeine at regular intervals
1101.68 while doing mental work or
physical work in a way that
1104.2 can further increase
mental performance
1106.3 and physical performance.
1107.68 But let's just touch
on what caffeine
1109.48 intake really does
for mental performance
1111.19 and physical performance.
1112.96 Perhaps the most robust
finding across all
1116.29 of the studies
that I've examined
1117.88 is that caffeine reduces
our reaction time.
1121.3 That is, it improves
our reaction time.
1123.367 It doesn't make it longer.
1124.45 It makes it shorter.
1125.36 So for instance, in
a laboratory study
1127.03 where people were asked to hit
a lever every time they hear
1130.36 a tone, you can greatly reduce
the time between the tone
1134.5 and the pressing of the lever
if people ingest caffeine
1137.35 about 30 minutes before
they do that task.
1140.122 Now that seems like
a trivial task,
1141.58 but this is also seen in the
domain of sports performance
1144.7 and even in cognitive
performance, where
1147.16 people have to arrive
at a particular answer
1149.56 to a question.
1150.62 And the answer to
that question has
1152.32 to be pulled from
their memory banks
1154.307 within their brain,
their hippocampus,
1155.89 for instance, a brain
structure involved in memory.
1158.48 And if you are asking
people, for instance,
1161.05 to remember the capitals of
different states or cities
1164.92 or to remember certain
historical facts,
1167.92 they will do that at
a particular rate.
1169.84 But if they've ingested
caffeine within the hour prior,
1173.68 their ability to
recall that information
1175.99 is much, much better.
1177.1 They are faster, and
it does not appear
1179.23 that accuracy is reduced.
1180.46 In fact, in many cases,
accuracy is enhanced.
1183.49 And that's because caffeine
both works on the reaction time
1187.45 systems of the brain and body.
1189.387 I'll talk about the mechanisms
for that in a little bit.
1191.72 But it also stimulates
certain neurotransmitters
1195.05 and so-called neuromodulators
within the brain and body
1197.74 that give the neural
circuits in the brain that
1200.98 are associated with
learning and memory a lower
1204.66 threshold to activation.
1205.86 What does that mean?
1206.74 That means that we are
better able to access
1209.61 the brain circuitry involved
in learning and memory
1212.22 when we have a certain amount
of caffeine circulating
1214.65 in our system.
1215.44 So this makes
caffeine an incredible
1217.2 performance-enhancing compound.
1219.39 And I could give you
tens of thousands
1220.98 of examples of this in humans.
1223.26 But before I do that,
I want to just touch
1226.08 on what we know about the
existence of caffeine in nature
1229.89 and what the existence
of caffeine in nature
1232.47 and its effects on other
animals tells us about what
1235.2 caffeine does in humans.
1236.61 Because as I alluded to
earlier, what caffeine is doing
1240.96 for us is not just
making us more alert,
1244.05 improving our memory, improving
our reaction time, and so on.
1248.23 It's actually acting as
a powerful reinforcer
1251.19 of experience.
1252.67 And it's acting as not
just a powerful reinforcer
1255.54 of the caffeine-containing
drink that we drink
1258.63 but also the mug that
it's contained in,
1261.72 plus the person that
we might be sitting
1263.67 across from when we consume
that caffeine, and so on and so
1266.76 forth.
1267.31 If it's a little
bit hard for you
1268.685 to conceptualize
what a reinforcer is
1271.62 and why I'm calling
it a reinforcer,
1274.62 let me spell it out in
three specific ways.
1278.55 We often hear about
the word reward,
1280.53 and we think, OK, if
we do certain things
1282.96 and we like the outcome,
then those certain things
1285.63 are rewarded.
1286.36 Right?
1286.86 If we're doing something,
we receive praise.
1289.148 The praise is the reward.
1290.19 And therefore, we
are more likely to do
1291.93 that thing in the future.
1293.25 In fact, a lot of
parenting is like that.
1295.47 And a lot of life is like that.
1297.76 However, when we
hear the word reward,
1300.09 we often think about something
that feels good to us.
1302.7 And certainly, if we've worked
hard and we get some praise,
1305.41 that's natural for the
praise to feel good to us.
1308.22 Or for instance, if
we work very hard
1311.28 and we get a certain outcome--
1313.77 a trophy, a financial outcome,
a degree outcome, recognition,
1318.33 et cetera-- all of those
can act as rewards,
1320.49 but those are all
conscious rewards.
1322.98 We are aware that
they are happening.
1325.32 Reinforcers are a little bit
different because the word
1327.87 reinforcement can apply to
conscious rewards of the sort
1330.9 that I just described,
but there are also
1332.94 many ways in which
caffeine stimulates
1334.59 the release of chemicals in our
body that act as reinforcers.
1338.35 But those reinforcers
are subconscious.
1341.1 That is, we are
not aware that they
1343.8 cause this preference
for the activities that
1347.67 cause their release.
1348.84 So the study I'm about
to describe beautifully,
1352.08 I believe,
encapsulates how is it
1354.87 that humans came
to consume caffeine
1357.33 and why caffeine exists in
nature and the powerful effects
1361.08 of caffeine as a reinforcing
agent both in animals, insects,
1365.58 and in you and me.
1366.57 And the title of the
paper is "Caffeine
1368.22 and floral nectar enhances a
pollinator's memory of reward."
1371.79 Keep in mind that caffeine
is made from plants.
1374.128 Some of you will say, duh,
but I think some of us
1376.17 don't realize that the reason
why there is caffeine in coffee
1380.19 is because coffee
comes from a plant.
1381.76 It's a coffee
bean, certain teas,
1383.7 which, of course, are
plants that people brew.
1387.26 Caffeine is contained in those
teas, such as yerba maté.
1391.07 Well, why would this
bitter substance-- because,
1394.31 in fact, caffeine is quite
bitter in high concentrations.
1396.827 Why would this bitter
substance be something
1398.66 that insects or animals
would want to consume at all?
1401.16 It turns out that,
in most plants,
1402.92 caffeine is present in
small enough quantities
1406.46 that insects and other animals--
and in fact, we can't actually
1409.7 taste the caffeine.
1410.503 If I were to give you a
little bit of pure caffeine,
1412.67 yes, it would be a
stimulant for you,
1415.16 but you would say
that it tasted awful.
1417.448 It's in a category of compounds
that would strongly stimulate
1419.99 the bitter receptors
on your tongue
1422.48 and would make you
cringe and pucker
1424.85 and essentially walk away from
whatever it is that contain
1427.91 that caffeine and from
the experience that
1430.52 contain that caffeine.
1431.63 Well, in nature, caffeine
is present in very low
1434.33 concentrations or is
masked by other flavors
1438.56 within flowers,
beans, and plants.
1442.25 And what this paper
really points to
1444.5 is that caffeine
in nature is acting
1447.35 as a reinforcer for bees that
are consuming different nectar.
1451.548 So the way that it works
is that bees, of course,
1453.59 go from flower to flower, and
they are consuming the nectar.
1457.43 They are bringing nectar
and pollen back to the hive,
1461.48 and that provides critical
nourishment for the bee colony.
1466.91 The bees are foraging in a
way that includes information
1471.272 about color, in particular,
ultraviolet color, things
1473.48 that we can't see
but they can see,
1474.74 because they have different
photoreceptors than we do.
1476.99 And what the study shows is
that plants and nectars that
1481.71 contain very small
amounts of caffeine
1485.4 are the preferred
sources of food for bees.
1489.36 And the study is
beautiful because they
1491.73 were able to confirm that they
could mask the caffeine taste.
1494.445 So they know that the
bees are not preferring
1496.32 the taste of caffeine.
1497.88 But what they do is
they pair caffeine
1499.47 with different food
sources for the bees,
1501.178 then they remove the caffeine.
1502.68 And what they find is that
the bees very strongly
1504.99 prefer flavors that
contain caffeine,
1508.23 not because they could taste the
caffeine but rather for the way
1512.1 that those caffeine-containing
flavors made the bees feel.
1516.81 So how do those
caffeine-containing flavors
1520.53 make the bees feel?
1521.598 The same way that
they make you and I
1523.14 feel, a little bit
more alert and thereby
1526.47 able to do more work.
1527.97 For the bee, the more
work is the consumption
1530.46 of more food, which then has
a further reinforcing effect.
1534.595 So what we're really
talking about here
1536.22 is the fact that A, caffeine
exists in nature, in plants.
1540.69 It exists in concentrations that
are very low, so low, in fact,
1544.18 that they are not detectable to
the taste receptors of insects,
1547.23 and, in many cases, to the
taste receptors of humans.
1549.883 And, of course, there
can be high levels
1551.55 of caffeine in a plant.
1552.72 But if the plant also
contains compounds
1555.3 that mask the
flavor of caffeine,
1557.19 well then, those plants
are going to essentially
1560.28 be even stronger reinforcers
for the flavor of the plant, OK?
1563.77 So now we're talking
about strong flavors
1565.5 plus strong neurostimulant
effects of caffeine.
1569.25 And the most
important point here
1571.56 is that all of these effects
of caffeine are subconscious.
1575.34 It is not because the bee or
you likes the taste of caffeine.
1580.62 In fact, most people, when they
take their first sip of coffee,
1583.38 they find it taste bitter
and kind of noxious.
1586.41 They don't like it.
1587.31 You may not even remember that
because it happened so long ago
1590.44 and because caffeine is
such a strong reinforcer
1592.44 that very quickly you come
to like the taste of coffee.
1596.31 You might even come to like
the feeling of your mug
1599.52 in your hand.
1600.49 You might even come to
like the smell of coffee
1603.09 and so on and so forth.
1604.51 And that's because
caffeine stimulates
1606.54 the release of certain
neurochemicals in the brain,
1608.79 in particular, dopamine
and acetylcholine,
1611.64 two neuromodulators
that increase our focus
1614.58 and alertness and our
feelings of well-being.
1616.565 A little bit later,
I'll tell you
1617.94 that caffeine stimulates
the release of dopamine
1620.61 in a way that's
very much distinct
1622.71 from the classical
dopamine pathway associated
1625.26 with addiction and reward.
1626.46 In fact, we can
think of caffeine
1627.835 as having a somewhat privileged
access to the reward systems.
1631.962 I'll give you a bit of a
hint of where this is going.
1634.17 Caffeine stimulates the release
of dopamine and acetylcholine
1637.68 not within the classic so-called
mesolimbic reward pathway.
1641.04 That's just fancy nerd
speak for the reward
1642.973 pathways of the brain.
1643.89 They're associated with
things like sex and food
1646.05 and drugs of abuse, like
cocaine and methamphetamine.
1648.75 But rather, caffeine
seems to stimulate
1651.36 the release of dopamine in
the parts of the brain that
1653.85 are associated with
alertness and cognition,
1656.94 meaning the forebrain.
1658.83 This is very important.
1660.19 We have multiple dopamine
systems in the brain and body,
1662.58 and caffeine seems to
stimulate dopamine directly
1665.28 within the components of the
brain that are associated
1667.92 with clarity of
thought and well-being,
1671.1 but more so clarity of thought.
1673.32 Now, I'm also talking
about caffeine
1676.02 as a strong reinforcer in that
it makes you feel good overall.
1681.93 And it does.
1682.768 And that suggests that it
also taps into the more
1684.81 classic reward pathway.
1686.16 But it does that in a very
interesting and frankly almost
1688.95 diabolical way.
1690.42 When we regularly
ingest caffeine,
1692.49 it stimulates the increase
in dopamine receptors
1696.27 at multiple sites throughout
the brain but, in particular,
1698.94 within the reward
pathways of the brain.
1700.72 So not the areas
of the brain that
1701.76 are associated with focus
and clarity of thought
1703.76 and cognition.
1704.52 It does that, but it
is also increasing
1707.76 the level of dopamine receptors
in the reward pathway.
1711.33 And what that means is that,
for any dopamine that's
1713.85 released in response to
a positive experience,
1716.13 social experience, or any
number of the other things
1718.86 that can stimulate
dopamine release,
1721.26 there are more receptors,
more parking spots,
1724.3 if you will, for that
dopamine to arrive at
1726.66 and to exert its increases in
mood, increases in motivation,
1731.7 and overall feelings of
drive and excitement.
1735.41 So there are four ways
that caffeine works
1737.16 that we need to understand.
1738.285 First of all, caffeine acts
as a reinforcing agent.
1741.78 It increases the
probability that you
1743.85 will return to and engage
in a certain activity
1747.06 or consume a certain
beverage or food.
1749.49 Second of all,
caffeine increases
1752.49 dopamine and
acetylcholine, which
1754.59 are both neuromodulators
in the forebrain, which
1757.32 helps us improve our ability to
think, to modify our rule sets.
1762.69 That is, to adjust
our strategies
1764.76 for different social
situations and mental demands
1767.52 and physical demands.
1769.47 And third, it increases
the number and efficacy
1773.13 of dopamine receptors in the
reward pathways of the brain.
1776.91 That is, it makes things
that would feel pretty good
1780.27 feel even better.
1782.28 And fourth, caffeine
acts as an antagonist
1784.74 to adenosine, which offsets
the sleepiness that we would
1788.76 otherwise feel from the
accumulation of adenosine that
1791.46 occurs as we are awake
for more and more hours
1793.83 throughout the day.
1794.68 So let's talk first
about caffeine
1796.097 as a reinforcing agent.
1797.7 Again, this was first most
beautifully demonstrated
1800.94 in this study on honeybees
where the bees prefer
1803.79 nectars that contain caffeine.
1805.77 And that all makes
perfect sense in terms
1807.6 of the ecology of bees and
flowers that contain nectar.
1811.44 There's an advantage, at
least in terms of adaptation,
1814.17 that the flower benefits because
of distribution of things
1817.05 from the flower, which is good
for the flowers and the bees
1819.66 benefit, because
they're getting food.
1821.34 And so there's a kind
of a symbiosis there.
1824.13 But with humans, we're consuming
caffeine-containing beverages
1827.88 for our sake.
1828.57 I don't think we
have it in mind,
1829.982 nor do the bees have
it in mind, frankly,
1831.69 that we're trying to
preserve the plants that
1833.565 provide the caffeine.
1834.66 I think we would all suffer,
or I should say 90% of adults
1838.74 would suffer greatly if all
the caffeine-containing coffee
1841.68 and tea plants were
gone, certainly.
1843.69 But most of us are not
consuming coffees and teas
1846.87 and caffeine-containing
foods because we're
1848.73 thinking about the
plants they come from
1850.24 and we want to
help those plants.
1851.19 We're thinking about how
we want to help ourselves.
1853.315 And yet the point of the
reinforcing effects of caffeine
1857.07 are that they are
largely subconscious.
1859.59 We are not aware of them.
1861.445 Now you might say,
no, that's not true.
1863.07 When I drink caffeine, it
makes me feel really good.
1865.237 So I'm aware that it
makes me feel good.
1868.05 In order to illustrate how
reinforcement really works,
1871.54 let me give you the
counter example, which
1873.99 would be an aversive agent.
1876.04 So we have reinforcing agents
and we have aversive agents.
1878.64 Let's say that there were
compounds in nature that exist
1882.27 in plants that are aversive.
1884.19 And indeed, they are.
1885.09 And let's say that
these compounds
1886.86 were present at such
low concentrations
1888.9 that you couldn't taste them.
1890.61 Let's say you wake
up in the morning
1892.11 and you go to your
refrigerator and you open it up
1894.24 and you are thirsty,
and so you reach
1896.28 for a nice rich red-containing
beverage in a glass jar.
1900.48 Maybe it looks like
cranberry juice or something
1902.82 of that sort.
1903.51 Or even a nice clear
glass of water.
1906.148 It looks like a jug of
water or a glass of water,
1908.19 and you drink that.
1909.75 Taste fine to you.
1910.56 Maybe even tastes great to you.
1912.78 And then let's say
about 30 minutes later,
1914.95 you feel a little queasy,
you feel a little off,
1917.25 you feel like going
back to sleep,
1918.667 you just don't feel very good.
1920.61 You don't know why,
but your nervous system
1925.05 is a predictive machine, and it
has a process in which it back
1930.0 integrates.
1931.59 Or I should say
integrates backwards
1933.15 into your immediate experience
that preceded that not so
1936.3 good feeling.
1937.78 We can reliably say that there
is a much lower probability
1941.56 that the next day
when you wake up
1943.27 that you would reach
for that same beverage
1946.9 or for that same container even.
1949.15 And maybe if you're in
a novel environment,
1951.455 maybe you're staying in an
Airbnb or a hotel or something
1953.83 of that sort, you might even
find that you don't really
1956.29 like the kitchen in which
you consume that beverage
1959.41 in the first place.
1960.49 And you don't know why.
1962.2 And unless you got very,
very sick the day before,
1965.53 it's unlikely that you would
have such a strong response
1968.26 that you would entirely avoid,
for instance, water or glass
1970.96 jars containing
liquids, et cetera.
1972.97 Let's say you went back
to the refrigerator
1975.58 and you consume a beverage
again and you just
1977.74 didn't feel so well,
you felt less good
1980.02 than you normally would.
1981.93 Well, even without
any ability to taste
1985.71 what's in that beverage and
even without any understanding
1988.98 of what was happening to
you at a conscious level,
1991.89 there is a very,
very high probability
1994.59 that you will avoid drinking
that particular beverage
1997.41 and certainly at that location
and in the same volume
2001.73 in the subsequent days.
2003.08 That's just the way that
aversive agents work.
2005.03 And they work by way
of activating neurons
2007.1 in the gut that communicate with
areas in the brain that give us
2010.34 this feeling of queasiness.
2012.05 And for some of
you hearing this,
2014.12 that pathway and
that association
2017.0 with times in which you felt
queasy and as if you wanted
2019.67 to vomit is so powerful that
you might even be feeling
2024.8 some of that symptomology now.
2027.47 For certain people that's going
to be increased salivation
2030.36 which precedes vomiting,
we know that there's
2032.3 a class of neurons
in the brain relate
2034.25 to an area called area postrema
that actually stimulates
2036.98 vomiting.
2037.68 And if I keep
talking about this,
2038.63 I'll probably feel
like I want to vomit,
2039.86 so I'm going to move on
from this in a moment.
2041.61 So when we ingest
caffeine-containing beverages
2043.64 and foods, it's the
exact opposite scenario
2046.07 as to what I just described.
2047.69 Caffeine, as a
reinforcer, makes us
2051.11 feel slightly better
or a lot better
2054.17 in the immediate minutes and
hours after we ingest it.
2058.11 So it's acting as
a reinforcing agent
2060.5 not just while you are under
the effects of caffeine
2063.59 but for the things that preceded
the ingestion of caffeine,
2066.659 which is why you
return again and again
2068.78 to caffeine-containing
beverages, such as coffee
2071.33 and tea or maybe even foods
that contain caffeine,
2074.25 even if the taste of those
foods is not something
2076.639 that you would otherwise
consider, especially delicious.
2080.179 In fact, most people when they
take their first sip of coffee
2083.15 or tea or other
caffeine-containing beverage,
2085.25 they find it to be very bitter.
2086.75 And that's not because
of the taste of caffeine.
2089.06 It's because of the taste of
the beverage itself independent
2092.48 of caffeine.
2093.56 However, when caffeine
is present in there,
2096.02 they come to prefer that
taste over most all tastes.
2100.97 In fact, they will, as
I mentioned earlier,
2103.0 will invest a lot of financial
resources and time and energy
2105.5 to make sure that they
get that beverage.
2107.3 What they're trying to make sure
is not that they get that taste
2111.29 but that they get the caffeine.
2113.42 It is that positively
reinforcing.
2115.67 And the taste therefore takes on
new significance, new meaning,
2119.84 and we come to associate
it as positive.
2121.88 And in fact, most of
us, including myself,
2124.13 love the taste of espresso,
love the taste of coffee,
2126.56 love the taste of yerba maté
even if the initial taste,
2130.67 the very first time that
we consume that beverage,
2133.64 was either neutral or negative.
2136.02 And that is all because of
the reinforcing properties
2138.44 of caffeine.
2139.1 And then, of course, there
are the more direct actions
2141.38 of caffeine.
2142.22 That is, the faster
actions of caffeine.
2144.59 And just to list those off
again very briefly so that you
2147.5 have them in mind going
forward, caffeine also
2150.95 increases the release of
dopamine and acetylcholine,
2153.59 both of which are
neuromodulators
2155.06 in the forebrain, which
increases clarity of thought
2158.54 and your ability to rule
switch, your ability
2162.11 to move from one
context to another
2164.54 and change and understand
the rules of engagement,
2167.69 social engagement, physical
engagement, mental engagement,
2171.39 and so forth.
2172.26 And as I mentioned
before, caffeine also
2173.99 increases the number of
dopamine receptors in the reward
2177.53 pathway, such that any good
thing that happens to you.
2180.74 Any positive experience
that you have
2182.96 will have a more potent effect
on your feelings of well-being.
2187.04 And last but certainly
not least, caffeine
2190.85 acts as an adenosine antagonist.
2192.92 It reduces your feelings
of lethargy and fatigue
2197.3 and your desire to
sleep by parking
2199.58 in the receptors for
adenosine and not
2201.62 allowing adenosine to have
its pro-sleepy, if you will,
2205.43 effects on your brain and body.
2207.06 I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge
2209.18 one of our sponsors,
2210.17 Athletic Greens.
2211.34 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
is a vitamin mineral probiotic
2215.66 drink that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
2218.99 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012,
2221.78 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2224.03 The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason
2226.447 I still take Athletic Greens
once or usually twice a day
2229.55 is that it gets
me the probiotics
2231.65 that I need for gut health.
2233.27 Our gut is very important.
2234.41 It's populated by
gut microbiota that
2236.92 communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically
2239.42 all the biological
systems of our body
2241.16 to strongly impact our
immediate and long-term health.
2244.67 And those probiotics
and Athletic Greens
2246.62 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
2250.403 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number
2252.32 of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals
2253.94 that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs
2256.58 are met.
2257.21 And it tastes great.
2259.178 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,
2260.72 you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2263.93 and they'll give you five
free travel packs that make it
2266.48 really easy to mix up
Athletic Greens while
2268.467 you're on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera.
2270.8 And they'll give you a year
supply of Vitamin D3K2.
2274.4 Again, that's
athleticsgreen.com/huberman
2277.01 to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply
2279.59 of Vitamin D3K2.
2281.47 I'd like to just briefly
talk about adenosine and some
2284.11 of its molecular features.
2286.912 And again, if you don't have
a background in biology,
2289.12 don't worry.
2289.67 I promise to make this
very clear to everyone.
2292.94 First of all, caffeine is
what's called a methylxantine.
2296.23 It's a plant alkaloid.
2297.52 That's why caffeine
itself is very bitter.
2299.545 Again, if I were to give
you just the tiniest
2301.42 little bit of pure
caffeine, you would find
2303.85 it to be extremely aversive.
2306.1 So these plants that have
snuck small enough amounts
2308.56 of caffeine into
them or that have
2310.57 masked the flavor of
caffeine with other flavors
2313.36 such that bees and humans
want to consume them,
2316.0 while we don't know what
plants think, it does
2318.22 seem very diabolical
and very clever
2320.62 in that we are seeking out these
caffeine-containing plants,
2324.7 beverages, and foods even
though caffeine itself
2327.88 is this alkaloid that
is very, very bitter.
2331.24 Methylxantine--
that is caffeine--
2334.87 binds to adenosine receptors.
2336.28 And there are really two
types of adenosine receptors.
2338.53 There are these so-called A1
receptors and the A2 receptors.
2341.47 And they are present in
different parts of the brain
2343.637 and body at different levels.
2345.23 We don't have to get too
far into receptor subtypes.
2347.53 More importantly
to understand is
2349.72 that adenosine makes us feel
tired because of the way
2353.26 that it taps into
the ATP pathway.
2357.76 The ATP pathway is central to
energy production and feelings
2361.72 of overall energy in
our brain and body
2363.61 in all cells and organ systems.
2366.37 When caffeine binds to
adenosine receptors,
2369.37 it prevents adenosine
from breaking down
2372.31 certain components of the
energy production pathway.
2375.43 And the net consequence of
that is increased cyclic AMP.
2379.18 So basically, when
we ingest caffeine,
2382.15 we are biasing
our system towards
2384.1 the pro-energetic aspects
of these cellular pathways.
2387.61 Now it's really important to
understand that, in biology,
2391.27 even if you block a
receptor or you prevent
2393.61 the activity of an enzyme and--
2395.583 at least, in this
case, you end up
2397.0 with more cyclic
AMP, more energy.
2399.37 You're not really
getting more energy.
2401.41 You're actually borrowing
energy against an overall system
2406.03 that is frankly nonnegotiable.
2408.34 What do I mean by that?
2409.34 Well, let's say that you were
to wake up after six or eight
2412.99 hours of sleep and to
drink a lot of caffeine
2416.71 and keep drinking caffeine
throughout the day blocking
2419.62 those adenosine receptors.
2420.76 Yes, you'll offset fatigue.
2423.52 You'll offset sleepiness
because that adenosine simply
2426.25 can't function.
2427.39 But at the point where the
caffeine becomes dislodged
2431.02 from the adenosine
receptors, you
2433.6 will have a massive glut,
a backlog of adenosine,
2438.16 and you will feel
extra, extra sleepy.
2440.62 So really, there's no
way to create more energy
2443.17 in your system.
2443.89 Really, what you're
doing is you're
2445.6 changing the timing in which
the sleepy signals and the more
2449.08 energetic signals are arriving.
2451.15 And this is really important
to understand as the backdrop
2454.288 to the various tools
that we're going
2455.83 to get into next, in which you
can use caffeine for enhancing
2459.61 mental performance and
physical performance
2461.5 and other aspects of health.
2463.4 But it's very important
to understand this concept
2466.27 that, when you wake up in the
morning provided that you slept
2470.48 well and enough
the night before,
2472.76 your levels of adenosine
will be about as
2475.588 low as they will ever be.
2476.63 Actually, in order to get
your adenosine levels really
2479.84 bottomed out, you want to avoid
caffeine in the first 90 to 120
2482.895 minutes after waking.
2483.77 We'll talk about why that
is because it turns out
2485.812 there's a way to
completely clear adenosine
2487.61 out of your system in the
hour or so after waking.
2490.85 But for most people,
adenosine levels
2493.07 are going to be
close to their lowest
2494.96 after a good night's sleep.
2497.02 But there's really no
negotiating the accumulation
2499.99 of adenosine that's
going to occur
2502.36 and going to bias you towards
feeling more sleepy than you
2505.28 would.
2505.78 Otherwise, that's going to
occur throughout the day.
2507.85 There's really no way
to eliminate adenosine.
2509.77 All you can really do
is block its function.
2511.64 So it's sort of like borrowing
energy against the fatigue
2514.6 that you will inevitably feel.
2516.07 Now this actually
has a very important
2517.99 socioeconomical relevance.
2522.28 Before caffeine was regularly
consumed by human beings,
2526.06 we were really slaves
to the light/dark cycle.
2530.05 And this was especially
true before the presence
2532.45 of artificial lighting.
2533.68 But even before the advent
of artificial lighting,
2536.59 humans were largely constrained
to the outside light/dark
2540.89 cycle.
2541.39 We need to be active during the
day and working during the day,
2544.015 and we need to be
asleep at night.
2545.68 Caffeine allows us
to divorce ourselves
2547.87 from that circadian cycle.
2549.25 Circadian just
means about 24 hour.
2551.68 Caffeine allows us to do
that at least somewhat by way
2555.19 of increasing our alertness.
2556.9 That is, spiking our
alertness at various times
2559.69 throughout the day
and even at night.
2561.232 This is how we can have
shift workers, for instance,
2563.398 that can sleep during
the day and then drink
2565.3 a strong cup of
coffee at 8:00 PM
2567.22 and then work into the night.
2568.51 That ability completely
transformed our society.
2572.41 Now, of course, the
healthiest schedule-- and we
2574.698 know this with certainty.
2575.74 The healthiest schedule
for brain and body
2578.14 is going to be alert during the
daytime and asleep at night.
2580.868 There's no question about that.
2582.16 Shift workers run into all
sorts of health problems.
2584.68 And thank you shift workers
for doing the important work
2586.63 that you do.
2587.15 We need you.
2588.04 Air traffic controllers,
paramedics, firefighters,
2590.15 police officers, et cetera.
2591.4 But we know that there are
serious health consequences,
2595.4 negative health consequences,
that is, for shift workers.
2598.13 But for most people out
there, about 95% of people
2601.87 follow a typical schedule.
2603.01 They're awake during the
day and asleep at night.
2605.052 And yet it used to
be before the advent
2607.047 of caffeine-containing
beverages that, if you were
2609.13 sleepy in the
afternoon, you either
2611.23 had to take a nap or
battle that sleepiness,
2613.57 that your activity rhythms
and your sleep rhythms were
2616.9 governed by these circadian
changes in availability
2622.75 of sunlight and when you slept.
2625.51 And you just didn't
have the ability
2627.52 to ingest a beverage
that would increase
2629.65 your levels of alertness
because you block adenosine.
2631.923 So this is important
to understand
2633.34 that, nowadays,
we certainly live
2635.08 in a time in which we use--
2637.24 in fact, 90% or more of
adults and half or more
2640.87 of adolescents and
teenagers use caffeine
2643.57 as a way to negotiate
with, to borrow
2646.72 against this natural pattern
of adenosine making us sleepy.
2651.01 But again, you're
just offsetting
2652.39 the effects of sleepiness
that adenosine causes.
2655.07 You can't eliminate
the adenosine entirely.
2657.61 The important point
is that adenosine
2659.47 as a pro-sleep molecule
is a nonnegotiable aspect
2663.7 of your biology.
2664.99 In fact, it's so nonnegotiable
that, every 24 hours, you
2668.59 are going to release
adenosine, and you're
2671.05 going to release adenosine in
direct proportion to how long
2673.72 you've been awake.
2674.47 So the longer you've
been awake, the more
2676.178 adenosine circulating
in your system.
2677.78 There are really only a handful
of ways to completely clear out
2681.04 adenosine.
2681.85 The major one
being to get sleep.
2684.8 The other is to take a short
nap, which, of course, is
2687.5 sleep, but it's shallow sleep.
2689.15 Or non-sleep deep
rest, so-called NSDR,
2691.7 has been shown to reduce
levels of adenosine.
2694.73 And there are certain things
such as viewing morning
2698.92 sunlight, which because of
its effects on cortisol,
2701.47 can quote unquote,
"clear out adenosine."
2703.78 We'll talk about this in
more detail in a few minutes.
2706.09 And there's also evidence that
certain forms of exercise,
2710.02 provided that it's
brief and intense,
2712.36 can also reduce adenosine,
not just block its effects.
2716.238 Now that we've talked about some
of the incredible mechanisms
2718.78 by which caffeine changes
our experience of life,
2721.6 increases alertness
and mood, et cetera,
2723.91 I want to talk about the
use of caffeine as a tool.
2727.03 Now caffeine is a very
potent and useful tool
2730.24 for enhancing mental
health, physical health,
2732.31 and performance.
2733.39 But there are certain
considerations
2735.07 one has to keep in mind,
in particular, dose.
2738.28 Now, first off,
not everybody will
2740.68 respond to the same dose
of caffeine the same way,
2743.41 but we can reliably say
that your body weight is
2747.61 a good measure by
which you can estimate
2750.34 what a healthy, useful
dose of caffeine would be.
2754.33 So for most people,
ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams
2757.78 of caffeine per
kilogram of body weight
2760.72 is going to be the
range in which caffeine
2763.15 can have positive effects
without making us feel overly
2767.11 anxious and give us that
feeling that we're jumping out
2770.53 of our skin and
turn the otherwise
2772.63 positive experience of
caffeine into an aversive one.
2776.54 For those of you that aren't
familiar with thinking in terms
2779.04 of kilograms and
normally think in pounds,
2781.5 I'll just quickly give you
some general estimations
2785.19 that, for instance, 100
kilograms equals 220 pounds.
2789.54 So for me, I weigh
100 kilograms.
2791.97 That means that 1
to 3 milligrams--
2796.17 again, milligrams,
thousandth of a gram.
2798.48 1 to 3 milligrams of caffeine
per kilogram of body weight
2802.05 would mean for me.
2803.1 I could safely ingest 100 to
300 milligrams of caffeine
2808.02 in a single dose,
in a single drink,
2811.2 if that's the way
I'm consuming it,
2812.88 or pill form if that's the
way that I'm consuming it.
2815.46 And it's very likely that
that will be a tolerable dose.
2818.77 However, if you are
not somebody that's
2820.98 accustomed to drinking
caffeine on a regular basis,
2824.07 I suggest you start on the
lower end of that 1 to 3
2828.03 milligrams per kilogram
of body weight range.
2830.862 So for instance,
if you're somebody
2832.32 who weighs 50 kilograms, that's
approximately 110 pounds.
2836.55 And you would be
pretty comfortable
2839.07 ingesting somewhere between 50
and 150 milligrams of caffeine.
2843.39 So what I recommend is that
people who are considering
2845.64 using caffeine as a tool or who
are already ingesting caffeine,
2849.72 start to think about
the dosage of caffeine
2851.67 that you are ingesting
or plan to ingest
2853.74 and the timing in which
you ingest that caffeine
2856.47 relative to certain tasks
throughout your day,
2859.59 your waking, and your sleep.
2860.76 And we'll talk about
that in just a moment.
2862.552 But the first step for
you is to figure out
2864.87 how much you weigh
in kilograms and then
2867.6 to go to that number of 1
to 3 milligrams of caffeine
2871.56 per kilogram of body weight.
2873.1 And that's a good
range in which you
2875.67 might want to explore
the use of caffeine
2877.74 in a single application,
meaning a single dose.
2881.7 Now, I do realize that
some people out there are
2884.55 drinking coffee all day long
or having coffee in the morning
2887.43 and again in the afternoon.
2889.62 What I'm referring to here
is the ingestion of caffeine
2893.37 in a single bout, right?
2895.02 1 cup of coffee or 2 cups
of coffee, for instance,
2899.13 to achieve that 100
to 300 milligram
2900.91 range if that's what's
appropriate for your body
2902.91 weight.
2903.41 But to avoid any confusion,
when I talk about dosage
2906.33 of caffeine, what I'm
really talking about
2908.13 is not the total amount of
caffeine ingested per day.
2910.703 I'm talking about
the total amount
2912.12 of caffeine ingested in one
sitting or setting, that is.
2917.13 And if you're somebody who's
drinking caffeine multiple
2919.77 times throughout the day, you
can imagine-- for instance,
2922.21 let's say the
appropriate dose for you
2925.47 in order to get an enhancement
in mental performance
2928.2 or physical performance
is 200 milligrams.
2930.523 And you are somebody who's
doing some work in the morning,
2932.94 and you want to have
that lift in the morning
2934.44 to be able to focus better.
2935.617 And you're doing some physical
exercise in the afternoon
2937.95 or vice versa that you
would ingest 200 milligrams
2941.4 of caffeine at two
separate times per day
2943.98 separated by about four hours.
2945.96 Now you don't have
to separate them.
2947.86 You could put them two
hours apart, for instance.
2950.34 But we'll talk about half-life
of caffeine and so forth.
2953.28 Just keep in mind that, if
you're ingesting 200 milligrams
2956.34 of caffeine and that's the
appropriate dose for you
2959.01 based on your body
weight and then you
2960.72 are ingesting another 200
milligrams of caffeine an hour
2963.18 later, you are effectively
ingesting approximately 400
2967.23 milligrams of caffeine,
which is going
2968.88 to start exceeding the dose
in which you can normally
2972.06 tolerate without feeling
anxious and jittery.
2974.52 With all of that
said, there is a range
2976.98 of tolerance for caffeine
that's based on two things.
2979.33 One is a preexisting disposition
that is whether or not
2982.515 your genetics and nervous system
and the backdrop of your life,
2985.14 how much stress
you're experiencing
2986.598 tends to make you feel more
anxious and alert and jittery
2989.37 before you ingest any caffeine.
2991.23 And the other is how so-called
caffeine-adapted you are.
2994.71 We often hear about tolerance.
2996.12 Tolerance means
something very specific.
2997.9 It's the ability to ingest
more and more of something
3000.68 with a plateau that is a no
increase or an actual reduction
3006.35 in the effectiveness
of that thing.
3007.92 But here we're not really
talking about tolerance
3010.14 to caffeine.
3010.64 What we're talking about
is being caffeine-adapted.
3012.89 A simple way to
understand whether or not
3014.6 your caffeine-adapted or not
is that, if you drink caffeine
3017.99 and it tends to
increase your heart rate
3020.09 and make you feel more alert
and a bit more anxious,
3022.67 then chances are you are
not caffeine-adapted,
3025.04 provided the amount of caffeine
is within the healthy range
3027.8 for you, that is, the ranges
we talked about a moment ago.
3030.57 However, here's somebody
who drinks caffeine
3032.42 and you actually feel
alert and relaxed,
3034.88 chances are you are
caffeine-adapted.
3037.37 And so at various times
during today's episode,
3039.47 I'll talk about people
who are caffeine-adapted
3041.428 and people who are
not caffeine-adapted.
3043.1 We'll talk about the use of
caffeine every other day.
3045.75 I know a few habitual caffeine
drinkers including myself,
3048.63 just the simple mention of
that probably sounds aversive.
3052.49 But there is actually
great utility
3054.65 to using caffeine every other
day as opposed to every day.
3057.53 But just keep in
mind that some people
3059.57 will drink caffeine and not get
much of a lift from it at all.
3062.635 Other people will
drink caffeine,
3064.01 and they will feel extremely
anxious even at dosages
3066.74 far lower than that 1 to
3 milligrams per kilogram
3070.52 of body weight range that
I described a moment ago.
3074.46 So you have to take into
account individual differences.
3077.2 That said, 1 to 3 milligrams of
caffeine per kilogram of body
3080.35 weight for a given sitting.
3083.05 For your morning coffee or
your morning yerba maté tea is
3086.83 a good range from
which to start.
3088.45 And I do encourage you
to go online and look up
3091.598 the various beverages and
foods that you might be
3093.64 eating that contain caffeine.
3095.65 For instance, some people
are surprised to discover
3099.34 that the coffee that they get
from some of the more standard
3102.58 popular vendors out
there, the small coffee
3106.54 or the medium
coffee, for instance,
3108.41 can contain as much as 400 to
600 milligrams of caffeine.
3112.39 And the large
coffee that is often
3114.67 sold at those
commercial vendors can
3116.17 contain as much as 1 gram,
1,000 milligrams, of caffeine.
3120.69 Now you may be
adapted to that such
3122.53 that it doesn't make
you feel anxious,
3124.21 but if you wonder why
you feel irritable
3126.85 and you get a headache
when you don't
3129.07 get that caffeine or
that amount of caffeine
3132.1 at precisely the time that
you're used to getting it
3135.04 each day, that's because
you are consuming
3137.47 quite large quantities of
caffeine on a regular basis.
3141.77 So I do recommend whether or not
you drink soda or coffee or tea
3145.06 that you figure out
the source of that.
3147.7 OK, so figure out what
vendor you purchase it
3150.55 from, what kind of coffee,
and go online and spend
3152.882 a little bit of time
because the information is
3154.84 out there to discover
what levels of caffeine
3158.02 you're actually ingesting.
3159.46 Now if you happen to be
ingesting more than 1
3161.69 to 3 milligrams per kilogram
of body weight of caffeine,
3164.74 that's not necessarily bad.
3166.27 However, you do want to
be careful about ingesting
3169.45 very high levels of caffeine
over long periods of time
3173.41 in your life because there can
be issues that start to arise.
3176.5 In particular, a bias
towards higher levels
3179.2 of anxiety and depletion
of certain electrolytes.
3182.68 Because caffeine
is a diuretic can
3184.15 cause you to lose sodium and
other things of that sort.
3186.79 And also just from simply
a dependent standpoint,
3191.71 it does appear that if you
ingest high levels of caffeine
3194.92 that is exceeding the
dosages that normally you
3197.53 could get away with
and get just as
3199.27 much mental-enhancing and
physical-enhancing benefits
3203.02 that you can cause
some disruption
3205.6 to the microvasculature.
3207.01 You can bias yourself towards
headaches, anxiety attacks,
3209.8 and you can become
actually quite irritable
3211.797 when you're not getting those
higher levels of caffeine.
3214.13 So I do encourage
you to figure out
3215.68 not just what an appropriate
caffeine dosage would
3218.62 be for you but also
how much caffeine
3220.21 you might already be ingesting.
3222.01 The first tool I'd
like to talk about
3223.6 is one that I've
mentioned before
3225.49 on this podcast several times.
3227.65 And it's something that
if you haven't heard of
3230.77 will be very useful to you.
3231.97 And if you have heard
this tool before,
3234.25 I'm going to add some
additional features
3236.08 to the description
of this tool that
3237.91 should make this
worthwhile for you as well.
3239.81 And that is to delay
your caffeine intake
3243.37 to 90 to 120 minutes after
waking up on most days.
3248.56 And I'll be very
clear as to days
3251.02 in which you might want
to ingest caffeine more
3253.96 closely to when you wake up.
3255.52 Why would you want to delay
your caffeine intake to 90
3259.59 to 120 minutes after waking?
3261.91 The answer to that
is very simple.
3263.59 Many people wake
up in the morning.
3266.59 They drink caffeine within
10, 20, 30, sometimes
3270.16 within 2 minutes of waking.
3272.38 And they feel more
alert naturally.
3274.66 That makes sense because
of the effects of caffeine
3276.85 in blocking the
effects of adenosine
3278.65 that I talked about
earlier and its effects
3280.93 on other
neurotransmitter systems.
3282.67 But then what they find is
that, in the early afternoon,
3286.09 in particular, after lunch,
they experience a dramatic dip
3290.2 in their overall levels of
energy, the so-called afternoon
3292.66 crash.
3293.98 And in most cases, the
way they respond to that
3296.71 is to ingest more
caffeine, which
3298.63 indeed can increase their
levels of mood and alertness.
3302.74 However, as we'll
soon talk about,
3304.93 there is a problem
with ingesting caffeine
3306.97 in the afternoon if it
falls within 8 or 10
3311.83 or dare I even say 12
hours of going to sleep.
3314.29 And that is, the caffeine
ingested in the afternoon--
3318.18 for most everybody, let's say
for 95-plus percent of people--
3323.28 disrupts the
architecture and quality
3325.74 of their nighttime sleep.
3327.0 And I should say that
it doesn't necessarily
3328.95 impact their ability to fall
asleep and maybe even sleep
3331.56 through the night but that the
depth and quality of that sleep
3335.1 is disrupted by consuming
caffeine in the afternoon.
3338.035 A little bit later,
I'll talk about how
3339.66 you can offset some of
those negative effects
3341.73 if you absolutely require
caffeine in the afternoon.
3344.7 But there's a huge advantage
to restricting your caffeine
3347.46 intake to the early
part of your day
3349.2 but not consuming caffeine
within the first 90
3352.3 to 120 minutes after waking.
3355.23 In fact, many people find that
if they delay their caffeine
3358.47 intake to 90 to 120
minutes after waking up
3361.98 that they feel more
alert in the morning,
3364.74 and they completely avoid
that afternoon crash.
3367.74 Now that said, many
people, including myself,
3369.84 do need a short nap
or non-sleep deep rest
3374.01 or other form of relaxation
for 10 to 30 minutes
3376.56 in the afternoon.
3377.31 That is natural and healthy.
3379.24 I'm not referring
to the need for that
3382.17 when I refer to the
so-called afternoon crash.
3384.165 What I'm talking about
in the afternoon crash
3386.04 is a inability to recover
energy and focus and a need
3390.54 to consume more caffeine just to
make it through the afternoon.
3394.17 By delaying caffeine intake to
90 to 120 minutes after waking,
3398.645 there are a couple of things
that are accomplished.
3400.77 First of all, you offset
that afternoon crash.
3403.288 And this is an effect that
many people experience
3405.33 the very first time they
start delaying their caffeine
3407.58 intake to 90 to 120
minutes after waking.
3410.52 And the reason this works
so well is the following.
3413.83 As I mentioned
earlier, adenosine
3415.62 is a molecule that builds up
the longer that we are awake.
3418.26 It is a molecule that
is reduced or cleared
3421.53 from our system by sleep.
3423.96 So when we emerge
from sleep regardless
3426.36 of how long we've slept,
our adenosine levels
3429.51 are lower than they
were when we went
3431.4 to sleep the previous night.
3433.82 If you slept well
enough and long enough,
3437.71 those adenosine levels
can be very, very low,
3440.67 but they are never
completely zero.
3443.328 When you wake up in
the morning, even
3444.87 if you're one of these people
that springs out of bed
3447.078 and is ready to attack the
day-- and here I'm certainly
3449.4 not describing myself.
3451.2 I'm not one of those people.
3453.46 I tend to wake fairly slowly.
3454.96 But if you're one of those
spring up and attack the day
3457.86 or you're one of
the people who moves
3460.77 more slowly into your
day, regardless, there's
3464.34 still some residual
adenosine in your system.
3466.51 And this is
particularly the case
3468.03 if you did not get enough
sleep or enough depth of sleep
3471.252 the night before.
3471.96 The correct ratio is a slow-wave
sleep and rapid eye movement
3474.55 sleep.
3475.05 And for those of you
interested in optimizing sleep,
3477.217 I'll just refer you to our
master your sleep episode
3479.88 of the Huberman Lab podcast,
the perfect your sleep episode
3482.6 of the Huberman Lab podcast.
3483.86 And we have a tool kit for sleep
all of which are available,
3486.36 zero cost, time-stamped, et
cetera at hubermanlab.com.
3491.18 You wake up in the morning.
3492.38 And your adenosine levels are
low, but they're not zero.
3496.96 And if you didn't sleep that
well or deeply enough the night
3499.46 before, you're going to have
more adenosine in your system.
3504.3 You might think
the logical thing
3505.71 to do is therefore
to drink caffeine
3507.24 and to block the
adenosine that's there.
3509.41 But what happens
if you do that is
3511.02 there's an accumulation, a
sort of glut of adenosine
3513.9 that hangs around.
3515.64 And then in the afternoon, when
the effects of that caffeine
3518.31 start to wear off,
you will experience
3520.26 the so-called afternoon crash.
3522.69 As I mentioned
earlier, there is a way
3525.12 to clear out the adenosine
that's present when you wake up
3528.3 in the morning and to
clear it out essentially
3531.9 completely without just
blocking its receptors
3535.32 and letting it accumulate
or hang around.
3537.93 And the way to do that
is to deliberately spike
3541.14 your cortisol.
3542.078 Now, many of you have heard of
cortisol, the so-called stress
3544.62 hormone, as a bad thing.
3546.42 And indeed, chronically elevated
cortisol is a bad thing.
3549.55 It depletes your immune system.
3551.2 It's bad for
psychosocial effects.
3553.74 It tends to make us feel
anxious and on and on.
3556.5 But cortisol itself is not bad.
3558.45 Cortisol is wonderful.
3559.68 Cortisol enhances the
efficiency of the immune system.
3563.64 It makes us alert and focused.
3565.32 It stimulates our metabolism.
3566.64 It does a huge number of
positive things, provided
3570.18 that it is released in
a circadian fashion.
3573.66 That is, at the
appropriate times
3575.22 every 24 hours and that it tends
to peak very close to waking.
3578.748 In fact, one of the reasons
you wake up in the morning,
3581.04 assuming that you weren't
woken up by some noise
3583.65 or sleeping in an environment
that's too warm, et cetera,
3586.62 is that your cortisol
levels start to rise.
3589.14 And shortly after waking,
your cortisol levels
3591.54 will start to reach their peak.
3592.92 And when I refer to
a cortisol pulse,
3595.2 that's just biology
nerd speak for a rise
3599.49 and peak in cortisol.
3601.65 You want that cortisol pulse
to occur early in the day close
3605.31 to waking, and you want that
for a couple of reasons.
3607.75 First of all, if you don't
restrict that cortisol pulse
3610.77 to early in the
day, it will tend
3612.84 to bleed into the
later parts of the day.
3614.97 And actually, a late
shifted cortisol peak
3617.73 is one of the
hallmark signatures
3619.74 of depression,
low-level depression,
3621.24 and serious depression.
3622.2 And it can start
to disrupt sleep
3623.67 and certainly can
disrupt mood metabolism
3626.19 and your immune system.
3627.94 So you want that cortisol
peak early in the day.
3629.94 How do you ensure
that that happens?
3631.41 Well, you wake up
in the morning.
3632.7 And whether or not you're
a bounce-out-of-bed type
3634.783 or you're more groggy, you kind
of wade slowly into the day
3637.98 type like I am, you wake up,
and you don't ingest caffeine.
3643.98 Fine and, in fact,
beneficial to hydrate
3646.77 with water and electrolytes.
3649.8 Terrific.
3650.88 In fact, I would
say necessary to get
3654.01 bright light in your eyes
ideally from sunlight.
3656.01 I've talked about
this many, many times
3657.27 before on the podcast.
3658.2 If you wake up before
the sun comes out,
3659.917 then turn on bright
artificial lights.
3661.5 But then certainly once the sun
is out and even on cloudy days,
3664.51 in fact, especially on cloudy
days, get outside for anywhere
3667.74 from 5 to 20, maybe
even 30 minutes.
3669.75 Do some work outside, take
your breakfast outside
3672.15 if you're a breakfast eater.
3674.01 Get something done outside even
if it's just to get outside
3677.373 and get bright
light in your eyes.
3678.79 Why?
3679.29 Well, because it's
been shown in studies
3682.23 on humans that getting
bright light in your eyes
3685.14 in the first hour after
waking or as soon as possible
3688.65 after waking increases the
peak of that cortisol pulse
3692.43 by 50%, 5-0.
3694.95 And that cortisol pulse, yes,
increases mood, yes, increases
3698.25 alertness, but it does one
other very important thing,
3700.93 which is that, through
an indirect pathway,
3703.86 it can clear out any
residual adenosine that
3706.93 might be present in your
system when you wake up
3708.93 in the morning.
3709.705 Again, this is going to be
especially important for those
3712.08 of you that are not
getting as much sleep
3713.82 or as much quality
sleep as you would like.
3716.852 It's going to be very important
for you to get that morning
3719.31 bright light ideally
from sunlight,
3721.14 get that cortisol peak going.
3722.82 Other ways to increase
that cortisol peak
3724.59 would be to do some
physical activity.
3726.7 If you don't have time to do
a full workout, well then,
3729.72 getting some movement--
3731.535 10 minutes of
skipping rope or even
3733.05 5 minutes of skipping rope
or jumping jacks or walking
3736.32 if that's all you have time
for ideally while getting
3738.66 the sunlight in your eyes.
3739.87 But that's going to zero
out the adenosine present
3742.74 in your system.
3745.57 If, however, you were to
wake up and immediately
3748.08 drink caffeine--
3749.55 caffeine itself can
stimulate the release
3752.04 of cortisol a little bit
more than it would otherwise
3755.4 be present in your system.
3756.96 But by blocking those
adenosine receptors
3760.92 and because of the
indirect effects
3763.08 of caffeine on the
cortisol system,
3765.24 you actually are reducing
the clearance of adenosine
3768.48 that would otherwise occur.
3770.32 So I realize that's a mouthful.
3771.75 Just to be very
clear, if you wake up
3773.49 and you ingest
caffeine right away,
3775.375 you're blocking the
adenosine receptor,
3777.0 but you're not clearing it out.
3778.292 You're also preventing cortisol
from having its normal increase
3782.64 and rise such that it can
directly clear out adenosine
3786.63 because cortisol can
clear out adenosine.
3790.2 And that's what you want.
3791.53 You want to be at
maximum alertness
3793.32 and focus in your morning
and throughout your day.
3795.87 And by delaying your caffeine to
90 to 120 minutes after waking,
3800.67 you set up your system so that
you get that morning cortisol
3803.74 peak.
3804.24 Ideally, a peak that's
even greater because you're
3806.34 getting your bright
light viewing.
3809.1 And then when you ingest your
caffeine 90 to 120 minutes
3812.61 after waking, not only will
you be craving it just a little
3815.73 bit, but you will be
drinking that caffeine
3818.25 on an already existing backdrop
of increased alertness for two
3823.29 reasons.
3823.81 One is adenosine is zeroed
out, and your cortisol peak
3829.32 is higher.
3830.01 And so now when you
ingest caffeine,
3831.69 you can actually ingest
levels of caffeine
3833.67 that are a little
more reasonable that
3835.92 almost with certainty are
going to fall in this 1 to 3
3838.26 milligrams per kilogram dosage
and will allow you to feel
3842.22 really alert and will
carry that alertness well
3846.03 into the afternoon hours without
the need to drink more caffeine
3849.66 and thereby will prevent
you from drinking
3852.69 caffeine and disrupting
your nighttime sleep.
3854.91 And, of course, by getting
better nighttime sleep,
3857.28 you're going to zero out
your adenosine even more.
3859.53 So what I'm describing here
are essentially two tools.
3862.108 I'm telling you to get
morning sunlight and maybe
3864.15 some exercise in
conjunction with that
3865.733 even if it's brief exercise.
3867.57 But the main tool
of delaying caffeine
3870.27 90 to 120 minutes after
waking has immediate effects,
3875.37 but it also sets in
motion a cascade or domino
3878.91 falls that lead to better
sleep and more wakefulness
3882.93 the next night and the next
day and so on and so forth.
3886.78 Now I realize there are some
people who just simply cannot
3889.77 or will not delay their caffeine
90 to 120 minutes after waking
3893.22 for whatever reason.
3894.6 First off, let me say
that, if you are somebody
3896.94 who likes to wake up and
do very intense exercise
3899.82 within the first 90
minutes after waking, well,
3902.362 in that case, it would
be appropriate to ingest
3904.32 your caffeine just prior
to doing that exercise.
3906.63 Not a problem.
3907.89 Not a problem.
3908.55 But you should expect that
the combination of drinking
3912.15 caffeine very shortly after
waking plus exercising very
3915.54 intensely shortly after
waking will increase
3918.57 the intensity of that early
afternoon and afternoon fatigue
3922.59 that you feel.
3923.28 Now for some people,
that's a great thing.
3925.03 They can afford to take a nap
or do non-sleep deep rest, step
3928.23 away from work, and so forth.
3930.81 In that case, I
strongly encourage
3932.34 you to do whatever
it is that allows
3933.87 you to get regular exercise
because regular exercise is
3937.143 going to be very beneficial.
3938.31 In fact, we did
an entire episode
3940.17 called tool kit for fitness that
describes a couple of different
3943.14 but really one
main structure that
3944.97 allows you to get the
appropriate amount
3946.92 of resistance training and
cardiovascular training
3949.605 and flexibility training
throughout the week.
3951.48 I happen to follow that
program, and it works very well.
3955.17 And it does involve
some of those workouts
3958.26 to come very early in the
morning shortly after waking.
3961.41 And in those cases,
I do ingest caffeine
3963.36 just prior to those, so within
10, 20 minutes of waking.
3966.45 However, on other
days, I personally
3969.03 delay my caffeine intake
90 to 120 minutes,
3971.25 and I've done that
to great benefit.
3973.2 And most people, if not,
all people that try that,
3976.17 have reported the same.
3977.73 I should mention that some
people will find getting out
3980.37 to that 90 minutes
to be excruciatingly
3982.08 difficult because they're
so accustomed to ingesting
3985.11 caffeine close to waking up.
3987.03 In that case, maybe just
push out your caffeine intake
3989.31 by about 15 minutes
each day until you
3991.98 hit that 90 to 120-minute mark.
3994.013 And that will make
it much easier.
3995.43 It might take you a
week or so to get there.
3996.94 But once you get
there, you'll find it
3998.523 to be quite easy to maintain.
4000.107 The other thing is that,
if you are somebody
4001.94 who insists on drinking caffeine
very shortly after waking,
4005.06 I would encourage you to drink
half of your caffeine then
4008.33 and then the other half of your
caffeine about an hour later.
4012.08 That also will help offset
some of the afternoon crash
4015.11 for reasons related to the
so-called kinetics of caffeine.
4018.44 Caffeine has a quarter
life of about 12 hours.
4021.18 That means that if you were
to ingest a cup of coffee
4023.87 at let's say 8:00 AM--
4026.33 and let's say 100
milligram coffee
4028.01 just for sake of simplicity,
that about 25% of that caffeine
4032.99 action--
4033.8 we wouldn't really say 25
milligrams, but about 25%
4036.86 of that caffeine
action will still
4038.75 be present at 8:00
PM that night,
4043.35 which is pretty remarkable.
4044.81 So there's a long arc
of caffeine effects,
4046.6 and this is why it
can impede sleep if we
4049.12 take caffeine in the afternoon.
4050.66 But again, if you're
somebody who wakes up
4052.595 and you really need
caffeine right away
4054.22 and you refuse to do this
90 to 120-minute delay thing
4057.13 that I'm talking about,
well then, in that case,
4059.372 I would drink half of
your caffeine upon waking
4061.33 and then a little bit more or
the other half about an hour
4065.89 later.
4066.41 And that will extend the
arc of that caffeine effects
4069.04 such that you don't need
it again in the afternoon
4071.2 because you won't experience
the afternoon crash.
4073.33 Because of the way
caffeine works,
4074.89 I should mention that,
if you ingest caffeine
4077.2 on an empty stomach, it will
have a more potent stimulant
4080.23 effect.
4081.94 That will also tend to increase
the level of jitteriness
4085.0 that caffeine can produce.
4086.38 Later, I'll talk about ways
to offset that jitteriness,
4088.69 but I'll just tell
you one tool now.
4090.34 Many people opt to take
100 milligrams of theanine,
4094.12 T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine, as
a way to offset some of that
4098.74 jitteriness.
4100.6 Theanine will reduce
the jitteriness
4102.22 of caffeine, which is
why many energy drink
4104.29 manufacturers and even
some coffee manufacturers
4107.05 are now putting theanine
in energy drinks
4109.359 and in ground coffee
because, no surprise,
4113.05 it allows people to consume
more of that beverage
4115.93 and thereby purchase more
of that beverage, which
4118.24 is what these vendors want
without feeling overly
4121.06 anxious and jittery.
4122.29 So you can take
pill form theanine
4123.758 if you want with your caffeine.
4125.05 I don't tend to do that.
4126.05 Rather, I control the total
dosage of my caffeine.
4128.68 I do tend to consume
caffeine on an empty stomach
4130.853 because I do restrict
my caffeine intake
4132.52 to the early part of the day.
4134.38 And I generally eat my first
meal somewhere around 11:00 AM,
4138.34 and then I generally my last
meal some time around 8:00
4141.38 PM or so.
4143.2 Those are averages.
4144.37 I would say plus
or minus an hour.
4146.06 And that's not because
I'm religiously
4147.819 following any kind of
time-restricted feeding.
4151.18 It's just that
tends to work best
4153.55 with my schedule
and my appetite.
4155.83 But again, that's
a general theme.
4157.99 There are days in which I
wake up and I'm very hungry,
4160.24 and I might ingest something,
small snack or something.
4163.872 Or if I'm meeting
somebody for breakfast,
4165.58 sometimes I'll have breakfast.
4166.83 Sometimes I won't.
4167.96 And so on and so forth.
4169.22 The point is that
you can get away
4171.069 with drinking less caffeine to
get the stimulant effect if you
4174.1 do it on an empty stomach.
4175.42 And if you're somebody
who likes to exercise
4177.399 on an empty stomach--
4179.2 and I'm one of those people--
4180.52 well then, ingesting caffeine
just prior to exercise
4183.729 can be a fantastic tool.
4184.901 A little bit later,
we'll talk about some
4186.609 of the physical
performance-enhancing effects
4190.12 of caffeine.
4190.779 But I'll just briefly
jump to a point about that
4194.26 as we relate to
morning exercise.
4196.3 If you are somebody who
regularly ingests caffeine--
4199.12 and we can define
regularly by, if you've
4202.24 ingested caffeine every
day for the last two weeks,
4206.02 you're a regular
consumer of caffeine.
4207.993 Whereas if you're somebody
who only ingests caffeine
4210.16 somewhere between two and four
times per week, well then,
4212.95 you are not a regular
consumer of caffeine.
4215.29 You're an intermittent
user of caffeine.
4217.42 Well, if you're somebody who's
a regular user of caffeine,
4219.88 the performance-enhancing
effects of caffeine are going
4222.85 to be most dramatic if you
take two or three days off from
4226.84 drinking caffeine,
which to my mind as a--
4229.555 I don't want to call
myself a caffeine addict
4231.43 but a regular caffeine user.
4232.9 That's a horrible notion to
me, it is an aversive notion,
4236.26 because I do like the
effects of caffeine so much.
4238.54 But if you really want
to see the maximum
4240.52 performance-enhancing
effects of caffeine,
4242.53 you will do either
one of two things.
4244.49 You will either
abstain from caffeine
4246.13 for a few days or three days
prior to ingesting caffeine,
4250.84 or you will use caffeine
on an empty stomach.
4254.2 It's very clear that
caffeine on an empty stomach
4256.66 enhances both the mental
and physical enhancing
4259.6 effects of caffeine.
4260.527 And, of course, all of
that has to be stated
4262.36 on the backdrop of consideration
that you're very, very hungry,
4266.218 it can be make it
hard to concentrate
4267.76 and so on and so forth.
4268.718 So I'm not encouraging people to
starve themselves by any means.
4272.17 Certainly, don't do that.
4273.32 But if you want to maximize the
performance-enhancing effects
4275.92 of caffeine, you will consume
it on an empty stomach.
4278.17 And then as a final point to
that, caffeine is a diuretic.
4282.2 It causes us to lose fluid
and, along with that fluid,
4285.46 to excrete sodium because
of the effects of caffeine
4288.07 on various processes
within the kidney.
4290.72 So one thing that works
very well to maintain mood
4294.61 and alertness longer given
a certain amount of caffeine
4299.23 intake and to avoid
the jitteriness
4301.15 and what can sometimes feel
like a crash or low blood sugar
4303.97 feeling or even blurry
vision is to make sure
4306.49 that you consume at least
an equal volume of water
4310.6 with your caffeine.
4311.668 And ideally, that
water would contain
4313.21 maybe a small pinch
of salt or some sort
4314.92 of electrolyte drink--
4316.51 or powder, rather.
4317.59 For me, I use element.
4318.82 Full disclosure, they are a
podcast affiliate and sponsor.
4321.91 But you don't need to do that.
4323.32 You could simply just have
a glass of water alongside
4326.44 your coffee or espresso or your
yerba maté and just put a small
4329.56 pinch of sea salt in that or
evem just playing table salt.
4333.25 And that will help offset some
of the jitteriness of caffeine.
4336.01 A lot of people think that,
when they ingest caffeine,
4338.59 they get the jitteriness and
crash because their blood
4340.96 sugar is low.
4341.83 And while that can be the
case, oftentimes, it's
4343.87 simply because of the
excretion of sodium
4345.842 that's occurred when
they've ingested caffeine.
4347.8 So I encourage you
to hydrate well
4350.41 and to hydrate with
something that contains
4352.69 a little bit of sodium.
4353.83 Obviously, not so much
that increases hypertension
4355.96 or something of that sort
but a small amount of sodium
4357.88 or an electrolyte
drink like Element.
4359.44 And there are other
electrolyte drinks
4361.287 out there that can accomplish
the same, of course.
4363.37 Just a couple of
quick notes about
4364.787 theanine because there are
a growing number of products
4368.187 out there that contain theanine.
4369.52 And there's certainly a growing
number of people out there
4371.68 who are using theanine for the
effect that I described before,
4374.48 which is to offset some of
the jitteriness associated
4376.84 with caffeine-containing
beverages or foods.
4379.39 And, of course, I
should mention that I've
4382.18 talked about the
effects of theanine
4384.28 on sleep at that sleep
tool kit that you
4387.37 can find as a free download.
4388.73 You don't even have
to sign up for.
4389.83 Anything you just download
it from hubermanlab.com.
4391.96 Go to the menu, go
to a newsletter.
4393.22 You'll see the
tool kit for sleep.
4394.66 You'll see that the
so-called sleep stack
4397.33 that I use and recommend
includes magnesium 3 and 8,
4401.8 something called
apigenin and theanine,
4404.68 although that sleep
stack is designed
4407.23 to be taken 30 to 60
minutes prior to sleep.
4409.87 And I make the point
there, and I'll
4411.43 make it again here that
ingesting theanine prior
4414.52 to sleep is not a good
idea if you are somebody
4417.43 who tends to have very vivid
dreams, night terrors, or night
4420.76 walk--
4421.45 sleepwalking, excuse
me, et cetera.
4424.46 In that case, eliminate theanine
from the sleep stack.. .
4427.442 However, a number of
people are using theanine,
4429.4 and products are using
theanine to offset jitteriness
4432.22 from caffeine-containing
products
4433.75 during the daytime, daytime
consumption, that is.
4437.2 A couple of notes about
theanine-- theanine
4439.12 is something that is
present in green tea, right?
4441.73 It's now been created
as a supplement.
4443.8 It's what's called a
nonprotein amino acid.
4445.927 So while there are amino
acids and proteins,
4447.76 there are, of course, amino
acids and nonproteins.
4450.22 And theanine is one such
nonprotein amino acid.
4453.61 Theanine tends to stimulate
the so-called glutamate and
4457.72 glutamine pathway.
4459.34 It's actually very similar
to glutamate and glutamine,
4462.265 and it has a lot of effects
on a lot of different aspects
4465.82 of the nervous system.
4466.94 But the general
effect of theanine
4468.82 is to compete for the receptors
for certain neurotransmitters.
4472.93 And the neurotransmitters
I'm referring to
4475.45 are all excitatory
neurotransmitters,
4477.25 things like glutamate.
4478.3 And they govern a tremendous
amount of our daily thinking
4481.48 and action and
feeling, et cetera,
4483.07 because they're present
at so many connections
4484.987 between neurons in the brain.
4487.18 Theanine competes for the
receptors for glutamate
4490.93 and tends to reduce our
overall levels of alertness.
4494.9 So really, when people
take theanine along
4497.38 with caffeine,
what they're doing
4498.91 is they're really
taking a slight--
4501.572 I don't want to call it
depressant to the point
4503.53 where it misleads people and
makes people think that it
4505.87 will make you depressed.
4506.95 The word is a little
bit misleading.
4508.45 But it tends to
reduce or blunt some
4510.94 of the more excitatory
pro-alertness actions
4514.27 of neurons in the brain.
4515.535 So when you take it
alongside caffeine,
4517.16 tends to, quote unquote,
"even things out a bit."
4519.7 I should mention that
the dosages of theanine
4521.95 that are effective
for offsetting
4523.99 the jitteriness of caffeine
is 200 to 400 milligrams,
4527.68 and the studies that
I was able to find
4530.14 showed that essentially up
to 900 milligrams per day
4533.23 can be safe.
4534.13 But that's a very high
dosage of theanine.
4536.41 In fact, so much so
that it might increase
4539.14 sleepiness to the point
where it wouldn't feel good.
4541.97 There are also some
positive effects
4544.06 of daytime consumption
of theanine
4546.22 that are independent of reducing
the jitteriness of caffeine.
4549.688 For instance, there's
a study demonstrating
4551.48 that 17 days of ingesting
theanine at these 200 to 400
4555.8 milligram dosage at one
to three times per day
4560.27 can reduce depression
and anxiety.
4562.212 There are also some good
data out there showing
4564.17 that theanine can have positive
effects on endothelial cells--
4567.53 so blood vessels,
capillaries, and so on--
4569.63 and increase some of the
function of blood vessels,
4572.33 allowing them to pass
more blood through them
4575.63 and give them a little bit
more elasticity, if you will.
4578.31 So theanine has certain
pro-sleep effects
4581.06 if it's taken prior to sleep.
4582.44 It can enhance the quality,
depth, and duration of sleep.
4585.89 Again, if you're a
sleepwalker or somebody who
4587.87 has extremely vivid dreams
from which you wake up
4590.21 in the middle of the
night, probably best
4591.95 to leave out theanine or
maybe reduce the dosage down
4594.38 to 100 milligrams.
4595.31 And if that's still too much,
then eliminate it completely.
4597.83 But theanine can be terrific
for enhancing quality, depth,
4601.34 and duration of sleep.
4602.63 It can also reduce
the jitteriness
4606.17 associated with
caffeine-containing beverages
4608.81 and foods.
4609.83 And it has certain
antidepressant
4612.59 and pro-endothelial effects.
4615.23 That is, it can
offset depression.
4618.36 It can offset anxiety, although
those are minor effects,
4621.8 subtle effects.
4623.04 And it has been shown to
improve endothelial cell.
4626.21 That is, vessel and capillary
function and structure
4630.44 in ways that can be beneficial
for both brain and body.
4633.62 Now one final point
about theanine
4635.24 that's worth paying
attention to is
4636.86 that the kinetics
of theanine are
4638.24 such that you don't need to take
theanine every time you ingest
4642.5 a caffeinated beverage.
4645.07 When we ingest caffeine,
the peak effects of caffeine
4648.85 occur about 30 minutes
after we drink it.
4652.72 And there, I'm assuming
one takes it all at once.
4655.64 And this is a key point that
we'll come back to later rather
4658.24 than sipping your coffee
slowly over a couple of hours
4661.21 or an hour.
4662.11 If you drink all 200 or
300 milligrams of caffeine
4665.38 in your coffee or 600
milligrams of your coffee
4668.47 if you're getting one of
those commercial coffees
4671.59 and you take theanine
along with it,
4673.3 theanine will block
some of the jitteriness
4676.75 and anxiety-inducing
effects of caffeine
4679.7 that can occur for much
longer than the effects that
4683.17 caffeine lasts.
4683.98 So the peak in theanine occurs
about an hour after ingestion.
4688.28 I suppose if you want
to get really fancy
4690.61 and really dial in
the kinetics, you
4692.53 could ingest theanine
about half hour
4694.15 before you ingest your caffeine.
4695.483 But I think that's getting a
little bit excessive in terms
4698.92 of controlling your
microenvironment, if you will.
4701.65 I think it would be perfectly
fine to take a 100 to 200
4706.06 milligram capsule of theanine
along with your coffee or tea
4710.77 or so forth and just realize
that if you drink more caffeine
4714.25 or you extend your caffeine
intake over several hours
4717.07 that you don't necessarily
have to take theanine repeated
4719.68 times throughout the day.
4720.91 I'd like to take a
brief break and thank
4723.37 our sponsor, InsideTracker.
4725.62 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
4728.26 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
4730.72 to help you better
understand your body
4732.43 and help you reach
your health goals.
4734.23 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
4736.84 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
4739.792 your immediate and
long-term health
4741.25 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
4743.795 The problem with a
lot of blood and DNA
4745.42 tests out there, however,
is that you get data
4747.64 back about metabolic factors,
lipids, and hormones,
4750.18 and so forth, but you don't
know what to do with those data.
4752.68 InsideTracker
solves that problem
4754.63 and makes it very easy
for you to understand
4756.82 what sorts of nutritional,
behavioral, maybe even
4760.42 supplementation-based
interventions
4762.7 you might want to
take on in order
4764.38 to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic factors, hormones,
4767.08 lipids, and other
things that impact
4768.76 your immediate and
long-term health to bring
4770.83 those numbers into the
ranges that are appropriate
4773.32 and indeed optimal for you.

4785.59 Let's talk for a moment
about when to avoid caffeine.
4788.47 And in the same stroke,
let's also talk about some
4792.01 of the myths around caffeine.
4793.63 For instance, one of the
major myths around caffeine
4795.97 is that it can
increase osteoporosis.
4799.24 It turns out that, while there
is a relationship, of course,
4802.33 between calcium
and osteoporosis--
4804.73 that is reductions
in bone density.
4807.82 And it is the case that
caffeine can extract calcium
4811.6 from certain tissues.
4812.92 The large scale studies that
are out there essentially
4816.4 prove that, if people are
ingesting enough calcium
4819.37 through their diet, which
most everybody is-- although
4822.688 certainly, there
are some people that
4824.23 need to supplement calcium
or make it a point to consume
4827.11 more calcium-containing foods.
4828.79 But assuming that
you are getting
4830.32 adequate levels
of calcium, there
4832.87 is no direct relationship
between caffeine intake
4836.5 and osteoporosis, at least
not that I'm aware of.
4839.44 I know this was debated
for a number of years
4841.39 in the literature,
but the literature
4843.58 seems to have arrived
at a general consensus
4846.13 now that caffeine itself is not
going to create or exacerbate
4850.69 osteoporosis, provided people
are getting enough calcium
4853.63 through their diet.
4855.4 That is, through foods, through
supplementation, or both.
4859.72 Some of the other
myths around caffeine
4861.43 are that, for instance, caffeine
will reduce testosterone levels
4865.9 or will reduce estrogen levels.
4868.63 Other myths out there
are in exact opposite
4872.92 to that, that caffeine will
increase testosterone levels,
4876.01 in particular, free
testosterone levels.
4878.32 There have been some large scale
studies addressing the hormone
4881.29 effects of caffeine.
4882.49 They are a little
bit difficult to do.
4884.69 I should just
mention that caveat.
4886.28 And the reason they
are difficult to do
4888.04 is because 90% of adults
are consuming caffeine.
4891.61 And therefore, you
can imagine it's
4893.53 very hard to find a control
group to compare the caffeine
4897.46 consumers to.
4899.41 In particular, a
control group that's
4901.21 well controlled for other things
like lifestyle, diet, exercise,
4904.57 et cetera.
4905.98 However, when one controls
as well as one can
4910.42 for all the various factors that
could impact hormones, what one
4914.56 discovers is that caffeine
intake, at least at the dosages
4917.86 we talked about earlier, 1
two 3 milligrams per kilogram
4920.32 of body weight or even
up to double that,
4924.024 that there are no consistent
increases or reductions
4929.75 in testosterone or
estrogen in men or women
4933.17 that can be directly attributed
to the caffeine intake.
4936.35 And I say directly attributed
because in these association
4938.84 studies, one always
has to wonder,
4940.43 for instance, if because people
are ingesting more caffeine,
4944.3 they have more energy and
therefore exercising more.
4946.61 And exercise is
known to have effects
4948.35 on testosterone, estrogen,
and other hormones,
4950.73 whether or not the effects
of caffeine on those hormones
4953.3 is indirect and so
on and so forth.
4954.805 And this all just
underscores the challenges
4956.87 of doing studies on
humans in the wild
4959.09 in their natural habitat
of living as opposed
4961.218 to an acute study as it's
called to bring someone
4963.26 into the laboratory
and studying them just
4965.15 for those hours or moments.
4967.25 With all that said, there does
appear to be a relationship
4970.46 between caffeine intake and
so-called sex hormone binding
4974.09 globulin, which is a protein
present in the body of both men
4981.2 and women that binds to
the sex steroid hormones--
4984.77 testosterone and estrogen--
and prevents them
4986.75 from being in their
free or active form.
4989.93 It has been shown that
ingestion of caffeine--
4993.75 even in the sorts of dosage
ranges that are considered safe
4996.26 and that we've been discussing--
can increase sex hormone
4999.29 binding globulin such
that it can slightly
5002.32 reduce overall levels
of free testosterone
5005.02 and free estradiol in women.
5008.26 Now those effects are relatively
minor, but they do exist.
5011.942 If any of you are interested
in reading further
5013.9 into the effects of
caffeine on hormones,
5016.39 I'll just refer you to
a couple of studies.
5018.433 We will link to this in
the show note caption.
5020.35 The title of the
study is "Consumption
5022.45 of caffeinated beverages and
serum concentrations of sex
5025.24 steroid hormones in US men."
5027.13 And within this study,
there is a reference
5029.44 to a equally sized
empowered study done
5033.58 on women, both of
which converged
5035.44 on the same conclusion, by
examining more than a thousand.
5039.34 So in this case, 1,410 men or
more than a thousand women,
5043.24 that there are increases in
sex hormone binding globulin
5046.39 associated with increased
intake of coffee, in particular.
5051.37 But they were able to narrow
that down specifically
5054.31 to ingestion of caffeine.
5055.88 So it's not coffee per se that's
causing the increase in sex
5058.75 hormone binding globulin.
5060.1 It's actually caffeine itself.
5062.3 So again, the increases in
sex hormone binding globulin
5065.32 were not so significant
that, at least to my mind,
5067.75 they seem like a
concern, although I
5069.61 think that it is worth noting
that if you're going to consume
5072.79 caffeine that you probably
want to consume caffeine
5075.49 in a way that is in dosages and
with the sort of timing that
5080.65 will allow you to get away
with ingesting caffeine
5082.93 but not to excess, so to
derive the benefits of caffeine
5086.83 without for instance driving
up sex hormone binding globulin
5089.68 too far.
5090.49 Now why would that
be a good idea?
5091.94 Why would you want to make
sure that you have enough free
5094.315 testosterone and free estrogen?
5095.74 Well, some of that is
related to the acute effects
5098.65 of those hormones in terms
of well-being and libido
5101.77 and strength and mood, et
cetera, but some of those
5105.25 also relates to the longer
term effects of sex steroid
5108.49 hormones.
5109.57 Many people don't
realize this, but the sex
5111.91 steroid hormones
operate on the receptors
5114.46 at the surface of cells
to have immediate effects.
5117.17 But they also can enter
cells and actually
5119.53 go into the nucleus of cells
where the DNA of those cells
5122.32 are contained and control gene
expression in those cells.
5125.48 So the sex steroid hormones,
testosterone and estrogen,
5127.93 are controlling a lot of
different cellular functions
5130.54 over long periods of time.
5131.93 So blunting their action
over long periods of time
5135.13 is probably not a great idea.
5137.008 But again, at the
dosages of caffeine
5138.55 that we're talking about
today, 1 to 3 milligrams
5141.52 per kilogram of body
weight, unlikely
5143.86 that the increases in sex
hormone binding globulin
5146.26 that one experiences from that
are going to be detrimental.
5148.792 And certainly, the
positive effects
5150.25 of caffeine that one experiences
in terms of mental performance
5153.4 and physical
performance and the fact
5154.99 that it increases energy
to do the sorts of things
5157.21 like exercise that we
know can profoundly
5160.33 improve hormone
profiles, twofold
5163.87 or threefold improvement
in hormone profiles.
5167.24 In that case, it seems that
ingesting caffeine is overall
5170.92 a good thing, provided
it's not in excess.
5173.29 That also makes this
the appropriate time
5175.15 to mention one of the more
impressive effects of caffeine,
5178.37 which is on overall levels
of mood and mental health.
5181.54 There are several
studies on this,
5183.67 but the one that I'm
particularly fond of
5186.25 was published in 2019
in Psychiatry Research.
5189.79 And the title of the paper
is "Inverse association
5192.31 between caffeine intake
and depressive symptoms
5194.5 in US adults."
5195.61 And these are data from the
National Health and Nutrition
5198.13 Examination Survey.
5199.42 And the basic takeaway is
that, while, of course,
5202.34 there are a ton of
different factors
5204.25 that are going to
relate to whether or not
5206.2 people are depressed or
not, life circumstances,
5208.57 genetics, and so on, that--
5210.85 and here I'm quoting
from the study.
5212.35 "Caffeine's psychostimulant
properties--
5214.12 that just means
the ability to make
5215.578 us feel more alert
and positive--
5217.57 appeared to protect against
depressive symptoms."
5219.78 And, of course, they acknowledge
that additional studies are
5222.28 needed, but this is just one
of several studies pointing
5224.992 to the fact that people who
regularly ingest caffeine
5227.2 in the appropriate
dosages do seem
5229.9 to enjoy an antidepressive
effect overall.
5232.9 I wouldn't want anyone
to consider caffeine
5235.36 a treatment for
severe depression
5238.3 or at least not
alone a treatment
5239.74 for severe depression.
5240.91 But provided the
anxiety-inducing effects
5243.31 of caffeine can be kept in
check through use of theanine
5246.01 or making sure that the dosage
and the timing of caffeine
5248.86 ingestion is correct,
then caffeine overall
5251.08 seems to be good for our
mood and prevent depression
5254.92 or at least keep
depression at bay
5257.05 when depression might otherwise
surface or be more severe.
5261.1 And, of course, there are the
don'ts surrounding caffeine
5263.74 intake as it relates to sleep.
5267.27 And to put it very
simply, sleep--
5269.7 that is getting
enough quality sleep
5271.62 each night-- is the foundation.
5273.713 It is the bedrock of mental
health, physical health,
5275.88 and performance.
5276.63 Sleep and the power of sleep
far exceeds any nootropic
5280.95 you could ever take,
any prescription drug
5283.38 you could ever take, any
health-promoting tool
5286.89 for your immune system,
your metabolism,
5289.27 your mental function,
your physical function you
5291.27 could ever take.
5291.96 Sleep is the bedrock.
5293.67 I know a lot of people
experience challenge
5296.07 with sleep.
5297.24 Nobody is perfect about sleep.
5298.89 That's important
to keep in mind.
5300.55 I think a good goal is
to get enough quality
5303.75 sleep of sufficient duration
80% of the nights of your life
5306.96 and then as much as possible
to make sure that the remaining
5309.69 20% of nights you are
not getting enough
5311.777 sleep for good reasons as
opposed to hard reasons.
5313.86 Good reasons would
include raising children.
5316.08 That's important.
5316.92 After all, every species
desires to make more of itself
5321.03 and to preserve and extend
the well-being of its young,
5324.99 so child-rearing is a
perfectly legitimate reason
5327.99 to get a lack of sleep.
5329.74 But you really want to strive
to get quality sleep most nights
5333.66 of your life, which means that,
even if you're somebody who
5337.86 can, quote unquote,
"drink an espresso"
5339.63 and then fall right asleep,
that you avoid caffeine intake
5343.86 in the 12 hours prior to sleep.
5346.89 I realize not everyone
will be able to do that.
5349.12 And in fact, I
sometimes violate that,
5350.95 so I tend to go to sleep
around 10:00 PM every night,
5355.6 sometimes 11:00,
occasionally 12:00 midnight,
5358.32 but usually around
10:00 PM every night.
5362.61 I confess that my last
ingestion of caffeine
5365.97 is not always 10:00
AM or prior to that,
5369.55 so sometimes I will
have caffeine up
5371.28 until 11:00 AM or maybe noon.
5374.16 And very, very rarely, I'll have
an afternoon coffee or espresso
5379.62 or noncalorie-containing
soda or tea or something
5384.0 that's of that sort.
5385.48 But I really tried to
restrict my caffeine intake
5387.96 to the early part of my day
that is before noon, given
5391.56 that I go to sleep around
10:00 PM each night.
5394.47 And I strongly encourage
everyone out there
5397.29 to try and limit their
afternoon caffeine intake.
5400.83 This is something that Dr.
Matt Walker, who's an expert
5404.1 sleep researcher out of
University of California
5407.07 Berkeley Psychology and
neuroscience department there,
5409.56 author of the incredible
book Why We sleep.
5411.42 He's been on this podcast,
many other podcasts,
5414.63 talking about the
importance of sleep.
5416.61 He will remind us, and
I'll remind you now
5419.13 that the quarter life
of caffeine is 12 hours.
5422.772 I mentioned this earlier, but
I'm going to repeat it again.
5425.23 And that means that, if you
ingest caffeine at noon,
5429.3 25% of its effects
more or less, OK?
5432.385 I'm using a broad stroke here
to talk about quarter life.
5434.76 25% of that is still going
to be bioactive at midnight
5439.2 that night, which will disrupt
the early phase of your night,
5442.62 the amount of slow-wave
sleep, which then in turn
5445.32 will disrupt the amount of rapid
eye movement sleep, which will
5448.35 disrupt your
emotional processing
5450.72 during the following day
and so on and so forth.
5453.28 None of this is
to say that if you
5454.74 have the occasional cup of
coffee in the afternoon,
5456.635 that it's going to
completely demolish
5458.37 your sleep/wake cycle forever.
5459.9 But I really encourage people
to avoid drinking caffeine
5463.26 in the 12 hours prior to sleep.
5465.468 And if you can't do that, within
the 10 hours prior to sleep.
5468.01 And if you can't do that, within
the 8 hours prior to sleep.
5470.46 So really try and
limit your caffeine
5472.002 intake in the 8
to 12 hours prior
5475.11 to going to sleep at night.
5476.26 And, of course, slow-wave
sleep, aka deep sleep,
5478.62 is the sleep that's associated
with somewhat mundane dreams,
5482.725 which makes it sound like it
might not be that important.
5485.1 But it's also the sleep that's
associated with growth hormone
5489.24 release, which is important
for protein synthesis,
5492.48 repair of all bodily
tissues and metabolism.
5495.36 And slow-wave sleep
is also critically
5498.33 attached to your
immune system's ability
5500.82 to clear out bacteria and
viruses that might otherwise
5503.58 infect your tissues.
5504.63 Now I'd like to talk about
caffeine and performance.
5507.48 And that includes both
mental performance
5509.25 and physical performance.
5511.84 Now I'd like to
talk about caffeine
5513.57 and its positive
effects on performance
5515.85 when used correctly.
5517.5 And here we are referring
to both mental performance
5520.47 and physical performance.
5522.69 The exploration of caffeine
as a pro-performance tool
5526.59 has been explored since
the 1930s, at least
5529.95 that's some of the earliest
documented literature on this.
5533.19 Although I have
to imagine, given
5534.72 that people have been
using caffeine for much
5536.64 longer than that, that long
ago somebody realized that,
5540.42 by ingesting a certain
plant, that they
5542.91 felt much more
alertness and were
5544.29 able to hunt and gather or do
any number of different things
5547.05 better and, as a
consequence, decide
5549.18 to consume more of that plant.
5552.18 Now these days, we
consume a lot of caffeine
5554.37 in the form of coffee
and tea mainly,
5556.08 and some people consume it in
the form of caffeine tablets
5559.29 or energy drinks, et cetera.
5562.17 Across the board, one
finds that caffeine intake
5565.61 at a level of 1 to 3 milligrams
per kilogram of body weight
5568.85 improves reaction time.
5571.13 That is, it reduces
the amount of time
5573.02 to take a physical action or
to answer a question correctly
5578.63 with a verbal response.
5581.0 It can also improve
coordination.
5582.77 It can also improve
memory, although I
5585.38 do want to mention that, whereas
most studies of the effects
5588.92 of caffeine on improving
mental and physical performance
5592.22 involve taking caffeine at 1
to 3 milligrams per kilogram
5596.48 of body weight before the
mental task or physical task,
5600.53 there is also a pro-performance
effect of caffeine on memory
5604.61 if one takes caffeine after
learning certain material
5608.3 or I should say being
exposed to certain material.
5611.87 We'll come back to
that in a few minutes.
5614.61 If one examines reaction
time, mood, alertness, focus,
5620.95 and memory or the
ability to call up
5624.16 information from memory, or
physical dexterity, power
5628.63 output, endurance, and
overall feelings of well-being
5633.46 during exercise and
exertion, caffeine
5637.36 has been shown in numerous
studies in both men and women
5640.9 to improve all of those
metrics significantly.
5644.3 So this is all just
to say that caffeine
5647.86 is an incredible
performance-enhancing tool.
5650.26 Now, what's not obvious from
the statement that caffeine is
5653.83 a performance-enhancing
tool across the board
5656.05 and in men and women and
in different contexts
5658.96 is that the way in
which caffeine is taken
5662.14 is very important.
5664.41 Because 90% or more of
adults consume caffeine,
5670.22 finding controls for studies of
caffeine is really challenging.
5674.21 That is, finding people
who don't ingest caffeine
5676.7 regularly is a very challenging
task for the researcher.
5680.54 And as a consequence,
many of the studies
5682.88 of caffeine on
human beings involve
5685.22 depriving regular
caffeine users of caffeine
5688.73 and then examining the
effects of caffeine
5691.67 given after a period of, say,
5 to 15 days of abstinence
5695.99 in a person that is essentially
experiencing mild withdrawal
5700.07 symptoms because they haven't
had the caffeine that they were
5702.62 used to getting.
5703.34 So this is an important point.
5704.75 And it's a point that
likely exacerbates
5707.6 the observed pro-performance
effects of caffeine.
5711.15 Now all of that isn't
necessarily a problem,
5713.18 provided you keep it in mind.
5715.13 And it actually points
to a way in which
5718.43 even if you're a
regular caffeine user,
5720.59 you can extract more of
the benefits of caffeine.
5723.17 The simplest way to
do this, for instance,
5725.12 is to look back to what we
talked about earlier in terms
5729.02 of the need to have most of your
cortisol increase restricted
5732.83 to the hour or hours just
after waking in terms of mood
5736.43 and alertness and performance.
5738.29 One of the ways to increase
the peak of that cortisol
5741.86 early in the day is to
consume caffeine shortly
5746.21 after that peak occurs.
5748.22 And this was really
nicely demonstrated
5750.32 in a study entitled
caffeine stimulation
5752.96 of cortisol secretion across
the waking hours in relation
5755.87 to caffeine intake levels.
5757.61 We will provide a
link to this study.
5759.38 It's a somewhat
complicated study
5761.33 because they looked at a bunch
of different times of day
5763.88 for caffeine intake.
5765.47 And I should mention,
in this study,
5767.27 they use this 300 milligrams per
day or 600 milligrams per day.
5771.19 So that's quite high, although
for people of sufficient body
5773.69 weight and who are accustomed
to taking caffeine,
5775.94 it's certainly not
going to be in excess
5778.28 of what a lot of people
out there are taking.
5780.32 But basically, what they
observed was the following.
5784.73 Cortisol responses to
caffeine are reduced but not
5787.55 eliminated in people who consume
caffeine on a daily basis.
5791.06 What this means is
that, if you wake up--
5793.85 as I recommended
earlier, you avoid
5795.95 drinking caffeine for the first
90 to 120 minutes after waking,
5799.55 but you do get some sunlight or
other bright light in your eyes
5802.52 in that time, maybe
even get some exercise
5805.04 in that time, which
would be even better--
5806.79 and then you ingest caffeine,
you will get a further increase
5810.02 in cortisol, which,
provided it's restricted
5812.93 to the early part of the day,
is a good thing overall for mood
5815.69 and alertness.
5816.57 So this is a simple
performance-enhancing tool,
5820.05 which is to stack
caffeine on the tail
5822.05 of that early cortisol peak.
5824.36 I should also mention,
however, that, in this study,
5826.8 they had people do a five-day
caffeine abstinence prior
5830.9 to being tested with 300
milligrams or 600 milligrams
5834.71 of caffeine.
5835.53 So the simple tool to extract
from this and other studies
5838.22 like it is that, if
you want to experience
5840.32 the maximum alertness-promoting
effects of caffeine
5843.44 when you ingest it
early in the day,
5845.67 you would abstain from
caffeine for five days
5848.12 and then ingest caffeine 90
to 120 minutes after waking.
5851.182 I would still hope that you
were doing all the other things
5853.64 that I described-- morning
sunlight, exercise, et cetera--
5856.057 correctly.
5856.64 But regardless, it's very clear
that a five-day abstinence
5860.06 from caffeine however
painful that might be
5862.7 will increase the
performance-enhancing effects
5865.13 of caffeine when you take
caffeine on that sixth day.
5868.13 Now, I'm sure many of you out
there are saying, why would
5870.77 I ever want to abstain
from caffeine for five days
5873.53 in order to just get this
six-day performance-enhancing
5876.35 effect?
5877.04 Well, there are a couple
of reasons for doing that.
5879.165 Perhaps you're planning to
travel to a new time zone,
5882.84 and you want to use
caffeine as a stimulant
5884.87 to stay up during the
day in the new time zone.
5887.36 That's a somewhat unusual case.
5889.04 Others of you
might be interested
5890.48 in the pro-physical performance
effects of caffeine.
5893.807 We'll talk more about
these in a little bit.
5895.64 But you want to get
the maximum strength
5897.83 increase or the maximum
endurance increase
5900.23 from ingesting, in this
case, 300 to 600 milligrams
5904.46 of caffeine.
5905.06 Well, in that case, abstaining
from caffeine for five days
5907.61 will greatly exacerbate
the pro-performance effects
5911.15 of caffeine when you take
it on that sixth day,
5913.76 although admittedly,
those five days are
5915.56 likely to be pretty painful if
you're a regular caffeine user.
5918.41 Another variation
on this, however,
5920.1 might be to have the
amount of caffeine
5922.49 that you ingest on a daily
basis and then go back
5925.43 to your regular level of
caffeine intake on that
5928.07 day in which you need the
caffeine to really boost
5930.29 your mood, energy,
and performance.
5931.94 Another reason why you might
want to abstain from caffeine
5934.705 or reduce your caffeine
intake for a period of time
5936.83 and then go back to your
regular caffeine intake
5939.14 is simply to identify how
much of an effect caffeine
5943.28 is really having on your overall
level of daily functioning
5947.48 and mood.
5948.05 This was something
that was actually
5949.1 covered in beautiful detail
in a book by Michael Pollan
5951.74 all about caffeine.
5952.97 It's available on Audible.
5954.23 I really enjoyed that book.
5956.21 It describes his experience
with the decision
5958.88 to completely
abstain from caffeine
5960.92 for a period of months, although
I confess that after hearing
5965.21 that book, what it
basically made me want to do
5967.19 is never quit drinking
caffeine because it sounded
5969.44 as if, at least my
interpretation was, that
5971.54 even after several weeks
or months of abstaining
5973.88 from caffeine, that
he still fantasized
5976.28 about the effects of caffeine.
5977.93 But he did mention that, when
returning to ingesting caffeine
5981.62 after a period of
long abstinence,
5983.63 that it had almost a--
5986.45 let's not call it a
psychedelic property,
5988.55 but it had such
obvious effects on mood
5992.69 and alertness and
feelings of well-being
5994.79 that it really highlighted
for him the extent
5997.13 to which caffeine normally was
allowing him to just function
6000.04 what he thought was normally.
6001.33 So in other words,
many of us don't even
6003.43 really know what our
normal basal level
6005.74 of cognitive and
physical functioning
6007.96 is because we're
ingesting caffeine
6009.46 on such a regular basis.
6010.81 I confess that, as much
as I enjoyed that book
6013.33 and as intriguing as his
description of caffeine
6016.42 abstinence and then the
return to caffeine was,
6018.82 I don't intend to ever
find out personally.
6020.95 Now a very good
reason why you might
6022.81 want to abstain from caffeine
for a deliberate period of time
6025.51 and then return
to caffeine intake
6028.27 is for its physical
performance-enhancing effects.
6032.84 And here we can look to a
really interesting study.
6035.445 The title of which
is "Time course
6037.222 of tolerance to the performance
effects of caffeine."
6039.43 And what I like about this
study is that, while yes,
6041.77 it does say that
abstaining from caffeine
6043.78 and then returning
to caffeine intake
6045.52 can enhance physical performance
in a very specific way,
6048.65 it also says that, if you
take caffeine regularly,
6050.92 you can still see the physical
performance-enhancing effects
6053.86 of caffeine.
6054.64 Although they are not quite
as robust as they would be had
6058.195 you abstained from caffeine.
6060.82 The design of the study
is pretty straightforward.
6064.01 They had people either
ingest 3 milligrams
6066.49 per kilogram of caffeine
for 20 consecutive days.
6069.583 Many people are already
doing that, I realize,
6071.5 but they had people
do that or ensure
6073.357 that they were doing that.
6074.44 Or others ingested a
placebo for 20 days,
6077.65 so they abstained from
caffeine without realizing it.
6080.75 Then after that 20 days of
either ingesting caffeine
6085.36 or a placebo, their
peak performance
6089.59 was measured in terms
of aerobic output.
6092.02 But prior to that measurement,
they had caffeine, OK?
6094.78 So it's 20 days of caffeine
and then a 21st day of caffeine
6098.08 and then the physical
task on that 21st day.
6100.66 Or it's 20 days of
abstinence from caffeine.
6103.42 And then on day 21,
you get caffeine,
6105.34 and you get the
same physical test.
6106.96 And what they discovered was
that the ingestion of caffeine
6111.55 increased peak performance
in this aerobic output
6115.65 dramatically if people had
abstained from caffeine.
6120.18 But for people that had consumed
caffeine all the way through up
6124.29 until that day, it still was
effective to ingest caffeine
6128.55 on day 21 but not as effective
as it would have been had
6132.75 they abstained.
6134.01 And in fact, the
magnitude of what
6137.37 they call ergogenic
effect, which
6139.74 is the pro-performance-enhancing
effect of caffeine,
6142.65 was higher on the first
day than in subsequent days
6146.842 when they allowed people to
continue caffeine intake.
6149.05 So the takeaway from this study
is really straightforward.
6151.36 If you want to get the maximum
physical performance-enhancing
6153.902 effects of caffeine, you abstain
from caffeine for 20 days.
6157.86 Then on day 21,
when you're going
6159.84 to do the physical
thing, the task,
6162.12 you ingest caffeine about
30 minutes to an hour
6165.18 before you do that
physical challenge.
6168.66 Now 20 days of
abstinence is going
6170.19 to be rough for a lot of people.
6171.523 I certainly don't want to
sign up for this study.
6174.512 In which case, you might want
to do five days of abstinence
6176.97 as we talked about before.
6178.36 And then on day six is the day
that you ingest caffeine and do
6182.01 the physical task.
6183.432 There are even some
studies showing
6184.89 that you can abstain from
caffeine for just two days,
6187.32 for just 48 hours.
6189.0 And, in particular, if you are
a regular user of caffeine,
6192.99 this allows you
to, on day three,
6195.78 ingest caffeine at the dose
that's appropriate for you
6198.75 and do the physical, or I should
mention mental performance task
6202.74 and perform significantly
better than those
6205.5 that have been taking caffeine
throughout the entire period
6208.44 leading up to the challenge.
6210.09 So you don't necessarily
need to abstain for 20 days
6213.27 in order to get the
pro-performance effects
6215.37 of caffeine on day 21.
6216.72 You could do five days of
abstinence prior or even
6218.91 two days of abstinence prior.
6220.2 Or if that's intolerable
to you as it is in my mind,
6223.47 to me, to just reduce your
caffeine intake slightly
6226.86 or even perhaps have it
if you can tolerate that
6230.07 in the week or two weeks
or maybe even three
6233.4 weeks preceding some
physical or mental challenge.
6235.83 Now again, this sort of
implies that you're going up
6238.47 against a marathon,
or you're going up
6240.06 against a series of long
tests, maybe standardized tests
6243.63 in one day.
6244.59 There, I just really
want to point out
6246.21 that there is an abundant
literature showing that people
6249.03 perform best on mental tests
if they are in the state
6253.62 that they were when they
studied for that material.
6257.17 Now in college, I knew
a number of people
6259.027 who took this to the extreme,
thinking that if they were
6261.36 to study under the
effects of alcohol,
6263.25 that they would be best
off consuming alcohol
6266.16 prior to taking exams.
6267.54 And it turns out
to not be the case.
6269.16 Here we're talking,
in particular, about
6271.17 psychostimulant effects of
caffeine and other compounds.
6274.72 So don't think
that you can drink
6276.93 or be under the influence
of THC and then take--
6280.118 when you study and then take an
exam under the same influence
6282.66 and do just as well as you would
had you not ingested anything.
6284.82 Please don't let
that be the takeaway.
6286.59 However, do let
it be the takeaway
6289.41 that caffeine's
effects are made more
6291.54 potent by a brief to not so
brief period of abstinence
6295.11 prior to taking a
dosage of caffeine.
6297.51 And then the final
point to make is
6299.79 that, if you are somebody who
is not accustomed to drinking
6302.255 caffeine, meaning you're
hypersensitive to caffeine
6304.38 or you don't regularly
ingest caffeine, please
6306.66 do not ingest
caffeine on the day
6308.64 of any important mental
or physical challenge
6310.98 or performance, because
what you will find
6312.81 is that because you are
not caffeine-adapted,
6315.12 you will experience changes
in your thermal regulation,
6318.24 in your levels of
anxiety and jitteriness,
6320.802 and your levels of
focus that could
6322.26 be very detrimental to mental
or physical performance.
6325.78 So you don't want to throw
yourself in the deep end
6328.38 by ingesting caffeine if
you're not used to it.
6330.6 And I should mention
that for people
6332.1 that are not accustomed
to ingesting caffeine
6334.11 or are very sensitive
to caffeine.
6335.86 Even 25 to 50 milligrams
of caffeine in the amount
6339.217 that's found in, for
instance, a piece
6340.8 of certain types of chocolate
can actually cause anxiety.
6344.16 So be careful there.
6345.33 Here, I'm referring only to
people that are accustomed
6347.58 with caffeine intake.
6348.9 So what I recommend is to
explore the ergogenic effects
6353.4 of caffeine during your training
and then to make a decision
6356.58 about what you can
reasonably and reliably do
6359.16 in terms of abstinence and
then pulse with caffeine
6362.4 on the day of the challenge.
6364.035 I get a lot of questions
as to whether or not
6365.91 caffeine has different
effects on the nervous system
6368.077 and on performance in
particular, depending on phases
6370.71 of the menstrual cycle.
6372.605 So I explored that in my
research for this episode,
6374.73 and I found two
studies both of which
6376.557 we will reference in
the show note captions.
6378.39 The first one is entitled
"Caffeine consumption
6381.63 and menstrual function."
6382.78 So it's actually the
relationship between caffeine
6384.9 and menstrual function.
6385.59 We will do an entire episode
about the menstrual cycle
6387.96 and menstrual function.
6388.953 But the other one as it
relates to performance
6390.87 was published in 2020 in the
European Journal of Nutrition,
6394.33 which is "Ergogenic
effects of caffeine
6396.943 on peak aerobic cycling power
during the menstrual cycle."
6399.36 And the basic takeaway
of this study is--
6402.54 frankly, a very nice study,
showed that quote, "Caffeine
6405.72 increased peak aerobic cycling
power in the early follicular,
6409.71 preovulatory, and midluteal
phases of the menstrual cycle."
6413.56 Thus, the ingestion--
and again, here they
6415.31 use 3 milligrams of caffeine
per kilogram of body mass
6419.01 might be considered an
ergogenic aid for women
6423.38 who are in the menstrual
cycle during all three
6426.02 phases of their cycle.
6427.29 So keep that in mind, women--
6429.32 for those of you that are
regular users of caffeine
6431.57 or you're using caffeine to
enhance physical performance,
6434.33 there does not seem to be any
menstrual cycle phase-dependent
6438.08 effects of caffeine
on performance.
6440.27 That is, caffeine seems
to always increase
6442.73 physical performance
regardless of the phase
6445.248 of the menstrual cycle
you might happen to be in.
6447.29 I'd like to touch on a little
bit more of the use of caffeine
6451.19 for enhancing
mental performance.
6453.08 Yes, it is the case that
ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams
6457.04 of caffeine per kilogram of
body weight in the 30 minutes
6460.31 or so prior to
doing a memory task
6462.89 or sitting down to
doing some studying
6465.59 or learning of any kind,
physical or mental performance,
6469.61 of any kind is beneficial
for all the reasons we talked
6472.88 about before, relate to dopamine
and acetylcholine, et cetera.
6476.96 But it turns out that
it is also the case that
6480.89 spiking one's adrenaline
and other so-called
6484.13 catecholamines-- so this would
be dopamine, norepinephrine,
6486.63 and epinephrine-- after
a bout of learning
6490.73 can greatly enhance
memory for the information
6493.67 that one was trying to learn.
6495.42 That's right.
6496.4 Spiking your adrenaline
after learning
6499.07 can greatly increase
memory for the material
6502.37 you're trying to learn.
6504.0 In fact, this is a practice that
dates back centuries and was
6507.59 written about in a beautiful
Annual Review of Neuroscience
6511.28 on the biology of memory by
James McGaugh, where he talks
6514.16 about medieval
practices of children
6517.34 being taught information and
then being thrown literally
6520.16 into cold water to stimulate
the release of adrenaline
6523.46 and that increase in adrenaline.
6526.1 While the mechanism wasn't
completely understood,
6528.44 it was understood that
that sort of shock
6531.17 to the system from
the cold water
6533.33 led to better memory and
retention of the information
6537.53 that these children
had been exposed to.
6539.258 And it turns out
the exact same thing
6540.8 is true for adults
in the laboratory
6543.02 or kids in the laboratory.
6544.19 And here I'm not
suggesting throwing anyone
6546.02 into cold water.
6546.687 If you want to get
into cold water,
6548.24 there's a reason we
call it deliberate
6549.93 cold exposure on the
podcast is that it
6551.922 should be deliberate and
controlled by you, not
6553.88 by somebody else.
6554.81 And if it's controlled
by somebody else,
6556.477 that might be military
screening or something.
6559.11 But here we're talking about
deliberately increasing
6563.03 your levels of adrenaline and
other catecholamines, dopamine,
6566.55 norepinephrine, et cetera.
6568.16 You can do that certainly
by deliberate cold exposure
6570.98 with a cold shower or
getting in up to your neck
6574.13 in cold water of any kind.
6576.23 But the other way to do that
is to spike your adrenaline
6579.5 by ingesting 1 to 3 milligrams
per kilogram of caffeine
6584.66 after sitting down to try and
learn some material I confess
6588.59 that, more often than not, I
use caffeine in the same way
6591.2 that most people
use it, which is OK.
6592.903 I'm going to sit down.
6593.82 I'm going to research
information for a podcast
6596.51 or assemble some information
for a paper or grant,
6600.05 and I want to focus.
6601.07 So I will drink a cup of
coffee at the beginning of that
6604.91 and maybe even throughout
that or a couple of yerba maté
6607.61 at the beginning
or throughout that.
6609.11 Or I'll sip on one or both
throughout trying to learn.
6613.01 And that works
quite well in terms
6615.74 of maintaining focus and
alertness and retention
6619.37 of information, but
it is indeed the case.
6622.25 That is, the research
supports the fact.
6624.08 And I've experienced
the fact that,
6625.76 if I abstain from caffeine while
I'm trying to learn something--
6628.76 but then I drink caffeine
immediately after.
6631.97 Somewhat surprisingly to me
but certainly in a way that's
6635.57 consistent with the
research literature, memory
6639.14 for the information that I was
focused on prior to ingesting
6643.34 that caffeine is much greater.
6644.827 And here I'm talking about
as a personal anecdote,
6646.91 but this is actually what the
data point to both in animals
6649.37 and in humans.
6650.84 And if you think about
it, it makes perfect sense
6652.91 because the way that the
memory systems of the brain
6656.78 are organized is that we go
through life experiencing
6659.76 things.
6660.26 We encounter surprises
both good and bad.
6662.75 We go through the motions of
things both typical, mundane,
6667.16 exciting, and novel,
and not novel.
6671.332 And then every once
in a while, something
6673.04 will happen that will
spike our catecholamines.
6675.47 Dopamine, typically if
it's a positive surprise.
6679.01 Adrenaline, which
can be associated
6680.69 with both positive
surprise or positive events
6683.39 and negative events
or surprises.
6686.39 And without fail, increases
in the catecholamines
6691.4 tend to lock in
memories for things
6694.67 that preceded the increase
in those catecholamines.
6697.19 Again, the catecholamines
being dopamine, epinephrine,
6699.68 and norepinephrine, sometimes
all three in combination,
6702.05 sometimes just two of those,
sometimes just one of those,
6704.425 depending on the experience.
6706.35 So it makes perfect
sense that using caffeine
6709.55 at the end of a
learning bout would
6712.22 enhance our memory
for the information
6714.483 that we are trying to learn.
6715.65 So if you decide that you
want to try and extract
6718.22 this performance-enhancing
effect of caffeine, what
6720.71 I recommend would be to try and
abstain from caffeine for a day
6725.36 or two prior.
6726.05 But if you can't,
you just continue
6727.64 with your normal
caffeine intake.
6729.23 But then when you sit down
to study or learn something
6731.99 to not ingest any caffeine as
you do that but then afterward
6736.94 to ingest caffeine.
6738.21 Now in theory, you could
probably further enhance
6740.57 the memory encoding
effects of adrenaline
6743.36 and the other catecholamines
by drinking caffeine
6745.94 and then taking a cold shower or
doing deliberate cold exposure
6749.39 if you really wanted to
or had the ability to
6751.52 or doing some sort of
intense form of exercise.
6754.79 And we'll talk in
a moment about how
6756.29 caffeine, exercise, and the
adrenaline system interact.
6760.04 But as a brief but
relevant to side,
6762.83 brief bouts of intense exercise
ranging from 10 to 50 minutes
6767.18 or so have been shown to
improve memory for information
6771.11 that one was trying to learn
prior to the intense exercise.
6774.14 This is work from Dr.
Wendy Suzuki's lab at NYU
6777.98 as well as other
laboratories, some of the work
6780.5 that's being done at Stanford
in the Mind, Body Laboratories.
6784.665 And our laboratory points in
the direction of these kinds
6787.04 of effects as well.
6788.76 They all come back to the
same general neurochemical
6792.68 theme, which is that,
when we experience
6795.29 an increase in these
catecholamines that include
6798.08 adrenaline, dopamine,
and norepinephrine,
6801.08 the memory systems of the
brain flip on in a way that
6804.58 try to capture the information
and the perceptions
6808.18 and the experiences that we
were exposed to just prior
6811.78 to the increase in
catecholamines and caffeine
6815.2 but also exercise
and also cold water.
6817.45 And, of course, any of those
alone or in combination
6821.2 all increase the levels
of catecholamines,
6823.55 so it makes perfect
logical mechanistic sense
6826.15 as to why this would work.
6827.5 And in fact, it does work.
6828.82 If you want to remember
specific information,
6831.34 you might consider using
caffeine as you move through
6834.01 and absorb and are exposed
to that information.
6836.11 But you might also
consider using caffeine
6839.44 after being exposed
to that information
6841.45 because studies in
animals and humans
6843.46 show that that is a potent way
to increase memory for what
6846.88 you are just exposed to.
6848.23 I should mention that
what I just described also
6850.36 pushes back on something that
I know a number of people
6853.03 perhaps have heard about
and maybe even use, which is
6856.03 this notion of the nappuccino.
6857.402 I remember hearing about
this a few years back.
6859.36 It was sort of
trend, if you will.
6862.87 The trend involved
drinking a cup of coffee
6865.24 or a double espresso and then
going down for a nap typically
6868.27 in the afternoon
and then waking up.
6869.77 And the idea was that the
caffeine would hit your system
6872.2 right at the time that
you awake from the nap
6874.09 and that you would be better
able to focus and exercise.
6878.17 There are a couple of things
about that practice that I
6880.6 don't like.
6881.29 First of all, it
implies, in most cases,
6884.65 that you're napping
and ingesting
6887.32 caffeine in the afternoon, which
I realize for many students
6891.043 and for people that are
comfortable staying up
6892.96 until the wee hours of the
night and then waking up
6895.33 late the next day might be
compatible with their schedule.
6898.94 But again, because of the
sleep-diminishing effects
6902.56 of caffeine--
6904.09 and we talked about earlier.
6905.41 I'm not crazy about
the idea of people
6907.18 ingesting caffeine
in the late afternoon
6909.16 in order to perform better
in the late afternoon.
6912.01 Far better would be to
restrict caffeine intake
6914.08 to the early part of the day
as we talked about earlier.
6916.49 The other reason
is that the data
6919.42 on things like
non-sleep deep rest
6922.18 and naps in the afternoon--
and again, the rule here
6926.14 is that you don't have to nap.
6927.43 But if you want
to nap, it's been
6928.96 shown that naps of
90 minutes or less
6931.3 or non-sleep deep rest
protocols-- and you
6933.49 can find those-- for instance,
there's one with me speaking.
6935.99 You just put NSDR
Huberman into YouTube.
6938.38 You can hear that.
6939.13 It's completely zero cost.
6940.21 There are other NSDR
scripts out there
6941.793 now, of course, if you prefer
those, that those can all
6945.16 lead to increases in one
of the catecholamines
6948.79 at least, which is dopamine.
6950.86 That's been shown in a really
nice neurotransmitter labeling
6955.36 study, not from my laboratory,
but from another laboratory,
6957.88 but also can improve mood,
focus, and alertness on its own
6961.51 without the need to
ingest caffeine prior
6963.85 to going into those states.
6965.29 And in fact, ingesting
caffeine prior to a nap
6967.81 or ingesting caffeine
prior to NSDR
6970.33 is most certainly going to
reduce the effectiveness
6974.2 of that nap and
NSDR in restoring
6976.42 natural levels of
alertness and focus
6978.283 that would lead to the
performance-enhancing effect.
6980.45 So I'm not such a fan of
the so-called nappuccino,
6982.78 although if any of you
out there have derived
6984.91 great benefit from
it, definitely
6986.41 let me know your protocol
and what you've experienced.
6988.81 Put it in the comment
section if you would.
6991.93 I'd appreciate that.
6993.01 There's another very important
and potent use of caffeine
6996.07 for enhancing performance.
6997.66 And this relates not just to
the dopamine and epinephrine
7002.19 and the arousal-inducing
effects of caffeine.
7005.79 And it doesn't even just relate
to the effect of caffeine
7010.11 on enhancing frontal
lobe function.
7011.8 It does include all
that, but it also
7013.68 includes those reinforcing
effects of caffeine
7016.86 that we talked about at the
beginning of the episode.
7019.83 And the best way to illustrate
these performance-enhancing
7023.01 effects of caffeine
that stem directly
7025.38 from its association
with reinforcement
7028.89 is to highlight a study.
7030.51 And the title of the study
is "Blood dopamine level
7033.09 enhanced by caffeine in men
after treadmill running."
7036.33 And as the title suggests,
this was carried out in men,
7039.09 but there's no reason to think
that the same results wouldn't
7042.45 also be present in women.
7044.38 There are some sex-dependent
effects of caffeine.
7046.59 I'll touch on just
briefly at the end.
7048.25 But those are largely
present in kids.
7051.48 That is, adolescents and
teens as opposed to adults.
7055.21 So this study is
really interesting.
7057.0 What they had people do was
run on a treadmill and either
7060.87 ingest caffeine-- again, 3
milligrams per kilogram of body
7064.8 weight--
7065.56 or to not ingest caffeine.
7067.77 And then they looked
at levels of dopamine
7070.65 and other neurotransmitters
and hormones,
7073.26 such as prolactin and cortisol.
7075.42 And the basic takeaway
is, as the title suggests,
7078.3 that exercise, while on its
own, can increase cortisol
7082.44 in healthy ways, provided it's
not too intense and too long.
7085.89 A little note here, if you
have trouble recovering
7089.028 from exercise or
you want to continue
7090.57 to derive the benefits from
exercise, in general, best not
7094.56 to do high-intensity exercise
for longer than 75 minutes.
7097.95 Or 90 minutes probably
being the outer threshold.
7100.368 I realized that there are
some genetic freaks out there
7102.66 or people that are
chemically assisted
7104.243 that can recover from very
intense long bouts of exercise.
7107.4 But most people don't do
well through long bouts
7111.66 of intense exercise
on a regular basis.
7113.52 And limiting their
intense exercise
7115.92 to 60 minutes or less--
7117.893 that doesn't include
the warm-up--
7119.31 is going to be beneficial.
7120.393 See the episode on
tool kit for fitness
7123.12 if you'd like details on that.
7125.46 Exercise is known to increase
levels of dopamine, cortisol,
7129.51 and other catecholamines and
neurotransmitters very potently
7133.86 and things like
testosterone and estrogen
7135.69 in ways that we know
are beneficial to us
7137.13 and, of course, have all
these positive effects
7139.11 on the musculoskeletal system
and cardiovascular effects.
7142.14 But unbeknownst to most
people, ingesting 3 milligrams
7147.63 per kilogram of caffeine
prior to exercise further
7150.6 increases the dopamine release
associated with exercise
7154.14 specifically.
7155.31 And this has two
important effects.
7157.39 First of all, that
increase in dopamine
7159.42 is great because it provides
a long-lasting increase
7162.87 in focus alertness
and motivation,
7164.79 not just during the exercise,
but also after the exercise.
7168.9 And second, it-- that
is, caffeine and dopamine
7174.08 in combination--
act as a reinforcer
7176.45 to make the experience of
exercise and the period
7179.61 immediate after exercise
more pleasant and, in fact,
7183.33 reinforcing.
7184.32 So in other words, one
way to enjoy exercise more
7188.72 and to enjoy the activities
that follow exercise more
7192.02 and to experience a genuine
increase in dopamine that's
7195.53 beneficial for
mood and alertness
7197.96 is to ingest caffeine
prior to exercise.
7202.1 Now this is important because
a number of people out there
7205.76 are exercising, love
exercise, love eating great,
7209.593 love doing all the
things that are
7211.01 beneficial for their health,
but a number of people out there
7213.56 really don't like to exercise.
7215.42 And that serves as a serious
block for their willingness
7220.04 and their consistency
to exercise.
7224.91 Ingesting caffeine gives
us energy to exercise.
7228.21 It increases the release of
neurochemicals and hormones
7231.48 that are good for
us during exercise.
7233.34 But as I'm highlighting
here, it also
7236.49 increases the
reinforcement pathways
7239.58 associated with exercise.
7241.74 That is, it creates
a positive feeling
7244.86 about the general theme
of engaging in exercise,
7248.25 and it creates a general
positive experience
7251.52 of the things that
follow exercise.
7253.54 So I think this, if nothing
else is a call for or support
7258.3 for the idea, that
ingesting caffeine
7260.43 as a performance-enhancing
tool makes perfect sense.
7263.47 But for those out there
that don't enjoy exercise,
7266.13 in particular, certain
forms of exercise,
7268.47 ingesting caffeine can
change your relationship
7271.68 to that exercise.
7273.31 In other words, make it more
positive, much in the same way
7276.24 that ingesting caffeine
alongside a certain taste that
7279.69 would otherwise be neutral
or maybe even negative
7281.91 can actually make the taste of
that particular drink or food
7285.09 positive.
7285.85 So again, this brings us back
to the reinforcing properties
7288.39 of caffeine that
are subconscious.
7290.68 It's not just about the
enhanced performance in the test
7294.33 or the enhanced performance
on the treadmill
7296.64 or with the weights in the gym.
7298.5 It's enhanced feelings
of mood and well-being
7300.6 that are genuine because
of the effect of caffeine
7303.24 on certain neurotransmitter
and hormone systems,
7305.73 but it also is creating
an overall milieu
7308.82 of reinforcing all
of the things that
7311.04 led in to occur during
and occur after exercise.
7315.41 I do want to point out something
that's very important as it
7317.91 relates to combining
things like caffeine
7321.75 and exercise in order
to increase dopamine.
7323.925 This is something that
came up in the episode
7325.8 that I did on dopamine,
motivation, and drive, which
7328.56 turns out to be one of
our most popular episodes.
7331.05 Again, you can find that at
hubermanlab.com and links
7333.84 to all formats with
time stamps, et cetera.
7335.7 This also came up in
the episode on ADHD
7338.79 because of the relationship
between ADHD and dopamine.
7341.58 And that's this notion
of dopamine stacking.
7344.55 In the episode on dopamine,
motivation, and drive,
7347.82 I pointed out that, while there
are a near-infinite number
7351.12 of things that can
increase dopamine release,
7354.0 most notably positive surprise
or positive anticipation
7359.19 or experiencing a win.
7361.17 Certainly, there are compounds,
both drugs of abuse, food, sex,
7366.72 and certain supplements
that can increase dopamine
7368.82 to varying levels and
to varying degrees,
7370.95 both healthy and unhealthy.
7372.688 That's all contained in
that episode on dopamine,
7374.73 motivation, and drive.
7375.81 But what I pointed
out is that, if you
7377.7 are somebody who tends
to experience difficulty
7380.91 with motivation-- that
so-called dopamine
7383.49 stacking as I called
it might be something
7385.682 that you want to avoid.
7386.64 What's dopamine stacking?
7387.69 Dopamine stacking
would be combining
7390.21 a highly caffeinated energy
drink that also includes
7393.72 the amino acid tyrosine, which
is a precursor to dopamine,
7396.93 plus loud music plus getting
yourself really ramped up
7399.75 then an intense workout.
7401.16 All of that can be great if you
do it every once in a while.
7404.8 But what you will quickly find
is that the extent to which
7408.21 your dopamine
peaks also dictates
7411.54 the extent to which
your dopamine will
7413.28 drop after that peak.
7414.69 And when I say drop, I
mean drop below baseline.
7416.702 So a lot of people find that,
if they stack a lot of things
7419.16 to peak their dopamine,
then they experience a low,
7422.94 and it does take some time for
them to return to baseline.
7425.85 And I highly recommend
not engaging in activities
7429.54 or consuming compounds that
are in attempt to accelerate
7434.13 that return to baseline
because all it will do
7436.17 is drive that baseline
lower and lower.
7438.58 So this requires
being able to tolerate
7440.25 a drop in dopamine baseline for
a period of time, et cetera.
7442.975 Now the reason I'm
bringing this up now
7444.6 in the context of
this caffeine episode
7446.34 is I just described a study
in which using caffeine
7449.55 prior to exercise increases
dopamine after exercise.
7452.43 And so you might be
saying, especially
7454.563 if you heard that earlier
episode, wait, isn't
7456.48 that dopamine stacking?
7458.1 Aren't you encouraging
me to stack my dopamine?
7460.47 Well, in some sense, yes.
7462.0 But keep in mind,
I'm not suggesting
7463.59 that you do this every
time you exercise.
7465.61 So just as in that
earlier episode,
7467.28 I emphasized the fact
that, while stacking
7470.1 multiple stimuli--
7472.23 caffeine or energy drinks
and music and et cetera--
7476.44 for exercise or for mental
work or for any experience
7479.2 for that matter is OK to do
every once in a while for most
7482.11 people, you don't want to
get in the habit of doing it
7484.36 consistently every
time you exercise
7487.33 or every time you go
out, for instance.
7489.74 And so you really
want to be cautious.
7491.59 That is, you want to
protect your both baseline
7493.6 levels of dopamine and your
peak levels of dopamine.
7496.99 That said, for people
that want to experience
7499.36 an increase in mood,
alertness, and performance,
7501.67 or who want to
condition themselves--
7503.38 because that's
really what it is.
7504.755 It's conditioning yourself
by the reinforcing effects
7506.98 of dopamine to increase
your liking or maybe even
7512.68 your loving of exercise.
7514.33 Occasionally, using
caffeine or frequently
7517.42 using caffeine prior to exercise
is fine but be very careful.
7521.08 And by being very
careful, what I mean
7523.03 is pay attention to how you
feel in the hours and days
7526.39 after that dopamine
increase wears off.
7529.69 So for instance, if you ingest
caffeine and then exercise
7533.53 very intensely and you're
feeling great afterwards
7536.26 but then eight hours
later or the next day,
7538.6 you're feeling a
little bit low, I
7540.072 suggest you don't go back and
do the exact same thing right
7542.53 away.
7542.86 I would give yourself
a little bit of time
7544.75 to let that baseline of
dopamine return to normal.
7548.24 So again, stacking
different things,
7550.87 chemical and behavioral, in
order to increase dopamine
7553.81 can be done in a safe way
that's beneficial to you,
7556.03 depending on your goals.
7557.17 But be careful about not
stacking too many stimuli
7561.04 for dopamine too often.
7562.96 That's the key.
7563.8 Early in the
episode, I mentioned
7565.27 one possible
caffeine-consuming schedule
7568.9 that works very well that
doesn't fortunately subject you
7572.17 to long 20-day bouts or 5-day or
even 2-day bouts of abstinence.
7577.18 And that's the every other
day schedule of caffeine.
7580.18 If you look at the
half-life of caffeine
7582.94 and you look at its effects
on the dopamine system
7585.94 and its
performance-enhancing effects
7588.22 and how a period of abstinence
can, in fact, increase
7591.392 the performance-enhancing
effects of caffeine--
7593.35 but also take into
consideration that caffeine
7596.23 can be habit-forming, and we
can develop a sort of tolerance
7599.35 to caffeine.
7600.37 Well then, what emerges
from all of that
7602.92 is that being a person
who consumes caffeine
7606.8 every other day
can actually help
7609.05 you maximize most of the
positive effects of caffeine
7612.47 without subjecting you to the
kind of misery that occurs
7615.29 if you're accustomed
to consuming
7616.73 caffeine every single day and
then suddenly go into a 2 or 5
7620.63 or 20-day abstinence.
7622.07 So I myself have never tried
an every other day caffeine
7625.16 approach, although
I'm considering
7627.86 doing it based on the
literature that I've read.
7630.11 And I'm considering doing it
in a very specific way, which
7632.6 would be to only consume
caffeine on the days in which I
7635.15 resistance train.
7636.02 And since I tend to do that
about three or four days
7637.97 per week organized in a way
that's every other day-- again,
7640.428 if you want to see the exercise
schedule that I follow,
7642.78 including cardiovascular
exercise and weight
7644.613 training and all the reasons
and rationale for what I do
7647.93 and how it maps on to the
scientific literature,
7651.05 relate to health span and
lifespan, vitality, et cetera,
7653.78 you can find that
at hubermanlab.com.
7655.7 And we had a tool
kit for fitness
7657.44 that ought to be posted to
our website before long.
7660.77 The every-other-day schedule
of caffeine intake, to me,
7663.77 seems like the most
rational one if one
7665.84 wants to maximize on the
performance-enhancing effects
7668.57 of caffeine without suffering
the effects of caffeine
7672.35 withdrawal that are
associated with being
7674.81 a regular consumer of
caffeine and then stopping
7676.97 caffeine intake, such as
headache and irritability
7679.61 and so forth.
7680.42 Not I nor anyone
in my life wants
7682.395 me to experience
those effects, and I'm
7684.02 sure you don't
want to experience
7685.395 those effects for you either.
7686.803 So if you're
somebody that decides
7688.22 to try the every
other day protocol
7690.38 or you are somebody who's
already doing that protocol,
7693.29 please let me know what your
experiences with that are.
7696.56 At least by my read of
the literature on caffeine
7698.787 and it's
performance-enhancing effects
7700.37 but also the effects of caffeine
on neurotransmitter and hormone
7703.4 systems, the every-other-day
caffeine schedule
7707.0 does seem to be the most
rational and scientifically
7710.09 grounded one in order to
maximize on all those effects.
7712.97 In addition to so-called
performance-enhancing effects
7715.37 of caffeine, there are also
the well studied and now fairly
7719.84 well mechanistically understood
pro-health effects of caffeine.
7724.08 Now, here when I talk about
pro-health effects of caffeine,
7727.82 I want to be very clear that,
if your schedule of caffeine
7732.11 intake--
7732.77 that is, your timing
of caffeine intake
7734.66 or anything else
for that matter--
7737.21 offsets getting regular
high quality sleep
7741.08 of sufficient duration,
well, then you
7742.82 are undermining the pro-health
effects of that thing.
7745.28 This is true for exercise.
7746.507 This is true for caffeine.
7747.59 This is true for
supplementation.
7748.965 This is true for
prescription drugs.
7750.858 Again, you don't want to
be neurotically attached
7752.9 to the idea that you have to
get perfect sleep every night
7755.317 because that's simply not
true but is absolutely
7757.55 the case that anything, whether
or not it's good for you
7760.04 or bad for you in the short
term, that disrupts your sleep
7764.54 because of the timing in which
you're doing that thing is
7767.84 going to undermine your
immediate and long-term health
7770.54 before long.
7771.5 So with that said,
there are several well
7774.92 described health-promoting
effects of caffeine ingestion.
7779.03 And once again, when I
say caffeine ingestion,
7782.21 I'm referring to that 1 to
3 milligrams per kilogram
7784.46 of body weight dosage.
7786.8 There are really nice studies
showing that being a regular
7789.77 consumer of caffeine can help
offset some of the probability,
7794.76 some of the probability
of developing
7797.0 Parkinson's and maybe
Alzheimer's-related dementia
7799.52 as well.
7800.85 These are not terribly
controversial data
7802.94 because of the
fact that caffeine
7804.5 is known to increase the
release of those catecholamines,
7807.8 dopamine, epinephrine, and
norepinephrine, as well
7810.17 as acetylcholine.
7811.7 All those neurotransmitter
and neuromodulator systems
7814.22 are the ones that are
known to be defective
7817.763 in Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's, although there
7819.68 are other transmitter
and hormone systems that
7822.05 are defective as well.
7823.52 There are beautiful reviews
on the neuroprotective effects
7826.58 of caffeine and
neurodegenerative diseases.
7829.19 They're quite extensive.
7830.57 And I'll just refer you to one
and the references therein,
7833.42 and we'll provide a link to
this in the show note caption.
7835.837 So the title as the
topic at hand suggests
7839.32 is the neuroprotective
effects of caffeine
7841.07 and neurodegenerative diseases.
7842.67 This was published in 2016.
7844.64 I'm sure there have been
other reviews since then,
7846.8 but it includes many, many
quality references and studies,
7850.01 both in animals and in
humans, pointing to the fact
7852.29 that specific enzymes
that are associated
7854.96 with the health of, in
particular, dopamine neurons
7857.99 are made more robust by
regular ingestion of caffeine.
7862.04 It also points to the
fact that the increase
7864.95 in dopamine receptors
that is induced
7867.47 by regular ingestion of caffeine
that I referred to earlier
7870.92 is another way in which
dopamine, however many dopamine
7874.7 neurons remain around in people
with Parkinson's or people
7877.31 who are aging that lose
dopamine neurons naturally,
7880.34 that dopamine can have
its maximal effect because
7883.91 of the increase in receptors for
dopamine that caffeine induces.
7887.87 And there are other
biological mechanisms
7890.57 that further
support why caffeine
7893.06 ought to be
neuroprotective, including
7895.88 its effects on the
acetylcholine system, which
7897.95 is one of the major
systems disrupted
7900.23 in Alzheimer's dementia.
7901.892 So in other words, it
makes perfect sense
7903.6 as to why caffeine would
be neuroprotective.
7905.91 Caffeine has also been
shown to diminish headache,
7908.79 particularly when taken in
combination with aspirin.
7911.005 And that's because of the
effects of caffeine and aspirin
7913.38 on blood flow.
7914.29 There's also evidence
that caffeine
7915.81 can provide brief but
substantial relief from asthma.
7919.45 So I wouldn't want people
to rely on caffeine
7921.51 as a lifesaving approach
to an asthmatic attack.
7926.52 That said, for people that
suffer from minor asthma,
7929.25 that caffeine intake--
7930.87 again, of the dosages
that we talked
7932.37 about before has been
shown to alleviate some
7935.07 of the major symptoms
of asthma for anywhere
7936.96 from one to four hours.
7939.06 And I know this is of relevance
to a lot of people out there.
7943.59 Because caffeine increases
the catecholamines
7946.68 and in particular because
caffeine increases
7949.47 dopamine transmission in
the prefrontal cortex--
7952.24 this area of the brain that's
associated with focus and rule
7955.05 setting and context
and task switching--
7957.81 caffeine is known to
improve focus and alertness,
7962.13 in particular, in
people who have
7963.78 symptoms of ADHD or other
attention and focus issues.
7970.17 Now caffeine alone
does not appear
7972.39 to be as potent for
the treatment of ADHD
7975.6 as are things like Ritalin,
Adderall, modafinil,
7979.05 or modafinil and Vyvanse.
7981.48 If you would like a sort
of head by head comparison
7984.51 of prescription
drugs, supplements,
7988.44 and things like
caffeine as well as
7991.11 coverage of behavioral tools
and nutritional tools, et cetera
7994.77 that can positively offset
some of the symptoms of ADHD,
7999.12 please see the episode
that I did on ADHD.
8001.01 Again, that's available at
hubermanlab.com in all formats.
8003.8 But that said, caffeine
does increase focus,
8005.787 and it does it through a
number of different mechanisms,
8008.12 not the least of which is to
increase dopamine transmission
8010.85 in the forebrain just as a drug
like Ritalin or Adderall would,
8014.03 although not to the same
extent as a drug like Ritalin
8017.51 or Adderall does.
8018.59 Before we close today, I do
want to just briefly return
8021.56 to the reinforcing
effects of caffeine
8023.87 that we talked about earlier.
8025.52 This study on the
honeybees that showed
8027.17 that bees prefer certain vectors
because they contain caffeine.
8030.45 Even though they are not aware
that those vectors contain
8032.93 caffeine, they just come to like
the feeling that those nectars
8036.32 provide them so much
that they associate that
8039.86 in a subconscious way with
the flowers themselves,
8042.11 and they come to
like those flowers.
8043.61 Or human beings.
8044.78 For instance, children that
ingest caffeinated beverages
8048.23 come to adore the taste
of those beverages.
8051.41 And beautiful studies have been
done that describe how children
8056.06 and adults truly cannot
distinguish between the taste
8059.09 of a caffeinated and
noncaffeinated beverage.
8062.31 And caffeine can be placed
into essentially any beverage
8065.67 in order to give us a preference
for that beverage or food.
8069.24 In fact, the studies have
been done with yogurt.
8071.4 If you put caffeine into
yogurt of different flavors--
8075.0 even plain yogurt which
most kids don't like--
8079.38 they will come to prefer
whatever flavor contain
8083.13 the caffeine even
if then you remove
8085.65 the caffeine from that flavor.
8087.04 Now eventually, their
preference for that flavor
8089.04 will be extinguished,
but all of this
8091.35 is just to say that so many
of the things that we like,
8094.26 whether or not it's coffee or
tea or a given flavor of food
8098.31 or a given experience
or even exercise,
8102.03 occur because we ingest
caffeine in conjunction
8105.0 with those activities.
8106.69 Now these are not tricks
that your nervous system
8109.05 plays on you.
8109.63 These are real
neurochemical-reinforcing
8112.06 effects.
8112.56 And I think that we
would all do well
8114.63 to think about and to leverage
these reinforcing effects
8117.96 much in the same
way we would do well
8119.7 to think about and hopefully
not leverage aversive effects
8123.87 of certain compounds, right?
8125.22 The simple way to put
this is I or anyone
8127.95 could get you to dislike
something, someone,
8130.95 or some place by making you feel
slightly less good, lower mood.
8136.74 I don't even have to make you
feel nauseous but less good
8139.99 after ingesting
something or having
8141.91 a certain kind of interaction or
being in a certain environment,
8145.09 very straightforward to do
that, because of the way
8147.58 that your nervous system
is wired for conditioning.
8150.86 However, there's the
positive side of all this,
8152.9 which is that it's very
straightforward to reinforce
8155.98 the experience of a given
food, including its taste,
8158.95 but all the context around it,
the container, the texture,
8161.542 the people you consume it
with, where you consume it,
8163.75 et cetera.
8165.86 For instance, I
wonder why we are not
8169.13 pairing caffeine with broccoli.
8171.74 And here I'm not suggesting
that people actually
8174.14 do that experiment or
play that trick on people,
8178.04 but you have to sort of
imagine that, if caffeine
8181.4 is this incredible reinforcer
of all sorts of things,
8185.21 in particular, things that we
ingest and would want to ingest
8187.85 more of if it's paired
with caffeine, well then,
8191.18 you actually can use
caffeine as a tool
8193.549 to increase reinforcement
of different things.
8195.86 And you can avoid caffeine as a
way to further reinforce things
8201.203 that you would like to stop.
8202.37 And here I'd like to just give
the example of sugar cravings.
8204.98 A lot of people ask me, how
do I avoid sugar cravings?
8207.29 I've talked about the use
of L-glutamine for that.
8209.6 I've talked about
making sure you're
8211.1 getting enough essential fatty
acids and essential amino acids
8215.09 as a way to reduce
sugar cravings.
8218.2 Please note,
however, that if you
8219.61 are somebody who likes to have
your sugar, whether or not
8222.549 it's a piece of chocolate
or your dessert, et cetera--
8224.799 I'm not saying that's
bad, but if you're
8226.466 trying to reduce your sugar
cravings, ask yourself,
8229.36 are you ingesting sugar
along with caffeine?
8232.097 Could be the caffeine contained
in that sugar-containing food
8234.639 like chocolate.
8235.395 Or it could be
that you're having
8236.77 a cup of coffee along
with your pastry,
8238.395 and then you're struggling
with sugar cravings.
8240.575 Well, think about it.
8241.45 You're not just being reinforced
by the sugar and the effects
8244.059 of sugar on dopamine
which are real
8245.74 and both conscious
and subconscious
8247.719 through the gut to the
brain dopamine system
8249.67 and direct on the
brain dopamine system.
8251.98 But by coingesting
caffeine, you are also
8255.16 further enhancing the
reinforcing effects of sugar.
8259.48 The flip side to all of this
is that you could use caffeine
8262.27 as a way to increase your
appetite for certain things.
8265.097 I actually know somebody.
8266.139 I won't reveal who
this person is,
8267.556 but they are quite
prominent podcaster
8269.77 who ingests 125 to 150
milligrams of in tablet
8276.07 form along with herbal
tea and use this
8278.98 as a way to develop a
preference for herbal tea
8281.98 because they found that
coffee was giving them
8285.459 other effects that
weren't good for them.
8287.24 So it works quite
well in animals,
8289.33 and it works quite
well in insects.
8290.99 And it works quite
well in humans.
8292.99 I suppose animals,
insects, and humans
8294.67 are all animals at the end of
the day, so no surprise there.
8297.5 But it all underscores the
extent to which caffeine
8300.91 is an absolutely
fascinating molecule.
8303.25 I mean, its ability to
offset the sleepiness system,
8307.07 if you will, this
adenosine system,
8308.53 and to control our
schedules in that way
8310.51 to essentially take a
withdrawal against the bank that
8313.24 is adenosine and
then pay that back
8314.86 later in the form of
getting sleepy later as
8317.02 opposed to when we
want to be alert,
8318.79 its ability to enhance
focus, alertness, and mood.
8322.07 And if taken after trying to
learn something and remember
8324.82 it, to enhance
memory, especially.
8327.82 And its ability to increase
VO2 max, increased strength.
8331.222 We didn't even talk
today about it,
8332.68 but I'll just briefly
mention that caffeine
8335.559 ingested in the sorts of
doses we talked about earlier.
8337.969 Because its effects on
the neuromuscular system
8340.27 and the calcium system
associated with neuromuscular
8344.379 exertion and fatigue can
increase peak power output
8347.83 and muscle contractability.
8350.139 It's enhancing
performance there as well.
8352.18 And, of course, caffeine
does a number of other things
8354.91 just generally related to
overall and basal level of mood
8358.18 and alertness, not
the least of which are
8360.01 these increases in dopamine.
8361.969 So caffeine is really
an incredible molecule.
8364.629 It's affecting all these
various neurotransmitter
8366.94 systems but not haphazardly.
8368.95 It's increasing dopamine and
acetylcholine in the forebrain
8372.712 to increase attention.
8373.629 It's reducing fatigue.
8374.74 It's improving mental
and physical performance
8376.959 for some obvious and some
not so obvious reasons.
8379.34 And what I think is among the
more miraculous and powerful
8382.54 effects of caffeine, it is
a potent, potent, potent
8385.87 reinforcer of things, foods,
people, and experiences.
8391.51 And it's one that you can
leverage in any direction
8394.03 that you like once
you understand
8396.13 the way that caffeine exerts
those reinforcing properties.
8399.4 So today, I've really tried
to cover as much as I could
8402.4 about the mechanisms of caffeine
action in the brain and body,
8405.28 as well as tools and
schedules and dosages
8408.28 in which you can leverage
caffeine in order
8410.71 to meet your
physical performance,
8412.69 mental performance, and
frankly mental health,
8415.21 and overall health goals.
