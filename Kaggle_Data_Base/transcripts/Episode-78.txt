0.36 - [Andrew Huberman] Welcome
to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.3 where we discuss science
3.71 and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.2 - I'm Andrew Huberman.
10.26 And I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
12.98 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.21 Today, we are going to
talk all about healthy
17.55 and disordered eating.
19.28 And indeed, we are going to talk
20.52 about clinical eating disorders,
22.53 such as anorexia, bulimia,
and binge eating disorder,
27.15 as well as some other
related eating disorders.
30.31 However, before we get into this material,
32.41 I want to emphasize that
today's discussion will include
36.09 what it is to have a healthy
relationship with food.
39.38 We're going to talk about metabolism.
41.61 We're going to talk about
how eating frequency
44.43 and what one eats influences
things like appetite
48.7 and satiety, as well as whether
or not we have a healthy,
52.41 psychological relationship
to food and our body weight
56.43 and so-called body composition,
the ratio of muscle to fat,
60.44 to bone, et cetera.
62.65 So, as we march into this conversation,
65.08 I'd like to share with
you some interesting
66.682 and what I believe are
important findings in the realm
69.84 of nutrition and human behavior.
73.17 I know these days,
74.4 many people are excited about or curious
76.94 about so-called intermittent fasting,
79.73 intermittent fasting
is as the name implies,
82.76 simply restricting one's feeding behavior,
85.97 eating to a particular
phase of the 24 hour
89.39 or so-called circadian cycle.
92.25 Other forms of intermittent
fasting involve not eating
95.26 for extended periods of
time for an entire days,
98.33 or some people will extend to two days
100.21 or three days typically.
101.657 And hopefully they will drink
water during those times,
105.62 sometimes referred to as water fasting,
108.34 which means that they
are ingesting fluids.
111.23 And hopefully they are ingesting
electrolytes such as salt,
113.83 potassium and magnesium as well,
116.04 because well one can
survive for some period
119.79 of time without ingesting calories,
122.77 it is extremely important
to continue to ingest plenty
125.88 of fluids and electrolytes.
128.04 And the reason for that is
that the neurons of your brain
130.94 and body that control your
movements, your thoughts,
133.47 clarity of thinking in general, et cetera,
136.97 is critically dependent on the
presence of adequate levels
140.42 of sodium, potassium and
magnesium, the electrolytes.
143.79 And that's because neurons can
only be electrically active
146.7 by way of movement of particular ions,
149.5 which include things like
sodium potassium and magnesium.
152.37 So, without those,
153.6 you can't think, you can't
function and it actually
156.3 can be quite dangerous.
157.64 So, why all the excitement
about intermittent fasting?
160.9 Well, a lot of the excitement
relates to work that was done
164.17 by a former colleague of mine,
165.73 down at the Salk Institute
for Biological Studies
167.95 in San Diego, named Satchin Panda,
170.52 Satchin's lab identified
some very important
173.761 and impactful health
benefits of restricting
177.11 one's feeding window to particular
within the 24 hour cycle,
181.33 or even to having extended
fasts that go for a day
182.525 or two days, or maybe even three days.
188.04 What they saw was an improvement
190.08 in liver enzymes and improvement
in insulin sensitivity,
191.999 which is something that is good.
196.46 It means that you can utilize the calories
199.16 and the blood sugar
that you happen to have,
202.15 being insulin insensitive is not good,
205.01 and is actually a form of diabetes.
208.16 What Satchin's lab and
subsequently other labs showed,
212.08 was that restricting one's
feeding window to anywhere
214.64 from four to eight or even 12 hours
217.9 during each 24 hour cycle
was beneficial in mice.
221.48 And some studies in humans have also shown
223.71 that it can be beneficial for
various health parameters.
227.23 However, the excitement about
intermittent fasting seems
231.49 to be related to the foundational
truth about metabolism
236.902 and weight loss and weight
maintenance and weight gain,
240.41 which is that regardless of
whether or not you intermittent
244.07 fast or whether or not you
eat small meals all day long,
246.92 or you eat one meal in the
evening and snack up until then,
250.71 it really doesn't matter in
the sense that the calories
255.76 that you ingest from whatever source,
258.58 are going to be filtered through
the calories that you burn,
264.01 by way of exercise, basal metabolic rate,
266.46 which is just the calories
that you happen to burn,
268.78 just being alive and
thinking and breathing
271.08 and your heart beating, et cetera.
272.75 And the reason why many people
will prefer intermittent
276.24 fasting to other forms of let's
just call it what it is diet
280.28 or nutritional framework is
that many people find it easier
285.05 to not eat, then to
limit their portion size.
289.06 And here I'm not talking
necessarily about eating disorders.
291.94 I'm talking about the general population.
293.93 So, I think that's one reason
why there's so much excitement
297.574 about intermittent fasting.
298.49 Now, within the context
of intermittent fasting
301.65 on a circadian timescale,
once every 24 hours,
304.9 you generally find two
categories of people,
308.038 people who prefer to
not eat in the morning,
310.99 either because they are
not hungry in the morning,
313.07 or because they find it
relatively straightforward
315.81 to just drink things like
coffee or water, et cetera,
320.13 and push their feeding window
out to noon or 2:00 P.M.
324.14 or 3:00 P.M. and then they'll eat between,
325.74 say 1:00 P.M. and 8:00 P.M. or 9:00 P.M..
328.85 It depends on the individual.
331.24 Other groups of people find
that they are very hungry
333.54 when they wake up in the morning,
334.86 they don't feel well if
they don't eat breakfast.
337.12 And so they prefer to
eat early in the day,
339.42 but then they limit their
feeding window such that they cut
341.7 off their food intake or
stop ingesting any calories
344.65 of any kind, somewhere around 5:00 P.M.
347.43 or 6:00 P.M., et cetera.
349.3 So, the duration of the feeding window
351.05 has not been broken down
into the kind of nuanced type
354.83 of information that one would really want.
357.0 At least not in human studies saying,
358.61 well, a six hour feeding window
360.03 or an eight hour feeding window is ideal.
362.23 It really is going to
vary based on lifestyle
364.37 and circumstances, for instance,
365.77 some families really want
367.76 to eat dinner together every night.
369.33 So, do you want to be
the person that's sitting
371.21 there watching everybody eat?
372.44 Because you're fasting
from 5:00 P.M. onwards?
375.45 I don't know.
376.283 That's an individual difference.
377.69 What you can start to identify, however,
379.62 is that people tend to fall
into either one category.
381.98 The other people who prefer
to skip eating in the morning
384.52 or people that prefer to,
386.18 or managed to skip eating in the evening.
388.23 And there has been no evidence thus far,
391.28 that one is better or worse,
392.82 at least in terms of weight loss
394.37 or overall health parameters.
396.49 Now, you can imagine that some people
398.41 might eat breakfast and dinner.
399.76 And indeed I have several many colleagues
402.12 in fact who just choose to skip lunch,
403.84 because they're busy during the day,
404.84 they eat breakfast and dinner,
that doesn't afford the long,
408.27 fast associated with sleep.
411.09 What do I mean by that?
411.923 Well, if you went to sleep at 11:00 P.M.
413.81 and you wake up at 6:00 A.M.
415.87 by extending your fast until
1:00 P.M. in the afternoon,
419.26 you get quite a long period
of no ingesting any calories.
422.88 Whereas when you don't eat
during the middle of the day,
425.72 you are getting a fasting period.
427.22 That's probably anywhere
from four to seven hours,
430.39 but it's not linked to
the longer fasting period
432.992 of not eating while you
are asleep, because most,
436.22 all people and I want to emphasize most,
438.14 do not eat while they are asleep.
440.22 But we are going to talk
about any new disorder
442.41 that does exist, where people
actually eat in their sleep.
446.21 I know it sounds pretty
wild, but indeed it,
448.332 that eating disorder does exist.
451.68 And it has a very interesting
underlying mechanism.
455.17 So, why are we talking about this?
456.68 And in particular, why are
we talking about this during
459.87 an episode that includes a discussion
461.74 about eating disorders?
462.955 The reason is, nobody not the
government, no nutritionists,
468.7 no individual, no matter how knowledgeable
471.97 they are about food and
nutrition and food intake,
475.34 can define the best plan for
eating for any one individual.
481.21 I'm going to repeat that.
482.06 Nobody knows what truly healthy eating is.
485.5 We only know the measurements
we can take, liver enzymes,
488.87 blood lipid profiles, body
weight, athletic performance,
493.12 mental performance, whether
or not you're cranky all day,
496.14 whether or not you're feeling relaxed,
497.92 nobody knows how to define these.
499.43 And these have strong
cultural and familial
503.72 and socio-societal influence.
507.23 So, if you hang out with people
that intermittent fast all
509.96 day, that will seem normal.
511.47 If you spend time with
people that have never heard
513.49 of intermittent fasting,
514.67 intermittent fasting is
going to seem very abnormal.
517.82 Now we are going to talk
about eating disorders
519.8 that really fall into the category
521.39 of clinically diagnosable
eating disorders,
522.606 for which there's actually
serious health hazards
525.848 and even the serious risk of death,
527.852 we will get to that topic.
532.85 But for the time being,
533.683 I want to emphasize a new set of findings
536.7 that I think many people
will find interesting.
538.46 And at least we'll want
to consider in light
540.67 of their current nutritional
plan or pattern of eating,
544.35 whether or not you're
intermittent fasting or not.
546.88 And I want to cue up
an important framework
549.67 for the rest of the
conversation on healthy
551.61 and disordered eating,
553.07 which includes an understanding
of thinking, decision-making
559.02 and what we call homeostatic processes,
561.73 meaning regulation of things
that are going on in our brain
565.809 and body and reward mechanisms.
566.642 So, I'm going to return
to that in a moment,
568.14 but first I want to share
with you these new findings
570.68 that were just published in
the Journal Cell Reports,
573.621 a Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.
575.05 This was a study that was
performed both in mice
577.96 and it included a crossover
study with a human population.
582.44 The human population was women,
584.63 but it relates to a previous
study that was also carried
587.47 out in men.
588.65 I'm going to simplify this study.
589.85 We will provide a link to the
full study so you can explore
592.44 it in more detail.
593.36 And if you're really
excited about the results,
595.19 I would encourage you to
explore some of the references
598.16 within that paper as well.
601.44 What was the study?
602.8 The study looked at giving
mice or humans, two meals.
608.28 And explored whether or not
putting those meals early
611.25 in the day or late in the day,
614.41 had an impact on muscle hypertrophy,
617.62 muscle growth and overall
protein synthesis of muscle.
621.44 So, when we eat, the amino
acids from various foods
624.85 are broken down and synthesized
626.39 into different types of tissues.
627.64 They can be utilized for energy,
630.12 burned up for moving about
and thinking et cetera,
632.72 or it can be synthesize.
634.37 Those amino acids can be
synthesized into skeletal muscle.
638.01 The sorts of skeletal
muscles that allow you
639.49 to move your limbs.
640.772 This study explored how protein intake,
646.58 which included what are called
branch chain amino acids,
650.54 and amino acids, like leucine,
652.26 which are important for
muscle protein synthesis.
654.4 Explored whether or not emphasizing
657.92 or skewing the protein
intake toward early day
662.87 or late day was better in
terms of muscle hypertrophy.
666.92 And they also looked at
some parameters of strength,
668.97 like grip strength.
670.87 Now mice are nocturnal.
672.94 So, before you say wait,
mice are nocturnal,
674.82 how did they look during the day?
675.86 And it's completely,
676.693 it doesn't apply because it's in mice.
678.38 Of course they knew that.
680.29 And they looked during
the mice's active phase
684.33 of their circadian cycle,
which corresponds to our day.
686.88 And in humans, they looked
at whether or not eating
689.17 most of one's protein early in the day,
692.46 was better than if the protein intake
694.45 and the sprint chain amino acids
696.22 were placed later in the day.
698.2 And yes, they had the mice
do resistance training.
701.26 They did that by emphasizing
overload to one limb
705.89 of the mouse.
707.0 And that actually generates hypertrophy.
708.57 It's a form of resistance
training in mice.
710.98 So, they don't have them weight training.
712.52 They weren't doing curls
and dips and squats
715.03 and things of that sort.
716.0 They were moving their own body weight,
717.35 but they skewed that
distribution of body weight
719.7 by restricting a limb and
forcing them to use one limb
723.959 that did indeed grow in response to that.
725.57 And then in humans,
726.51 there was an exploration of grip strength.
728.47 And then with resistance
training that was also carried
731.29 out through a peripheral study.
734.282 Basically the takeaway from
this study was that mice
736.97 and humans can utilize amino
acids that are ingested early
742.12 in the day,
742.98 better than they can utilize
amino acids ingested later
746.6 in the day in particular
toward muscle hypertrophy
751.07 and growth or maintenance of muscle,
754.4 which for those of you
that aren't interested
756.22 in much muscle hypertrophy
that aren't trying
757.97 to grow your muscles.
759.06 I've talked before in the
episode on building strength
762.1 and hypertrophy, that maintaining muscle,
765.62 regardless of one's athletic prowess,
767.87 regardless of one's age
is extremely important
770.612 because loss of skeletal muscle
773.28 is one of the major causes of injury.
775.46 As we age.
776.293 It's one of the major causes,
777.126 believe it or not, of cognitive
and metabolic deficits
781.9 as we age.
782.733 So, maintaining muscle is important.
784.83 Building muscle might be
important to some of you,
787.401 but what they found was ingesting
protein early in the day.
790.35 And these amino acids early in the day,
792.233 led to more muscle hypertrophy
than if the majority
795.73 of amino acids and proteins
were ingested late in the day.
798.51 So, this translates to
intermittent fasting,
800.814 such that if you are interested
in muscle hypertrophy,
803.91 you might, and I want to emphasize,
805.1 might consider making sure
that you're getting sufficient
809.04 protein intake early in the day.
811.62 What sources of protein you use,
813.12 is going to be highly individual.
814.41 Some of you are meat eaters.
815.71 Some of you don't eat red meat.
817.14 Some of you eat chicken and fish and eggs.
818.678 Some of you don't, some of you are vegans.
820.95 It has been shown that the
amino acid leucine is vital
824.45 for the cell growth process,
826.03 including muscle growth,
because of its relationship
828.41 to the so-called mTOR pathway,
830.01 mammalian target of rapamycin.
832.32 We can talk about that more if
you like in a future episode,
836.39 this means that if you're
somebody who wants to maintain
839.13 or increase the amount of
muscle mass that you have,
843.49 ingesting a high protein
meal early in the day ought
845.94 to be beneficial for that.
847.94 Does it mean that you
should not eat protein
849.98 in the afternoon and evening?
852.0 No.
852.833 I think a lot of people might've
misinterpreted this study
855.66 and I don't want that to happen.
857.173 This is only pointing out the fact
859.93 that ingesting sufficient
quality amino acids,
863.33 including leucine, early in
the day can be beneficial
867.78 for maintenance and
growth of muscle tissue.
870.93 It does not say that you
should avoid protein later
874.05 in the day.
875.03 Now for you intermittent
fasters, this could be relevant.
878.54 I, for instance,
879.373 with somebody who for a very
long time skipped breakfast,
882.65 my first meal of the day would
be in the early afternoon,
886.05 mostly protein and salad,
in my case, animal protein.
888.89 'Cause that's in alignment with my values.
891.81 Then in the evening I would eat pasta,
894.6 vegetables, et cetera.
895.48 I might have some protein,
896.41 some small piece of fish or
chicken or something like that,
898.4 but I didn't really emphasize that.
900.7 On the basis of these results.
902.24 I am experimenting with.
903.6 I want to emphasize experimenting with,
905.2 I haven't completely
tossed out my old protocol,
908.78 but I'm experimenting with
eating proteins early in the day
912.74 and eating lunch.
914.06 And then dinner might be
light supper of some sort,
917.65 but not so much protein
later in the evening.
920.55 Again, if you want to eat six meals a day,
922.24 you want to eat round the clock.
923.3 I'm not going to stop you.
924.17 I'm not telling anybody what to do.
925.45 As I mentioned earlier,
926.283 nobody knows exactly how to
eat for one's particular goals.
929.37 But this study was really interesting,
930.83 because it really did
show that we can utilize
933.61 the proteins that are
ingested early in the day,
935.75 better than we can utilize
the proteins that are ingested
939.645 later in the day.
940.478 And of course there will be
factors that can shift that.
942.9 For instance, if you work out very hard
944.56 with resistance training later in the day,
946.43 resistance training is known
to increase protein synthesis.
949.295 So, it stands to reason
that ingesting amino acids
952.66 after that training would be beneficial.
954.292 However, in this study,
956.12 it did not seem to matter when
the resistance training fell
958.89 within the 24 hour schedule.
961.72 The morning ingestion
or early day ingestion
964.46 of amino acids seemed to be beneficial.
966.45 How early?
967.283 Between the hours of about 5:00 A.M.
970.845 and 10:00 A.M. for humans.
972.614 Now just a bit of mechanism
to explain why this happens.
975.386 So, why would it be that
ingesting protein early in the day
978.642 would lead to more synthesis of muscle
981.15 than ingesting protein later in the day?
983.277 And the reason it turns out is related
985.81 to the circadian clock mechanism
987.97 that is present in all cells,
including muscle cells.
990.584 So, muscles have fibers.
992.11 I think most people are aware of that,
993.42 that your muscles are not
just one big blob of tissue.
996.11 A lot of these little
fibers that contract.
998.128 Within those fibers, however,
there are cells with nuclei.
1001.092 Those nuclei contained DNA.
1006.76 DNA is transcribed into RNA.
1008.67 RNA is translated into proteins.
1012.85 The DNA of your cells,
1014.5 including these muscle cells
1015.84 are under strong circadian regulation.
1018.92 Each one has a pattern of gene
expression that is different
1022.6 at different times
during the 24 hour cycle,
1025.06 this is an unescapable reality
of all cells in your body,
1030.01 right from your hair
cells to your brain cells,
1032.18 to your retinal cells,
to your toe on both feet.
1036.25 These cells make a gene
called, BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L
1040.97 is a clock gene.
1042.21 And the expression of
this clock gene varies
1044.49 across the 24 hour cycle,
1046.43 and proteins that are downstream
1048.64 of this BMAL gene influence
protein synthesis.
1053.2 The circadian regulation
of this BMAL gene turns
1055.7 out to be vitally important
1056.683 for this protein synthesis mechanism.
1060.24 How do we know that?
1061.1 Well, in this particular study,
1062.67 because they had a mouse that lacked BMAL,
1067.19 the gene was knocked out,
they had bunch of these mice.
1070.86 They were able to explore
whether or not this early day
1073.4 feeding effect was present or absent
1076.82 in these mice that lack the gene BMAL.
1079.22 And indeed it was absent.
1080.58 In other words,
1081.6 the effect of increased protein
synthesis early in the day
1084.35 was eliminated in the
absence of the BMAL gene.
1088.29 So, what this means is that
when you wake up in the morning,
1090.79 assuming you're following
a standard schedule
1092.82 of being asleep at night
and awake during the day,
1095.63 your muscle cells are primed
to incorporate amino acids
1099.08 and synthesize muscle,
1100.67 regardless of whether or
not you weight trained
1102.42 the night before 8:00 P.M.,
1104.11 or you don't weight train at all,
1105.3 or you weight train afterwards or before.
1108.65 I said five to 10:00 P.M.
is the sort of critical
1111.32 window for this increased
protein synthesis.
1113.76 All this means is that if you
are interested in maintaining
1116.229 or enhancing muscle tissue volume,
1120.13 that you might want to
consider eating quality,
1123.84 protein and amino acids early in the day,
1127.33 you could train first.
1128.22 You could train after,
you can not train at all.
1131.14 That's entirely different discussion.
1134.21 What is quality protein,
1135.77 well quality protein is
going to be a protein
1137.69 that includes most of the
essential amino acids.
1140.45 And in particular leucine.
1142.76 Now, there's a lot of debate as to whether
1144.77 or not you can get all
the essential amino acids
1147.21 from a purely plant based diet
1148.67 or whether or not you need
1149.503 to ingest animal-based foods or not.
1152.41 The term quality protein
1154.33 has no strict scientific definition.
1156.345 Some people define quality
protein as a protein
1160.31 that has a high essential
amino acid to caloric ratio.
1164.89 Now, what that means is,
a small piece of chicken
1168.05 or steak or eggs for instance,
1169.97 will have many essential amino acids
1172.7 with a low caloric content
relative to say beans
1178.03 or plant-based food that can also get
1180.5 you essential amino acids,
1181.81 but it requires more calories to access
1184.48 those essential amino acids.
1187.12 Now that's that has many
exceptions and nuances.
1190.48 And I for one, and perfectly
respectful of the folks
1193.34 that just want to ingest
plant-based foods in order to get
1196.67 their high quality protein.
1197.92 I think that actually can be done.
1199.85 One has to be careful and
thoughtful in their choices
1202.61 about how to do that.
1203.66 So, this really isn't about animal based
1205.7 versus non-animal based foods.
1207.46 This is about getting quality
amino acids early in the day
1211.28 from whatever foods are in
alignment with your particular
1214.9 values in your particular eating plan.
1216.62 So, that's a lot of information,
1218.64 but the key takeaways are
every cell in your muscles
1221.95 has a clock gene.
1223.36 The clock genes vary such
that protein synthesis
1226.905 is greater early in the day
than it is later in the day,
1230.46 such that in both mice and in humans,
1233.37 ingestion of quality proteins
early in the day will be more
1238.13 so incorporated into muscle.
1239.7 Than the proteins that are
ingested late in the day.
1242.33 And of course there are the
caveats of if you're training
1246.19 hard late in the day,
1247.68 if you're adjusting your hormone status
1249.58 through whatever mechanism et cetera,
1251.605 protein synthesis can also
be high later in the day.
1254.96 But for most people it's
going to taper off due
1256.84 to this circadian BMAL
gene related mechanism.
1260.51 Again, we will provide a link to the study
1262.82 and the other key takeaways
were that nobody knows.
1266.17 Nobody can tell you what
healthy feeding windows are,
1269.27 what the best feeding windows are.
1270.76 There's absolutely no
information in that context,
1273.26 you talk to 10 nutritionists
or academics or trainers
1278.67 or individuals about
what healthy eating is,
1280.65 and you are going to get
vastly different answers.
1282.94 And that's one of the
reasons why I believe
1284.64 that the internet in
particular social media,
1288.09 are so filled with contradictory opinions,
1290.83 but the calories in versus
calories burned formula,
1295.65 is that more or less holy
foundation of all things
1299.52 about nutrition, eating and weight.
1302.245 And as we transition
today into the discussion
1303.58 about eating disorders,
1304.75 I'd like you to keep this in
mind because for the treatment
1308.6 of eating disorders,
1309.64 it doesn't matter what psychological
1312.222 or early trauma based effects
led to the eating disorder.
1316.61 If the person isn't adjusting
their feeding behavior
1319.56 in a way that is going to
ameliorate the symptoms
1322.07 of that disorder, which
is ultimately the goal.
1324.91 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
1327.44 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
1330.36 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
1332.54 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
1335.21 and science related tools
to the general public.
1338.14 In keeping with that theme,
1339.23 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
1342.2 Our first sponsor is Belcampo,
1344.82 Belcampo is a regenerative
farm in Northern California
1347.49 that raises organic grass fed
1349.26 and finished certified humane meats.
1352.5 I don't eat a lot of meat, but
I eat meat about once a day.
1353.547 That means a small piece of
steak or chicken, et cetera,
1358.761 and usually a salad.
1360.95 I usually do that for
breakfast or for lunch.
1362.828 And then in the evening
I tend to follow a more
1366.31 or less vegetarian diet.
1367.42 I tend to eat pastas and
vegetables and things of that sort.
1372.02 Well I don't eat a lot of meat.
1373.14 It's important that the meat
that I eat be a very high
1376.158 quality and that I am certain
that the animals were raised
1378.74 and treated humanely up
until the point of slaughter.
1382.1 Belcampo's animals, graze on open pastures
1384.17 and seasonal grasses, their
entire lives resulting
1386.65 in meat that's higher in
nutrients and healthy fats.
1389.742 It also results in healthy happy cows.
1392.26 Often talk about how important
omega-3 fatty acids are.
1396.06 They've been shown to be
important for regulating mood,
1398.84 for the microbiome,
1400.24 for restricting inflammation in the brain
1401.94 and elsewhere in the body.
1403.37 Belcampo's meats are known
to be high in omega threes.
1406.16 And given that the meat is
grass fed and grass finished,
1409.37 that combines all the
features of the nutrition
1412.77 and the animal wellbeing
that I want to see
1415.59 for any meat that I ingest.
1417.97 If you'd like to try Belcampo,
first-time customers can get
1420.39 20% off by going to belcampo.com/huberman
1424.14 and using the code huberman@checkout,

1428.891 Your first order.
1430.63 Today's podcast is also
brought to us by Headspace.
1433.67 Headspace is a meditation app.
1435.04 That's backed by 25 published studies
1437.35 and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.
1441.35 I've been meditating for a very long time.
1444.691 Although I admit I meditate on and off,
1445.97 meaning I'll go a few weeks or
months meditating regularly.
1449.04 And then I tend to stop.
1451.01 A few years ago, I got into
a regular meditation practice
1453.97 because I started using
Headspace meditation app.
1457.32 The thing I really like
about their meditation app
1459.14 is it has meditations
of different durations.
1461.36 So, sometimes I'll just
meditate for three minutes
1463.51 or five minutes,
1464.343 or ideally I'm doing two
20 minute sessions per day,
1467.08 but I confess I don't always manage that,
1469.33 but they have a ton of
different meditations
1471.25 on the Headspace app that allow you
1473.22 to tailor your meditation practice
1475.09 to your particular schedule.
1477.1 And there are now a plethora
of studies showing the benefits
1480.18 of a regular meditation practice.
1482.53 If you want to try Headspace,
1483.67 you can go to headspace.com/special offer.
1486.92 And if you do that,
1487.85 you'll get a free one month
trial with Headspace's full
1490.66 library of meditations.
1491.71 You get them all.
1492.543 That's the best deal offer
by Headspace right now.
1494.7 So, again, if you're interested,
1495.69 go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
1499.1 Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.
1503.142 Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral probiotic drink,
1505.18 and it's one that I've
been drinking since 2012.
1508.48 The reason I started drinking
Athletic Greens and the reason
1512.006 I still take Athletic Greens
is that it really helps me
1514.508 cover all of my nutritional
basis with respect to vitamins
1516.03 and minerals and probiotics.
1517.359 And we now know that a
healthy gut microbiome
1521.45 is supported by probiotics.
1523.17 And for me,
1524.55 Athletic Greens is the best
way to get those probiotics.
1527.21 I also ingest some fermented foods,
1528.81 but by ingesting Athletic Greens,
1530.49 I'm certain to get all the things I need.
1532.79 And also, I just feel
better when I drink it.
1535.35 I genuinely feel like I have more energy
1537.17 and I just feel better.
1538.47 And I happen to really
like the way it tastes.
1540.32 I mix mine with some water
and some lemon juice.
1542.22 And in doing that, I'm certain
to get all my nutritional
1544.85 basis covered and the probiotics support
1547.21 a healthy gut microbiome,
1548.53 which is important for mood,
1550.17 regulating inflammation and so on.
1552.91 If you want to try Athletic Greens,
1554.29 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
1557.2 And if you do that, you
can claim a special offer.
1559.69 They'll give you five free travel packs.
1561.22 In addition to your Athletic Greens order,
1563.01 those travel packs make it really easy
1564.63 to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road,
1567.07 in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
1568.62 And they will give you a year supply
1570.16 of vitamin D3, K2,
1571.92 vitamin D3 and K2 have
been shown to be important
1574.67 for blood lipid profiles for
metabolism and a whole bunch
1579.18 of other metabolic and neural processes.
1582.42 So, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
1585.07 to get the Athletic Greens,
1586.01 the five free travel
packs and the year supply
1587.85 of D3 and K2.
1589.67 So, let's talk about eating disorders.
1592.755 And as we do that, I
want to emphasize again,
1594.12 that nobody can really define
what healthy eating is,
1597.41 with a single protocol.
1598.66 However, there is some general agreement
1601.554 about what unhealthy and
disordered eating is.
1604.37 There are clear criteria
in the psychiatric
1606.82 and psychological communities
to define things like anorexia
1611.42 bulimia, binge eating disorder,
1613.1 all of which we will talk about,
1614.83 but as we have that discussion,
1616.04 I want to emphasize that self-diagnosis
1619.58 can be both a terrific, but
also a very precarious thing.
1623.95 We talked about this a
little bit in the episode
1625.7 about depression, there's always
a temptation as one learns
1629.59 about the symptomology
of a given disorder.
1631.86 It doesn't really matter
what the disorder is,
1634.19 to ask the question.
1635.023 Well, do I have that?
1636.26 Does so-and-so that I know have that, ah,
1638.006 I see this sort of behavior
or that pattern of thinking.
1640.724 In that individual, it's
tempting to diagnose them
1644.687 and or ourselves as either having or not
1647.18 having a particular disorder.
1648.49 However, diagnoses really need
to be carried out by people
1653.35 who are trained in that particular field,
1656.38 and that have deep
expertise in recognizing
1658.62 the symptomology, including some
1660.46 of the more subtle symptomology
of eating disorders.
1663.36 So, if any of the symptoms
resonate with you,
1667.72 by way of you thinking
1669.35 that you have this particular
disorder or someone that,
1671.18 you know, has this disorder,
I would take that seriously,
1675.0 but I would take that information
1676.76 to a qualified healthcare
professional that could diagnose
1680.73 or rule out any of these
possible disorders.
1683.43 I say that not to protect us,
1684.843 but to protect you, because
information is valuable.
1688.38 And I do believe that
knowledge of knowledge
1690.08 can be very valuable
in navigating any topic
1692.84 and improving our thoughts and
behaviors around that topic.
1695.324 But one doesn't want to, or I should say,
1698.84 one, shouldn't start to
self-diagnose simply on the basis
1702.07 of information without running
that through the filter
1704.97 of a qualified professional.
1706.75 So, what is an eating disorder?
1708.99 Well, we have to take a step back,
1711.243 and confess to the fact that
every society, every culture,
1715.69 every family, and every individual
1717.7 has a different relationship to food,
1720.35 eating disorders, however,
have particular criteria
1723.78 that allow us to define them and to think
1726.75 about different modes of treatment.
1729.22 As it relates to the particular
symptoms and particular,
1733.38 the psychological and biological symptoms
1735.65 of those disorders.
1736.483 Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended.
1738.329 What are the major eating disorders?
1742.24 Anorexia nervosa, most commonly
referred to as anorexia
1746.66 is perhaps the most prevalent
and the most dangerous
1751.41 of all eating disorders.
1753.13 In fact, anorexia is the most
dangerous psychiatric disorder
1757.31 of all, even more than depression.
1761.15 The probability of death
for untreated anorexia
1764.65 is very high, and sadly the prevalence
1767.97 of anorexia is very high.
1769.93 So, what is anorexia
and how prevalent is it?
1774.877 Anorexia, if you look
it up online or you talk
1776.14 to a qualified professional,
is essentially a failure
1778.91 to eat enough, to
maintain a healthy weight.
1782.32 You can see all sorts of very
troubling symptoms of somebody
1786.03 who's been anorexic for
some period of time,
1789.51 a general loss of muscle mass
because they're ingesting
1793.54 fewer calories than they burn.
1795.58 Muscle is very metabolically active.
1797.47 They tend to lose a lot of muscle mass.
1799.89 They will have a low heart rate.
1802.06 This is the body and brain's
attempt to lower energy output.
1806.67 They will have low blood pressure.
1808.29 They'll sometimes have
symptoms like fainting.
1810.95 They will have sometimes
even hair growth on the face,
1815.22 something called lanugo,
1816.85 which is essentially the body's attempt
1819.01 to insulate the body because
of loss of body heat.
1822.56 When you're that thin.
1825.787 Loss of bone density,
1826.9 osteoporosis, loss of
periods in girls and women,
1831.88 and all sorts of disrupted
gut and immune functions.
1837.41 So, there are just tons
of terrible symptoms
1840.04 of anorexia that really
placed the anorexic
1842.73 into a very risky state,
which is why mortality
1847.81 from anorexia gone
untreated is extremely high.
1851.82 Now, one of the
misconceptions about anorexia,
1855.7 is that it stems from an
overemphasis on perfectionism,
1860.09 or that because of all
the images in social media
1864.31 and in advertising of
extremely thin and fit
1867.75 or muscular people that
individuals are looking
1870.76 at themselves and comparing
themselves to those images
1874.1 and thinking that they don't match up
1875.63 and developing anorexia,
1876.838 that turns out to not be the case.
1881.16 If you look at the prevalence
or the rates of anorexia,
1884.92 in the last 10 years or 20 years,
1887.27 and you compare that to when
anorexia was first identified,
1890.75 which was in the 1600s,
and perhaps even earlier,
1894.14 what you find is that rates
of anorexia are not going up.
1898.55 So, this idea that the images
that we're being bombarded
1901.24 with are causing anorexia
doesn't seem to be true.
1905.19 Now, that is not to say that the images
1907.17 that we in particular young
people are being bombarded
1910.569 with are healthy for the
psychological state of mind.
1912.97 But classically define anorexia
has existed at essentially
1917.28 the same prevalence for the last 100, 200,
1922.17 300 and 400 years,
1923.68 which is incredible and really
speaks to the likelihood
1926.6 that there's a strong
biological contribution
1929.46 to what we call anorexia nervosa.
1932.12 Anorexia nervosa is extremely common.
1934.86 It's anywhere from one to 2% of women.
1939.79 And the typical onset is in
adolescence close to puberty,
1944.06 but it can show up later in life as well.
1946.96 In fact, the identification
and diagnosis of anorexia tends
1951.18 to be in the early '20s.
1953.47 But if you look back at the
history of those individuals,
1956.56 there were typically signs
of anorexia that back
1959.66 into their early teens.
1960.63 Or maybe even before that.
1963.715 Now, of course, men can
be anorexic as well,
1965.44 but anorexia nervosa does seem
to occur at 10 times the rate
1969.67 in women and young girls,
1971.61 than it does in men and young boys.
1975.1 So, while there does seem to be more
1977.21 of a prevalence of anorexia
in boys and young men,
1981.22 these days, that's probably
due to better diagnosis
1985.26 and detection than it is to some sort
1988.47 of societal shift related
to imagery, et cetera.
1992.07 Later, we will talk about body dysmorphia
1994.18 and some of the images
that are present in media
1997.54 and social media and how those
are impacting other forms
2000.4 of eating disorders.
2001.233 But when you look at anorexia nervosa,
2003.47 this failure to maintain weight,
2005.35 even to healthy levels
and often drops in weight
2008.32 that are very dangerous or even deadly,
2010.84 that has existed for a very long time,
2013.55 and seems to be somewhat
hardwired into the biology
2017.27 of individuals that suffer from it.
2018.6 Now, when I say hard wired,
2019.64 that doesn't mean that it
can't be treated or cured,
2022.13 and indeed it can.
2026.154 Bulimia which is defined as
binge eating or overeating.
2028.64 Let me explain what that is.
2029.64 Binge eating is consuming
vast amounts of calories
2032.16 in a short period of time.
2033.57 Overeating can be ingesting
more calories than one needs,
2038.19 but over an extended period of time,
2040.36 both can exist of course, but
bulimia is also very common.
2045.05 It's more common in young girls
2047.99 and in women that it is
in young boys and in men,
2051.26 but it is present in both sexes.
2054.93 Bulimia and rates of
bulimia might be increasing.
2058.95 That's sort of an interesting finding.
2061.42 It's not quite clear
whether or not it's existed
2064.32 in its same form for a long period of time
2066.28 or within other new forms that
are evolving or showing up,
2070.79 we're going to drill into bulimia
2072.437 and what it actually is
and what it represents.
2074.518 But one thing I want to be clear about,
2077.67 just as the perfectionist
mindset has been associated
2081.29 with anorexia, and it turns
out that's not the case.
2085.44 It can be, but it's not always
associated with anorexia.
2090.24 There was the idea that
bulimia is associated
2092.96 with early trauma in childhood,
in particular sexual trauma.
2096.55 And while that can be the case,
2098.72 there's no direct
correlation between the two.
2101.69 Now, obviously psychological
phenomena and trauma
2105.2 can have a profound impact on the way
2107.07 that the brain wires up and the way
2109.17 that people approach food
and other types of behaviors.
2112.48 But the sort of classic
idea was that all anorexics
2116.27 are perfectionists, they
want to perform well.
2118.78 It's all about control and autonomy.
2120.9 And bulimics are kind of
dysregulated and acting
2123.5 out against some early sexual trauma,
2124.562 those stereotypes of the
psychological framework
2129.9 of anorexics and
bulimics, doesn't hold up.
2133.22 When you look at the data, many,
2134.7 many meta analysis have been done.
2136.99 It just simply is not the case.
2138.78 And in both instances,
both anorexia and bulimia,
2142.2 there are clear biological underpinnings,
2144.72 to what's driving the
under-eating or the overeating.
2148.3 So, we're going to talk about
the biology of under eating
2151.31 and overeating and
appropriate levels of eating.
2154.73 And by doing that,
2155.77 we will start to identify
some of the mechanisms
2158.28 that serve as entry
points for the treatment
2161.63 of both anorexia and bulimia.
2165.287 And as some of you are probably aware,
2167.2 anorexia and bulimia can be comorbid,
2169.64 they can exist with one another.
2172.14 There are anorexics who
will binge and then purge
2176.18 in order to maintain that
unhealthily low weight.
2180.55 There are bulimics
2181.63 who fit the psychological
criteria of anorexia.
2184.601 And so there's a lot of overlap
2186.82 between those two categories.
2188.48 Now let's talk about the
categorization for a second and why
2191.43 the categorization has led to now a bunch
2194.06 of other eating disorders as defined
2196.17 by the psychiatric community.
2198.27 One of the classic symptoms of anorexia
2200.91 is a loss of menstrual
cycles, loss of periods.
2204.4 And the reason for that is when
the body is undernourished,
2207.62 the body fat stores,
send signals to the brain
2212.02 to inform that the body is undernourished,
2214.44 or they turn off the
signals that say, look,
2217.47 there are enough body fat cells out here
2218.88 to support healthy metabolism.
2221.16 And therefore let's shut down ovulation,
2224.073 literally signal sent
from the fat and muscle
2227.26 to the brain and the brain,
2229.07 the hypothalamus and pituitary
will send signals down
2232.37 to the ovaries,
2233.239 or they will turn off the
signals heading to the ovaries
2236.66 to deploy eggs,
2238.93 to maturation of eggs in
the follicle, et cetera.
2241.76 So, there are instances in
which people have anorexia
2246.77 or have bulimia,
2247.77 but are still maintaining
healthy menstrual cycles
2250.64 or at least menstrual cycles.
2251.99 And that has led to a whole
set of other categorizations
2256.9 of eating disorders, like
binge eating disorder,
2258.9 where there tends to
be a lot of overeating,
2261.07 but not the purging or
categorizations of anorexia,
2265.074 in which people are under feeding,
2267.1 but they are not losing their periods.
2269.01 And so these have a number of
different names and acronyms.
2271.81 Some of them include things like, EDNOS,
2274.48 EDNOS is eating disorder,
not otherwise specified.
2278.99 So, that's a sub categorization or OSFEDs.
2282.413 So, OSFEDs is or specified
feeding or eating disorder.
2286.45 So, right now,
2287.58 if you were to look
online or you're looking
2289.28 to the psychiatric and
psychological textbooks,
2292.24 what you would find is that
there's a huge constellation
2294.26 of eating disorders today.
2295.21 We're mainly going to talk about anorexia,
2297.63 bulimia, binge eating
disorder and body dysmorphia.
2301.42 You can even find eating
disorders like pica,
2304.0 where people actually ingest
things like dirt or rocks
2308.1 or metal because they
have a genuine appetite
2310.81 for those things.
2311.643 I certainly do not recommend sampling any
2314.63 of those non food items.
2316.12 As foods, is incredibly dangerous.
2318.62 People often poisoned themselves.
2320.52 They often can cause structural blockages
2324.09 some people have died from
those sorts of things.
2326.64 But nonetheless, there
are aspects of our brain
2330.01 and biology that when disrupted can lead
2331.97 to very bizarre types of eating behavior,
2334.7 sometimes pica is caused by
malnutrition, but not always.
2338.19 And so today we're going to focus
2339.92 on the most prevalent eating disorders,
2342.02 but we are going to build
up toward that understanding
2344.52 by looking at what healthy
metabolism and eating
2348.6 and satiety and hunger looks like.
2351.01 Because one, I realized that not everyone
2353.13 out there has an eating disorder.
2354.7 And two, I want people to
understand this relationship
2358.045 between how they think,
the decisions they take
2361.97 about what they eat
2363.09 and how the body and the
brain at subconscious levels
2366.65 are driving some of these
behaviors healthy or otherwise.
2370.35 Because I do think that
it can lead us to a better
2372.76 understanding of what healthy
eating is for most of us,
2376.08 and to increase compassion and hopefully
2379.04 even increased improvement in
treatment of eating disorders
2383.08 for those that are suffering from them.
2385.15 So, what is hunger and what is satiety?
2387.23 Satiety, of course being sated
2389.13 or feeling like we've had enough food.
2393.47 I want to remind people
of the basic mechanisms
2395.77 by which the brain and body communicate.
2397.68 This is vitally important,
not just for this discussion,
2400.07 but for any discussion, about
how we think, how we behave,
2404.17 how we feel, the body is
communicating two types
2407.68 of information to the
brain on a regular basis,
2410.72 but in particular around
feeding, and those two types
2411.792 of information are mechanical information,
2414.708 and chemical information.
2418.84 What do I mean by mechanical information?
2420.4 Well, if you take a deep breath, oh,
2423.15 and you hold your breath,
2424.24 what you'll find is that
you can hold your breath
2425.61 a lot longer than if
you exhale all your air
2428.04 and you hold your breath with lungs empty.
2429.79 And the reason is not because
when your lungs are full,
2432.91 you have enough oxygen
2434.4 and therefore you can hold your breath.
2435.81 It's because when your lungs are full,
2438.3 a particular class of
neurons called baroreceptors,
2441.23 send information to the brain and say,
2444.24 there's pressure in the lungs.
2445.4 And that means that there's
probably oxygen in here.
2447.7 And so the trigger to breathe
is actually suppressed,
2451.49 when your lungs are empty.
2452.76 Even if you have plenty
of oxygen in your system,
2455.23 those baroreceptors send a
different signal to the brain,
2457.61 which is there's no oxygen in
here and you should breathe.
2460.63 And so the impulse to
breathe comes earlier.
2462.47 Likewise, when your stomach is full,
2465.36 it sends signals to your
brain that are purely based
2467.75 on this mechanical fullness,
2469.74 has nothing to do with
nutrients, that says I'm full.
2474.06 And therefore don't be as hungry.
2476.73 Don't motivate to find or ingest food.
2479.5 Whereas when our gut is empty,
2481.3 even if we have plenty of nutrients
2483.28 or plenty of body fat stores,
2485.3 we tend to focus on food a bit more.
2487.9 So, volume and mechanical
influences have a profound effect
2491.68 on how we think.
2492.75 And what consider doing or not doing,
2495.65 likewise chemical effects.
2497.87 When we ingest food,
2499.22 our so-called blood sugar or
blood glucose levels go up.
2501.325 That information is signaled to the brain
2504.5 via neuronal pathways
and hormonal pathways.
2508.98 And in particular, there
are neurons within our gut,
2511.45 that signal to areas of our
brain stem that are involved
2513.96 in satiety in our sense of having enough
2516.18 that there's food in our system.
2518.44 So, that's chemical information.
2520.53 So, how our hunger and
feeding and satiety regulated
2525.63 by way of mechanical
and chemical signaling.
2528.79 You have, I have,
2529.82 we all have neurons in our
hypothalamus that trigger eating
2534.31 and neurons that trigger
cessation or stopping of eating.
2538.8 We have an accelerator on
eating and we have a break.
2540.423 And I covered all of this in
a lot of detail in the episode
2544.55 on feeding and metabolism and hunger.
2546.72 So, if you want a lot more
detail, see that episode,
2549.8 but right now,
2550.633 I'm just going to give you the top contour
2552.11 of how all that works.
2554.09 Your hypothalamus is an
area of your forebrain,
2556.14 which tells you it's in the front,
2557.97 but it's at the base of your
forebrain sits more or less
2560.18 above the roof of your mouth.
2561.44 The hypothalamus contains
lots of different kinds
2563.55 of neurons, including neurons
that stimulate sexual activity
2566.97 and desire, regulate your body temperature
2569.495 and control appetite and
ceasing of eating and appetite.
2576.67 There are two types of neurons
within a particular area
2579.26 of your hypothalamus
that are relevant here.
2581.23 There are the so-called
POMC neurons, okay?
2585.76 Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons
that tend to act as more
2590.83 of a break on appetite,
2593.62 by way of another hormone
2595.08 called melanocytes stimulating hormone.
2596.83 And not so incidentally
when you're getting
2599.23 a lot of sunlight and you're
viewing a lot of sunlight,
2601.3 that system is ramped up.
2603.21 This is why appetite is
lower in the summer months
2605.703 than it is in the winter months.
2607.48 This is true in animals.
2609.211 And this is true in humans.
2610.88 And you have a class of neurons
called the AgRP neurons.
2614.06 The AgRP neurons are the
ones that stimulate feeding,
2617.73 and they create a sort of
anxiety or excitement about food,
2621.68 can be positive anxiety, or
it can be negative anxiety.
2625.53 What do I mean by that?
2626.49 Well, if you ever seen kids
heading in to get ice cream,
2629.91 they're absolutely excited.
2631.23 You see people getting raised,
sit down and eat a big meal.
2634.44 They're excited to eat.
2635.53 Sometimes that's due to social factors,
2637.34 but they have an increase
in overall levels
2639.66 of autonomic arousal.
2640.569 And depending on the context,
2642.68 they can feel excited or anxious,
2644.31 but it is a ramping up of energy.
2646.37 These AgRP neurons are what caused that,
2649.53 in fact so much so that if you eliminate
2651.556 or kill these neurons, which has been done
2654.74 in experimental mouse
models in the laboratory,
2656.86 but also there are
humans that have lesions
2658.81 or neurotoxic effects
on these AgRP neurons.
2662.05 And what you find is that
they don't want to eat.
2665.008 They essentially become anorexic,
2666.5 meaning they don't want to ingest food.
2669.083 They have no appetite for food whatsoever.
2671.27 Now that's not exactly what anorexia is,
2673.44 but these AgRP neurons
are like an accelerator
2675.88 on wanting to eat.
2676.95 Whereas if you stimulate
these AgRP neurons
2679.64 or in humans that have
say a small tumor near
2682.58 these AgRP neurons,
they become hyperphagic.
2684.95 They will eat to the point of bursting,
2687.09 both animals and humans
that have elevated levels
2689.82 of these AgRP neurons are anxious.
2692.7 They want to eat,
2693.7 and they will ingest food to
the point where they override
2696.68 those mechanical and
chemical signals in the body.
2698.8 And I know it sounds
horrible, and it is horrible.
2701.21 They will eat until the
point that they burst.
2704.14 Now, there are signals
coming back from the body
2707.32 to inform the brain about presence
2709.21 of different levels of nutrients.
2711.13 And that generally comes
from three sources.
2713.47 First of all, is body fat.
2716.76 The more body fat we have,
2718.08 the more we secrete a hormone
called leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N,
2721.79 leptin from body fat,
2723.35 leptin goes to the brain
and suppresses appetite.
2726.741 This is a body to brain signaling
mechanism that says, look,
2730.78 I've had enough,
2732.63 not incidentally, leptin
signaling is disrupted
2736.53 in people that have bulimia and obesity
2739.72 and certain forms of
binge eating disorder.
2742.49 So, that system has disrupted
they have had enough signal
2746.05 or there's enough body fat
here such that you don't need
2748.69 to eat more right here,
I'm sort of in the voice
2751.3 of the body fat, trying to
talk to the brain, that signal,
2755.483 that dialogue is mixed up or messed up.
2756.316 In some cases it's absent entirely.
2758.38 So, the body fat is signaling to the brain
2760.82 about how much reserve you have.
2762.82 It's sort of like a
savings account for energy,
2764.807 'cause that's what body fat is.
2766.56 You've got lipids in there
and through lipolysis,
2768.193 that can be metabolized.
2769.5 If you're interested in that process,
2771.404 both how to increase it.
2773.41 And just generally how it works.
2775.29 You can see the episode on
the science of fat loss.
2777.685 The body fat is doing something
else really interesting
2780.5 that relates to anorexia,
2782.89 when they're sufficient levels of body fat
2784.83 and leptin circulating in the blood.
2787.27 And that leptin signal gets to the brain,
2789.97 the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland
2792.52 register that signal.
2794.5 And in a completely subconscious way,
2797.46 trigger the deployment of eggs
in females and the production
2803.15 of sperm in males.
2804.95 So, when body fat stores are very low,
2807.18 the reason why periods shut
off or sperm production
2810.22 is reduced or even shut off
is because there's not enough
2813.52 leptin getting to the
hypothalamus and to the pituitary.
2817.7 And they shut off the
signals, the hormones,
2820.5 things like
gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
2822.16 luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone,
2824.4 all these hormones.
2825.233 So, you don't have to remember the names
2826.12 of if you don't want to
that travel to the ovary
2829.26 or to the testes and
cause the ovary and testes
2831.86 to ovulate or to produce more sperm.
2835.6 So, the reason why anorexic
stopped having periods,
2839.33 while they stopped cycling,
2840.66 is because there isn't sufficient
leptin in the bloodstream.
2844.06 Now there have been attempts
to give leptin to anorexics
2848.54 because leptin has been
sequenced and the peptide
2851.55 has been synthesized.
2852.67 And so you can inject leptin into people.
2855.262 There are studies where they've done that,
2857.52 when that happens, it
does not tend to alleviate
2862.13 the anorexia, does not cause
2863.404 people to start eating again.
2864.84 And that actually makes sense
because leptin is also a way
2867.92 of shutting off the hunger signals saying,
2870.35 it's the body fats way of saying, hey,
2871.89 there's a lot of body fat here,
2872.9 or there is sufficient body fat.
2874.16 There doesn't even have
to be a lot, but it has,
2876.99 in some cases been shown
to rescue the menstrual,
2879.99 cycling in some anorexics, okay?
2882.47 So, body fat is signaling to the brain.
2884.81 The gut is signaling to the brain.
2886.34 There are neurons in your gut
that are primarily responding
2890.63 to meaning they fire electrical signals.
2892.41 When there are sufficient
fatty acids coming
2894.71 from fats you ingest, amino acids coming
2897.66 from proteins you ingest and sugars coming
2900.37 from carbohydrates and sugars.
2901.94 Things like fructose, glucose, et cetera.
2905.08 Those signals are being sent
from the fat and from the gut
2908.27 up to the brain.
2910.01 And therefore your body
has multiple signals
2914.38 of directing you toward
eating more or eating less.
2918.53 So, you've got two categories of neurons.
2920.13 One that acts as an accelerator,
the AgRP neuron saying,
2923.07 eat, eat, and get you excited to eat.
2926.78 And then you have a category of neurons.
2928.54 The POMC neurons that
are suppressing hunger.
2931.89 They're acting like a break,
and the body is informing
2935.0 the brain all the time about the status
2936.67 of the body and whether or
not it needs more food or not.
2939.83 So, you might ask why is it
that people who are overweight
2942.44 and have a lot of body fat,
2943.99 why they would continue to eat a lot,
2945.74 well past a certain
threshold of body fat that's
2948.26 when you start getting
2949.657 into these so-called metabolic disorders,
2950.92 where blood glucose
metabolism is disrupted,
2953.01 leptin signaling is disrupted
and there are all sorts
2956.05 of changes on both the
brain side and the body end
2959.76 of things, such that they're hungry,
2962.24 despite the fact that the body has plenty
2964.34 of energy on reserve.
2966.26 Okay, that I think is
sufficient to explain the basics
2970.88 of hunger and satiety are kind
of a biological mechanism.
2973.99 And the important thing again,
2974.91 to remember is that they're
mechanical and chemical signals
2977.71 that come from fullness
or absence of fullness
2980.05 that come in the presence
of glucose in the blood
2981.93 or the absence of glucose in the blood.
2983.96 When you haven't eaten for a long time,
2985.4 glucagon levels go up, for instance,
2987.59 GLP1 levels go up and those will drive you
2990.54 to seek out food and want food.
2993.041 And then there are the signals
that are coming from body fat
2994.67 and from neurons in the gut.
2996.04 So, there's a lot of convergence,
in a lot of pathways.
2998.8 I don't offer you all those
pathways to confuse you.
3001.12 I offer you those pathways
to clarify the extent
3005.38 to which something as simple
as eating or the decision
3009.23 to not eat is complicated.
3011.58 We've perhaps heard,
3013.02 or I've certainly heard
that, oh, you know,
3015.65 it takes about 20 minutes
for satiety to set in,
3018.49 so you should eat slowly that
you won't realize that you're
3019.995 full until about 20 minutes.
3022.52 That's actually not true.
3023.84 I don't know where that got started,
3024.96 but we should probably
all chew our food better
3026.91 and eat more slowly,
3028.28 be more mindful of what
we're eating, et cetera.
3030.82 So, in anticipation of this episode,
3034.24 I consulted extensively with a colleague
3036.31 of mine at Stanford,
3037.143 who sadly for us is going off
to University of Pennsylvania.
3040.64 So, our losses University
of Pennsylvania's win.
3044.23 His name is Dr. Casey Halpern.
3046.13 He's a MD, Medical
Doctor and Neurosurgeon,
3049.84 and a PhD who studies
binge-eating disorder
3052.3 and other types of eating
disorders and how they arise
3054.98 in the brain.
3055.84 And he's developed some
3057.106 really pioneering treatments for them.
3060.11 We'll talk more about his
work a little bit later
3061.86 in the episode, but we
got to the discussion
3064.47 of why a body that has
sufficient energy levels
3070.05 would desire to eat more at all.
3072.517 And this is not just the case
for binge eating disorder
3075.47 for bulimia, but why
that would be the case.
3077.78 You know, this is primitive biology
3079.56 that evolved over many tens.
3081.23 If not hundreds of thousands
of years, you see it in mice,
3083.27 you see it in humans,
3084.35 very similar types of
pathways and effects.
3087.38 How is it that human
beings who have plenty
3090.69 of fat on reserve and plenty of glycogen
3093.16 in their liver, et cetera.
3094.76 In other words, plenty of
energy, why they would be hungry,
3097.76 why they would eat at all.
3099.28 It seems like that just shouldn't happen.
3101.96 And he had a very important,
3104.45 and I think clear and intuitive way
3107.55 of framing up all this stuff around eating
3110.4 and motivated behaviors
and how they can go awry,
3113.26 not just in eating
disorders, but in all of us.
3116.91 Basically what he said was,
from an evolutionary standpoint,
3122.6 it makes sense that we should
eat as often as we can,
3126.68 as much as we can, and as fast as we can.
3130.63 Well, that sounds crazy.
3131.55 I've was told to eat not
too often, not too much,
3136.37 and to eat slowly and chew my food.
3138.82 But as Dr. Halpern pointed out,
3142.01 there are circuits in the
brain to reward eating
3144.23 often eating fast and
cramming as much food
3148.17 into you as possible.
3149.4 Because from a purely
evolutionary standpoint,
3153.39 food was scarce, and
seeking food was dangerous,
3156.49 whether or not it was from
animal sources or not.
3158.99 And it's always been competitive,
for those of you that grew
3162.6 up in families with a lot of siblings.
3164.13 This may resonate with you.
3165.49 I just one sibling,
3168.213 we were competitive about certain things,
3169.046 but typically not competitive about food,
3170.45 but I had friends that
had a lot of siblings.
3172.79 It was really interesting to
see how food was served up
3175.62 and how it was taken in those households.
3180.0 It was like food would hit
the table and it was just
3182.5 an absolute war for
portions and who got what
3186.75 and how much and who got
a slightly bigger piece
3189.01 of cake, et cetera,
3190.13 turned out to be a frequent
happening in these meals
3194.04 and that these birthday parties,
3196.529 whereas the only children
perhaps were used
3199.291 to having more food presented
to them without having
3200.86 to compete with other
members of the species.
3202.456 Every animal, including
humans has a hardwired circuit
3207.43 that we were born with that pays attention
3210.12 to how much food is available,
how much we are getting now
3213.53 and how much we are likely
to get in the future.
3216.32 And without going down the rabbit hole
3218.52 of arcuate nucleus
biology, in two sentences,
3223.88 you have a hypothalamic area
called the arcuate nucleus.
3227.0 It's a fascinating area.
3228.26 It's actually the area that houses,
3230.02 these PMOC neurons and
these other types of neurons
3232.48 that regulate hunger and satiety.
3234.673 And these neurons
3237.12 in the arcuate nucleus
start getting active.
3239.7 When we see food and think about food,
3242.27 they drive hunger, and they drive hunger
3245.95 in a way that's responsive
to what the food looks like,
3249.0 what it smells like,
3250.5 but also our prior history of
interactions with that food.
3254.15 And it takes into account social context,
3257.34 whether or not we are going
to get the whole pizza
3260.1 to ourselves or whether or not
there are going to be others
3263.25 that we are going to have to compete with.
3264.76 So, there are a lot of signals
that this arcuate nucleus
3265.876 in your brain are paying attention to.
3269.62 So, Dr. Halpern pointed
out that you actually
3272.11 have an accelerator that
increases your level of awareness
3276.19 and anxiety and sort
3277.57 of constricts your field of
view and all your senses.
3280.58 Anytime you interact
with food and is driving
3283.07 a primitive reflex to ingest
as much food as you can,
3286.22 as quickly as you can,
3288.15 and then move on from there,
3289.71 and presumably to do the same elsewhere.
3292.16 So, that changed the way that
I think about eating behavior
3296.387 and eating disorders.
3298.2 In fact, we could think about
eating disorders like bulimia
3301.57 as an unmasking of that mechanism
3303.8 without the so-called top-down control,
3305.57 without the mechanisms that we
use to regulate our behavior.
3309.35 And indeed bulimia and
binge-eating disorder
3312.45 are closely associated with impulsivity
3315.78 and with impulsive
behaviors of other kinds,
3318.83 something that we also will discuss more.
3321.82 What's the pathway?
3322.71 How does this work?
3323.543 What is Dr. Halpern and his
colleagues doing in order
3326.63 to try and treat things
like binge eating disorder?
3328.94 Well, you can frame all of behavior,
3334.06 good decision making
and bad decision-making.
3336.95 In a pretty simple box diagram model.
3339.82 And I realized that many of
you are listening to this,
3341.75 not watching this.
3342.76 There is no diagram to look at.
3344.14 I'll just explain it so
that you can conceptualize
3346.65 it in your mind.
3348.63 We have knowledge of what we
should do, in one box, okay?
3352.61 We should eat that.
3353.52 We shouldn't eat that.
3354.49 We should wait for dinner.
3355.39 We shouldn't wait for dinner.
3357.54 And then we have what we
actually do in another box, okay?
3362.05 Now this is true for all behaviors,
3363.58 we should say something or
we want to say something,
3366.12 but we don't, we shouldn't say
something, but we do anyway.
3367.73 That's the knowledge that
kind of looping in your head.
3372.765 I should do my homework.
3373.598 I should go for a run.
3374.45 I shouldn't do this right now.
3375.88 I shouldn't be on social media,
3377.54 all those kinds of shoulds and shouldn'ts
3379.32 that are circulating your head.
3380.69 That's one box.
3381.523 Then there's what you actually do.
3383.17 The behavior, whether or not
you suppress the behavior,
3385.58 you turn off your phone and
you go read a book or you go
3388.1 to sleep or whether or
not you stay up all night,
3390.53 or you stay up for another
hour, even five minutes.
3393.53 In between those two boxes
are two intervening forces.
3397.12 And those intervening forces
are critically important.
3399.97 Those intervening forces
are homeostatic processes,
3404.21 called by some processes, same thing,
3406.79 homeostatic processes,
that regulate the balance
3411.74 of different systems in
your body, hot and cold,
3414.23 awake or asleep, dopamine and
the desire to pursue things,
3418.79 serotonin and the desire
to just relax and chill.
3422.29 So, homeostatic processes
and reward systems.
3426.82 And as we now move into
discussion about anorexia,
3429.367 and bulimia specifically,
3431.66 what you'll see is that
anorexia and bulimia
3435.348 are not a breaking of the
mindset of what one should do
3440.22 or shouldn't do.
3441.96 It's a disruption of these
homeostatic and reward processes,
3446.31 such that decision-making
is completely disrupted.
3448.867 And in many cases is not available
3451.23 to the anorexic or bulimic.
3453.11 Now, I don't want to be abstract here.
3455.261 What I'm saying is that the
person who starves themselves
3458.82 to the point where they
might die and in some cases,
3461.08 sadly do die.
3462.283 They can know perfectly well
that their behavior is leading
3467.21 to bad outcomes and possibly even death.
3471.506 And yet they are not
able to intervene unless
3473.99 they get particular clinical help,
3476.8 because the homeostatic processes,
the signals from the body
3480.96 and brain that say, you need food.
3483.54 Those aren't registering in the same way
3485.92 that they are for other individuals.
3488.15 and for the bulimic or
the person that suffers
3490.44 from binge eating disorder.
3491.528 They don't necessarily
want to eat that food.
3494.93 They simply cannot help it.
3497.38 It's like a reflex for them,
3498.91 because the homeostatic processes
3502.09 and the reward processes
associated with food,
3504.74 are such that they can't intervene
3506.89 between the should do X, Y, or Z,
3510.05 or shouldn't do X, Y, or Z.
3511.34 And what their actual behavior is.
3513.1 Now, this isn't just a biological
mechanistic explanation
3517.19 for what could have been
summarized in two sentences.
3519.66 What this is,
3520.82 is a roadmap of where interventions
3523.75 can really make a difference.
3525.42 So, as we talk about different
drug based interventions
3528.39 or behavioral interventions
or social interventions,
3532.7 I'd like you to think
3533.87 about whether or not those
interventions are breaking into,
3538.36 or tapping into this box of the thinking,
3540.219 the sort of pattern of
thinking around food,
3543.66 whether or not it's the behavior,
3544.69 the actual ingestion or
the restriction of food,
3547.33 or whether or not it's tapping
into the homeostatic process,
3549.98 the balance of energy systems
and kind of getting enough,
3552.78 but not too much, or it's
tapping into the reward system.
3556.96 And just as a little teaser
of where we're headed,
3560.09 what you'll find based on the
data clinical data experiments
3564.01 done very carefully and very
well by excellent groups.
3567.06 What you'll find is the
anorexics have a sort
3570.24 of switch that's been flipped,
3572.78 such that their decision-making
3574.44 is actually pretty darn good.
3576.16 It might even be better
than yours in terms
3578.15 of evaluating food, nutritional content,
3581.01 but their habits are disrupted.
3583.24 So, they're not even
consciously aware of the fact
3585.69 that they're making terrible.
3587.01 And in some cases, very
dangerous food choices,
3589.43 and turns out that habits.
3592.83 And the way that we build and
break and rebuild new habits
3596.8 is one of the most effective
treatments for anorexia.
3599.56 So, now let's talk about anorexia,
3601.11 this failure to consume enough energy,
3602.315 such that the individuals
at risk of death,
3606.25 and if not death, then
severe metabolic disorders,
3610.03 lack of bone density, et cetera.
3612.64 As I mentioned earlier,
3613.64 anorexia and things that
almost certainly were,
3617.83 and are anorexia have
been described as early
3619.71 as the 1600s.
3620.88 And maybe even earlier,
3622.27 there are some records from the saints,
3624.32 from the 1400s of people
that refuse to ingest food.
3629.25 Another common myth is that
anorexia is only the sort
3634.3 of thing that you see in rich societies.
3637.43 These are spoiled
children with so much food
3640.02 that they decide they're
only going to focus
3641.65 on how slim they are,
3643.74 how they look in bathing
suits, et cetera, not true.
3646.682 A careful analysis through
medical epidemiology has shown
3651.08 that you find anorexia even in cultures
3653.62 and societies where food is scarce.
3656.3 So, that really speaks
to biological mechanism.
3658.75 Now it's hard to unveil in
societies where food is scarce,
3662.23 because a lot of people
are starving and hungry,
3664.843 but there are individuals that
choose still to avoid food
3669.88 and seem to have some sort of
reward mechanism that rewards
3673.29 them, where makes them feel
better if they don't eat,
3676.75 despite the fact that their body
3679.79 is severely depleted of nutrients.
3682.04 So, that's very interesting
and points again
3683.84 to some disruption in
some biological mechanism.
3686.59 Now, I want to make sure
that I'm emphasizing
3689.65 that I'm not in favor of people,
3692.55 in particular young children, adolescents,
3695.01 and teenagers being bombarded
3696.37 with unrealistic imagery about bodies.
3699.07 But the idea that that's the cause of,
3701.76 or is amplifying anorexia,
the data just don't seem
3705.21 to support that, anorexia
in its classic sense,
3709.78 requires that there be an endocrine,
3712.65 meaning a hormonal disruption,
3714.93 menstrual abnormalities,
lack of sperm production,
3717.53 or low testosterone in
males, in order to meet
3720.76 the classification for anorexia.
3723.55 But as I mentioned earlier,
3724.6 there are now nuanced and new
classifications of anorexia
3729.32 that even for individuals
that still menstruate
3731.78 or that maintain a sperm
production anorexia,
3735.34 can still be considered
3736.71 a clinically diagnosable disorder.
3739.27 Now, typically anorexia
starts in adolescence,
3742.63 right around puberty.
3743.64 Let's take a look at what puberty is.
3745.44 Puberty at a very broad
level is the most significant
3750.18 and dramatic developmental step.
3751.98 Anyone goes through in their lifespan.
3753.88 The body changes, the
brain changes, perceptions,
3756.08 change, one's own self
perception, changes.
3759.4 And most of those changes are
driven by changes in circuitry
3763.63 within the hypothalamus.
3765.12 So, neurons that are
controlling the production
3767.01 of the so-called sex steroid hormones,
3769.57 things like testosterone,
3770.54 estrogen, and related
hormones, prolactin, et cetera.
3773.43 Those are all changing
at very rapid rates.
3777.69 Anorexia tends to show up
around this time in a subset
3780.7 of individuals who on the
face of it seem to find food,
3785.04 aversive, now the purely
psychological theory
3787.82 of this is that they are
fighting for autonomy.
3790.55 They want control.
3791.85 Puberty is also a time in
which children and parents
3794.57 are in a tug of war over control.
3797.24 You were once a small child
being told when to go to bed
3800.49 sent to your room.
3801.43 Now you're a child that
can talk back and say,
3803.86 I don't want to, or I refuse to.
3806.21 And that happens a lot
in various households,
3809.25 as I'm sure you're familiar with.
3810.896 Adolescence and puberty
3813.3 is also when girls start
menstruating typically,
3817.5 or boys develop deeper voice,
3821.89 they start producing sperm, et cetera.
3824.47 So, there are a lot of bodily changes
3825.8 that also drive perceptual
changes and perceptual changes
3828.43 that drive bodily changes.
3829.97 And it is a dramatic
shift for a young girl
3833.71 or boy that doesn't nourish
themselves sufficiently.
3836.76 During that period,
3837.593 there are a number of
downstream negative effects.
3840.41 I'll list out some of them,
3841.61 these are just a subset of
the effects, hypogonadism.
3845.33 That's the lack of sperm production
3847.87 or healthy egg production.
3850.1 There is amenorrhea,
3852.39 which is the lack of
menstrual cycling, okay?
3855.16 So, a failure to have a menstrual cycle.
3857.71 Reduced insulin secretion,
insulin is this hormone
3860.13 that's released in order
to help shuttle glucose
3863.36 into various tissues
for energy utilization.
3865.66 That's down because energy
levels are down so much.
3868.33 One of the symptoms that's
a little more cryptic,
3870.39 and that has actually
interesting implications
3872.49 for sake of the cholesterol
hypothesis is that anorexics
3877.62 who ingest very little
food often have cosmically
3881.45 high levels of cholesterol, including LDL,
3884.01 low density, lipoprotein cholesterol.
3886.0 You say, well, how could that possibly be?
3887.48 We were all told and continue to be told
3889.94 from many sources that
ingestion of dietary cholesterol
3893.48 is what drives high levels
of bodily cholesterol.
3895.94 Cholesterol is manufactured
by the liver and in anorexics
3900.03 who consume very little food.
3902.058 They often have cosmically
high levels of cholesterol,
3906.14 which is one of the kind of wrinkles
3908.57 in the so-called dietary
cholesterol hypothesis
3911.58 that all of our cholesterol
that we see on a blood panel
3914.61 is due to what we eat.
3915.979 But the explanation for it
is that under conditions
3919.62 where there's not sufficient cholesterol
3921.26 to synthesize the sex steroid hormones,
3923.4 things like testosterone and estrogen,
3925.01 which are required in
both males and females,
3927.13 those are made from
cholesterol that the body,
3931.36 the liver will start
generating its own cholesterol
3933.84 will often overshoot the
mark to a dramatic degree.
3937.233 So, the blood lipid profiles and anorexics
3939.87 are often very unhealthy despite the fact
3942.21 that they're eating very little food.
3944.86 In addition, they tend
to have elevated levels
3947.04 of things like vasopressin,
3948.6 which are hormones that
regulate body temperature
3950.92 and salt and blood volume.
3954.16 They tend to have low blood pressure.
3955.42 They can pass out.
3956.4 I mentioned some of the
other symptoms earlier.
3959.93 In other words, there are a huge number
3961.76 of terrible things happening.
3963.13 Thyroid levels are down.
3964.52 Heart rates are down, if
I'm painting a very bleak
3967.5 picture here is indeed a bleak picture.
3970.25 So, we have to ask
ourselves what can be done
3973.3 for the anorexic, right?
3975.592 Let's say it's a failure
of the AgRP neurons
3979.31 to stimulate appetite and feeding.
3982.0 Let's say it's too much
anxiety around food.
3984.23 Let's say it's because of
the way that food restriction
3987.21 was used for reward in
the household, right?
3989.37 I'm making this up,
3990.203 but you can imagine a
hypothetical scenario
3991.84 where let's just say the mother
of a particular individual
3996.85 is very vocal about her avoidance of food.
3999.11 We've seen this before, right?
4000.3 You've probably seen
somebody who loves to cook
4002.33 and prepare food, but then sits down
4003.73 and doesn't seem to eat.
4005.352 And they always seem to in
air quotes have eaten earlier.
4009.002 I ate while I cooked, I
ate while I cooked, right?
4009.93 These people that you
never actually see eating,
4012.85 we all know people like
this, are they anorexic?
4014.7 Possibly, we don't know.
4017.05 A child observes that kind of behavior.
4018.96 Maybe that individual is
being always being told how
4021.4 beautiful they look or how
wonderful or fit they look,
4024.19 what incredible meals they produce.
4026.6 And you could imagine a purely
psychosocial set of events
4032.46 that could lead a child to be anorexic.
4034.96 That doesn't seem to be the case,
4036.92 at least not in terms of driving classic,
4039.62 anorexia, a really extreme
deprivation of oneself from food.
4045.23 However, there is a strong
genetic component for anorexia.
4048.81 So, you could imagine a mild
form of anorexia in a parent
4052.8 that is supported or
exacerbated by praise,
4057.73 so that the person feels
good from the praise
4059.83 they're getting, that they
want to be a low body weight
4063.58 for whatever reason,
4064.48 for aesthetic reasons or for
whatever reasons that happened
4067.35 to appeal to them.
4068.47 And the child has a genetic
predisposition, right?
4072.44 We never think about genes in
terms of controlling behavior,
4075.33 genes, bias, probabilities
for behavior, okay?
4079.65 So, you can have a gene for
depression of schizophrenia,
4081.78 but it's not deterministic,
in the same way
4084.29 that there are genes that
determine your eye color,
4086.83 or your skin color or
your hair color, okay?
4090.32 So, there's a genetic
predisposition there.
4093.06 And that genetic predisposition
could exist such that if one
4096.98 is rewarded enough times
for a particular behavior,
4100.38 that behavior can start to ratchet in
4104.06 to our neural circuitry,
4105.26 because behavior drives neural changes,
4107.13 so called neuroplasticity.
4108.42 And you could imagine that
that child could develop
4111.34 a full-blown case of anorexia.
4113.23 And this is why I raised at the
beginning that no one really
4116.25 knows how to define healthy eating.
4118.31 And so therefore we have to
rely on just identification
4122.55 of unhealthy behaviors,
4123.92 but what do we point people to in terms
4125.5 of what healthy replacement
behaviors would be.
4128.74 So, rather than just look
at anorexics and say,
4131.41 they're not eating enough.
4132.46 And there's this huge
array of terrible things
4134.71 that they're doing to their
body, and they need to eat more.
4137.27 We need to rescue them from themselves.
4139.72 Let's look under the hood.
4140.96 Let's look at, what's known
about the neural circuitry
4143.46 and the sorts of perceptions and behaviors
4145.79 of the neural circuitry is driving,
4147.79 in order to understand what
they are truly suffering from,
4151.79 at the level of cause ,not just symptoms,
4154.2 it's clear what they're
suffering from at the level
4155.91 of symptoms, symptoms are how we diagnose.
4158.479 I listed off a number of those things,
4161.76 but let's look under the
hood and try and identify
4164.65 where one could intervene in theory,
4168.66 in order to try and rescue the anorexic
4171.3 or help the anorexic rescue themselves.
4174.45 Because it turns out that
the answer or at least one
4178.18 of the answers of how to do
that is not intuitive at all.
4181.21 At least to me was very surprising.
4183.51 I would be remiss if I didn't
start with the obvious,
4186.12 which is, is there a chemical defect?
4190.02 Meaning is there some
disruption in one of the major
4193.54 chemical systems in the brain
that makes anorexics anorexic
4197.28 and therefore, can we
replace that chemical?
4199.534 Or can we reduce some chemical
4201.35 and essentially eliminate anorexia?
4204.14 And the answer is not
really sort of maybe no,
4208.79 here's why, there are a
lot of different chemicals
4211.21 in the brain and body,
4213.27 but there are a category of
chemicals that are particularly
4216.83 important that if you've
listened to this podcast before,
4219.33 even if you haven't are
going to come up again
4222.46 and again and again,
4223.45 and that is the category
of chemicals in the brain
4225.56 and body called the neuromodulators,
4227.93 neuromodulators are different
than neuro-transmitters
4230.55 in the sense that
neuromodulators modulator
4233.449 or change the activity of
brain areas in neural circuits,
4235.51 you can think of them as
microphones that are held
4238.81 between particular sets of
connections in the brain
4241.29 that make those connections in the brain,
4243.01 more likely to be active
relative to others, okay?
4246.87 They make them louder so to speak,
4249.92 there are many neuromodulators,
4251.21 but the ones that are important for sake
4252.65 of today's discussion
are the classic ones,
4255.39 dopamine, acetylcholine,
4256.69 or epinephrin and serotonin.
4259.02 Let's focus on serotonin.
4260.33 Serotonin is a neuromodulator
that tends to increase
4266.3 the activity of certain neural circuits,
4268.59 including within the hypothalamus,
4270.19 but also within the body that
trigger a sense of satiety,
4274.42 of having enough, enough
food, enough warmth,
4279.01 enough social connection,
4281.09 enough of any motivated goal
or drive or any type of thing
4287.12 or behavior that one would want more of,
4289.5 serotonin tends to make
those circuits quiet down.
4294.79 Now, there are many categories
of drugs that emphasize
4299.18 the serotonergic circuitry,
meaning they cause the release
4302.05 of, or the efficiency of
serotonin in the brain and body.
4305.35 Things like Prozac, Zoloft,
Paxil, things of that variety.
4310.41 Those drugs have been used
to some degree of success.
4314.26 Although not much to treat
things like anorexia nervosa.
4318.48 That should make sense,
because if these drugs increase
4321.82 serotonin, if their general
effect is to increase serotonin,
4326.249 it will be to lower anxiety.
4328.76 That sounds like a great thing.
4330.26 A lot of anorexics are
really anxious around food.
4333.32 We'll talk about why, lowering
anxiety you might think
4336.61 would lead to ingestion of more food,
4338.67 but that's not often what
happens, increasing serotonin,
4343.04 by way of some drug regimen will tend
4345.93 to make one less hungry,
because with heightened levels
4350.66 of serotonin in the blood and brain,
4353.4 there isn't the desire
to go seek out the things
4355.83 that will raise serotonin on their own.
4357.8 Now, some anorexics do well or benefit
4360.71 from these serotonergic drugs,
4363.48 these drugs that increase the
activity of these circuits
4365.82 that leads to satiety.
4366.847 But if you think about
the major goal of treating
4371.09 an anorexic it's to get them
4372.69 to have more hunger, more appetite.
4375.63 So, now I want to focus on some
of the work that's been done
4379.516 around the habits and
behaviors of anorexics,
4381.3 because those turned
4382.133 out to be ideal places for intervention.
4386.97 The work I'm about to describe was done
4389.54 by Dr. Joanna Steinglass and colleagues
4391.89 at Columbia University in New York.
4393.81 And there are other groups as well.
4395.24 Of course, they're
doing this type of work,
4396.91 but they did what I think
are really some beautiful
4401.379 experiments and some
beautiful explorations
4403.21 of potential treatments for anorexics.
4405.04 That seemed to have a quite high degree
4408.469 of effectiveness when they
are applied correctly.
4412.32 First of all, there's a
challenge in studying anorexia
4415.26 because in anorexia,
4416.33 what you're essentially
studying is the absence
4419.42 of a behavior.
4420.41 It's very hard to study
the absence of a behavior,
4423.32 as opposed to a behavior.
4425.51 So, they did some
experiments with anorexics,
4427.61 giving them a gallery of
pictures of different foods,
4431.67 and allowing those anorexia patients
4434.12 to arrange those foods,
4435.4 according to preference
about what they would select,
4439.04 about food, nutrient content
about caloric content.
4443.13 They essentially asked these
anorexics to evaluate food,
4447.14 and in doing so,
4447.973 they were able to identify
something that's very unique
4450.87 to anorexics at the level
of their perception of food.
4455.29 What they found is the anorexics,
4457.83 rather than being anxious
in the presence of food,
4460.4 and that anxiety driving
and avoidance of food.
4463.253 What they found is that
anorexics have a hyper acuity,
4467.05 a hyper awareness of the
fat content of foods,
4470.34 almost to the point of being
sort of fat content savant.
4473.89 Now they don't necessarily
know that they're doing this.
4476.84 They're not looking at an
avocado and thinking, okay,
4478.91 that's X number of grams of fat rather,
4480.702 or looking at an apple and
saying, okay, that has no fat.
4483.933 They start to do this
more or less reflexively.
4487.12 Now it's a well-known symptom of anorexia,
4489.9 especially young anorexics
that they have kind
4493.35 of an obsession with
food, caloric contents,
4496.14 macronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein
4499.04 and carbohydrate ratios.
4500.94 They know caloric numbers,
4502.269 but then they sort of
pass that information
4504.81 into a memory system in
their brain that allows
4507.97 their interactions with
food, to be very reflexive
4511.38 in a way that they are actively
avoiding high-fat content,
4516.03 foods, calorie rich foods,
4517.82 and defaulting towards
very low calorie foods.
4520.86 If they have to eat.
4523.03 Now, this might seem like
an almost trivial result
4526.467 on the face of it, you think, okay,
4527.828 they don't like to eat when they do eat.
4529.671 They eat low calorie, low fat foods, duh,
4530.84 but it's the way in which they
are doing this subconsciously
4535.01 that they learn this
information and then they pass
4537.07 it off to a reflexive habit.
4539.2 And that's very important
because what that means
4541.96 is that we need to look at
what processes in the brain,
4544.93 what brain areas,
4545.77 what chemicals drive
decision-making and knowledge.
4549.96 And we also need to look
at the areas of the brain
4552.34 that drive habit formation
and habit execution,
4557.4 because for any of you that have habits.
4559.447 And that means all of you,
4561.44 the hallmark feature of a
habit is that it's reflexive.
4564.13 You have a mosquito bite on
your leg, you scratch it.
4566.47 You didn't necessarily even think, oh,
4567.99 I'm going to scratch that.
4569.274 In fact, just to take a little
bit of a moment of respites
4573.12 and talk about habits in general,
4575.8 there's a beautiful
study that was done out
4577.62 of Caltech University,
4580.0 looking at the parking
lot of where people park
4584.241 in the morning, without
designated parking spots,
4585.81 and the trajectories that they
use to walk to their offices
4588.77 in the morning.
4589.603 So, they put cameras up
on the roof of Caltech,
4590.487 is the kind of thing that
the nerdy kids at Caltech do.
4593.31 I think at Caltech,
4594.39 if you call someone a nerdy
is I think it's a compliment.
4596.17 So, my apologies to the
non nerds at Caltech,
4598.42 I think there's one or two
of you and for the nerdy ones
4601.22 of you at Caltech, you're welcome.
4603.77 They videotaped the
behaviors of these faculty
4606.1 and students and staff.
4608.839 And what they found, is that
people follow trajectories
4611.04 from their car that are
remarkably stereotype.
4613.73 First of all, they tend to
park always in the same spot.
4616.77 If they can, they tend
to get out of their car.
4619.01 Of course, 'cause they're
on the driver's side
4620.24 or passenger side in the same place.
4622.07 They turn and pivot their
body at approximately
4624.85 the same rate every day.
4625.683 They close the door,
4626.97 they've put their bag on their shoulder
4628.53 or across their chest,
4629.57 or however it is that
they carry their briefcase
4632.118 or whatever it is.
4632.973 And they follow trajectories onto campus
4635.14 that are so stereotyped.
4636.77 That you'd wonder if you just trace line,
4638.61 after line after line.
4639.53 What you'd find is that every
day is almost exactly the same
4643.73 and you do this too.
4644.95 You don't realize it because
if you're being videotaped
4647.99 in this kind of behavior, it's
not being released to you,
4650.13 but your behaviors are so
stereotyped to the point
4653.2 where if you were to see them
laid out in front of you,
4655.44 in kind of diagrammatic
format of the lines
4658.1 and the trajectories that you
follow throughout the day,
4660.41 the lifting of your mug and how frequently
4662.55 you drink each hour,
4663.63 you would be amazed and
probably a little bit scared
4667.81 by how much of a robot we all are.
4670.553 Now that robotic aspect of
our neurocircuitry is vital,
4674.72 because it's what allows us
to think about other things
4677.0 and do other things, and
drive other behaviors.
4679.83 But the work of Dr. Steinglass
and colleagues showed
4683.08 that in the case of the anorexic,
4685.3 those habits are exactly
the place where things start
4688.71 to go awry.
4690.0 And that drive this very
dysfunctional under-eating behavior
4693.74 that sadly often leads to death
4696.15 or certainly bad medical outcomes.
4698.6 And it turns out that the
brain areas associated
4701.66 with habit formation and execution
4704.28 are the best point of intervention.
4706.65 So, what Dr. Steinglass
and colleagues did,
4708.92 is they took anorexics and they
of course had control groups
4713.02 and they put them in an FMRI scanner,
4716.21 which are these brain scanners
that allow you to evaluate
4719.07 which brain areas are active,
during particular tasks.
4722.43 And because when you're
in one of those scanners,
4724.28 you actually, you know,
4725.99 I've actually been in one of these things.
4727.22 You're biting down on a
bite bar and you're most
4730.03 of the time and most all of
these scanners you're immobile.
4732.56 So, you're looking at
things on a TV screen.
4734.15 Sometimes you can press
buttons to select choices
4737.0 and so forth, but you can't
really eat within those things.
4739.929 What they found was that
reward based decision-making,
4745.96 the drive to pursue a
particular food or the drive
4750.04 to perform a particular task,
4752.48 which is a lot of what
we do throughout our day,
4755.25 that was controlled by a brain area called
4756.79 the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
4759.21 Let me simplify a little bit of this,
4760.83 but I'm going to simplify it
by giving you a little detail,
4763.53 because it's the Huberman Lab Podcast.
4765.03 And I believe in mechanism,
4767.29 mechanism is the way that
you get true understanding
4769.71 and that you can then be
very quick and give overviews
4774.1 of things, but you need the mechanism.
4776.25 So, you have reflexes and
you have neural processes
4783.9 that include what are called duration path
4785.94 and outcome type processes,
4787.77 a duration path, outcome type process,
4789.91 we can shorten with DPO.
4792.13 DPO is for all types of
goal related behaviors.
4797.24 So, for instance,
4798.17 if you want to get a
particular grade on an exam,
4800.75 you want to learn something,
you want to complete a workout.
4802.59 You want to go to the grocery
store and pick some stuff up
4805.28 and then head home.
4806.49 You're going to think duration.
4808.29 How long do I have, okay,
4809.43 do I have 45 minutes to get to the store?
4811.18 How long does it take to
get to the store path?
4812.841 Which way am I going to drive there?
4814.5 Which way am I going to navigate
through the grocery store,
4817.05 outcome, was able to get
in and get the items I need
4819.47 and get home in time, okay?
4821.01 DPO, duration path outcome.
4822.65 It's a very conscious process.
4824.167 You tend to take into account
different criteria related
4827.47 to what's preventing
you from accomplishing
4830.56 what you want to do
4831.393 and what's helping you or assisting you.
4834.46 So, of course,
4835.293 as you get to the checkout
line in the grocery store,
4836.54 you're going to select the
shortest line for instance.
4838.18 So, that's all DPO stuff.
4839.41 It requires decision-making
and it's reward-based,
4842.8 you use these DPO type
processes in the short term
4846.57 to pick up groceries and pick
a line at the grocery store
4850.25 and decide which trajectory to take home.
4852.867 And you use them for navigating
long extended processes
4856.92 in life, trying to get a
degree or raise children
4859.11 or get through a particularly
challenging year, et cetera.
4863.7 So, duration path outcome,
4865.27 and that entire process
relies on your fore brain.
4869.431 This prefrontal cortex,
4871.55 the prefrontal cortex is what allows you
4873.87 to take information from memory,
4875.53 combine it with information
about what's happening
4878.27 in the present context, and
then to direct your behavior,
4881.99 your speech, et cetera,
toward particular outcomes.
4885.68 And if all that sounds
like a mouthful, it is,
4889.28 and it's very metabolically demanding,
4891.01 decision-making is
metabolically demanding.
4893.22 It takes effort, okay?
4896.8 Reflexes on the other hand,
4899.1 don't involve the prefrontal
cortex in the same way,
4901.56 habits and reflexes.
4902.629 Like once you know how to
walk, you get up and you walk,
4905.85 you don't have to think
about right foot, left foot,
4908.392 right foot, left foot.
4909.225 You just do it.
4910.058 That doesn't rely on prefrontal cortex.
4911.85 It's subconscious as
it's sometimes called,
4913.88 but basically you don't have
to use the parts of the brain
4916.89 that are involved in duration path
4918.44 and outcome type analysis.
4920.41 Okay, so, in this particular study,
4923.36 they examined brain activity in anorexics
4926.94 who are selecting different foods.
4929.94 And as I mentioned earlier,
4930.94 they have a hyper acuity or
awareness of which foods contain
4935.51 more or less calories than other foods
4937.46 and what the fat content
of particular foods is,
4940.1 in particular, et cetera,
4942.42 they're doing all this while in a scanner.
4945.31 And then they look at
what sorts of brain areas
4948.34 are active after that task is done.
4951.72 And what they found
was really interesting,
4953.67 what they found was that the
dorsal lateral prefrontal
4956.36 cortex not surprisingly is
involved in the decision-making
4961.55 and the evaluation of this food,
4964.14 which foods are going to be
best to eat in this context,
4967.85 which foods are going to
be appropriate for at least
4971.29 that anorexics framework
about what's okay to eat
4974.42 and what's not okay to eat and how much.
4976.349 However, there are areas of the
brain that were active after
4981.83 that decision-making process.
4983.69 And those are the brain
areas that turn out to drive
4986.73 the habit of avoiding particular foods
4989.41 and approaching other foods.
4991.48 And in that case,
4992.313 it wasn't the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex.
4994.284 It was an area of the brain called
4995.93 the dorsal lateral striatum.
4997.676 Now the striatum is a
big area in the brain.
5000.97 It's involved in a lot
of different things.
5003.09 It includes areas like
the caudate and putamen.
5005.113 And I just want to mention, as
I throw out all these names,
5007.81 you do not need to remember the names
5009.84 of these different structures.
5010.85 They're just there,
5011.683 if you are interested
in that level of detail,
5013.96 but basically you have a
brain area and anorexics
5016.17 have a brain area that's
involved in evaluating
5018.23 and decision-making around food.
5019.77 And then another brain
area that's involved
5022.17 in the reflexive consumption
of particular foods
5025.95 and the reflexive
avoidance of other foods.
5030.52 If you remember way back at
the beginning of the episode,
5034.346 I feel like that was a long time ago now.
5035.31 When we talked about how you
have these sorts of processes
5038.58 in the brain,
5039.413 but there are always homeostatic
5041.61 and reward systems influencing
this kind of thing.
5045.38 Well, in the brain of the anorexic,
5048.91 it turns out that the reward
systems have been attached
5052.76 to the execution of habits
in a way that is unhealthy
5057.04 for body weight,
5058.28 but at least from a purely
neural circuit perspective,
5061.65 the reward is now given this
chemical reward in the brain,
5065.58 is given for avoiding particular
foods and only approaching
5069.57 these very low calorie, low fat foods.
5073.43 So, there really does seem
to be a flip in the switch,
5077.32 in the anorexic brain that
rewards them internally.
5080.5 They feel good when
they avoid certain foods
5083.94 and they approach others.
5085.37 So, it's not a deprivation based model
5087.84 where they are flagellating
themselves or masochistic
5091.364 or actively avoiding food in
order to punish themselves,
5095.56 which is interesting because a
lot of psychological theories
5097.69 support that idea.
5099.12 Rather, once this transitions
into a set of habits,
5104.28 they are actually getting
a sense of reward.
5106.46 They feel good, presumably
from the release
5108.54 of a different neuromodulator
called dopamine,
5112.26 by approaching foods that are
low fat, low calorie content.
5116.4 And so their whole brain circuitry
5118.07 is skewed toward avoiding
particular things.
5121.07 And they actually are rewarded
for that, and they feel good.
5124.64 They feel better than if they were eating
5126.79 in a healthy weight supporting way.
5130.8 Now the dorsolateral
striatum is a structure
5133.44 that we should think about
in a little bit more depth.
5136.1 It's part of a set of
circuits that are involved
5138.81 in what are called go no-go tasks.
5140.87 And I don't want to go into this in a lot
5142.13 of detail right now,
5144.15 because it would take us too far down
5145.29 the rabbit hole of neurocircuitry.
5147.448 But basically in terms of behaviors,
5151.91 we both have DPO type behaviors.
5155.39 So, decision-making,
reward based behaviors.
5157.8 And we have habits that
we learn and we acquire.
5162.25 And then we just start to
reflexively, things like walking,
5165.48 things like yawning when we're tired,
5167.73 things like taking a particular route
5169.55 through the parking lot, right?
5171.16 We learned that the first time
we go to a given parking lot
5173.66 and walk into a building.
5174.493 But after that, we tend to follow
5175.63 the exact same trajectory
becomes very automatized.
5179.092 It's just like, we just
do it without thinking.
5182.27 Well, the go no-go
circuitry is another aspect
5187.98 of our behavior,
5188.813 where we both have to
select behaviors to perform.
5191.315 And we have to select
behaviors to suppress.
5194.83 And the anorexic brain
seems to reward suppression
5199.98 of one set of behaviors,
5201.29 ingestion of high calorie
foods, and to reward focus,
5206.42 or even hyper-focus and
consumption of low fat,
5210.44 low calorie foods.
5212.03 So, this homeostatic process that we learn
5214.28 about from like high school onward,
5216.27 that, oh, everything in
your body is designed
5218.19 to keep everything in balance.
5219.72 You stay awake for a
certain amount of time.
5221.28 You want to sleep, you
don't eat for a while.
5223.19 Then you want to eat to
maintain weight, right?
5225.06 You eat too much.
5225.893 Then you want to eat less.
5227.15 Those systems are disrupted.
5229.3 And so what's so beautiful about this work
5233.239 from the Columbia group,
is that what it says
5236.77 is the place to intervene
has to be the habit.
5240.78 This stuff has already passed
through all the learning,
5243.3 it's passed through
all the reward systems.
5245.26 It's clearly not being overrun
by the homeostatic processes
5248.27 of the body.
5249.103 There's very little body fat.
5250.118 There's no leptin,
5251.64 whatever neurons in the brain
respond to leptin are starved
5253.97 for leptin, periods of
shutdown, sperm production,
5257.4 and testosterone is lowered.
5259.08 Bone density is down.
5260.28 Clearly, this is overriding all
those homeostatic processes,
5264.38 all the signals that
would say eat, eat, eat.
5267.24 Those don't matter in the
brain of the anorexic.
5270.65 In the brain of the anorexic
is just performing habits
5273.77 and they're being rewarded for it.
5275.54 So, when you come along and say, look,
5277.55 you should really eat this
whole pie or this whole pizza
5279.7 you'll feel better.
5280.73 That's how she aversive to them.
5282.188 So, since it appears to be a habit,
5284.57 a reflex that's perpetuating
the anorexic phenotype.
5288.7 As we say, in science,
5289.61 it's perpetuating anorexia
in this individual
5292.51 and telling them about
all this terrible stuff
5295.02 that's happening in their body won't work,
5297.2 taking them away from all the images
5299.07 of thin people online, et cetera.
5301.06 That's not going to work.
5302.61 What's going to work.
5304.04 What's going to work is intervening
in the neural circuitry.
5307.37 That's related to the habit itself.
5310.37 And it turns out that
there are ways to do that.
5311.917 So, how do you break a habit?
5313.84 How do you rewire the brain circuitry
5315.63 that's literally causing a reflex?
5317.6 And in this case causing a reflex
5319.23 that is killing the individual,
5321.64 or at least leading to
very bad health outcomes.
5326.0 The way that you do that is
through a cognitive mechanism
5329.71 where you teach the individual,
5331.54 what is leading up to the habit?
5333.82 This is a little bit similar
to the way that somebody
5336.45 who suffers from addiction starts to put
5339.08 in different constraint type behaviors,
5342.32 constraint type behaviors,
5343.34 are the sorts of things
like where the alcoholic
5345.56 will call a hotel ahead
of time and say, listen,
5347.8 I want the mini bar taken out of the room.
5350.8 I don't want a television
in the room, et cetera,
5352.71 constraint type behaviors.
5354.17 Those are really ways of keeping oneself
5357.1 from the temptation.
5358.71 But with these habits,
5360.01 they work at such a subconscious level.
5362.33 That what seems to work best
is a combination of teaching
5366.277 the individual about their internal state
5369.96 and how to register their internal state.
5371.77 What we call interoception this ability
5373.39 to perceive your internal state,
5375.49 so that they can start to learn,
5378.05 to associate the interactions
with different types of food,
5381.75 with the sorts of cues that are
occurring within their body,
5384.88 quickening of heart rate,
5386.72 hyper acuity of focus that
we talked about earlier.
5389.85 Once they start to be able
to notice that those things
5392.01 are happening, then they
can start to intervene.
5395.0 So, let's talk about what
those things are that lead
5397.94 into a habit,
5399.929 because those turn out to
be the exact points of entry
5402.29 for changing and eliminating
and rewiring habits,
5406.0 to a more healthy behaviors.
5407.55 And I should highlight that
this isn't just about rewiring
5411.304 habits for sake of the anorexic.
5412.34 These are also the same types
of mechanisms that one would
5415.08 want to incorporate in
order to rewire any habit
5418.28 of any kind.
5419.43 There are two main features of thinking
5421.205 that go into the sorts of
habits that anorexics execute.
5426.35 The first is something called
weak central coherence.
5429.49 Weak central coherence is
essentially an inability
5432.48 to see the forest through the trees.
5435.01 It's a hyper acuity and focus on details
5438.01 within a given environment.
5439.04 And there's actually an
interesting probe test for anorexia
5442.66 that involves something akin
to kind of a where's Waldo type
5446.47 of puzzle, where an image is put up.
5450.14 The one that I saw was one
5451.21 in which there is a big
array of coffee beans.
5454.11 Actually, they're all brown coffee beans.
5455.65 And your job is to identify
where in that array
5459.69 of coffee beans, there's a face.
5461.55 And indeed there's a
face embedded in there.
5463.71 It looks a little bit like a coffee bean,
5464.99 but once you see it,
you realize it's a face,
5466.6 not a coffee bean.
5468.06 And it becomes very hard to
not notice the face after that.
5473.35 Anorexics, are very good
at identifying the face.
5477.27 They find it much faster
than do non-anorexics,
5481.19 which is really interesting, right?
5482.97 They somehow are able
to hone in on details
5485.28 and find those details and
fixate on those details.
5489.0 Now eventually, most, if not
all people find the face,
5492.05 but once you do what you will
find and what everyone finds
5495.84 is that you can't unfine
the face, it just jumps out.
5498.55 So, what essentially
you've lost is the ability
5500.57 to see the whole picture,
5502.36 because there's some
detail within that picture
5504.54 that you're obsessed by.
5506.23 So, this has kind of elements
5507.48 of obsessive compulsive disorder,
5508.9 but it's not really obsessive
compulsive disorder per se.
5513.278 So, we call that weak central coherence.
5515.787 It's a hyper acuity on
one particular feature.
5518.53 You miss the big picture.
5520.24 The other is a challenge in set shifting
5522.24 that once you identify something
5524.06 that's of particular interest
and that's driving some sort
5528.573 of reward, for the anorexic
5529.87 that would be identifying the
high-fat foods or identifying
5532.95 the one food on the table that
one could eat without anyone,
5536.22 hopefully noticing that they're
eating just the green beans
5539.67 and not touching any of the other food.
5541.44 If you ever had a meal with an anorexic.
5543.68 You might be familiar with this.
5545.45 It's kind of uncomfortable to be around.
5547.12 Actually they go through a
lot of elaborate procedures
5549.74 to kind of hide food too.
5551.53 They'll sometimes even chew food,
5552.79 hold it in their mouth and
then go to the bathroom
5554.64 and discard it things, very elaborate,
5556.41 very troubling types of
things to hear about,
5558.147 and to be around.
5558.99 But you'll notice that they push food
5560.36 around their plate a lot.
5561.44 They become masterful actually at trying
5563.83 to keep people's awareness
away from what they're doing,
5566.76 which is to hone in on these
low fat, low calorie foods.
5570.33 And they can't seem to set shift.
5571.83 They can't just relax and enjoy
the meal, because the meal
5574.85 for them is essentially
like this where's Waldo
5578.22 or find the face in the
coffee being tasked.
5580.24 They're constantly monitoring
how much people are observing
5583.59 them and trying to navigate this.
5585.73 What would otherwise be a
really pleasant circumstance
5588.28 for most people they're trying to navigate
5590.13 through this because remember for them,
5592.1 the reward is in the
avoidance of certain things
5594.97 and the acquiring of only the foods
5597.41 that their brain rewards them for,
5599.16 because those are the foods
that have been preselected
5601.26 and are now habit.
5602.299 What's amazing.
5605.25 And frankly also important
are these findings
5608.01 that once you teach anorexics,
what's happening to them,
5611.65 that they're doing this,
they are able to intervene.
5614.702 Now they need support, right?
5617.24 And another form of therapy
that seems to work well
5619.934 for anorexics that ideally is combined
5623.32 with this habit rewiring,
is a family-based model.
5628.01 Family-based models are
starting to surface a lot now
5630.6 in various therapy settings,
5632.43 therapy based models
in short are basically
5635.39 where the entire family is made aware
5637.89 of the individual's challenges
5639.54 with a particular eating
disorder or other disorder.
5642.03 And in understanding some of
the biology and psychology
5645.08 around it, they stopped
condemning the individual.
5648.43 They start to support that
individual through queuing them
5652.01 towards their own habits
that they observe.
5653.69 They give them some autonomy.
5654.96 They realize that none of
this changes overnight,
5657.22 but they're taught about
things like neuroplasticity
5659.58 and the ability to change one's brain
5661.16 in response to experience.
5662.48 And so there's a whole
internal support network.
5665.55 Now, for people that live alone,
5667.4 this isn't available to them.
5668.67 This isn't the kind of
thing that you share
5669.79 with your coworkers.
5670.623 You might involve a
close friend or a spouse,
5673.52 but it's not the sort of thing
that people that don't live
5676.63 in a family context can
really benefit from.
5680.85 All of these things
fall under the umbrella
5683.08 of cognitive behavioral therapy.
5684.94 And I should mention that
cognitive behavioral therapies
5687.34 are often done in conjunction
with pharmacologic therapies.
5691.03 I think that there's this idea
out there that it's either,
5694.1 or when often it's both.
5696.12 So, cognitive behavioral are
often combined with this habit
5699.6 recognition and rewiring approach,
5702.83 which is starting to become
more and more common.
5704.94 And I think the date on
it looked really good
5707.52 that especially when it
individuals are taught this early
5711.83 in adolescence, that there are
positive outcomes over time,
5716.242 the relapse rate of
anorexia is quite high.
5719.02 It's about 50% of individuals
will relapse at some point
5721.85 often triggered by a
stressful life circumstance.
5724.4 But the combination of
cognitive behavioral therapy
5727.57 that includes this family model,
5728.984 or at least habit reformulation seems
5731.87 to be fairly effective.
5733.41 And at present might be the
most effective treatment.
5736.1 Now there are additional
treatments starting to surface,
5738.62 and that takes us into the realm
5740.53 of chemical treatments for anorexia.
5742.79 And I just want to mention
that there are clinical trials,
5746.71 meaning legal clinical trials being done
5748.79 at Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine by Matthew Johnson
5751.1 and others, exploring how drugs like MDMA,
5755.53 which increases dopamine and
serotonin to very high levels
5758.93 or siliciden so-called magic mushrooms,
5762.02 which increases serotonin
and other compounds
5764.55 to very high levels within the confines
5767.35 of a professionally supported
therapeutic environment
5771.34 can help people rewire their brain,
5773.43 such that they can get
relief from major depression
5776.02 and various forms of trauma.
5777.41 And now eating disorders
are also being explored
5780.93 in the context of MDMA and
siliciden clinical trials.
5784.99 I do want to emphasize that
those are clinical trials,
5788.7 that those compounds are not yet legal.
5790.75 And in many cases, most
cases they are still illegal.
5795.02 I do not think that
they should be explored
5797.89 without a properly trained medical doctor,
5802.2 that the clinical trials are
essential to complete before
5805.22 one explores those
compounds in particular,
5808.54 because lately I get a lot of
emails about these compounds.
5811.45 People telling me that they've
had amazing experiences
5813.98 and relief from various things,
not just eating disorders,
5816.58 but depression, et cetera.
5818.24 However, I get an equal number
of emails from people saying
5822.59 that they worked with
some self appointed guide.
5825.129 This would be outside the
clinical trials I was referring
5827.86 to, and they are now experiencing
chronic visual, snow.
5832.18 They're getting genuine
visual field deficits.
5835.0 They are havering ticks that
they have never had before,
5838.06 they have chronic insomnia.
5839.29 So, I'm not passing judgment
on any of these compounds
5842.86 or the people that are
doing this sort of thing.
5844.51 I just want to see the clinical data.
5846.75 And I do believe that we should
wait until these clinical
5849.14 trials are done before people
start approaching the stuff.
5853.63 And that's because they
are serious compounds.
5856.7 They can open plasticity,
5858.285 but whether or not they work quote unquote
5861.599 for different types of eating disorders
5863.73 or depression and trauma, the
data are looking promising,
5867.84 but that the clinical
trials are still not done.
5870.15 And I know a number of people
are going out of the U.S.
5872.4 and into other countries
where this stuff is being done
5875.01 more regularly and there too.
5876.86 I've gotten reports back of people doing
5878.83 so-called ibogaine treatments.
5880.6 Some of you who are familiar
with eating disorders
5882.93 will immediately be asking,
well, what about ibogaine?
5885.34 Does it work?
5886.624 Does it work?
5887.457 Well, the clinical trials in
this country are not complete.
5890.85 I've heard evidence direct.
5892.6 I've heard directly from
people who have benefited
5896.95 from the sorts of things, for
treatment of eating disorders.
5899.48 But I've also heard of people
that have developed chronic
5902.13 seizure disorders from
pursuing things like ibogaine
5905.65 for the treatment of eating disorders.
5908.48 So, again, I'm not passing judgment.
5909.88 I would just like to see more data.
5911.74 And it's very important
that the safety aspects
5915.49 of safety be in place.
5916.61 So, this is definitely not
something to get renegade about.
5919.328 So, it appears that once
anorexia has established
5922.99 that habit breaking through self-awareness
5926.0 of what the habits are,
5928.34 is going to be a primary entry point.
5930.55 That might seem kind of trivial.
5932.023 You might say, well,
5933.706 could you have just told
us that in one sentence,
5935.1 but I want to return us to this model
5938.26 about homeostatic processes,
reward, processes, et cetera.
5943.39 That leads us to a place
where the short answer is no,
5946.25 you can't simply say break the habit.
5949.16 An individual needs to be informed
5951.3 about where that habit comes from.
5952.877 And the fact that what currently seems
5955.59 like a rewarded habit should
actually be a punished habit.
5960.29 Now, I don't mean by actual punishment,
5962.55 but what I mean is within the brain,
5964.599 there's been a switch
and the anorexic needs
5967.042 to learn that there's been a
switch such that what should
5970.87 be rewarding is now punished
and what should be punished.
5974.13 Starvation is now rewarded.
5976.96 The beauty of being a human
being is that knowledge
5980.77 of knowledge can allow you
to make better decisions.
5985.72 I'll say that again,
5986.553 the beauty of being a human
being is that knowledge
5988.53 of knowledge can allow you
to make better decisions.
5991.02 Now, of course, when we are
anxious, when we are tired,
5995.61 when we are intoxicated,
5998.4 we have less access to that
ability to use knowledge
6001.79 of knowledge, to intervene.
6003.76 The anorexic will often do
things that are in keeping
6006.99 with their habits, such as overexercising.
6009.22 This is a area that anyone
who's treated anorexics
6012.58 or interacted with
anorexics is well aware of,
6015.15 that they are constantly moving.
6017.26 They're constantly on the treadmill.
6018.59 They're constantly running.
6019.68 They always want to be
moving and burning calories,
6022.22 so that they can feel
okay about interacting
6024.34 with food or because they
have the distorted body image.
6027.295 Well, does breaking a habit mean
6030.98 that they should stop moving
around and exercising?
6033.36 No, not necessarily.
6034.86 There's some really
interesting studies that show
6036.83 that shifting anorexics towards activities
6040.858 that for instance, build
muscle resistance training
6044.96 and allow them to eat a bit more food
6048.09 without necessarily losing weight,
6051.7 but rather to put more
muscle on their body
6054.77 can actually be beneficial.
6056.722 Now I'm not talking about
anorexics becoming bodybuilders,
6058.79 has all body dysmorphia
associated with bodybuilding,
6061.67 but certain forms of
exercise are just catabolic.
6064.87 Meaning they break down
the amount of muscle.
6066.54 They reduce body weight, overall,
6068.89 other types of exercises
like resistance training
6072.03 or anabolic, they allow
muscle to be put on.
6075.38 And there are some interesting
studies, not a lot,
6078.26 but some interesting studies
trying to encourage anorexics,
6081.75 not to stop exercising,
6083.13 but rather to stop exercising
in this neurotic catabolic way
6087.46 of breaking oneself down,
6088.93 but rather getting them
shifted toward breaking habits
6092.61 of only approaching low
calorie, low fat foods,
6094.87 while also encouraging them to
embark on resistance training
6097.905 and to start to learn and
reward the relationship
6101.85 between exercise for sake
of making one's body strong,
6105.56 including the bones, not just
the muscles, but the bones,
6108.21 which is important,
especially in anorexics.
6110.64 And then to see food as a
way to nourish that process,
6113.84 to building a body that could
be of the stable weight.
6116.98 Hopefully there, once the
anorexic is of a healthy weight
6120.05 that they're maintaining that weight,
6121.73 but that they don't have to
constantly be on this treadmill,
6124.35 no pun intended of balancing
whatever food intake
6128.04 they have with activity.
6129.55 And along the lines of that.
6132.104 During the episode on fat
loss and metabolism as well,
6135.45 I talked about this neat
and non-exercise induced
6139.2 thermogenesis where people
who tend to be thin,
6142.51 tend to bounce around a lot.
6143.82 They're kind of fidgety
and that burns 1000
6146.694 of calories a day, anywhere
from 800 to 2000 calories a day.
6148.877 Now that can be beneficial for
the folks that are overweight
6151.882 and have a healthy mindset about food,
6153.96 but are trying to lose weight.
6155.43 And it turns out that by, you
6158.64 literally fidgeting and
bouncing around, like,
6160.27 this is why I'm doing this.
6161.877 It looks ridiculous.
6162.71 You actually burn a lot
of body fat and calories.
6165.2 That way provide you're
in a caloric deficit,
6167.32 you'll burn body fat
because body fat is not just
6169.94 a passive tissue.
6170.773 It actually receives input from neurons
6172.81 that release noradrenaline and adrenaline.
6175.04 And this neat.
6176.333 Has been described for
several decades now.
6179.24 And it actually is a pretty terrific way
6180.91 to burn off more calories.
6183.83 So, with the anorexic,
6184.88 you actually want to encourage
them to not constantly
6187.62 be trying to burn off calories.
6189.61 That can be very challenging.
6190.66 So, shifting them toward
activities like weight bearing
6194.01 activities or resistance
training that promote
6196.58 this more anabolic type of
relationship to activity,
6199.98 as opposed to catabolic can be beneficial.
6202.14 Before we move on to talking
about bulimia and some related
6204.88 disorders, I want to talk
about an aspect of anorexia.
6207.5 That's very interesting,
quite troubling in fact,
6210.85 but that has received a lot of attention
6214.36 and that's the distorted self image.
6218.11 Now, episode and depression,
6220.89 we talked about a very powerful
aspect of major depression,
6225.72 which is this anti-self
confabulation that people
6228.05 who are depressed seem
to genuinely believe.
6231.45 And even confabulate about the fact
6233.28 that they are performing poorly in life
6235.11 and that they are no good or
not, or worthless, et cetera.
6238.11 It's literally a lie that they
believe and their statements
6242.41 and their feelings and
their behaviors start
6244.14 to reflect that lie.
6245.59 They're not conscious of it.
6246.51 That's why we call it a confabulation.
6249.89 Anorexics often will see
themselves as overweight
6255.04 or imperfect in ways that
are of an obsession for them,
6258.83 they'll think, oh, you know,
6259.663 their arms are a little bit fat, you know,
6262.34 or, you know, the contour,
6264.01 their face makes they
don't like the pictures
6266.51 of themselves or they.
6268.07 What I'm describing here is
actually pretty typical behavior
6270.69 of a lot of people.
6271.75 I mean, how many people do
you know that after you take
6273.49 a picture of them, they
say, can I see the picture?
6275.43 And then they tell you that
you have to throw it away.
6277.61 That doesn't necessarily
mean they're anorexic
6279.43 or they're suffering from
some sort of disorder.
6281.4 That just means that they're
a human being that cares
6283.51 about how they appear in the world.
6285.6 We're not here to judge that
in the case of the anorexic.
6288.96 The problem seems to be that
they have a genuine distortion
6293.11 of their self image so much so
that they don't actually see
6297.93 themselves accurately, their
visual perceptions are off.
6301.89 And the reason we know this,
6303.003 it's because of some really important
6305.19 and beautiful studies that
were done with my colleague,
6308.908 Jeremy Bailenson's lab at Stanford,
6310.06 he's in the department of communications,
6311.72 he's actually collaborated
6312.81 with a Dr. Halpern that
I mentioned earlier.
6315.19 What's really interesting about
these studies is they give
6317.24 us a window into the perceptual
defect that anorexics have.
6320.876 I've actually done one
of these experiments.
6323.5 I'm fortunate to not be anorexic,
6325.06 but I've done some work
with the VR lab over there.
6327.894 And what you get to do is
you get to adjust this avatar
6331.073 of yourself to the point
where you think it's,
6332.46 as accurate as it could possibly be,
6334.66 and anorexics, really distort this avatar.
6339.26 In other words,
6340.093 they create this serious
mismatch between their perception
6343.54 of themselves and the reality.
6344.82 So, indeed it does seem to be
the case now what's relieving,
6349.03 or I should say what's encouraging
6351.41 about some of the therapies that we talked
6353.28 about before the family based model,
6354.77 the Connie behavioral treatments.
6357.296 Yes, and the drug treatments as well.
6359.63 But this habit intervention
model is that as one starts
6363.99 to shift those things,
6365.72 it does appear that the
perception of self seems
6368.47 to follow that the
perception of self seems
6371.079 to shift along with the change in habits.
6374.37 And that's a relief,
6375.595 or at least I find that reassuring
6377.36 because changing one's
perception is actually very hard,
6381.75 as somebody who's worked
almost his entire career
6384.03 on visual perception and related things.
6386.53 The perceptual apparatus of
the brain are not very amenable
6391.52 to neuroplasticity, meaning
they don't change that easily.
6394.57 Whereas it appears that the circuitry
6397.09 that's related to habit
formation, and decision-making
6399.287 and the reward, circuitry,
that stuff can be rewired.
6402.95 And so anorexics as they progress
6405.04 out of their anorexic state into one,
6407.95 which they are intervening
in their reflexes,
6411.27 gaining better habits
around food, eating more,
6414.81 more accurately, assessing foods
6417.92 and environments that
they're in related to food,
6420.47 as they change their behavior.
6421.64 And they start to put on healthy weight,
6423.14 maybe they're also doing the
sorts of exercises that allow
6425.39 them to put on healthy
weight and avoiding kind
6427.92 of extreme exercises of cannibalism
6430.2 and breaking themselves down.
6431.6 They also managed to somehow
just as a consequence
6435.35 of all that rewire their
perception of self.
6438.46 So, it doesn't seem that
trying to tell someone,
6440.62 oh my gosh, you're so thin.
6442.29 You really need to eat.
6443.4 That doesn't seem to work.
6444.92 They just don't see
themselves the same way
6447.7 that you see them.
6448.76 And so I offer that as a
point of consideration,
6451.59 if you know someone that's anorexic,
6452.94 or if you look at an
anorexic and you think,
6455.01 how is it that they are
still critical of the small,
6458.77 even nonexistent amount of body fat
6460.62 on their triceps or something?
6462.07 How is that?
6462.95 Well, it's literally that their brain,
6465.37 as it relates to perceptions,
6466.76 visual perceptions in particular,
they're completely off.
6470.17 And fortunately by changing habits,
6472.13 you rewire those circuits as well.
6474.24 Okay, so let's talk about bulimia,
6475.718 which is overeating and
then purging typically
6481.32 by self-induced vomiting or by ingestion
6483.97 of laxatives, sometimes also in concert
6487.1 with people taking
stimulants and fat burners,
6491.28 over ingestion of stimulus to
try and burn off more energy.
6493.821 And then we'll also talk
about binge eating disorder,
6496.85 which has a lot of the
same features as bulimia,
6500.01 but typically no purging.
6503.43 I'm not going to list off
all the clinical criteria
6506.47 that would allow someone
to be diagnosed as bulimic
6510.45 or binge eating disorder.
6512.47 But the general features are
that they ingest far more
6515.52 calories than they need,
anywhere from 10 to 30 times,
6520.99 their daily caloric intake,
6522.36 oftentimes within a two hour period,
6525.21 which is just a staggering
amount of food and nutrients
6529.09 in a short period of time.
6530.85 Oftentimes they're overriding
those mechanical signals
6533.51 from the body that they're full.
6534.848 It's a really troubling
thing to think about,
6538.78 but people are literally
gorging themselves with food.
6541.01 This looks a lot like a laboratory animal
6545.13 that has these AgRP neurons stimulated,
6547.292 these neurons that will eat
6548.64 until they almost burst or burst.
6551.43 So, you wonder is that these
AgRP neurons that are active
6553.88 almost certainly yes.
6555.07 That they're involved.
6556.24 Although I don't think that that's going
6557.68 to be the major point of intervention,
6560.604 but we're going to talk about
other types of interventions.
6563.72 There are a number of clinical criteria.
6565.35 For instance, if somebody
has one of these binges
6568.34 once a year, does that make them bulimic?
6570.86 Technically, no, but I certainly
6574.45 don't recommend people do this.
6576.252 If you are one of these people
6578.56 who has so-called cheat days, right?
6580.73 Some of you may be
familiar with cheat days.
6583.07 I think they're a little less common now,
6584.38 but the idea is you eat clean for six days
6587.65 or five days a week or two weeks.
6589.47 And then you have a so-called
cheat day where you just kind
6591.32 of go wild and eat whatever
you want and whatever volumes
6593.815 is that bulimia.
6595.11 And it has some of the contour of bulimia.
6598.38 If you're vomiting afterwards
or binge eating disorder,
6600.8 if you're not,
6601.88 does it constitute full blown bulimia
6603.76 or binge eating disorder?
6604.9 And it's pretty hard to say,
6606.391 the criteria that were described
6607.96 to me is that if somebody
is doing this at least once
6610.89 a month, over a period of
anywhere from two to three months,
6613.87 then it likely would qualify.
6616.24 And I certainly know people
who do these cheat days
6619.05 and by those criteria,
6621.32 they have something like
binge eating disorder.
6623.84 But in general,
6624.784 one of the hallmark features
of bulimia binge eating
6628.926 disorder is that people are
unable to control their eating.
6631.92 They're just simply,
6632.81 they're not making the
decision to have a cheat day.
6635.44 They're not making the
decision to overeat.
6637.92 They are simply driven from
the inside without question
6643.34 by way of neurocircuitry.
6645.57 They are driven from the
inside to ingest far more food
6650.12 than they need.
6651.31 And in some cases than
they would want to eat.
6654.17 So, it's a lot like the habit
6656.5 that we described for anorexia,
6658.7 it's almost like it's
turned into a reflux once
6661.946 they get going, all
the homeostatic signals
6663.89 are being overridden, all
the signals from the body,
6667.13 the leptin, the insulin, the glucose,
6670.23 all that stuff has cosmically sky high.
6672.28 And yet they're just what we,
6674.221 the nerds call hyperphagic,
they're just eating like crazy.
6680.716 So, what's going on there?
6681.549 Well, there've been a lot of ideas,
6683.303 about why this arises.
6686.54 There's the so-called
thyroid hormone hypothesis.
6690.53 That one's a tricky one.
6691.81 It turns out that cortisol
6693.71 and thyroid hormone
concentrations vary according
6697.08 to when the binge purge happened.
6700.35 So, there were some studies that looked
6701.92 at thyroid hormone levels
6703.189 and they found elevated
thyroid hormone levels.
6707.11 Thyroid hormone is involved in metabolism
6710.33 and not just the burning of energy,
6711.94 but the use of energy in
converting it to different tissues
6715.62 of the body, cartilage bone,
fat, and muscle, et cetera,
6720.255 did a whole episode on
thyroid and growth hormone.
6722.59 By the way,
6723.709 if you're interested in learning
more about thyroid hormone,
6727.47 but thyroid hormone can also
be depleted at other phases
6731.22 of the binge purge cycle.
6732.76 Now, without listing off
all the terrible things
6736.02 that happen with this binge purge cycle,
6738.24 there are a number of things
6739.32 that are really worth pointing out.
6741.44 One is that the vomiting itself,
6743.563 the use of laxatives that
can cause severe disruption
6747.22 to the mucosal lining the mucus lining
6749.91 of the digestive tract
can severely disrupt
6752.46 the gut microbiome.
6754.13 It can cause all sorts of even
a ulceration of the esophagus
6759.32 and just really terrible stuff.
6762.2 There's a lot of shame
associated with bulimia,
6765.74 oftentimes because people are
vomiting and it's hard to hide
6770.06 that vomiting behavior,
people are aware of it.
6773.1 There's some social isolation.
6774.564 So, you recall from the beginning,
6775.9 it does not appear that sexual trauma
6778.42 is a prerequisite for bulimia.
6780.59 Although sometimes it can
occur the hallmark feature
6783.29 of bulimia that distinguishes
it from anorexia,
6786.83 aside from the fact that
it's overeating as opposed
6788.76 to under-eating is a lack
6790.68 of what they call inhibitory control.
6792.82 And that might come as no surprise.
6794.358 But first of all, the bulimic,
6799.16 unlike the anorexic is hyper
impulsive and oftentimes
6804.75 has other types of impulse behaviors.
6806.67 They might have a little bit of alcohol
6808.6 and then start to eat like crazy.
6810.55 Whereas normally they're very restrictive.
6812.06 That's a common feature of bulimia,
6814.83 sometimes they over ingest
alcohol during these binges.
6818.19 Sometimes they are sexually
promiscuous, not always,
6821.98 but it's a general issue with satiety
6825.2 once they start eating and
with impulse control generally.
6828.8 And for that reason,
6829.951 many of the treatments
that you see for bulimia
6832.41 and binge eating disorder
are the sorts of treatments
6835.17 that don't seem to work so well,
6837.54 or at least most of the time for anorexia.
6840.2 So, the drugs that increase
the neuromodulator serotonin,
6843.15 for instance, fluoxetine
6846.89 also called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera.
6849.62 Those things oftentimes can
be effective in bulimia.
6853.89 Some of the drugs that are
used to treat attention deficit
6856.33 hyperactivity disorder an
ADD, a topic that we're going
6858.87 to talk about in depth
here on the podcast soon,
6862.33 some of those same drugs like Adderall,
6865.437 Vyvanse and things of
that sort can also be used
6869.1 to treat bulimia and
binge eating disorder.
6871.67 Why would that work?
6872.63 Well now you are familiar
with the prefrontal cortex.
6875.29 You probably know more
about prefrontal cortex
6876.79 than you ever wanted to,
just from this episode,
6880.164 prefrontal cortex is involved
in this analysis of duration
6884.45 path and outcome.
6885.436 Duration path and outcome
is how we avoid impulsivity.
6889.97 It's how we think.
6890.803 Okay, if this, then
that, if that, then this,
6892.95 you can imagine how for
the obsessive compulsive
6894.87 or for the anorexic, these are
circuits that are overactive.
6899.42 For the bulimic this is
the circuit that's going
6903.08 to essentially be underactive
and is under conditions
6906.42 where they think, oh, you
know, I shouldn't eat anything.
6908.66 I shouldn't eat anything.
6909.493 And then they just tear
the refrigerator open
6912.16 and plow through that.
6913.55 And then at that point they're
plowing through the cupboards
6916.23 and then they're ordering food.
6917.36 And then they're feeling
horrible about themselves.
6919.41 There do tend to be these cycles
of binge and purge followed
6923.51 by feelings of real shame
6926.02 because they just can't
control their behavior.
6928.7 And what is more embarrassing
than not being able to control
6932.327 one's behavior as an
adult or as a young adult.
6934.66 So, really the polar opposite
of what you see in anorexia.
6938.61 So, this lack of impulsivity implies
6941.27 a lack of prefrontal control.
6943.04 What we call top-down control.
6944.23 Why do we call it top-down?
6945.09 Because the prefrontal
cortex is suppressing
6947.01 the activity of deeper limbic
and hypothalamic circuitry,
6951.99 and things of that sort.
6953.62 Anytime you feel like
you want to say something
6956.69 really offensive and you
don't, that's top-down control.
6961.74 That's your prefrontal cortex.
6963.15 Anytime someone says something
6964.63 and you like grow your teeth.
6967.16 'Cause you'd know you
shouldn't say anything,
6968.88 gritting your teeth is
top-dow control, okay?
6971.67 When you explode or burst
or say the wrong thing,
6975.08 or say the thing that you
shouldn't say or do the thing
6978.15 you shouldn't do, that's
lack of prefrontal control.
6980.29 And indeed people who have
frontotemporal dementia
6982.69 due to aging or head injuries,
6984.282 see this a lot and people play sports get
6987.3 a lot frontal damage.
6989.68 They become more impulsive.
6991.26 So, bulimics have an
issue with impulsivity,
6995.63 and therefore drugs that
can increase serotonin.
6999.58 And sometimes these drugs
that increase dopamine
7002.45 and adrenaline also called epinephrin,
7005.17 will increase the tone as we
call it the dopaminergic tone
7009.32 or the, it's called adrenergic,
7012.25 but norepinephrine
levels in the brain allow
7014.93 for more top-down control.
7016.33 And that's also why
they're used to treat ADHD
7018.87 and attention deficit disorder.
7021.35 They tend to create a hyper-focus.
7023.6 They tend to push the brain into,
7025.67 these drugs tend to create a hyper-focus,
7027.23 and tend to push the brain
and general motor processing
7030.1 into one in which you think
if this, then that, if this,
7032.95 then that, so anticipating outcomes.
7035.29 And for that reason, drugs
like Wellbutrin, bupropion,
7040.21 which is an antidepressant,
7041.31 which mainly increases
the amount of dopamine
7043.99 and norepinephrine and less serotonin,
7046.78 that can also be effective
for certain types
7048.72 of binge-eating disorder is actually used
7051.996 to treat smoking, for
promoting smoking cessation
7055.09 and for depression, but
also for certain forms
7059.17 of obesity related to
binge eating disorder.
7061.6 And the data are pretty good.
7062.74 And there are timed release forms
7064.17 of this and non-time release forms.
7065.66 And I think you have to consult
with a psychiatrist in order
7069.49 to get these prescribed because
they are prescription drugs,
7071.93 but it's a very different
constellation of neurochemicals
7075.24 and brain areas and
approaches for bulimia.
7079.24 The treatment of binge eating
disorder has been explored
7082.58 from a new standpoint recently.
7085.3 And that's the work of this now,
7087.59 sadly, former colleague of
mine, Dr. Casey Halpern,
7090.38 who's at University of Pennsylvania
7093.763 that I mentioned earlier,
7094.8 they are using deep brain stimulation
7097.45 in order to treat binge-eating disorder.
7099.8 Now why deep brain stimulation?
7101.69 Well work from Dr.
Halpern and others while
7105.85 at Stanford showed that
there are particular patterns
7109.35 of brain activity in both
the prefrontal cortex,
7113.32 but also in an area of the brain
7114.96 called the nucleus accumbens,
7116.61 very important and very
relevant area of the brain
7120.28 in this context,
7121.16 and in any discussion
about motivated behaviors
7125.14 of any kind, feeding,
sex, drug relay behavior,
7127.613 people exercise compulsively,
7130.932 the nucleus accumbens
is in a ongoing dialogue
7134.67 with the prefrontal cortex
and the nucleus accumbens
7136.599 has no mind of its own,
but it's associated
7139.104 with dopamine release.
7140.45 It's part of this
so-called reward pathway.
7143.51 And what Dr. Halpern and
colleagues discovered
7146.58 is that there are particular
patterns of activity
7149.21 that ripple through the brain,
7151.15 through these prefrontal
networks and through
7153.3 this nucleus accumbens area,
those areas are connected.
7157.35 It's called Delta oscillations,
7159.01 Delta, just being a particular frequency
7161.33 of electrical activity for your aficionado
7163.72 as wonderful heart activity.
7166.41 But in any case,
7167.975 those Delta oscillations
in the nucleus accumbens
7170.89 are associated with food
reward in both mice and humans.
7175.09 Somehow this reverberatory
activity creates a perception
7179.55 in the individual that
food is hyper rewarding.
7183.677 And that's interesting,
and has allowed them
7186.642 to use a targeted deep
brain stimulation approach
7188.85 to treat binge-eating disorder.
7190.77 And this deep brain
stimulation is appearing
7193.85 to be an effective treatment.
7195.4 There's still more studies
that need to be done.
7197.91 Actually, if you think you
have binge-eating disorder,
7201.67 you can find the criteria for that.
7204.0 And you could contact Dr. Halpern he's.
7206.62 As I mentioned, he's moving
to University of Pennsylvania.
7208.67 They are recruiting patients
for these studies all the time.
7211.867 The studies are fairly invasive.
7213.64 They involve a FDA approved
approach of literally placing
7218.4 a wire down into an
area of the brain that,
7222.83 and allows the individual to
stimulate a particular brain
7226.52 area to offset some of
these activity patterns
7230.1 that lead to a elevated
sense of reward from food
7234.5 and binge eating.
7235.78 And the data looked really promising.
7237.46 Now I realize that's a
very invasive approach.
7239.72 Not everybody is going to be willing
7242.08 to have this wire inserted into the brain,
7244.53 but for people that suffer
from binge-eating disorder.
7247.12 This is a great and very
exciting potential treatment.
7252.33 Because what I didn't tell
you is that many people
7254.65 have binge eating disorder are obese
7257.18 to the point where their
health is greatly risk.
7259.84 Now, obesity causes all sorts
of shifts in the dialogue
7264.7 between the brain and body.
7266.49 Some of which you'll
recognize from earlier
7268.96 in the discussion, for instance,
7270.587 leptin signaling is disrupted.
7273.61 So, the fat there's lots of body fat,
7276.21 but even though that
body fat is secreting,
7278.57 this hormone leptin in that
signal should shut down
7281.61 the desire to eat.
7282.567 The receptors to leptin in the
brain are totally screwed up.
7286.68 And so the signal to eat is there,
7289.1 but the signal to stop
eating is not there.
7291.4 So, again, you have an
accelerator and a brake,
7293.1 and it's like, the accelerator
has always pushed down.
7295.177 Some of these brain
stimulation approaches seem
7297.59 to be able to bypass some of that,
7299.72 and of course there all
the metabolic syndromes
7302.07 and the problems with having
excess levels of body fat,
7305.75 things like insulin
resistance, type two diabetes.
7308.66 I mean, as disturbing as is to here,
7311.921 there are many individuals, actually,
7313.82 I know some who are so obese
7317.6 that they start getting bodily sores.
7319.75 They're not just bedsores,
7320.7 but they have skin sores that
are very disruptive to them.
7325.06 They don't like having these sores.
7326.84 And in addition to that,
7329.603 they can get peripheral neuropathies
7330.575 because of some of these metabolic issues.
7332.93 They're not getting enough utilization
7336.04 of the nutrients in the tissue,
7337.88 because the way that insulin
has disrupted insulin singling,
7341.55 and they actually have
to have certain portions
7343.48 of their limbs amputated, and
yet they continue to overeat.
7346.59 So, this is not an issue of
self-control that can easily
7350.85 be dealt with simply by
telling the person, look,
7352.9 you have to stop eating
or you're going to die,
7354.94 or you're going to have
your legs amputated.
7356.95 Like with anorexia,
7358.64 there's a distortion in
the relationship to food,
7361.85 but the homeostatic and the
reward aspects are disrupted.
7365.85 So, unlike anorexia,
7367.11 where it seems to be a
habit based mechanism
7370.17 with bulimia and binge eating disorder,
7373.2 something deep within the
neural circuitry is causing food
7377.139 to be hyper attractive
and the break is off.
7380.15 So, if you want to develop some empathy
7382.17 for what these people are dealing with,
7383.6 consider this, it's like driving a car,
7386.48 you get onto a grade, maybe
a 10 or 15 degree grade,
7390.64 and you're heading down
and you figure, well,
7393.67 you'll just pump the brakes a little bit,
7395.3 but there is no break, right?
7396.81 So, you start going faster
and faster and faster.
7398.93 And your only choice is
to use the accelerator
7400.82 just to coach through it.
7401.7 That's essentially what's happening
7402.97 to these neural circuits.
7404.5 So, the work of Dr. Halpern and others,
7406.42 I think is really exciting.
7408.17 And even though it's highly invasive,
7409.87 I think is going to lead
to not just some relief
7414.081 for the patients that do get
that deep brain stimulation,
7416.407 but also the identification
of what sorts of receptors
7418.41 are present in those brain areas.
7419.845 That could help.
7421.52 What that means is that once
we understand which brain areas
7426.688 are involved in disorder, and
we understand what receptors,
7429.26 those brain areas express,
7431.43 then there can start to be
additional interventions
7434.12 by way of non invasive treatments,
7436.88 things like drug treatments,
7438.85 do behavioral interventions
work for bulimia?
7441.4 In some cases, yes,
7442.365 provided that those interventions
are done early enough.
7447.32 Regardless, behavioral interventions,
7449.36 coupled with drug based interventions
7451.07 are always more effective
than either one alone.
7453.37 Fortunately, there is a
decent size kit of drugs
7457.15 that can help with bulimia.
7458.12 I mentioned some of them before things
7459.65 like bupropion, Welbutrin
some of the serotonergic drugs
7463.49 and some of the drugs
used to treat impulsivity.
7466.16 So, we have on the one hand anorexia,
7469.86 which seems to be a disruption
in habit and a coupling
7472.72 of unhealthy habits in this case,
7475.71 food restriction to the reward pathway.
7479.21 And on the flip side,
7480.41 we have binge eating disorder and bulimia
7482.83 where a very unhealthy
habit of gorging oneself
7485.58 with food sometimes followed by purging,
7488.11 is not necessarily coupled to reward.
7489.98 They feel terrible when
they do that, right?
7492.04 The anorexic feels great about restricting
7494.0 their food intake.
7494.96 They feel like they're
winning some sort of game.
7497.05 The circuitry is flipped somehow that way.
7499.765 With bulimia they feel
horrible about the fact
7503.81 that they're bingeing,
there's immense shame.
7506.01 They can't control themselves.
7508.07 The reward is set up before the behavior,
7510.98 the reward is set up
in drawing them to food
7515.05 and in making food look like something
7517.15 that's incredibly appetizing
and there's no impulse break.
7521.46 There's no way for them to
stop that kind of behavior.
7524.14 So, really kind of troubling
thing to think about.
7526.21 In either case,
7527.6 I think for those of
us that know anorexics
7530.05 or have observed anorexia,
7531.423 it's so hard to see
somebody starved themselves
7534.13 to near death or to death.
7535.7 What more could be disturbing?
7537.81 Well, equally disturbing is
somebody who has an abundance
7541.99 of food and is gorging themselves,
7543.56 and then feels terrible about it.
7545.406 So, these are heavy topics.
7548.475 These are topics that
frankly no one really wants
7552.38 to talk about unless they
know someone who is suffering
7554.44 from them, or they
themselves suffer from them.
7556.98 What I've tried to do today
is try and give you a window
7559.234 into what really underlies these things
7562.74 that we call eating disorders.
7565.12 I hope I've done that at the level
7566.41 of biology neurocircuitry
mechanism endocrinology,
7569.65 and some of the psychology,
7572.35 as with any episode of this podcast.
7574.14 But especially in this
month where we're talking
7576.14 about mental health issues
and mental health disorders,
7579.36 behavioral disorders, there's
no way that I can exhaustively
7583.25 cover all the different
forms of treatment.
7585.14 You have the modely approach,
7586.46 you've got all these different
approaches to depression,
7590.61 into anorexia, et cetera.
7591.63 What I've tried to do
is give you a framework.
7593.9 And in doing that,
7594.733 I've tried to give you a
framework of understanding
7596.7 that also applies to this question.
7599.12 That's I think equally
important and goes alongside
7602.58 the treatment of eating disorders
7603.82 is what in the world is healthy eating.
7606.26 What in the world is a
healthy relationship to food.
7608.69 I like to think that I have a
healthy relationship to food.
7610.17 I know the foods I like.
7612.22 I enjoy them.
7613.26 They're 10 or 15 foods in
particular that I liked very much.
7616.12 I've mentioned a few of
them on the podcast before,
7618.25 and I was sort of amused,
surprised and perplexed as to why.
7624.49 For instance, I do enjoy eating
butter, not in huge amounts,
7627.72 but I do like butter.
7629.34 So, that seemed to be pretty
triggering for folks out there.
7633.28 A small selection of people
decided that the ingestion
7635.52 of butter was a health concern.
7637.5 Look to me,
7640.09 ingesting butter in small
quantities is something
7643.1 that I'm comfortable with.
7643.96 And my blood lipid profiles feel good.
7646.29 They look good to me.
7647.75 For other people that
might not be the case.
7649.98 For some people.
7650.813 The idea of eating an
animal-based food is probably
7654.58 so repulsive that it actually
7657.7 can make them feel physically sick.
7659.39 And I think that we should
be aware that that kind
7662.41 of mental phenotype exists.
7663.84 I'm not calling it a pathology
for other people like myself,
7666.71 things like butter and meat feel healthy.
7668.89 Now, what quantities?
7670.02 Well, I enjoy eating very much.
7671.93 I'm not shy about this.
7672.9 I've talked about on the
podcast before, I enjoy eating.
7675.744 Some people have a very
complicated relationship to food.
7680.11 They don't think of it as nourishment.
7681.76 They don't enjoy it socially.
7682.96 It's a stressful thing for them based
7685.57 on their personal history,
7686.96 or maybe just general anxiety around food.
7690.76 And I hope that in sharing
this information about the fact
7693.97 that anytime we approach food,
these neurons in our hype,
7698.28 in the arcuate area of our
hypothalamus actually increase
7702.05 our levels of anxiety.
7703.051 This is related to that
point that Dr. Halpern made,
7704.93 which was that from an
evolutionary standpoint,
7707.018 it is advantageous to ingest as much food
7710.17 as often as possible,
as quickly as possible.
7712.56 We now know that to not be
healthy in this age of abundance,
7715.3 where calories are essentially everywhere.
7719.58 And yet a lot of people
feel anxious in anticipation
7725.48 of a meal.
7726.313 What could be useful to them?
7727.38 Well, whether or not they have
an eating disorder or not.
7730.27 It's very clear that developing
methods to calm oneself
7733.97 in the presence of any anxiety
or fear inducing stimulus
7737.14 can be beneficial.
7737.99 I've talked about some of these
episodes related to stress,
7740.85 things like the physiological
side to inhale through
7742.84 the nose and a long exhale,
7744.153 things like mindfulness
meditation certainly can help.
7747.25 There are data, a lot of
studies out there showing
7749.26 that meditation practice
can help people deal
7751.51 with eating related anxiety and disorders.
7754.51 I think as a general rule,
7755.64 trying to avoid approaching
a meal or sitting down
7758.73 to eat in an anxious state
is probably a good idea,
7761.98 but let's be realistic.
7762.91 How often can we do that?
7764.0 I think most of us are
going to have circumstances
7767.1 where we're rushing around
trying to just eat before we head
7770.01 out or get to a meal.
7771.21 And then we sit down and
we find ourselves eating.
7772.473 This is one of the first
times in human evolution
7775.98 where we mostly eat out of
a desire to consume food,
7781.11 not out of a need for food.
7783.14 Most everybody could
go a fairly long period
7786.54 of time, just ingesting
water and electrolytes.
7789.3 And not that I'm
suggesting people do that,
7790.84 but let's face it.
7792.22 We largely eat nowadays
because of a desire to eat,
7795.22 not a need to eat,
7796.76 and yet we need to eat on
a fairly regular basis.
7799.8 And so no topic is more complicated
7803.54 and nuanced than food and nutrition.
7806.57 And in particular, as it
relates to eating disorders.
7808.67 So, the major takeaways today are,
7812.03 we should all be asking the question,
7813.19 what is healthy eating for us?
7815.24 How do we develop a relationship
7816.84 to food that we can enjoy
food, hopefully both socially
7820.64 and on our own, but
that we are not neurotic
7823.9 and compulsive about it.
7824.91 For those of you that intermittent fast,
7826.55 this also applies, right?
7828.2 What, you know, God forbid,
7830.886 if you eat 30 minutes before
your eating window starts,
7832.09 what does that mean?
7832.93 If it means something catastrophic,
7834.89 do you have an eating disorder?
7836.06 I don't know.
7837.448 Maybe you have an anxiety disorder,
7838.7 that's for you to explore.
7840.62 If you don't manage to
eat five meals a day
7844.05 and that's your obsession.
7845.09 Well, then, you know,
the same thing applies.
7847.86 These are questions that
we can all ask ourselves.
7850.15 Today, we focus on the extremes
of food related behaviors
7854.6 that really qualify as genuine disorders.
7857.97 They are in the psychiatric
manuals and they are diagnosable
7861.94 and they are serious health concerns.
7864.98 They're not just mentally
troubling and concerning
7867.46 for the people suffering from them
7868.477 and the people around them,
7869.78 but they are genuine health concerns,
7871.426 just want to reiterate,
7873.1 that interaction nervosa is
the most deadly psychiatric
7876.87 disorder by a huge margin.
7879.8 And if you look
statistically at the number
7881.95 of people with eating
disorders and that die
7883.96 of eating disorders,
7885.69 it's not far off from the number of people
7887.73 that die from automobile accidents.
7889.536 I know that that sounds
like a ridiculous number,
7891.98 but you can look this up.
7893.498 This is particularly true in
certain countries, why that is,
7896.1 we don't know, but again,
this is not a new phenomenon.
7900.06 This is not just related
to body image issues
7904.48 that are created through social media.
7906.144 And as a final point on that,
7908.796 many of you are probably asking
what about plastic surgery?
7913.6 What about all the steps that
people are going through?
7916.557 Excuse me, to preen themselves
and change themselves.
7919.49 Are people addicted to plastic surgery?
7921.81 Is that a form of body dysmorphia?
7924.0 And indeed it is.
7925.932 And so we will do an
episode on exercise related
7928.48 and plastic surgery
related body dysmorphia.
7931.95 I think there is very little
question that those types
7936.53 of disorders are clearly
related to what we're observing
7941.55 in social media and in media,
7943.66 that this shift of, for
instance, action heroes.
7947.1 If you look at action heroes in the '80s,
7949.2 there were very few men
that were very large.
7951.55 You had your terminate,
7952.383 you had your stallone's
in your shorts and eggers
7954.92 and a few others, but the
men in movies tended to be,
7958.23 if they were muscular,
7959.09 they were far more
svelte than they are now.
7961.7 There's this kind of, there's a,
7963.842 literally a hypertrophy of the imagery.
7965.41 And likewise there's been hypertrophy
7968.52 of the female body shape.
7970.18 As it's portrayed in the media.
7971.53 There are body dysmorphia that are related
7975.3 to those types of things.
7976.58 And that relate to things
like plastic surgery,
7978.9 steroid abuse, diet,
drug abuse, and so on.
7983.54 Definitely important to
think about and consider,
7986.48 and definitely deserving
of its own episode.
7988.665 You've learned a lot
of neuroscience today.
7992.11 I hope that was useful in
thinking about these disorders
7994.79 and in thinking about
other aspects of feeding
7997.44 and motivated behaviors,
7998.89 I would love for you
to take away this model
8001.73 that was handed off to me,
8002.7 that I think is so powerful for thinking
8004.5 about all sorts of
things, not just eating,
8006.55 but all kinds of behaviors and perceptions
8008.3 that you have one box for what you think,
8011.56 one box for what you do
8013.25 and what is intervening between those?
8015.37 Why is it that you can know
better and not do better?
8017.558 Well it's because you also have to cope
8020.73 with the subconscious
homeostatic processes
8023.66 and reward processes.
8025.07 And those oftentimes
can be disrupted in ways
8028.55 that we find ourselves doing
things that are not good
8031.9 for us or not good for other people.
8033.29 But fortunately, there is this great gift,
8035.319 which is that knowledge
of knowledge can allow you
8038.88 to do better without question.
8041.58 And that knowledge of knowledge
allowing you to do better
8045.55 over time leads to this
incredible phenomenon
8048.04 called neuroplasticity, which
essentially is translated
8050.77 into doing better over time.
8053.03 Even if difficult eventually
makes doing better reflexive.

8100.418 to the laboratory,
8101.67 to explore the sorts of things that relate
8103.64 to neurocircuits stress,
sleep and human performance.
8106.97 Not today, but oftentimes on this podcast,
8109.37 we discuss various
compounds and supplements
8111.55 that people could possibly
take in order to help deal
8116.01 with anxiety, improve gut microbiome,
8118.48 improve their sleep, et cetera.
8120.46 We didn't discuss those today,
8121.54 but for those of you
interested in those compounds,
8123.31 if you want to see the ones that I take,
8125.18 you can go to Thorne that's T-H-O-R-N-E
8128.887 .com/the letter U/huberman.
8133.546 So, it's thorne.com/u/huberman.
8135.94 See all the supplements that I take,
8137.34 you get 20% off any of those supplements.
8139.6 And if you enter the Thorne
site through that portal,
8142.414 you can get 20% off any of the
supplements that Thorne makes
8145.09 we partnered with Thorne
8147.422 because they have the highest levels
8148.255 of stringency with respect to
the quality of ingredients,
8151.33 the precision of the amounts
of those ingredients.
8153.74 And while supplements are
certainly not required
8155.77 or necessary for anything really,
8158.34 you can always use behavioral tools.
8159.66 Many people benefit
from taking supplements
8161.3 of various kinds.
8162.2 And we do believe that getting supplements
8164.0 of the very highest quality
is going to be important
8166.14 if that's the decision for you.
8168.49 And last but not least,
8170.09 I want to thank you for
your time and attention.
8172.51 And thank you for your
interest in science.
