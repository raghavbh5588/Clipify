0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
1.92,"where we discuss science,"
and,science based tools
4.93,for everyday life.
9.27,I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor
10.97,of neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.1,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.92,Today we are discussing memory.
16.7,"In particular, how to improve your memory."
19.38,Now the study of memory
is,one that dates back
21.35,"many decades, and by now there's"
a,pretty good understanding
25.4,of how memories are formed in the brain.
27.9,The different structures involved
29.107,and some of the neuro chemicals involved.
31.24,And we will talk about some of that today.
33.67,"Often overlooked,"
"however,",is that memories
35.74,are not just about learning.
37.62,Memories are also about
placing,your entire life
40.2,into a context.
41.64,And that's because what's
really,special about the brain
43.887,"and in particular the human brain,"
46.08,is its ability to place
events,in the context
48.52,"of past events, the present,"
51.18,and future events.
52.7,And sometimes even combinations
of,the past and present.
55.01,Or present and future and so on.
57.5,So when we talk about memory
what,we're really talking about
60.32,is how your immediate experiences relate
63.07,to previous and future experiences.
66.24,Today I'm going to make clear how
67.64,that process occurs.
69.35,Even if you don't have a background
70.56,"in biology or psychology, I promise"
72.24,to put it into language that anyone
73.62,can access and understand.
75.34,And we are going to talk about
76.88,the science that points to specific tools
79.74,for enhancing learning and memory.
82.43,We're also going to talk about unlearning
84.22,and forgetting.
85.15,There are of course incidences in which
86.62,we would like to forget things.
88.41,And that too is a biological process
90.69,for which great tools exist.
93.08,"To, for instance, eliminate"
or,at least reduce
96.35,the emotional load of
a,previous experience
98.63,"that you really did not like,"
100.02,or that perhaps even was traumatic to you.
103.04,So today you're going to learn
104.93,about the systems in the brain and body
107.37,that establish memories.
109.36,You're going to learn why certain memories
111.38,are easier to form than others.
113.34,And I'm going to talk about specific tools
115.66,"that are grounded in not just one,"
117.96,"not just a dozen, but"
well,over 100 studies
120.89,in animals and humans that point
122.76,to specific protocols that you can use
125.58,in order to stamp down learning
127.96,of particular things more easily.
130.01,And you can also leverage
that,same knowledge
132.65,to better forget or unload
the,emotional weight
135.31,of experiences that you did not like.
137.57,We're also going to
discuss,topics like deja vu
140.38,and photographic memory.
142.08,And for those of you that do not
143.48,"have a photographic memory,"
145.02,and I should point out that I do not have
146.68,"a photographic memory, either."
148.53,"Well, you will learn how to use"
150.52,your visual system in
order,to better learn
152.91,visual and auditory information.
154.88,There are protocols to do this
156.61,grounded in excellent
peer,reviewed research.
159.13,So while you may not have
a,"true photographic memory,"
161.98,by the end of the episode you will
163.12,"have tools in hand, or I should say,"
164.69,"tools in mind or in eyes and mind,"
167.8,to be able to encode and
remember,specific events
171.37,better than you would otherwise.
173.38,Before we begin I would like to emphasize
174.92,that this podcast is
separate,from my teaching
176.77,and research roles at Stanford.
178.41,"It is, however, part"
of,my desire and effort
180.27,to bring zero cost to consumer
information,about science
182.71,and science related tools
to,the general public.
185.5,"In keeping with that theme,"
186.55,I'd like to thank the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
189.4,Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
191.9,Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
193.58,"with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking."
196.45,Many times on this
podcast,I've talked about
198.17,the incredible relationship
between,temperature and sleep
201.41,as well as temperature and wakefulness.
204.34,"Many people aren't aware of this,"
205.49,but waking up in the morning is in part
207.73,the consequence of your body heating up.
210.22,And falling asleep at night
and,remaining in deep sleep
213.16,is in part the consequence
of,your body temperature
215.51,dropping by one to three degrees.
218.19,So it's vitally important
that,the temperature
220.1,of your sleeping
environment,is controlled.
222.7,I've had trouble over the years
falling,and staying asleep.
226.22,"Or I should say, falling"
asleep,hasn't been
227.72,"so much of an issue for me,"
228.73,but waking up two or
three,or four hours later
230.91,has been an issue.
231.743,"Often times I'm too warm,"
233.25,I need to open a window.
234.17,I need to adjust the temperature
of,the room and so on.
237.16,Eight Sleep mattress covers are terrific
239.17,because you can program
the,specific patterns
241.42,"of temperature that you want in your bed,"
243.42,"or I should say below you,"
coming,"from the mattress,"
245.81,throughout the night.
247.2,So I've programmed my Eight Sleep
248.89,to put my mattress into
a,state of coolness
251.84,in order to fall asleep.
253.17,And then to get slightly
cooler,as the night goes on.
256.01,To get into even deeper sleep.
257.59,And then to warm up as morning approaches.
260.52,"Now, as mentioned before,"
Eight,Sleep mattresses
262.52,can be used for cooling and heating.
264.11,So some of you may actually need
265.42,to heat your mattress and Eight
Sleep's,terrific for that.
268.31,"For me, I use Eight Sleep to"
keep,the mattress really cool.
271.15,"And I have to say, even though I thought"
272.96,"I was sleeping pretty well before,"
274.73,I have not experienced the sort of sleep
276.32,that I've been getting
with,Eight Sleep until now.
279.02,By creating this descending temperature
281.73,"in the beginning part of the night,"
282.94,"cooler, cooler, cooler."
284.03,And then warming up towards morning.
285.81,It even has a nice
little,vibration function
287.55,so I wake up now to a
slightly,vibrating bed.
289.98,And the sleep that I'm
getting,is just amazing.
292.38,And I feel so much better
during,the day as a consequence.

311.44,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Thesis.
314.26,Thesis makes custom nootropics.
316.36,"And to be quite honest, I"
don't,like the word nootropics.
319.09,Because nootropics means smart drugs.
321.61,And there really isn't
a,neuroscience of smart.
325.65,"Of course, there is this"
notion,"of intelligence,"
327.73,but we now know there are lots
328.6,of different forms of intelligence.
330.32,"Also, as a neuroscientist,"
331.7,"we don't really think about intelligence,"
333.34,we think about those particular types
335.31,of operations that you
want,your brain to perform
337.8,in different contexts.
339.02,"So for instance, some"
tasks,and life experiences
342.203,require that you remember
information,better.
345.6,Other tasks and life experiences
347.97,and forms of learning involve
focus,and task switching.
350.87,"Others creativity, and so on, and so on."
353.36,So the word nootropics is too much
354.92,of a catchall or throw away
phrase,to appeal to me.
358.52,Thesis understands this.
360.11,And what they've done is they've created
361.94,nootropics that are each designed
364.3,toward a particular end goal.
366.27,"For instance, they have blends for focus."
369.08,Blend for motivation.
370.31,A blend for clarity.
371.35,They use only the highest
quality,ingredients.
373.73,Things like Alpha GPC
and,phosphatidyl serine.
376.51,I've been using Thesis for
close,to six months now
378.49,and I can confidently say their nootropics
380.35,have been a game changer for me.
382.914,I often take the clarity formula
384.34,"prior to long bouts of work,"
meaning,cognitive work.
386.83,And the energy formula
prior,to physical workouts.
389.33,To get your own personalized
nootropics,"starter kit,"
391.53,you can go online to
TakeThesis.com/Huberman.,
395.286,Take the three minute quiz

406.31,Today's podcast is also
brought,to us by InsideTracker.
409.53,InsideTracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
411.77,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
414.25,to help you better understand your body
415.81,and help you reach your health goals.
417.83,I've long been a believer
418.94,in getting regular blood work done.
420.65,For the simple reason
that,many of the factors
423.05,that impact your immediate
and,long term health
425.3,can only be assessed from
a,quality blood test.
427.85,One of the challenges
with,a lot of blood tests
429.63,"and DNA tests out there, however,"
431.34,is that you'll get the numbers back.
432.89,You'll get information
about,your blood lipids
434.49,and hormones and so forth.
436.0,But there are no directives as to what
437.37,to do with that information.
439.01,InsideTracker has solved that problem
440.5,by creating a very easy to use dashboard.
442.98,So you'll get your numbers back
444.14,and you see what's in range
and,what's out of range.
446.03,And then they will point you
447.69,to specific nutritional supplementation
449.69,and behavioral tools that
will,allow you to bring
452.78,those numbers into the
proper,ranges for you.
454.927,And I find that immensely beneficial
457.26,because just having a bunch of data
458.92,without any knowledge of
what,to do with that data
461.0,is more overwhelming than
having,"no data at all, frankly."

InsideTracker's,plans.

474.83,"Okay, let's talk about memory."
476.38,And let's talk about how to get better
477.89,at remembering things.
479.46,Now in order to address
both,of those things
481.26,we need to do a little bit
of,brain science 101 review.
484.51,And I promise this will
only,take two minutes.
486.55,And I promise that even if
you,don't have a background
488.92,"in biology, it will make sense."
491.8,We are constantly being
bombarded,with physical stimuli.
495.77,"Patterns of touch on our skin,"
497.44,"light to our eyes, light to"
our,"skin, for that matter."
501.13,"Smells, tastes, and sound waves."
503.88,"In fact, if you can hear"
me,"saying this right now,"
505.65,"well, that's the"
consequence,of sound waves
508.05,arriving into your ears
through,"headphones,"
510.14,"a computer, or some other speaker device."
512.72,Each one of and all of
those,sensory stimuli
515.6,are converted into electricity
517.77,and chemical signals by your
so-called,nervous system.
520.44,"Your brain, your spinal cord,"
521.62,and all their connections
with,the organs of the body.
523.9,And all the connections
of,your organs of the body
526.6,back to your brain and spinal cord.
528.49,One of the primary jobs of
your,"nervous system, in fact,"
530.66,is to convert physical events in the world
533.06,"that are non-negotiable, right?"
534.95,Photons of light are photons of light.
536.73,Sound waves are sound waves.
537.85,There's no changing that.
539.17,But your nervous system does change that.
541.16,It converts those things
into,electrical signals
544.33,and chemical signals which are
546.09,the language of your nervous system.
548.22,Now just because you're being bombarded
549.66,with all this sensory information
550.737,and it's being converted into a language
552.88,that neurons and the rest
of,your nervous system
554.86,"can understand, does not mean"
that,you are aware of it all.
558.41,"In fact, you are only going to perceive"
560.94,a small amount of that
sensory,information.
563.8,"For instance, if you can"
hear,me speaking right now
566.44,you are perceiving my
voice,"but you are also,"
569.69,"most likely, neglecting the feeling"
571.64,of the contact of your
skin,with whichever surface
574.01,you happen to be sitting or standing on.
576.78,"So it is only by perceiving a subset,"
579.78,a small fraction of the sensory events
581.63,"in our environment, that we can make sense"
583.65,of the world around us.
584.483,Otherwise we would just be overwhelmed
586.32,with all the things that are happening
587.66,in any one given moment.
589.52,Now memory is simply a bias in which
593.28,perceptions will be replayed
again,in the future.
597.24,"Anytime you experience something,"
599.02,that is the consequence of specific chains
601.1,"of neurons, that we call neural"
"circuits,",being activated.
604.39,And memory is simply a
bias,in the likelihood
607.58,that specific chain of neurons
will,be activated again.
612.12,"So for instance, if you"
can,remember your name
614.49,"and I certainly hope that you can,"
616.48,"well, that means that"
there,are specific chains
618.97,of neurons in your brain
that,represent your name
622.16,and when those neurons
connect,with one another
625.25,and communicate electrically
with,one another
627.41,"in a particular sequence,"
you,remember your name.
630.71,Were that particular chain
of,"neurons to be disrupted,"
634.25,you would not be able
to,remember your name.
636.45,"Now this might seem immensely simple,"
638.01,but it raises this really
interesting,question
640.84,which we've talked about before.
642.99,"Which is, why do we"
remember,certain things
645.11,and not others?
645.943,"Because according to what I've just said,"
649.07,"as you go through life,"
650.18,you're experiencing things all the time.
651.91,You're constantly being
bombarded,with sensory stimuli.
654.89,Some of those sensory
stimuli,"you perceive,"
656.92,and only some of those perceptions
659.29,get stamped down as memories.
662.07,Today I'm going to teach
you,how certain things
664.52,get stamped down as memories.
665.88,And I'm going to teach you how
667.04,to leverage that process in order
669.24,to remember the information
that,you want far better.
672.35,"Now, even though I've told you"
673.23,that a memory is simply
a,bias in the likelihood
675.38,that a particular chain of neurons
676.63,will be activated in a particular sequence
678.81,"again and again, it"
doesn't,operate on its own.
683.3,"In fact, most of what"
we,remember takes place
686.34,in a context of other events.
689.23,"So for instance, you can most"
likely,remember your name
692.83,and yet you're probably not thinking about
695.54,when it was that you
first,learned your name.
698.1,"This generally happens when we are very,"
700.13,very young children.
701.63,"And yet, I'm guessing you"
could,probably remember
705.25,a time when someone
mispronounced,"your name,"
707.62,or made fun of or name.
709.31,"Or, as the case was for me,"
711.18,I got to the 3rd grade and
there,were two Andrews.
713.89,"And sadly for me, I lost the coin flip"
716.93,that allowed me to keep Andrew.
718.16,And from about 3rd grade
until,about 12th grade
722.5,people called me Andy.
723.57,Which I really did not prefer.
725.03,"So if you call me Andy in the comments,"
727.09,I'll delete your comment.
727.923,"Just kidding, doesn't bother me that much."
730.0,But eventually I reclaimed
Andrew,as my name.
733.48,"Well, it was mine to"
begin,"with and throughout,"
735.49,but I started going by Andrew again.
738.35,Why do I say this?
739.183,"Well, there's a whole"
context,to my name for me.
742.17,And there may or not be a whole context
744.197,to your name for you.
745.66,"But presumably, if you asked your parents"
747.02,"why they named you your given name,"
749.0,"you'll get a context, etc."
750.98,That context reflects the activation
753.83,of other neural circuits that are also
755.68,related to other events in your life.
757.34,"Not just your name, but"
probably,your siblings names
760.53,and who your parents are.
761.57,"And on, and on, and on."
763.04,"And so, the way memory works is that each"
766.55,individual thing that we remember
767.96,or that we want to remember
769.04,is linked to something by either
770.71,"a close, a medium, or a"
very,distant association.
774.58,This turns out to be immensely important.
776.93,I know many of you will read
779.19,or will encounter
programs,that are designed
781.55,to help you enhance your memory.
783.63,"You know, you have these"
phenoms,that can remember
785.69,50 names in a room full of people.
788.09,Or they can remember a bunch
of,names of novel objects
791.1,"or maybe even in different languages,"
793.0,and often times that's
done,by association.
795.55,So people will come up
with,little mental tricks
798.07,to either link the sound of a word
801.29,or the meaning of a word in some way
802.96,that's meaningful for them
803.9,and will enhance their memory.
805.55,That can be done and is
impressive,when we see it
808.13,and for those of you who can
do,"that, congratulations."
810.37,"Most of us can't do that,"
812.09,or at least it requires a
lot,of effort and training.
815.27,"However, there are things that we can do"
817.56,that leverage the natural biology
819.58,of our nervous system to enhance
821.43,learning and memory of
particular,"perceptions,"
823.75,and particular information.
825.94,Let's first just talk about
827.15,the most basic ways that we
learn,and remember things
829.92,and how to improve learning and memory.
832.21,And the most basic one is repetition.
835.17,Now the study of memory and the role
837.55,of repetition actually dates back
839.05,"to the late 1800s, early 1900s"
841.69,when Ebbinghaus developed
843.41,the first so-called learning curves.
846.06,Now learning curves
are,simply what results
848.87,when you quantify how many repetitions
851.06,of something are required in
order,to remember something.
855.13,"In fact, it's been said"
that,Ebbinghaus liberated
858.01,the understanding of learning
from,the philosophers
860.6,by generating these learning curves.
862.44,What do we mean by that?
863.3,"Well, before Ebbinghaus came along,"
867.0,learning and memory were thought
868.34,to be philosophical ideas.
871.531,"Ebbinghaus came along and said, well,"
874.08,let's actually take some measurements.
876.02,Let's measure how well I can remember
878.25,a sequence of words or
a,sequence of numbers
880.61,if I just repeat them.
881.7,So what Ebbinghaus did is he would
883.12,"take a sequence of numbers,"
884.48,or words on a page and he would read them.
887.73,And then he would take a
separate,sheet of paper.
890.79,"And we have to presume he didn't cheat,"
892.76,and he would write down as many of them
894.42,as he could and he would try and keep
895.85,them in the same sequence.
897.2,Then he would compare to the original list
899.01,and he would see how many errors he made.
900.82,"And he would do this over, and over,"
902.26,and over again.
903.37,"And as you would expect,"
906.0,early in the training and the learning
908.65,it took a lot more repetitions
910.22,to get the sequence correct.
911.39,"And over time, it took fewer sequences."
913.94,And he referred to that difference
915.61,in the initial number of repetitions
918.07,that he had to perform versus
920.02,the later number of repetitions he had
922.7,to perform as a so-called savings.
925.17,So he literally thought of the brain
926.98,as having to generate a kind
of,a currency of effort.
930.69,And he talked about
savings,as the reduction
934.03,in the amount of effort that he had
935.5,to put forward in order
to,learn information.
937.78,And what he got was a learning curve.
939.0,And you can imagine what that
learning,curve looked like.
940.68,It had a very sharp peak at the beginning
942.62,that dropped off over time.
944.087,"And of course, he remembered all this"
945.56,meaningless information.
947.29,But even though the information might
948.87,"have been meaningless,"
the,experiment itself
951.7,and what Ebbinghaus demonstrated
was,immensely meaningful.
954.9,Because what it said
was,that with repetition
957.81,we can activate particular
sequences,of neurons
961.63,and that repeated activation lays down
964.64,what we call a memory.
966.12,"And that might all seem like a big duh,"
967.84,"but prior to Ebbinghaus,"
none,of that was known.
970.0,"Now, I should also say Ebbinghaus,"
972.18,"because of when he was alive,"
973.57,was not aware of these things
974.443,that we called neural circuits.
976.24,It was in 1906 that Golgi
and,Cajal got the Nobel prize
980.39,for actually showing that
neurons,are independent cells
982.86,"connected by synapses, these"
little,gaps between them
985.04,where they communicate.
986.26,"So he may have been aware of that,"
987.83,but the whole notion of neural circuits
989.18,hadn't really come about.
990.48,"Nevertheless, what the"
Ebbinghaus,learning curves
992.8,really established was
that,"sheer repetition,"
996.38,just repeating things over
and,over and over again
999.26,is sufficient to learn.
1001.54,Something that no doubt
had,been observed before
1003.59,but had never been formally quantified.
1006.89,"Now, if we look at that result,"
1010.29,there's something really
important,that lies
1012.3,"a little bit cryptic, that's"
not,so obvious to most people.
1015.56,"Which is, the information"
that,he was trying to learn
1018.94,wasn't any more
interesting,the second time
1021.48,"than it was the first, probably"
it,was even less interesting
1024.71,and less and less interesting
with,each repetition.
1026.95,And yet it was sheer repetition
1029.17,that allowed him to remember.
1031.95,Now sometime later in
the,"early to mid 1920s,"
1035.06,a psychologist in Canada named Donald Hebb
1037.53,came up with what was
called,Hebb's postulate.
1040.09,"And Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking,"
1043.09,is this idea that if a sequence of neurons
1046.95,"is active at the same time,"
or,"at roughly the same time,"
1051.53,that would lead to a strengthening
1053.23,of a connections between those neurons.
1055.41,"And many, many decades"
of,experimentation later
1058.51,we now know that postulate to be true.
1062.13,Neurons themselves are not
"smart,",they don't have knowledge.
1066.46,"So every memory is the consequence,"
1068.49,"as I told you before, of"
the,repeated activation
1071.13,of a particular chain of neurons.
1073.36,And what Ebbinghaus
showed,through repetition
1075.68,and what Donald Hebb proposed
and,was eventually verified
1079.24,through experimentation
on,animals and humans
1082.37,was that if you encourage
the,co-activation of neurons.
1086.52,Meaning have neurons fire
at,"roughly the same time,"
1090.824,they will strengthen their connections.
1093.0,It leads to a bias in the probability
1094.97,that those neurons will be active again.
1096.783,"Now, this is vitally"
important,because nowadays
1099.26,we hear a lot about how
memories,are the consequence
1102.81,of new neurons added into the brain.
1105.5,"Or that every time you learn something,"
1108.38,a new connection in your brain forms.
1110.81,"Well, sorry to break it to you,"
1111.85,but that's simply not the case.
1114.13,"Most of the time, and I"
want,"to emphasize most,"
1116.4,not all but most of the
time,when we learn something
1118.98,it's because existing
"neurons,","not new neurons,"
1122.44,but existing neurons
strengthen,their connections
1125.51,through co-activation
over,and over and over.
1128.98,"Through repetition or, and"
this,"is a very important or,"
1133.09,or through very strong
activation,once and only once.
1138.14,"In fact, there's something"
called,one trial learning
1139.94,whereby we experience something
1142.01,and we will remember that thing forever.
1145.35,This is often most associated
with,"negative events,"
1148.12,and I'll explain why in a few minutes.
1150.04,But it can also be associated
with,positive events.
1152.97,Like the first time you
saw,your romantic partner.
1157.0,Or something that happened
with,that romantic partner.
1159.69,Or the first time that you saw your child.
1162.43,Or any other positive
"event,",as well as any other
1165.1,extremely negative event.
1166.87,"So again, both repetition, and I guess"
1169.6,we could label it intensity.
1171.94,But what we really mean
when,we say intensity
1173.66,is strong activation
of,neurons can lay down
1176.51,"these traces, these circuits"
that,are far more likely
1179.87,"to be active again, than had"
there,not been repetition
1183.88,or not some strong
activation,of those circuits.
1187.25,"So with that in mind, let's"
return,to the original
1190.41,contrarian question that I raised before.
1192.77,"Which is, why do we remember anything?"
1195.8,"Everyday you wake up, your neurons"
1198.23,in your brain and body are active.
1200.18,Different neural circuits are active.
1201.82,"And yet, you only"
remember,a small fraction
1204.18,of the things that happen each day.
1205.57,"And yet, you retain a lot of information"
1207.25,from previous days and the
days,before those and so on.
1210.62,It is only with a lot of repetition
1214.29,or with extremely strong activation
1217.14,of a given neural circuit that
we,will create new memories.
1220.08,And so in a few minutes I'll explain how
1221.85,to get extremely strong activation
1224.04,of particular neural circuits.
1226.02,Repetition is pretty obvious.
1227.4,Repetition is repetition.
1229.12,But in a few minutes I'll illustrate
1231.66,a whole set of experiments and a whole set
1233.57,of tools that point to how you can get
1236.23,extra strong activation
of,a given neural circuit
1239.59,as it relates to learning so that you will
1241.22,"remember that information,"
perhaps,not just
1244.04,"with one trial of learning,"
1245.88,but certainly with far fewer repetitions
1248.52,than would be required otherwise.
1250.42,Before we go any further I want to preface
1252.22,the discussion by saying
1253.06,that there are a lot of
different,kinds of memory.
1255.06,"In fact, were you to take a voyage"
1256.72,"into the neuroscience, and"
or,psychology of memory
1260.21,you would find an immense number
1261.81,of different terms to describe
1263.03,the immense number of different types
1264.93,of memory that researchers focus on.
1267.92,"But for the sake of today's discussion,"
1269.38,I really just want to
focus,"on short term memory,"
1271.8,"medium term memory, and longterm memory."
1274.45,"And while there is still debate,"
1276.37,as is always the case
with,"scientists, frankly,"
1278.53,about the exact divisions between
1280.01,"short term, medium, and longterm memory,"
1282.16,we can broadly define short term memory
1285.41,and longterm memory.
1286.78,And we can describe a
couple,different types
1288.65,of those that I think you can relate to
1290.64,in your everyday life.
1292.05,The most common form of short term memory
1293.7,that we're going to focus
on,is called working memory.
1296.22,Working memory is your ability to keep
1298.69,a chain of numbers in mind
for,some period of time
1301.92,but the expectation really isn't
1304.22,that you would remember
those,numbers the next day
1306.83,and certainly not the next week.
1308.26,So a good example would be a phone number.
1309.82,"If I were to tell ya a phone number,"
1311.35,"493-2938, well you could"
probably,remember it.
1314.957,493-2938.
1317.01,But if I came back tomorrow and asked you
1319.47,"to repeat that chain of numbers,"
1320.74,most likely you would not.
1322.47,"Unless, of course, we"
used,a particular tool
1325.21,to stamp down that memory into your mind
1327.22,and commit it to longterm memory.
1330.09,"Now of course, in this day in age,"
1331.62,most people have phone numbers
programmed,into their phone
1334.14,and they don't really have to
remember,the exact numbers.
1336.67,It's usually done by contact
identity,and so forth.
1340.94,So a different example that some of you
1342.7,are probably more familiar with
1344.1,would be those security codes.
1345.93,So you try and log unto
an,app or a website
1348.21,and it asks you for a security code
1349.9,that's been sent to your text messages
1351.6,and you can either plug that in directly
1353.38,"in some cases, or you have to remember"
1355.439,that short sequence of anywhere usually
1357.148,"from six to seven,"
sometimes,eight numbers.
1358.82,"Your ability to do that,"
to,switch back and forth
1360.9,between web pages or apps
and,plug in that number
1365.6,by remembering the sequence
and,"plugging it in,"
1367.82,by texting or keying
it,"in on your keyboard,"
1370.84,that's a really good
example,of working memory.
1373.15,"Longterm memory, of the sort that we're"
1374.66,going to be talking a lot about today
1376.47,is your ability to commit certain patterns
1378.59,"of information, either"
cognitive,information
1380.86,or motor information.
1382.48,"Right, the ability to move your limbs"
1383.88,in a particular sequence.
1385.6,Over long periods of time.
1387.053,"Such that you could remember it a day,"
1389.36,"or a week, or a month,"
or,maybe even a year
1391.1,or several years later.
1392.92,So we've got short term
memory,and longterm memory.
1394.64,And we've got this working memory
1395.95,which is sort of keeping something online
1398.18,but then discarding okay.
1400.04,"Not online on a computer,"
1401.14,but online within your brain.
1403.71,There are also two major
categories,of memory
1405.43,that I'd like you to know about.
1406.58,One is explicit memory.
1408.51,So this is not necessarily explicit
1410.76,of the sort that you're
used,to thinking about.
1413.01,But rather the fact that you
can,declare you know something.
1416.47,So you have an explicit
memory,of your name.
1419.54,Presumably you have an explicit memory
1421.77,of the house or the apartment
that,you grew up in.
1424.36,You know something and
you,know you know it.
1426.73,And you can declare it.
1427.74,"So I can ask you, what was the color"
1429.4,of the first car that you owned?
1431.83,Or what is the color of your
romantic,partner's hair?
1436.7,These sorts of things.
1438.176,That's an explicit declarative memory.
1439.77,But you also have explicit
procedural,memories.
1444.13,"Now procedural memories,"
as,"the name suggests,"
1446.35,involve action sequences.
1448.647,"The simplest one, it's"
almost,"ridiculously simple,"
1451.66,is walking.
1452.493,"If I say, how is it that you walk"
1454.56,from one room to the other?
1455.83,"You'd probably say,"
"well,",I go that direction
1457.51,and then I turn left.
1458.343,"I say, no, no, no."
1459.176,How is it exactly that you do it?
1460.507,"You say, well, I move my left foot,"
1462.27,"then my right foot, then my left foot."
1464.12,And you could describe that.
1465.9,So it's an explicit procedural memory.
1468.0,So much so that if you were going
1469.18,"to teach a young toddler how to walk,"
1471.62,you would probably say
"okay,","good, good, try."
1473.9,"Okay, then you know, probably"
that's,going to be pre-language
1476.27,for the toddler.
1477.65,But you're going to encourage them
1479.24,to move one leg then the other.
1480.62,And you're going to
encourage,and reward them
1483.13,for moving one leg then the other.
1484.75,Because you have an explicit
1486.21,procedural memory of how to walk.
1489.02,"Okay, almost ridiculously simple."
1490.62,"Maybe even truly ridiculously simple,"
1492.71,"but nonetheless, when you think about it"
1494.66,in the context of neural
circuits,"and neural firing,"
1496.68,pretty amazing.
1498.28,Even more amazing is the fact that all
1501.61,"explicit memories, both declarative"
1505.16,and procedural explicit memories
1507.9,can be moved from explicit to implicit.
1512.0,What do I mean by that?
1513.02,"Well, in the example of walking"
1515.57,you might have chuckled a little bit
1516.64,"or kind of shook your head and said,"
1518.21,this is a ridiculous thing to ask.
1519.78,How do I walk from one room to the next?
1521.22,I just walk.
1522.053,I just do it.
1522.95,"Ah, well, what is just do it?"
1525.01,"What it is, is that you have"
an,implicit understanding.
1528.42,Meaning your nervous
system,knows how to walk
1532.96,without you actually having to think about
1535.5,what you know about how to walk.
1537.14,You just get up out of your chair
1538.44,or you get up out of bed and you walk.
1541.61,In the brain you have a structure.
1543.3,"In fact, you have one on"
each,side of your brain.
1546.0,It's called the hippocampus.
1547.49,The hippocampus literally means seahorse.
1549.91,Anatomists like to name
brain,structures after things
1552.84,that they think those
brain,structures resemble.
1555.52,"When I look at the hippocampus,"
1557.15,"frankly, it doesn't look like a seahorse."
1559.01,Which either reflects
my,lack of understanding
1561.47,of what a seahorse really
looks,"like, a visual deficit,"
1563.84,or I think it's fair to say
1565.5,that those anatomists
were,using a little bit
1567.35,of creative elaboration
when,thinking about
1570.417,what the hippocampus looks like.
1572.27,"Nonetheless, it is a curved structure."
1575.4,It has many layers.
1577.22,It's been described by my
colleague,Robert Sapolsky
1579.457,and by others as looking
more,like a jelly roll
1582.66,"or a cinnamon roll, is"
what,it looks like to me.
1585.76,"And if you were to take one cinnamon roll,"
1588.04,chop it down the middle.
1589.74,So now you've got two half cinnamon rolls
1592.1,and rather than put them back together
1593.96,"in the configuration they were before,"
1595.307,you just slide one down so that you've got
1598.73,essentially two C's.
1600.22,Two C-shaped halves of this cinnamon roll
1603.43,"and you push them together, right,"
1605.46,slightly off set from one another.
1607.22,"Well, that's what the"
hippocampus,looks like to me.
1609.36,And I think that's a
far,better description
1611.59,of its actual physical structure.
1613.35,But I guess if you were to
use,that physical structure
1616.61,"as the name, well then"
you'd,have to open up
1617.82,a brain atlas and it would be called
1619.75,two half-C cinnamon rolls
stuffed,halfway together.
1622.14,So that's not very good.
1622.973,"So I guess, seahorse will work."
1624.64,Hippocampus is the name of this structure
1627.18,"and it is the site in your brain,"
1630.23,"and again, you have one on"
each,"side of your brain,"
1633.17,in which explicit declarative
memories,are formed.
1637.51,It is not where those memories
are,stored and maintained.
1641.25,It is where they are
established,in the first place.
1645.27,"In contrast, implicit memories,"
1648.28,"the subconscious memories,"
are,formed and stored
1652.58,elsewhere in the brain.
1654.36,"Mainly by areas like the cerebellum,"
1656.22,"but also the neocortex,"
1657.35,the kind of outer shell of your brain.
1659.23,The cerebellum literally means mini-brain.
1662.23,And it does in fact
look,like a mini-brain.
1664.19,And is in the back of the brain.
1665.71,And the neocortex is the
outer,part of the brain
1667.96,that covers all the other stuff.
1669.95,"So, the hippocampus is vitally important"
1673.45,for establishing these
"new,",declarative memories
1676.22,of what you know and
what,you know how to do.
1680.29,"Now, in order to really"
understand,the role
1682.38,of the hippocampus in
"memory,",in particular
1684.36,"explicit declarative, and"
explicit,procedural memory
1688.04,and to really understand
how,that's distinct
1690.38,from implicit declarative and
implicit,procedural memories
1695.571,we have to look to a clinical case.
1697.627,And the clinical case
that,I'm referring to
1699.33,is a patient who went by the name HM.
1702.18,Patient's go by their initials in order
1704.15,to maintain confidentiality
of,their real identity.
1707.56,HM had what's called intractable epilepsy.
1711.54,"So he would have these really dramatic,"
1713.94,so-called grand mal
"seizures,",or drop seizures.
1717.15,For those of you that know
somebody,"with epilepsy,"
1719.58,"or that have epilepsy, you"
might,be familiar with this.
1723.73,"You can have petite mal seizures,"
which,are minor seizures.
1727.13,"You can have tonic clonic seizures,"
1728.59,which are sometimes not even detectable.
1730.37,You can have absent seizures where people
1731.85,"will just stop, it's"
almost,as if their brain
1733.83,kind of goes on pause and
they'll,just stop there.
1735.66,It was reported actually that
Einstein,had absent seizures.
1739.15,Although I don't know that's ever
1740.25,really been confirmed neurologically.
1744.69,Grand mal seizures are extremely severe
1746.84,and that's what HM had.
1748.22,So he could just be going about his day
1750.19,"and maybe even cooking, or"
doing,"something, driving,"
1753.52,"operating any kind of machinery,"
1754.78,and then all of a sudden
he,would just have
1756.59,a drop seizure.
1757.52,So he would just physically drop
1758.97,and go into a grand mal seizure.
1760.4,"So convulsing of the whole body,"
1762.21,"loss of consciousness, etc."
1764.32,Or he would feel it coming on.
1766.37,Often times people with epilepsy
1767.72,can feel the epileptic seizure coming on.
1769.73,Kind of like a wave from
the,back of the brain.
1772.31,And sometimes they can get
1773.45,"to a safe circumstance, but not always."
1775.24,And so the frequency and the
intensity,of his seizures
1778.28,were so robust that the neurosurgeons
1781.23,and neurologists decided
that,they needed to locate
1783.7,"the origin, what they call the foci"
1786.14,"of those seizures, and"
remove,that brain tissue.
1789.5,Because the way seizures work
1791.14,"is they spread out from that focus,"
1793.35,or that foci of brain tissue.
1796.53,"And unfortunately for HM,"
1799.02,the focus of his seizures
was,the hippocampus.
1802.26,"So after a lot of deliberation,"
1804.81,"a neurosurgeon, in fact"
one,of the most famous
1806.71,"neurosurgeons in the world at that time,"
1809.94,"made what are called electrolytic lesions,"
1811.89,actually burned out the
hippocampus,in the brain of HM.
1816.32,"And as a consequence, he"
lost,all explicit memory.
1820.87,Now the consequence of this
1822.12,"was that he couldn't exist in normal,"
1824.14,"everyday life, like most people."
1826.12,"So he had to live mostly, not entirely,"
1828.87,but mostly in a kind of hospital setting.
1831.98,And I've talked to
several,"people, who have"
1835.52,"I should say, who met HM directly,"
1837.94,because he's no longer alive.
1840.01,But an interaction with him
might,look like the following.
1844.19,He would walk up to you just fine.
1845.91,You wouldn't know that he
had,any kind of brain damage.
1849.27,"He could walk fine, he could speak fine."
1851.5,"And you'd say, hi, I'm Andrew."
1853.37,"And he'd say, hi, I'm whatever"
his,name happened to be.
1856.01,"He wouldn't say HM, but he'd"
probably,say his real name.
1858.75,And then perhaps someone new
would,walk into the room.
1862.25,"He might turn around, look at that person,"
1863.91,as any of us might do.
1865.67,Then turn around back to me
and,"say, hi, what's your name?"
1870.41,"And if I were to say, well,"
I,just told you my name.
1872.54,And you just told me your
"name,",do you remember that?
1875.021,"And he'd say, I'm sorry, I"
don't,remember any of that.
1876.83,What's your name?
1877.663,So you'd go through this
over,and over again.
1879.24,So a complete lack of
explicit,declarative memory.
1882.87,Now he did have some memory for
1886.33,previous events in his life
that,"dated way back, okay."
1890.24,"Again, hinting at the idea that memories"
1893.4,are not necessarily
stored,"in the hippocampus,"
1896.46,they're just formed in the hippocampus.
1897.95,So once they've moved
out,of the hippocampus
1899.51,"to other brain areas, he could"
still,keep those memories.
1902.3,They're in a different
"database,",if you will.
1904.01,They're in a different pattern of firing
1905.48,of other neural circuits.
1906.6,But he couldn't form new memories.
1908.31,Now there's some very important
1909.83,and interesting twists on what HM could
1912.71,and could not do in terms
of,learning and memory
1915.21,that teach us a lot about the brain.
1916.85,"In fact, I think most"
neuroscientists,would agree
1919.13,that this unfortunate
case,of HM's epilepsy
1922.16,and the subsequent neuro
surgery,that he had
1924.64,"taught us much of what we know,"
1926.37,"or at least think about,"
1927.33,in terms of human learning and memory.
1929.71,"For instance, as I mentioned before,"
1931.62,he still had implicit knowledge.
1933.96,He knew how to walk.
1934.85,He knew how to do certain things like
1936.53,make a cup of coffee.
1937.93,He knew the names of people
1939.97,that he had met much earlier
in,"his life, and so on."
1943.95,And yet he couldn't form new memories.
1946.09,"Now, in violation to that last statement,"
1949.42,there were some elements
of,HM's emotionality
1952.96,that suggests that there was some sort
1954.74,of residual capacity to
learn,new information
1958.1,but it wasn't what we normally think of
1960.54,as explicit declarative
or,procedural memory.
1963.13,"For instance, it's been reported"
1965.84,"or it's been said, I should say,"
1967.55,because I don't know that the studies
1969.04,were ever done with intense
physiological,"measurements,"
1971.89,"that if you were to tell HM a joke,"
1974.86,"and he thought it was funny,"
he,would laugh really hard.
1978.41,"He liked jokes, so you'd say hey, HM,"
1980.209,I want to tell you a joke.
1981.8,You tell him a joke and
he'd,laugh really hard.
1983.98,"Then you could leave the room, come back,"
1986.02,and tell him the same joke again.
1988.01,"Now keep in mind, he did not remember"
1989.73,that you told him the joke previously.
1991.75,And the second time he would
laugh,a little bit less.
1994.63,And then you'd leave the
"room,",come back again.
1997.28,"Say hi, I'm Andrew."
1998.928,"And he'd say, oh, nice to meet you."
2000.467,"Because as you know, as you recall,"
2002.04,because you can recall things.
2003.07,But he couldn't recall things.
2004.49,He didn't know that he just met you.
2005.82,Or at least he couldn't remember it.
2007.29,You tell him the joke a
third,"time, or a fourth time,"
2009.37,and with each subsequent
telling,of the joke
2011.81,he found it a little less funny.
2013.47,"Just as, keep this in mind, folks,"
2016.4,if you tell a joke and
you,"get a big laugh,"
2019.22,don't tell it again.
2020.66,At least not immediately.
2022.1,Not to the same person or the same crowd
2024.41,because the second time
it's,a little less funny
2026.447,and the third time it's
a,little less funny.
2028.02,And that actually has to
do,with a whole element
2030.25,of dopamine and it's
relationship,to surprise.
2033.41,And that's the topic of a future podcast
2035.31,where we talk all about humor
and,novelty in the brain.
2038.45,But the point being that
certain,forms of memory
2042.19,seem to exist in a kind
of,phantom like way
2045.04,within HM's brain.
2046.44,What do I mean by that?
2047.34,"Well, this underscores that he had"
2049.91,an implicit memory of having
heard,the joke before.
2053.64,"And it suggests that humor, or"
at,"least what we find funny,"
2056.76,is somehow more related to procedures.
2059.35,Similar to walking or a motor ability
2061.58,than it is to this precise
content,of that joke.
2065.65,"All right, that's a little"
bit,"of an abstract concept,"
2067.51,but the point is that HM lacked
explicit,declarative memory.
2071.36,He couldn't tell you
what,he had just heard.
2074.06,He could not learn new information.
2076.14,And he couldn't tell
you,how to do something
2078.65,unless he had learned
how,to do that something
2080.97,many years prior.
2082.92,"Now, there have been a lot"
of,other patients besides HM
2085.66,that have had brain
lesions,"due to epilepsy,"
2089.24,or I should say due to
surgeries,"to treat epilepsy,"
2092.02,"due to strokes, due to"
sadly,gunshot wounds
2095.62,and other forms of what
we,"call infarcts, infarct."
2099.75,"I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct is the word we use"
2104.46,to describe damage to a
particular,brain region.
2107.22,And many different patients
with,many different patterns
2110.28,of infarct have taught
us,a lot about how memory
2113.767,and other aspects of the brain work.
2116.71,HM really teaches us that what we know
2121.32,and what we are able to
do,is the consequence
2124.22,of things that we are aware of
2126.08,and learnings that have been passed off
2128.24,"into subconscious knowledge,"
that,our body knows.
2131.04,"Our brain knows, but we don't know exactly"
2133.97,how we know that thing.
2135.59,And I tell you the
story,about HM's ability
2138.01,"to understand a joke, but"
that,with repeated telling
2141.92,of the joke it has less and less and less
2143.68,of an impact in creating
a,"sense of laughter,"
2147.14,of humor in HM.
2150.29,Not as just an anecdote
to,"flesh out his story,"
2153.33,but because emotion itself turns out
2156.6,to be the way in which
we,can enhance memories
2159.67,even if those are memories for things
2161.59,"that are not funny, are not intensely sad,"
2164.33,are not immensely happy or don't evoke
2168.41,"a really strong emotional response,"
2170.19,or even any emotional response.
2173.02,"And the reason for that is that emotions,"
2175.8,"just like perception, just like sensation,"
2178.67,are the consequence of
particular,neuro chemicals
2181.14,being present in our brain and body.
2182.72,"And as I'm going to tell you next,"
2184.82,there are particular neuro chemicals
2186.96,that you can leverage in order to learn
2189.22,specific information
faster,and to remember it
2192.51,"for a much longer period of time,"
2194.2,maybe even forever.
2195.61,And you can do that by leveraging
2197.04,the relationship in your nervous system
2199.12,between your brain and your body.
2201.5,And your body back to your brain.
2204.29,So let's talk about tools
for,enhancing memory.
2206.86,Now there's one tool that
it's,absolutely clear works.
2211.38,"And it's always worked, it works now,"
2213.9,and it will work forever.
2216.3,And that's repetition.
2218.37,The more often that you perform something
2220.5,"or that you recite something,"
2222.4,the more likely you are to
remember,it in the future.
2225.72,"And while that might seem obvious,"
2227.41,it's worth thinking about what's happening
2229.61,when you repeat something.
2231.03,"But when I say what's happening,"
2232.29,I mean at the neural level.
2233.87,What's happening is
that,you're encouraging
2236.04,the firing of particular chains of neurons
2238.93,that reside in a
particular,"circuit, right."
2241.22,So a particular sequence
of,neurons playing
2243.11,"neuron A, B, C, D played"
in,that particular sequence
2246.16,over and over and over again.
2247.95,"And with more repetitions,"
you,get more strengthening
2251.35,of those nerve connections.
2253.34,"Now, repetition works but"
the,problem for most people
2257.74,"is they either don't have the patience,"
2260.06,"they don't have the time,"
2260.91,and sometimes they literally
don't,have the time
2262.46,because they've got a deadline
2264.14,on something that they're
trying,to remember and learn.
2267.26,Or they simply would like to be able
2269.43,to remember things better in general
2271.79,and remember them more quickly.
2273.86,This process of accelerating
repetition,based learning
2277.68,so that your learning curve doesn't go
2279.72,from having to perform
something,"1,000 times"
2282.63,and then gradually over time
it's,"1,000, 750 times a day,"
2286.36,"500 times a day, 300 times a day,"
2288.66,"and down to no repetitions, right?"
2290.43,You can just perform
that,thing the first time
2292.68,and every time.
2293.83,"Well, there is a way to shift that curve"
2296.88,so that you can essentially
establish,stronger connections
2300.96,between the neurons that are involved
2302.87,in generating that memory
or,behavior more quickly.
2306.84,How do you do that?
2307.7,"Well, in order to answer that we have"
2309.57,to look at the beautiful
work,of James McGaugh
2313.23,and Larry Cahill.
2314.71,James McGaugh and Larry Cahill did
2316.48,a number experiments over
several,decades really
2319.27,"based on a lot of animal literature,"
2321.49,but mainly focused on humans
2324.18,that really established what's required
2327.01,to get better at remembering things
2329.63,and to do so very quickly.
2331.67,I want to talk about one
experiment,that they did
2333.9,that was particularly important.
2335.737,"And we will provide a link to this paper,"
2337.57,"it's some years old now,"
2339.0,but the results still hold up.
2340.75,"In fact, the results established"
2342.3,an entire field of memory and
neuroscience,and psychology.
2346.03,What they did is they had human subjects
2348.94,come into the laboratory and to read
2350.92,a short paragraph of about 12 sentences.
2354.48,And the key thing is
that,some subjects read
2357.56,a paragraph that was pretty mundane.
2360.97,"The content, the information"
within,the paragraph
2363.5,was all related to the content
of,the previous sentence.
2366.36,So it was a cogent paragraph.
2367.84,"Right, it just wasn't a"
meaningless,scramble of words.
2371.01,But it described a kind of
mundane,set of circumstances.
2375.18,Maybe it would be a story about someone
2376.8,"who walked into a room,"
sat,"down at a desk,"
2379.55,"wrote for a little bit, then got up"
2381.18,and had lunch.
2382.013,"You know, just kind of"
mundane,information.
2384.1,Not very interesting.
2385.75,Another group of subjects read also
2388.67,a 12 sentence paragraph.
2390.73,But that paragraph included a subset
2393.67,of sentences that had a lot of
emotionally,intense language.
2398.1,Or that had language that could evoke
2400.56,an emotionally intense response
2402.13,in the person reading it.
2403.36,So it might have talked
about,a car accident
2405.46,or a very intense surgery.
2407.64,But it also could be positive stuff.
2409.78,"Things like a birthday party,"
2412.28,or a celebration of some other kind.
2414.0,Or a big sports win.
2415.6,"So in other words, you have"
two,conditions of this study.
2418.47,"People either read a boring paragraph,"
2420.73,or they read a really
emotionally,laden paragraph.
2423.54,"And again, the emotions could either be"
2425.07,positive or negative emotions.
2427.95,Subjects left the laboratory
and,sometime later
2430.34,they were called back to the laboratory
2432.09,"and I should say, at no"
point,in the experiment
2434.74,did they know they were
part,of a memory experiment.
2436.83,"Okay, they don't even know why"
2437.84,they were reading this paragraph.
2439.05,They came in either for
class,credit or to get paid.
2441.78,That's typically how these things are done
2442.95,on college campuses or elsewhere.
2445.23,They come back into the lab
2446.9,and they would get a pop quiz.
2449.65,They would be asked to recall the content
2452.17,of the paragraph that
they,had read previously.
2455.53,"Now as is probably expected,"
perhaps,"even obvious to you,"
2459.75,the subjects that read the
emotionally,intense paragraph
2463.72,remembered far more of the
content,of that paragraph
2466.55,and were far more accurate
2468.96,in their remembering of that information.
2471.72,"Now, that particular"
finding,wasn't very novel.
2475.49,Many people had previously described
2477.44,how emotionally intense events
2479.76,are better remembered than
non-emotionally,intense events.
2482.81,"In fact, way back in the 1600s"
2484.72,"Francis Bacon, who's largely credited"
2486.74,"with developing the scientific method,"
2489.37,"said, quote, memory is"
assisted,by anything
2492.15,that makes an impression
on,a powerful passion.
2494.33,"Inspiring fear, for example,"
2495.98,"or wonder, shame, or joy."
2498.43,Francis Bacon said that in 1620.
2500.91,So Jim McGaugh and Larry Cahill
2502.75,were certainly not the first
2504.8,to demonstrate or to conceive of the idea
2507.73,that emotionally laden experiences
2510.1,are more easily remembered
than,other experiences.
2513.5,"However, what they did next"
2515.42,was immensely important for
our,understanding of memory
2518.34,and for our building of tools
2520.93,to enhance learning and memory.
2523.45,What they did was they evaluated
2526.28,the capacity for stress and for particular
2529.22,neuro chemicals associated with stress
2531.49,to improve our ability
to,learn information.
2534.43,"Not just information that is emotional,"
2537.65,but information of all kinds.
2539.97,So I'm going to describe
some,experiments done
2541.61,"in animal models just very briefly,"
2543.43,and then experiments
done,on humans subjects.
2546.66,"Because McGaugh worked mainly on animals,"
2548.95,also human subjects.
2550.12,"Larry Cahill, almost"
exclusively,on human subjects.
2554.27,If you take a rat or a mouse
2556.35,and put it in an arena
where,at one location
2559.99,the animal receives an electrical shock
2563.31,"and then you come back the next day,"
2564.67,you remove the shock evoking device
2567.31,and you let the animal
move,"around that arena,"
2569.52,"that animal will, quite understandably,"
2571.5,avoid the location where it was shocked.
2574.0,So called conditioned place aversion.
2577.3,That affect of avoiding
that,particular location
2580.68,occurs in one trial.
2581.81,That's a good example
of,one trial learning.
2583.96,So somehow the animal knows
2585.99,"that it was shocked at that location,"
2588.2,it remembers that.
2589.83,It is a hippocampal dependent learning.
2592.32,So animals that lack a hippocampus
2594.21,or who have their
hippocampus,pharmacologically
2596.29,"or otherwise incapacitated, will not learn"
2599.67,that new bit of information.
2601.92,"But for animals that do, they remember it"
2605.16,after the first time and every time.
2607.74,"Unless, you are to block the release"
2611.28,of certain chemicals in the brain and body
2613.0,and the chemicals I'm
referring,"to are epinephrine,"
2616.31,"adrenaline, and to some"
extent,the corticosterones.
2620.12,Things like cortisol.
2621.76,Now we know that the effect
of,getting one trial learning
2624.41,"somehow involves epinephrine,"
2626.37,at least in this particular
experimental,scenario.
2629.2,Because if researchers do
the,"exact same experiment,"
2632.92,and they have done the
exact,"same experiment,"
2634.9,but they introduce a
pharmacological,blocker
2638.43,"of epinephrine, so that"
epinephrine,is released
2641.41,"in response to the shock,"
2642.49,but it cannot actually
bind,to its receptors
2645.24,"and have all its biological effects,"
2647.38,well then the animal is perfectly happy
2649.33,to tread back into the area
where,it received the shock.
2652.73,"It's almost as if it didn't know,"
2654.31,"or we have to assume, it didn't remember"
2657.17,that it received the
shock,at that location.
2659.72,So it all seems pretty
obvious,when you hear it.
2661.43,"Something bad happens in a location,"
2662.67,you don't go back to that location.
2664.18,So that's condition place avoidance.
2666.42,But it turns out that the
opposite,is also true.
2669.2,Meaning for something called
condition,place preference
2672.45,"you can take an animal,"
put,"it into an arena,"
2674.81,feed it or reward it
some,how at one location
2678.14,in that arena.
2678.973,So you can give a hungry rat or mouse food
2681.07,"at one particular location,"
2683.42,"take the animal out,"
come,back the next day.
2685.4,"No food is introduced, but it will go back"
2687.18,to the location where
it,received the food.
2689.21,Or you can do any variant of this.
2690.72,You can make the arena a little bit chilly
2692.26,and provide warmth at that location.
2694.3,Or you can take a male animal.
2697.37,And it turns out male rats and mice
2699.39,will mate at any point.
2700.56,Or a female animal
that's,at the particular
2702.3,so called receptive
phase,of her mating cycle
2704.23,and give them an opportunity to mate
2705.85,"at a give location, they'll"
go,back to that location
2707.63,and wait away.
2708.463,This is perhaps why people go back
2709.61,"to the same bar, or the seat at the bar,"
2711.86,or the same restaurant and wait
2713.54,"because of the one time they, you know,"
2714.92,things worked out for them.
2716.29,Whatever the context was.
2718.28,Condition place preference.
2720.99,Condition place preference as
with,condition place avoidance
2725.25,depends on the release
of,"adrenaline, right."
2728.31,It's not just about stress.
2730.23,It's about a heightened emotional state
2732.94,in the brain and body.
2734.32,"Okay, this is really important."
2735.51,It's not just about stress.
2737.29,You can get one trial learning
2738.49,"for positive events,"
condition,place preference.
2740.96,And you can get one trial
learning,for negative events.
2745.62,"Here I say positive and negative,"
2747.32,I'm putting what's called valence on it.
2748.81,Making a value judgment about whether not
2750.92,the animal liked it or didn't like it.
2752.4,And we have to presume
what,the animal liked
2754.69,or didn't like and how it felt.
2756.09,But this turns out all to
be,true for humans as well.
2759.87,We know that because McGaugh and Cahill
2762.18,did experiments where they gave people
2764.86,a boring paragraph to read
2767.05,and only a boring paragraph to read.
2769.4,But one group of subjects was asked
2772.35,to read the paragraph and
then,to place their arm
2775.03,"into very, very cold water."
2777.64,"In fact, it was ice water."
2779.19,We know that placing
one's,"arm into ice water,"
2781.59,especially if it's up to
the,"shoulder or near to it,"
2785.13,evokes the release of
adrenaline,in the body.
2787.54,"It's not an enormous release,"
2788.81,but it's a significant increase.
2790.41,"And yes, they measured adrenaline release."
2792.96,In some cases they also
measured,for things like
2794.63,"cortisol, etc."
2796.45,And what they found is that if one evokes
2800.29,the release of adrenaline through
2802.53,"this arm into ice water approach,"
2805.81,"the information that they read previously,"
2807.93,"just a few minutes before,"
2809.54,"was remembered, it was retained as well"
2813.47,as emotionally intense information.
2815.44,But keep in mind the
information,that they read
2817.1,was not interesting at all.
2818.15,"Or at least, it wasn't emotionally laden."
2821.02,This had to be the effect
of,adrenaline released
2823.85,"into the brain and body, because"
if,they blocked the release
2827.545,or the function of adrenaline in the brain
2832.0,"and or body, they could block this effect."
2834.67,Now the biology of
epinephrine,and cortisol
2838.125,"are a little bit complex,"
2838.958,but there's some nuance there
that's,actually interesting
2840.877,and important to us.
2842.07,"First of all, adrenaline is released"
2844.74,in the body and in the brain.
2846.03,It's released in the
body,from the adrenals.
2848.09,"Remember, epinephrine and"
adrenaline,are the same thing.
2851.09,Cortisol is also released
from,the adrenal glands.
2853.14,These two little glands
that,ride atop our kidneys.
2855.64,But it can't cross into the brain.
2857.5,It only has what we
call,peripheral effects.
2859.32,"Quickening of the heart rate, right?"
2861.99,Changes the patterns of blood flow.
2863.68,Changes our patterns of breathing.
2865.08,"In general, makes our breathing"
more,shallow and faster.
2867.83,In general makes our heart
beat,"more quickly, etc."
2871.42,Within our brain we
have,a little brain area
2873.3,"called locus coeruleus, which"
is,in the back of the brain.
2875.65,Which has the opportunity to sprinkler
2877.4,the rest of the brain with
2878.92,the neuromodulator
"epinephrine,","adrenaline,"
2881.39,"as well as norepinephrine,"
a,related neuromodulator.
2884.27,And to essentially wake up or
create,a state of alertness
2887.55,throughout the brain.
2888.63,So it's a very general effect.
2890.63,The reason we have two sites of release
2892.87,is because these neuro
chemicals,do not cross
2896.5,the blood-brain barrier.
2897.94,And so waking up the body with adrenaline
2900.55,"and waking up the brain are two separate,"
2902.41,so-called parallel phenomena.
2904.53,Cortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier
2907.24,because it's lipophilic.
2908.62,Meaning it can move through fatty tissue.
2911.68,And we'll get into the biology of that
2913.13,in another episode.
2914.29,But cortisol in general is released
2916.32,and has much longer term effects.
2917.96,"And as I just told you, can permeate"
2919.68,throughout the brain and body.
2920.75,Adrenaline has more local effects.
2922.41,Or at least is segregated
between,the brain and the body.
2925.26,This will turn out to be important later.
2927.33,The important thing to keep in mind
2929.431,is that it is the emotionality evoked
2931.03,"by an experience, or to be more precise,"
2934.595,it is the emotional state that you are in
2937.67,after you experience something
2940.98,that dictates whether
or,not you will learn it
2942.84,quickly or not.
2944.64,This is absolutely important
2946.595,in terms of thinking about tools
2948.4,to improve your memory.
2949.59,"And no, I am not going to suggest"
2951.36,that every time you
want,to learn something
2952.66,you plunge your arm into ice water.
2955.24,Why won't I suggest that?
2956.53,"Well, it will induce the"
release,"of adrenaline,"
2960.65,but there are better ways to
get,that adrenaline release.
2963.01,Before I explain exactly
what,"those tools are,"
2965.49,I want to tamp down on the biology
2967.61,of how all this works.
2968.61,Because in that understanding
you,will have access
2972.03,to the best possible tools
to,improve your memory.
2975.26,"First of all, McGaugh and Cahill"
2977.41,were excellent experimentalists.
2978.93,They did not just establish that you could
2982.25,quicken the formation of a memory
2984.74,by accessing material that
was,very emotionally laden
2988.05,"or creating an emotional,"
high,adrenaline state
2991.15,after interacting with some thing.
2994.35,"Some word, some person, some information."
2997.21,They also tested whether
or,not that whole effect
2999.75,could be blocked by
blocking,the emotional state
3003.08,or by blocking adrenaline.
3004.19,So what they did is they
had,people read paragraphs
3005.93,that either had a lot of emotional content
3009.03,or they had people read paragraphs
3010.8,"that were pretty boring, but then had them"
3013.05,put their arm into ice water.
3014.64,And I should say they
did,other experiments too
3016.36,to increase adrenaline.
3017.43,There were even some shock experiments
3018.73,that were done by other groups.
3020.28,Any number of things to evoke
3021.42,the release of adrenaline.
3022.253,Even people taking drugs
that,increase adrenaline.
3025.58,But then they also did what are
called,blocking experiments.
3029.06,They did experiments where they had people
3031.39,get into a highly emotional state
3033.33,"from reading highly emotional material,"
3035.67,or they got people to get
into,a highly emotional
3037.69,neuro chemical state by
reading,boring material
3039.89,and then taking a drug
to,"increase adrenaline,"
3042.53,"or an ice bath, or a shock."
3044.37,And then they also administered
a,drug called a beta blocker
3048.43,to block the affect of adrenaline
3050.89,and related chemicals
in,the brain and body.
3053.0,And what they found is that even
3055.72,if people were exposed to
something,really emotional
3058.97,or had a lot of adrenaline in their system
3062.24,because they received a drug to increase
3063.74,the amount of adrenaline.
3064.573,Two manipulations that
normally,"would increase memory,"
3066.66,keep that in mind.
3068.09,"If they gave them a beta blocker,"
3070.52,which reduced the response
to,"that adrenaline, right?"
3073.57,So no quickening of the heart rate.
3074.88,No quickening of the breathing.
3076.89,No increase in the
activity,of locus coeruleus
3080.1,and these kind of wake up
signals,to the rest of the brain.
3082.73,"Well then, the material wasn't"
remembered,better at all.
3086.04,"What this tells us is that, yes,"
3087.78,Francis Bacon was right.
3089.11,McGaugh and Cahill were right.
3090.58,"Hundreds, if not"
thousands,"of philosophers,"
3092.7,"and psychologists, and"
neuroscientists,were right.
3095.71,In stating and in thinking that
3099.24,high emotional states
help,you learn things.
3102.09,"But what McGaugh and Cahill really showed,"
3105.03,"and what's most important to know,"
3107.03,is that it is the presence
of,"high adrenaline,"
3111.87,high amounts of
norepinephrine,and epinephrine
3114.65,and perhaps cortisol as
"well,","as you'll soon see,"
3118.19,that allows a memory to
be,stamped down quickly.
3122.94,It is not the emotion.
3125.42,It is the neuro chemical
state,that you go into
3128.16,as a consequence of the emotion.
3130.51,And it's very important to understand
3131.76,"that while those two things are related,"
3133.44,they are not one and the same thing.
3135.79,Because what that means
is,that were you to evoke
3140.07,"the release of epinephrine,"
"norepinephrine,",and cortisol
3143.71,or even just one or two of those chemicals
3147.13,"after experiencing something,"
3149.23,you are stamping down the experience
3152.16,that you just previously had.
3153.6,Now this is fundamentally important
3156.14,and far and away different than the idea
3159.35,that we remember things because
they're,"important to us,"
3162.89,or because they evoke emotion.
3164.27,"That's true, but the real reason,"
3166.46,"the neuro chemical reason,"
the,mechanism behind all that
3169.6,is these neuro chemicals have the ability
3172.51,to strengthen neural connections
3174.77,by making them active just once.
3177.49,There's something truly magic about
3179.22,that neuro chemical cocktail that removes
3181.61,the need for repetition.
3183.23,"Okay, so let's apply this knowledge."
3184.74,Let's establish a scientifically
grounded,set of tools.
3188.29,Meaning tools that take into account
3190.93,the identity of the neuro chemicals
3193.07,that are important for enhancing learning
3195.56,and the timing of the
release,of those chemicals
3198.1,in order to enhance learning.
3200.27,When I first learned about the results
3201.74,"of McGaugh and Cahill,"
I,was just blown away.
3205.7,"I was also pretty upset,"
but,"not with them,"
3208.353,I was upset with myself.
3209.67,Because I realized that the way that I had
3211.21,been approaching learning
and,memory was not optimal.
3214.5,"In fact, it was probably"
in,the opposite direction
3217.83,to the enhanced protocol
for,learning and memory
3220.71,that I'm going to teach you today.
3223.11,My typical mode of
trying,to learn something
3224.97,"while I was in college, or"
while,"I was in graduate school,"
3228.01,"or as a junior professor,"
or,a tenured professor
3231.22,was to sit down to
whatever,it is I was going
3234.01,"to try and learn, and"
perhaps,even memorize.
3236.63,Or if it was a physical
"skill,",move to whatever
3239.09,environment I was going to
learn,"that physical skill in,"
3241.55,"and prior to that, to make sure that I was"
3245.06,"hydrated, because that's important to me."
3246.9,And certainly can
contribute,to your brain's
3249.43,ability to function and your
body's,ability to function.
3252.03,And general patterns of alertness.
3254.11,"But also, to caffeinate."
3256.14,"I would have a nice, strong"
cup,of coffee or espresso.
3259.44,I would have a nice
strong,cup of yerba mate.
3262.06,And I still drink coffee or
yerba,mate very regularly.
3267.04,"I drink them in moderation, I think."
3269.01,Certainly for me.
3270.38,But typically I would drink those things
3273.56,before I would engage
in,any kind of attempt
3276.26,to learn or memorize.
3277.63,Or to acquire a new skill.
3279.27,Now caffeine in the form
of,coffee or yerba mate
3283.18,or any other form of caffeine does create
3285.73,a sense of alertness in our brain and body
3287.42,and it does that through
two,major mechanisms.
3290.6,The first mechanism is by
blocking,the effects of adenosine.
3294.21,Adenosine is a molecule that builds up
3295.68,in the brain and body the
longer,that we are awake.
3297.78,And it's largely what's responsible
3299.63,for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue
3302.19,when we've been awake
for,a very long time.
3305.29,Caffeine essentially acts to block
3309.65,the effects of adenosine.
3310.67,"It's a competing agonist,"
not,"to get technical,"
3313.64,but it binds to the receptor for adenosine
3316.28,for some period of time
and,prevents adenosine
3318.17,from having its normal pattern of action.
3320.06,And thereby reduces our
feelings,of fatigue.
3323.84,But it also increases state of alertness.
3326.63,"So while it's reducing fatigue,"
3328.85,it's also pushing on
neuro,chemical systems
3331.05,in order to directly
increase,our alertness.
3332.77,And it does that in
large,part by increasing
3335.8,the transmission of
"epinephrine,","adrenaline,"
3338.53,in the brain and body.
3339.58,It also has this interesting
effect,of up regulating
3341.9,"the number and or efficiency,"
or,"we say the efficacy,"
3345.78,of dopamine receptors.
3348.24,"Such that when dopamine is present,"
3350.78,and is a molecule that
increases,"motivation,"
3352.71,"and craving, and pursuit, that dopamine"
3354.75,can have a more potent effect
than,it would otherwise.
3357.23,So caffeine really hits
these,three systems.
3359.29,"It hits other systems too,"
but,it mainly reduces fatigue
3362.01,"by reducing adenosine, increases alertness"
3364.84,"by increasing epinephrine release,"
3367.25,"or adrenaline release I should say,"
3368.61,both from the adrenals in your body
3370.18,and form locus coeruleus
from,within the brain.
3372.77,"And it can, in parallel"
to,"all that, increase"
3376.23,the action or the efficacy
of,the action of dopamine.
3380.19,So my typical way of
approaching,learning and memory
3382.82,would be to drink some caffeine
and,then focus really hard
3385.79,on whatever it is that
I'm,trying to learn.
3387.52,Try and eliminate distractions
3389.53,"and then hope, hope, hope."
3391.47,"Or try, try, try to"
remember,that information
3393.84,as best as I could.
3395.47,"And frankly, I felt like it"
was,working pretty well for me.
3397.71,"And typically, if I leveraged other forms"
3399.45,of pharmacology in order to
enhance,"learning and memory,"
3403.15,"things like Alpha GPC,"
or,"phosphatidyl serine,"
3407.46,I would do that by taking those things
3410.21,before I sat down to learn
3412.36,a particular set of information.
3414.05,Or before I went off to learn
a,particular physical skill.
3418.08,"Now, for those of you out"
there,listening to this
3420.3,"you're probably thinking, well, okay."
3423.16,The results of McGaugh and Cahill pointed
3425.41,to the fact that having
adrenaline,released after
3429.355,learning something enhanced
learning,of that thing.
3432.58,"But a lot of these things like caffeine,"
3434.65,or Alpha GPC can increase
epinephrine,and adrenaline
3438.69,or dopamine or other molecules
in,the brain and body
3443.173,that can enhance memory
for,a long period of time.
3445.75,"So it makes sense to take it first,"
3447.48,"or even during learning,"
3448.78,and then allow that increase to occur.
3451.05,And the increase will occur over
3452.143,a long period of time and will
enhance,learning and memory.
3455.31,"And while that is partially true,"
3458.1,it is not entirely true.
3459.58,And it turns out it's not optimal.
3461.84,Work that was done by
the,"McGaugh laboratory,"
3464.21,and in other laboratories evaluated
3467.44,the precise temporal relationship
3470.19,between neuro chemical
activation,of these pathways
3474.11,and learning and memory.
3475.32,What they did is they had
animals,"and or people,"
3477.57,"depending on the experiment, take a drug."
3480.02,It could be caffeine.
3481.54,It could be in pill form.
3483.66,Something that would increase adrenaline
3486.74,or related molecules that create
3488.91,this state of alertness that
are,related to emotionality.
3492.16,And they had them do it
either,"an hour before,"
3494.48,"30 minutes before, 10 minutes before,"
3497.37,"or five minutes before learning,"
3500.13,"or during the about of learning, right?"
3503.15,The reading of the
information,or the performing
3504.9,of the skill that one is trying to learn.
3506.26,"Or five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes,"
3508.87,"30 minutes, etc. afterwards."
3510.94,So they looked very
precisely,at when exactly
3513.58,is best to evoke this adrenaline release.
3516.0,And it turns out that the best time window
3518.3,"to evoke the release of these chemicals,"
3520.7,if the goal is to enhance
learning,and memory
3523.15,of the material is
either,immediately after
3526.7,"or just a few minutes,"
"five,","10, maybe 15 minutes"
3530.87,after you're repeating that information.
3533.96,You're trying to learn that information.
3535.42,"Again, this could be cognitive information"
3537.21,or this could be a physical skill.
3539.23,Now this really spits in the face
3541.38,of the way that most of us
approach,learning and memory.
3544.01,"Most of us, if we use"
stimulants,like caffeine
3548.27,"or Alpha GPC, we're taking those before"
3551.19,or during an attempt to
"learn,",not afterwards.
3555.5,These results point to the fact that
3557.81,it is after the learning and memory
3559.84,that you really want to
get,that big increase
3562.18,in epinephrine and the related molecules
3564.51,that will tamp down memory.
3565.92,So what this means is that
if,you are currently using
3568.57,"caffeine or other compounds,"
3570.57,and we'll talk about what those are
3571.87,and safety issues and
so,forth in a moment.
3575.53,If you're using those compounds in order
3577.15,to enhance learning and memory
3578.47,by taking them before or
during,"a learning episode,"
3582.6,well then I encourage you to try
3584.52,and take them either late
in,the learning episode
3587.38,or immediately after the learning episode.
3589.92,Now given everything I've
told,you up until now
3591.59,why would I say late
in,the learning episode
3593.49,or immediately after?
3594.61,"Well, when you ingest"
something,by drinking it
3597.19,"or you take it in capsule form,"
3598.74,there's a period of time before that gets
3600.19,absorbed into the body.
3601.09,"And different substances,"
3602.92,"such as caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc"
3605.21,are absorbed from the gut
and,into the blood stream
3608.07,and reach the brain and
trigger,these affects
3610.14,in the brain and body at different rates.
3611.65,So it's not instantaneous.
3613.34,"Some have effects within minutes,"
3614.9,others within tens of minutes and so on.
3618.35,It's really going to depend
3619.57,on the pharmacology of those things
3621.2,and it's also going to depend
3622.32,on whether or not you
have,"food in your gut,"
3623.76,what else you happen to have circulating
3625.2,"in your blood stream, etc."
3626.84,But at a very basic level
we,can confidently say
3629.5,"that there are not one, not dozens,"
3632.69,"but as I mentioned before,"
3633.73,hundreds of studies in
animals,and in humans
3635.92,that point to the fact that triggering
3637.24,the increase of adrenaline
late,in learning
3639.99,or immediately after learning
3641.33,is going to be most beneficial
3642.66,if your goal is to retain that information
3644.81,for some period of time.
3645.95,And to reduce the number of repetitions
3647.63,required in order to
learn,that information.
3649.98,"Now, I want to acknowledge that"
3651.27,on previous episodes of this podcast
3654.09,"and in appearing on other podcasts,"
3656.17,I've talked a lot about things
like,"non-sleep deep rest,"
3658.98,"and naps, and sleep as vital"
to,the learning process.
3661.98,And I want to emphasize
3663.01,that none of that information has changed.
3665.26,I don't look at any of that
information,differently
3667.36,as the consequence of what
I'm,talking about today.
3669.8,It is still true that the strengthening
3672.11,"of connections in the brain,"
3673.6,"the literal neural plasticity,"
3675.5,the changing of the circuits occurs
3677.06,during deep sleep and non-sleep deep rest.
3679.73,"And it is also true,"
3681.01,and I've mentioned these results earlier
3682.87,that two papers were
published,"in Cell Reports,"
3685.75,"Cell Press journal, excellent journal"
3687.52,over the last few years showing that
3690.05,brief naps of about 20 up to 90 minutes
3694.09,in some period of time
after,an attempt to learn
3697.47,can enhance the rate
of,learning and memory.
3701.4,"However, those bouts of sleep,"
3704.76,"the deep sleep that night, I should say,"
3706.36,"or those brief naps,"
3707.95,"or even the so-called NSDR as we call it,"
3710.52,non-sleep deep rest that was used
3712.24,to enhance the learning and memory
3714.83,of particular pieces of information.
3717.4,Either cognitive or physical
information,or both.
3721.0,"That still can be performed,"
3723.46,"but it can be performed some hours later,"
3727.18,even an hour later.
3728.47,It can be performed two hours
later,or four hours later.
3731.06,"Remember, it's in these"
naps,and in deep sleep
3733.41,that the actual reconfiguration
3734.93,"of the neural circuits occurs,"
3736.12,the strengthening of those
neural,circuits occurs.
3738.98,It is not the case that you need to finish
3741.17,a about of learning and drop
immediately,into a nap or sleep.
3743.56,"Some people might do that,"
3744.84,but if you're really trying to optimize
3746.68,"and enhance and improve your memory,"
3749.73,the data from McGaugh and Cahill
3751.09,and many other laboratories
that,stemmed out
3753.7,from their initial work really point
3755.58,to the fact that the
ideal,protocol would be
3759.34,focus on the thing you're
trying,to learn very intensely.
3761.66,There are also some other
things,"like error rates, etc."
3764.27,Please see our episodes on learning.
3765.83,We have a newsletter
on,how to learn better.
3768.36,You can access that at HubermanLab.com.
3769.607,It's a zero cost newsletter.
3771.76,You can grab that PDF.
3773.28,It lists out the things to
do,during the learning about.
3776.84,Still try and get excellent sleep.
3779.32,"Again, fundamentally"
important,"for mental health,"
3781.18,"physical health, and performance."
3782.62,And we can now extend from performance
3784.7,to saying including learning and memory.
3788.09,Nap if it doesn't interrupt
your,nighttime sleep.
3790.92,Naps of anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes.
3793.41,Or non-sleep deep rest protocols
3795.01,"will enhance learning and memory,"
3796.42,"but we can now add to that,"
that,spiking adrenaline
3800.78,"provided it can be done in a safe way,"
3802.84,is going to reduce the
number,of repetitions
3805.33,required to learn.
3806.163,And that should be done
at,the very tail end
3808.56,or immediately after a learning about.
3810.75,Which is compatible with all
3812.01,the other protocols that I mentioned.
3814.17,And the reason I'm revisiting this stuff
3815.7,about sleep and non-sleep deep rest
3817.57,is I think that some
people,got the impression
3819.07,that they need to do that
immediately,after learning
3821.12,and today I'm saying to the contrary.
3822.68,Immediately after learning
you,need to go into
3824.47,a heightened state of
emotionality,and alertness.
3827.45,Now it's vitally important to point out
3829.87,that you do not need pharmacology.
3832.6,You don't need caffeine.
3834.5,You don't need Alpha GPC.
3836.71,You don't need any pharmacologic substance
3838.86,to spike adrenaline
unless,that's something
3841.43,that you already are doing.
3843.34,Or that you can do safely.
3845.05,Or that you know you can do safely.
3846.72,"And I always say, and I'll say it again,"
3849.21,I'm not a physician so I'm
not,prescribing anything.
3851.16,"I'm a professor, so I profess things."
3853.24,You need to what's safe for you.
3854.84,So if you're somebody who's
not,used to drinking caffeine
3857.18,and you suddenly drink
four,espresso after trying
3859.56,"to learn something, you are going to have"
3861.64,a severe increase in alertness
and,probably even anxiety.
3866.79,"If you're panic attack prone,"
3868.3,please don't start taking stimulants
3870.29,in order to learn things better.
3871.76,Please be safe.
3872.593,"I don't just say that to protect me,"
3873.61,I say that to protect you.
3876.03,And I should mention that if you're
3877.68,"not accustomed to taking something,"
3879.55,you always want to first check
with,"your doctor, of course,"
3882.23,"but also move into that gradually, right?"
3884.75,Start with the lowest effective dose.
3887.499,The minimal effective dose.
3889.32,And sometimes the minimal effective dose
3891.99,"is zero milligrams, it's nothing."
3894.42,Why do I say that?
3895.253,"Well, we already talked"
about,results where
3898.09,they put people's arms into an ice bath
3901.3,in order to evoke adrenaline release.
3902.92,You are welcome to do that if you want.
3904.33,"In fact, that's a pretty"
low,"cost, zero pharmacology."
3907.67,At least exogenous pharmacology way
3909.32,to approach this whole thing.
3911.09,That's a way of evoking
your,own natural epinephrine
3913.773,that turns out also dopamine release.
3916.51,You could take a cold shower.
3918.24,You could do an ice bath or get into
3920.005,a cold circulating bath.
3921.92,We've done several episodes
3923.65,on the utility of cold for
health,and performance.
3925.83,You can find those episodes
at,HubermanLab.com.
3928.13,Also the episode with
my,colleague at Stanford
3930.83,"from the biology department,"
Dr.,Craig Heller.
3933.09,"Lots of protocols, in"
particular,in the episode
3935.98,on cold for health and performance.
3937.73,That describe how best to use
3940.54,the cold shower or the ice bath
or,the circulating cold bath
3944.65,in order to evoke epinephrine
3946.26,and dopamine release.
3948.32,The point is that the time in which
3950.64,you would want to do those protocols
3951.9,"is after, ideally immediately"
after,your learning about.
3956.31,Meaning when you're sitting down to learn
3957.84,new information or after trying
3959.12,to learn some new physical skill.
3961.32,Now whether or not that's compatible
3962.51,with the other reasons you're doing
3964.75,"deliberate cold exposure,"
3965.9,and whether or not that's compatible
3967.31,"with the other things you're doing,"
3968.36,that depends on the
contour,"of your lifestyle,"
3970.11,"your training, your academic goals,"
3971.48,"your learning goals, etc."
3972.87,But if your specific purpose is to enhance
3975.64,"learning and memory, you want"
to,spike adrenaline afterwards.
3977.727,And so what I'm telling
you,is you can do that
3979.34,with caffeine.
3980.66,You can do that with Alpha GPC.
3982.81,You can do that with a combination
3984.24,of caffeine and Alpha GPC.
3985.67,If you can do that safely.
3987.4,Some of you I know are using
3988.48,other forms of pharmacology.
3989.84,I did a long episode all about ADHD.
3993.043,I have to just really declare
my,stance very clearly
3995.72,"that I am not a fan, I am actually opposed"
3999.96,to people using prescription drugs
4002.25,who are not prescribed those drugs
4004.54,in order to enhance alertness.
4006.02,I think there's a big addictive potential.
4007.76,There also is a potential to really
4009.66,disrupt one's own pharmacology around
4011.53,the dopaminergic system.
4013.85,"However, some of you I know are prescribed"
4016.66,"things like ritalin,"
Adderall,and modafinil
4020.27,and things of that sort in order
4021.34,to increase alertness and focus.
4023.02,So for those of you that are prescribed
4024.36,those things from a board
certified,"physician,"
4027.7,you're going to have to decide
4028.66,if you're going to take
them,before trying to learn
4030.31,or after trying to learn.
4032.06,You also have to take into consideration
4033.42,that some of those drugs
are,very long acting.
4035.47,Some are shorter acting.
4037.13,And time that according
4038.4,to what you're trying to learn and when.
4040.23,So that's pharmacology.
4041.83,"But as I mentioned, there"
are,the behavioral protocols.
4044.83,You can use cold and cold
is,an excellent stimulus
4048.84,"because first of all, it"
doesn't,involve pharmacology.
4052.9,"Second of all, you can generally access it"
4055.71,"at low to zero cost, especially"
the,cold shower approach.
4059.38,"And third, you can titrate it."
4062.0,You can start with warmer water.
4063.73,"You can make it very, very"
cold,if that's your thing
4066.01,and you're able to tolerate that safely.
4067.54,You can make it moderately cold.
4070.83,How cold should it be in order
to,invoke adrenaline release?
4073.61,"Well, it should be uncomfortably cold"
4075.54,but cold enough that you feel like
4078.01,"you really want to get out,"
4079.01,but can stay in safely.
4080.37,That's going to evoke adrenaline release.
4082.59,"If it quickens your breathing,"
4084.16,if it makes you go wide eyed.
4086.09,That's increasing adrenaline release.
4087.57,"In fact, those effects of going wide eyed"
4089.85,and quickening of the breathing
4090.83,"and the challenges in thinking clearly,"
4092.75,those are the direct effects of adrenaline
4094.4,on your brain and body.
4095.75,"And of course, there are other ways"
4096.96,to increase adrenaline.
4098.19,You could go out for a hard run.
4100.76,You could do any number of things
4102.85,that would increase
adrenaline,in your body.
4105.12,"Which things you choose is up to you,"
4107.47,"but from a very clear, solid grounding"
4110.85,"in research data, we can confidently say"
4113.7,that spiking adrenaline after interacting
4116.7,"with some material, physical"
or,cognitive material
4118.95,"that you're trying to learn,"
4119.88,is going to be the best time
to,spike that adrenaline.
4122.42,Now I realize I'm being
a,bit redundant today
4124.28,or perhaps a lot redundant.
4126.22,In repeating over and over that
4128.77,the increase in epinephrine should occur
4131.44,either very late in an
attempt,to learn something
4134.32,or immediately after an
attempt,to learn something.
4138.22,I also want to emphasize
the,general contour
4140.98,of pharmacologic effects
and,of behavioral tools
4143.67,to create adrenaline.
4144.93,What do I mean by that sentence?
4146.3,What I mean is that McGaugh and colleagues
4149.3,explored a huge number
4150.47,of different compounds and approaches.
4151.77,Everything from the hand into the ice bath
4153.81,"to injecting adrenaline, to caffeine,"
4157.43,to drugs that block the affects
of,adrenaline and caffeine.
4162.36,Drugs like muscimol and picrotoxin.
4164.37,Please don't take those.
4165.203,These are drugs that reduce
4167.04,or enhance the amount of adrenaline
4168.6,and the overall takeaway is that anything
4171.68,that increases adrenaline will increase
4174.54,learning and memory and will reduce
4175.95,the number of repetitions
required,to learn something.
4179.2,Regardless of whether
or,not that something
4180.91,has an emotional intensity or not.
4184.82,Provided that spike in
adrenaline,occurs late
4188.11,in the learning or immediately after.
4189.63,And anything that reduces
epinephrine,and adrenaline
4193.76,will impair learning.
4195.78,And that's the key and
novel,piece of information
4198.59,that I'm adding now.
4199.63,Which is if you're taking
beta,"blockers, for instance."
4203.1,Or if you're trying to learn something
4205.59,and it's not evoking much
of,"an emotional response,"
4209.01,and you're not using any pharmacology
4210.79,or other methods to
enhance,adrenaline release
4213.67,"after learning that thing, well,"
4215.31,you're not going to learn it very well.
4217.13,"In fact, McGaugh and Cahill"
did,beautiful experiments
4220.6,in humans looking at how much adrenaline
4223.9,is increased by varying
the,emotional intensity
4228.67,of different things that they were trying
4229.87,to get people to learn.
4231.21,Or by changing the dosage of epinephrine.
4234.028,Or by changing the amount
of,epinephrine blocker
4236.54,that they injected.
4237.39,Lots and lots of studies.
4239.46,The key thing to take
away,from those studies
4241.2,"is that for some people, adrenaline"
4243.27,was increased 600 to 700%.
4246.32,So six to seven fold over baseline
4248.94,in the amount of circulating
epinephrine,or adrenaline.
4251.74,"And keep in mind, sometimes that increase"
4253.43,was due to the actual thing
they,were trying to learn
4255.54,"being very emotional,"
positive,or negative emotion.
4258.66,And sometimes it was
because,they were using
4260.31,a pharmacologic approach
or,the ice bath approach.
4262.95,I don't think they ever
used,"a cold shower approach,"
4264.61,but that would have been
a,very effective one
4266.24,we can be sure.
4267.42,"However, other people had"
a,zero to 10% increase.
4273.04,So a very small increase in epinephrine.
4276.27,What we can confidently say on the basis
4278.1,of all those data is that
the,"more epinephrine release,"
4282.173,the better that people
remembered,the material.
4285.86,Over and over again this was shown.
4287.24,Whether or not it was
for,"cognitive material,"
4289.09,"so learning a language,"
learning,"a passage of words,"
4291.79,learning mathematics.
4293.17,Or whether or not it was
for,physical learning.
4295.82,I want to emphasize something
about,physical learning
4297.73,because I know a number
of,you are probably
4300.05,drinking a cup of coffee or having
4301.6,a cup of yerba mate or
maybe,even an energy drink
4303.95,and taking some Alpha GPC or something
4305.68,before physical exercise.
4308.35,I'm not saying that's a bad thing to do
4309.86,or you wouldn't want to do that.
4311.05,But that's really to increase alertness.
4313.4,"It won't enhance learning,"
4314.7,at least not as well as
doing,those things after
4317.79,the physical exercise.
4319.11,"Now again, many of you, including myself,"
4321.65,exercise for the sake
of,the physical benefits
4323.63,of that exercise.
4324.463,"So cardiovascular, resistance training."
4326.54,But we're not really focused
on,learning and memory.
4329.9,"So, I emphasize this just so it's"
4333.2,immensely clear to everybody.
4335.285,If you want to use those approaches
4336.84,of increasing adrenaline prior to
4338.99,"or during physical training,"
4340.86,or cognitive work for
that,"matter, be my guest."
4343.59,"I think that's perfectly fine,"
4344.59,provided that's safe for you.
4346.33,It's only by moving it to late
4348.85,or after the learning that
you're,really shifting
4351.42,the role of that adrenaline increase
4354.1,to enhancing memory specifically.
4356.59,"And as a cautionary note, don't think"
4358.99,that you can push this entire system
4360.9,"to the extreme over and over again,"
4362.77,"or chronically, as we"
"say,",and get away with it.
4365.45,"In other words, you're"
not,going to be able
4367.95,to take a Alpha GPC and a double espresso
4371.795,"do your focus about of work,"
cognitive,"or physical work,"
4376.17,and then spike adrenaline again afterwards
4378.83,and remember that stuff
you,"did better, right."
4380.61,"I'm not encouraging you, in"
fact,I'm discouraging you
4383.68,from chronically increasing adrenaline
4387.01,both during and after
a,given about of work
4391.89,if the goal is to learn.
4393.48,Why do I say that?
4394.42,"Well, work from McGaugh"
and,Cahill and others
4397.63,has shown that it's
not,the absolute amount
4401.43,of adrenaline that you release
4403.34,in your brain and body that
matters,for enhancing memory.
4406.6,It's the amount of adrenaline you release
4409.73,relative to the amount of adrenaline
4412.27,that was in your system just prior.
4414.681,Particularly in the hour or two prior.
4416.37,"So again, it's the delta, as we say."
4417.89,It's the difference.
4418.97,So if you're going to
chronically,increase adrenaline
4421.23,you're not going to learn as well.
4423.2,The real key is to have
adrenaline,modestly low.
4425.89,Perhaps even just as much as you need
4428.16,"in order to be able to focus on something,"
4430.04,"pay attention to it, and"
then,spike it afterwards.
4432.9,This is immensely important because
4435.92,while much of what we're talking about
4438.26,is actually a form of inducing
4439.88,a neuro chemical acute stress.
4442.02,Meaning a brief and rapid onset of stress.
4446.33,"Well, chronic stress,"
the,chronic elevation
4450.01,of epinephrine and cortisol
4451.9,is actually detrimental to learning.
4453.66,And there's an entire
category,of literature
4456.54,mainly from the work of the great
4458.44,and sadly the late Bruce McEwen
4460.7,from the Rockefeller University.
4462.04,And some of his scientific offspring
4463.6,"like the great Robert Sapolsky,"
4465.7,"showing that chronic stress,"
4467.81,chronic elevation of epinephrine
4469.38,actually inhibits learning and memory.
4471.5,And also can inhibit
immune,system function.
4473.42,"Whereas acute, right, sharp increases"
4476.63,in adrenaline and cortisol
actually,can enhance learning
4480.03,"and indeed, can enhance the immune system."
4481.96,So if you really want to
leverage,"this information,"
4484.82,you might consider getting
your,brain and body
4487.61,into a very calm and yet alert state.
4490.82,So a high attentional state
4492.21,that will allow you to focus on what it is
4494.07,that you're trying to learn.
4495.24,We know focus is vital
for,encoding information
4498.35,and for triggering neuroplasticity.
4500.31,But remaining calm throughout that time
4503.02,and then afterwards spiking adrenaline
4505.9,and allowing adrenaline to
have,these incredible effects
4508.78,on reducing the number of repetitions
4510.5,required to learn.
4511.66,"So if you're like me, you're"
learning,about this information
4514.23,this beautiful work of
McGaugh,and Cahill and others
4516.69,"and thinking, wow, I"
should,perhaps consider
4519.77,spiking my adrenaline
in,one form or another
4523.1,at the tail end or immediately following
4525.36,an attempt to learn something.
4527.26,"And yet, we are not the first"
4529.04,to have this conversation.
4530.07,Nor were McGaugh and Cahill
4531.57,or any other researchers
that,I've discussed today
4535.19,the first to start using this technique.
4537.81,"In fact, there is a beautiful review"
4540.17,that was published just
this,"year, May of 2022"
4542.79,"in the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal."
4544.48,Excellent journal.
4546.01,Called Mechanisms of Memory Under Stress.
4549.01,And I just want to read to you
the,first opening paragraph
4552.17,"of this review, which"
"is,","as the name suggests,"
4554.43,all about memory and stress.
4556.81,"So here I'm reading, and I quote,"
4558.717,"""In Medieval times communities threw"""
4560.837,"""young children in the river when"""
4562.217,"""they wanted them to"
remember,"important events."""
4564.817,"""They believed that throwing"
a,"child in the water"""
4566.647,"""after witnessing historic proceedings"""
4568.927,"""would leave a life long memory"""
4570.277,"""for the events in the child."""
4572.57,"Believe it or not, this is true."
4574.44,This is a practice that
somehow,people arrived at.
4579.93,I don't know if they were
aware,of what adrenaline was.
4582.24,Probably not.
4583.41,But somehow in medieval times
4586.09,it was understood that spiking adrenaline
4588.91,or creating a robust emotional experience
4592.21,after an experience that one
hoped,a child would learn
4596.74,would encourage the
child's,"nervous system,"
4599.385,they didn't even know
what,"a nervous system was,"
4600.46,but would encourage the brain and body
4602.42,of that child to remember
those,particular events.
4606.86,Very counter intuitive if you ask me.
4608.93,I would have thought that
the,kid would remember
4610.7,only being thrown into the river.
4612.14,"My guess is that they remember that,"
4613.56,"but the idea here anyway,"
is,they also remember
4616.53,the things that preceded
being,thrown into the river.
4619.17,So both interesting and amusing
4622.59,"and somewhat, I should say"
thought,"stimulating, really."
4626.67,That this is a practice
that,has been going on
4629.67,for many hundreds of years.
4631.72,And we are not the first to start thinking
4634.18,about using cold water as
an,adrenaline stimulus.
4636.83,Nor are we the first
to,start thinking about
4638.36,using cold water induced adrenaline
4640.81,as a way to enhance learning and memory.
4642.62,This has been happening
since,medieval times.
4645.36,So up until now I've been talking about
4647.24,pretty broad contour of these experiments.
4649.93,I've been talking about the
underlying,"pharmacology,"
4652.0,the role of epinephrine and so forth.
4653.36,I haven't really talked a lot about
4654.77,the underlying neural mechanisms.
4656.3,So we're just going to
take,a minute or two
4658.125,and describe those for you
4659.234,because they are informative.
4660.84,We all have a brain structure
called,the amygdala.
4663.57,A lot of people think
it's,associated with fear
4665.61,but it's actually associated
with,threat detection
4668.86,"and more generally, and I"
should,"say more specifically,"
4672.17,with detecting what sorts of events
4674.98,in the environment are
novel,and are linked
4677.65,to particular emotional states.
4679.53,Both positive emotional states
4681.09,and negative emotional states.
4683.07,So the neurons in the
amygdala,are exquisitely good
4686.16,"at figuring out, right, they"
don't,have their own mind
4689.32,but at detecting correlations between
4692.25,sensory events in the environment
4693.82,that trigger the release of adrenaline
4695.66,and what's going on in the brain.
4697.25,And because the amygdala is so extensively
4699.3,interconnected with
other,areas of the brain.
4701.31,It basically connects to everything
4702.47,and everything connects back to it.
4705.11,The amygdala is in a
position,to strengthen
4707.99,particular connections
in,the brain very easily.
4712.97,Provided certain conditions are met.
4714.42,And those conditions are the ones
4715.4,we've been talking about up until now.
4717.46,Emotional saliency that
results,in increases
4719.64,in epinephrine and cortisol.
4721.45,Or circulating epinephrine and cortisol
4723.72,being much higher than it was 10 minutes
4725.63,or 15 minutes before.
4726.82,And the net effect of the amygdala
4728.49,in this context is to
take,whatever patterns
4731.19,of neural activity preceded that increase
4733.37,in adrenaline and corticosterone
4735.25,and strengthen those
synapses,that were involved
4737.93,in that neural activity.
4739.24,So the amygdala doesn't have knowledge.
4741.17,It's not a thinking area.
4743.07,It's a correlation detector.
4745.43,And it's correlating neural chemical
4746.9,"states of the brain and body,"
4748.24,different patterns of electrical
activity,in the brain.
4751.47,This is important because
it,really emphasizes
4754.84,the fact that both negative
and,positive emotional states
4759.37,and the different but somewhat overlapping
4763.58,"chemical states that they create,"
4765.49,"or the conditions, as we say the and gates"
4768.67,through which memory is laid down.
4770.79,And gates will be familiar to those
4772.3,of you who have done a bit
of,a computer programming.
4775.0,An and gate is simply a condition
4777.41,in which you need one
thing,and another to happen
4782.1,in order for a third thing to happen.
4784.44,So you need epinephrine
elevated,and you need
4787.24,robust activity in a
particular,brain circuit
4789.29,if in fact that brain circuit
is,going to be strengthened.
4792.57,It's not sufficient to have one
or,"the other, you need both."
4795.76,"Hence, the name and gate."
4797.28,And the amygdala is very
good,at establishing
4799.43,these and gate contingencies.
4801.51,It's also a very generic brain structure
4803.85,in the sense that it doesn't really care
4806.42,what sorts of sensory events are involved
4809.27,provided they correlated in time
4811.14,with that increase in
adrenal,and corticosterone.
4814.19,This has a wonderful side
and,a kind of dark side.
4817.84,The dark side is that PTSD and traumas
4822.33,of various kinds often involve an increase
4826.01,in adrenaline because whatever it was
4828.7,that caused the PTSD was
indeed,very stressful.
4831.09,Caused these big increases
in,these chemicals.
4833.18,And because the amygdala is
rather,general in its functions.
4837.7,"Right, it's not tuned or designed"
4839.81,in any kind of way to
be,specifically active
4842.31,in response to particular types
4844.4,"of sensory events, or perceptions."
4847.1,"Well, then what it means is that"
4848.6,we can start to become afraid
4850.56,of entire city blocks where
one,bad thing happened
4855.2,in a particular room of
a,particular building
4857.17,in a city block.
4858.27,We can become fearful of
anyplace,that contains
4861.7,a lot of people if
something,bad happened to us
4864.3,in a place that contained a lot of people.
4866.46,"The amygdala is not so much of a splitter,"
4869.4,as we say in science.
4870.43,We talk about lumpers and splitters.
4871.87,"Lumpers are kind of generalizers,"
4875.3,if that's even a word.
4876.42,"And I think it is, someone will tell me"
4878.189,one way or the other.
4879.615,And splitters are people
that,are ultra precise
4883.24,and specific and nuanced
about,every little detail.
4886.52,The amygdala is more of
a,lumper than a splitter
4889.6,when it comes to sensory events.
4891.6,Other areas of the
brain,only become active
4893.69,"under very, very specific conditions"
4895.63,and only those conditions.
4896.83,"And similarly, epinephrine"
is,just a molecule.
4900.79,It's just a chemical that's circulating
4903.54,in our brain and body.
4904.6,There's no epinephrine specifically for
4907.09,a cold shower that is
distinct,from the epinephrine
4910.12,associated with a bad event
4911.25,which is distinct from the epinephrine
4912.81,associated with a really exciting event
4914.4,that makes you really alert.
4915.38,Epinephrine is just a
"molecule,",it's generic.
4917.75,So these systems have a lot of overlap
4919.8,"and that can explain, in large part,"
4922.38,why when good things happen
in,particular locations
4925.61,"and in the company of particular people,"
4928.32,we often generalize to large categories
4931.65,"of people, places, and things."
4933.46,And when negative things happen
4935.08,"in particular circumstances,"
4936.18,we often generalize about
people,places and things
4939.14,associated with that negative event.
4940.91,So now I'd like to talk about other tools
4942.69,that you can leverage that have been shown
4944.52,"in quality, peer-reviewed studies"
4946.04,to enhance learning and memory.
4947.98,And perhaps one of the most potent
4949.74,of those tools is exercise.
4952.684,There are numerous studies on this
4955.35,in both animals and
fortunately,now also in humans.
4959.44,Thanks to the beautiful work
of,people like Wendy Suzuki
4962.26,from New York University.
4963.78,Wendy's lab has identified
how,exercise works
4967.09,to enhance learning and memory
4968.63,and other forms of
"cognition,",I should mention.
4971.28,"As well as things that can augment,"
4974.52,can enhance the effects of exercise
4976.85,on learning and memory and
other,forms of cognition.
4979.87,Wendy is going to be a
guest,on this podcast.
4981.84,It's actually the episode
that,follows this episode.
4985.02,And it includes a lot of material
4986.37,that we have not covered today.
4988.15,And she's an incredible scientist
4990.76,and has some incredible findings
4992.63,that I know everyone is going
to,find immensely useful.
4995.57,"In the meantime, I want to talk about some"
4997.77,of the general effects
of,exercise on learning
5000.017,and memory that she's discovered
5002.03,and that other laboratories
have,discovered.
5004.31,"If you recall earlier, I mentioned"
5005.69,that learning and memory
almost,always involves
5009.15,the strengthening of particular synapses
5012.08,and neural circuits in the brain.
5014.0,And not so much the increase in the number
5017.28,of neurons in the brain.
5019.21,"There is one exception, however."
5021.01,And we now have both animal
data,and some human data
5023.68,to support the fact that
cardiovascular,exercise
5026.54,seems to increase what we call
dentate,gyrus neurogenesis.
5031.23,Neurogenesis is the
creation,of new neurons.
5033.5,The dentate gyrus is a
subregion,of the hippocampus
5036.26,that's involved in learning and memory
5038.26,of particular kinds.
5039.61,"Right, certain types of events,"
5041.63,"particular contextual learning,"
5042.96,but some other things as well.
5044.9,Sometimes involved in spacial learning.
5046.7,There's a lot debate about exactly what
5048.29,"the dentate gyrus does, but for the sake"
5050.18,"of this discussion, and I think everyone"
5053.71,in the neuroscience community would agree
5055.03,that the dentate gyrus is important
5056.66,for memory formation and consolidation.
5061.07,The dentate gyrus does seem
to,"be one region in the brain,"
5064.3,"certainly in the rodent brain,"
5065.58,but more and more it's seeming
also,in the human brain
5069.13,where at least some new neurons
5071.31,are added throughout the lifespan.
5073.21,"And, as it turns out, that"
cardiovascular,exercise
5076.75,can increase the proliferation
5078.88,of new neurons in this structure.
5080.93,"And that those new neurons, excuse me,"
5084.08,are important for the formation
5086.58,of certain types of new memories.
5088.63,There are wonderful data showing that
5090.49,"if you use X-irradiation, which is a way"
5092.78,to eliminate the formation
of,those new cells
5095.25,or other tools and tricks to eliminate
5097.82,the formation of those cells
5099.18,that you block the
formation,of certain kinds
5101.59,of learning and memory.
5102.52,What does this mean?
5103.353,"Well, there are a lot of"
reasons,for the statement
5105.66,I'm about to make that extend far beyond
5108.61,neurogenesis and the
hippocampus,learning and memory.
5111.06,But it's very clear that getting anywhere
5112.92,"from 180, or I should say a minimum"
5115.62,of 180 to 200 minutes
of,so called zone two
5118.81,"cardiovascular exercise, so"
this,is cardiovascular exercise
5121.82,that can be performed
at,a pretty steady state
5125.52,which would allow you to just
barely,hold a conversation.
5128.14,So breathing hard but not super hard.
5131.05,Such as in sprints or high
intensity,interval training.
5133.36,But doing that for 180 to
200,minutes per week total
5137.05,is it appears the minimum threshold
5139.7,for enhancing some of
the,longevity effects
5143.19,associated with improvements
in,cardiovascular fitness
5146.3,"and we believe that it is indirectly,"
5149.01,"I should say indirectly,"
through,enhancements
5151.32,in cardiovascular fitness
that,there are improvements
5154.18,in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.
5156.95,What does that mean?
5157.99,The improvements in
cardiovascular,function
5160.6,are indirectly impacting the ability
5162.74,of the dentate gyrus to
create,these new neurons.
5165.2,To my knowledge there's
no,direct relationship
5167.97,between exercise and stimulating
5170.44,the production of new
neurons,in the brain.
5174.18,It seems that it's the
improvement,in blood flow
5177.3,that also relate to improvements
5178.96,"in things like lymphatic flow,"
5180.5,the circulation of lymph
fluid,within the brain
5182.89,that are enhancing neurogenesis
5184.94,"and that neurogenesis,"
it,appears is important.
5187.87,Now in fairness to the
landscape,of neuroscience
5191.11,and my colleagues at
Stanford,and elsewhere.
5194.08,There is a lot of debate
as,to whether or not
5196.37,there is much if any neurogenesis
in,the adult human brain.
5202.14,"But regardless, I think"
the,data are quite clear
5204.81,that the 180 to 200 minutes minimum
5207.934,of cardiovascular exercise
is,going to be important
5211.0,for other health metrics.
5212.6,Now it is clear that
exercise,can impact learning
5215.56,"and memory through other non-neurogenesis,"
5218.2,non-neuron type mechanisms.
5220.635,And one of the more exciting ones
5222.06,that has been studied over the years
5224.45,is this notion of hormones
from,bone traveling
5229.51,in the blood stream to the brain
5231.05,and enhancing the function
of,the hippocampus.
5234.392,If the words hormones from
bones,"is surprising to you,"
5237.55,"I'm here to tell you that yes, indeed,"
5239.59,your bones make hormones.
5242.19,We call these endocrine effects.
5244.03,So in biology we hear
about,"autocrine, paracrine,"
5248.34,and endocrine.
5249.4,Those different terms
refer,to over what distance
5252.78,a given chemical has an affect on a cell.
5255.66,"For instance, a cell can"
have,an affect on itself.
5258.17,It can have an affect on
immediately,neighboring cells
5260.64,"or it can have an affect on both itself,"
5263.44,immediately neighboring
cells,"and cells far,"
5265.48,far away in the body.
5267.325,And that last example of a given chemical
5270.28,or substance having and affect
on,the cell that produced it
5274.28,"plus neighboring cells,"
plus,cells far away
5276.42,is an endocrine effect.
5277.57,"And a lot of hormones, not"
"all,",work in this fashion.
5281.38,Hence why we sometimes hear
about,endocrine and hormone
5284.65,as kind of synonymous terms.
5287.27,Your bones make chemicals that
travel,in the blood stream
5290.94,and have these endocrine effects.
5292.26,So they're effectively acting as hormones.
5294.03,And one such chemical is
something,called osteocalcin.
5297.31,Now these findings arrived
to,us through various labs
5299.61,but one of the more important labs
5300.91,for the sake of this discussion today
5302.71,is the laboratory of Eric Kandel
at,Columbia Medical School.
5306.51,"Eric is now, I believe"
in,"his mid to late 90s,"
5309.18,still very sharp.
5310.34,And has studied learning and memory.
5312.22,It also turns out that
he,is an avid swimmer.
5314.89,"Now, I happen to know"
that,Eric swims anywhere
5317.58,from a half a mile to a mile a day.
5320.0,"And again, this is anecdotal."
5322.91,I'm not referring to the
published,data just yet.
5324.75,But he credits that
exercise,as one of the ways
5328.31,in which he keeps his brain sharp
5330.16,and has indeed kept his brain sharp
5332.41,"for many, many decades."
5334.22,"And as I mentioned before,"
he's,well into his 90s.
5336.01,So pretty impressive.
5337.41,His laboratory has studied the effects
5339.38,of exercise on hippocampal
function,and memory.
5342.8,And other laboratories
have,done that as well.
5345.27,And what they've found is
that,cardiovascular exercise
5348.49,"and perhaps other forms of exercise too,"
5350.23,but mainly cardiovascular exercise creates
5353.2,the release of osteocalcin from the bones
5356.06,that travels to the
brain,and to sub regions
5358.64,of the hippocampus and encourages
5361.27,the electrical activity and
formation,and maintenance
5365.22,of connections within the hippocampus
5367.46,and keeps the hippocampus functioning well
5369.35,in order to lay down new memories.
5371.48,Now osteocalcin has a lot of effects
5373.52,besides just improving the
function,of the hippocampus.
5376.37,Osteocalcin is involved
in,bone growth itself.
5379.4,It's involved in hormone regulation.
5381.31,"In fact, there's really nice evidence"
5382.95,that it can regulate testosterone
and,estrogen production
5386.02,by the testes and ovaries.
5387.53,And a bunch of other effects
in,other organs of the body.
5389.91,"Because again, it's acting"
in,this endocrine manner.
5392.14,It's arriving from bone to a lot
5394.9,of different organs to have effects.
5397.57,"Load bearing exercise, in particular,"
5399.89,turns out to be important for inducing
5402.33,the release of osteocalcin.
5403.76,And when you think about
"this,",it makes sense.
5406.85,A nervous system exists
for,"a lot of reasons,"
5408.97,"to sense, perceive, etc."
5410.27,"You've got taste, you've got smell,"
5411.2,you've got hearing.
5412.19,But the vast majority
of,"brain real estate,"
5415.12,"especially in humans, is"
dedicated,to two things.
5418.1,"One, vision."
5419.89,We have an enormous amount
5421.05,of brain real estate devoted to vision.
5423.38,Certainly compared to other senses.
5425.61,And to movement.
5427.07,The ability to generate
course,movements of the body.
5430.14,"The ability, excuse me,"
to,generate fine movements
5432.52,"of the body, like the digits,"
5433.62,"or to wink one eye, or to tilt your head"
5435.64,"in a particular way, or move your lips"
5437.38,and move your face and do
all,sorts of different things
5439.11,in a very nuanced and detailed way.
5442.12,So much of our brain real estate
5443.47,is devoted to movement
that,it's been hypothesized
5447.07,"for more than a half century,"
5449.47,but especially in recent years
5451.15,as we've learned more about the function
5452.34,of the brain in a really
detailed,"circuit level,"
5455.729,that the relationship
between,the brain and body
5458.07,and the maintenance and perhaps even
5460.86,the improvement of the
neural,circuitry in the brain
5462.93,depends on our body
movements,and the signal
5465.66,from the body that our
brain,is still moving.
5468.49,So think about that.
5469.323,How would your brain know if your body
5470.82,was moving regularly and how would it know
5472.65,how much it was moving?
5473.63,How would it know which
limbs,it was moving?
5475.97,"Well, you could say, if the heart rate"
5478.15,is increased then the blood
flow,will be increased
5480.23,and then the brain will know.
5481.97,"Ah, but how does your brain know"
5484.63,that its increased blood
flow,due to movement
5487.31,"and not to, for instance,"
just,"stress, right?"
5490.03,Maybe you actually can't move
5491.13,and you're very stressed about that
5492.33,and so the increased blood flow
5493.82,is simply a consequence
of,increased stress.
5498.82,The fact that osteocalcin
is,released from bone
5502.93,and in particular can be released
5504.75,in response to load bearing exercise.
5506.93,"So this would be running,"
again,weightlifting
5509.24,"hasn't been tested directly,"
5510.51,but one would imagine
anything,that involves
5512.64,"jumping and landing, or weightlifting,"
5515.127,or body weight movements
and,things of that sort.
5519.34,"That's a signal to release osteocalcin,"
5521.87,and we know that signal occurs.
5524.0,That is directly reflective
5527.32,of the fact that the body was moving
5529.92,and moving in particular ways.
5531.23,"In fact, you could imagine that big bones"
5533.87,like your femur are going
to,release more osteocalcin
5536.28,or be in a position to
release,more osteocalcin
5538.33,then fine movements like
the,movements of the digits.
5541.32,And this idea that the body is constantly
5544.01,signaling to the brain about the status
5546.22,of the body and the
varying,needs of the brain
5549.13,"to update its brain circuitry,"
5551.41,is a really attractive
idea,that fits entirely
5554.89,"with the biology of exercise, osteocalcin,"
5557.91,and hippocampal function.
5559.57,I do want to mention that I'm not
5562.09,the first to raise this hypothesis.
5563.79,This hypothesis actually was discussed
5565.7,in a fair amount of detail by John Ratey
5568.1,who's a professor at
Harvard,Medical School.
5570.33,"He wrote a book called, ""Spark"""
5571.75,which was one of the early books
5574.544,at least from an academic
about,brain plasticity
5576.007,and the relationship between exercise
5577.68,and movement and plasticity.
5578.97,"And John, who I have the"
good,"fortune to know,"
5581.99,"has described to me experiments,"
5583.9,or I should say observations of species
5586.81,"of ocean dwelling animals that have,"
5589.44,"at least for the early part of their life,"
5591.1,a very robust and
complicated,nervous system.
5594.21,But then these particular animals
5596.69,are in the habit of
plopping,down unto a rock.
5599.43,"They find kind of a safe, comfy space"
5601.77,and they actually stick to that rock
5604.04,and they don't move anymore
for,"a certain portion,"
5607.0,I should say the later
portion,of their life.
5609.14,And it is at the transition
between,moving a lot
5611.65,and being stationary that those animals
5613.58,actually digest their own brain.
5616.437,The literally metabolize a good portion
5618.96,of their nervous system
because,"they decide, oh,"
5621.05,don't need this anymore.
5622.24,"And gobble it up, use it"
for,its nutritional value
5626.32,and then sit there like a
moron,version of themselves
5630.66,with a limited amount of brain tissue
5633.576,because they don't need to move anymore.
5635.46,"Now, I certainly don't"
want,to give the message
5637.16,"that just moving, just exercise,"
5639.25,is sufficient to keep
the,neural architecture
5641.51,"of your brain healthy,"
"young,",and able to learn.
5644.69,"While that might be true,"
5646.43,it's also important to actually engage
5648.21,in attempts to learn new material.
5650.26,"Either physical material,"
so,new types of movements
5653.55,and skills and or new types
of,cognitive information.
5657.02,"Languages, mathematics,"
"history,",current events.
5660.72,All sorts of things
that,involve your brain.
5663.76,"Nonetheless, it's clear"
that,physical movement
5666.82,and cognitive ability and the potential
5669.47,to enhance cognitive ability
5671.39,and the ability to learn
new,physical skills
5673.31,are intimately connected.
5674.99,And osteocalcin appears
to,be at least one way
5678.43,in which that brain-body relationship
5680.09,is established and maintained.
5681.72,So given the information about
osteocalcin,"and movement,"
5685.17,and given the information
about,spiking adrenaline late
5689.01,"or after a period of an attempt to learn,"
5692.33,you might be asking when is
the,best time to exercise?
5695.15,"Now unfortunately, that"
has,not been addressed
5698.06,"in a lot of varying detail,"
5699.84,where every sort of variation on the theme
5702.78,has been carried out.
5703.71,"And yet, Wendy Suzuki's lab has done"
5705.76,really beautiful experiments where
5708.07,"they have people exercise,"
generally,it was in the morning.
5711.89,But at other periods of the day as well.
5714.66,And what they find is
that,at least as late as
5717.9,"two hours after that exercise,"
5720.73,there is an enhancement
in,learning and memory.
5723.27,"Now I want to be clear, we don't know"
5725.24,whether or not that exercise led
5727.14,to big increases in adrenaline.
5729.62,It may be that those forms of exercise
5732.21,"were modest enough, or didn't"
challenge,people enough
5735.54,that they merely got a
lot,of blood flow going
5737.62,and that the improvements in learning
5738.547,and memory were related to blood flow
5740.42,and we presume increases in osteocalcin.
5743.96,"However, you could imagine a couple"
5745.65,of different logical protocols based
5748.38,on what we've talked about.
5750.1,Let's say you were going
to,do a form of exercise
5751.92,that was going to spike adrenaline a lot.
5753.59,So this would be exercise
that,really challenges
5756.45,your system and forces you to kind
5757.55,of push through a burn.
5759.0,"Right, so here I'm mainly thinking about"
5760.86,cardiovascular exercise.
5762.01,"But it could even be yoga,"
5764.8,it could be resistance training.
5767.24,If it's going to give you a big spike
5769.01,"in adrenaline, it's going"
to,"take some serious effort,"
5772.41,then logically speaking you
would,want to place that
5776.14,after a learning about
in,order to increase
5778.48,learning and memory.
5779.313,"However, if you're using the exercise"
5781.78,in order to enhance blood flow
5783.52,and to enhance osteocalcin release.
5786.14,In efforts to augment the
function,"of your hippocampus,"
5788.81,I think it stands to reason that doing
5790.52,that exercise sometime within
5793.25,the hour to three hours
preceding,an attempt to learn
5796.92,makes a lot of sense.
5797.92,And there I'm basing it on the human data
5799.53,from Wendy Suzuki's lab.
5801.11,I'm basing it on the
studies,from Eric Kandel
5803.4,and from others labs.
5805.37,"Again, right now, there hasn't been"
5807.22,an evaluation of a lot
of,different protocols
5809.36,to arrive at the peer-reviewed
laboratory,super protocol.
5813.54,"However, since what we're talking about"
5815.68,is using activities
like,exercise that most
5818.06,"of us probably, perhaps all of us,"
5820.55,should be doing regularly anyway.
5822.54,And I do believe most
if,not all of us should
5825.33,regularly be trying to learn
5826.48,and keep our brain functioning well
5828.24,and acquire new knowledge.
5829.073,Because it's just a
wonderful,part of life.
5830.78,And there is evidence
that,actually can keep
5832.6,"your brain young, so to speak."
5834.65,"Well then, exercising either before"
5838.34,or after a learning about
makes,a lot of sense.
5841.59,With the emphasis on
after,a learning about
5844.22,if the form of exercise
spikes,a lot of adrenaline
5846.51,for all the reasons we
talked,about before.
5848.47,"Okay, so we've talked about two major"
5850.11,categories of protocols to improve memory
5852.24,"that are grounded in quality,"
peer,reviewed science.
5855.27,And there is yet another third protocol
5857.78,that we'll talk about in a few minutes.
5859.49,"But before we do that,"
5861.141,I want to briefly touch
on,"an aspect of memory,"
5863.38,"in fact, two aspects of memory"
5864.81,that I get a lot of questions about.
5867.01,The first one is photographic memory.
5870.83,"To be clear, there are people out there"
5872.96,who have a true photographic memory.
5874.8,"They can look at a page of text,"
5876.63,"they can scan it with their eyes,"
5877.88,and they can essentially
commit,that to memory
5880.8,with very little if any effort.
5883.23,While it might seem that
having,a photographic memory
5884.97,"is a very attractive skill to have,"
5886.46,I should caution you
against,believing that
5889.07,because it turns out that people
5890.74,with true photographic memory
are,often very challenged
5893.3,at remembering things that they hear.
5895.6,And often times are not so good
5897.43,at learning physical skills.
5898.82,"It's not always the case,"
but,often that's the case.
5901.03,So be careful what you wish for.
5902.75,If you do have a photographic memory
5904.45,there are certain professions
that,lend themselves
5906.62,particularly well to you.
5909.68,And indeed a lot of people
with,photographic memory
5911.81,have to find a profession
and,have to move through life
5914.97,in a way that is in concert
5917.73,with that photographic memory.
5918.89,"So again, it's a super ability,"
5921.27,it's a hyper ability and
yet,it's not necessarily one
5923.96,that is desirable for most people.
5926.38,There's also this category
of,what are called
5927.83,super recognizers.
5929.49,"These people are, I should mention,"
5931.05,highly employable by government agencies.
5933.37,These are people that have
an,absolutely astonishing
5937.95,ability to recognize faces and
to,match faces to templates.
5942.01,They can look at a photograph
5944.25,of say somebody on a most wanted list
5947.38,and then they can look at video footage
5950.73,"of let's say an airport, or a mall,"
5952.64,or a city street at fairly low resolution
5955.29,and they can spot the person who's face
5957.92,matches that photograph
that,they looked at.
5960.4,Even if that video or other footage
5964.16,is of people's profiles or even
5967.23,the tops of their heads and just
5968.49,a portion of their forehead.
5969.43,These people have just
an,incredible ability
5972.2,to recognize faces and to template match.
5974.47,"And again, these people often will take"
5976.61,jobs with agencies where this
sort,of thing is important.
5979.79,Some of you out there probably
5981.49,are super recognizers and
may,or may not notice it.
5984.18,If you've ever had the experience
5985.32,of watching a movie and
thought,"to yourself,"
5987.65,"wow, her mouth looks so"
much,like my cousin's mouth.
5992.42,Or you look at a character in a movie
5994.76,"or a television show and you think,"
5997.35,"wow, they look almost like the"
younger,sister of so and so.
6001.72,"Well, then it's very"
likely,"that you have this,"
6005.95,or at least a mild form of
this,super recognizer ability.
6009.11,That is not memory per se.
6011.69,That is the hyper functioning of an area
6014.02,of the brain that we
call,the fusiform gyrus.
6017.0,The fusiform gyrus is literally
6018.6,"a face recognition area, and"
a,face template matching area.
6022.92,And it harbors neurons that
respond,to faces generally.
6025.88,"So as humans and other non-human primates,"
6028.53,we care a lot about faces
and,their emotional content.
6031.73,And the identity of faces
is,super important to us
6035.06,for all the kinds of reasons
that,are probably obvious.
6038.24,"Knowing who's friend, who's foe."
6040.05,Who do you know well?
6040.94,"Who's famous, who's not famous?"
6043.09,Etc.
6043.923,"That is not memory, per se."
6045.74,"And yet, if you're a super recognizer,"
6048.14,or I guess you could call it
a,moderate face recognizer
6051.94,or not very good at recognizing faces
6054.12,"because indeed, there are some people"
6055.23,that are kind of face blind.
6056.94,They don't actually recognize people
6059.09,when they walk in the room.
6059.923,I used to work with somebody like this.
6061.08,"I'd walk into his office and he'd say,"
6062.79,are you Rich or are you Andrew?
6065.01,"And I would say, well am I rich, rich."
6067.1,"Like, you know, wealth rich?"
6068.25,No.
6069.083,"And he'd say, no, are you"
Richard,or are you Andrew?
6071.61,"And I'd say, I'm Andrew."
6072.77,We know each other really well.
6074.135,"And he'd say, oh I'm sorry."
6075.07,I'm kind of face blind.
6076.13,And it actually tended
to,be better or worse
6078.448,depending on how much he was working.
6081.24,"Ironically, the more rested he was"
6084.11,the more face blind he would become.
6085.57,So it wasn't a sleep deprivation thing.
6087.21,"That exists, that's out there."
6088.31,There's the full constellation
6090.22,of people's ability to recognize faces.
6092.29,That's not really memory.
6093.42,"And yet, visual function is"
a,profoundly powerful way
6097.71,in which we can enhance our memories.
6099.19,So whether or not you're a
super,"recognizer of faces,"
6101.83,whether or not you are face blind
6103.58,or anything in between.
6105.2,Next I'm going to tell you about a study
6107.44,which points out the immense
value,of visual images
6112.19,for laying down memories.
6114.17,And you can leverage this information
6116.15,and this involves both
the,"taking of photographs,"
6118.34,something that's quite easily
6120.14,done these days with your phone.
6121.61,As well as your ability
to,take mental photographs
6124.27,by literally snapping your eyelids shut.
6126.74,So I just briefly want
to,describe this paper
6128.47,because it provides a
tool,that you can leverage
6130.82,in your attempt to learn
and,remember things better.
6134.15,The title of this paper
is,"Photographic Memory,"
6137.01,the Effects of our Volitional Photo-Taking
6139.17,on Memory for Visual and Auditory
Aspects,of an Experience.
6143.73,I really like this paper because it refers
6146.63,to photographic memory not in the context
6148.76,of photographic memory
that,we normally hear about
6151.15,"where people are truly photographic,"
6152.79,look at a page and somehow
absorb,all that information
6155.63,and commit it to memory.
6156.72,But rather the use of camera photographs
6159.65,or the use of mental camera photographs.
6162.88,Literally looking at
something,"deciding, blink,"
6165.62,"snapping a, so to speak,"
snapping,a snapshot
6169.42,of whatever it is that you are looking at
6170.93,and remembering the content.
6172.47,The reason I like this paper
6173.67,and the reason I'm attracted to this issue
6175.55,of mental snapshots is this is something
6177.29,that I've been doing since I was a kid.
6178.41,"I don't know why I started doing it,"
6179.67,"but every once in a while, I"
would,say maybe twice a year
6183.47,I would look at something
and,decide to just
6185.47,snap a mental snapshot of it.
6187.46,And I've maintained very clear memories
6189.15,of those visual scenes.
6190.6,Two years ago I was in an Uber
6193.19,and I looked out the window
6194.85,and it was a street scene.
6195.683,I was actually in New York at the time
6197.37,and I decided for reasons
that,"are still unclear to me,"
6201.16,to take a mental snapshot
of,this city street image.
6203.44,Even though nothing interesting
in,particular was happening.
6206.36,And I do recall that
there,was a guy wearing
6209.14,"a yellow shirt walking, there"
was,"some construction, etc."
6211.48,I can still see that
image,in my mind's eye
6213.74,because I took this mental snapshot.
6215.6,This paper addresses whether or not
6216.85,this mental snapshotting thing is real
6218.82,and this is something I think a lot
6221.03,"of people will resonate with,"
6223.02,whether or not the constant taking
6224.81,of pictures on our phones
or,with other devices
6226.944,is either improving or
degrading,our memory.
6230.17,You could imagine an argument for both.
6232.6,A lot of people are taking pictures
6233.85,that they never look at again.
6235.72,"And so in a sense, they're outsourcing"
6237.88,their visual memory of
events,into their phone
6241.83,or some other device and they're not ever
6244.38,accessing the actual image again.
6246.2,"They're not looking at it, right?"
6247.32,You're not printing out those photos.
6248.7,You're not scanning
through,your phone again.
6250.11,"Sometimes you might do that,"
6251.01,but most of the time people don't.
6252.1,Most of the photographs people are taking
6253.56,they're not revisiting again.
6255.03,So the motivation for this study was that
6256.83,previous experiments had shown that
6260.6,if people take photos of a scene
6262.61,"or a person, or an object, that"
they,are actually less good
6266.54,at remembering the details of that scene
6269.81,"or object, etc."
6272.21,This study challenged that idea
6274.43,and raised the hypothesis that
6277.14,if people are allowed to choose what
6279.21,"they take photos of, that taking photos,"
6282.18,"again, this is with the camera,"
not,mental snapshotting.
6284.29,That taking those photos would actually
6285.82,"enhance their memory for those objects,"
6288.56,"those places, those people, and in fact,"
6290.55,"details of those objects,"
"places,",and people.
6293.15,"And indeed, that's what they found."
6294.95,So in contrast to previous studies
6296.99,"where people had been more or less told,"
6299.55,"take photos of these following objects,"
6301.42,"or these following people,"
or,these following places
6303.74,and then they were given a memory test
6306.47,at some point later.
6307.52,In this study people were given
volitional,"control, right?"
6311.3,They were given agency in making
6313.27,the decision of what to take photos of.
6315.05,And I'll just summarize the results.
6316.27,We'll provide a link to this study.
6317.54,I should say that some of the stuff
6319.27,that they tested was
actually,pretty challenging.
6321.56,Some of them were pottery and other forms
6323.97,of ceramics that are of
the,sort that you see
6326.64,if you go to a big museum in a big city.
6328.61,"And if you've ever done that,"
6329.443,"and you see all the different objects,"
6331.16,there are a lot of
details,in those objects
6332.64,and a lot of those
objects,look a lot alike.
6335.35,And so someone will have two handles.
6337.71,Some will have one handle.
6338.61,The position of the handles.
6339.7,How broad or narrow these things are.
6342.53,"You know, a lot of this"
is,pretty detailed stuff.
6344.51,They also took photos of other things.
6347.32,So basically what they found was that
6349.94,if people take pictures of things
6350.9,and they choose which things
6352.22,"they are taking pictures of, right."
6353.77,"It's up to them, it's volitional."
6355.28,That there's enhanced memory
for,those objects later on.
6361.87,"However, it degraded their ability"
6364.43,to remember auditory information.
6365.793,So what this means is that when we take
6367.44,"a picture of something, or a person,"
6371.09,we are stamping down a
visual,memory of that thing.
6374.65,"And that makes sense, it's"
a,photograph after all.
6376.88,But we are actually inhibiting our ability
6379.1,"to remember the auditory,"
the,sound component
6382.53,of that visual scene or
what,the person was saying.
6384.61,Very interesting.
6385.5,And points to the fact
that,the visual system
6387.66,"can out compete the auditory system,"
6389.18,at least in terms of how the hippocampus
6391.02,is encoding this information.
6392.77,The other finding I find
particularly,interesting
6394.75,within this study is that it didn't matter
6398.47,whether or not they ever
looked,at the photos again.
6400.56,"So they actually had people take photos,"
6402.95,or not take photos of different objects.
6405.64,They had some people keep their photos
6407.17,and they had other
people,delete the photos.
6409.4,And it turns out that whether or not
6411.724,people kept the photos
or,deleted those photos
6413.23,had no bearing on whether or not
6414.52,they were better or worse
at,remembering things.
6417.23,They were always better
at,remembering them
6419.45,as compared to not taking photos of them.
6421.05,What does this mean?
6421.89,It means that if you really
want,to remember something
6423.63,"or somebody, take a photo"
of,that thing or person.
6427.64,Pay attention while you take the photo.
6430.14,But it doesn't really matter if you look
6431.28,at the photo again.
6433.049,"Somehow the process of taking that photo,"
6435.61,probably looking at it.
6437.415,"You know, in a camera typically we'd say"
6439.03,through the viewfinder or now
because,of digital cameras
6441.32,"on the screen on the back of that camera,"
6443.65,"or on your phone, that"
framing,up of the photograph
6447.07,stamps down a visual image in your mind
6449.06,that is more robust at serving a memory
6452.04,then had you just looked at that thing
6453.48,with your own eyes.
6455.02,Very interesting and it raises all sorts
6456.71,of questions for me about whether or not
6458.83,it's because you're
framing,up a small aperture
6461.02,or a small portion of the visual scene.
6462.87,"That's one logical interpretation,"
6464.47,although they didn't test that.
6465.95,I should also say that they found
6467.73,that whether or not that you looked
6468.66,"at a photo that you took,"
6470.61,or whether or not you deleted it
6471.91,"and never looked at it again,"
6473.75,didn't just enhance visual memory
6475.79,or the memory from the visual
components,of that image
6479.03,but it always reduced your ability
6481.73,to remember sounds associated
with,that experience.
6484.82,So that's interesting.
6486.33,"And then last but not least,"
6488.15,and perhaps most
"interesting,","at least to me,"
6490.44,was the fact that you didn't even need
6492.45,a camera to see this effect.
6494.61,If subjects looked at something
6496.53,and took a mental
photograph,"of that thing,"
6499.37,it enhanced their visual
memory,of that thing
6502.684,significantly more than had they not taken
6505.3,a mental picture.
6506.64,"In fact, it increased"
their,memory of that thing
6510.32,almost as much as taking
an,actual photograph
6512.81,with an actual camera.
6514.4,And the reason I find this so interesting
6516.38,is that a lot of what we
try,and learn is visual.
6520.53,"And for a lot of people,"
6521.94,the ability to learn visual information
6524.67,feels challenging.
6525.95,And we'll look at something and we'll try
6527.49,and create some detailed
understanding,of it.
6529.92,We'll try and understand the relationships
6531.29,between things in that scene.
6533.41,It does appear based on this study
6534.98,that the mere decision to
take,"a mental snapshot,"
6538.44,"like, okay I'm going to blink my eyelids"
6539.92,and I'm going to take a snapshot
of,"whatever it is I see,"
6541.74,can actually stamp down a visual memory
6544.28,much in the same way that
a,camera can stamp down
6547.05,a visual memory.
6547.883,"Of course, through vastly"
distinct,mechanisms.
6550.71,No discussion of memory would be complete
6553.24,without a discussion of the
ever,intriguing phenomenon
6557.16,known as deja vu.
6559.3,This is a sense that we've
experienced,something before
6561.79,but we can't quite put our finger on it.
6563.53,Where and when did it happen?
6565.03,Or the sense that we've
been,someplace before.
6567.29,Or that we are in a
familiar,state or place
6571.047,or context of some kind.
6573.64,"Now, I've talked about"
this,"on the podcast before,"
6576.42,"at least, I think I have."
6577.88,And the way this works has been defined
6581.04,largely by the wonderful
work,of Susumu Tonegawa
6584.11,at Massachusetts Institute
of,"Technology, MIT."
6587.38,Susumu collected a Nobel
"Prize,","quite appropriately,"
6590.69,for his beautiful work on immunology.
6592.97,And he's also a highly
accomplished,neuroscientist
6595.68,who studies memory and
learning,and deja vu.
6598.88,And I should also mention
the,beautiful work
6601.08,of Mark Mayford at the Scripps Institute
6602.85,and UC San Diego.
6604.64,Beautiful work on this notion of deja vu.
6606.73,Here's what they discovered.
6608.76,They evaluated the
patterns,of neural firing
6611.26,in the hippocampus as
subjects,learn new things.
6615.64,"Okay, so neuron A fires,"
then,"neuron B fires,"
6620.05,then neuron C fires in
a,particular sequence.
6622.87,"Again, the firing of neurons"
in,a particular sequence
6625.83,like the playing of keys on a piano
6627.53,in a particular sequence leads
6628.7,to a particular song on the piano
6630.05,and leads to a particular memory
6632.15,of an experience within the brain.
6635.33,They then used some
molecular,tools and tricks
6639.26,to label and capture those neurons
6641.98,such that they could go back later
6644.02,and activate those neurons in either
6646.33,the same sequence or
in,a different sequence
6649.86,to the one that occurred during
6651.78,the formation of the memory.
6653.82,"To make a long story short,"
6655.37,and to summarize multiple papers
6657.34,published in incredibly
high,"tier journals,"
6660.66,journals like Nature and Science
6662.1,"which are extremely stringent,"
6663.83,found that whether or not
those,particular neurons
6668.96,were played in the precise sequence
6670.72,that happened when they encoded the memory
6673.42,or whether or not those neurons
6674.79,"were played in a different sequence,"
6676.69,"or even if those neurons were played,"
6679.61,"activated that is, all at once"
6682.37,with no temporal sequence.
6684.91,"All firing in concert all at once,"
6688.61,evoked the same behavior.
6691.75,"And in some sense, the same memory."
6695.01,So at a neural circuit
"level,",this is deja vu.
6698.96,This is a different pattern of firing
6701.33,of neurons in the brain leading
6703.12,"to the same sense of what happened,"
6706.26,leading to a particular
emotional,state or behavior.
6711.33,Whether or not this same
sort,of phenomenon occurs
6714.23,when you're walking down the street
6715.45,"and suddenly you feel as if, wow,"
6717.47,I feel like I've been here before.
6718.61,"You meet someone and you feel like,"
6719.94,gosh I feel like I know you.
6721.24,I feel like there's some familiarity here
6723.38,that I can't quite put my finger on.
6724.8,We don't know for sure
that's,what's happening
6727.72,but this is the most mechanistic
6730.21,and logical explanation for what
6732.66,"has for many decades, if"
not,"hundreds of years,"
6735.8,has been described as deja vu.
6737.7,So for those of you that
experience,"deja vu often,"
6740.52,just know that this
reflects,a normal pattern
6743.72,of encoding experiences and events
6746.0,within your hippocampus.
6748.198,I'm not aware of any
pathological,situations
6750.87,where the presence of deja
vu,inhibits daily life.
6754.85,Some people like the sensation of deja vu.
6757.46,Other people don't.
6758.67,"Almost everybody, however, describes it"
6760.48,as somewhat eerie.
6761.86,This idea that even though you're in
6763.35,"a very different place, even"
though,you're interacting
6765.19,"with a very different person,"
that,you could somehow
6768.83,feel as if this has happened before.
6771.02,"And just realize this,"
that,"your hippocampus,"
6773.81,while it is exquisitely good at encoding
6777.73,"new types of perceptions, new experiences,"
6781.93,"new emotions, new"
contingencies,and relationships
6785.67,"of life events, it is not infinitely large"
6788.96,nor does it have an infinite bucket full
6792.28,of different options
of,different sequences
6794.26,for those neurons to play.
6795.58,So in a lot of ways it makes perfect sense
6797.87,that sometimes we would feel as if
6799.71,a given experience had
happened,previously.
6802.14,I'd like to cover one additional tool
6804.13,that you can use to improve
learning,and memory.
6806.42,"And I should mention, this is"
a,particularly powerful one
6809.52,and it's one that I'm definitely
going,to employ myself.
6814.35,This is based on a paper from none other
6816.89,than Wendy Suzuki at New York University.
6819.41,We talked about her a little bit earlier.
6821.02,"And again, she's going"
to,be on the podcast
6822.94,in our next episode.
6825.06,And is just an incredible researcher.
6826.42,I've known Wendy for a number of years
6827.86,and it's only in the
"last,",I would say five
6829.64,or six years that she's really shifted
6831.17,her laboratory toward generating protocols
6834.77,that human beings can use.
6836.13,"And she's putting that to great effect,"
6838.63,great positive effect I should say.
6840.46,Publishing papers of the sort
6842.01,that I'm about to describe.
6842.843,But also incorporating some of these tools
6844.9,and protocols into the learning curriculum
6847.29,and the lifestyle curriculum
of,students at NYU.
6850.41,Which I think is a terrific initiative.
6852.55,So you don't need to be an NYU student
6854.06,in order to benefit from her work.
6855.64,I'm going to tell you
about,some of that work now
6857.14,and she'll tell you
about,this and much more
6859.79,in the episode that follows this one.
6861.67,The title of this paper
will,tell you a lot
6864.01,about where we're going.
6864.95,The title is Brief Daily
Meditation,Enhances
6867.63,"Attention, Memory, Mood,"
and,Emotional Regulation
6871.24,in Non-Experienced Meditators.
6873.92,If ever there was an
incentive,"to meditate,"
6877.04,it is the data contained
within,this paper.
6880.554,I want to briefly describe the study
6881.91,and then I also want to emphasize
6884.45,that when you meditate
is,absolutely critical.
6887.54,I'll talk about that just at the end.
6889.6,This is a study that involves
subjects,aged 18 to 45.
6894.24,None of whom were experienced
mediators,prior to this study.
6899.17,There were two general
groups,in this study.
6902.49,One group did a 13 minute long meditation
6906.83,and this meditation was a
fairly,conventional meditation.
6909.98,They would sit or lie down.
6911.88,"They would do somewhat of a body scan,"
6914.28,evaluating for instance
how,tense or relaxed
6916.7,they felt throughout their body
6917.74,and they would focus on their breathing.
6919.61,Trying to bring their attention
back,to their breathing
6921.52,and to the state of their body
as,the meditation progressed.
6926.13,"The other group, which we"
can,call the control group
6928.77,"listened to of all things, a podcast."
6931.7,They did not listen to this podcast.
6933.52,"They listened to Radio Lab,"
which,"is a popular podcast,"
6936.64,for an equivalent amount of time.
6938.56,But they were not
instructed,to do any kind
6940.13,of body scan or pay
attention,to their breathing.
6943.34,Every subject in the study
either,meditated daily
6946.27,or listened to a equivalent
duration,podcast daily
6949.46,for a period of eight weeks.
6951.88,And the experimenters
measured,a large number
6954.799,"of things, of variables, as we say."
6958.05,They looked at measures
of,emotion regulation.
6960.56,They actually measured
"cortisol,",a stress hormone.
6963.02,"They measured, as the title suggests,"
6965.25,attention and memory and so forth.
6967.78,And the basic takeaway of this study
6970.37,is that eight weeks but not four weeks
6973.43,of this daily 13 minute a day mediation
6976.29,had a significant effect in improving
6979.94,"attention, memory, mood,"
and,emotion regulation.
6984.59,I find this study to be very interesting
6986.86,"and in fact, important because most of us"
6989.81,have heard about the positive effects
6991.09,of meditation on things
like,stress reduction.
6994.12,Or on things such as improving sleep.
6996.74,And I want to come back
to,sleep in a few moments
6999.26,because it turns out to
be,very important feature
7001.13,of this study.
7003.19,This particular study I like so much
7005.72,because they used a really broad array
7008.37,of measurements for cognitive function.
7011.29,Things like the Wisconsin
Card,Sorting Task.
7013.3,I'm not going to go into this.
7014.28,"Things like the Stroop Task and they also,"
7016.39,"as I mentioned, measured cortisol."
7018.73,"And many other things, including,"
not,"surprisingly, memory."
7023.31,And people's ability to
remember,certain types
7026.16,"of information, in fact"
varied,types of information.
7028.84,"And the basic takeaway was, again,"
7031.78,that you could get really
robust,improvements
7034.22,"in learning and memory, mood and attention"
7036.77,from just 13 minutes a day of meditation.
7039.65,Now there's an important
twist,in this study
7041.41,that I want to emphasize.
7042.81,If you read into the
discussion,of the study
7045.3,it's mentioned that somehow meditation
7048.73,did not improve but actually
impaired,sleep quality
7052.37,compared to the control subjects.
7053.937,"And you might think,"
"wow,",why would that be?
7056.12,"I mean, meditation is"
supposed,to reduce our stress.
7058.9,Stress is supposed to inhibit sleep.
7060.73,And therefore why would sleep get worse?
7064.49,"Well, what's interesting"
is,the time of day
7067.07,when most of these subjects tended
7068.96,to do their meditation.
7071.24,Most of the subjects in this study
7072.72,did their meditation late in the day.
7074.45,This is often the case in experiments.
7076.11,I know this because we run experiments
7078.29,with human subjects in my laboratory
7079.87,and people are paid some amount of money
7082.07,in order to participate
or,they're given something
7084.72,as compensation for being in the study.
7086.14,"But often times the meditation,"
7088.53,or in the case of my
"lab,",the respiration work
7091.01,or other kinds of things
that,they're assigned to do
7093.63,"are not their top, top priority."
7095.52,And we understand this.
7096.63,"But in this study, the"
majority,of subjects here
7098.6,I'm reading completed
their,meditation sessions
7101.36,from somewhere between 8:00 and 11:00 P.M.
7104.5,And sometimes even between
12:00,and 3:00 A.M.
7107.69,I think there probably were a lot
7108.64,of college students
enrolled,in this study.
7110.51,And their hours often are late shifted.
7113.68,That impaired sleep.
7115.137,And this raises a bigger theme
that,I think is important.
7117.8,Many times before on this podcast
7119.76,and certainly in the episode
7120.71,on mastering sleep and
conquering,or mastering stress
7124.62,those episodes we talked
about,"the value, again,"
7126.87,of these non-sleep deep
rest,"protocols, NSDR,"
7129.87,for reducing the activity
7132.47,of your sympathetic nervous system.
7134.01,"The alertness, so-called stress arm"
7136.45,of your autonomic nervous system.
7138.57,The one that makes you feel really alert.
7140.5,NSDR is superb for reducing
your,"level of alertness,"
7144.45,"increasing your level of calmness,"
7145.82,and putting you into a so-called more
7146.96,"parasympathetic, relaxed state."
7149.9,"Meditation does that too, but"
it,also increases attention.
7154.24,"If you think about meditation,"
7156.29,meditation involves
focusing,on your breath
7158.61,and constantly focusing
back,on your breath
7160.65,and trying to avoid the distraction
7162.1,of things you're thinking or
things,that you're hearing.
7164.3,"And coming, so-called, back to your body,"
7166.68,back to your breath.
7168.05,"So meditation is actually,"
7170.5,it has a high attentional load.
7173.12,It requires a lot of
prefrontal,cortical activity
7175.78,that's involved in attention.
7177.15,Which then logically relates
7180.71,to one of the outcomes of this study
7182.87,which is that attention ability
7184.6,is improved in daily meditators.
7187.73,It also points out that increasing
7189.58,the level of attention and the activity
7191.44,"of your prefrontal cortex may,"
7193.09,"and I want to emphasize may,"
7194.01,because here I'm speculating
about,"the underlying mechanism,"
7196.57,inhibit your ability to fall asleep.
7199.12,So while we have
meditation,on the one hand
7201.18,that does tend to put us into a calm state
7203.09,"but it is a calm, very focused state."
7205.6,"In fact, attention and focus are inherent"
7208.17,to most forms of meditation.
7210.08,"Non-sleep deep rest, such as Yoga Nidra"
7212.78,as some of you know it to be.
7214.94,"Or NSDR, there's a terrific NSDR script"
7218.09,that's available free online
that's,put out by Madefor.
7220.067,"So you can go to YouTube, NSDR, Madefor."
7222.44,You can also go do a search for NSDR.
7224.613,There's a number of these
available,"out there,"
7226.95,"again, at no cost."
7228.92,Those NSDR protocols tend to put people
7232.37,into a state of deep relaxation
7234.67,but also very low attention.
7238.01,And we have to assume very low activation
7241.2,of the prefrontal cortex.
7242.7,So the takeaways from this
study,are several fold.
7244.64,"First of all, that daily meditation"
7246.84,of 13 minutes can enhance your ability
7249.61,to pay attention and to learn.
7251.33,It can truly enhance memory.
7254.43,"However, you need to do that"
for,at least eight weeks
7257.97,in order to start to
see,the effects to occur
7260.7,and we have to presume
that,you have to continue
7262.94,those meditation training sessions.
7266.36,"In fact, they found"
that,if people only did
7268.78,four weeks of meditation
these,effects didn't show up.
7271.07,Now eight weeks might
seem,"like a long time,"
7273.07,but I think that 13 minutes a day
7274.65,is not actually that big
of,a time commitment.
7278.54,And the results of this study certainly
7280.62,"incentivize me to start adopting a,"
7283.26,I'm going for 15 minutes a day now.
7284.91,I've been an on and off
meditator,for a number of years.
7287.77,"I've been pretty good about it lately,"
7289.2,but I confess I've been
doing,far shorter meditations
7291.97,of anywhere from three to
"five,",or maybe 10 minutes.
7294.71,I'm going to ramp that
up,to 15 minutes a day.
7297.6,And I'm doing that specifically to try
7299.56,and access these improvements
in,cognitive ability
7302.31,and our abilities to learn.
7303.74,"Also based on the data in this paper,"
7305.79,I'm going to do those meditation sessions
7307.53,"either early in the day, such"
as,"immediately after waking,"
7311.65,or close to it.
7312.88,So I might get my sunshine first.
7314.39,"I'm, as you all know, very"
big,on getting sunlight
7316.61,in the eyes early in the day.
7317.97,As much as one can and
as,early as one can.
7321.33,Once the sun is out.
7322.74,But certainly doing it early in the day
7324.95,and not past 5:00 P.M. or so
7327.69,in order to make sure that
I,don't inhibit sleep.
7329.96,"Because I think this, the"
result,that they describe
7331.98,of meditation inhibiting quality sleep
7334.91,compared to controls is an important one
7337.94,to pay attention to.
7339.1,No pun intended.
7340.2,Today we covered a lot
of,aspects of memory
7342.55,and how to improve your memory.
7344.51,We talked about the
different,forms of memory
7346.3,and we talked about some of the underlying
7348.01,neural circuitry of memory formation
7350.4,and we talked about the emotional saliency
7354.06,and intensity of what
you're,trying to learn
7356.48,has a profound impact on
whether,or not you learn
7359.73,in response to some sort of experience.
7362.01,"Whether or not that experience is reading,"
7364.57,"or mathematics, or music, or"
"language,",or a physical skill.
7369.05,It doesn't matter.
7370.29,The more intense of an
emotional,state that you're in
7374.12,in the period immediately
following,"that learning,"
7377.07,the more likely you are to remember
7379.46,whatever it is that
you're,trying to learn.
7381.47,And we talked about the neuro chemicals
7382.83,that explain that effect.
7384.6,About epinephrine and
corticosterones,like cortisol.
7388.37,And how adjusting the timing of those
7390.62,is so key to enhancing your memory.
7393.33,And we talked about the different ways
7394.63,to enhance those chemicals.
7395.7,Everything ranging from
cold,water to pharmacology
7399.23,and even just adjusting
the,emotional state
7401.63,within your mind in order to stamp down
7404.26,and remember experiences better.
7406.12,We also talked about how
to,"leverage exercise,"
7408.18,"in particular, load bearing exercise"
7411.73,in order to evoke the release of hormones
7413.93,like osteocalcin which can travel
7415.48,from your bones to your brain and enhance
7417.1,your ability to learn.
7418.55,And we talked about a new
form,of photographic memory.
7421.04,Not the traditional type
of,photographic memory
7423.82,in which people can remember everything
7425.34,they look at very easily.
7427.2,"But rather, taking mental snapshots"
7429.16,of things that you see.
7430.5,"Again, emphasizing that will create"
7432.61,a better memory of what you see
7434.28,"when you take that mental snapshot,"
7435.6,but will actually reduce your memory
7437.65,for the things that you
hear,at that moment.
7439.68,And we discussed the really exciting data
7441.29,looking at how particular
meditation,protocols
7444.01,can enhance memory but
also,attention and mood.
7447.7,"However, if done too late in the day,"
7450.8,can actually disrupt
sleep,precisely because
7453.59,those meditation protocols
can,enhance attention.
7457.38,Now I know that many of you are interested
7459.632,in neuro chemicals that can
enhance,learning and memory.
7462.42,And I intend to cover those in deep detail
7466.64,in a future episode.
7468.04,"However, for the sake of"
what,"was discussed today,"
7470.29,please understand that any number
7473.33,of different neuro chemicals can evoke
7475.1,or can increase the amount of adrenaline
7477.33,that's circulating in your brain and body.
7479.63,And it's less important how one accesses
7483.17,that increase in adrenaline.
7485.02,"Again, this can be done"
through,behavioral protocols
7486.93,or through pharmacology.
7489.48,Assuming that those behavioral protocols
7491.86,"and pharmacology are safe for you,"
7493.9,it really doesn't matter how you evoke
7495.81,"the adrenaline release because remember,"
7497.75,adrenaline is the final common pathway
7500.19,"by which particular experiences,"
particular,perceptions
7503.54,are stamped into memory.
7505.67,Which answers our very
first,question raised
7508.12,at the beginning of the episode.
7509.33,"Which is, why do we"
remember,anything at all?
7512.14,"Right, that was the"
question,that we raised.
7514.29,Why is it that from morning 'til night
7516.22,throughout your entire life you have tons
7517.93,"of sensory experience,"
tons,of perceptions.
7519.75,Why is it that some are remembered
7521.88,and others are not?
7523.19,While I would never want to distill
7525.44,an important question such as that down
7527.48,"to a one molecule type of answer,"
7529.87,I think we can confidently say based on
7532.3,the vast amount of animal
and,human research data
7536.18,"that epinephrine, adrenaline,"
7538.61,and some of the other chemicals
7539.94,"that it acts with in concert, is in fact,"
7543.52,the way that we remember particular events
7547.2,and not all events.

7588.09,at any level that you like.
7589.62,During today's episode and
on,many previous episodes
7591.99,"of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
we,discuss supplements.
7594.91,While supplements aren't
necessary,"for everybody,"
7597.24,many people derive
tremendous,benefit from them.
7599.37,For things like enhancing sleep and focus
7601.43,"and indeed, for learning and memory."
7603.5,For that reason the Huberman Lab Podcast
7605.36,is now partnered with
Momentous,Supplements.
7607.8,The reason we've partnered with Momentous
7609.27,is several fold.
7610.45,"First of all, we wanted"
to,have one location
7612.64,where people could go to
access,"single ingredient,"
7615.59,high quality versions of the supplements
7617.44,that we were discussing on this podcast.
7619.81,This is a critical issue.
7621.03,A lot of supplement companies out there
7622.62,sell excellent supplements
7623.81,but they combine different ingredients
7625.77,into different formulations
7627.11,which make it very hard to figure out
7628.68,exactly what works for you
7630.16,and to arrive at the
minimal,effective dose
7632.83,of the various compounds
that,are best for you.
7634.97,Which we think is extremely important
7636.83,and that's certainly
the,most scientific way
7638.91,and rigorous way to approach any kind
7640.8,of supplementation regime.
7642.29,So Momentous has made these
single,ingredient formulations
7644.93,on the basis of what we suggested to them
7647.3,"and I'm happy to say, they"
also,ship internationally.
7650.07,So whether or not you're
in,"the US or abroad,"
7652.1,they'll ship to you.
7652.96,If you'd like to see the
supplements,recommended
7654.74,"on the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
7656.5,you can go to LiveMomentous.com/Huberman.
7660.07,They've started to
assemble,the supplements
7662.03,that we've talked about on the podcast
7663.54,and in the upcoming
weeks,they will be adding
7665.93,many more supplements such
that,in a brief period of time
7670.6,"most, if not all of the compounds"
7672.34,that are discussed on this podcast
7674.06,"will be there, again,"
in,"single ingredient,"
7676.66,extremely high quality formulations
7678.53,that you can use to arrive
7679.7,at the best supplement protocols for you.
7682.02,We also include behavioral protocols
7684.14,that can combined with
supplementation,protocols
7686.56,in order to deliver the maximum effect.
7688.85,"Once again, that's"
LiveMomentous.com/Huberman.,
7692.18,And if you're not already
following,us on Twitter
7694.29,"and Instagram, it's HubermanLab"
7696.26,on both Twitter and Instagram.
7698.18,There I describe science
and,science related tools.
7701.28,Some of which overlap with the content
7702.72,"of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
7704.11,but much of which is distinct
7705.47,from the content of the
Huberman,Lab Podcast.
7707.82,We also have a newsletter called
7709.43,the Huberman Lab Neural Network.
7710.76,That newsletter provides summary protocols
7713.92,and information from our
various,podcast episodes.
7716.92,It does not cost anything to sign up.
7718.5,"You can go to HubermanLab.com,"
go,to the menu
7721.31,and click on newsletter.
7722.73,You just provide your email
and,"I should point out,"
7724.48,we do not share your
email,with anyone else.
7726.46,We have a very clear privacy policy
7728.82,that you can read there.
7730.33,And that newsletter comes
out,about once a month.
7732.3,You can also see some sample newsletters.
7734.0,"Things like the toolkit for sleep,"
7735.81,or for neural plasticity and for various
7738.01,other topics covered on
the,Huberman Lab Podcast.
7740.6,"Once again, thank you for joining me today"
7742.58,to discuss the neurobiology
of,learning and memory
7744.82,and how to improve your memory using
7747.08,science based tools.
7748.61,"And last, but certainly not least,"
7750.65,thank you for your interest in science.
