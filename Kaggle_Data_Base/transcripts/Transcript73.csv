0.833,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
1.92,where we discuss science
3.207,and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.36,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
10.35,and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology,and Ophthalmology
12.799,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.791,"Today, we're talking all about fasting."
17.552,"And anytime we're talking about fasting,"
20.27,"we are also talking about eating,"
22.07,because we all need to
eat,sooner or later.
24.74,We're going to talk about how fasting
26.038,and when we eat influences
29.216,a large range of aspects
31.343,"of our health and wellbeing,"
both,physical and mental.
35.59,"So, well, nowadays,"
36.76,most people are familiar with
the,"term intermittent fasting,"
40.323,also sometimes called
time-restricted,feeding.
43.651,I think most people
don't,really understand
46.082,how that process works.
47.768,It's sort of obvious that
intermittent,"fasting,"
50.45,"aka time-restricted feeding,"
52.398,involves eating at certain
periods,"of each 24-hour cycle,"
56.35,or maybe even not eating for
entire,"days, in some cases."
59.812,"But, if you think about it,"
everybody,sleeps eventually.
63.345,"And therefore, because people"
don't,"eat during their sleep,"
67.581,almost everybody is employing some form
70.64,of intermittent fasting or
time-restricted,feeding.
73.93,What we're going to talk about today
75.42,is how particular schedules
of,time restricted feeding
79.384,can impact our health in different ways.
82.34,"And when I say different ways, I mean,"
84.16,we're going to talk about
how,"intermittent fasting,"
86.828,"aka time-restricted feeding,"
impacts,"weight loss,"
90.588,"fat loss in particular,"
92.317,"muscle maintenance, and"
loss,"and gain, organ health,"
96.63,such as gut health and
liver,"health, the genome,"
100.2,"the epigenome, inflammation,"
"sickness,","recovery,"
105.26,"and healing from sickness,"
"exercise,","cognition,"
108.87,"mood, and lifespan."
110.91,So we're going to cover a
tremendous,amount of information.
113.42,I promise to make it
all,"directly accessible,"
116.39,regardless of whether or not you have
117.74,a background in biology and
metabolic,science or not.
122.026,I'm also going to talk
about,a lot of tools.
124.71,"In fact, I'm going to discuss"
126.36,a number of tools during today's episode
128.451,that actually make it such
130.179,that you don't have to
follow,"any feeding schedule,"
133.988,"or fasting schedule, same thing"
136.55,"if you think about it,"
137.89,"in any absolutely strict regimented way,"
142.056,meaning if you were to only
eat,during an eight hour period
146.38,"of each day, most of the time,"
147.86,but then occasionally eat
across,a 12 hour period
150.21,"of the day,"
151.249,"in theory, that could"
actually,have pretty serious
154.7,detrimental health effects.
156.26,"And yet, there are things that you can do"
157.705,to attenuate those negative effects.
160.31,"In fact,"
161.143,there are things that
you,can do and or take
162.815,that can make it as if
you,did not eat at all.
166.235,And so we'll discuss what those tools are.
168.324,"And in many cases, for sake"
of,"health, weight loss,"
171.66,"and performance,"
172.52,making the body think that
it,did not eat at all can
175.595,actually be quite beneficial.
177.469,"So today, we're going to cover mechanism"
179.163,and we're going to cover tools.
181.05,"Before we do that,"
182.14,I want to highlight a particular
result,that was published
184.82,"recently, because it"
serves,as a useful backbone
187.083,as we wade into the
conversation,about fasting.
190.442,This is a study that was published
192.93,in the journal Cell Metabolism:
A,"Cell Press Journal,"
195.88,excellent journal.
197.16,And the title of the paper
is,"""Fasting Blood Glucose"
200.9,as a Predictor of Mortality:
Lost,"in Translation""."
204.477,And I'll explain what
the,"""Lost in Translation"""
206.74,part means in a moment.
207.736,"But the basic takeaway of this study,"
209.827,and I should mention that
210.9,the first author of the
study,"is Palliyaguru,"
213.763,"PALLIYAGURU, guru,"
218.734,"Palliyaguru, et al."
222.77,The basic finding of the
study,"is that in humans,"
225.96,higher blood glucose is
associated,with mortality.
231.402,"And in fact, if you look at blood glucose,"
234.3,"resting blood glucose across the lifespan,"
236.61,"what you find is as people age,"
238.087,resting blood glucose goes up.
240.85,"Now, this is very interesting,"
242.11,because for a long time it was thought
244.33,that metabolism actually
goes,down as we age.
246.95,"And to some extent, that's true,"
248.423,but the reductions in metabolism
250.64,are not nearly as robust
as,we once thought
253.0,that they were across the lifespan.
255.08,"However, unless there's something done"
257.604,to mitigate the increase
in,blood glucose associated
260.73,"with the aging,"
261.87,"almost everybody experiences a gradual,"
264.309,but regular increase in
resting,blood glucose
268.28,that predicts mortality.
270.37,"Now, the title, as I mentioned,"
271.73,"is ""Fasting Blood Glucose"
as,a Predictor of Mortality:
274.72,"Lost in Translation""."
275.767,And the reason that they
included,"""Lost in Translation"""
278.63,"in the title is that what I just told you,"
280.768,that increases in resting blood
283.18,"glucose predict mortality, or"
are,"correlated with mortality,"
286.3,is true for human beings
287.858,"and for non-human primates, monkeys."
290.607,But the opposite is true in mice.
293.163,And so I thought it was important
294.97,to use this study as an example
297.122,"of where it studies in mice often,"
299.647,"but not always, translate to humans"
302.249,and to non-human primates.
304.23,"So today, I'm going to be careful"
305.5,to distinguish when a study
307.15,"was performed in mice versus in humans,"
309.01,because it seems that at
least,"when discussing feeding,"
313.424,blood glucose and other aspects of diet
315.606,"as they relate to health and wellbeing,"
317.659,whether or not a study
was,performed in rodents
320.34,or in humans can be very important.
323.96,"In this case,"
324.8,the results were directly
180,degrees opposite
327.335,to one another.
329.11,"In other words, in mice,"
330.27,"resting blood glucose went down,"
332.148,and was associated with mortality.
334.6,So lower blood glucose
associated,with mortality.
336.63,"Whereas in humans,"
337.463,higher resting blood glucose
was,associated with mortality.
340.25,"And obviously,"
341.12,what we're mostly interested in is health
343.389,"and wellbeing of ourselves, of humans."
346.2,I'm sure there are some people
out,there that are intensely
348.69,concerned about the health
and,"wellbeing of mice,"
350.62,which you could imagine
352.156,a few rare contexts
where,"that's important,"
354.61,but obviously most of us are
interested,in human health.
357.22,So I'll be sure to emphasize
when,studies were performed
360.13,in humans versus in mice.
362.21,"Before we begin,"
363.22,I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
364.592,is separate from my teaching
and,research roles at Stanford.
367.355,"It is, however,"
368.68,part of my desire and
effort,to bring zero cost
370.94,to consumer information
371.93,about science and science-related tools
374.03,to the general public.
375.66,"In keeping with that theme,"
376.7,I'd like to thank the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
379.52,Our first sponsor is ROKA.
380.893,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
383.237,that are the absolute highest quality.
385.687,I've spent a lifetime
working,on the visual system
388.58,"and how we see, and ROKA,"
391.206,which is a company developed
392.85,by two all-American swimmers
394.05,from Stanford has developed eyeglasses
396.08,and sunglasses that take into
account,"the science of vision,"
398.955,and they've produced an
absolutely,terrific product.
401.698,That product involves glasses
403.284,"that, first of all, are very lightweight."
406.257,"Second of all, can be worn"
when,performing any activity.
409.811,They really are performance
eyeglasses,and sunglasses.
412.83,So whether or not you're sweating
413.92,"or running around,"
414.88,"whether or not you're working,"
whether,"or not you're hiking,"
417.49,"cycling, et cetera,"
418.51,you can wear them for
essentially,any activity.
420.4,The nice thing is they also
have,a great aesthetic.
422.75,So unlike a lot of other performance
423.999,sunglasses and eyeglasses out there
425.927,that can make people
427.3,look more or less like
"cyborgs,",ROKA eyeglasses
429.81,"and sunglasses look great,"
431.24,whether or not you're wearing
them,"to dinner or at work,"
433.05,or whether or not you're headed out
434.01,for a run or a cycle or
something,of that sort.
436.602,"As I mentioned before,"
they're,extremely lightweight.
438.76,They don't slip off.
439.671,"And that's true,"
441.34,regardless of what activity
you're,engaging in.
442.968,If you'd like to try ROKA
"glasses,","you can go to ROKA.com,"

451.888,Today's podcast is also brought
453.64,to us by InsideTracker.
454.941,InsideTracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
457.93,that analyzes data from your blood
459.5,and DNA to help you better
460.89,understand your body and help
you,meet your health goals.
463.78,I've long been a believer
464.91,"in getting regular blood work done,"
466.65,for the simple reason
that,many of the processes
468.98,that are occurring in your body
470.07,that impact your immediate and
471.93,long-term health can only be assessed
473.796,from a quality blood test.
475.49,"And nowadays, with the"
advent,"of modern DNA tests,"
477.654,you can also assess your genome
479.284,and how that's impacting your immediate
481.34,and long-term health.
482.286,The problem with a lot
of,blood and DNA tests
484.9,"is you get information back,"
485.963,but you don't know what to
do,with that information.
488.27,And InsideTracker has solved that problem.
490.56,They have a very easy to use dashboard
491.953,"so that when you get your results back,"
493.703,"it will tell you, for instance,"
495.81,if your levels of a
particular,metabolic factor
497.754,"or hormone are too high or too low,"
499.79,"what you can do, what you can take,"
501.91,how you can change your nutrition
503.11,in order to adjust those levels
504.59,and get them where you want them to be.
506.21,This is tremendously useful
508.05,and takes all the guesswork out
509.33,of what to do with biomarker information.
512.37,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker,"
513.464,you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
516.79,to get 25% off any
518.014,"of InsideTracker's plans,"

521.98,Today's episode is brought
to,us by Helix Sleep.
524.067,Helix Sleep makes mattresses
526.15,and pillows that are tailored
527.52,"to your unique sleep needs,"
529.1,"and in doing so, provide"
the,best sleep possible.
531.782,I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
533.658,"about a year or so ago,"
534.988,and it is the best sleep
that,I've ever had.
537.381,"If you go to the Helix site,"
538.804,"you take a brief two minute quiz,"
540.963,"and that quiz asks you questions such as,"
543.227,"do you tend to sleep on your stomach,"
545.14,"your side, or your back?"
546.21,Do you tend to run hot
or,cold during the night?
548.14,"Maybe you don't know,"
549.07,and they match you to
a,particular mattress
550.92,that's ideal for your sleep needs.
552.41,"In my case, I matched to"
the,so-called Dusk mattress.
554.838,I've been sleeping on a Dusk
"mattress,","and as I mentioned,"
557.75,it's absolutely terrific.
559.176,Best sleep I've ever had.
560.688,It's really key to get a mattress
that's,best suited to you.
564.409,If you're interested in
upgrading,"your mattress,"
566.5,"you can go to HelixSleep.com,"
take,"that two minute quiz,"
569.37,and they'll match you to a
customized,mattress for you.
571.467,And you'll get up to $200 off
any,"of your mattress orders,"
575.69,and you'll get two free pillows.
576.972,"If you're interested in Helix Sleep,"
578.64,"you can go to HelixSleep.com/huberman,"
580.716,"and you get up to $200 off your mattress,"
582.862,and two free pillows.
584.53,I'd like to point you
toward,a valuable resource
586.529,that's also zero cost and
is,available now online.
591.065,This is an event that was recorded.
593.784,"The event was held by Logitech,"
595.978,and I was fortunate enough
to,partake in this event.
598.466,And the entire event
was,centered around how
600.695,to be a more effective learner
602.433,and teacher using the modern
principles,of neuroplasticity.
606.777,So at the link in the
caption,"for this episode,"
610.325,you can go to what was called
the,Rethink Education Event.
614.41,"And there, I gave a seminar"
of,about 20 or 30 minutes
617.645,describing the modern
neuroscience,"of neuroplasticity,"
621.98,the nervous system's ability
623.18,to change in response to experience.
624.988,I focused mainly on human studies
627.29,and how different structures
and,"different things,"
631.627,and tools that one can
633.0,implement in the classroom and outside
634.73,of the classroom can lead to
faster,"and more pervasive,"
638.65,longer lasting learning of
motor,"skills, music skills,"
641.93,"mathematical skills,"
language,"skills, et cetera,"
644.556,all based on quality
peer,reviewed research.
646.963,"So if you'd like to check that out,"
648.908,you can head to that link.
650.31,You'll also see an example of
some,"of those tools in action,"
653.149,in a music classroom of a
phenomenal,"music teacher,"
657.039,"Ben Edie, who's a teacher out in Pasadena,"
660.625,"who has applied these tools,"
662.26,"at least to my knowledge,"
for,the first time ever.
664.222,"Of course, all the tools"
665.681,that are there are listed out
666.83,in what I call a
plasticity,"super protocol,"
669.895,and all those tools can be applied
672.77,to learning and teaching in
any,format that you like.
675.79,So check it out.
676.73,It's in the caption to
this,"week's episode,"
678.451,"and it will remain there,"
680.49,it's up on YouTube and
I,hope you enjoy it.
682.482,"Okay, so let's talk"
about,"feeding, fasting,"
685.222,health and performance.
687.434,And I want to just establish
a,few foundational terms
691.362,so that we're all on the same page.
693.721,"First of all,"
694.8,rather than talk about fasting
or,"time restricted feeding,"
697.756,I'm largely going to talk
about,"time restricted feeding,"
701.08,but please understand that
time,restricted feeding
703.342,is just one side of the coin
705.626,that is a two-sided coin
708.12,"that includes fasting on the one hand,"
709.96,"not eating, and time restricted"
feeding,"on the other hand,"
713.14,"I may occasionally say fasting,"
715.18,but because fasting and
eating,establish different
718.278,"biological conditions in the body,"
720.96,time-restricted feeding
722.06,is the term that I will use to describe
724.606,the overall plan of
restricting,one's eating window
728.789,as it's called to a particular
phase,"of each 24 hour day,"
733.85,or in some cases two particular
days,within the week.
738.36,"Because as you'll soon learn,"
739.573,there are aspects of
time,"restricted feeding,"
741.947,"aka fasting, that involve"
eating,"every other day,"
745.817,or eating one way for five days
748.88,and then fasting for
two,"days, and so forth."
751.21,So I'll be very precise about
what,I mean and why I mean it.
754.396,"But for the time being,"
756.45,I'm going to refer to
time,restricted feeding
759.54,as a way to put an umbrella
over,this conversation.
763.433,"Second of all,"
764.437,I am going to emphasize a
lot,of biological mechanism.
767.848,"If you've listened to this podcast before,"
769.703,you know that I always begin
with,biological mechanism.
773.59,I do describe tools of how to
implement,"those mechanisms,"
776.936,but I wholeheartedly believe
that,knowing mechanisms
781.05,and understanding how these processes work
783.138,gives you tremendous
785.3,"flexibility and understanding,"
787.172,and control over the processes
789.671,of your mental and physical health.
791.53,Whereas if I were to just list off a menu
793.862,of things to do and not
to,"do, those will work,"
797.952,but those will not give you the kind
800.9,of understanding that would allow you
802.96,"to navigate through life, through travel,"
805.59,"through dinners out, through"
different,"exercise schedules,"
808.935,whether or not you're one age
or,"another age, male, female,"
812.21,"et cetera, I'm giving you mechanisms"
814.402,so that you can gain more
control,over the systems
817.078,in your brain and body.
818.775,"Everything's timestamped,"
820.39,"so if you want to jump to the to do's,"
822.03,"you can certainly do that,"
823.27,but I encourage you to hang in
there,for the mechanism bit.
826.74,I will make it all very clear
827.844,"because if you understand mechanism,"
829.718,you are in a true place
of,power and control
831.985,over your biology.
833.332,If ever there was a topic
that,"is controversial,"
836.73,"especially on the internet,"
838.05,it is that of diet and nutrition.
840.76,So I'm wading into this
with,a smile and in eager
843.769,anticipation of all the but but but this
847.43,"and but but but that, and wait,"
848.742,but this showed that.
850.376,"Here's the deal,"
851.96,we need to precisely define
854.3,what it is that we're talking about
855.79,when we talk about nutrition.
857.45,I'm going to give you an example
859.32,of a study that was
published,"a few years ago,"
861.76,"2018, by a colleague of mine at Stanford,"
864.58,"Chris Gardner, he's a terrific professor"
868.94,of nutrition and has done a lot
870.826,of important studies on
how,nutrition impacts
873.843,different aspects of health.
875.863,This is a large-scale study.
878.02,"It was published in JAMA,"
879.66,the Journal of the American
Medical,"Association,"
881.65,one of the very top tier
journals,"in the area of medicine,"
885.69,and certainly for a paper on nutrition
887.68,to show up there meant that it had
889.17,to meet an exceedingly high standard.
891.821,"This paper, where Chris"
is,"the first author,"
896.26,"it's Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA,"
898.872,looked at weight loss
in,people following one
903.643,particular diet versus
another,particular diet.
906.703,And this was a 12 month weight loss study.
909.55,So it was focused
specifically,"on weight loss,"
911.777,although they looked at some
other,parameters as well.
914.61,And the basic conclusion of the study was
916.329,that there was no significant difference
919.45,in weight change between
people,"following a healthy,"
922.41,"low fat diet versus a healthy,"
924.042,low carbohydrate diet with significantly
926.011,more dietary fats in them.
928.459,This caused a lot of ripples
931.217,in the world of nutrition
and,"nutritional science,"
935.06,"and certainly in the general population,"
936.957,because anyone that understands diet
940.11,and nutrition would
immediately,"say, but wait,"
942.97,there are all sorts of
different,implications of eating
945.268,"one type of diet, say low"
"carbohydrate,","higher fats,"
948.637,versus a higher
"carbohydrate,",lower fat diet.
951.545,And indeed there are.
953.148,This study was focused specifically
955.202,on fat loss and on weight loss.
958.607,"So as we discuss time restricted feeding,"
963.4,we need to be very precise
964.254,about what are the effects
of,"time restricted feeding,"
967.69,and of eating in particular ways
969.82,"at particular times, we are"
going,"to emphasize again,"
973.18,whether or not the study was
done,"in mice or in humans,"
975.94,"in athletes, in men, in women, or both,"
978.5,but the study from Gardner and colleagues
980.357,"is a beautiful study,"
981.715,and really emphasizes that
983.337,if one's main goal is
simply,"to lose weight,"
986.863,then it really does not
matter,what one eats provided
991.601,that the number of calories burned
994.653,is higher than the number
of,calories ingested.
998.18,"However, anyone out there who understands"
1001.93,"a little bit of biology,"
1003.655,or a lot of biology will agree
1006.0,that there are many factors
1007.272,that impact that calories
burned,part of the equation.
1010.687,Some of those are obvious.
1012.4,"So for instance,"
1013.337,"amount of exercise, type of"
"exercise,","basal metabolic rate,"
1017.91,how much energy one
burns,just sitting there.
1020.039,I've talked before on this podcast
1021.398,"about NEIT, Non Exercise"
Induced,"Thermogenesis,"
1024.8,where if people bounce around
a,"lot and fidget a lot,"
1026.969,they can burn anywhere from
800,"to 2,000 calories per day."
1031.06,So their quote-unquote
basal,metabolic rate
1033.142,is actually much higher simply
1034.68,"because they're fidgeters,"
1035.62,whereas people who tend
to,be more stationary
1037.36,have a lower basal
metabolic,"rate, on average."
1039.85,There's a great science to support this.
1042.249,Metabolic factors and hormones
1045.03,are also very important.
1046.75,"Hormones, such as thyroid hormone"
1048.746,"and insulin and growth hormone,"
1051.37,"and the sex story to hormones,"
testosterone,"and estrogen,"
1053.577,those levels will also
profoundly,influence
1056.197,"the calories out, the"
calories,burned component
1059.341,"of the calories in, calories out equation."
1062.161,So if out there on the internet
1065.45,or in listening to a particular podcast
1067.199,"or speaker, somebody says,"
1068.817,"this is the ideal diet,"
1070.527,"or calories in, calories out does not"
1073.31,"matter, or calories in calories out"
1074.85,is the only thing that matters.
1076.054,I think it's very important to understand
1078.13,"that there are some foundational truths,"
1080.01,"such as calories in, calories out,"
1081.99,"but that of course,"
1083.286,hormone factors and the context in which
1086.75,a given diet regimen is taking place
1089.226,are exceedingly important.
1091.21,A good example of this would be puberty
1094.16,"at that time in life,"
1096.18,sex steroid hormones
are,changing profoundly
1098.22,in the body as our growth
hormone,and other hormones.
1101.26,And much of caloric intake
1103.33,"is directed towards protein synthesis,"
1105.679,towards the production of muscle and bone
1107.9,and other tissues of the body.
1109.23,And that's because of changes in hormones
1111.14,that we call puberty.
1112.53,"So, there's no way that we can drill"
1115.2,into every aspect of a given feeding plan
1118.7,or feeding schedule that would allow us
1122.44,to tap into every aspect of the list
1124.36,"that I read out before weight loss,"
1126.72,"fat loss, muscle organ, genome, epigenome,"
1128.7,"inflammation, exercise,"
"cognition,","mood, and lifespan."
1130.802,"But today, we're going to be very precise"
1133.11,"about how time restricted feeding,"
1135.378,it's very clear from both animal studies
1138.5,and human studies
1139.382,can have a very powerful
and,positive impact
1143.433,on everything from weight loss
1145.66,and fat loss to various health parameters.
1149.189,This is a beautiful literature
1151.04,that's emerged mostly in
the,last 10 or 15 years.
1154.428,"And as we march into this literature,"
1156.71,what you'll see is that there actually
1158.166,is a perfect diet for you on a given day.
1162.602,And that perfect diet for you on
1164.684,"a given day is contextual,"
1167.85,meaning it depends on
what,you did yesterday
1170.017,and what you're going to do tomorrow.
1172.96,So there is a perfect diet for you.
1174.556,"And today, I'm going to arm you"
1175.9,with the mechanisms and understanding
1178.17,that will allow you to define what
1179.62,that perfect diet is
1181.02,and will allow you to eat on a schedule
1183.728,and to eat the things that are going
1186.26,to best serve your goals.
1187.641,So let's talk about eating
and,"what happens when you eat,"
1191.4,and let's talk about
"fasting,","or not eating,"
1194.38,and what happens when you fast.
1196.059,I did an entire episode on eating
1198.596,"and metabolism, and"
hormones,and other factors
1201.62,that impact appetite.
1203.198,We don't have time to go
into,"all those details now,"
1205.67,although you're welcome to
listen,"to that episode as well,"
1209.071,but we can briefly describe
the,overall conditions
1213.044,that are set in the body when we eat
1215.369,and when we don't eat.
1217.825,The key word here is conditions.
1220.498,If I can emphasize anything
"today,",it's that what you eat
1224.434,and when you eat it set
conditions,"in your body,"
1228.935,and those conditions can
be,"very good for you,"
1231.76,"or very bad for you,"
depending,on when you eat.
1235.195,"In fact, when you eat is as"
important,as what you eat.
1241.349,"I'll repeat that, when you eat"
1243.25,"is as important as what you eat,"
1244.83,at least as it relates
to,"health parameters,"
1247.1,"in particular, liver"
health,and mental health.
1250.38,Some simple rules about eating.
1251.92,"First of all, when you eat,"
typically,"your blood glucose,"
1256.55,"your blood sugar, will go up."
1258.464,"Also, insulin levels will go up."
1261.31,Insulin is a hormone that's involved
1263.01,in mobilizing glucose
from,the bloodstream.
1265.954,How much your glucose and insulin go up
1269.67,depends on what you eat
and,how much you eat.
1272.06,"In general, simple sugars,"
including,"fructose from fruit,"
1277.89,"but also sucrose and glucose,"
1279.49,and simple sugars will raise your insulin
1282.45,and blood glucose more
than,complex carbohydrates.
1286.32,"Things like grains, and breads,"
and,"pastas, and so forth,"
1288.66,"and grains, and breads, and"
"pastas,",and so forth will raise
1291.62,your blood glucose more
than,"fibrous carbohydrates,"
1294.026,"like lettuce, and broccoli,"
and,things of that sort.
1297.643,Protein has a somewhat moderate
1300.63,"or modest impact on insulin and glucose,"
1303.2,and fat has the lowest impact
1305.031,on raising your blood
glucose,and blood insulin.
1308.369,So what you eat will
impact,how steep a rise
1312.64,in blood glucose and insulin takes place.
1315.48,And there are a number of factors
1317.3,that are related to your individual health
1319.24,that will also dictate how steep
1320.54,and how high that rise in
glucose,and insulin will be.
1324.57,"For the time being, I'm leaving"
1325.437,out people who have type one diabetes.
1328.38,These are people that don't
manufacture,"their own insulin,"
1331.02,and type two diabetes is
essentially,"insulin insensitivity,"
1336.91,"lack of sensitivity to insulin,"
1338.56,which leads to high blood glucose.
1340.88,"But, when you eat,"
1342.171,blood glucose goes up
and,"when you don't eat,"
1344.81,blood glucose and insulin go down.
1347.085,"The longer it's been since your last meal,"
1349.87,"the lower, typically,"
1350.773,your blood glucose and insulin will be.
1353.66,"And the higher, things like"
"GLP1,","glucagon-like peptide 1,"
1360.053,glucagon being a hormone
that's,also secreted
1363.78,when you are in a fasted state
or,a low blood glucose state.
1369.3,It's involved in mobilizing
various,energy sources
1373.21,"from the body, including fat"
through,"what we call lipolysis,"
1376.562,"also using carbohydrates,"
1378.56,and potentially even using
muscle,as a source of energy.
1381.28,"So, that's kind of a fire hose"
1385.25,of information about what happens
1387.17,"when you eat and don't eat,"
1388.13,"but just think of it this way, blood sugar"
1390.26,"and insulin go up when you eat,"
1391.628,"they go down when you don't eat,"
1393.35,and other hormones go
up,when you don't eat.
1396.21,So there are hormones associated
with,"the fasted state,"
1399.059,and there are hormones associated
1400.608,with the eating and
having,just eaten state.
1404.656,"Now, the most important thing"
1407.09,"to understand is that,"
like,"everything in biology,"
1411.192,this is a process that takes time.
1414.36,"So insulin and glucose go up when we eat,"
1417.237,and it takes some period of time
1418.82,"for them to go down,"
1420.02,"even if we stop eating,"
1421.431,they will remain up for
some,"period of time,"
1424.15,"and then go back down, it takes time."
1426.833,"This is very important,"
1428.65,because if you look at
the,scientific literature
1431.14,"on fasting, on time-restricted feeding,"
1434.554,it's absolutely clear
that,"the health benefits,"
1438.096,"not just the weight loss benefits,"
1440.43,but that the health benefits
1441.94,"from time-restricted feeding,"
1443.13,occur because certain conditions
1445.62,are met in the brain and body
for,a certain amount of time.
1450.4,And that gives us an anchor
1452.062,from which to view what eating
1455.08,is in terms of how it sets
conditions,in the body over time.
1459.64,And if that sounds overly
"analytic,","I promise you,"
1462.94,this is the simplest
1464.11,and best way to think
about,any eating schedule
1466.92,or any eating plan.
1468.53,So I think it's fair to say
that,"in the field of nutrition,"
1471.172,there are a few landmark
studies,that serve
1474.013,as really strong anchors for
building,our understanding
1477.65,of what to eat and what not to eat
1479.717,"and when to eat, depending on our goals."
1482.35,The Gardner study that I mentioned earlier
1484.36,"is one such study,"
1486.1,in that it says if your
goal,"is weight loss,"
1489.114,it really does not matter
what,"foods you consume,"
1493.49,provided that you consume a
"sub-maintenance,",caloric diet.
1497.92,"However, I want to emphasize again,"
1499.665,"that sets aside issues of adherence,"
1504.23,meaning how easy or hard it
is,to adhere to a given diet.
1507.68,Some people find it much easier
1509.16,"to follow a high fat,"
low,carbohydrate diet.
1511.24,Some people fall follow
1512.184,a different diet because it's much easier
1514.21,for them to follow.
1515.6,And some people are concerned
1516.93,with mental performance
and,athletic performance.
1519.01,So that study doesn't
say,"there's a best diet,"
1521.693,what it says is that what you consume
1523.866,is less important than the
amount,"of food that you consume,"
1528.64,"at least for sake of weight loss,"
1531.0,not necessarily for sake of health.
1533.67,"Now, the study that I'm going"
1535.56,to refer to next is what I would consider
1538.21,the second major pillar
of,nutritional studies.
1541.05,This is a truly landmark study
1542.46,"that was carried out by Satchin Panda,"
1545.878,who is a professor at the Salk Institute
1548.7,"of Biological Studies in San Diego,"
1549.943,"an absolutely phenomenal institution,"
1552.91,and an absolutely phenomenal researcher.
1554.969,"I've known Satchin for a number of years,"
1556.97,and I want to emphasize
that,the current literature
1560.168,on intermittent fasting
1562.19,and time restricted feeding can largely
1563.707,be attributed to Satchin
1566.196,and the work that he's done.
1568.21,"There are others involved too, of course."
1570.585,"And of course, time-restricted feeding"
1572.76,and fasting has a rich history
that,"goes back many hundreds,"
1575.787,if not thousands of years
in,different cultures
1577.821,"and religions,"
1579.35,but the science of time-restricted
feeding,can really mainly
1582.69,be attributed to the incredible
work,that Satchin has done.
1585.306,And I'm grateful to consider
him,"a friend and a colleague,"
1589.6,and we consulted at length in
anticipation,of this episode.
1592.55,I also hope to have him on
as,a guest in the future.
1595.2,The landmark paper that
came,from Satchin's lab
1597.81,was published in 2012.
1599.163,This was a paper in
mice,that set the basis
1602.027,for studies in humans that came later.
1605.01,And the title of this paper
is,time-restricted feeding
1608.01,"without reducing caloric intake,"
1610.42,prevents metabolic diseases
in,mice fed a high fat diet.
1614.062,So the title tells us a lot.
1616.52,It says that what's varied in this study
1619.35,"is not what these mice ate,"
it,was when they ate it.
1622.723,And there were essentially four conditions
1625.9,in this study and the results
are,absolutely remarkable.
1629.093,So I'm going to walk you
through,the major results.
1631.824,What they did is they gave mice access
1635.221,to different types of food.
1636.955,"There were four groups,"
1638.87,one group of mice had access
to,just a normal mouse diet.
1643.49,It would not be a diet that
you'd,be very interested in.
1645.284,I confess I've actually tasted mouse chow.
1647.334,If you work with mice at
"all,",you just have to do it.
1649.69,"At least once it doesn't taste very good,"
1651.51,it tastes like a very bland
Graham,cracker cookie.
1653.66,And I confessed that. I only
had,"the tiniest little bit,"
1655.28,but mice like that stuff.
1656.541,"And if you allow them to eat that stuff,"
1659.4,what's called ad libitum
whenever,"they want,"
1661.58,you just keep it in their
food.,"24 hours a day,"
1664.02,"they will eat sometimes,"
1665.24,and then they won't eat it at
other,"times, or in this case,"
1668.87,they also had a condition where
they,gave them mouse chow in
1671.67,"a time restricted way,"
1672.88,just for a certain
number,"of hours each day,"
1675.831,"but about eight hours, or they"
gave,them a high-fat diet.
1681.41,"That was a separate group,"
1682.32,got a high-fat diet at
any,time they wanted.
1684.85,So this was kind of the
carnival,for mice because mice
1686.734,"really like high fat,"
highly,palatable foods.
1689.69,And so they got a lot of
goodies,and high-fat in their
1691.949,food.
1692.95,And then there was a fourth
group,that had access to the
1695.53,high fat diet as much
as,"they wanted to eat,"
1697.95,but only during a restricted
time,period of each 24 hour
1701.87,"cycle, now mice are nocturnal."
1703.57,"Humans are what we call diurnal, actually,"
1705.423,we're not really diurnal
we're,"crepuscular,"
1708.37,which means that we're most
active,in the morning and in the
1710.87,"evening, not so much in the"
"afternoon,","but nonetheless,"
1714.322,everything I'm going to tell
you,is true also for humans.
1719.21,"And we know this now from human studies,"
1720.624,one of the most important
things,to take away from this
1722.783,study was that mice that ate
a,highly palatable high-fat
1726.688,"diet, a great tasting diet,"
1728.64,but only during a restricted
feeding,window of each 24 hour
1731.11,cycle maintained or lost
weight,"over time, whereas mice"
1736.95,"that ingested the same diet,"
same,"amount of calories,"
1741.116,but had access to those
calories,"around the clock,"
1744.644,"gained weight, became"
obese,and quite sick.
1748.67,"And as an additional second point,"
1750.312,the mice that restricted
their,feeding window to a
1754.15,particular portion of eight
hours,of every 24 hour cycle
1757.686,actually showed some
improvement,in important health
1762.19,markers.
1763.42,And what was even more incredible
is,that mice that only ate
1767.64,"during a particular feeding window,"
1769.264,also experienced some reversal
of,some prior negative health
1774.54,effects.
1775.6,So this study really lit up the
world,and got people excited
1778.61,about time-restricted eating again.
1781.557,They use an eight hour feeding window.
1785.959,The story around that eight
hour,feeding window is kind of
1788.71,interesting though.
1790.703,Not many people know this
because,it wasn't included in the
1792.62,"paper, and there was no reason"
to,"include it in the paper,"
1796.322,"not to out anybody,"
1798.02,but it turns out that the
reason,they used an eight hour
1800.71,feeding window and not a nine
hour,or a 10 hour feeding
1803.81,"window,"
1804.643,is because studies of this sort
are,actually quite demanding
1808.98,to perform and require the
constant,presence of the graduate
1812.95,"student,"
1813.783,or post-doc there to ensure
that,the food is in the cages at
1816.541,particular times and not in
the,cages at other times.
1820.29,And mice are really good at hiding food.
1822.13,They'll even hide food in their jowls.
1824.51,And so there's a lot of work
that,has to be done to prepare
1827.93,for that eight hour feeding window.
1829.65,And to make sure after that
eight,"hour feeding window,"
1831.962,there's all the food has been
removed,from the cage and from
1835.33,the jowls of the mice and so forth.
1837.12,And it turns out that the
significant,other of the graduate
1840.54,"student and or postdoc,"
1842.45,I won't reveal who they were running.
1844.17,"This study forbid their significant other,"
1847.88,the scientist from being in
the,"lab for periods of time,"
1852.1,that were much longer than
the,10 or 12 hours that were
1854.55,required in order to ensure
this,eight hour feeding window.
1857.772,So when we hear the eight
hour,"feeding windows are holy,"
1861.16,"they are not holy and later,"
1862.547,we are going to talk about
how,eating for a time that's
1866.73,restricted to eight hours
versus,10 hours versus 12 hours.
1869.524,"For instance,"
1870.554,how that impacts various
parameters,like health parameters
1873.204,"and weight loss, et cetera."
1875.34,But the eight hour feeding
window,was actually created
1877.465,because of a real world
constraint,on the research and the
1880.48,relationship with the researcher
performing,"the research,"
1882.507,not because there's anything
holy,about an eight hour
1885.217,"feeding window, now"
1886.67,an important point about
when,the feeding window falls
1889.532,"within the 24 hour cycle,"
1891.328,it is very important that the
feeding,window fall during the
1895.322,more active phase of
one's,"day, so for humans,"
1899.369,that's typically in the early
part,of the day or the later
1903.55,"part of the day,"
1904.383,"but not at night, put very simply,"
1906.403,there are a lot of data now
1908.151,pointing to the fact that eating
during,the nocturnal phase
1912.587,of the 24 hour cycle is very
detrimental,to one's health.
1917.555,"In fact,"
1918.685,when we eat can either enhance
our,health or can diminish
1922.92,our health.
1924.234,When we see light can enhance
our,feelings of wellbeing or
1928.135,can diminish our feelings of wellbeing.
1930.59,"I've talked many times before about this,"
1932.2,"on the human lab podcast,"
that,"during the daytime,"
1934.021,you want to get as much sunlight
and,other types of bright
1937.37,light in your eyes as safely possible.
1938.716,And then you want to avoid light
in,the middle of the night.
1942.029,It has detrimental dopamine
lowering,effects can cause
1944.946,"depression, cortisol increases, et cetera."
1947.88,So when you view light is as
important,as the light that you
1950.576,view.
1952.11,And when you eat is as important
as,"what you eat, in this"
1956.325,"study, they saw something"
really,"interesting,"
1960.107,which was that not only did
restricting,food to a particular
1964.5,"phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit,"
1966.174,things like lean body mass
and,fat loss and a number of
1971.59,health parameters that we'll
talk,"about in a moment,"
1973.88,but it also anchored all the
gene,systems of the body and
1977.127,provided a more regular stable
so-called,circadian rhythm or
1981.89,"24 hour rhythm, you may be"
surprised,"to learn that 80%,"
1985.671,80% of the genes in your
body,and brain are on a 24
1992.006,hour schedule.
1993.87,That is they change their levels
going,from high to low and
1996.809,"back to high again,"
across,the 24 hour cycle.
1999.94,And when those genes are high
at,the appropriate times and
2002.9,"low at the appropriate times,"
2004.25,meaning their expression is
high,and low at the appropriate
2007.22,times.
2008.12,And therefore the proper RNAs
and,proteins are made because
2011.56,"DNA codes for RNA, RNA is"
translated,into proteins.
2016.66,"When that happens, your health benefits,"
2019.42,when those genes are not
expressed,at the right times when
2022.756,they're higher or low at the
wrong,times of each 24 hour
2026.24,"cycle, that's when you get"
negative,health effects.
2028.818,This study showed that when
mice,restrict their eating to an
2032.61,eight hour period within the
most,active phase of their 24
2036.75,"hour cycle,"
2038.002,many of the genes that are
associated,with these so-called
2041.1,"circadian clocks, these genes"
have,"names like PER, BMAL,"
2044.255,"CRY1, et cetera,"
2046.67,those so-called clock genes
underwent,a very regular
2050.493,"entrainment, a locking in to"
the,proper 24 hour schedule.
2055.27,"And while this was in mice,"
2056.264,we now know that this
also,"occurs in humans,"
2059.17,I've said before on this
"podcast,","and I'll say it again,"
2061.878,"that light,"
2063.02,and when we view light is the
primary,way in which these
2065.85,genes and the clock systems
of,our body get organized or
2069.09,"entrained, meaning matched to"
the,outside light dark cycle.
2072.32,So viewing light early in
the,"day and in the afternoon,"
2074.78,"and as much as possible all day, great,"
2076.58,"ideally that sunlight, avoiding"
light,in the middle of the
2079.41,night is also great.
2081.357,It's great because it causes
the,increases in particular
2086.18,genes and the decreases in
particular,genes in every cell
2088.62,throughout your body at
the,"appropriate times,"
2090.394,the second most powerful
timekeeper,"or zeitgeber, as it's"
2094.71,"called, is food, and when"
you,"eat, and in this study,"
2100.221,the results they saw
underscore,"this point,"
2103.21,what they saw is that the peaks
in,these clock genes became
2106.239,very regular.
2107.83,And the dips in these clock
genes,became very regular.
2110.61,And that led to a whole
host,"of really important,"
2113.867,positive health effects.
2116.099,"Conversely, when mice ate,"
2118.387,whenever they wanted
across,"the 24 hour cycle,"
2120.669,these clock genes became
really,out of whack and the
2123.929,negative health consequences
were,the downstream result of
2128.367,these changes in these clock genes.
2131.787,This is now also been shown
to,be true for humans.
2135.14,"So if you want to be healthy,"
you,"want your organ health,"
2138.13,your metabolic health to
be,in trained properly.
2141.846,One of the most important
things,"you can do is to,"
2143.47,if you lied at the appropriate
times,of each 24 hour
2146.05,schedule and to not view
light,at other times of that
2148.38,schedule and to eat at the
appropriate,time of each 24 hour
2152.04,day.
2153.76,"Now, again,"
2154.593,there are rare instances that
we,will discuss when skipping
2157.079,entire days or entire 24
hour,cycles of eating can be
2160.595,beneficial.
2161.99,But for now we're talking
about,schedules of time
2164.83,restricted
2165.663,feeding involve a window of
feeding,that falls during
2168.55,"your more active phase,"
so,"during the daytime,"
2170.79,putting aside people that work
shift,work during the daytime
2173.923,is when you want to eat.
2175.503,And this eight hour feeding
window,provided a very strong
2179.593,reinforcing signal that combines
with,light to ensure that
2184.25,these genes are expressed
at,the appropriate times.
2186.555,The short takeaway from this
is,you probably want to think
2189.883,about and perhaps even engage
in,"time, restricted feeding."
2194.29,"So, as I mentioned earlier,"
2195.35,when mice can eat around the
"clock,",bad things happen.
2198.42,And one of the bad things
that,happens is that the liver
2201.27,"suffers, the liver is involved"
in,"all sorts of things,"
2205.3,production of important hormones
and,other factors related
2207.283,to metabolism.
2209.01,"And when mice can eat around the clock,"
2211.442,"their livers got very sick,"
fatty,deposits in the liver.
2214.553,Other factors in the liver
essentially,taken down the
2218.05,"pathway of liver disease,"
the,"time restricted feeding,"
2221.341,essentially reversed that or
led,in many cases to an even
2224.815,"healthier liver conditions,"
and,"that's based on this study,"
2227.262,but also additional
studies,also now in humans.
2230.531,So restricting your feeding
to,"a particular window,"
2234.24,every 24 hour cycle has clearly
been,shown now in mice and
2237.71,in humans to enhance liver
"health,",which is wonderful.
2242.234,"How does it do this, well, it"
happens,"because food intake,"
2247.58,"as I mentioned earlier,"
2248.52,sets certain conditions in the
body,that lasts for a period
2251.66,of time.
2252.8,"Anytime we eat,"
2253.93,whether or not we are a
mouse,"or a human, there's"
2255.671,a period of time that's required
for,"so-called digestion,"
2259.86,but also gastric emptying and
other,processes related to
2263.052,breaking down that food and utilizing it.
2265.7,And that is an active
process.,It requires energy.
2268.759,And that process of breaking
down,food involves certain
2274.69,cellular functions that if
they're,ongoing throughout the 24
2279.02,hour cycle or even extended
too,far across the 24 hour
2282.743,"cycle, meaning you're eating"
across,"a 14 or a 16 hour,"
2286.329,"an 18 hour window, that"
causes,serious problems.
2290.18,And this is now been established
because,of the fact that it
2293.773,increases the expression of
different,proteins and genes in
2298.1,"the body, as such as"
TNF,"alpha, IL-6, IL-1."
2301.07,what are all those things?
2302.3,They are pro-inflammatory markers.
2304.54,So the reason that the liver
gets,sick when you're eating
2306.836,too often is because inflammatory
markers,are increased.
2310.67,These inflammatory markers
are,"not inherently bad,"
2314.17,"they're there for a reason,"
2315.171,but they are there in
order,to respond to certain
2318.47,"challenges, immune challenges,"
2320.208,or the ingestion of food
and,the breakdown of food.
2322.93,"But then in an ideal circumstance,"
2325.93,they are reduced in the period
in,which there's no food
2329.418,present in the digestive
tract,or in which there's very
2332.11,little food present in
the,digestive tract.
2334.43,"So by eating around the clock,"
2335.595,you're making yourself sicker
by,eating at restricted
2339.07,"periods of time, each 24 hours a day,"
2341.09,you're actually making
yourself,healthier and you're
2343.87,activating certain processes
that,can positively impact both
2348.174,"weight, either maintenance"
or,loss of weight.
2351.75,We'll talk about weight gain
a,little later and positively
2354.59,impacting things like liver health.
2356.06,Also the expression of different
things,related to brown
2358.755,"fat, the fat that"
increases,your metabolism.
2361.81,We will return to this also
a,little bit later and blood
2364.843,"glucose regulation, so the"
takeaway,"from this study,"
2369.126,"in fact, there are many"
takeaways,from the study.
2371.15,"It's so wonderful is that liver health,"
2374.844,"bile acid metabolism, energy"
expenditure,"inflammation,"
2379.566,"liver metabolites, many,"
2383.0,many aspects of our health
are,"impacted by when we eat,"
2386.66,"not just what we eat, as we move forward,"
2389.23,and we talk about intermittent
fasting,for eight hour
2391.779,"windows, six hour windows,"
2393.49,12 hour windows for all sorts
of,different intents and
2396.69,purposes.
2397.72,I want to start to establish
a,foundational protocol that
2401.153,"all of us,"
2402.56,any of us can use in order
to,maximize your particular
2405.463,goals.
2407.061,There are some absolutes
within,this realm of
2410.48,time-restricted feeding.
2412.475,Here are a couple of absolutes
that,you would want to
2415.07,"consider, first of all,"
2418.29,it pays off in the metabolic
sense,and in the health sense
2422.017,and in the weight maintenance
or,loss sense to not ingest
2427.081,any food in the first hour
after,waking and potentially for
2432.44,"longer, so I want to repeat that."
2433.93,One of the key pillars of
intermittent,fasting is that for
2436.717,the first hour
2438.17,after you wake up and potentially
for,longer to not ingest
2441.13,"any food, okay,"
2443.503,the second major pillar that's
well,supported by research is
2447.12,that for the two and ideally
three,"hours prior to bedtime,"
2452.385,you also don't ingest any food
or,liquid calories for that
2457.24,matter.
2458.073,And we will talk about what
it,means to break a fast and
2460.357,"whether or not certain liquids,"
2462.41,even coffee and tea can
break,"a fast, et cetera,"
2464.73,"in a few moments, but"
just,"as a foundation,"
2468.128,it's very clear from the research
in,humans that not eating
2471.429,any food or ingesting any
calories,liquid or otherwise for
2475.259,the first 60 minutes
after,waking up each day.
2478.859,And for the two to three
hours,"prior to your bedtime,"
2483.87,that's ideal for the
parameters,that we've discussed
2487.22,"earlier,"
2488.053,all the different things like
weight,and liver health and
2490.26,metabolic health and so forth.
2491.962,The two most common questions
about,intermittent fasting are
2494.693,when is the ideal time
for,the eating window?
2498.08,"Is it early in the day,"
2498.913,the middle of the day or later in the day?
2501.16,And how long should that eating window be?
2503.94,Should it be eight hours?
2504.866,We already heard why the
eight,hour window was first
2507.76,established.
2508.75,It was because of these lab
conditions,and the conditions of
2511.09,the particular relationship
of,the graduate student
2513.25,"involved,"
2514.083,or should it be seven hours
or,six hours or 12 hours.
2516.33,It turns out that there's some
general,frameworks that we
2520.22,can follow in order to
answer,these questions.
2522.377,As we move into this
portion,"of the discussion,"
2524.516,I want to highlight a very
important,reference that just
2527.759,"came out,"
2529.35,literally came out last week
in,the journal endocrinology
2532.93,reviews.
2534.06,And the title of this review
is,time-restricted eating for
2537.12,the prevention and management
of,metabolic diseases.
2539.762,Although the data in this
paper,go well beyond metabolic
2544.61,"diseases, this is a paper"
from,Satchin Panda's lab.
2547.89,It's a very lengthy review
with,an enormous table
2551.57,that's beautifully organized
that,scripts out all the
2555.52,studies done in humans.
2557.126,Well over a hundred
studies,"looking at time,"
2560.26,restricted feeding in
"athletes,","men, women, children,"
2562.818,"diabetes, no diabetes, et cetera,"
2565.067,with detailed references and
description,of the outcomes.
2568.302,"I've spent a lot of time with this review,"
2570.46,even though it just came out
recently,and is a absolute
2572.895,goldmine resource.
2574.547,It is also the major resource
for,everything I'm about to
2577.49,tell you if you would like
to,delve deeper into the
2579.176,material.
2580.182,So let's deal with this first
question,of when is the ideal
2584.29,"feeding window, and here again,"
2586.23,we're thinking about a schedule
of,eating that involves
2589.56,"eating at least once every 24 hours,"
2591.777,not two day or three day
or,every other day fast.
2595.534,So it turns out that the
answer,"to the question,"
2598.64,when is it best to eat is
actually,best answered by thinking
2602.197,"about the other side of the coin,"
2604.3,which is when is it best to fast?
2606.797,"So, because we are fasting during sleep,"
2609.973,it's very clear that it's best
to,extend the sleep-related
2614.73,fast either into the morning
or,to start it in the evening.
2620.485,"Now this might seem kind of obvious,"
2622.58,but it's actually not so obvious.
2624.494,You could place that feeding
window,"early in the day,"
2628.5,middle of the day or late in the day.
2630.09,Let's think about what happens
when,"we sleep, when we sleep,"
2633.651,our body undergoes a number
of,different processes in the
2637.37,brain and body in order to
recover,the cells and tissues.
2641.049,Many of you have probably
heard,"of autophagic,"
2643.17,which is essentially a cleaning
up,a gobbling up of dead
2646.25,cells and cells that are injured or sick.
2649.54,"And this is a natural process that occurs,"
2651.143,and it occurs mainly during sleep.
2653.51,"Although not only during sleep,"
2656.779,fasting of any kind does tend
2659.388,to enhance autophagy.
2661.42,It is not the only way to
create,autophagic conditions.
2665.83,Autophagic conditions can be
created,simply by following a
2669.38,sub caloric diet.
2670.71,And there are other things
that,one can do in order to
2672.919,"trigger autophagy, but fasting"
does,trigger autophagy.
2676.84,"So when we're asleep,"
2678.29,the bad cells are getting
gobbled,up and eaten.
2680.399,And the good cells also are
undergoing,certain repair
2684.59,"mechanisms mainly related to,"
2686.46,or at least governed by those
circadian,genes that we talked
2689.33,"about earlier, those clock genes."
2690.818,So you're already fasting when
you're,asleep and how deep
2695.769,you are into that fast depends
on,how long it was since your
2698.516,last meal.
2700.382,"So if you fast early in the day,"
2703.622,and you've been asleep
for,"5, 6, 7, 8 hours,"
2708.42,I would hope somewhere between
six,and eight hours for most
2710.73,people is going to be beneficial.
2712.181,"When you wake up,"
2714.217,I mentioned earlier that you
don't,want to eat for at least
2717.27,"the first 60 minutes after waking,"
2719.24,but were you to extend
that,"fasting to say,"
2721.724,"9:00 AM 10:00 AM,"
2723.98,11:00 AM or even 12 noon or
later,you are taking advantage
2728.128,"of the deep, fast that"
you,were in during sleep.
2731.95,And certainly toward
the,"end of sleep, now,"
2733.72,"why do I say deep, fast?"
2734.96,"Well,"
2736.619,because when we eat the clearance
of,that food from our gut
2740.157,and the processes in our cells
and,organs that are related
2744.38,"to digestion,"
2746.34,and the utilization of that
food,takes about five to six
2750.53,"hours, so if you eat a meal"
and,"that meal lasts 10 minutes,"
2755.72,"20 minutes or 30 minutes, or even an hour,"
2757.629,"and then you stop eating,"
you've,"stopped eating,"
2760.54,but you are not fasting at that point.
2763.24,You can say you're fasting
because,you're no longer putting
2765.22,"food into your digestive tract,"
2766.862,but you're not in a fasted state.
2769.51,You are not under conditions
of,"fasting, later,"
2772.77,I'll talk about things that
you,can do to accelerate the
2774.68,transition into fasting.
2775.864,"So one thing is certain, that"
you,want your eating window to
2779.809,be tacked or attached to your
sleep,based fasting in a way
2785.745,that makes it easier for you
to,get into the fasted state
2789.462,for a period of time.
2791.33,So we can view that point
from,"the perspective of best,"
2796.138,"better and worst, okay?"
2798.944,So if you are like most
people,"and you sleep at night,"
2802.059,you're waking up somewhere
around,"6:30, 7:00 AM,"
2804.268,or maybe even 8:00 AM.
2805.95,Let's say you were to push
your,"fasting window out,"
2808.405,"such that you started eating at noon,"
2812.87,and then you stopped eating at 6:00 PM.
2816.716,"Well,"
2817.98,then you're not eating from
6:00,PM until let's say your
2821.82,"bedtime is 10:00 PM, but"
from,"6:00 PM to 10:00 PM,"
2824.63,your body is not yet in a fasted
state,because you just ate.
2827.792,"However,"
2829.872,you're starting to taper into
a,fastest state before sleep
2832.873,and then all through sleep.
2835.04,And until the next
morning,"and late morning,"
2836.878,"you are actually in a fasted state, now,"
2840.3,most people find it very hard
to,only eat in the middle of
2842.243,"the day, so while that's best,"
2845.081,it's ideal for sake of the fasting
2847.7,"related improvements in health,"
2849.484,it is not ideal.
2851.06,And it's not very applicable
to,most work and family and
2855.44,social situations.
2856.481,"Most people eat breakfast with others and,"
2859.68,or eat dinner with others.
2861.147,Some people eat lunch with
"others,","but in general,"
2864.337,it's hard to restrict your
feeding,window to just the
2866.586,"absolute middle of the day,"
2868.38,"but from a purely health perspective,"
2870.53,"in a very objective way, that"
would,be the ideal situation.
2873.463,Let's imagine a different
pattern,of eating where the
2876.84,feeding window starts in the
afternoon,starts around two or
2880.84,even 3:00 PM.
2882.12,Some people don't have much
trouble,or they can train
2884.2,themselves to get their
feeding,window out to two or
2887.138,"3:00 PM, and then they won't"
eat,until 10 or 11:00 PM.
2891.32,"Right, if you do the math,"
2892.29,you realize that that feeding
window,is still pretty short.
2894.72,It still constitutes what we
would,call intermittent fasting
2897.6,or time restricted feeding.
2898.708,But assuming that they go
to,bed around 11:00 PM or
2902.22,"midnight,"
2903.73,they are not actually fasted
in,sleep because for the first
2907.759,"six hours or so of sleep, maybe five,"
2910.96,"but probably more like six hours of sleep,"
2912.44,they're still digesting the
food,that they consumed a late
2914.724,in the night.
2916.163,It does appear beneficial
to,grab a hold of that
2921.681,"sleep-related fast,"
2924.02,meaning you don't want your
feeding,window to be too close
2928.26,to bedtime.
2929.093,And that's why we came up
with,this kind of foundational
2931.48,pillar that I discussed
with,"such an earlier,"
2933.91,which is at least no eating for
the,"first hour after waking,"
2936.666,but also no eating within two
to,three hours prior to bed.
2941.71,And because we all need to
sleep,and sleep is seemingly
2943.616,important for our health of all kinds.
2946.627,"You want to prioritize sleep,"
2948.78,"but because we also have to eat,"
2950.133,then you start to think about
this,and maybe it's not so
2953.34,good to push that feeding
window,"too late in the day,"
2956.29,"because when you go to sleep,"
2957.81,you're not actually capitalizing
on,the sleep related
2959.994,fasting.
2961.26,Now it's not just the case
that,it's easiest to fast while
2964.31,"in sleep, although that's true"
because,"when we're asleep,"
2966.58,typically we're not hungry or
looking,for food or foraging
2969.49,for food or wanting food
or,trying to resist food.
2971.367,We're just sleeping.
2973.305,There is something special
about,the fasting that occurs
2976.73,"during sleep,"
2977.83,because it's associated with
a,number of processes that
2980.453,"relate to the so-called lymphatic system,"
2983.45,the movement of lymph like
fluids,and other fluids through
2986.94,"the brain, and kind of sweeping"
out,"a garbage disposal,"
2990.11,"if you will,"
2990.943,a clearing out of the metabolic
debris,and some of the
2993.67,autophagy that's associated
with,bad processes in the brain.
2998.059,"So we could do a whole episode on this,"
3000.34,but essentially during
"sleep,","and in particular,"
3002.41,"during fasted states of sleep,"
3004.471,we are undergoing a number
of,automatic seller processes
3009.048,that clear out debris from
our,"brain enhance cognition,"
3013.31,or at least offset dementia.
3014.72,This is now well-established
as,well as a number of the same
3017.43,processes occurring in
the,organs of our body.
3019.9,So what we're starting to
see,here is that there are a
3022.63,number of constraints on
when,"you can eat, now,"
3024.842,I would be remiss if I
didn't,acknowledge the social
3028.04,constraints and the real
life,"constraints, some of us,"
3030.198,because we want to eat with
our,family and because our
3034.07,family or our significant
others,eat around eight or
3036.59,"9:00 PM, and that's the"
only,"time we're together,"
3038.36,You have to eat late in the day.
3040.61,And that certainly not a sin.
3041.93,"I'm not saying that's good or bad, here"
3043.407,we're trying to establish
if,"you recall, best, better,"
3046.95,and worst.
3048.08,So from both a practical and
a,health perspective and a
3052.34,purely objective view of how
intermittent,fasting works and
3055.507,"can benefit us, starting to eat each day,"
3060.45,"somewhere around 10:00 AM or around noon,"
3064.515,and then allowing a feeding
window,that goes until six or
3068.982,maybe 8:00 PM.
3071.034,"That seems to me,"
3073.156,at least based on the data
and,what I understand about
3075.662,"typical cultures,"
3077.12,where people eat in the
daytime,"and in the evening,"
3081.093,that seems to me like the kind
of,schedule that will allow
3084.96,you to get the most out
of,"intermittent fasting,"
3087.326,"time-restricted feeding,"
3089.432,but does not set you up to be
really,out of sync with the
3093.32,social rhythms in most cultures.
3095.813,If you think about it from the
perspective,of say a noon to
3099.67,"eight feeding window,"
3101.59,what you'll find is that
you're,able to eat lunch with
3104.66,others.
3105.77,"If you like, or by yourself,"
3107.03,you will be able to eat
dinner,"at a reasonable hour,"
3109.726,"at least in most countries,"
in,"most cultures,"
3111.911,eating dinner somewhere
between,6:30 and 7:00 PM is
3116.788,typical.
3119.15,When you say a feeding
"window,",that goes until eight.
3121.37,That doesn't mean sitting
down,to dinner at eight.
3123.97,That means your last bite of
food,or ingestion of any liquid
3126.77,calories was at 8:00 PM.
3129.099,Assuming that you go to bed
somewhere,between 10:00 PM and
3132.62,"1:00 AM that allows this tapering off,"
3134.95,or this transition from
feeding,"to a fasted state,"
3138.44,and still allows you to capitalize
on,the special period of
3142.09,fasting that is sleep-related fasting.
3144.92,"And again,"
3145.753,I want to emphasize that the
fasting,that occurs during
3147.39,sleep is vital and eating too
close,to sleep will disrupt
3150.227,that fasting related sleep.
3153.215,"Now,"
3154.048,there are a number of caveats
and,"details related to this,"
3156.541,and there's an important caveat
in,detail related to people
3160.699,that are specifically
interested,in increasing or
3164.747,maintaining muscle mass.
3166.298,So first let's talk about food
volume,and food type and how
3171.217,that relates to whether or not
you,quickly or slowly enter a
3176.551,fasted state.
3178.23,Because clearly when we
talk,"about a feeding window,"
3181.056,that feeding window could
include,any number of different
3183.81,"foods, it could involve"
cake,"and ice cream, pizza,"
3186.02,"hamburgers, plants, fruit, whatever it is,"
3189.242,or it could involve just fats
or,"just proteins, et cetera."
3193.197,There are at least three
factors,that are going to govern
3196.529,how quickly you transition
from,ingesting food to a fasted
3201.064,"state, remember,"
3202.383,as you ingest your last
bite,"or sip of calories,"
3206.396,that's not when the fast begins.
3208.49,That might be when the fastening
begins,on your watch or on
3211.133,one of these apps that
I'll,"refer to later,"
3213.25,which can help you track your
fasting,and eating windows.
3215.375,But that's not when it actually
begins,because your body is
3218.472,still seeing food.
3220.22,You're actually carrying
around,"food inside of you,"
3223.15,even though you're not
putting,"into your mouth,"
3224.813,you're still eating in some sense.
3228.0,So it should be somewhat obvious
that,very large meals are
3230.979,going to take longer to
digest,than very small meals.
3233.78,So that will impact how slowly
or,quickly you migrate from a
3237.929,fed state to a fasted state.
3241.082,There's no way I can spell out
what,exact volume of food you
3244.779,should ingest based on the
size,of your stomach and et
3247.68,"cetera, but you're all familiar"
with,"being extremely full,"
3251.55,"very full, comfortably"
"full,","somewhat full,"
3255.15,or not feeling full and feeling hungry.
3257.636,So learning to gauge
food,volume is important.
3260.922,Also foods that include some
fats,or a lot of fats will tend
3266.24,to slow gastric emptying time.
3268.019,"And depending on the kind of fats,"
3271.01,it could mean that a given
meal,is digested within three
3274.37,hours versus five hours.
3275.417,And more fats might be a large
meal,with a lot of fats has
3278.57,"been, can take five or six hours."
3279.96,A smaller meal with less fat
is,going to be digested more
3282.3,quickly consuming calories in
liquid,form is going to mean
3285.426,that gastric emptying time
is,going to be faster.
3287.868,"And then of course,"
3289.3,there's the glucose and
the,"insulin aspect to it,"
3292.01,which is that foods that lead
to,big steep rises in glucose
3295.051,like pure sugars.
3296.919,"Then your glucose will drop, however,"
3299.55,"if they're combined with fats,"
3300.86,then it tends to be a more
gradual,rise in glucose and it's
3303.16,"more sustained, et cetera."
3304.58,Fibrous foods will also create
a,more long lasting sustained
3307.714,release in glucose.
3311.027,The important thing here is
to,establish a feeding window
3314.23,"that you can comfortably manage, okay?"
3317.33,"Meaning that on average,"
3318.83,you can obey a six hour
feeding,window or an eight hour
3322.6,feeding window or a 10
hour,feeding window.
3324.83,And then to place that feeding
window,in a social and life
3329.15,context that you can manage
on,"a regular basis, now,"
3332.68,there are two key points that
have,been gleaned from the
3335.33,scientific data about this
feeding,window and when to place
3338.286,it.
3339.37,And this is based on a
really,important experiment
3342.16,that Satchin and his
colleagues,have been doing.
3344.13,There's a website that they
have,zero-cost website called My
3347.28,"Circadian Clock, you can go"
to,this website free of cost.
3350.461,There are a number of
important,"resources there,"
3352.7,but what they've done is
they've,examined the feeding
3355.68,behavior of thousands of people.
3358.382,People will take a picture of
the,"food they're about to eat,"
3360.685,and it enters into their
"account,","maybe your account,"
3363.86,if you create one on My
Circadian,"Clock, and they do this"
3366.47,"over many days or weeks,"
3368.74,what's great about this is it establishes
3371.459,what's essentially called a
fetal,gram a time in which
3375.35,people ate.
3376.56,And a number of important
findings,have emerged from these
3379.413,"fetal grams, across large"
populations,"of people,"
3382.646,different time zones with
different,"schedules, et cetera."
3385.51,"First of all,"
3386.949,almost everybody underestimates
their,feeding window.
3391.08,Meaning people who think that
they,are on an eight hour
3394.219,feeding window or six hour
feeding,"window, when their data"
3399.112,"are analyzed,"
3401.05,it almost is always the case
that,they're actually on a
3403.24,feeding window
3404.073,that's one or even two hours
longer,than they think you
3406.217,"think, well,"
3407.27,how could that possibly be if
people,are taking their first
3409.38,bite at noon and they're taking
their,last bite at 8:00 PM?
3413.073,"Well,"
3414.27,that must mean that they are
on,that feeding window of eight
3417.49,hours.
3418.4,"And it turns out that people cheat,"
3421.64,but they don't cheat in
any,kind of obvious way.
3423.48,"They might have, you know, a"
glass,"of wine after dinner,"
3425.989,or they'll have a cup of tea
and,a little bite of a cookie.
3428.7,And so when people are
honest,"and they are honest,"
3430.81,"in most cases for this experiment,"
3433.442,what you find is that most
people's,eating window is
3436.16,actually quite a bit longer.
3438.203,So in discussing this with
such,in and reviewing the
3439.33,"literature,"
3440.61,it's clear that if you'd like
to,be on a 10 hour feeding
3444.97,"window,"
3446.01,that you should probably
select,an eight hour feeding
3448.42,"window,"
3449.253,because there's always a
little,bit of a taper on either
3452.87,side of that eating window.
3454.22,Very few people are extremely
strict,about these eating
3456.986,windows.
3457.819,It's just hard to do in the
context,of life events and
3459.444,"social gatherings and,"
and,family and so forth.
3462.758,"Okay, so as we build forward,"
3464.71,your ideal fasting slash
time-restricted,"feeding schedule,"
3469.86,we now have several different
rules,that we can list out
3472.441,"first,"
3473.66,at least no food for the first
hour,after waking up at least
3477.345,"one hour, two, no food intake"
3482.36,for two and ideally three hours
3484.55,prior to your bedtime.
3486.724,"Three, if you want to select"
an,"eight hour feeding window,"
3492.475,then you should probably
focus,on a six or seven hour
3495.75,"feeding window because in reality,"
3497.135,your feeding window is
going,"to be longer reality,"
3499.893,meaning real life constraints.
3502.447,And if you'd like to be on
a,"10 hour feeding window,"
3505.212,you should probably select an
eight,or a nine hour feeding
3508.14,"window,"
3508.973,because the way it plays out
is,that people almost always
3511.09,eat outside of their
eating,"window, somewhat."
3514.64,The other nice thing about
selecting,a slightly shorter
3516.849,eating window than is comfortable
for,you is that it takes
3520.77,into account that as you take
your,last bite or your last
3525.4,"sip of calories, there's"
this,"time or taper before,"
3529.315,which you are actually in a fasted state.
3531.675,And because you're eating
different,things on different
3534.16,"days, presumably some foods"
leave,your gut more quickly.
3537.139,Some things spike your insulin
and,your glucose more than
3539.539,others.
3540.546,Sometimes you eat more
"fat,",sometimes less fat.
3544.022,This allows you to fall well
within,the margins of the
3547.607,benefits of time-restricted
feeding,that had been
3550.6,"demonstrated in humans,"
3551.93,which generally involve an
eight,hour window or so.
3555.654,So I think this eight hour
window,or six hour window is a
3559.414,good thing to shoot for
most,"people, some people,"
3562.418,"and we will discuss the exceptions,"
3564.54,but some people truly
are,exceptions to this.
3566.466,They just require more food.
3568.965,"And along those lines,"
3570.69,I just now briefly want to touch
on,some of the studies that
3572.91,have looked at using a very
short,feeding window of about
3575.51,"four hours, nowadays,"
3577.34,a number of people are doing
the,"so-called one meal per day,"
3580.02,or are restricting their feeding
window,to just four hours
3583.7,or six hours.
3584.533,And that turns out to be an
interesting,strategy and the
3587.706,data around it actually are
a,little bit surprising.
3591.37,One surprising thing to leap
out,of this massive literature
3594.348,review on time
3596.48,restricted feeding in humans
is,that relatively short
3600.71,feeding windows of say four to
six,hours do produce a number
3604.41,of positive health effects.
3605.793,"Things like increased insulin sensitivity,"
3607.975,"which we know is good, remember type two"
3610.21,diabetes is a reduction in
insulin,sensitivity improvements
3613.32,in beta cell function and
the,pancreas decreased blood
3617.118,"pressure,"
3618.13,decreased oxidative stress
decreases,in things like evening
3622.928,appetite.
3624.14,So positive health effects
and,psychological facts in
3627.39,general.
3628.6,"However, they either produce"
no,"change in body weight,"
3632.657,or they tend to produce even
increases,"in body weight, now,"
3637.87,of course there's variation
between,individuals and between
3641.1,"studies, but this is somewhat surprising."
3643.284,So the eight hour feeding window
seems,to be very beneficial
3646.086,across almost all the
parameters,"that we've discussed,"
3649.672,"inflammation, weight,"
"loss,","fat loss, et cetera,"
3652.171,and adherence.
3654.34,I should mention people's ability
to,stick to the diet seems
3656.598,quite good on this eight
hour,"feeding windows,"
3659.555,but when people try and undergo
very,short feeding windows
3662.51,"of four to six hours,"
3664.109,it seems that they are overeating
in,"that four to six hours,"
3667.73,at least overeating with respect
to,their metabolic needs.
3671.793,"Now,"
3674.215,the contrast to this is the
so-called,a one meal per day
3677.227,"schedule, very few studies"
on,"one meal per day,"
3680.375,"one meal per day, unless"
it's,"a very, very long meal,"
3683.15,a sort of feast typically would
not,last four to six hours
3686.273,because it sort of depends
on,how you define a meal.
3688.547,But when you look at the
very,"few, I should emphasize,"
3691.89,"again, very few studies"
on,one meal per day.
3693.602,People typically maintain or
lose,weight on the one meal per
3697.35,day schedule.
3698.59,So what we can say is that
the,seven to nine hour feeding
3701.361,window produces all of the
major,health benefits of
3705.083,time-restricted feeding
as,well as being pretty
3708.649,straightforward for most people
to,adhere to on a regular
3711.544,"basis and on a regular basis,"
3713.94,turns out to be very important.
3715.17,I'll get back to that point in a moment.
3716.64,Whereas the four to six hour
eating,window doesn't seem to
3719.52,serve people as well as say
a,seven or eight hour eating
3722.38,"window,"
3723.213,simply because people are
overeating,during that eating
3725.46,"window and the one meal per day,"
3727.202,while perhaps ideal for
certain,people's schedules may
3731.14,actually cause people to under-eat.
3733.41,And in some cases that
might,be what people want.
3735.042,They actually want to under-eat.
3736.552,But when we start thinking
about,"in work and in sport,"
3742.31,and when we start considering
hormone,health and hormone
3746.05,"production, fertility,"
3747.354,that's when we can really start
to,look at the seven to nine
3752.012,hour feeding window versus
the,four to six hour feeding
3755.05,window versus the one meal per
day,type feeding window with
3758.238,"some different objectivity,"
3760.65,we can start to look at it
through,a different lens because
3762.69,it turns out that when you
place,the feeding window and how
3766.869,long that feeding window is
actually,will impact a number of
3770.633,"other things in particular hormones,"
3772.449,that can be very important for
a,number of things related to
3776.61,sex and reproduction can be
related,to performance at work
3780.48,performance in athleticism.
3783.76,And there are excellent studies on this.
3785.384,So let's explore those now.
3787.17,So let's talk about some
conditions,where having the feeding
3790.81,window early in the day would
actually,be very beneficial.
3793.735,There was a study that was
published,recently in Cell
3796.93,"Reports, again, Cell Press Journal,"
3798.77,excellent journal peer
"reviewed,","very stringent,"
3802.023,"from Aoyama, et al,"
3803.859,"so this is AOYAMA, et al."
3808.08,This was published just recently
in,"July, 2021 that looked"
3812.253,at the distribution of protein
intake,in different meals
3818.229,delivered either early in
the,day or later in the day.
3822.11,"And I'm summarizing here quite a lot,"
3823.65,but I should mention that this
study,was performed in both
3826.459,"mice and humans, same paper,"
3828.85,mice and humans and involved
hypertrophy,"training,"
3833.13,essentially increasing the
weight,bearing of given limbs to
3838.08,"try and induce hypertrophy,"
3839.162,which is the growth of muscle tissue.
3842.701,It does appear that muscle
tissue,is better able to undergo
3848.73,hypertrophy by virtue of the
fact,that there's better or
3853.504,enhanced protein synthesis
early,"in the day,"
3856.5,because of the expression of
one,of these particular clock
3859.36,"genes called BMAL, BMAL,"
3862.509,BMAL regulates a number of
different,protein synthesis
3866.122,"pathways within muscle cells,"
3868.226,"such that eating protein early in the day,"
3872.33,supports muscle tissue
maintenance,and or growth.
3875.663,"And in this study,"
3877.49,they also looked at the effects
of,supplementing so-called
3879.6,"BCAs branch chain amino acids,"
3881.9,which is popular in bodybuilding
circles,and in strength
3885.176,training circles and BCAs
are,essential components of a
3890.38,"number of different foods,"
but,can also be supplemented.
3893.091,The takeaway of this study
is,pretty straight forward.
3896.13,"However,"
3897.25,the takeaway is if your main
interest,"is maintaining and,"
3900.25,"or building muscle,"
3901.365,then it can be beneficial to
ingest,protein early in the
3905.23,"day, you would still want to obey this,"
3907.898,what we're calling a kind
of,"foundational rule of no,"
3912.47,not eating any food for the
first,hour post waking or at
3915.96,least the first hour post.
3917.258,And the cutoff for when you
would,want to eat protein would
3920.71,be sometime before 10:00 AM.
3922.764,And there I'm averaging
across,a number of different
3925.048,"situations, but in general,"
3928.124,this BMAL expression is such
that,let's say you wake up at
3931.433,7:00 AM.
3932.5,Your main interest is in
hypertrophy,or maintenance of
3936.11,muscle.
3936.943,Then you would want to ingest
some,protein sometime before
3939.21,10:00 AM.
3940.043,But obviously if you're
interested,in getting the health
3942.79,"effects of intermittent fasting,"
3944.43,that you wouldn't ingest any
food,for at least the first 60
3948.22,minutes upon waking.
3949.36,Now it's not as if at 10:01
AM,a gate slam shut and you
3954.22,"can't generate hypertrophy,"
of,course that's not the case.
3957.381,"However,"
3958.34,it's very interesting that
it,doesn't matter when the
3960.62,"resistance training,"
3961.68,the load bearing exercise
occurs,in the 24 hour cycle.
3965.342,"So whether or not in other words,"
3967.7,people are training early in
the,day or they're training
3969.9,late in the day.
3971.299,It still appears that ingesting
protein,early in the day
3974.29,"favors hypertrophy or that one is better,"
3978.157,or I should say more easily
able,to access hypertrophy by
3982.19,"way of these clock,"
3984.17,regulated protein synthesis
mechanisms,by ingesting protein
3986.686,"early in the day, in no way, shape or form"
3990.27,does this study say that
ingesting,protein later in the day
3993.24,is somehow bad for you?
3994.4,It just emphasizes the positive
effects,of ingesting protein
3997.223,early in the day for sake
of,muscle maintenance and or
4001.79,hypertrophy.
4002.98,So if you're somebody who is
mainly,concerned with muscle
4005.15,"maintenance and hypertrophy,"
4006.407,then it may make sense to move
that,feeding window earlier
4010.385,in the day.
4011.485,And certainly there are people
out,there who are interested
4014.53,"in muscle maintenance and hypertrophy,"
4015.602,who aren't doing
intermittent,"fasting at all,"
4017.747,"and that's also perfectly fine,"
4019.27,but this just so happens to be
an,episode about intermittent
4021.276,fasting and time restricted feeding.
4023.857,"There are of course,"
4025.53,modes of eating where one eats
small,meals spread throughout
4028.037,the day or weights meals differently.
4030.91,Such that meals early in the
day,are larger than later in
4033.47,the day or vice versa.
4034.303,There are a near infinite
number,of ways to organize this.
4037.208,But if you are somebody who
is,"interested in deriving,"
4040.525,the many clearly established
health,effects of
4043.507,"time-restricted feeding,"
4045.2,and you are somebody who would
like,to maintain or build
4047.903,"muscle,"
4050.184,then ingesting proteins in the
early,part of the day would
4054.669,be important to you at least
on,the basis of these results.
4058.88,And therefore that eight
hour,window that we've
4062.18,established as more or less
ideal,shifted to the later part
4066.07,of the day might not be
as,beneficial for you.
4068.101,Now I can just personally say that for me.
4070.945,"When I wake up in the morning,"
4072.8,it's very easy for me to
not,eat until noon or one or
4076.307,2:00 PM.
4077.59,Eating early in the day is
actually,somewhat of a challenge.
4080.158,"I discuss this point with Satchin,"
4082.445,because we were talking about
how,is it that one can move
4086.43,their feeding window or place
themselves,onto a different
4089.4,schedule of intermittent fasting.
4090.749,And it's very clear that one
needs,to provide a transition
4094.303,"period in order for that to happen,"
4096.74,you should allow yourself a
transition,period of anywhere
4099.26,from one week to 10 days in
which,you shift your feeding
4103.37,window by about an hour each day or so.
4106.107,And then once you establish
a,feeding window that feels
4109.81,comfortable for you and that
you,think you can maintain over
4112.37,"time,"
4113.21,that you simply maintain that
feeding,schedule for at least
4116.349,"30 days, but ideally you"
would,do that indefinitely.
4119.879,Now this turns out to be
important,based on data that
4122.306,they've gleaned from
this,My Circadian Clock
4126.33,massive experiment that
they've,"been doing,"
4127.81,where people are entering the
times,that they're feeding
4129.72,"and, and eating."
4131.292,"Excuse me, anytime we talk about mice,"
4132.983,I always think about feeding
4134.14,because I come from a background
4135.82,"in my lab, works on both"
laboratory,mice and on humans.
4138.072,And anytime I think about
"humans,","I think about eating,"
4140.28,but of course they are the same thing.
4142.977,The interesting thing to emerge
from,that very large data
4146.25,set in humans is that when
people,"log their feeding times,"
4150.394,"as I mentioned before,"
4151.73,oftentimes they think they're
eating,in an eight hour
4154.3,"window,"
4155.133,but they are actually eating
in,a much broader window.
4157.804,"However,"
4158.826,even for people that are very
good,about restricting their
4161.559,"feeding to a four, six"
or,"eight hour window,"
4165.15,if they're very strict about
the,"start and stop times,"
4167.047,"and when they ingest calories,"
4169.062,one of the findings that's
really,been important to note is
4172.247,that almost every individual
has,a lot of drift in when that
4177.883,eating window resides
in,their 24 hour period.
4181.22,"In particular on the weekends,"
4182.674,people are either extending or
shifting,their feeding window
4187.426,in a way that makes it seem
that,they've traveled to another
4191.06,time zone and are eating
according,to another time zone.
4194.017,And this is extremely important.
4196.8,"As I mentioned earlier,"
4198.617,based on the 2012 study
from,"Satchin's lab,"
4202.385,where eating at a particular
phase,of each 24 hour cycle can
4206.788,help enhance the expression
of,these clock genes.
4211.048,If you are eating within a
very,strict or semi strict
4216.44,"feeding window,"
4217.273,but that feeding window is
migrating,around from day to day
4219.763,or five days a week.
4221.28,You're really organized
about,"when that falls,"
4223.98,let's say for sake of
"example,","from noon to 8:00 PM,"
4227.19,"noon to 8:00 PM, Monday"
Noonday,"PM, Tuesday, Wednesday,"
4230.13,"noon to 8:00 PM, Thursday and so forth."
4232.52,"But then on the Saturday,"
4234.05,it's becoming 11:00 AM and
you're,"ending it early,"
4238.94,or perhaps your starting
early,"in the day on Sunday,"
4242.634,you're having brunch that
starts,"at nine 30 or 10,"
4245.71,and then it's extending
out,still just eight hours.
4248.27,But it shifting around that
can,cause disruptions in the
4251.745,circadian clock mechanisms
that,cause disruptions in the
4255.234,downstream effects of eating
that,are taking at least two to
4261.44,three days to recover from.
4262.989,So obviously we don't want to
be,overly neurotic about this
4266.54,"stuff, but because this is an"
episode,about the science of
4268.511,intermittent fasting and
time,"restricted feeding, as"
4270.87,important as how long
your,"feeding window is,"
4275.855,is where that feeding window
resides,in each 24 hour cycle.
4280.574,And perhaps even more important
than,that is that it be
4283.9,fairly regular where that
feeding,window resides.
4287.1,Because even if you have a
very,"short feeding window,"
4289.1,"if it's drifting around from day to day,"
4291.21,that actually offsets a
number,of the positive health
4294.305,effects of intermittent fasting.
4296.361,So to really just underscore
the,way that these different
4298.842,pieces of the biological
puzzle,"fit together,"
4301.943,if you are very strict or semi
strict,about your eight hour
4306.04,"feeding window,"
4306.873,but on the weekends that
eight,hour feeding window is
4308.77,falling later than it normally
would,during the middle of
4311.88,the week.
4312.755,"It is as if you are going to bed later,"
4315.82,even if you're going to
bed,"at the same time,"
4317.231,at least from the perspective
of,"metabolic health,"
4320.11,because of the way that eating
impacts,these clock genes and
4323.05,"impacts, or I should say subtracts,"
4325.567,the sleep-related fasting that
you,would normally experience
4330.135,if you were to finish eating
that,a couple hours before
4333.65,"bedtime, so again,"
4334.847,we don't want to create any
overly,obsessive or neurotic
4338.075,"focus on this, I think that most,"
4340.75,all people could benefit from
a,time-restricted feeding
4343.86,"schedule,"
4344.693,but they should really think
hard,about what they can stick
4346.5,to on a regular basis and
understand,that they tend to
4349.143,"underestimate the feeding window,"
4351.68,"that they actually are partaking in,"
4353.829,and that they should place that
feeding,window in a portion
4358.35,of the 24 hour cycle that
they,can be consistent on most
4360.936,"days, and I want to emphasize most again,"
4364.185,because we are not laboratory mice.
4366.62,We don't have a graduate student
coming,in for eight hours a
4368.84,day because that's what their
significant,other will allow
4370.76,them to do.
4371.593,And then removing the food
from,our jowls and from our
4373.34,"cages, we have access to food"
pretty,"much, 24 hours a day,"
4377.558,"along those lines, however,"
4379.461,there are things that we can
all,do that will allow us to
4383.562,"offset some of the drift if you will,"
4387.789,that we experience or that we
induce,in terms of when our
4390.446,feeding window occurs or that
the,feeding window might push
4394.396,out a little later and then
therefore,"start a little later,"
4397.57,"the next day, there are things"
that,"we can do in there,"
4400.514,things that we can take.
4401.725,And so I'd like to discuss those briefly.
4402.63,"So throughout this episode,"
4404.38,I've more or less been alluding
to,the fact that when you
4407.631,"eat, there's some period of"
time,afterwards in which you're
4410.854,"actually still eating,"
4412.78,at least from the
perspective,"of metabolism,"
4414.406,"because glucose is up,"
4415.85,insulin is up and you're
undergoing,different metabolic and
4420.17,digestive processes that don't
really,speak to you being in
4424.26,"a fasted state, right?"
4425.559,It's not just about when you
take,your last bite or your
4428.79,last sip.
4429.919,"However,"
4431.034,there are things that we can
do,to accelerate the transition
4434.075,from a fed state to a fasted state.
4440.4,And so I'd like to discuss what those are.
4442.22,And I want to emphasize that
the,term fed state is probably
4445.862,a better way to think about
it,than eating or not eating
4449.352,because we think of eating
the,"verb, we're eating,"
4452.21,"we're eating, okay, we're"
done,"eating I'm fasting now,"
4453.783,but you're not actually fasting
you,because you are fed.
4457.692,So we should really think about
fed,and unfed states because
4461.5,from a seller processes
perspective,and from a health
4464.27,"perspective,"
4465.103,that's actually what your body
and,your system are paying
4467.185,attention to.
4468.8,And by now with everything
that,"we've laid out,"
4471.34,I think that should be
intuitive,to understand.
4473.861,So there's a fun and exciting
concept,"related to this,"
4476.91,which is glucose clearing.
4478.649,You may have heard the old adage
that,if you take a 20 or 30
4483.04,"minute walk after dinner,"
4484.337,that it accelerates the rate
at,which you digest that food.
4487.81,"And indeed it does, clearing"
out,of glucose from your system
4491.73,can be accomplished through
a,"number of different means,"
4494.86,but light movement or
exercise,does increase gastric
4499.1,"emptying time, so for instance,"
4500.841,if you were to eat a meal
that,"ended at 8:00 PM,"
4505.74,"and then plop to the couch, watch TV,"
4509.06,"or get on your computer or go to sleep,"
4512.066,it would be five or six hours
until,you have transitioned
4516.104,from a fed state to a fasted state.
4519.038,"However,"
4519.871,you can accelerate that
considerably,by taking a 20 or 30
4524.05,"minute just light walk, it"
doesn't,have to be speed walking.
4527.3,"It certainly doesn't have to be jogging,"
4528.49,but just walking outside or moving around.
4530.878,So glucose clearing is an
important,aspect of the transition
4536.127,from the fed state to the fasted state.
4538.377,And just a light walk can
allow,"you to do that, now,"
4541.5,"if you can't get outside,"
4542.67,some people will go
through,"the gymnastics,"
4546.23,literally of doing things like
air,squats and pushups and
4548.94,"things like that, and indeed,"
4550.43,those will increase the expression
of,things like glut four
4552.999,and things that mobilize glucose
into,muscles and things of
4556.86,"that sort, but, you know,"
under,"most conditions,"
4559.44,most people aren't doing
push-ups,"after dinner,"
4561.26,"or certainly who've had a big meal,"
4563.15,just taking a light
walk,can be beneficial.
4565.356,"In addition, you could consider"
doing,intense exercise.
4570.581,Now you wouldn't necessarily
want,to do that immediately
4573.208,after eating.
4574.19,So let's take a look at what
high-intensity,training of any
4576.926,"kind does to blood glucose,"
because,"in this case,"
4580.56,it turns out that when you
do,high intensity training
4583.04,actually has opposite
effects,"on blood glucose,"
4586.128,depending on whether or not
you,do it early or later in the
4588.94,day.
4589.89,So a fairly recent study looked
at,"so-called hit training,"
4593.07,"high intensity interval training,"
4594.408,which of course can take
many,different forms.
4597.05,It can take the form of
circuit,training with weights.
4599.62,"It can take the form of, you know,"
4600.815,burpees and pushups and sprints
and,all sorts of different
4604.0,things.
4605.015,But high intensity interval
training,is typically training
4607.04,that gets people's heart
rates,"up, you know,"
4608.822,well above 70% of maximum and
then,brief periods of rest and
4613.557,then repeating and how long
the,high intensity interval
4616.44,training of course will also vary.
4617.567,"There's there are a very brief, you know,"
4620.67,six or 12 or 15 minute workouts.
4623.01,Some people can carry on
with,high intensity interval
4625.58,training for up to 45
or,maybe even 60 minutes
4628.46,in extreme cases.
4629.41,But when you look at the
studies,that have explored high
4633.47,intensity interval training and
its,"effect on blood glucose,"
4636.216,there are a couple of studies
that,"leap out, for instance,"
4639.07,one that emphasized that blood
glucose,levels will actually
4641.485,increase if high intensity
interval,training is performed
4644.291,early in the day and will
decrease,if high intensity
4647.294,interval training is
performed,later in the day.
4650.623,Now the purpose for this
exploration,was not to explore
4656.8,clearance of blood glucose for
sake,of intermittent fasting.
4659.83,It was mainly focused on athletic
performance,and whether or
4662.42,not that was better early in
the,"day or later in the day,"
4664.4,et cetera.
4665.61,But we can extract some
information,from these studies that
4669.771,are beneficial for sake of
understanding,glucose clearing.
4673.227,If you have ingested food
throughout,the afternoon and
4678.13,"evening and late in the day,"
4679.16,and you're thinking about going
to,sleep and you'd like to
4681.84,enter sleep in a way that
is,"less fed and more fasted,"
4685.144,then engaging in high-intensity
interval,training in the
4688.73,afternoon will lower or
evening,"I should say,"
4691.82,will lower blood glucose.
4693.726,And in that way will help you
accelerate,your transition
4696.67,into the fastest state provided
you,don't ingest something
4699.31,after the high intensity
interval,training.
4701.58,Now is the increase in blood
glucose,that occurs from high
4704.942,intensity interval
training,"early in the day,"
4707.63,"is that detrimental, not necessarily."
4709.59,So that oftentimes is
associated,with the shuttling of
4712.135,nutrients to the muscles.
4714.21,They've just done a lot of hard work.
4716.0,So it's not that high intensity
interval,training should not
4718.599,"be done early in the day,"
in,"fact, for many people,"
4721.36,including myself training
early,"in the day,"
4723.448,just for the way that my
psychology,and biology works is
4726.26,always better for me than
training,later in the day.
4729.08,And the other important
thing,to mention is that high
4731.366,intensity interval training
done,late in the day can be
4734.246,beneficial from the perspective
of,"glucose clearing,"
4737.811,"lowering blood glucose,"
4739.7,and helping transition from
the,fed to the fasted state in
4742.683,preparation for sleep.
4744.31,"However,"
4745.4,if you're ingesting caffeine
or,anything to engage in that
4748.464,high intensity interval training
in,a way that prevents you
4751.5,"from getting to sleep well,"
4752.512,then it's going to be detrimental overall.
4754.496,So the reason I mentioned
this,"is of course,"
4757.567,because it's nice to know that
light,walks after dinner or
4761.05,any other meal for that matter
or,high intensity interval
4763.347,training provided it's done
in,the second half of the day
4765.83,can lower blood glucose and
speed,the transition from fed to
4768.847,fasted states.
4770.942,But I also mentioned it because
what,we are really trying to
4774.253,achieve when we partake in
intermittent,fasting so-called
4778.021,time-restricted feeding is what
we're,really trying to do is
4781.544,access unfed states or fasted states.
4785.471,It's not really about when
you,eat and what you do.
4788.52,It's about extending the
duration,of the fasting period
4791.787,"as long as you can,"
4793.402,in a way that's still compatible
with,"your eating, right,"
4796.615,not the other way around.
4798.436,And this gets back to this
key,"feature of our biology,"
4802.1,which is that what we eat
when,"we eat, when we exercise,"
4806.0,"when we view light,"
4806.92,it's about setting a context
or,a set of conditions in your
4809.137,brain and body.
4810.807,So it's not so much about the
activities,that you undergo.
4813.614,It's about the activities you
undergo,and their relationship
4817.64,to one another over
"time,","and so in this way,"
4821.46,it really beautifully highlights
the,way that your biology
4824.25,is interacting all the
time,light is setting.
4826.41,"When you're going to be awakened,"
4828.433,"when you're going to be asleep,"
4829.639,when you eat is going to be
determining,when you're going to
4831.443,"be awakened, when you're"
going,to be asleep.
4833.04,And when you eat is also going
to,be determining when you
4835.253,are able to clear out debris
from,your brain and body and
4839.261,repair the various cells
and,"mechanisms of your body,"
4842.76,when you're able to reduce
those,inflammatory cytokines
4845.334,throughout your body.
4846.97,And this is really the beauty
of,"time research and feeding,"
4849.72,"which is, it's not really"
about,restricting your feeding.
4852.041,It's about accessing the beauty
of,"the fasted state, now,"
4856.19,there are other ways to clear
out,blood glucose that involve
4860.108,supplements or prescription drugs.
4862.35,These are so-called glucose
disposal,"agents, glucose,"
4866.88,"disposal agents, such as Metformin,"
4869.45,"which is a prescription drug or berberine,"
4872.51,which is an over the counter
substance,will lead to very
4875.585,dramatic reductions in blood glucose.
4878.45,And so they shift you from
a,fed to a fasted state.
4880.613,And I know many people who
take,berberine before eating
4885.125,meals that include a large
number,"of carbohydrates,"
4888.96,"for instance, as a way"
to,clear out glucose.
4891.731,Now I've tried berberine before.
4893.349,And what I can tell you is
that,"if you take berberine,"
4896.212,which by the way is very
much,"like Metformin,"
4898.53,its effects are almost
identical,"to Metformin in fact,"
4900.601,but it's much less expensive
and,it's over the counter.
4903.85,If you take berberine
and,you have not ingested
4905.663,"carbohydrates, many"
"people,","including myself,"
4909.115,"experience a splitting headache,"
4912.19,you become hypoglycemic because
it,is a glucose clearing
4915.184,agent.
4916.27,So if you're going to experiment
with,things like Metformin
4918.93,"and or berberine or similar,"
4921.14,you want to be very cautious
that,you're not clearing out
4923.967,"blood glucose, that's already low."
4925.787,And the dose response for this
varies,tremendously from one
4929.836,individual to the next.
4931.63,And there's a strong circadian component.
4934.06,So if some people react very
well,to berberine early in the
4936.572,"day, but find that later in the day,"
4939.1,it provides extreme headaches
for,some people it's the
4942.073,opposite.
4943.71,So I caution you in exploring
things,like berberine and
4946.739,Metformin that you should
expect,to experience a number of
4950.27,physical and psychological
effects,that may work for you
4953.534,"might be great for you,"
4955.07,but might also not be
great,"for you, nowadays,"
4957.373,there are a number of
commercially,"available,"
4959.241,"continuous glucose monitors, I've tried"
4962.11,"one of these, it involves putting"
what's,essentially a patch
4965.76,with a little needle
that,"goes into your skin,"
4967.07,which is continuing
"continually,","excuse me,"
4969.31,monitoring your blood glucose.
4970.567,And you can look at it
at,"an app on your phone,"
4972.68,and you can learn a lot that
way,about how different foods
4975.07,impact the increases in
decrease,in blood glucose.
4978.145,If you're doing experiments
with,"berberine or Metformin,"
4980.657,you can see how those
impact,your blood glucose.
4983.566,You can see how exercise
hit,training or otherwise
4986.645,"impacts blood glucose, excuse me again,"
4989.759,it's very hard to assess blood
glucose,without a continuous
4993.9,"blood glucose monitor, and"
if,"you're not using one,"
4996.84,you're mainly going to be relying
on,"subjective things like,"
4999.6,"oh, I feel like I have low"
blood,"sugar, or I feel shaky."
5002.37,Like I have high blood sugar
or,shaky cause you have low
5005.11,blood sugar.
5006.498,So I have to say that glucose
clearing,agents that involve a
5009.976,walk or exercise moderate or
intense,are going to be a lot
5015.54,easier to titrate and adjust
the,levels of then things that
5019.36,"you're going to take, where"
you,have to adjust the dosage.
5021.56,"And then once you ingest a certain dosage,"
5023.219,"you're along for the ride,"
5024.85,at least until the effects of
that,particular compound wear
5026.918,"off, it doesn't mean those"
things,don't have utility.
5029.49,It doesn't mean people aren't
using,them because many people
5031.73,"are, but they are potentially"
a,very sharp blade
5037.17,that is a double sided blade.
5038.93,So I encourage you to
approach,those with caution.
5041.07,"If you decide to at all,"
5043.1,it's worth thinking about what
the,low blood glucose state
5046.56,is and why it's beneficial as
well,as why it might produce
5050.176,headaches.
5051.14,And in some cases can also
adjust,the effects of other
5053.76,"hormones in the fasted state,"
5054.908,a number of different proteins
that,are expressed in cells
5058.814,undergo changes in their expression.
5061.86,We talked about this
"earlier,","when we are fasted,"
5064.371,we tend to reduce the activity
of,a particular protein
5067.793,called MTOR mammalian target of rapamycin.
5071.09,MTOR is very active in cells
while,they are growing.
5075.46,"So throughout development,"
5076.594,it's also very active in
cancers,of various kinds.
5080.855,MTOR needs to be what's
called,phosphorylated.
5085.322,If you don't know what that
"means,",don't worry about it.
5086.155,But phosphorylation is a manner
in,which certain proteins
5089.66,are altered so that they can
actually,be functional within
5092.33,"cells,"
5093.55,MTOR is associated with cell
growth,of all kinds healthy
5095.88,and unhealthy.
5097.731,"When MTOR is phosphorylated,"
there's,a marker called PS6
5101.347,so phospho MTOR expressed as PM6.
5104.581,If this is all escaping
"you,",don't worry about it.
5107.68,Phospho MTOR and PS6
are,reduced by fasting.
5111.79,"Now, this makes sense."
5113.46,"If you think about it,"
5114.293,because eating and growth are
associated,"with each other,"
5116.845,"fasting is not necessarily anti-growth,"
5121.597,but it is not pro
"growth,","and when we fast,"
5124.362,we see increases in cells
of,"things like AMPK,"
5127.42,"the sirtuins, things like transcription"
5130.74,"factors like FOX-O,"
5132.21,ATF and ketones or ketone bodies.
5134.75,You may have heard of the ketogenic diet.
5136.32,What's the point of all
this,"biochemistry, it's not,"
5138.347,you just blitz you with a
bunch,of cellular biology and
5141.188,biochemistry.
5142.7,It's to say that we have cell
growth,pathways involving MTOR
5145.29,"and PSX,"
5147.61,and we have cell repair and
cell,shrinkage processes that
5152.391,"are associated with AMPK,"
the,"so-called sirtuins,"
5155.349,which Dr. Davidson Claire
5157.88,from Harvard and others are famous for
5159.42,discovering and understanding
things,"like AMPK,"
5164.14,these two different divergent
pathways,of cell growth and
5167.28,cell breakdown and repair
and,"by breakdown, I mean,"
5171.13,"actual clearance autophagy, and repair."
5174.506,Those can be triggered by
being,in either the fed or the
5177.93,fasted state.
5179.01,So one way I'd like you to
think,"about the fed state,"
5181.71,"not just eating,"
5182.543,but having recently eaten
or,"the fasted state,"
5184.937,"meaning high blood glucose and,"
5187.756,"or you've recently eat eaten,"
5190.239,or are currently eating
or,"drinking calories,"
5192.667,is that when you eat or when
you,"don't eat, when you're fed,"
5196.35,"when you're fasted,"
5197.183,you are either promoting
cellular,growth of all kinds or
5200.37,you're promoting cellular repair
and,clearance of all kinds.
5204.48,"And so, again,"
5205.313,this is about setting conditions
in,the brain and body.
5208.34,It's not so much about
when,"you eat food A or B,"
5212.095,"it leads to increases in MTOR,"
anytime,"you eat any food,"
5216.339,"doesn't matter if it's plant-based,"
5218.25,"animal-based fat, protein,"
"carbohydrate,",doesn't matter.
5221.89,You are biasing your system
towards,a biochemical state of
5224.567,cell growth.
5225.87,And any time you haven't eaten
for,a while or blood glucose
5229.27,"is low,"
5230.11,you're biasing your system
toward,a state of cellar repair.
5233.94,And this is why people who
do,not suffer from any blood
5237.853,glucose regulation issues
take,things like berberine as
5241.391,"glucose, disposal agents,"
or,take Metformin.
5243.96,I'm not necessarily
suggesting,"that you do that,"
5246.069,but it's because those
things,mimic fasting.
5249.21,They create situations in the
body,that promote things like
5251.951,"AMPKs, and sirtuins,"
5253.67,and others to push your
body,and your system
5256.21,"down a route of repair,"
5257.299,even though you might have
just,"eaten a meal an hour ago,"
5260.075,along the lines of the health
benefits,of intermittent
5263.46,"fasting, there are nice data"
showing,improvements in the gut
5266.962,"microbiome and in particular,"
5270.316,in the treatment of irritable
bowel,syndrome and other forms
5273.86,"of colitis in time, restricted feeding,"
5277.67,meaning time-restricted feeding
seems,to be able to assist
5280.501,"people with those conditions,"
5282.227,following the general parameters
that,I discussed before
5285.45,eight hours and so forth.
5287.04,"Why and how, well, by way"
of,"intermittent fasting,"
5291.72,impacting the expression of
these,"various clock genes,"
5293.775,and because the clock genes
impact,the mucosal lining the
5296.75,"mucus lining of the gut,"
5298.749,it appears that intermittent
fasting,can reduce the amount
5303.684,of so-called lactobacillus
that's,present in the gut.
5307.582,And lactose bacillus is when
in,high levels is correlated
5311.464,with a number of different
metabolic,disorders.
5314.33,"At the same time,"
5315.18,time-restricted feeding seems
to,enhance the proliferation
5318.089,"of some of the gut microbiota,"
5320.604,like acetobacter and some of
the,other ones that promote
5324.63,"healthy mucosal lining,"
5326.59,and that promote better
overall,intestinal function.
5330.53,So these are pathways that
have,"now been established,"
5333.42,and it appears that
intermittent,fasting isn't just
5335.416,"modulating these processes,"
5337.39,but is actually having a direct
effect,on the mucosal lining
5339.582,in a way that favors a
healthier,gut microbiome.
5342.381,So it should come as no
surprise,that many people who
5345.31,experience gut issues benefit
from,restricting their feeding
5348.13,window to eight hours or so
per,every 24 hour period.
5351.74,The other very exciting finding
about,intermittent fasting
5353.813,is one of the major health issues
5356.263,these days is the proliferation
of,so-called non-alcoholic
5361.67,"fatty liver disease,"
5362.823,30 years or so non-alcoholic
fatty,liver disease was
5366.5,exceedingly rare to see in the
"clinic,","except in alcoholics,"
5369.372,fatty deposits in the liver are bad.
5372.64,It is essentially liver disease.
5374.542,Nowadays children and
adults,are showing up with
5377.641,non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
5380.2,Some of these people are
"obese,","others are not,"
5382.291,but it's a serious health concern.
5384.75,And it's growing in numbers all the time.
5387.316,A recent study that was
published,in Cell Reports
5391.02,Medicine just a couple of weeks
"ago,","tested the hypothesis,"
5394.89,whether or not the gut
microbiome,or so-called brown fat
5398.365,tissue is impacting the liver health.
5401.81,And in particular nonalcoholic
fatty,liver disease.
5405.519,The short takeaway from this
study,is that contrary to what
5408.84,"was previously thought,"
the,"gut microbiome,"
5411.111,while very important for a
number,of other processes in the
5414.65,body doesn't seem to be related
to,this non-alcoholic fatty
5418.23,liver disease.
5419.063,This is surprising to people
or,should be to those of you
5421.48,that have been following the
gut,"microbiome literature,"
5423.7,"however, brown fat,"
5425.469,which is a healthy fat that we
have,between our two scapulae
5429.687,"and in our upper neck,"
5430.78,it doesn't tend to be
blubbery,"type fat pads,"
5432.89,"but it sits deep to the skin,"
5434.61,but creates a thermogenic effect
in,the body that is helpful
5438.71,"for reducing the amount of other fat,"
5441.51,the type of fat that we're
more,typically used to thinking
5443.95,about and talking about
white,fat and pink fat that's
5446.16,subcutaneous fat around
the,abdomen and so forth.
5448.843,Brown fat seems to have a
direct,correlation with the lack
5453.89,of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
5455.61,What this study showed was
that,in people that have
5458.496,"diminished concentrations of brown fat,"
5461.951,there is a higher probability
of,having non-alcoholic fatty
5466.847,liver disease.
5467.85,Now the good news is brown
fat,stores can be increased.
5470.71,"And again, this isn't going to"
create,blubber of brown fat.
5473.29,This is going to create increased
thermogenesis,and actually
5475.51,make people leaner and brown
fat,has a number of other
5478.186,important positive effects.
5479.464,"Now,"
5480.72,this is interesting because
cold,exposure of anywhere from
5483.236,"one to three minutes, two"
or,"four times per week,"
5486.77,"or maybe even 10 minutes,"
5487.71,two to four times per week
can,increase brown fat stores.
5490.192,Also time-restricted feeding
has,now been tied to the
5494.599,density of brown fat store.
5497.61,So time-restricted feeding also
seems,to positively increase
5500.09,"brown fat stores,"
5502.14,probably because of the way
that,brown fat stores relate to
5504.286,"epinephrin and adrenaline,"
5505.85,which tend to go up when we're fasted.
5507.752,What does this all mean?
5509.18,This means for sake of
liver,health and for sake of
5511.422,"reducing, or maybe preventing,"
or,"even potentially,"
5515.434,I want to underline potentially
reversing,non-alcoholic
5518.5,"fatty liver disease,"
5519.333,time-restricted feeding also
appears,to be beneficial.
5523.059,Many people out there are
interested,in optimizing their
5526.48,"hormones, and as we mentioned earlier,"
5528.84,insulin is a hormone and
time-restricted,feeding seems to
5531.064,have very positive effects on
overall,insulin profiles and
5534.395,"so forth, but anytime"
you,"mentioned hormones,"
5538.005,people immediately seem to leap
to,"the sex steroid hormones,"
5541.43,"testosterone, and estrogen,"
5542.74,"because indeed they have powerful effects,"
5544.93,both in the short-term and
the,long-term in terms of our
5548.28,mental and physical
health,and performance.
5550.781,There's at least one study
that's,explored the effects of
5553.79,"time, restricted eating on performance,"
5555.8,"athletic performance, immune"
"function,",and body composition.
5559.853,"This was a study by Mauro, et al,"
5563.09,that was performed on elite cyclists.
5565.11,So I want to point that out.
5566.69,"I was a randomized control trial,"
5568.565,but what's really nice about
this,study is that it explored
5573.76,a number of different hormonal
parameters,in people that
5578.23,"were using time restricted eating,"
5579.69,or that had a more extended eating window.
5581.471,And they tracked
everything,very carefully.
5583.891,And the amount of food they
were,eating was actually pretty
5587.235,"considerable, 4,800 calories,"
so,"that's a lot of calories,"
5591.87,"but then again,"
5592.703,they were very active and
they've,measured a number of
5596.04,different things related
to,"VO2 max, et cetera,"
5599.559,performance and overall performance
at,what they did cycling
5603.794,is not the point that I
want,to emphasize here.
5606.91,Although there were some
positive,effects on their
5609.22,performance related to
time-restricted,"eating, the point"
5613.42,I want to talk about relates
to,things that presumably
5616.253,"relate to most, everybody,"
5618.37,which are the effects on
things,"like glucose, thyroid,"
5622.41,"hormone, testosterone, sex,"
"hormone,","binding globulin,"
5625.91,which can bind up testosterone
and,prevent the so-called
5628.725,"free form of testosterone,"
5631.0,which is the one that has most
of,the actions in the brain
5633.567,and body.
5634.631,And the major takeaway
from,this study was that
5637.849,time-restricted feeding of
the,same amount of calories as
5641.72,the so-called control
"condition,","okay, same calories,"
5645.53,but either compact throughout
the,24 hour cycle to an eight
5648.304,hour feeding window or allowing
them,to eat over a larger
5652.243,feeding window did lead to
significant,decreases in free
5655.935,testosterone.
5657.499,And I think a number of people
will,raise their eyebrows to
5660.67,"that and think, oh,"
5661.77,well then maybe time-restricted
feeding,is not for me.
5664.14,There are a number of important
"considerations,","of course,"
5666.16,one is while they decrease
in,free testosterone was
5669.846,significant.
5671.122,It's also going to depend
on,where people start out.
5674.0,So if somebody has already
lower,modest levels of
5676.18,"testosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,"
5679.92,that could lead them into a
state,of poor performance and
5683.23,"wellbeing, whereas if somebody"
has,"higher testosterone,"
5685.409,a decrease will necessarily do that.
5687.93,So it's important to take
that,into consideration.
5690.12,This is why I'm always such
a,fan of people doing their
5693.08,blood work and knowing what's
going,on under the hood for
5695.44,"them, a very change in"
hormonal,profile was cortisol.
5699.769,"So-called stress, hormone cortisol,"
5702.7,of course is also naturally
released,early in the day in a
5705.37,healthy way to wake you
up,"and promote alertness,"
5707.62,but you don't want its levels
to,be too high or to have
5710.839,"peaks in cortisol late in the day,"
5713.63,that's actually correlated
with,depression and a number of
5715.65,other untoured things.
5719.181,I would have thought that by
restricting,a feeding window to
5721.931,"a particular time each day,"
5723.691,that these hard training
cyclists,would have undergone
5727.0,"increases in serum cortisol and in fact,"
5730.06,the opposite was true.
5731.408,They had significant reductions
in,serum cortisol as a
5735.061,"consequence of time, restricted feeding."
5737.313,I should mention there were
significant,reductions in serum
5739.757,"cortisol also in the control group,"
5742.72,but not to the same extent.
5744.061,And the two groups did
differ,significantly from one
5747.03,another.
5748.09,Now this is important because
if,you just look at one
5750.733,"hormone testosterone, you'd"
"say,","okay, based on these data,"
5753.903,time-restricted feeding is
reducing,testosterone levels
5757.179,"significantly,"
5758.185,even though the number of
calories,is quite high and is held
5761.0,"constant across the study, but in fact,"
5763.28,"because cortisol is lower,"
5765.388,it may mean that the effects
of,testosterone or the
5768.37,reduction in testosterone is offset.
5770.3,And that's because cortisol
and,testosterone are always in
5773.09,this somewhat of a dance
in,"terms of cortisol,"
5776.089,inhibiting the effects of
testosterone,largely and vice
5778.465,versa.
5780.19,So it is interesting and
important,to look at the total
5782.853,gallery of hormones.
5784.45,And they did look at a number of hormones.
5785.88,They looked at other inflammatory markers.
5788.071,Those were not increased.
5789.409,That's not surprising if you
remember,back to the 2012
5791.708,Satchin Panda study this
early,pioneering study on time
5795.379,restricted feeding.
5797.02,They saw reductions in stress
hormones,and in inflammatory
5799.959,"markers in time, restricted feeding mice."
5802.655,"And here, this also seems"
to,be the case in humans.
5805.373,So the takeaway is for sake
of,"hormone health, time"
5810.214,restricted feeding is
compatible,with quality hormone
5815.33,"health, even in high-performing athletes,"
5817.256,"based on everything we know,"
and,"that we've discussed,"
5819.93,I would not suggest that
people,restrict their feeding
5822.24,"window to less than eight hours,"
5823.77,especially if they're training
hard,on a regular basis.
5825.803,And it's not just athletes
5828.7,"that should pay attention to this,"
5829.993,"when we are working very hard,"
when,we are psychologically
5833.48,"stressed, when we are studying for exams,"
5837.01,or we are in conflict with
somebody,"on a regular basis,"
5840.207,that creates a stress in the body
5842.92,that's very similar to
that,"of physical training,"
5845.47,the body and brain don't
distinguish,between physical stress
5847.89,"and mental stress, it's"
all,nervous system.
5849.75,Remember that it's just
cortisol,and adrenaline.
5852.06,There's no special hormone
just,for physical stress versus
5855.292,"psychological stress, so again,"
5858.001,in thinking about what sort of
feeding,window will be right
5860.45,"for you,"
5861.283,we arrive back at this eight
hour,time been that seems more
5864.215,"or less flexible for most conditions,"
5867.045,even high-performing elite athletes.
5869.73,"And I would say just by logical extension,"
5872.263,even for people that have a
lot,of stress in their life.
5875.12,And I personally wouldn't suggest
that,people who have a lot
5878.231,of stress in their life where
the,potential for stress in
5880.53,their life shorten their
feeding,window much shorter than
5884.89,"eight hours,"
5885.723,because then you would expect
that,you would start to
5888.24,increase some of the inflammatory markers.
5890.43,"You would increase the stress hormones,"
5891.797,and you would be decreasing
things,like testosterone and
5895.98,"estrogen, some of the"
sex,steroid hormones.
5897.75,"So again, it's all about context"
and,"the eight hour window,"
5899.791,"it isn't holy,"
5901.33,but seems to be a really useful
guide,to extract the great
5904.637,health benefits of
which,"there are many in,"
5908.45,of which we've discussed from
intermittent,"fasting time,"
5911.419,restricted feeding.
5913.218,And yet that it could still be
compatible,with decent social
5916.329,schedules and for maintaining
hormone,health in keeping with
5919.373,"this,"
5920.375,for women that are trying to
maintain,ovulatory cycles or
5923.884,for couples that are
trying,to get pregnant.
5925.906,I think it's also important
to,not create a feeding window
5929.898,that's too short.
5931.576,The relationship between
feeding,and body fat stores and
5936.191,glucose and leptin and hormones
is,a well-established one.
5940.71,"And we can summarize it very easily here,"
5942.33,although I've done several
episodes,related to this
5944.24,previously on optimizing hormone health.
5946.59,But basically we undergo
puberty,when there's enough food
5951.084,and there's enough body fat
that,the body fat sends a signal
5954.97,to the brain called leptin.
5956.35,That's a hormone that comes
from,body fat signals to the
5958.47,"brain to turn on puberty that's puberty,"
5960.535,but even as adults for
women,"that are menstruating,"
5964.689,there needs to be sufficient
leptin,signaling to the brain
5967.99,in order to maintain ovulation
because,of the way that the
5970.09,brain communicates with the
pituitary,and the ovaries.
5972.84,Similarly for men fasting
or,extreme exercise plus
5979.086,"fasting,"
5980.07,we now know reduces testosterone
it's,impacts are not
5983.977,"exactly clear, however,"
if,"you reduce food intake,"
5987.725,either in total calories
or,"in duration too much,"
5992.12,you will suffer a drop in sperm
"counts,",fertility will drop.
5995.76,And this makes sense.
5996.593,"The body is communicating to the brain,"
5998.18,whether or not conditions
are,sufficient in the body to
6001.163,"reproduce and to presumably,"
6004.39,and hopefully support the
health,and wellbeing of those
6007.39,offspring.
6008.223,So there's a logical link
between,body fat and eating and
6010.35,how much food is available
to,you and how long it's
6013.784,available to you and the signals
in,the brain that allow for
6016.711,reproductive success.
6018.49,There are some data that pointed
differences,in the effects
6021.086,of intermittent fasting
for,males versus females.
6025.03,"Those data right now only come from mice,"
6027.441,that study was published
by,"Satchin Panda recently,"
6030.47,we still await the studies in humans.
6032.757,Some people do not do well on
intermittent,fasting either in
6036.79,terms of mood or hormone health.
6038.87,And so everyone needs to determine
for,themselves whether or
6040.96,not having a time restricted
feeding,window is good for
6044.05,them.
6044.883,How long that time-restricted
feeding,window should be.
6047.11,I think eight hours is kind
of,a nice minimum to adhere to
6050.31,based on everything that
we've,covered today.
6052.27,And for some people time-restricted
feeding,is not going to
6055.851,be compatible with
hormone,"health, for them,"
6058.18,for them eating more meals
spread,"throughout the day,"
6061.014,"presumably smaller meals,"
6062.615,same caloric intake is going
to,be more beneficial for their
6066.3,hormones.
6067.133,This is something that is
going,to be individual and is
6068.86,going to have to be determined
on,an individual basis.
6071.97,"However, if you're going to"
try,"time restricted feeding,"
6074.338,I do want to remind you that
taking,a period of three to
6077.05,seven or ideally 10 days
to,"transition into it,"
6080.09,"not just going,"
6081.08,flipping from eating to three
meals,a day that span from
6083.515,6:00 AM to 10:00 PM and
suddenly,going to an eight hour
6086.42,"feeding window,"
6087.253,but rather winnowing down that
feeding,window about an hour
6090.457,or so per day is going to allow
the,hormone systems of your
6093.683,"body, including leptin the"
hypocretin,"orexin system,"
6097.46,which are systems within the
"body,","that signal to the brain,"
6099.57,that food is about to come
allowing,those systems to adjust
6103.27,so that you're not
overwhelmingly,"hungry, irritable,"
6105.766,and you're not throwing your
whole,hormone system out of
6108.259,whack.
6109.295,I keep coming back to this
eight,"hour feeding window,"
6111.91,and I want to provide a
little,more basis for it.
6114.24,And just to encourage that
it's,not completely arbitrary.
6118.243,The lengthy review that
I,"mentioned earlier,"
6120.835,features a number of studies
that,have used this eight hour
6123.46,"feeding window,"
6124.422,but there's a particular study
that,I'd like to highlight
6128.28,mainly because I don't expect
people,to delve into the full
6130.072,reference list of the other review.
6132.056,And this is a study that was carried out
6134.331,between Satchi Panda's lab
6135.991,and Krista Varady's labs.
6138.44,This is a collaboration.
6139.76,The study was carried out in
humans,and is entitled effects
6142.75,of eight hour time restricted
feeding,on body weight and
6145.59,"metabolic disease, risk factors"
in,"obese adults, excuse me."
6149.653,"And this study essentially showed,"
6152.7,I'll just read the conclusions
that,an eight hour time
6156.56,restricted feeding produces a
mild,caloric restriction and
6159.862,weight loss without calorie
"counting,","so that's key, right?"
6165.07,These people aren't calorie
counting,somehow just by
6167.14,adhering to an eight hour window.
6169.013,They are taking in fewer
calories,than they're burning off
6173.862,and clinically it reduced blood pressure.
6177.9,"So I mentioned the study,"
6178.88,not because there aren't many
others,involving the eight
6181.07,"hour feeding window also in humans,"
6182.435,but because the eight hour
feeding,window has been tested in
6185.636,obese adults and non obese adults.
6187.86,And there are even a
few,studies in children.
6189.901,So this eight hour window seems
to,be a really good rule of
6193.33,thumb and a kind of anchor
around,which we can each think
6196.562,about incorporating
time,restricted feeding.
6199.94,"There are of course,"
other,patterns of feeding.
6202.21,And while some people have
engaged,in longer fasts of 24
6206.961,"hours, 36 hours or more"
alternate,"day fasting,"
6213.16,"meaning eating one day,"
6215.24,not eating the next day or in
some,cases eating one day and
6218.02,"eating very few calories,"
500,or 600 calories
6220.69,the next day has been tested.
6223.45,A few studies have also
looked,at eating a sort of
6225.474,maintenance level of
calories,"for five days,"
6228.45,and then taking two days
and,"fast clear through,"
6231.561,"or eating very few calories,"
you,"know, 300 or 500 calories."
6235.91,"In fact,"
6236.743,there's a sort of a community
online,of people that are
6240.09,"exploring longer,"
6240.923,fast for sake of trying to
offset,dementia or reverse
6243.199,"effects of dementia, thus"
"far,","at least in my awareness,"
6248.314,there isn't any quality clinical
peer,reviewed study on that
6252.67,"yet for sake of dementia,"
although,"I await those studies,"
6255.827,"and if anyone's aware of them,"
6257.57,please send me a link in the comments.
6259.11,But alternate day fasting has
gotten,the so-called safe bill
6264.03,of health.
6264.863,This has been written up meaning
that,people didn't suffer
6266.541,"bone loss, they didn't suffer"
any,major detrimental effects.
6270.393,It does seem that it can create
significant,weight loss and
6275.382,can help with obese individuals
that,it can reduce resting
6279.228,"blood glucose,"
6280.228,and every other day fasting
in,many cases can produce more
6283.331,rapid effects on weight loss
and,reductions in blood glucose
6287.455,"than time restricted feeding, however,"
6289.85,every other day type fasting
for,most people is not going to
6294.344,be feasible.
6296.14,They're just not going to be
able,to do that for a long
6297.96,period of time.
6298.793,And what hasn't really been
done,is the follow-up to see
6300.482,whether or not people who do
every,other day fasting or five
6303.225,days of eating followed
by,"two days of fasting,"
6306.15,whether or not that leads
to,"a rebound in weight gain,"
6308.79,whether or not that leads to
a,"rebound in blood glucose,"
6310.94,et cetera.
6311.773,So for now the eight hour feeding
window,and time restricted
6314.8,"feeding seems to be the most tested,"
6318.715,supported in animal studies and
in,human studies and the one
6322.594,around which I think
most,people should orient
6325.67,if they're considering getting
into,"time-restricted feeding,"
6328.27,it's also sort of hard to
imagine,how one could include a
6331.534,significant exercise schedule
or,work schedule on every
6336.25,other day fasting.
6337.12,"Remember, in any study, people"
are,"often being compensated,"
6339.98,or at least are incentivized
in,some way to adhere to the
6343.346,study.
6344.348,This is one of the major issues
that,I have with any study
6346.91,that says that three or four
different,diets are essentially
6349.617,equal in terms of their
ability,to produce weight loss.
6353.35,Adherence is very different
in,the outside world where you
6357.025,don't have a researcher
monitoring,you where you're not
6359.4,logging all your food.
6360.583,Most people don't do that consistently.
6362.514,And we can take a little bit
of,a neuroscience perspective
6365.038,on this to try and arrive
at,what the best kind of
6367.727,"organization of an eating plan,"
6370.16,"or if we wanted to call it a diet,"
6371.64,we could would be for you.
6374.065,Many people find it easier
to,just not eat for certain
6377.163,periods of each 24 hour cycle
than,"to eat smaller portions,"
6381.65,portion control is very
hard,"for some people,"
6384.327,for other people it's
"manageable,",but people like me.
6388.57,I don't eat half the croissant.
6390.68,"I don't think it's a real thing, it's not,"
6393.109,"it's not available to me, I should say."
6395.34,"Now, of course I could"
eat,"just half a croissant,"
6397.596,but I noticed that when
I,"eat the croissant,"
6399.77,because they're so delicious
that,it creates a rise in blood
6402.81,glucose a rise in the other
hormones,and chemicals that are
6406.76,associated with ingesting
"delicious,",highly palatable food.
6409.763,And it's actually a lot of work
for,me to just eat half the
6412.611,croissant.
6414.008,There's something that's much
more,thoroughly satisfying
6418.585,about eating the entire croissant.
6420.69,And actually there's something
that,somewhat satisfying
6423.39,about not eating the croissant at all.
6425.14,And just knowing that later I
can,eat the whole croissant.
6427.43,Now that's me.
6428.4,Other people find that they
don't,have any trouble with
6431.38,portion control that for them
just,eating small bits of food
6434.85,throughout the day is what
sets,them in the right
6436.79,psychological and physical
state,"for sake of work,"
6439.44,et cetera.
6440.273,And I mentioned work and
mental,focus because one of the
6442.193,aspects of fasting that have
drawn,a lot of people to time
6445.598,restricted feeding and fasting
is,the clarity of mind that
6449.519,people get.
6450.945,"When first of all,"
6452.9,they don't have to think about
when,they're going to eat
6454.78,because they know when
their,eating window begins.
6457.008,They also don't have to
think,about regulating their
6459.036,behavior because they already
know,when they're going to eat
6462.743,and when they're not going to eat.
6464.24,"Whereas when you're restricting portions,"
6465.655,you actually have to make
decisions,all the while.
6468.147,"You know, and I think I like"
many,"people decide, well,"
6471.515,"you know, is that exactly half?"
6473.41,Or could I have like another
wrong,on the croissant?
6475.63,This kind of thing. I
don't,negotiate with food.
6477.73,That's why I like a time
restricted,feeding window.
6479.841,"I know I'm going to eat for, in my case,"
6481.95,"I use a 10 hour feeding window or so,"
6483.588,and I'll eat the whole croissant.
6485.82,"I just don't have to think about it, now,"
6488.176,the food choices that you make
inside,of that feeding window
6491.34,are of course also going
to,be very important.
6492.963,"Certain foods will increase blood glucose,"
6495.12,such that you're going to
get,hungrier and hungrier.
6496.91,Others will maintain lower
blood,glucose and will allow you
6500.37,to be more controlled in
the,foods that you pursue.
6503.427,Those are all individual
considerations,that are deserving
6506.094,of their own entire episode.
6507.696,But I do want to point out
that,the advantage of time
6510.449,restricted feeding is that
it,involves a lot of the
6514.26,decision-making in the brain.
6515.74,The so-called go no-go
circuitries,"of our basal ganglia,"
6519.38,if you want to know this
areas,that control them.
6521.41,"Anytime we have to restrict a behavior,"
6523.68,that's called a no-go.
6524.918,Anytime we engage in a
"behavior,","that's a go,"
6527.395,no go behaviors require a
lot,of what's called top-down
6530.8,"control, and it's very"
metabolically,demanding.
6533.91,And so time restricted feeding
allows,you to depart from the
6537.11,whole no-go go negotiation that
you,have to undergo when you
6540.129,have to restrict portions.
6543.61,And so I think this is a
reason,why many people have
6545.178,gravitated towards time
restricted,feeding and why for
6548.26,people that don't want to have
to,think about all that it's
6551.43,just very straight forward.
6553.01,One of the more hot button
issues,out there is whether or
6555.85,not given equal amounts of
caloric,intake and equal amounts
6561.232,of activity and equal amounts
of,"nutrients, et cetera,"
6565.48,whether or not restricting
food,to a particular window
6569.03,"biases,"
6570.01,more weight loss toward fat
loss,versus loss of other
6572.839,"tissues, because of course,"
when,"we lose weight,"
6574.562,we can lose that from any number
of,different storage sites
6578.34,"within the body, muscle"
"water,","glycogen, or fat."
6584.175,Now this is such a hot button
issue,that I almost don't want
6587.76,"to get into it, but I'm"
going,"to get into it anyway,"
6589.4,because there are data
that,are very interesting.
6592.287,This is covered in the review
that,"I mentioned earlier,"
6595.812,that describes how if people
follow,a time-restricted
6600.259,feeding schedule for long periods of time.
6603.81,"So 60 days or longer,"
6605.202,there's some metabolic
changes,in the way that people
6608.195,metabolize energy that do seem
to,shift the system toward
6612.638,more fat loss relative to burning
of,other tissues when in a
6617.012,state of caloric restriction.
6619.15,And I want to say when in a
state,"of caloric restriction,"
6621.68,because there's really no
way,"to cheat the system,"
6623.97,there's no way that you can
ingest,far more calories than
6626.37,"you burn or excrete, when"
I,"say excrete, you know,"
6629.481,I certainly don't suggest
"this,","but there, you know,"
6632.279,bulimics and other people that
have,eating disorders will
6635.06,use laxatives at a way to
eliminate,food quickly from their
6637.497,system
6638.33,so it can't be converted into
fat,or other forms of energy.
6641.74,"That's a very, in that case,"
it's,"a pathological situation,"
6644.787,but in general calories
in,"versus calories out,"
6647.743,as I mentioned earlier as this
kind,"of foundational element,"
6650.72,"but in states of caloric restriction,"
6652.675,"meaning sub maintenance intake,"
6657.374,time-restricted feeding does
seem,to buy us more of the
6660.052,energy burned to compensate
for,that deficit from fat and
6664.999,the way it accomplishes
it,is very interesting.
6668.022,It turns out that it drives
more,fat loss by way of
6671.93,increasing a hepatic lipase.
6674.21,This is something called LAPC
hepatic,means of the liver and
6677.73,"lipase, which anytime you hear"
ASC,is means it's an enzyme.
6682.35,So it seems to increase hepatic lipase.
6684.2,So it increases the enzyme
that,metabolizes fat for
6687.605,lipolysis and energy production
and,reduces something called
6691.459,"CIDEC, CIDEC."
6694.44,which is a lipid droplet
associated,and lipolysis inhibitor.
6698.66,"Now that's a mouthful, no pun intended,"
6701.29,but what CIDEC really is
this,lipid droplet associated
6705.651,molecule is it can inhibit lipolysis.
6709.682,So extended periods of
"time,","restricted feeding,"
6713.509,meaning eight hour feeding
window,or 10 hour feeding window
6717.453,that's obeyed for several months
or,more seems to allow the
6721.871,system to shift toward burning
more,fat or rather using a
6728.663,higher percentage of fat
when,in a caloric deficit.
6732.718,Now I doubt that this is going
to,resolve the truly barbed
6737.14,"wire, almost hairball,"
6738.181,ridiculous online debates
about,whether or not
6740.88,time-restricted feeding is
better,than another feeding
6742.94,"schedule, look,"
6743.773,I don't think any particular
feeding,schedule is holy.
6746.18,"If you are sub caloric,"
6747.33,meaning fewer calories burned
than,"calories ingested,"
6750.18,you're going to lose weight.
6751.056,But the data seemed to point
to,the fact that if you do time
6753.81,restricted feeding for a
fairly,"long duration of time,"
6757.68,"and you maintain that,"
6759.04,that you are increasing
these,lipases that increase
6761.458,"lipolysis energy use from fat,"
6765.301,and you're decreasing the lipid
droplet,associated lipolysis
6769.063,inhibitors.
6770.36,So it's both a you're removing
the,break and you're pressing
6773.74,on the accelerator of fat loss.
6775.506,I think that this logically
points,to a case in which using
6780.328,time restricted feeding with
a,sub caloric intake seems to
6785.64,"be at least to my mind,"
6787.26,the most scientifically
supported,way to ensure that a
6790.048,significant portion of the
weight,that one loses is from
6792.946,body fat stores.
6795.55,Any discussion about fasting
would,be incomplete without a
6798.688,discussion about what does
and,does not break a fast.
6802.224,"However,"
6803.84,there is no black and white
answer,"to that question,"
6807.06,and you should immediately
understand,why it's because
6810.855,eating and not eating are not
equivalent,to fed and fasted.
6816.69,It depends on when you ate
how,much you ate and where you
6822.38,are in your circadian cycle.
6824.81,We can actually arrive at a
simple,answer to whether or not
6827.36,something breaks the fast or not.
6829.18,Now the technical way to go
about,this would be to wear a
6831.102,continuous glucose monitor
and,to ingest little bits of
6834.517,"food, of different kinds"
or,"large amounts of food,"
6837.25,of different kinds and
measure,"blood glucose,"
6839.85,because ultimately blood glucose
is,the readout of whether
6842.736,or not your system is in
a,fed or fasted state.
6844.797,"There are other parameters too, of course,"
6847.0,but that's the dominant one
6849.91,in so far as the scientific
literature,says drinking water
6855.442,will not break your fast
drinking,tea will not break your
6860.72,"fast drinking coffee,"
6862.52,provided it as black coffee
will,not break your fast
6866.94,ingesting caffeine in pill
form,will not break your fast.
6870.85,There are other things
that,won't break your fast.
6872.67,"For instance,"
6873.669,eating one peanut when deep in
a,fasted state will not break
6877.297,"your fast, eating a whole"
handful,of peanuts might not even
6880.84,break your fast if you are
in,a very low glucose state.
6884.75,"However,"
6885.583,if you just finished a meal
that,"included carbohydrates,"
6888.01,or it was a very large meal
of,"any kind an hour ago, yes,"
6891.638,"indeed, eating one peanut"
could,break your fast.
6895.84,"So it's all contextual, that's"
6898.16,"what's really important to understand,"
6899.379,unless you're going to wear
a,continuous glucose monitor.
6902.02,And unless you are going to
wear,a continuous glucose
6904.896,monitor and set an absolute
numerical,threshold for what it
6909.39,is to break your fast.
6910.659,I think there are some simple
rules,that we can follow.
6914.034,"First of all, anything that"
involves,"sugar in particular,"
6919.55,simple sugars can
potentially,break your fast.
6921.86,"And there's actually a study on this,"
6923.44,which shows that if
people,"ingest even one,"
6927.027,"one gram of sugar post dinner,"
6931.31,if they had a full meal for
dinner,that can actually disrupt
6934.94,the expression of some of the
circadian,genes related to
6938.201,fasting and to sleep and
sleep,related fasting.
6941.94,"Now that's pretty extreme,"
6943.0,"almost kind of scary to think about,"
6945.12,but that's how sensitive our system is.
6947.58,If we already have somewhat
elevated,blood glucose from a
6950.702,"meal that we ate an hour or so ago,"
6952.837,whereas if we have run
for,"an hour or train hard,"
6958.14,"high intensity training,"
6959.354,and we haven't quite reached
the,beginning of our so-called
6962.77,"feeding window, will eating"
a,small amount of food
6967.272,take us out of that fast?
6969.4,"Well, depends on what the food is."
6971.92,"If it's mostly fat,"
6973.19,"probably not, a number of"
people,out there nowadays
6975.99,"talk about so-called fat fasting,"
6977.75,fat fasting as a way to kind
of,regal past the stringency of
6982.599,either eating or not eating
as,a black and white rule for
6986.792,feeding window versus non feeding window.
6989.64,So some people will ingest
medium,chain triglycerides
6992.488,"so-called MCTs,"
6994.48,or people will ingest fats only
until,their official feeding
6997.159,window begins.
6998.97,So these are sort of how the
negotiations,that people carry
7001.082,out tend to go.
7002.348,But that of course won't increase
blood,glucose and insulin
7006.26,"as much as carbohydrates will,"
7007.92,protein will have sort of
an,intermediate effect.
7010.23,"And as I mentioned earlier,"
7012.09,ingesting carbohydrates with
some,fat will tend to blunt the
7015.105,rise in glucose and will
extend,the duration over which
7019.04,glucose is released.
7020.41,So we really can't say food X
or,"beverage X breaks a fast,"
7026.971,"however, at the extremes, we"
can,"say that, for instance,"
7030.105,"if you drink a can of soda pop,"
7033.384,"unless you just ran an ultra marathon,"
7035.624,"you're breaking your fast,"
"okay,","eat a piece of pizza,"
7038.69,"You're breaking your fast,"
you,"eat purely fats, maybe,"
7042.085,probably not.
7043.67,If you've been fasting for
five,hours or more strictly
7046.684,fasting for five hours or more.
7049.15,So you can start to see where
there's,a lot of wiggle room
7052.07,and it's very contextual.
7053.55,And this is why any posts that
you,see or any information
7056.532,that you see that something
does,or does not break your
7059.02,"fast,"
7060.233,that doesn't place it in the
context,of when the last time
7061.583,you ate and what you ate and
your,activity and your time
7066.576,within the circadian clock
schedule,"of 24 hours,"
7070.51,it's a sort of meaningless
"discussion,","so in general,"
7073.41,I think what's really useful
if,you're not going to wear a
7075.63,continuous glucose monitor is
to,try and be fairly strict
7079.192,about when you initiate your
feeding,window and when you
7082.1,stop your feeding window
and,as time evolves and you
7084.711,establish a more regular routine
of,eating certain kinds of
7087.86,foods and not others that are
right,for you because as I've
7089.845,"emphasized before on this podcast,"
7091.71,and I will continue to emphasize
keto,works great for some
7094.41,"people, vegetarian keto"
works,"great for some people,"
7097.29,carnivore diet works
great,for other people.
7099.349,"Some people are omnivores,"
some,"people are carnivores,"
7102.304,some people are vegan.
7103.854,All of that is great and fine by me.
7106.012,Everyone has to establish
what's,"right for them, today,"
7108.3,we've really bypass the
discussion,about foods of a
7112.91,particular origin or type
animal-based,or plant-based.
7116.29,But all the same rules apply
within,this thing that we're
7119.278,called intermittent fasting
or,time restricted feeding.
7122.79,So what breaks a fast will
depend,and what you want to eat
7126.074,or what you are willing to eat.
7128.25,That's a totally separate
manner,from when you eat.
7130.576,"But as we've established, when"
you,"eat is vitally important,"
7134.749,some of you are probably wondering
whether,or not artificial
7137.74,sweeteners or non artificial
plant-based,sweeteners like
7142.21,"Stevia break a fast,"
this,will vary somewhat.
7146.39,And I have to say the data
on,this are somewhat mixed.
7150.382,There is evidence that when
people,ingest artificial
7154.295,"sweeteners,"
7155.56,that it can create a transient
increase,in blood glucose
7158.79,followed by a transient
decrease,in blood glucose below
7162.56,baseline.
7163.507,This is thought to explain the
increase,in hunger caused by
7166.268,ingestion of things like
aspartame,and sucralose and things
7169.43,of that sort.
7170.39,There are not a lot of
good,studies exploring the
7172.542,plant-based non sugar
"sweeteners,","things like Stevia,"
7177.204,"even things like monk fruit,"
7179.39,which is a separate category unto itself.
7180.818,There aren't a lot of studies on this.
7183.09,I think most people need to
establish,this for themselves.
7184.776,"The best way of course,"
7186.04,would be to wear a continuous
glucose,monitor to go into a
7188.357,fasted state of either
one,"hour or two hours,"
7191.31,or maybe you've been fasting
all,night and then ingest
7193.109,Stevia in whatever form you
want,or coffee in whatever form
7196.876,you want with sucralose
or,"aspartame, et cetera,"
7199.68,setting aside the discussion
about,the effects of these
7203.16,"things on the gut microbiome,"
7204.162,which is a different topic entirely.
7206.422,I think it's fair to
say,"that in moderation,"
7209.179,the plant-based non sugar
sweeteners,like Stevia in
7213.199,"particular,"
7214.47,Stevia seemed to have a
minimal,impact on overall blood
7218.24,glucose when considered over
a,fairly large time been
7220.924,"aspartame, and sucralose, saccharin."
7223.314,"I think we can say more or less the same,"
7226.11,but as soon as you get into
a,"discussion about those,"
7227.96,you also have to get into a
discussion,about some of the
7229.99,evidence published in nature
and,other excellent journals
7234.22,now pointing to the fact
that,"when consumed in excess,"
7237.96,"not when consumed in moderation,"
7240.02,but when consumed in excess
that,those might have some
7242.07,detrimental effects on the gut microbiome.
7243.946,So do artificial sweeteners break a fast?
7247.387,It depends on the amount
depends,on the type.
7250.38,"And in general,"
7251.213,I think you're probably okay
provided,that you're not
7253.481,"indulging in them too often, however,"
7256.72,some people just by virtue
of,"tasting something sweet,"
7259.554,feel a spike in their appetite
that,makes it harder for them
7263.1,to adhere to the feeding window.
7264.75,And so this is why you can
imagine,that a really well
7267.043,controlled study on this would
be,very hard to carry out.
7270.31,And I'm not really sure that
it's,worth our tax dollars to
7272.615,actually design and carry
out,a study like that because
7275.329,there would be so much
individual,variation in terms of
7278.73,discipline in adhering
to,"the feeding window,"
7280.93,whether or not people experience
increases,and drops in
7283.85,"blood glucose, how that impacts them,"
7284.944,whether or not they're exercising.
7286.37,It just becomes an infinite
variable,"space, as we say,"
7289.239,in experimental science.
7291.01,So you really have to
determine,"that for you,"
7292.792,but I don't think that we can
fairly,say that artificial
7296.45,sweeteners break a fast.
7298.67,I think that would be
incorrect,"to say earlier,"
7300.439,we were talking about
glucose,"disposal agents,"
7303.157,both behavioral and compound
based,things like Metformin and
7307.72,"berberine, and in fact,"
7309.34,cinnamon is even a mild
glucose,disposal agent.
7312.12,It can actually reduce blood
"glucose,","lemon and lime juice,"
7316.05,"believe it or not, can"
lower,blood glucose.
7318.055,You may have experienced this
before,of eating something
7320.46,"very,"
7321.293,very sweet and almost feeling
kind,of overwhelming on a
7323.31,"poisoned by how sweet it is,"
7324.83,especially if you're not
accustomed,to eating a lot of
7327.49,sugary things.
7329.08,One quick remedy for that is
actually,a half lime or half
7332.128,lemon squeezed into juice and
drinking,that just by virtue
7334.597,of the taste and by virtue of
the,fact that it will reduce
7338.993,blood glucose.
7340.587,You'll notice that that
effect,almost immediately
7343.04,"disappears, that's not magic."
7344.625,That's the effects of acidity
on,blood glucose levels.
7348.566,So there are a number of
things,that can adjust blood
7351.65,"glucose, they're not"
necessarily,"disposal agents,"
7354.11,they're not sweeping it out
of,the bloodstream in the same
7356.45,"way that berberine or Metformin would,"
7358.16,or that high intensity exercise
at,the appropriate times of
7360.91,day would.
7361.743,But there is one particular
thing,that one can ingest that
7364.978,can help manage psychologically
and,performance wise through
7370.75,the fasting portion of the
intermittent,fasting and get you
7375.069,to your feeding window.
7376.671,And that's salt.
7378.576,I've talked a little bit about
this,"on the podcast before,"
7381.5,"but because neurons use salt,"
7384.76,"sodium and potassium and magnesium,"
7387.19,the so-called electrolytes in
order,to perform their magic
7390.54,"of chemical and electrical signaling,"
7392.18,"everything you do depends on chemical,"
7393.6,electrical signaling and all
that,chemical and electrical
7396.06,signaling requires electrolytes
in,some form or another
7399.86,neurons run on the passage of
ions,like sodium in and out of
7405.364,"their cell membranes are, I should say,"
7408.26,across their cell
membranes,to be accurate.
7411.28,Many people find that the
kind,"of lightheadedness,"
7414.07,the shakiness that's accustomed
with,having slightly low
7418.17,blood sugar can be offset by
taking,a half teaspoon or so of
7423.227,"sea salt,"
7424.66,or even just a tiny pinch of
salt,and putting into some
7427.01,water and drinking it.
7429.801,Some people find because of
the,glucose lowering effects of
7434.54,"acidity, that if they're feeling"
kind,"of shaky and not well,"
7436.98,and they put some lemon juice
into,water and drink that it
7439.86,drops their blood glucose further.
7441.404,So there's a common practice
nowadays,that's discussed on
7445.11,the internet of waking up
drinking,some water with some lime
7447.97,or lemon juice in it with
a,little pinch of salt.
7450.0,I think that little pinch
of,salt is a good idea.
7451.751,"What is it doing, how is"
it,offsetting all this?
7454.15,"Well,"
7455.18,salt water actually has a mild
effect,as a glucose disposal
7459.295,"agent, but it has a stabilizing"
effect,on blood volume.
7463.47,"And so,"
7464.4,because sodium brings with
it,water and the so-called
7467.725,osmolarity of your blood in
your,body depends on the salt
7471.69,levels in your blood and brain and body.
7475.456,Many people find that
they're,feeling shaky.
7478.08,They're feeling lightheaded.
They,can't concentrate.
7479.83,"They think they need sugar or food,"
7481.44,but what will actually
remedy,that is some salt.
7484.56,And I know a number of people
that,have incorporated this
7486.68,practice and have written to
me,"and saying, oh, you know,"
7488.45,if I just take a little
bit,"of salt in some water,"
7490.81,they may or may not include
the,lemon or lime juice.
7492.53,They immediately feel better
and,find that it's actually
7494.435,"quite straightforward to get out to that,"
7496.999,to wait until the feeding window kicks in.
7500.193,This is especially true for
people,that are using caffeine
7503.219,"because when you ingest caffeine,"
7505.23,"you actually excrete a lot of water,"
7506.98,it has a diarrhetic effect.
7508.31,And with that water goes salt.
7510.21,So it actually causes
you,to excrete sodium.
7511.886,Now the role of sodium in
blood,pressure and hypertension
7515.983,"is, you know, quite"
controversial,"science magazine,"
7519.311,one of the premier scientific
journals,out there had a
7522.884,special issue all about
salt,"some years ago,"
7526.09,talking about the research
around,"hypertension,"
7528.097,indeed people with chronic
hypertension,or high blood
7531.04,pressure or very high blood
pressure,in particular should be
7533.59,wary of ingesting too much sodium.
7535.52,But for most people ingesting
sodium,provided they drink
7538.881,enough water and they don't
have,chronic hypertension or
7542.53,high blood pressure is
actually,beneficial.
7545.64,Now that doesn't mean you
should,be drinking seawater
7547.27,doesn't mean you should
be,"overindulging in salt,"
7549.605,but many people find that they
can,manage their mental and
7553.84,physical state and even
feel,"really terrific,"
7555.684,"real clarity of mind,"
7558.05,and really enjoy their
fast,when they're ingesting
7560.91,sufficient salt.
7561.743,And all it requires really
is,"a small pinch of salt,"
7563.68,ideally Himalayan or sea salt.
7565.06,"If you want to get fancy about it,"
7566.19,but table salt would be fine.
7568.09,"And just drinking that in some water,"
7570.298,maybe with lemon or lime juice
to,offset the taste a little
7574.05,bit can really stabilize one's
jitters,and can stabilize the
7577.392,"mind, and you might also notice"
can,offset that churning and
7582.768,yearning and appetite where
you,can't imagine going another
7586.789,five minutes before eating
something,suddenly you feel okay.
7589.53,And that has to do with a lot
of,the effects of blood volume
7591.881,caused by ingesting salt
in,the appropriate amounts.
7595.4,"In other words, sometimes"
you,"think you need food,"
7597.833,but what you really need to
salt,and salt can make you feel
7600.56,better immediately.
7601.607,I'd like to mention too
excellent,zero cost resources.
7604.718,If you're going to explore
time,"restricted feeding,"
7607.66,or maybe if you already are
doing,"time restricted feeding,"
7610.85,I have no affiliation to either of these.
7613.312,The first is the website
that,"I mentioned before, My"
7615.69,"Circadian Clock,"
7617.02,which is the website hosted by
Satchin,Panda and colleagues.
7620.45,There are a lot of resources
there,where you can log your
7622.493,"food intake,"
7623.49,get information about
time-restricted,feeding all the
7625.6,"science, the ongoing studies, et cetera."
7627.52,The other is the so-called Zero app.
7630.015,That makes it very easy to
mark,when you're beginning your
7636.393,feeding window and when you're
ending,your feeding window
7639.48,"and in,"
7640.313,so doing marking when you are
beginning,your fast and ending
7642.18,"or fast,"
7643.38,where at least initiating the
beginning,"of the unfed state,"
7647.62,as we could more accurately
call,"it, it's a terrific app."
7650.259,I've used it from time to time.
7652.01,I don't tend to use it in an
ongoing,basis because I'm just
7654.027,sort of used to eating at a
particular,time of day now.
7657.847,But anytime I've shifted
that,"window, for instance,"
7660.702,"a few weeks ago,"
7662.022,I started moving that protein
intake,in my entire feeding
7665.51,window earlier in the day.
7666.539,And because that takes
some,"attention on my part,"
7669.565,because I'm not used to doing that.
7671.129,I've been using the Zero app
and,I like it quite a lot.
7674.13,It logs your progress and it
gives,you averages and you can
7676.39,see how many other
people,"are fasting again,"
7678.2,totally zero cost. I actually
don't,"know who owns that app,"
7680.354,but I think they've done an excellent job.
7683.15,The interface is really
"terrific,","and as far as I know,"
7685.66,"it's available for Apple and Android,"
7687.39,but it's at least
available,"for Apple phones,"
7689.36,which is the type of
phone,I happen to have.
7691.51,"So check those out, My Circadian Clock."
7694.213,You just put that into
"Google,",you'll find it.
7695.963,"And the Zero app, both"
excellent,zero cost resources.
7699.84,In a moment I'd like to review
the,parameters of a ideal
7704.155,feeding schedule for you and
give,you the variables that you
7708.36,can plug into your lifestyle
and,your preferences.
7710.769,There are a couple of things
that,I would place into the
7713.31,"category of frequently asked somewhat odd,"
7716.776,but still worthy of discussion.
7719.247,"For instance,"
7721.28,people have asked will brushing
your,"teeth with toothpaste,"
7724.6,break your fast?
7725.68,I think unless you're
swallowing,"the toothpaste, no."
7729.58,Now if you really want to
run,out and get a continuous
7731.56,"glucose monitor and brush your teeth,"
7733.06,"and you can evaluate that,"
7734.28,but no people have asked will
a,half glass of wine after
7737.968,dinner a couple hours after
dinner,break your fast.
7741.118,Absolutely.
7742.287,It absolutely will.
7743.74,And it's been demonstrated to
do,that based on the one gram
7747.87,"of sugar,"
7748.703,kind of eerie or scary effect
that,"I talked about before,"
7751.85,"scary and eerie,"
7752.683,because it just seems
like,one gram of sugar.
7755.18,How could it do that?
7756.013,But these are metabolic
processes,and they are very
7759.65,"sensitive, post-meal, a few months back,"
7762.451,I did an experiment wearing
a,continuous glucose monitor.
7766.081,And I got a surprise when I
discovered,that going into a
7769.572,sauna increases my blood
glucose,quite a bit.
7772.96,It actually spikes it as high as a meal.
7775.075,And then it tends to drop
back,down to baseline or even
7778.14,"slightly below baseline afterwards,"
7780.68,when I talk to people about
"this,","somebody said, oh,"
7784.16,it's got to be that the
continuous,glucose monitor was
7786.529,getting disrupted by
the,heat in the sauna.
7788.88,That's actually not the case.
7789.982,"Turns out that when you go in a sauna,"
7793.325,"because you dehydrate,"
you're,"losing water,"
7796.563,I wasn't drinking water and
you're,dropping a lot of water.
7799.935,The concentration of sugar in
your,blood actually goes up.
7802.944,And I actually put these data
out,in a social media post on
7805.657,"Twitter,"
7807.67,and people were kind of shocked
to,see how much a sauna can
7810.982,"spike your blood glucose,"
now,"I do practice time,"
7814.02,"restricted feeding, intermittent fasting."
7816.61,I'm not super strict about it.
7817.94,I use a kind of eight to 10
hour,ish window either early in
7820.362,the day or late in the day.
7823.439,I saw this effect of
the,"sauna, personally,"
7826.034,the psychological and physical
health,effects of the sauna
7830.611,are valuable enough to me
that,I continue to use it.
7834.427,I'm just not concerned about
this,"increase in blood glucose,"
7837.46,to the extent that I'm
going,to eliminate sauna.
7839.59,I like to use the sauna three
or,four times a week before
7842.188,"sleep, so I'll use it an"
hour,or two before sleep.
7844.88,"And yes,"
7845.713,indeed it creates this big
spike,in blood glucose that then
7848.0,drops based on change in the
concentration,of blood sugar.
7851.411,"I'm just not going to worry about it, now,"
7853.22,if you're concerned about
blood,"glucose spikes,"
7855.42,then you might be worried
about,"it, but in my case,"
7857.971,it was one of those things
where,it was interesting and it
7860.297,was worthy of discussion.
7862.86,I thought because it was
somewhat,"surprising to me,"
7864.62,although it makes perfect sense
why,"this would be the case,"
7866.85,"but at the end of the day, literally,"
7868.62,it just makes sense for
me,to get in the sauna.
7871.05,Okay. So now you've
heard,a lot of science.
7873.334,You've heard a lot of
"examples,","even a few anecdotes,"
7876.62,and let's come up with the
ideal,"intermittent fasting,"
7882.53,"AKA time, restricted"
feeding,schedule for you.
7886.52,"And when I say ideal, I mean,"
7888.42,what are the variables
that,are negotiable?
7890.72,What are the ones that are non-negotiable?
7892.867,What is ideal for you will
depend,on the context of your
7896.66,life and what you are
willing,to do consistently.
7899.54,"So, first of all,"
7903.02,we established based on the
discussion,"with Satchin,"
7906.13,who is truly the premier
world,"expert in this area,"
7909.44,who knows the animal and human
scientific,literature better
7913.86,than anybody has written
this,incredible review.
7915.844,And for whom I consulted that
7919.049,you do not want to ingest
food,for at least I want to
7923.37,emphasize at least 60 minutes
post,"waking up, second,"
7928.395,you want to avoid ingesting
any,"food of any kind,"
7933.246,"even one gram of sugar, remember,"
7935.56,this is the ideal one gram of
sugar,even would be too much
7938.766,for the two to three
hours,prior to bedtime.
7943.473,"He also mentioned, ideally,"
7945.586,you are spending eight hours in bed.
7948.5,I didn't tell you that
earlier.,"I saved that for now,"
7950.028,but ideally you are sleeping
that,"entire eight hours,"
7953.936,but simply by being in bed for
that,eight hours and avoiding
7956.826,food after waking for an hour
and,before bed for two to
7961.25,"three hours,"
7962.083,you're starting to build out
the,duration of this fasted
7964.644,period.
7967.335,Remember that the sleep
related,fasting is particularly
7972.9,important for the health
benefits,of time-restricted
7975.5,feeding.
7976.512,"Again,"
7977.345,the sleep-related fasting is
especially,important because of
7980.456,all the cellar repair processes
that,occur in the liver and
7984.582,"the gut in the microbiome, in"
the,brain all over the body.
7988.391,And because of the way that
that,coordinates the expression
7991.1,of the clock genes that are
then,going to wick out and have
7994.73,"many other positive effects on health,"
7997.72,including weight and fat loss.
8000.6,But in addition to that
liver,"health, et cetera,"
8003.856,an eight hour feeding window
as,a target seems to be the
8008.969,"best target feeding, at least"
by,my read of the literature.
8013.7,And in discussing it with
shuts,such in shorter feeding
8016.78,"windows of four to six hours,"
8018.32,tend to lead to overeating
and,potentially increases in
8021.587,weight.
8023.553,One meal per day type eating
do,"not seem to do that,"
8027.854,but those are special cases in
that,most people can't adhere
8032.345,"to a one meal per day type schedule,"
8034.775,at least not on a regular basis.
8037.16,And it's not very compatible
with,most social schedules.
8040.13,Although some people may be
able,to adhere to that in a
8042.083,"straightforward way,"
8043.34,but there aren't any robust
studies,exploring the advantages
8046.637,of one meal per day.
8048.902,So if you feel there are
advantages,of one meal per day for
8052.106,you as opposed to an
eight,"hour feeding window,"
8055.773,"well then by all means,"
8056.973,use a one meal per day approach
or,use a four to six hour
8060.202,feeding window and just make
sure,you don't overeat in that
8064.21,window.
8065.605,Remember that most people tend
to,not adhere to the eight
8070.87,"hour feeding window, they say eight hours,"
8072.385,but they tend to eat outside
of,the eight hours a little bit
8076.01,"on each side, so if your goal"
is,"a 10 hour feeding window,"
8080.945,you might want to set it to
nine,hours or eight hours.
8083.655,"If your goal is six hours,"
8085.54,you might want to set it
to,seven or eight hours.
8087.62,"And this is simply based by,"
8088.64,I shouldn't say simply
this,"is based on thousands,"
8091.492,if not tens of thousands of
human,subject data points that
8096.42,Satchin and colleagues have collected
8099.881,regular placement of the eating
window,"or feeding window,"
8105.77,every 24 hours is important.
8108.3,You don't have to be absolutely
rigid,and neurotic about
8111.14,"this,"
8111.973,but you don't want it sliding
around,on the weekends so that
8113.84,it starting two hours later
and,"ending two hours later,"
8116.302,"a couple days a week,"
8118.154,because then you start to offset
many,of the positive health
8122.695,effects that have been
demonstrated,for time restricted
8125.7,feeding.
8126.798,Remember if you eat your
food,within a certain feeding
8132.166,"window, but that feeding window"
shifts,"by a couple of hours,"
8135.599,it is effectively like
jet,lagging your system.
8138.926,It is effectively like traveling
a,couple times zones over
8142.364,eating there for a few days
and,coming back when in fact
8145.698,"you're not traveling,"
8148.421,that's because of the
way,"that food adjusts,"
8150.481,the circadian clock genes.
8152.7,Now you can offset some of
that,through the use of light.
8155.52,And I've talked extensively
about,how to use light in
8158.14,"previous podcasts, but again,"
8159.537,"early morning and all day bright,"
8161.97,light exposure as safely as
you,"can, ideally from sunlight,"
8164.51,"not through a window, et cetera,"
8166.01,avoiding bright light in
the,"middle of the night,"
8167.84,"extremely important for mood offsetting,"
8170.61,"metabolic dysfunction, et cetera,"
8172.404,"not incidentally Satchin's early work was,"
8176.283,he was one of the three
co-discoverers,of the cells in the
8180.91,"eye, the so-called melanopsin"
cells,that set the central
8183.39,circadian clock. So he was
a,"pioneer in that field,"
8186.23,which led him to be a pioneer
in,this field and so on.
8189.828,When should that eight hour
window,be placed within each 24
8194.337,"hour cycle? Well, let's"
talk,about ideal ideal.
8197.107,If you really want to maximize
all,the health benefits of
8202.909,"time-restricted feeding,"
8205.563,you need to extend the fast
around,sleep on both sides.
8210.16,You would place it smack dab
in,the middle of the day.
8212.332,It would be a schedule in
which,you started eating for
8215.98,instance at 10:00 AM. And you
stopped,eating at 6:00 PM.
8220.412,An absolutely dreadful schedule
for,anyone that wants to
8223.83,have some semblance of a
normal,"life. In my opinion,"
8226.588,it's not really compatible
with,most schedules.
8229.92,Although some people
might,"be able to do it,"
8231.8,maybe you and your family or
your,"friends, your, you know,"
8235.37,"you're eating a late breakfast or a,"
8236.861,and then you're having a
late-ish,lunch around 2:00 PM.
8240.17,And then you have dinner at six.
8241.48,And then assuming that you
go,to bed around nine 30 or
8245.11,"10:00 PM,"
8246.08,that is going to extract
the,maximum amount of weight
8250.956,related body fat related metabolic
factor,related aspects of
8257.59,"time, restricted feeding."
8259.6,Some people tend to fall into
a,category where they do best
8263.261,placing that feeding window
later,in the day and provided
8267.436,it. Doesn't run too close to your sleep.
8269.7,Remember you needed a two or
three,hour buffer before your
8271.79,"sleep,"
8272.623,where you're not ingesting
anything,that's in order to
8274.94,extract the benefits of
time-restricted,feeding.
8277.197,Well then starting your
feeding,window at 12:00 PM and
8282.09,ending at 8:00 PM plus or
minus,half an hour or so day to
8286.237,"day, it seems like a perfectly"
reasonable,schedule for some
8289.72,people starting at 2:00 PM
and,ending at 10:00 PM will be
8292.021,that schedule.
8293.641,"Of course,"
8295.1,you have to take into
consideration,when you exercise.
8297.633,If you exercise.
8299.197,"For instance, I like to exercise"
early,"in the day if I run,"
8302.451,or if I do some moderate or
light,"intensity exercise,"
8306.088,"regardless of what type of exercise it is,"
8308.49,I have no trouble waiting until
my,feeding window kicks in
8311.976,around noon or even 2:00 PM.
8313.957,But if I do high intensity
weight,"training, for instance,"
8317.23,"early in the day,"
8318.063,or if I run sprints and I do
that,at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM by
8321.139,"11:00 AM, I am very,"
8323.44,very hungry and it's hard
for,me to do other things
8326.503,"concentrate, et cetera."
8328.49,Now I'm not neurotic
about,my feeding window.
8330.78,"As I mentioned before,"
8331.63,I kind of let it expand and
contract,a bit around the eight
8334.047,"hour mark, and feel perfectly"
free,to do that too.
8337.1,"We're talking here in, in ideals,"
8338.92,"not in necessarily practicals,"
8341.84,but other people find that
they're,very hungry when they
8345.81,wake up early in the day.
8346.89,If you're one of these people
or,you're somebody who really
8349.908,is trying to emphasize hypertrophy
or,"maintenance of muscle,"
8354.67,then it does seem that ingesting
protein,early in the day is
8357.471,beneficial.
8358.844,That it can be more readily
converted,into muscle tissue.
8363.155,And this has been demonstrated
in,at least one study.
8366.52,There's another study underway.
8367.75,That's exploring this further
for,"people that are really,"
8371.0,really interested in hypertrophy
and,building muscle will
8373.15,then time-restricted feeding
is,usually not the way they go.
8376.03,"I mean, let's be honest."
8377.55,There are many people out
there,who are eating four more
8380.254,"meals per day,"
8381.35,and they're doing that
from,7:00 AM until 8:00 PM.
8383.904,I realized that not
everybody,is overweight.
8386.41,There is an obesity crisis. Indeed.
8387.632,"You know,"
8388.83,the percentage of obesity
and,non-alcoholic fatty liver
8392.08,"disease is just cosmic through the roof,"
8393.81,at least in this country and
in,"other countries as well,"
8396.023,this country meaning the US
but,other countries as well.
8401.098,"But there are of course,"
8402.35,people that are trying to gain
weight,through who don't want
8404.91,to lose weight or who are
trying,to maximize physical
8407.35,performance or hypertrophy
or,things of that sort.
8409.48,And so of course time-restricted
feeding,for them might be
8412.251,"as long as I'm awake, I'm eating."
8414.234,"And I, you know, I tip my hat"
to,"those people and just say,"
8418.47,"you know,"
8419.303,provided you understand what
you're,doing and the burden
8420.898,"that,"
8421.731,that places on some of the
other,"processes in your body,"
8423.63,"if that's right for you, then"
by,all means pursue that.
8426.38,Another thing that we can add
to,this summary or key points
8429.81,related to time restricted
feeding,"is the use of glucose,"
8433.66,"disposal, agents, and or behaviors."
8436.045,If you find that you've eaten
too,close to a period of time
8440.5,"in which you would prefer to be fasting,"
8442.17,that's when a 30 minute brisk
walk,or even modest walk after
8446.242,"eating can be beneficial,"
8449.039,ingesting some lemon juice
or,lime juice can help lower
8452.382,blood glucose somewhat.
8454.154,And then there are the things
like,Metformin and berberine
8457.379,"there,"
8458.25,even some supplements out
there,that combine things like
8460.62,"berberine cinnamon,"
8461.764,which can lower blood glucose
and,things like chromium and
8466.515,things that have a mild
effect,"on blood glucose,"
8469.16,but berberine and Metformin
are,very high potency glucose
8474.708,disposal agents.
8476.092,And I mentioned earlier why you
would,want to approach those
8478.74,with the appropriate level
of,caution and figure out the
8481.187,"dosages for you, and, and for some people,"
8483.47,the dosages will be zero
milligrams,is going to be ideal.
8486.307,And then of course we discussed
how,making sure that you're
8489.81,ingesting enough fluids in
particular,"water and salt,"
8492.682,especially if you're using
caffeine,in order to increase
8496.756,"your levels of alertness,"
8498.12,regardless of where that caffeine
source,"comes from coffee,"
8500.53,"tea, or otherwise,"
8501.699,that can cause the excretion
of,sodium and can lead to a
8505.09,"kind of shakiness,"
8506.0,a lightheadedness and the
feelings,of hunger that may or may
8510.67,not be related to blood glucose.
8512.968,Some people genuinely need to eat.
8515.03,I certainly would not
want,to see people getting
8516.83,hypoglycemic to the point
where,it's dangerous.
8518.837,Certainly if you are
"diabetic,","you, and in fact,"
8522.091,"for all people,"
8523.18,you should consult with your
physician,when exploring any
8527.45,major changes to diet or
additions,or subtractions of
8529.706,"anything, including supplementation,"
8531.088,but for most people maintaining
relatively,low to modest
8534.998,blood glucose levels is going
to,be pretty healthy and will
8540.58,allow all the positive effects
of,intermittent fasting to
8544.17,occur.
8545.24,And when you find that reaching
that,start to the feeding
8549.22,window is challenging that
ingesting,sodium can often
8553.38,stabilize your system
mentally,"and physically,"
8557.04,and allow you to reach that
window,often painlessly.
8559.959,"And then as a final point,"
as,"I mentioned earlier,"
8563.7,"provided that they are consumed in low,"
8566.548,"no or modest amounts,"
artificial,"sweeteners,"
8571.299,"or plant-based non sugar,"
8573.54,non caloric sweeteners don't
seem,to really impact blood
8577.22,glucose to the extent that
it,"would quote unquote,"
8579.55,"take you out of your fast,"
8581.214,but that like fat fasting is
something,that's going to be
8584.74,"highly individual,"
8585.81,and that you're going to
have,to experiment with for
8587.91,yourself and being able to
recognize,when you're in a fast
8592.049,"and when you're out of a fast,"
8594.13,at a subjective level and not
constantly,having to measure
8596.331,your blood glucose or do
things,of that sort can be
8599.318,beneficial.
8600.7,And I think if you watch for
the,feelings associated with
8603.257,eating and post eating foods
of,different kinds in different
8606.83,"amounts,"
8607.69,and you watch for the feelings
associated,with being fasted
8610.837,for long periods of time or
short,periods of time of having
8614.202,gotten sufficient sunlight
of,"having trained harder,"
8617.47,not trained hard earlier
that,"day, et cetera,"
8619.625,"you can do the most important thing,"
8621.5,"which is to start to learn,"
to,"evaluate your own system,"
8624.339,"to run simple,"
8625.92,safe experiments on your system
in,a way that allows you to
8628.746,really establish the ideal
nutrition,"schedule for you,"
8632.72,"whether it be time restricted, feeding,"
8634.72,"AKA intermittent fasting, or"
some,other nutritional plan.

8705.91,One issue with supplements and
the,supplement industry as a
