0.37,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.35,where we discuss science and science based tools 
4.93,for everyday life. 
9.27,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.21,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
12.92,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.73,"Today, we are going to discuss sugar, "
16.89,"in particular, how our nervous system regulates "
18.99,our sugar intake and our are seeking of sugar. 
22.13,We're also going to discuss how sugar 
24.33,regulates our nervous system. 
25.84,"And as you'll soon learn, "
27.28,sugar really impacts our brain and body 
29.09,by two main mechanisms. 
30.95,One of those mechanisms is based on 
32.62,"the sweet taste of sugar, which itself is rewarding. "
35.97,"Even if you're not much of a sweet tooth, "
37.66,"I confess I'm not, "
39.09,most people enjoy sweet tastes more than bitter tastes. 
43.13,"And the sweet taste of sugar and its various forms, "
46.94,"is strongly reinforcing, "
48.51,"meaning it triggers the activation of neurons, "
50.82,"nerve cells in the brain and body, "
52.33,that make us want to consume more of that sweet substance. 
56.07,"Incidentally, sweet tastes also make us want to eat more of "
59.49,other substances as well. 
61.17,You may be familiar with that phenomenon. 
62.98,Now sugar also triggers mechanisms in the brain and body 
65.84,"based on its nutritive content, "
67.9,independent of its sweetness. 
69.72,What that means is that the actual caloric content 
74.05,and the way that sugar interacts with your nervous system 
76.82,"at a subconscious level, without your awareness, "
79.91,also impacts your craving and seeking 
82.06,of sugar and other foods. 
84.5,"Today, we are going to discuss what happens "
86.53,when you ingest sugar in terms of your body's reaction 
90.06,and your brain's reaction. 
91.67,We are also going to talk about what happens 
93.07,when you don't ingest enough sugar. 
95.43,'Cause it turns out sugar is such a powerful fuel 
98.5,for the brain 
99.34,that under conditions where people don't ingest 
101.43,"enough sugar, or where their so-called blood glucose, "
104.4,which is basically blood sugar of a particular form 
107.0,"gets too low, their neurons don't function as well. "
110.7,"That said, there are conditions of very low blood sugar "
113.53,in which neurons can function even better. 
116.23,"So today we are going to talk about the ins and outs, "
118.58,the ups and downs of sugar 
119.98,as it relates to your nervous system. 
121.48,"And by the end of this episode, "
122.94,I'm confident that you have a much clearer picture 
125.34,"as to how much sugar you should be ingesting, "
128.61,whether or not you should avoid sugars 
130.44,"that you're currently eating, "
131.74,"and you will certainly understand much, much more "
134.34,"about the energy and fuel sources that your brain relies on, "
137.77,which I'm certain will allow you to make 
139.75,better informed choices about the foods you eat and avoid 
142.61,"toward mental health, physical health, and performance. "
145.33,I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events 
147.98,this May. 
148.98,"The first live event will be hosted in Seattle, Washington "
151.72,on May 
17th.,
153.2,The second live event will be hosted 
154.8,"in Portland, Oregon on May "
18th.,
157.2,Both are part of a lecture series entitled 
159.21,"The Brain-Body Contract, "
160.77,during which I will discuss science and science based tools 
163.83,"for mental health, physical health and performance. "
166.44,And I should point out that while some of the material 
168.89,I'll cover will overlap with information covered here 
171.56,"on the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
172.987,and on various social media posts. 
175.01,Most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct 
178.19,from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere. 
181.08,"So once again, it's Seattle on May "
"17th,",
183.61,Portland on May 
"18th,",
184.94,you can access tickets by going to Hubermanlab.com/tour. 
189.02,And I hope to see you there. 
190.52,"Before we begin, "
191.4,I'd like to emphasize that this podcast 
193.03,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
195.63,It is however part of my desire and effort 
197.52,to bring zero cost consumer information 
199.49,about science and science related tools 
201.39,to the general public. 
202.74,"In keeping with that theme, "
204.0,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
206.74,Our first sponsor is Thesis. 
208.75,"Thesis makes what are called nootropics, "
211.05,which means smart drugs. 
212.8,"Now, to be honest, "
213.633,"I am not a fan of the term nootropics, "
216.13,I don't believe in smart drugs 
218.07,in the sense that I don't believe 
219.24,that there's any one substance or collection of substances 
222.09,that can make us smarter. 
223.78,"I do believe, based on science, however, "
226.13,that there are particular neural circuits 
227.67,"and brain functions that allow us to be more focused, "
230.21,"more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera. "
233.93,"That's just the way that the brain works, "
235.33,different neural circuits for different brain states. 
237.84,And so the idea of a nootropic that's to make us smarter 
240.32,"all around, "
241.153,fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things. 
244.26,"If you're an artist, you're a musician, "
245.64,"you're doing math, you're doing accounting, "
247.73,"at different parts of the day, you need to be creative. "
249.38,These are all different brain processes. 
251.6,Thesis understands this. 
253.09,And as far as I know they're the first nootropics company 
255.44,to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes. 
258.72,"They only use the highest quality ingredients, "
260.28,which of course is essential. 
261.62,"Some of those I've talked about on the podcast, "
263.31,"things like DHA, Ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine. "
267.2,They give you the ability to try several different blends 
269.27,"over the course of a month, "
270.53,discover which nootropics work best 
272.27,for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals. 
275.56,"And with that personalization, "
277.5,design a kit of nootropics 
279.46,that's ideal for the different brain and body states 
281.81,you want to access. 
282.86,"I've been using Thesis for more than six months now, "
285.16,and I can confidently say that their nootropics 
286.743,have been a total game changer. 
288.78,"My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula, "
291.46,"or sometimes I'll use their Energy Formula, before training. "
294.6,"To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, "
296.63,go online to take thesis.com/huberman. 
299.56,Take a three minute quiz 
300.56,and Thesis will send you four different formulas 
302.55,to try in your first month.

310.01,Today's episode is also brought to us 
311.5,"by Athletic Greens, now called AG"
1.,
314.44,Athletic Greens is an all in one 
316.01,"vitamin, mineral and probiotic drink. "
318.41,I've been taking Athletic Greens since 
"2012,",
321.28,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
323.73,The reason I started taking Athletic Greens 
325.197,and the reason I still take Athletic Greens 
326.87,once or twice a day is that it helps me cover 
329.15,all of my basic nutritional needs. 
330.91,It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. 
333.41,"In addition, it has probiotics, "
335.42,which are vital for microbiome health. 
338.03,I've done a couple of episodes now on the so-called 
340.66,gut microbiome and in the ways in which 
343.28,"the microbiome interacts with your immune system, "
345.75,"with your brain to regulate mood, "
347.65,and essentially with every biological system 
349.81,relevant to health throughout your brain and body. 
352.57,"With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need, "
354.35,"the minerals I need, "
355.35,and the probiotics to support my microbiome. 
358.13,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
359.52,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
362.17,and claim a special offer. 
363.64,"They'll give you five free travel packs, "
365.41,which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
367.13,while you're on the road. 
368.26,Plus a years supply of Vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
372.113,There are ton of data now showing that vitamin D
3,
373.9,is essential for various aspects 
375.73,of our brain and body health. 
377.02,"Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, "
379.12,many of us are still deficient in vitamin D
3.,
381.5,And K
2,is also important because it regulates things like 
384.07,"cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. "
387.47,"Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman "
390.27,to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs 
392.75,and the year's supply of Vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
395.47,Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
398.47,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
401.07,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
403.69,to help you better understand your body 
405.26,and help you reach your health goals. 
407.15,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
409.92,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
412.26,that impact your immediate and long term health 
414.32,can only be assessed with a quality blood test. 
416.85,What's unique about InsideTracker 
418.05,is that while there are a lot of different tests out there 
420.72,"for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera, "
423.41,"with InsideTracker, "
424.243,"you get the numbers back in terms of your levels, "
426.54,but they also give you very clear directives 
428.56,"in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation, "
431.27,that can help you bring those values into the ranges 
433.9,that are best for you and your health goals. 
435.98,And that's very different than a lot of the other programs 
438.22,"where you get a lot of information, "
439.053,but you don't really know what to do with that information. 
441.38,InsideTracker makes that all very easy to understand 
444.04,and very actionable based on the very easy to use 
446.93,dashboard at InsideTracker. 
448.64,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "

457.58,"Okay, let's talk about sugar, "
459.3,"let's talk about how sugar impacts your brain, "
461.63,and how your brain impacts your pursuit or your avoidance 
464.8,of sugar. 
466.31,Let's get a few things out of the way first. 
468.44,The first thing is that there's nothing 
470.15,inherently bad about sugar. 
472.41,"I know the word sugar gets a bad rap nowadays, "
475.4,"and indeed, you're going to hear over and over again, "
477.68,"during this podcast, "
478.87,"that consuming a lot of refined sugars, "
481.34,"in particular high fructose corn syrup, "
483.68,is known to have a very large number of bad effects 
487.41,on the brain and body. 
488.33,I don't know that there's anyone 
489.49,that really debates that anymore. 
491.71,"Even if we just agree, and I think we should all agree, "
495.47,"on the so-called calories in, calories out principle, right? "
498.81,It's a principle thermodynamics 
500.38,"that if we ingest more energy than we burn, "
503.44,we are going to gain weight. 
504.56,"If we ingest less energy than we burn, "
507.43,we are generally going to lose weight. 
509.17,"And if the two things are in balance, "
511.4,"ingestion and burning of energy, "
514.38,"well, then we're going to maintain weight. "
516.61,"So everyone agrees on that, I agree on that. "
519.16,"But beyond, there are a number of ways "
521.67,"in which particular nutrients, "
523.48,"in the case of today's episode, sugar, "
525.82,"impact the way that the brain works, "
528.46,such that we tend to seek out more of particular nutrients. 
532.41,"For instance, if we eat sugar, "
534.74,"there are two, or at least two mechanisms, "
537.42,by which we will crave more sugar. 
539.53,"I think most people are aware of that experience, "
541.18,but today I'm going to explain exactly how that works. 
543.69,But also that when we ingest sugar 
546.6,it has a bunch of different effects 
548.25,on the way that our neural circuits work 
550.97,"that can allow us to be more or less focused, "
553.58,"more or less agitated, a more or less happy, "
556.32,more or less depressed in some cases. 
559.77,"So today, as we explore this thing we're calling sugar, "
561.937,we are going to explore that mainly in the context 
564.68,"of the nervous system, "
566.06,but also in the context of how 
567.72,the nervous system regulates 
569.11,"many, many functions and behaviors "
571.29,"that are important to all of you, "
573.33,"your ability to think, your ability to extra size, "
575.53,"your ability to gain weight, lose weight, "
577.34,"whatever your goals might happen to be, "
579.66,sugar plays a critical role in achieving those goals. 
582.85,"And in some cases, "
584.2,if you're ingesting too much at the wrong times 
586.16,"or the wrong forms, sugar can actually impede those goals. "
589.62,"In fact, sugar can prevent all the right behaviors "
592.62,from allowing you to achieve the goals that you want. 
595.47,So today we are going to place sugar 
597.0,into its proper context. 
599.07,The way I want to start off by doing that 
601.13,is to tell you a little bit of what happens when we eat 
604.26,and a little bit of what the brain does 
606.84,to respond to those events. 
609.49,So what happens when we eat? 
610.9,"Well, I've done an entire episode on metabolism. "
614.52,So if you're interested in the full cascade 
617.72,"of hormonal and neural events that occurs when we eat, "
620.86,please check out that episode. 
622.41,"But for the sake of today's discussion, "
624.05,"let's just take a, what I call top contour view "
626.94,of the hormonal response to ingesting food. 
630.2,"Now, anytime we eat, "
631.76,that is the consequence of a number of things 
633.51,that happened before we ate. 
636.01,"There's a own in our brain body called Ghrelin, "
638.53,spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N. 
640.99,Ghrelin is a hormone that increases 
644.09,depending on how long it's been since we ate last. 
646.89,"So the longer it's been since we had a meal, "
649.75,"Ghrelin levels are going to be higher and higher and higher, "
652.68,and it essentially makes us hungry 
654.36,by interacting with particular neurons 
656.81,in an area of the brain called 
657.927,the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus 
660.42,"and some other areas as well, like the lateral hypothalamus. "
663.8,"You don't need to know the names of those brain areas, "
665.43,"but if you'd like to know them, there they are "
668.39,"Ghrelin increases, it tends to make us hungry. "
671.58,"And then when we eat, "
673.5,typically what happens is Ghrelin levels go down. 
676.51,So it's a very logical system. 
678.26,"Now, when we eat, assuming that we eat carbohydrates, "
682.21,"but even if we just eat some protein and some fats, "
685.0,"we will experience a slight, or in some cases, "
688.5,"a large rise in blood glucose, "
691.06,blood glucose is simply blood sugar. 
693.7,"And the body and brain, we should say in particular, "
697.71,the nervous system doesn't function well 
700.06,if blood sugar is too high or too low. 
702.31,"So as a consequence, we have another hormone, "
704.37,"which is released from the pancreas, "
705.69,"which is called insulin, "
706.84,which helps regulate the amount of glucose 
709.67,in the bloodstream. 
710.63,"So even if you were to ingest an entire cup, "
713.89,"an eight ounce cup of pure table sugar, "
716.09,"which would send your blood glucose very, very high, "
718.69,"assuming that you have a normal insulin response, "
720.54,"that you're not diabetic, "
722.35,that insulin response would help clamp 
724.52,that blood glucose level so that it did not cause 
727.48,damage to your brain and body. 
729.76,"Because if blood sugar goes too high, "
731.33,"it's actually toxic to neurons and other cells of your body, "
734.15,it can kill them off. 
735.16,"And neurons of the central nervous system, "
737.32,"meaning the brain and spinal cord, "
738.45,"once they are dead, they do not come back. "
740.35,So your biological systems understand this 
743.58,"at a biological level that is, "
745.29,"and prevent that death of cells due to high blood sugar, "
748.63,"by keeping insulin around, "
751.38,in order to clamp blood glucose. 
753.54,"Diabetics, we call them type one diabetics, "
755.71,"who don't make insulin, "
756.86,"have to take insulin when they eat in particular, "
758.98,"when they eat foods that raise their blood sugar, "
760.98,specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity 
762.777,and the other deleterious effects of high blood sugar. 
765.66,So Ghrelin is a hormone that goes up 
767.38,"the longer it's been since we've eaten, "
769.11,it tends to stimulate hunger. 
771.25,"When we eat, Ghrelin is suppressed. "
773.68,"Blood glucose typically goes up, "
775.54,especially when we eat a carbohydrate containing meal. 
779.29,"When blood glucose goes up, it's regulated in the body, "
782.47,meaning its peaks and its valleys 
784.77,"are more or less smoothed out, "
786.65,"and that glucose is sequestered, "
788.43,it's taken away where it needs to be taken away. 
791.02,"And in certain locations, it's delivered to cells "
793.39,so that those cells can use the glucose. 
795.99,"Now, one of the chief organs for glucose utilization "
799.24,"is the brain, "
800.62,neurons are tremendously metabolically active. 
803.79,And their preferred mode of metabolism 
807.44,is glucose metabolism. 
808.85,"In other words, neurons basically run on sugar, "
812.05,which is not to say that you should eat a lot of sugar. 
814.67,"As you'll see today, there are states of mind and body, "
817.84,"for instance, fasted states, "
819.54,in which people report having immense amounts 
822.58,of mental clarity and their blood glucose 
824.95,is actually quite low. 
826.37,So it is simply not the case that the more sugar 
829.0,"that you ingest, the better that your brain will function. "
831.73,"But it is the case that for most people, "
833.96,meaning people who are not on a ketogenic 
835.75,"or very low carbohydrate diet, "
837.35,"they're not adapted to low carbohydrate diets, "
839.5,that neurons in their brain and body 
842.1,are using glucose in order to function. 
844.1,That's what allows those neurons 
845.34,"to fire electrical potentials, that's how we refer to it, "
847.77,"firing, meaning sending electrical signals down their length "
851.1,to communicate with other neurons. 
853.26,To illustrate just how important glucose is 
855.49,"for brain function, "
856.94,"I'd like to describe a study that just recently came out, "
860.36,that sits on a long history of similar studies. 
863.14,But the one that just came out is particularly interesting. 
865.6,"Now I want to point out that, unless I say otherwise, "
870.02,"I'm going to refer to typical diets, "
872.82,meaning I have to believe that most people out there 
875.68,are in ingesting some starch some starch or carbohydrate. 
877.99,I do realize there are people following 
879.59,very low carbohydrate diets 
881.16,or moderately carbohydrate diets. 
882.69,I even know that there's some folks out there 
883.97,"who are on the so-called carnivore diet, "
885.62,"they only eat meat and organs, maybe a little fruit. "
888.6,But I'm going to assume that the vast majority 
890.7,of people listening ingest proteins and carbohydrates. 
895.13,"So unless I say ketogenic, or I emphasize ketosis itself, "
898.92,"which I will, "
899.89,I'm referring to a kind of typical diet 
901.45,"where people are consuming fats, proteins and carbohydrates. "
904.56,I count myself as one such individual. 
907.72,"At some point I might try the carnivore diet, who knows, "
910.04,"I might I a pure vegan diet, who knows. "
912.72,"But for my entire life up until now, I'm "
46,"years old, "
915.76,"I've been a proud omnivore, "
917.67,"meaning I've tried to eat high quality as much as I can, "
921.02,"unprocessed foods, "
922.08,I try and really avoid highly processed foods. 
923.96,"But I do eat from those three macronutrient groups, "
926.24,"proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, "
928.19,and I'm going to assume that most of you do as well. 
930.86,"The study I'd like to emphasize, "
933.89,"recorded from neurons, nerve cells, "
936.12,"in the brain, in particular in the part of the brain "
939.297,"`that responds to visual images, "
941.7,the so called visual cortex. 
943.22,"And neurons in the visual cortex are beautifully tuned, "
947.34,"as we say, to particular features of what we see. "
952.05,"The primary example of this, "
952.883,"the kind of classic example, "
955.06,is if you put a little electrode next to a neuron 
957.62,"in your visual cortex, "
959.26,"or if we put you into an FMRI scanner machine, "
963.08,"which can detect neural activity, "
964.59,"and I were to show you a bunch of just little lines, "
968.93,"bars of light, they could be dark bars of light, "
970.81,"they could be light bars of light, "
973.47,on a screen in front of you. 
974.69,"So some would be vertical, some would be horizontal, "
976.64,some would be at 
45,"degrees, "
978.41,"what we would see is that some neurons respond best, "
983.17,meaning they fire a lot of electrical activity 
985.8,"to vertical lines, "
986.74,"other ones respond to horizontal lines, "
988.79,and others respond to 
45,degree lines. 
991.67,"And this so called orientation tuning, "
994.27,"meaning because of the orientation of the line, "
996.1,is a cardinal classic feature of the way 
999.32,that your visual system is built. 
1001.18,"And everything that you see, "
1003.59,"whether it's a face or a dog or a cat or a landscape, "
1007.01,is built up from these very simple neuron responses. 
1011.21,"In other words, when you look at a face, "
1013.62,there are neurons deep in the brain that respond to faces. 
1016.17,But the only reason that those neurons 
1017.95,can respond to those faces 
1019.24,is because they receive signals from neurons 
1021.21,in your visual cortex. 
1022.85,"Some of which respond to vertical lines, "
1024.5,"some of which respond to horizontal lines, "
1025.837,and some which respond to 
45,degree lines. 
1028.26,And all of those are built up 
1030.06,"in what we call a hierarchical representation, "
1032.03,which just fancy language for those are the building blocks 
1034.23,by which you see a face and you recognize a face. 
1036.71,"And it's really an amazing phenomenon, "
1038.2,"it happens very, very fast. "
1039.76,"You never notice that you're doing this, "
1041.46,but everything is built up from these 
1042.75,fundamental orientation-tuned neurons. 
1046.08,Now orientation-tuned neurons are so fundamental 
1050.12,that they are the building blocks 
1051.87,"by which you make up all other things that you see, "
1054.95,"it's the way you read, "
1055.783,"it's the way that you recognize faces, as I mentioned, "
1058.08,and everything else. 
1061.03,"Experimentally, it's quite straightforward "
1063.2,to measure how sharply tuned one of these neurons is. 
1067.23,"In other words, if I were to show you a vertical line "
1070.33,and find a neuron in your brain 
1071.73,"that responds to vertical lines, "
1073.65,I could also ask whether or not that neuron fires 
1077.49,any electrical activity in response to a line 
1080.65,"that's not quite vertical, "
1082.17,maybe just 
10,degrees off vertical or 
20,degrees 
1085.21,or 
30,degrees. 
1086.11,And what I eventually would find is that that neuron 
1088.67,was orientation-tuned over a particular range of angles. 
1093.1,"It's not only going to respond to vertical lines, "
1095.27,it's also going to respond to lines 
1096.61,that are about 
10,"degrees off vertical on either side, "
1099.33,"but probably not much more, maybe "
"20,",
1102.28,but usually it's going to be anywhere from vertical 
1105.06,to just tilted slightly. 
1108.903,In the recent experiment that was published 
1110.94,"in the journal, ""Neuron,"" Cell Press journal, "
1112.57,"excellent journal, "
1113.92,"the authors asked a really interesting question, "
1116.2,"they asked whether or not the sharpness of tuning, "
1118.96,the precision of orientation tuning of these neurons 
1121.98,is dependent on blood glucose level. 
1124.82,"So just to cut to the chase, to give you the answer, "
1127.13,"what they found is that when subjects are well fed, "
1131.25,"neurons that responded to vertical, "
1133.22,"responded very strongly to vertical, "
1135.07,"but not very much at all to other angles, "
1137.87,"of what we call stimuli, "
1139.7,so lines that are 
10,degrees or 
20,degrees off. 
1143.14,"If they looked at neurons that were primarily tuned, right, "
1146.39,"that preferred horizontal lines, they found the same thing. "
1149.8,So it wasn't something unique to vertical lines. 
1151.42,"What they basically found was the sharpness, "
1153.69,"the precision of tuning of neurons in the brain, "
1156.55,was best when subjects were fed. 
1159.89,"And conversely, when subjects were fasted, "
1162.92,the orientation tuning of these neurons became much broader. 
1167.64,What it meant was that a neuron 
1169.04,that normally would only respond to vertical 
1171.01,now responded to other angles of lines as well. 
1173.76,"You might say, well, that's great, right, "
1175.3,these neurons that at one point could only do one thing 
1177.1,are now tuned to other things. 
1178.16,But it's not so great because what that means 
1181.1,"is that in the fasted state, "
1183.62,"your perception of the outside world is actually distorted, "
1187.53,"it's blurred, it's not as precise as it is when you're fed. "
1191.28,"And when I say fed, "
1192.45,what I really mean is when glucose is available to neurons. 
1195.55,"Now, for some of you, maybe many of you, "
1198.43,"and including myself, intermittent fasting, "
1201.38,"or some variant thereof, is actually a state that I like. "
1204.21,It allows me to focus. 
1205.25,"For instance, as I mentioned before, "
1206.95,"and even earlier in this podcast, "
1208.19,I tend to eat my first meal sometime around 
11:,
00,AM. 
1211.7,And then I generally eat my last meal 
1213.82,sometime around 
8:,
00,"PM, plus or minus an hour "
1216.0,"on either side, I'm not super strict about it. "
1217.61,And occasionally I'll wake up really hungry 
1219.01,and I'll eat something before 
11:,
00,AM. 
1220.55,I'm not super strict about this intermittent fasting thing. 
1223.95,"It just seems to be how my appetite works best, "
1226.29,"given my schedule, et cetera. "
1229.43,"In the morning, I tend to be most focused. "
1231.93,And I always associated that with the fact 
1234.22,that I was fasted. 
1235.27,I ingest water and some caffeine about 
1237.37,
90,"minutes after waking up, I drink my caffeine, "
1239.47,"but I hydrate from the time I get up, et cetera, et cetera. "
1241.8,And I know a lot of other people 
1243.8,have had the experience of being fasted 
1245.86,and feeling like they have a lot of mental clarity. 
1248.49,"When you are in a fasted state, "
1250.34,typically you are going to use fuels 
1253.01,"that are available to the neurons, "
1254.87,"based on your intake of food the day before, "
1257.94,"maybe you're using some glycogen, "
1259.73,"maybe you're using some fat, "
1261.32,"maybe you're using some blood sugar, "
1263.25,that's derived from other storage sites in the body. 
1266.15,You don't actually use fat as a fuel source 
1269.49,for neurons under typical conditions. 
1271.52,But there are ways in which proteins and fats 
1273.83,"and glycogen, et cetera, are converted into fuel "
1276.6,that neurons can use. 
1278.17,What's interesting about this study 
1279.69,"is that the study says that when well fed, "
1283.29,"meaning when blood glucose, sugar, "
1285.86,"is at a properly elevated level in the bloodstream, "
1290.5,it can be delivered to the brain 
1292.2,"in a way that allows neurons to work best, "
1294.15,which is really all just to underscore the point 
1296.23,"that I made earlier, "
1297.063,which is that your nervous system 
1298.33,"is extremely metabolically demanding, and it loves glucose, "
1301.93,neurons love glucose. 
1304.15,So the takeaway from this study 
1306.03,"is not that you should avoid fasting, "
1308.02,the takeaway from this study 
1308.96,is that there are elements of the fasted state 
1311.34,in particular the elevations in things 
1312.82,"like epinephrine and norepinephrine, "
1314.47,"also called adrenaline and noradrenaline, "
1316.68,that can give us this kind of clarity of mind 
1318.873,that many people are pursuing when they fast. 
1321.56,"That's kind of one of the reasons a lot of people fast, "
1323.41,"they like the way that they feel, mentally and physically. "
1326.54,But I think it's only fair to point out 
1329.52,that glucose is the preferred source of fuel for the brain. 
1332.4,And this study that I mentioned is one of many studies 
1335.41,that have explored how nutritional status 
1337.73,or blood glucose status in the brain and body 
1340.13,influence neuronal tuning and neuronal function. 
1343.28,"And it really points to the fact that ultimately, "
1346.96,"your brain as an organ, is a glucose consuming machine. "
1351.07,"Now, when you eat a food, "
1354.16,"that food is broken down and if it contains carbohydrates, "
1357.68,it's going to be converted into glucose. 
1359.46,And that glucose can't get directly into the brain 
1361.67,as a fuel source. 
1362.503,It actually has to be carried across 
1363.83,"the so-called blood brain barrier, the BBB, "
1366.7,and the actual metabolism of glucose 
1370.13,and the delivery of the glucose to the neurons 
1372.41,is carried out by a different cell type. 
1374.38,And it's a cell type that you should all know about 
1376.14,"because it's the most abundant cell type in your brain, "
1379.38,"and maybe even in your entire nervous system, "
1381.16,and that's the so-called astrocyte. 
1383.22,"Astrocytes are one of several types of glia, "
1386.41,the word glia means glue. 
1388.12,"But many people have taken that name, glia, glue, "
1391.63,"to think that, oh, "
1392.74,the only thing that the astrocytes are doing 
1393.643,is just kind of holding things together. 
1395.5,"Actually, the astrocytes are involved in delivering "
1398.17,"glucose to the neurons, "
1399.7,they are critically involved in shaping 
1401.76,"your neuronal function and brain plasticity, "
1404.01,the brain's ability to change in response to experience. 
1406.2,So these astrocytes are like the little 
1407.75,waiters and waitresses bringing glucose to the neurons 
1410.777,and the neurons are going to do the heavy lifting 
1412.57,that's involved in perception and behavior and action. 
1416.29,"So if prior to this episode, "
1417.62,"you didn't already realize that glucose, blood sugar, "
1420.81,is vital to the function of your brain 
1423.53,"and other neurons of your nervous system, now you know. "
1426.93,And for those of you that have experienced 
1429.66,the increase in mental clarity 
1432.18,"that comes after a properly timed, properly composed, "
1437.35,"meaning it has the right macronutrients in the right ratios, "
1439.65,"and a properly sized meal, "
1441.73,well then now you have justification 
1443.56,for eating something as a way to improve the way 
1446.54,that your brain works. 
1447.373,It turns out that your brain is going to work best 
1449.06,"when it's got glucose available, "
1450.85,"whether you like to fast or not, "
1452.35,that's just the reality of things. 
1453.88,The same thing is also true for the neurons in your body. 
1457.41,"The way that you are able to move the limbs of your body, "
1459.77,the way you are able to perform exercise 
1462.65,"or movement of any kind for that matter, "
1464.8,"is because as neurons, called motor neurons, "
1467.43,"send electrical potentials to the muscle fibers, "
1470.21,"they release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, "
1472.57,"which causes contraction in the muscle fibers, "
1474.48,and allows you to move your limbs. 
1476.73,"Those neurons are also very metabolically demanding, "
1479.59,especially when you're doing 
1481.21,"demanding types of physical work, "
1482.627,and that could be cycling or running or weightlifting 
1484.57,or yoga or whatever it may be. 
1486.94,Those neurons require a ton of glucose. 
1490.44,If you've ever had the experience of having to 
1492.46,think very hard about how you're generating a movement 
1495.38,"or force yourself to continue to endure in a given exercise, "
1499.45,"you might have thought, "
1500.283,"oh, you know, I'm running out of fuel, "
1501.96,"that's why I'm getting tired, it's hard to do. "
1504.32,"That's actually the case sometimes, "
1506.44,but that's not always the case. 
1509.12,One of the reasons that it feels like work 
1511.31,"is because your so called upper motor neurons, "
1513.37,the ones that control the lower motor neurons 
1514.96,"in your spinal cord, which control your muscles, "
1517.21,they have to be very metabolically active. 
1519.11,It's one thing to engage in a reflexive movement 
1521.17,where you're just walking around 
1522.22,or if you're running continuously. 
1523.82,"But when you suddenly have to focus on what you're doing, "
1525.99,and you have to generate specific patterns 
1527.82,"of motor movement, "
1528.88,"well, that feels demanding because one, "
1532.44,it increases the release of adrenaline 
1534.15,"in your brain and body, "
1534.983,"which makes you feel a little bit agitated and more alert, "
1537.2,"but also deliberate thought, "
1540.18,deliberately controlling the way 
1541.75,"that your brain and body is moving, "
1543.93,"requires more glucose uptake, "
1545.82,more energy in those very neurons. 
1548.0,"And this is also why after doing a long about of exercise, "
1550.7,"you might be tired, "
1551.533,"but also if you do a about of skill learning of any kind, "
1555.75,or if you've been reading and thinking about 
1557.55,"what you're reading, "
1558.62,or if you had a intense conversation with somebody 
1561.45,"where you're really forcing yourself to listen, "
1564.0,"and hopefully they're listening to you too, "
1565.46,"and you're really trying to parse what they're saying, "
1567.12,"and maybe you're doing that right now, "
1568.39,"and you're trying to really track something, that's work, "
1571.007,"and that work requires glucose uptake by neurons, "
1573.65,both in the brain and in your body. 
1575.62,Now that we've established that glucose 
1577.11,"is the preferred source of fuel for the nervous system, "
1580.54,I'd like to concentrate on a few of the other types of 
1583.61,"sugars that we ingest on a common basis, "
1587.28,and the impact that those have 
1589.28,on brain function and body function. 
1593.55,I'd particularly like to focus on fructose. 
1595.76,"Fructose, of course, is found in fruit, "
1597.39,"it's also found in the infamous high fructose corn syrup, "
1600.45,which we will talk about today. 
1602.62,It's worth pointing out that the concentrations 
1604.41,of fructose in fruit 
1606.09,is quite low compared to the concentrations of fructose 
1608.87,in high fructose corn syrup. 
1610.39,High fructose corn syrup is approximately 
50%,"fructose, "
1615.12,which turns out to be 
1616.03,"an enormously high percentage of anything, really, "
1621.77,especially when we cut contrast that 
1623.08,to the concentrations of fructose in fruit. 
1625.61,Fruits have other types of sugars in them as well. 
1629.25,"You know, the sucrose content of most fruit "
1631.17,and fruit juices is low. 
1633.19,"Although there are some fruits like melons, peaches, "
1635.96,"pineapples, and so forth, "
1637.63,that contain a little less than 
10%,or so of sucrose. 
1642.09,Things like mangoES can have a lot of sucrose. 
1644.55,"But typically the amount of fructose, "
1646.42,"fructose, I think is the proper pronunciation, "
1649.24,people are always correcting me. 
1650.37,Fructose is anywhere from 
1%,to about 
"10%,",right? 
1658.66,It's really going to vary quite a bit. 
1660.45,And many of you have probably heard 
1661.78,"of the so-called glycemic index, "
1663.34,which is basically a measure of how fast blood sugar rises 
1666.13,"after eating particular foods, et cetera. "
1668.44,"We're going to set aside the glycemic index for now, "
1670.61,we will come back to it. 
1671.97,It has some relationship 
1673.45,to the concentrations of fructose in fruit. 
1675.83,But the point that I'd like to make 
1677.14,"is that fructose as a sugar, "
1678.73,is handled very differently in the body than is glucose. 
1683.04,But I also want to emphasize that 
1686.35,"because the percentage of fructose in fruit is rather low, "
1689.99,"especially compared to high fructose corn syrup, "
1693.23,many people have demonized fructose 
1695.8,"saying that fructose makes you fat, "
1698.5,or that fruit makes you fat. 
1700.77,"If you look at the data, that's not really the case. "
1703.6,The fact of the matter is that 
1704.62,the concentrations of fructose in fruit 
1706.28,"are so low that unless someone is consuming a lot of fruit, "
1709.46,or they're consuming a lot of fruit 
1711.32,on the backdrop of a highly processed diet 
1714.96,or a diet that has a lot of other stuff 
1716.6,"that they might not want to be ingesting, "
1718.26,you can't really say that fructose is fattening. 
1720.3,I don't really think that there's any basis for saying that 
1722.86,fructose itself is bad. 
1724.41,"Now high fructose corn syrup is a different issue, "
1727.51,"and too much consumption of anything, fructose included, "
1730.85,"whether or not it comes fruit or otherwise, "
1732.58,can be a problem for the ways that it impacts 
1735.39,"the neural circuits that process sugar, "
1738.56,"not just glucose, but fructose. "
1740.32,"And so we'll illustrate those neural circuits in a bit, "
1742.34,"and it'll become very clear to all of you, "
1744.8,regardless of whether or not 
1745.71,"you have a background in biology or metabolism, "
1748.01,"nutrition, or otherwise, "
1749.32,why ingesting very high concentrations of fructose 
1752.35,is not going to be a good thing 
1753.9,for the way that your brain functions. 
1756.69,One of the key distinctions between glucose and fructose 
1759.61,is that fructose most likely 
1761.98,cannot directly access the brain. 
1763.86,It actually needs to be converted into glucose in the liver. 
1767.58,And the way that conversion occurs 
1770.01,feeds back to a set of hormones and neural pathways 
1773.41,"that we talked about earlier, "
1774.86,which have a lot to do with appetite. 
1776.54,"And to just summarize what is now a lot of very solid data, "
1782.13,"fructose and specifically fructose, "
1784.9,has the ability to reduce certain hormones and peptides 
1788.52,in our body whose main job is to suppress Ghrelin. 
1792.91,"As you recall, Ghrelin is a hormone that increases "
1796.22,"the longer it's been since we've eaten, "
1798.23,and Ghrelin makes us hungry 
1799.78,"by stimulating particular neurons in our hypothalamus, "
1803.12,it actually makes us really want to eat. 
1805.24,"And in particular, really makes us want to eat sugary "
1808.17,and fatty foods. 
1809.62,Fructose reduces the activity of the hormones 
1812.78,that reduce Ghrelin . 
1814.6,And so the net consequence of that 
1816.34,is that fructose increases Ghrelin. 
1819.75,"So, although I and I think pretty much everyone out there, "
1824.34,"say for a few individuals, "
1826.3,agrees that calories in and calories out 
1828.37,"is the fundamental principle of weight loss, "
1830.32,weight maintenance or weight gain. 
1832.15,"Ingesting fructose shifts our hormone system, "
1836.19,"and as a consequence, our neural pathways within our brain, "
1839.9,"the hypothalamus, "
1841.27,to be hungrier regardless of how many calories we've eaten. 
1847.54,"Now I also want to be absolutely clear, "
1850.25,this does not mean that eating an apple or eating a melon 
1853.37,or eating a couple of apricots or something 
1855.69,"is going to make you hyperphagic, "
1858.97,meaning it's going to make you just want to 
1860.2,"eat, eat, and eat, that's simply not the case. "
1862.28,"But if you compare fructose and you compare glucose, "
1865.88,not only are they metabolized differently 
1867.91,"in the brain and body, but in addition to that, "
1870.93,fructose has this impact of reducing the hormones 
1874.64,that reduce hunger hormones in neural circuits. 
1877.99,And so fructose does have this kind of twist 
1880.74,"in its phenotype, right? "
1883.62,"Or I guess if fructose had a dating profile, "
1887.05,"this would be a kind of a red flag in that profile, "
1891.27,"because fructose itself, "
1893.73,"while it's actually a pretty good fuel source in many ways, "
1898.09,"and it's often packaged in things like fruits, "
1900.2,"which bring along fiber and vitamins and minerals, "
1902.5,that I think for many of us are things 
1905.04,"that we should be eating more of and ingesting more of, "
1907.32,it can suppress the pathways that suppress hunger. 
1911.05,"And as a consequence, it can increase hunger. "
1913.77,So current recommendations for most people 
1917.0,are to eat more fruits and vegetables. 
1918.78,"But for those of you that are trying to control your hunger, "
1922.23,ingesting a lot of fruit to is probably not going to be 
1925.613,a good idea. 
1926.446,"Certainly, ingesting it from high fructose corn syrup "
1928.85,is not going to be a good idea 
1929.81,because of the enormous percentages of fructose 
1932.62,"in high fructose corn syrup, "
"50%,",or sometimes even more. 
1935.73,"But even from fruit, "
1937.22,some people will find that fruit 
1938.57,really quenches their appetite. 
1939.89,Other people will find that fruit stimulates their appetite. 
1942.487,"And I suppose if you're trying to stimulate your appetite, "
1944.7,then ingesting more fruit might actually be advantageous 
1947.82,to you. 
1948.653,So fructose provides a bridge for us 
1951.38,"between a particular kind of sugar, hormone function, "
1956.71,in this case Ghrelin and the hypothalamus. 
1959.61,"which leads us to the next question, "
1961.05,which is what is it about sugar 
1963.83,that makes it such an attractive thing for us? 
1966.07,Why do we like it so much? 
1967.84,"And the obvious answer that most people arrive at is, "
1971.01,"well, it just tastes really, really good. "
1973.58,But that's actually not the way it works. 
1976.85,"The rewarding property is as we say of sugar, "
1980.74,whether or not they come in the form of sucrose or fructose 
1983.89,"or foods that increase glucose to a very high level, "
1988.71,actually is not just related to the taste of the foods 
1993.05,that produce that elevation 
1994.11,"in glucose, sucrose, or fructose. "
1996.12,"It is in part, but that's only part of the story, "
1999.35,"and the rest of the story, once you understand it, "
2002.38,can actually place you in a position to much better control 
2005.84,"your sugar intake of all kinds, "
2008.42,but also your food intake in ways that can allow you 
2010.65,to make much better choices about the foods you ingest. 
2013.4,"And actually at this point, "
2014.45,"I should probably give a confession, "
2016.77,"I've said today, and I'll say it again, "
2018.84,and I've said it I'm pretty podcast. 
2020.27,I don't have much of a sweet tooth and indeed that's true. 
2022.51,And I can kind of pass on chocolate or ice cream 
2025.46,"or things like that, "
2026.293,"it seems like with each successive year, "
2028.1,sweet things are less and less appealing to me. 
2030.84,"Of course, savory foods, anything that is really fatty, "
2036.13,"salty, savory, those don't last long in my presence, "
2039.74,"but I always say, I don't really like sweet things so much, "
2042.75,"and I like sweet people, "
2044.21,"but I don't tend to like sweet foods, which is true. "
2047.3,But there's probably one exception and that's mangoes. 
2050.48,And it turns out that mangoes 
2052.23,"have the highest percentage of sugar in them, "
2054.68,"in particular fructose, as well as other forms of sugars. "
2058.61,"So what I do, because I love mango so much, "
2062.64,"is I will have mangoes probably twice a week, "
2065.43,but I'll have them after some sort of resistance training 
2068.66,or hard run or something like that. 
2070.44,"Because it is the case that after you exercise hard, "
2073.29,in particular exercise that is 
2074.96,"of the high intensity variety, "
2077.02,that your body is more efficient at using circulating sugar. 
2081.78,It's able to store that or use that for fuel. 
2084.82,"And so what I'll typically do is just take the mango, "
2087.67,I actually eat the peels too. 
2089.02,I know there probably some people are going to cringe 
2090.5,"when they hear that, I find them delicious. "
2092.01,"So I'll just bite into those things like apples, "
2093.56,"I don't eat the pits, however. "
2095.37,So now I want to take us on a journey 
2097.37,"into the nervous system to explain, "
2099.48,the pathways in the brain and body 
2101.52,that regulate our appetite for sugar. 
2104.49,"Now, keep in mind what I already told you before, "
2107.04,"which is that when we ingest foods, "
2108.63,they're broken down into various components 
2111.46,"and glucose is going to be shuttled to the brain, "
2114.06,"and of course, to other neurons in our spinal cord "
2116.08,"and elsewhere, and to our muscles, cetera, "
2118.75,in order for all of those cells and organs and tissues 
2122.23,is to be able to function. 
2125.14,The fact that so many cells and organs and tissues 
2128.02,require glucose in order to function 
2130.45,has led to a situation where you have 
2133.42,"dedicated neural machinery, pieces of your brain, "
2136.5,"that are almost entirely, if not entirely devoted, "
2139.89,to seeking out of sugar or foods that contain sugars. 
2144.74,"And to make sure that you not only seek those out, "
2148.32,but you know where those foods are 
2150.12,and that you ingest more and more and more of them. 
2153.53,And there are two main ways that these neural circuits work. 
2155.94,"In fact, we can see that there are two neural circuits "
2157.97,entirely that work in parallel. 
2160.13,"And this is a common theme throughout the nervous system, "
2164.37,and that's parallel pathways. 
2166.15,Parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish 
2168.64,"light from dark, "
2169.78,parallel pathways are the ways that you can 
2171.32,"distinguish high pitched sounds from low pitched sounds, "
2173.65,parallel pathways are the ways 
2175.07,that you can flex your muscles versus extend your muscles. 
2178.25,"For instance, "
2179.083,"if you move your wrist closer to your shoulder, "
2180.46,"you're flexing your bicep and you're actually inhibiting, "
2183.68,you're actually preventing the action of your tricep. 
2185.37,"If you move your wrist away from your shoulder, "
2188.6,"you are essentially using your extensor, your tricep, "
2191.53,and you're inhibiting the activity of your bicep. 
2193.78,So for every function in your body 
2195.97,that you might think is controlled by one brain area 
2198.45,"or one neural circuit, "
2199.95,almost always there are two or more so called 
2202.69,parallel pathways that ensure 
2204.67,that that particular behavior happens. 
2207.96,"Now, in the case of sugar consumption, "
2211.06,the two parallel pathways involve one pathway 
2214.15,related to the actual taste and the perception of taste 
2219.05,"that lead, not just you, "
2221.31,"but every animal that we're aware of, "
2223.61,to seek more sweet containing foods. 
2228.09,The other parallel pathway 
2230.0,is related to the nutritive component of sweet foods. 
2234.84,Meaning the degree to which a given food 
2237.64,will raise blood glucose. 
2239.55,I want to repeat that. 
2240.56,One pathway in your brain and body is devoted to 
2243.9,getting you to seek out sweet tasting things 
2246.51,"that you perceive as sweet, "
2248.36,and another parallel pathway is devoted 
2251.65,to getting you to seek out foods 
2253.89,that lead to increases in blood glucose. 
2257.2,It just so happens that the foods 
2258.99,that lead to big increases in blood glucose 
2261.68,typically are associated with that sweet taste. 
2264.9,"Now, this is distinctly different "
2266.62,than the neural pathways that control seeking 
2268.98,"of savory foods or salty foods or spicy foods, "
2273.25,"for that matter, or bitter foods. "
2275.23,The sweet pathway is what we would call hardwired. 
2278.84,"It exists, as far as we know, in every mammal, "
2281.0,"it even exists in fruit flies, hence fruit fly. "
2284.07,Basically getting sweet stuff into the body 
2287.26,"might seem like it has a lot to do with the taste, "
2289.44,but it has just as much to do with the nutritive components 
2293.91,"that sweet tasting foods carry, "
2295.99,and the fact that your nervous system 
2297.89,and so many cells in your brain and body run on glucose. 
2302.22,"If you recall earlier, I said, even if you ingest fructose, "
2305.57,fructose can be converted into glucose in the liver. 
2309.83,"And I mentioned, of course, "
2310.8,"that fructose may actually work directly on the brain, "
2312.73,"that's still unclear for humans, "
2314.51,"the jury's still out on that, we will see. "
2316.92,But the fundamental thing to understand here 
2319.96,is that when you think you want a piece of chocolate 
2322.48,or you think you want a piece of cake 
2324.16,"or you're craving something sweet, "
2326.83,you are both craving the taste 
2328.65,and your neurons are literally craving 
2331.73,the nutritive components that arrive with that taste. 
2335.47,And simply by understanding that 
2337.19,can allow you to circumvent some of the sugar cravings 
2340.97,that you might otherwise be a complete hopeless victim to. 
2345.53,"Also in this episode, I will talk about ways "
2347.61,that you can sort of undermine 
2349.4,"or short circuit these circuits, if you will, "
2351.6,"in order to reduce sugar cravings on a regular basis, "
2354.68,if that's your goal. 
2356.38,"Two parallel pathways, "
2358.08,one of the parallel pathways 
2359.32,has to do with conscious perception. 
2361.11,"So animals of all kinds of mice, rats and humans, "
2364.56,will prefer sugary taste to non-sugary taste. 
2370.33,"When we eat something that tastes sweet, "
2373.25,"we register that sweet taste by way of sweet receptors, "
2377.89,literally little ports or portals of neurons 
2381.91,"on our tongue and on our pallet, "
2384.18,"a lot of people don't realize this, "
2385.18,but there are a lot of taste receptors on the soft pallet 
2388.31,"and around the mouth, on the sides of the mouth. "
2390.71,"So you're actually tasting things, "
2391.96,"not just with your tongue, but with your entire mouth "
2393.92,and your pallet. 
2394.86,"So when you ingest something sweet, "
2397.36,very quickly there are signals sent from those neurons 
2399.84,in your mouth to brain areas that cause you to seek out 
2404.31,"or at least pay attention to, "
2405.98,the source and the abundance of those sweet things. 
2408.81,They literally change your perception. 
2411.45,"In fact, there are beautiful neuroimaging studies "
2413.98,"that show that when people ingest a sugary drink, "
2418.01,their perception of images of foods change very much 
2422.26,"to make those foods appear more appetizing, "
2424.81,and not just foods that contain sugar. 
2428.35,Results of those studies do show 
2430.06,"that there's an increase for instance, "
2431.44,"in the perception of detail and images of ice cream, "
2435.44,after you ingest a sweet drink 
2436.98,"or even if you put like a hard candy into your mouth, "
2440.21,"it will make you seek out sugary things more, "
2442.26,"it will make sugary things look more appetizing, "
2444.19,"but also other foods, more appetizing. "
2446.94,"So I think it's important that people recognize that fact, "
2449.06,that when you have a sweet taste in your mouth 
2451.73,"or when you've tasted something sweet within your mouth, "
2454.91,"I should say, your perception of has immediately shifted. "
2459.75,These are fast neural pathways. 
2461.58,"We'll get into some of the brain structures in a moment, "
2463.79,but these are fast neural pathways 
2465.51,that shift your entire self toward seeking more sugary stuff 
2470.98,and more food generally. 
2472.77,"Now, does that mean that you should never ingest "
2474.83,anything sweet? 
2475.88,"No, certainly I'm not saying that, "
2478.69,everyone has to decide for themselves 
2480.08,"what the appropriate amount of sugar intake is, "
2482.15,"but I find it remarkable when people say, "
2484.93,"oh, you know, I need to get my sugar fix, "
2486.93,"or I need to have my chocolate, "
2488.7,or I need to have a little bit of something 
2489.96,to just kind of take care of that sugar appetite. 
2492.66,"Because in taking care of that sugar appetite, "
2495.29,"maybe for the very disciplined of you, "
2496.74,you can just have that one piece of chocolate 
2498.047,"and it's great, and you can relish in it, "
2500.17,but it does shift the way that you perceive 
2503.38,other foods as well. 
2504.55,"And the way it does that is through our, "
2507.46,"probably if you're listener this podcast, now old friend, "
2510.52,"but incredible neuro modulator, dopamine. "
2513.91,Dopamine is a molecule that is released from 
2516.08,several places in the brain. 
2517.79,"There's a so-called mesolimbic reward pathway, "
2520.04,"which is a whole set of places in the brain or circuits, "
2522.53,designed to get us motivated and craving 
2525.23,and in pursuit of things. 
2526.84,And then of course there are areas of the brain 
2528.64,that are involved in movement 
2529.73,that are linked up with those areas involved in motivation. 
2533.65,That makes perfect sense. 
2534.483,Why would you have a brain area involved in motivation 
2537.26,if you couldn't actually do something with that motivation? 
2539.1,So the way that your brain is designed 
2541.0,"is when there's an increase in dopamine, "
2542.94,"in the mesolimbic reward pathway, "
2544.44,there are signals sent to an area of the brain 
2546.34,"called the striatum, "
2547.19,we're going to spend a little bit of time today 
2548.57,in the striatum. 
2549.46,"It's got a dorsal part, meaning in an upper part "
2551.6,"and a ventral part, which means a lower part. "
2553.86,"And the dopamine sent to those area, "
2556.25,"places us, excuse me, into modes of action, "
2559.5,to pursue particular things. 
2563.36,"Sugar or sweet tastes, I should say, to be more specific, "
2567.02,have an incredibly potent ability 
2569.62,to activate dopamine release 
2571.44,within the mesolimbic reward pathway. 
2573.63,This has been shown over and over and over again 
2577.31,in animal models and in humans. 
2580.21,"This is especially true, I should mention, "
2583.51,through the ingestion of sweet liquids. 
2586.75,Now this becomes a very important point to us 
2588.99,a little later on when we talk about the proliferation 
2592.79,"of sodas and sweet drinks, and dare I even say, "
2597.2,"non-sugar or diet sodas, "
2599.49,we're going to get into that a little bit later. 
2600.78,They are perhaps one of the most third rail topics 
2603.52,in nutrition. 
2605.09,"But when we ingest something sweet, "
2608.54,the perception of that sweet taste 
2610.35,"increases dopamine in the mesolimbic reward pathways, "
2613.27,"which then are conveyed to pathways for motor behavior, "
2616.63,"and in general, place us into modes of focused action "
2619.7,toward getting more of whatever was sweet. 
2622.92,"Again, for those of you that are very disciplined, "
2625.06,you can probably eat that one piece of chocolate 
2627.77,and be just fine. 
2629.45,"But if you understand the way that dopamine works, "
2632.75,what you'll realize is that when this dopamine pathway 
2634.96,"is triggered, "
2636.02,it tends to create not the sensation or the perception 
2640.3,"of satiety, of feeling like something is enough, "
2643.18,but rather to produce the sensation of wanting more. 
2647.37,As described in the episode that I hosted 
2649.37,with my phenomenal colleague 
2651.45,"from Stanford School of Medicine, Dr. Anna Lembke, "
2654.09,"she's an expert on addiction and dopamine pathways, "
2657.96,the dopamine circuits of the brain 
2660.26,have what we call a pleasure pain balance. 
2663.5,"And there I'm paraphrasing what Dr. Anna Lembke has said, "
2667.68,"and has written about in her beautiful book, "
2669.497,"""Dopamine Nation."" "
2670.33,"If you haven't read that book, I highly recommend it. "
2672.39,Whether or not you have issues with addiction 
2674.74,"or you know people that do, or you don't, "
2677.17,"it's an incredibly important read, "
2679.17,especially if you're interested in understanding 
2680.82,motivated behaviors and ways to channel your behaviors 
2684.59,"in life toward healthy, motivated behaviors, "
2686.91,and make sure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls 
2689.77,"that people fall into, not just addiction, "
2691.93,but things like overuse of social media 
2695.24,"or wasting time in general, it's a phenomenal book. "
2700.16,"In that book, and of course, within research articles, "
2704.21,you will find evidence of this so-called 
2706.69,pleasure pain balance that exists 
2710.19,within our dopamine circuits. 
2711.43,Nobody has dopamine circuits that allow them 
2713.86,to escape this pleasure pain balance. 
2715.407,And the way this works is that anytime 
2717.43,that we engage in a behavior or we ingest something 
2721.06,"that increases our levels of dopamine, "
2724.4,there is a subsequent increase in the neural circuits 
2727.81,"that control our sense of frustration, pain, and lack. "
2732.79,You can actually notice this phenomenon 
2735.83,"if, for instance, "
2736.77,"you're somebody who really likes chocolate, "
2739.48,"or you really like something else, "
2741.5,pay attention to the way that you experience 
2744.51,indulging in that thing. 
2747.24,If you eat that piece of chocolate 
2749.28,"and you really focus on savoring its amazing taste, "
2752.44,you'll notice that it provides some quenching of your desire 
2757.71,"for let's say sweet stuff or chocolate or both, "
2761.58,"but right as you stop experiencing that, "
2765.24,"right as that chocolate intake tapers off, "
2768.45,"as you swallow it down your throat, "
2769.94,"or you just pause for a second afterwards, "
2772.75,what you'll notice is that your brain and body 
2775.58,actually orient toward wanting more. 
2779.02,And that wanting of more is really the action 
2782.34,of the neural circuits that underlie pain 
2784.36,and are pushing your dopamine levels back down. 
2787.92,"And when these circuits go awry or I should say, "
2790.96,when people fail to who control themselves 
2794.97,"within the context of that pleasure pain balance, "
2797.51,the typical behavior is to reach for yet another chocolate 
2800.38,or to then look for something that will quench that desire 
2804.7,and get dopamine levels back up. 
2806.44,Now the way these pleasure pain circuits work 
2809.17,is very diabolical. 
2810.47,Because it turns out that were you to take 
2811.89,"another piece of chocolate, "
2812.78,"yes, your dopamine levels would go back up, "
2814.77,but not to the same extent that they did 
2817.87,the first bite of chocolate that you had. 
2820.7,"In fact, we can say that the longer it's been "
2822.85,since you've indulged in something that you really enjoy 
2826.2,"or would like, "
2828.09,the greater the dopamine you will experience 
2830.89,when you finally engage in that behavior 
2833.54,"or indulge to that thing, ingest that thing, "
2836.21,"and the greater the dopamine increase, "
2839.03,the greater the subsequent action of those pain circuits. 
2842.45,So this puts you on a very complicated seesaw. 
2845.68,It's a very wobbly precarious state to be in. 
2848.59,"Which is not to say you shouldn't have a piece of chocolate, "
2850.43,it's just to say that the sweet taste of sweet things 
2855.33,"in particular, things that we crave very much "
2857.27,"and we wait and wait and wait, "
2858.3,and then we allow ourselves to indulge. 
2861.37,"Those trigger changes in our neurochemistry, "
2863.59,"in our neuro circuits, "
2864.51,"that place us in a very vulnerable place, "
2867.72,to either want more and more of that thing 
2870.22,or to seek out other ways to fill that kind of emptiness 
2875.33,"that we feel or that gap, "
2876.84,"like, oh, I would love more, "
2877.86,but I'm not going to allow myself more. 
2879.63,"Now again, I'm not saying that you shouldn't pursue "
2882.3,pleasurable things. 
2883.133,I mean this molecule dopamine exists for a reason. 
2886.16,"Frankly, because of its involvement in sex and reproduction, "
2889.29,it's the reason we're all here in the first place. 
2891.05,"Because last time I checked, "
2892.15,"the only way any of us got here was one way or another, "
2895.68,sperm met egg and there was conception. 
2898.14,"I still believe there are no exceptions to that, "
2900.524,"that I'm aware of anyways, "
2903.28,"that is a process, or I should say, "
2905.02,the events leading up to that process 
2906.57,typically involve dopamine in one way or another. 
2908.57,"There are exceptions to that too, but you get the idea. "
2911.18,"These dopamine pathways are not evil, they're not bad, "
2913.86,"but once you understand the way they work, "
2916.45,you can leverage them to your advantage 
2919.23,as opposed to them leveraging you to their advantage. 
2922.41,"So when you ingest something sweet, "
2925.02,you perceive that sweet taste and a cascade ensues 
2928.37,within your brain that makes you want more 
2930.51,of the sweet thing. 
2931.82,"That's the conscious pathway for sugar perception, "
2937.31,for sweet perception. 
2939.59,"Now there's the second pathway, "
2941.19,the second pathway is what's called 
2942.68,"the post-ingestive reinforcing properties of sugar, "
2946.3,which is really just a fancy nerd speak way of saying 
2949.37,there are events that happen within your stomach 
2951.89,"and below your conscious detection, "
2954.17,"that are also driving you to seek out sweet tasting things, "
2958.02,"independent of their taste, "
2960.12,"and foods that increase blood glucose, "
2963.24,independent of their taste. 
2964.93,In order to illustrate the immense power 
2966.61,"of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking, "
2969.57,I'd like to describe an experiment. 
2971.16,"And this is just one experiment of many, "
2973.46,of dozens or more experiments done in animal models 
2976.09,"and humans, which essentially illustrate the same thing. "
2978.17,"And as I describe this experiment, "
2979.81,I think you will come to understand 
2982.03,the power of these circuits. 
2983.66,I'll provide a link to this study in the caption. 
2988.04,The first author is Freeman. 
2989.87,"The paper was published in Frontiers in Bioscience, "
2991.87,"but there have been others, "
2994.0,"papers in Nature Neuroscience, papers in Neuron, "
2996.23,"Cell Press journals, et cetera, "
2997.32,"many, many journals, many, many papers. "
3000.72,If subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water 
3004.48,"or a sweet tasting fluid, "
3006.95,their preference for the sweet tasting fluid 
3009.03,"is much, much higher, right? "
3011.58,"Sweet tastes better than plain water, "
3014.08,at least for most people and certainly for animals. 
3018.57,"Now, if, for instance, "
3021.41,"you take an animal which completely lacks sweet receptors, "
3025.38,and you can do this through some molecular genetic tools 
3028.75,"and gymnastics in the laboratory, "
3030.95,"we call these knockout mice, "
3032.12,where you can knock out a particular receptor 
3033.68,"for sweet taste, "
3034.513,you can confirm that there's no perception of sweet things 
3037.37,or at least no preference for sweet things 
3039.81,in those animals. 
3040.643,"In humans, you can numb the mouth, "
3041.84,there are other pharmacologic ways 
3044.13,that you can eliminate sweet receptors in the mouth. 
3047.58,"And by doing that, you people will tell you, "
3050.02,"no, I can't taste anything sweet. "
3052.31,"You could give them a ice cream, "
3054.05,"you could give them pure sucrose, "
3055.37,"you could give them table sugar, "
3056.64,and they wouldn't be able to perceive it as sweet. 
3059.02,If you eliminate the perception of sweet taste in the mouth 
3061.32,"and you offer people or laboratory animals, "
3065.33,"water versus some sugar containing solution, "
3067.97,you eliminate the preference for the sugary solution. 
3072.44,Which tells us that the perception of sweet 
3074.52,is important for the preference for sweet tasting drink. 
3079.43,"This is also true for sweet tasting foods, I should mention. "
3083.18,"However, in both animal models and in humans, "
3087.05,after about 
15,"minutes, "
3090.71,"subjects start preferring the sugary water, "
3094.19,even though they can't taste that it is sweeter. 
3097.66,"So to repeat that, "
3099.13,"if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet, "
3101.75,"to perceive sweetness in foods, "
3104.4,then you eliminate the preference 
3105.98,for sweet beverages or sweet foods. 
3108.54,So that's not surprising. 
3109.51,But if you wait about 
15,"minutes, "
3111.48,the preference for the sweet beverage 
3114.68,or the sweet food comes back. 
3116.31,Now that doesn't mean that they can perceive the sweetness. 
3119.15,"In fact, the way these experiments are done is very clever. "
3121.96,You offer people various cups of different things 
3124.97,or different food items. 
3126.03,And then you just look at what they eat more of 
3127.68,or what they prefer to eat more of. 
3129.13,So this experiment is so crucial 
3131.71,because what it says is that the preference 
3134.48,for sugar containing foods is in part 
3137.99,"due to the sweetness of those foods, "
3140.0,but in part due to something else. 
3142.47,And this something else is what we call 
3144.05,"the post-ingestive effect, and as I mentioned before, "
3146.89,it took about 
15,minutes. 
3148.2,"And you've actually experienced this, "
3150.84,"whether you realize it or not, "
3152.26,this phenomenon of post-ingestive rewarding properties 
3155.45,"of sweet foods, "
3157.03,meaning what happens in your body 
3159.19,when you ingest something that increases 
3160.74,"your blood glucose very much, "
3162.48,"has no doubt controlled you from the inside, "
3166.61,"below your awareness, "
3168.26,this was happening to you and you didn't realize it. 
3172.22,And here's how it works. 
3173.33,We all have neurons within our gut. 
3175.9,"These neurons have a name, they're called neuropod cells. "
3178.96,Neuropod cells were famously discovered 
3181.22,"by Professor, Dr. Diego Bohorquez at Duke University. "
3186.0,"And these cells respond to, among other things, "
3189.91,to the presence of sugar within the gut. 
3192.8,"So when we ingest a sugary food or drink, "
3196.17,or we ingest a food or drink that simply contains 
3199.59,"fructose, sucrose, glucose, "
3201.27,"or some other form of sugar that later, through metabolism, "
3206.42,"will be converted into glucose, "
3209.18,the neuropod cells are able to register 
3212.0,the presence of those sweet or glucose stimulating foods. 
3217.25,"And in response to that, send electrical signals, "
3221.25,"because electrical signals are the way neurons communicate, "
3223.57,"up to the brain, via the so-called vagus nerve. "
3226.56,"The vagus nerve, of course, being a nerve pathway, "
3228.72,famous for its role in relaxation. 
3230.67,"That's kind of the assumption out there, "
3233.08,"that it's always involved in relaxation, "
3234.44,that's not the case. 
3235.35,It's involved in a lot of things besides relaxation. 
3237.83,"But nonetheless, "
3238.74,these neuropod cells send electrical signals 
3242.14,through a particular highway within the vagus 
3245.1,"to the so-called nodose ganglion, and this is a cluster, "
3247.78,a ganglion is just a cluster of neurons. 
3249.91,And then the nodose ganglion sends on information 
3252.9,to the nucleus of the solitary tract. 
3256.09,The nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain 
3258.47,that we're going to talk about extensively today. 
3260.66,It's very important for understanding sugar preference. 
3265.61,These neuropod cells also trigger activation 
3268.89,of dopamine pathways within the mesolimbic reward pathway. 
3273.32,"In other words, there are signals conveyed from the gut, "
3276.91,"meaning stomach and intestines, to the brain "
3279.8,"anytime we ingest sweet foods, "
3282.73,but it has nothing to do with our perception 
3285.24,"of them being sweet, it has everything to do with the fact "
3287.67,that sweetness of food is almost always correlated 
3290.73,with an ability to increase blood glucose. 
3294.24,And the net effect of this is a parallel pathway 
3298.16,by which dopamine is increased further. 
3301.24,"Now, the experiment that I described before "
3304.34,of animals or humans ingesting something 
3307.54,"that contains sugar, "
3308.71,"but not being able to perceive its sweetness, "
3310.93,"and yet, after a period of time, "
3314.1,still preferring that food or drink 
3316.6,"to non-sugar containing food or drinks, "
3319.32,"even though they can't distinguish their taste, "
3321.77,is dependent on these neuropod cells and related pathways. 
3326.6,What this may for you is that anytime 
3328.98,"you eat something sweet, "
3331.73,"that substance is actually causing your gut, "
3335.08,"your stomach and your intestine, or to be more precise, "
3338.48,"I should say, that substance, food substance, "
3341.44,is causing the neuropod cells in your stomach and intestines 
3345.22,"to send a parallel set of signals up to your brain saying, "
3348.89,"eat more of that, or simply eat more, eat more, eat more, "
3352.34,and preferably eat more sweet foods. 
3354.57,"So we've all heard of hidden sugars, "
3356.86,meaning the sugars that manufacturers have put into foods 
3359.71,and disguised them with other flavors. 
3361.62,"I talked about this in the episode on salt, "
3363.7,using salt to mask the taste of sweetness 
3366.06,so that people ingest more sugar. 
3368.28,That is not an accident 
3369.84,that hidden sugars are often hidden with salt 
3372.64,or with other flavors. 
3374.55,"It's done so that people will, meaning you or me, "
3377.97,"will want to ingest more of a particular food, "
3381.93,independent of how sweet that food tastes. 
3384.8,"And in fact, some crackers, for instance, "
3387.08,"chips for instance, you might think, oh, well, you know, "
3389.65,"chips, they're not sweet, they're salty and savory. "
3392.76,"And again, I'll mention, I love salty and savory foods, "
3396.12,"including certain foods, I love kettle chips, for instance, "
3398.5,I try not to walk by them in the grocery store. 
3401.33,"I usually have to eat one bag while I'm in the store, "
3403.23,and then another later. 
3404.59,The savory foods are often laden with these hidden sugars 
3410.01,"that we can't register as sweetness, "
3411.95,"but trigger the neuropod cells, "
3413.4,"which then further trigger dopamine, "
3414.85,which make us want more of them. 
3416.69,"Now we may be able to resist eating more of them, "
3419.35,but it makes us crave more food in general. 
3423.61,"Now we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway, "
3427.37,to sort of intervene in this subconscious pathway. 
3430.75,But for now I'm hoping that just the understanding 
3434.52,"that we all have this pathway, "
3435.83,"this is hardwired into our body, "
3439.63,could potentially allow people to better understand 
3441.88,"why is it that their cravings are so intense, "
3445.46,that it's not necessarily just about the taste of that food. 
3448.48,And when you consider this in concert with the fact 
3453.09,"that we have this dopamine pain pleasure balance, excuse me, "
3456.53,"that I referred to earlier, "
3458.22,you start to realize that there are multiple mechanisms 
3460.45,"hardwired into us, that make it especially hard to not eat "
3464.59,the sweet thing or to not eat the food that we're craving. 
3467.47,"And indeed, that's the case. "
3468.81,We have two major accelerators. 
3470.72,"It's like a car with two accelerators, "
3472.99,"and we will talk about the brakes, "
3474.83,but two ways that really get us into forward motion 
3478.06,toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods. 
3481.13,"Now, if it doesn't already seem diabolical enough, "
3483.33,"that sweet things that we perceive as sweet, "
3485.93,make us want to eat more of those 
3487.04,because of dopamine and then send us down 
3488.91,"this pain pleasure pathway that I mentioned earlier, "
3493.03,and the fact that we have this subconscious circuit 
3496.0,coming from the neuropod cells in our gut 
3498.14,that are registering the presence of sugar 
3500.71,or glucose increasing foods in our gut 
3502.73,and sending those signals to the brain for yet more dopamine 
3504.917,"and pain pleasure challenges, "
3507.69,there's a third layer to this whole thing. 
3510.11,And that has to do with how sugar 
3512.24,is metabolized in the brain. 
3513.71,Or I should say how glucose is used. 
3515.83,"Without getting into too much detail, "
3518.3,some of the more beautiful studies of neuroimaging 
3521.67,and evaluating which brain areas are active 
3525.09,when we eat certain foods 
3526.34,"were done by Dr. Dana Small's lab at Yale University, "
3529.83,"and in some of her previous work when she was elsewhere, "
3533.14,and of course by other laboratories too. 
3535.17,And they used an approach called 
3536.72,"positron emission tomography, "
3538.67,"and they and others have used PET scanning as it's called, "
3542.96,"positron mission tomography, "
3545.54,along with an tool called 
2-Deoxy-D-glucose.,
3548.48,
2-Deoxy-D-glucose,is actually involved in the procedure 
3551.52,of seeing which brain areas are active 
3553.49,when people eat foods or engage in other types of behaviors. 
3556.52,But the way that 
"2-Deoxy-D-glucose,",
3559.33,sometimes shortened 
2DG.,
3561.33,The way that it works is to block glucose uptake 
3565.55,from neurons. 
3566.93,"And instead, bring along with it, "
3569.7,a marker that one can see through imaging. 
3572.43,"So in other words, "
3573.78,a tool for looking at what parts of the brain are active 
3577.2,"when eating particular foods, "
3579.12,"actually prevents foods such as sugar, "
3582.6,from allowing glucose to get into particular neurons. 
3586.95,"Now that might seem like a bad situation, "
3589.01,"you'd say, well, wait, "
3589.843,"you're trying to understand how sugar works in the brain, "
3592.53,"and then you block the ability for sugar, glucose, "
3596.44,"to bind to, or be used by these neurons, "
3599.75,because of the thing that you're using for the experiment. 
3601.54,"Exactly, it's a huge problem, "
3603.41,but it turns out to be a huge problem 
3604.67,that led to a great insight. 
3606.11,"And the great insight is this, "
3608.5,the preference for sweet tasting foods and liquids 
3611.97,is actually blocked by 
2-Deoxy-D-glucose.,
3617.52,"What that means, experimentally, "
3619.28,but also in terms of what it means for you and me 
3621.55,"in the real world, is that there's yet "
3623.89,a third parallel pathway 
3626.98,"that's related to the use of blood sugar, "
3630.99,"the use of glucose by neurons, "
3634.1,that further reinforces our desire to eat more sweet things. 
3638.81,And the preference for sweet foods 
3640.9,can actually be eliminated through 
2-Deoxy-D-glucose.,
3645.43,Now I am definitely don't want people going out 
3648.42,and consuming 
2-Deoxy-D-glucose.,
3649.84,"This is a laboratory tool, "
3651.07,it is not something that you should be ingesting. 
3654.05,"So don't go look it up and try and get some, "
3656.15,"there might be other uses for it, but that's not the point. "
3658.19,The point is that it is the sweet taste of sugary foods. 
3663.21,"It is the signals coming from your gut, "
3666.87,"from your digestive tract to your brain, "
3669.47,and it's the use of the metabolic consequences 
3673.89,of sugary foods that are acting as a three pronged push 
3678.62,on your desire to consume more sugary foods. 
3681.84,"So this car analogy that I used before, "
3684.78,"where it's some weird car that has two accelerators, "
3687.06,it actually has three accelerators. 
3689.38,"And so with three accelerators, all pushing the system hard, "
3693.75,"we can say, wow, "
3694.82,there must be something really special about this pathway. 
3697.57,"And indeed there is, "
3698.7,this pathway is the quickest source of fuel for the brain 
3701.7,"and the rest of the nervous system, "
3702.75,it's the source of fuel for the brain and nervous system. 
3705.95,"And I realize, as I say that all the ketonistas "
3708.63,"are probably going no, "
3709.54,actually ketones are the preferred source. 
3711.37,"Okay, i acknowledge that there are conditions "
3713.95,"under which you can bring your blood glucose very low, "
3716.13,and there are reasons to do that. 
3717.32,Actually ketosis has been a 
3719.41,terrifically successful treatment 
3721.28,"for a lot of forms of epilepsy, "
3722.72,"in particular, pediatric epilepsy. "
3726.19,"Many people do derive benefit from ketogenic diets, "
3728.56,"so I'm not knocking ketogenic diets, "
3730.69,"but if you were to look at what neurons normally prefer, "
3734.54,"meaning in a typical diet regimen, it would be glucose. "
3739.95,And the fact that fructose 
3742.26,"is eventually converted to glucose, "
3743.97,"the fact that when we ingest sucrose, "
3745.74,"it's eventually converted into a fuel that neurons can use, "
3747.88,"that's very much in the glucose pathway, "
3750.07,what you basically arrive at is the fact 
3752.0,that your nervous system is a glucose consuming machine. 
3755.0,"And you've got at least three pathways, "
3757.12,"of which I've described, "
3758.57,that are pushing on your brain consciously 
3761.15,and subconsciously to get you to seek and consume 
3764.06,more sugar. 
3765.19,"Now that all sounds like a pretty depressing picture, "
3768.08,at least for those of you that are trying to reduce 
3769.56,your sugar intake. 
3770.393,And of course we can all reduce sugar intake 
3773.11,"by way of sheer will, "
3774.43,"we can not have those foods at home, "
3776.48,we can restrict ourselves from those. 
3778.4,But there are some things that we all can 
3781.33,and perhaps should do in order to regulate these pathways 
3785.02,"such that we don't feel so controlled by them, "
3788.41,but rather that we control their output. 
3791.36,"And of course they are us and we are them, "
3792.96,so this gets into all sorts of issues of consciousness 
3795.61,and freewill that I certainly don't want to cover 
3797.59,in this episode. 
3798.9,"But nonetheless, I think once you understand "
3802.77,that these circuits exist 
3804.61,and you understand that there are simple substitutions 
3808.13,and modifications that one can make to their food intake 
3811.57,that can work within these pathways 
3814.82,"and even bypass some of these pathways, "
3817.17,you start to realize that you have a lot more control 
3819.42,over sugar intake and sugar appetite 
3822.503,than you previously thought. 
3824.16,"Now, many of you have heard of the so-called glycemic index. "
3826.57,The glycemic index is a measure of 
3828.44,how quickly blood sugar rises 
3830.0,after ingesting particular foods. 
3831.97,"And very broadly speaking, "
3833.98,"we can say that there are low glycemic index foods, "
3836.98,of less than 
"55,","typically, is the measurement, "
3840.08,"or medium glycemic index foods, "
3841.94,which go from about 
55,to 
"69,",
3844.02,"and then so called high glycemic foods, which are above "
70.,
3846.89,And of course there's additional nuance 
3848.92,related to glycemic load 
3850.93,and many more features of the glycemic index. 
3854.98,A couple of things to understand 
3856.22,about how the glycemic index is measured. 
3858.77,And then I'd like to just briefly talk about 
3861.05,how the glycemic index can be leveraged to short circuit 
3865.55,some of the neural circuits that would otherwise lead us 
3868.73,to crave and perhaps even ingest sugar foods. 
3873.12,"First of all, measurements of glycemic indices of food "
3877.76,are typically made by having people ingest those foods 
3880.51,in isolation. 
3881.8,"And in general, we can say that anytime we ingest fiber "
3886.45,"and/or fat, lipids, along with a particular food, "
3889.87,"it will reduce the glycemic index of that particular food, "
3893.87,either the absolute level of blood glucose 
3897.39,that a particular food causes 
3900.16,or the rate at which that elevation in blood glucose occurs. 
3905.09,And this is why there are some seemingly paradoxical aspects 
3909.28,to sweet stuff in terms of the glycemic index. 
3911.45,"For instance, Ice cream has a lower glycemic index, "
3914.52,"provided its ice cream that includes fat, "
3916.48,"which I hope it would, "
3917.313,"'cause that's the good tasting ice cream, "
3918.38,"in my opinion, "
3919.43,"compared to something like mangoes or table sugar, right? "
3923.15,"So the glycemic index is not something to hold holy, "
3927.21,"in most cases, "
3928.1,because most people are not ingesting foods in isolation. 
3931.04,And there's actually a lot of argument 
3932.52,as to whether or not the glycemic index 
3933.96,is really as vital as some people claim. 
3938.21,There's also the context 
3939.41,in which you ingest particular foods. 
3941.22,"As I mentioned earlier, "
3942.68,"after I do hard training of any kind, "
3945.08,"meaning training that ought to deplete glycogen, "
3946.9,"so hard resistance training, "
3948.09,I actually make it a point to ingest 
3950.16,"some very sweet high glycemic foods like a mango, "
3953.3,I'll also ingest some starches 
3954.73,'cause I'm trying to replenish glycogen. 
3956.12,I'm also trying to spike my blood sugar a little bit 
3958.79,because that can be advantageous 
3960.07,"in terms of certain strength and hypertrophy protocols, "
3962.45,et cetera. 
3963.283,But most of the time I'm avoiding these high glycemic foods 
3965.247,"and high sugar foods, I should point that out. "
3967.59,"Now, why am I telling you about the glycemic index? "
3969.71,"Well, if we zoom out and take our perspective "
3973.31,"on all of this discussion about the glycemic index, "
3975.68,"through the lens of the nervous system, "
3978.09,and we remind ourselves that neurons 
3980.38,"prefer glucose for energy and that all sweet things, "
3984.24,"or things that we perceive as sweet, "
3985.65,but also sweet things that are ingested and registered 
3988.47,by those neuropod cells in our gut 
3990.54,trigger the release of dopamine 
3992.45,and trigger these neural circuits 
3994.39,"to make us want to eat more of these foods, "
3997.01,what we start to realize is that a sharp rise 
4000.04,in blood glucose or a very high degree of elevation 
4003.86,"in blood glucose, "
4004.98,is going to be a much more potent signal 
4007.9,than would a more moderate rise in blood glucose 
4011.63,or a slower rise in blood glucose. 
4014.89,"So if we think about the analogy of three accelerators, "
4018.23,"meaning three parallel neural circuits, "
4020.13,all essentially there to get us to seek out 
4023.27,"and consume more sweet tasting and sugary foods, "
4027.26,well then the glycemic index is sort of our measurement 
4031.01,of how hard we are pushing down 
4032.95,or how fast we are pushing down on those three accelerators. 
4036.5,And so for those of you that are trying to 
4038.2,"reduce sugar take, "
4039.55,and you want to do that through an understanding 
4042.04,"of how these neural circuits work, "
4043.56,and you want to short circuit some of the dopamine release 
4046.62,that's caused by ingesting sugary foods. 
4050.13,"It can be advantageous to ingest sweet foods, "
4055.35,either alone or in combination with foods 
4058.96,that reduce glycemic index or reduce glycemic load. 
4062.9,So that might mean making different food choices. 
4066.02,So paying attention to sweet tasting foods 
4068.81,"that can satisfy sugar cravings, "
4070.84,"but do not have as steep or I should say, "
4073.51,"do not cause as steep a rise in blood sugar, "
4076.04,or it could mean consuming other foods 
4079.26,along with sweet foods 
4080.88,in order to reduce the glycemic index 
4083.24,"and thereby, slow or blunt the release of dopamine. "
4087.36,"You might think, well, why would I want to do that? "
4089.31,I want the maximum dopamine output 
4091.68,in response to a given sweet food. 
4093.31,"I don't just want the you know, level "
10.,
4095.47,I want the level 
100,output of dopamine. 
4098.08,"But you really don't, "
4099.13,because of the pleasure pain balance that dopamine causes. 
4101.69,"And in fact, if we consider some of the non-food substances "
4104.98,"that really push hard on these dopamine pathways, "
4107.31,"we can come up with a somewhat sinister, "
4109.88,but nonetheless appropriate analogy. 
4113.25,"The drug, cocaine, causes very robust, potent increases "
4117.57,"in dopamine within the brain, "
4119.53,and typically causes people to want to ingest more cocaine 
4122.89,because of those sharp increases in dopamine. 
4127.28,"But within the category of the drug cocaine, "
4130.14,there are various modes of ingestion. 
4132.12,"Some people inhale it, "
4133.73,"some people will inject it intravenously, "
4137.52,"some people will smoke it, "
4138.91,and those different forms of taking cocaine 
4142.13,actually impact the dopamine circuits differently. 
4144.95,"And it turns out that crack cocaine, "
4147.67,"the smokable form of cocaine rock, "
4151.27,"increases dopamine to a very high degree, "
4153.93,but also very quickly. 
4156.26,"And it is the sharp rise in dopamine over time, "
4160.56,"not so much the absolute level of dopamine, "
4163.4,that makes crack cocaine so absolutely addictive. 
4167.45,"So sometimes you'll hear, you know, "
4168.9,"sugar is like crack, "
4170.4,"well, and that's getting a little extreme "
4172.14,because even though I don't think the measurements 
4174.05,"have been done in the same experiment, "
4176.1,I think it's reasonable to think 
4177.66,that the absolute level of dopamine caused 
4180.85,"by ingesting sugar, at least for most people, "
4182.85,is not going to be as high as the absolute level of dopamine 
4186.09,caused by smoking crack. 
4188.39,"Of course it goes without saying, "
4189.5,"please don't do cocaine in any form, by the way. "
4193.7,It is appropriate to say that the rate of dopamine increase 
4198.87,"over time has a profound effect on how people will, "
4203.95,"and if people will, "
4205.75,go on to want to pursue more of what caused 
4208.46,that increase in dopamine. 
4210.16,So what I'm basically saying is if you're going to ingest 
4213.15,"sweet foods in order to satisfy a sweet craving, "
4218.4,ingesting sweet foods for which the glycemic index is lower 
4222.33,or in which you've adjusted those glycemic index foods 
4226.06,"through the co-ingestion of fiber, or maybe fat, "
4230.09,might be beneficial. 
4231.61,So is this justification for putting peanut butter 
4234.51,on that piece of chocolate 
4235.88,or for having a of ice cream along with the mango 
4239.8,that you're craving? 
4241.2,"In some sense, yes, however, "
4244.23,there's also the issue of how sweet and how delicious 
4247.21,something tastes. 
4248.32,"Highly palatable foods, absolutely delicious foods, "
4251.73,"trigger that one neural circuit, "
4253.91,that one accelerator that we were talking about 
4256.41,"in terms of our analogy of three accelerators, "
4258.95,"and the more delicious something tastes within our mouth, "
4261.85,the further increase in dopamine. 
4264.66,So if you really wanted to adjust your sugar cravings 
4267.9,"and you really still want to ingest some sugary foods, "
4272.62,you probably would better off combining fiber 
4275.55,with that sugary or sweet food. 
4277.99,Now I do realize that it's somewhat unusual 
4279.94,"and you probably get some strange stares, "
4282.28,"if you decided to consume broccoli, "
4284.54,"for instance, along with your chocolate, "
4286.36,or with a another dessert that would otherwise 
4288.45,cause a steep increase in blood sugar 
4291.0,and has a high glycemic index. 
4292.69,"But nonetheless, if your goal is to blunt "
4295.92,"your sugar cravings, "
4297.33,what you really need to do is blunt that dopamine increase. 
4300.35,So what we're really talking about here 
4302.29,is trying to reduce the dopamine signal 
4305.14,that is the consequence of ingesting sweet foods. 
4307.75,And we're talking about doing that 
4309.08,"through these different parallel pathways, "
4310.86,"not just by preventing sweet taste, "
4312.96,but also by preventing the post-ingestive effects 
4315.79,of sweet foods. 
4317.76,And of course the backdrop to all of this 
4320.66,"is that most of us, again, most of us, not all of us, "
4323.3,should probably be ingesting fewer refined sugars. 
4327.66,Certainly there are exceptions to that. 
4329.65,But I think the bulk of data point to the fact 
4333.07,"that ingesting these highly palatable, "
4335.58,"certainly highly palatable, highly processed foods, "
4337.89,"or foods that contain a lot of high fructose corn syrup, "
4341.35,"can be really deleterious to our health, "
4343.05,especially in kids. 
4344.79,"And I'm not going to cite off a bunch of statistics, "
4347.61,"you've all heard them before, "
4348.64,"that you know, for hundreds of years, we ingested, you know, "
4352.84,the equivalent of a few cups or pounds of sugar per year. 
4356.32,"And you know, now people are ingesting "
4357.98,hundreds of pounds of sugar per year. 
4360.34,"The major culprit always seems to be sugary drinks, "
4363.72,"meaning soft drinks, and I think indeed that's the case. "
4367.64,I do want to point out the incredible work 
4369.68,"of Dr. Robert Lustig, "
4370.91,who's a pediatric endocrinologist 
4372.84,"at the University of California San Francisco, "
4374.9,who was really early in the game of voicing the dangers 
4377.895,"of so-called hidden sugars and highly processed foods, "
4380.55,"there are other people, of course, now talking about this. "
4383.7,"His laboratory has done important work showing for instance, "
4387.21,that if high fructose corn syrup 
4390.14,"or even just fructose is replaced with glucose, "
4393.14,"even if the same number calories is ingested, "
4396.69,that there are important meaning significant reductions 
4400.91,"in type two diabetes, "
4403.37,some of the metabolic syndromes 
4404.66,associated with high fructose corn syrup 
4406.347,and on and on and on. 
4408.02,"And of course there are other culprits in type two diabetes, "
4410.68,there are other factors that are going to lead to obesity. 
4413.9,But I think that work from Lustig and others 
4416.44,has really illustrated that we should all be trying 
4419.21,to reduce our intake of highly refined sugars 
4422.43,and high fructose corn syrup. 
4424.28,And certainly trying to reduce our intake 
4426.66,"of very sugary drinks, not just soft drinks, "
4431.28,but also fruit juices that contain a lot of sugar. 
4433.95,"Now, even for people that are of healthy weight "
4436.09,"and who don't have metabolic syndromes, "
4438.36,there may be an additional reason 
4440.2,to not want to ingest very sweet foods 
4443.67,and highly refined sugars. 
4445.2,And this has to do with a new and emerging area 
4448.22,of nutrition neuroscience. 
4451.95,"And I want to point out that these are new data, right, "
4454.7,"so it's not a lock, "
4455.67,the double blind placebo controlled studies 
4457.61,in large populations have not been finished. 
4460.32,"So I want to make sure that that's clear, "
4463.42,but I also want to make clear 
4465.37,"what some of the really exciting data, "
4467.38,"coming from Dana Small's lab at Yale, "
4469.75,and from other laboratories are showing. 
4472.03,And this has to do with what's called 
4473.92,conditioned taste preference. 
4476.07,"Using a kind of Pavlovian paradigm, what they do, "
4479.67,"is they have people, and these studies were done in people, "
4482.79,"ingest maltodextrin, which increases blood glucose, "
4485.96,"doesn't have much flavor, "
4487.0,"but even if it does have a little bit of subtle flavor, "
4489.8,the maltodextrin is cloaked by some other flavor. 
4493.67,And by cloaking it with that other flavor 
4496.33,"or pairing it with that other flavor, "
4497.95,"what they find is that over time, "
4499.88,"because the maltodextrin increases blood glucose, "
4502.36,and they're ingesting a particular flavor 
4504.06,"along with that maltodextrin, "
4506.05,"they can then remove the maltodextrin, "
4509.3,and the flavor will induce an increase in insulin. 
4513.85,"The increase in insulin of course, "
4515.35,is the consequence of the fact that anytime 
4517.59,"there's a rise in blood glucose, "
4518.78,"provided the person isn't diabetic, "
4520.42,there's a parallel increase in insulin. 
4525.26,"Now this is very interesting because what it says is, "
4528.47,"well at a first pass, it says that we are very Pavlovian "
4531.62,in terms of our physiological responses to foods 
4534.9,and particular flavors come to be associated 
4537.66,with particular patterns of blood glucose increase 
4541.27,"and hence patterns of insulin increase, "
4544.294,"because of course, "
4545.127,insulin manages glucose in the bloodstream 
4547.29,as I mentioned earlier. 
4549.52,This also has implications for understanding 
4552.44,things like artificial sweeteners. 
4553.9,And here I want to highlight that this is still 
4555.83,"very controversial work, needs more data, but nonetheless, "
4558.93,I'd like to share it with you for consideration. 
4563.08,"The small laboratory has done studies in humans, "
4566.66,"both in adults and in children, "
4568.66,showing that if the flavor of artificial sweeteners 
4573.07,"is paired with maltodextrin, "
4574.85,"and then the maltodextrin is removed, "
4577.45,that the artificial sweetener taste itself 
4580.92,can subsequently increase insulin in the bloodstream. 
4584.47,"In other words, taking something that increases blood sugar, "
4589.03,"attaching a flavor experience to that, "
4591.9,"having children or adults ingest that thing, "
4596.15,allows the nervous system to associate that flavor 
4599.72,with that increase in blood glucose. 
4601.57,"But then you can remove the glucose increasing substance, "
4605.2,and the flavor alone will increase insulin 
4607.63,because insulin typically follows blood glucose. 
4610.21,So this is a conditioning effect. 
4612.05,"Now, the reason these data are controversial "
4614.01,is several fold. 
4614.843,"First of all, the landscape around the discussion "
4619.15,around artificial sweeteners is definitely what I would call 
4623.16,a barbed wire topic. 
4624.69,"And I want to preface what I'm about to say next by saying, "
4627.05,I actually ingest artificial sweeteners. 
4629.26,"I will have the occasional diet soda, not every day, "
4632.32,"maybe I don't know, once or twice a month. "
4634.0,"I don't particularly like the taste, "
4635.11,"but I'll do it just 'cause it's around, "
4636.54,and I want some caffeine and I like the carbonation 
4638.92,"if I'm on a plane or something, "
4640.6,I do ingest plant-based non-caloric sweeteners. 
4644.52,"To my knowledge, there have not been high quality studies "
4647.5,of plant-based non-caloric sweeteners 
4649.54,in the context that I'm referring to here. 
4652.49,"Nonetheless, these studies show that particular flavors "
4655.5,can be conditioned to cause an insulin increase. 
4658.84,And the flavor associated with certain artificial sweeteners 
4663.81,is included in that category of flavors 
4666.2,"that can induce insulin, "
4667.76,even in the absence of something 
4669.133,that can increase blood glucose. 
4670.69,Now the simple takeaway from these studies 
4674.298,"would be the following, "
4676.59,and this is actually one interpretation that Dana Small 
4679.81,"has offered to her data, "
4680.92,but she offers other interpretations as well. 
4682.96,One of interpretation is that if people 
4685.8,"are going to ingest artificial sweeteners, "
4688.49,and they do that along with foods 
4690.72,"that very sharply increase blood glucose, "
4694.13,"then there is the potential, I highlight the potential, "
4697.77,"for those same artificial sweeteners to increase insulin, "
4701.94,even in the absence of food. 
4704.76,"In other words, let's just draw the scenario out "
4706.63,in the real world. 
4708.87,You're having a diet soda 
4711.81,along with a cheeseburger and fries. 
4715.26,"You do that every day for lunch, okay? "
4717.92,"Somewhat extreme example, but natural world example, "
4719.97,you do that every day for lunch. 
4721.09,And then you just have a diet soda alone. 
4724.57,The extreme interpretation of the data 
4727.7,"that they've collected says, "
4729.12,"well, that diet soda alone will increase insulin, "
4731.46,even though there's no increase in blood glucose 
4733.89,because you haven't ingested food with it 
4735.07,because you conditioned that taste of artificial sweetener 
4738.62,to the experience of a rise in glucose and hence insulin. 
4742.24,"Now the counter argument to this would be, "
4744.82,"well, that's a very unusual situation, "
4746.84,"maltodextrin causes big increases in blood glucose, "
4750.09,so that's not really a fair experiment 
4752.77,or it's not a natural world experiment. 
4754.34,And I think that's a decent assessment. 
4756.32,Although I will point out that one of the reasons 
4759.32,why this study is so controversial 
4761.81,"or why these data are so controversial, "
4763.45,is that the experiment actually had to be stopped. 
4766.24,And particularly the experiment in children 
4767.84,had to be stopped because the changes in insulin 
4772.31,"that were observed early in the study were so detrimental, "
4776.53,"that the institutional review board, quite appropriately, "
4779.77,"said, we can't do this to these kids. "
4781.35,They're experiencing these odd shifts in insulin 
4784.64,that are not healthy for them 
4786.76,when they're just ingesting artificial sweeteners 
4788.81,in the absence of these glucose increasing foods. 
4791.86,"So once again, I do ingest artificial sweeteners, "
4795.08,"I'm not saying that they are dangerous, "
4796.31,"I'm not saying that they are not dangerous, "
4798.65,I'm saying that you have to decide for yourself. 
4800.95,"In previous episodes, "
4801.86,I've highlighted that artificial sweeteners 
4803.9,"have been shown in studies of animals, "
4807.53,"that when given in very high doses, sucralose in particular, "
4811.93,"there can be fairly robust disruption to the gut microbiome, "
4816.46,"which is vital for immune health and brain health, "
4818.56,"et cetera, et cetera. "
4820.17,"But thus far, our knowledge of how artificial sweeteners "
4824.07,"negatively impacts or positively impacts, I should say, "
4826.81,"the microbiome and other deleterious effects on the body, "
4832.58,has mainly been explored in animal studies. 
4836.13,"Again, the work by Dana Small has been done in humans. "
4839.41,There's some parallel work by others in animal models. 
4842.04,I bring it up today to illustrate the following point. 
4847.56,Normally we have a pathway 
4849.27,"that we don't have to condition at all, "
4851.01,"it's there from birth, "
4852.64,whereby ingestion of sweet foods 
4855.14,causes increases in dopamine. 
4857.66,And there are parallel pathways by which neurons in our gut 
4862.02,"and elsewhere in our body, "
4863.56,trigger further increases in dopamine. 
4867.56,There's no need for a conditioned response 
4870.27,"or to become Pavlovian about this, right? "
4872.64,"You're hardwired to want to eat sweet things, "
4875.59,by at least two and probably three parallel pathways. 
4878.61,Now the work from Dana Small's lab and others 
4881.63,"that have illustrated this conditioned flavor preference, "
4884.91,I think beautifully show that any flavor 
4888.01,that's associated with a glucose spike 
4890.69,or a long sustained increase in glucose 
4894.37,can also be conditioned. 
4895.92,"In other words, the circuits for dopamine "
4898.07,that reinforce the desire to eat particular things 
4900.57,is not unique to the sugar pathway. 
4902.43,"And this is one of the reasons I believe, "
4905.48,why ingestion of sweet foods 
4907.87,"doesn't just us to want to eat more sweet foods, "
4910.61,I think that is absolutely clear 
4912.23,"based on animal data and on human data, "
4914.333,"I think that's robust, "
4915.55,"it's actually the stuff of textbooks now, "
4919.09,"but in addition, ingesting sweet foods "
4921.09,"and/or foods that raise blood glucose, "
4923.98,but that we don't perceive as sweet. 
4925.81,"So for instance, foods with hidden sugars, "
4928.32,"sugars that have been masked asked by salty or spicy taste, "
4932.17,increases our desire for glucose elevating foods 
4935.037,"and food, generally, "
4936.95,I think that's the only logical interpretation 
4939.61,of the data that I can arrive at. 
4941.63,So for people that struggle with regulating their appetite 
4943.84,"or with regulating their sugar appetite, "
4946.25,"I think the understanding of conditioned flavor preference, "
4949.15,"while a little bit complicated, "
4951.21,ought to be useful in trying to navigate reducing 
4954.06,sugar cravings and sugar intake. 
4955.82,"As a segue into tools to control sugar intake, "
4958.41,"as a means to both regulate sugar intake itself, "
4962.57,as well as food intake overall 
4964.41,and steer us towards healthier choices. 
4967.26,I'd like to talk about some of the special populations 
4970.45,out there that might want to be especially wary 
4972.9,of having a dysregulated sugar appetite system. 
4977.73,And the group I'm referring to specifically 
4980.06,are those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
4983.23,"or, I should say, and/or, "
4985.54,"people who have issues with focus and attention, generally. "
4988.99,"And I think more and more nowadays, "
4990.3,I'm hearing that people are having a hard time focusing. 
4993.07,This probably has something to do with our interactions 
4996.01,with electronic devices. 
4997.27,"As I always say, if a picture is worth a thousand words, "
4999.64,"a movie is worth a million pictures, "
5002.56,and the fact that we can access so any movies 
5005.53,"just by scrolling with our thumb, "
5007.16,is something that the nervous system 
5008.26,has just never contended with before in human history. 
5010.82,I'm confident in that. 
5012.35,"And it's not that it can't deal with it, "
5014.29,the question is what's the trade off? 
5016.36,What are the consequences of that? 
5018.66,So attention and ability to focus is obviously key 
5022.66,"to success in school, success in relationships, "
5025.13,"success in the workplace, and success in life. "
5028.38,We could probably even go so far as to say one's ability 
5031.35,to succeed in anything is proportional to one's ability 
5034.94,to focus and then deliberately defocus 
5037.32,"when the time comes to defocus, right? "
5038.98,'Cause we all need rest and we need to disengage 
5040.84,"and then reengage, "
5043.64,If you look at the sum total of the meta-analysis 
5047.92,"and the clinical data on ADHD and nutrition, "
5052.13,"you arrive at a pretty clear answer, "
5054.19,"which is that sugar consumption, "
5056.21,"in particular, highly refined sugars, "
5058.07,is just not good for people with ADHD 
5061.15,or with attentional issues. 
5062.82,"Now, as I say that, I also want you to recall "
5065.46,"the earlier study that I referred to, "
5067.17,whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain 
5069.46,is highly dependent on glucose. 
5071.02,So this doesn't mean consuming no glucose 
5074.11,is going to be a good idea. 
5075.15,It doesn't mean that the ketogenic diet 
5077.6,is necessarily the best diet for ADHD. 
5080.38,Although there are some people pursuing that 
5082.55,"and exploring that, and we'll do yet another episode on ADHD "
5085.81,"at some point that go was a little bit deeper into that, "
5087.92,because there's some new data. 
5088.91,I did do a very long and fairly extensive episode on ADHD. 
5094.47,"You're welcome to look that up if you like in our archive, "
5097.88,"excuse me, in our archive at hubermanlab.com, "
5102.58,it's all timestamped. 
5103.54,"So, you know, because the number of people said, "
5105.75,"oh, you know, it's an episode on ADHD "
5107.267,and you made it two and a half hours long. 
5108.72,"Yes we did, because we wanted it to be as comprehensive "
5111.68,as we could at the time. 
5113.07,"But it is timestamped, "
5114.26,you can just jump to the particular topics of interest 
5115.52,and there's short little cassettes there. 
5118.53,"Now, if you'd like to know upon what I'm basing "
5121.26,this statement that sugar consumption 
5123.93,and highly refined sugar consumption 
5125.83,"is potentially bad for ADHD, "
5128.14,I'm basing this mainly on the conclusions 
5131.56,"of a really nice paper, "
5133.04,the title of the paper is 
5134.477,"""Sugar Consumption, Sugar Sweetened Beverages, "
5137.32,and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: 
5139.36,"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."" "
5141.27,"And this is a paper, "
5143.5,we'll put a link to this in the caption. 
5145.64,This was published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine 
5148.77,which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense. 
5151.04,But I really like this meta-analysis. 
5153.43,"The sum total of this meta-analysis is really that when, "
5159.32,"especially kids, get beyond four sugary drinks per week, "
5164.26,so four sodas of a typical 
12,"ounce soda, "
5167.15,when they get past four 
12,"ounce sugary sodas, "
5170.15,"they didn't, as far as I know, "
5171.55,look at artificially sweetened sodas. 
5174.2,That's when you start to see a shift towards 
5177.52,"more negative outcomes, more symptoms of existing ADHD. "
5181.98,Now where the controversy comes in 
5184.08,is whether or not sugar consumption 
5186.22,can actually trigger or cause ADHD. 
5188.857,And I don't think we can conclude that at all at this time. 
5192.19,"And this review, if you decide to check it out, "
5195.3,"review/meta-analysis, I should say, "
5197.3,"if you decide to check it out, "
5198.46,goes into some of the nuance around that. 
5200.86,"What's also interesting in terms of ADHD and sugar intake, "
5204.977,"and it probably has relevance to all of us, "
5207.16,is that they also cover some of the interesting data 
5209.66,showing that supplementation with omega-
3,fatty acids 
5214.0,"can actually beneficial for people, "
5217.13,"in particular kids with ADHD, "
5219.36,I've talked before about the utility of omega-
"3s,",
5222.45,that's been shown in various studies 
5223.85,that have compared omega-
3,fatty acid intake 
5226.48,"to say prescription antidepressants, like SSRIs, "
5229.89,"like Prozac, Zoloft, and similar, Fluoxetine, "
5232.79,"and the results of those studies are pretty clear, "
5235.16,"at least to me, "
5236.07,"that provided that one gets at least one gram of EPA, "
5240.63,"essential fatty acids, "
5241.67,"so it's not just getting one gram per day, "
5243.41,but one or more grams per day of the EPA form 
5247.22,"of essential fatty acid, "
5248.56,can rival some prescription antidepressants 
5251.77,and/or decrease the amount of antidepressants 
5255.23,that's required to take. 
5256.21,Which for a lot of people can be a very useful thing 
5258.96,because of the side effect profile 
5260.44,of many of those antidepressants. 
5261.58,"Of course, talk to your psychiatrist, talk to your doctor, "
5263.56,but the omega-
3s,are no doubt powerful. 
5266.29,And then of course there's a whole story 
5267.52,about omega-
3s,and heart health. 
5269.52,"And of course, like anything else, "
5271.14,there's some controversy around omega-
"3s,",
5272.8,but I think the data are clear enough to me 
5274.62,"around mood and cardiovascular health, "
5276.06,that certainly I personally ingest them. 
5277.497,"But as always, I always say, "
5279.83,anytime you're going to add or remove anything 
5282.02,"from your nutrition, supplementation, exercise, "
5284.03,"or otherwise your lifestyle, "
5286.33,definitely consult with a board certified physician. 
5288.29,"I don't just say that to protect me, "
5289.56,"I say that to protect you, "
5291.36,you are responsible for your health ultimately. 
5293.92,So omega-
3,supplementation has been shown to be 
5297.1,beneficial for ADHD. 
5298.39,Why am I talking about this in the context 
5300.04,of an episode on sugar and the nervous system? 
5302.34,"Well, if you remember those neuropod cells, "
5304.99,those cells in your gut that respond to sugar 
5307.16,and send signals up to the brain 
5308.64,to cause the release of dopamine. 
5310.41,"Well, it turns out that neuropod cells also respond to "
5314.58,"amino acids and to fatty acids, "
5317.42,"in particular, essential fatty acids. "
5320.29,"So these cells that we call neuropod cells, "
5323.24,have three jobs. 
5325.3,"One is to levels of sugar in the gut, "
5327.98,"the other is to detect levels of amino acids, "
5331.09,"and to detect levels of particular essential fatty acids, "
5334.76,and communicate that information to the brain. 
5338.38,And I should point out when I say communicate 
5339.99,"that information, they're not actually saying, "
5341.34,"hey, there's amino acids here, "
5342.79,"or hey, there's sugar here, "
5344.54,"or, hey, there's essential fatty acids, "
5346.13,because the language of these cells is somewhat generic. 
5349.19,It's just the firing of electrical potentials. 
5351.74,"But that's the key point, "
5352.8,"it's generic and all three or any of those three, "
5356.6,"sugar, essential fatty acids, or amino acids, "
5359.51,will trigger these neurons to signal 
5361.96,to the brain to increase dopamine. 
5363.26,And it is not coincidental 
5364.97,that omega-
3,fatty acid supplementation can help ameliorate 
5368.53,some of the symptoms of ADHD 
5371.76,by way of presumably increasing dopamine 
5374.98,in this neuropod to dopamine pathway 
5377.19,that we talked about earlier. 
5379.21,The whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it. 
5381.95,"And points to yet again, "
5383.89,"the immense value of bringing the proper amounts, "
5387.63,maybe even supplementing the proper amounts 
5389.57,of omega-
3,fatty acids and the proper amounts of amino acids 
5392.93,into the gut as a way to supplant 
5395.96,some of the stimulation of these pathways 
5398.04,that would otherwise be caused by sugar. 
5401.47,"There's actually a version of this where one could say, "
5404.15,"if you want to reduce sugar cravings, "
5406.82,you might consider increasing certain forms 
5410.61,of amino acid intake or certain forms of fatty acid intake. 
5413.83,"So what are some ways that we can reduce our sugar cravings, "
5417.23,"and ideally ways that we can do that, "
5420.05,"that also benefit us in other ways, "
5422.6,both nutritionally and from the neuroscience standpoint? 
5425.42,"Well, these neuropod cells that respond to "
5429.28,"and signal the brain when we ingest sugar, as I mentioned, "
5433.29,also respond to amino acids and essential fatty acids. 
5436.26,We already talked about the essential fatty acids. 
5438.78,I make it a particular point to ingest anywhere 
5440.8,"from one to three grams, that's grams, "
5443.99,of EPA essential fatty acid per day. 
5447.22,I make it a point to do that with the ingestion 
5448.79,of high quality omega-
3s.,
5451.09,"For me, the simplest way to do that, "
5453.15,"and I think for most people, the lowest cost way to do that, "
5456.46,is to use some liquid form of fish oil 
5458.37,or some capsule form of fish oil. 
5460.12,You really do have to see how much essential fatty acid 
5463.12,in the form of EPA is in those. 
5465.3,"If you try and do that only through capsules, "
5468.02,"it can get kind of expensive, "
5469.14,"depending on which particular brands you use, "
5472.6,"some have more EPA, some less. "
5474.32,"You can, of course also do this through foods, "
5476.16,"you can do this with non fish sources, "
5477.76,"through things like algae, and there's some other forms, "
5480.23,"you can look it up online now, "
5481.86,"plant-based sources of EPAs, "
5484.18,you can do this with high quality fish oil. 
5486.83,"In any case, that does seem at least based on "
5491.21,"a modest amount, but nonetheless solid literature, "
5495.43,"to reduce sugar cravings somewhat, "
5498.44,but that could easily be by mere replacement of calories. 
5502.06,"So we don't know yet based on human studies, "
5504.67,whether or not the ingestion of those EPAs 
5506.47,"is specifically activating the neuropod cells, "
5508.86,which specifically activates dopamine release 
5511.66,"and bypasses the need for, or the craving for sugar. "
5515.19,We don't know that yet. 
5516.21,"But logically, it holds up to assume that. "
5520.62,The fact that these neuropod cells 
5522.25,and I should say other neurons within the gut 
5524.69,respond very robustly to the presence 
5527.95,of particular amino acids is also a potential lever 
5533.04,by which one could reduce sugar cravings. 
5534.78,And there's an interesting literature 
5536.77,"around the amino acid, glutamine, "
5538.63,"in particular supplementing with the amino acid, glutamine, "
5541.48,"as it relates to sugar cravings, "
5543.84,"and certainly as it relates to other aspects of the gut, "
5547.73,in particular leaky gut. 
5549.6,The use of supplemental glutamine to try and treat leaky gut 
5552.7,is not a new phenomenon. 
5554.33,"There are other approaches too, of course. "
5556.3,But there are many people who are experimenting 
5559.35,"with supplementing with glutamine, several grams per day, "
5563.22,"often even, you know, five grams distributed through "
5566.56,three or four different servings throughout the day 
5569.41,as a way to blunt their sugar cravings. 
5571.61,Now there has not yet been a large scale clinical trial 
5575.94,"using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings, "
5577.81,"but the results of the few studies that I looked at, "
5581.35,as well as my understanding of the logic 
5583.66,"of these neuro circuits, including the neuropod cells, "
5586.47,brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense 
5590.1,"why if there's a population of neurons within our gut, "
5593.28,that responds very robustly 
5594.87,"to the presence of sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids, "
5598.53,that the intake of particular amino acids 
5601.2,would allow the dopamine pathways 
5603.73,that might otherwise be triggered by sugar 
5606.35,"to be triggered by something like glutamine, "
5608.62,which has very few or no calories. 
5611.19,"And in fact, having talked about this previously, "
5614.21,"a number of people that I know went out and tried this, "
5617.69,"now this is of course is what I call anec data, right? "
5620.714,"This is not a quality peer reviewed study, "
5623.58,this is anec data. 
5625.74,Many of them have reported back 
5627.56,that they actually feel as if their sugar cravings 
5629.87,are reduced. 
5631.0,I know some people who actually take glutamine 
5632.847,and mix it with full fat cream 
5634.51,"and take it kind of like a shot of full fat cream, "
5636.07,"which sounds absolutely delicious by the way, "
5637.72,"glutamine is a little bit chalky, "
5638.85,so it's not that great tasting to ingest with sugar. 
5642.01,"I should mention, if you do try and take this approach "
5643.99,"of ingesting glutamine to reduce sugar cravings, "
5646.82,you want to increase the amount of glutamine 
5648.41,that you take somewhat gradually. 
5649.93,It can create some gastric distress 
5652.06,"if you just, you know, "
5652.893,"I certainly wouldn't take a big table spoon of it, "
5654.51,throw it in water and chug it down three times a day. 
5656.55,Some of you with very hardy stomachs 
5657.96,can probably tolerate that. 
5659.007,"You know, if you're like my bulldog, "
5662.7,"which unfortunately passed away, but Costello, "
5664.47,"I always imagine that if ever we did an autopsy on him, "
5666.5,he'd have like a license plate 
5667.68,"and like a human being in his gut, "
5669.49,'cause it seemed like he could ingest anything 
5671.07,"with no issues, "
5671.903,"but of course, many people have kind of sensitive guts. "
5674.52,So if you're going to try taking glutamine 
5677.35,"as a means to reduce sugar cravings, "
5679.02,just know that the studies are still ongoing. 
5681.3,Some people have achieved benefit. 
5683.49,Please also realize that there's an entire literature 
5685.78,devoted to the potential hazards of increasing glutamine 
5689.466,if you have a preexisting cancer. 
5692.45,"So if you have cancer or you're cancer prone, "
5694.64,I would really discourage you from this approach. 
5696.67,"And in any case, as always, talk to your doctor. "
5699.84,"The logic nonetheless is there, "
5701.44,why increasing amino acid intake or fatty acid intake 
5705.82,might decrease sugar craving. 
5708.73,Now there are other ways to reduce sugar craving 
5711.74,and there are certainly ways to reduce the sharp 
5714.98,rise in blood glucose that can occur 
5717.42,when we ingest sugary sweet foods 
5719.63,"or even just an abundance of carbohydrate foods, "
5722.5,and there are a huge number of these things. 
5724.59,I'm going to sort of layer up through the ones 
5727.08,"that you might find in your cupboard, at the grocery store, "
5729.04,and then get into some of the more extravagant 
5731.75,"or I should say, esoteric ones, "
5734.12,many of which however can be quite potent. 
5736.6,"The first of which is simple lemon juice, right, "
5740.99,or lime juice. 
5742.4,"There was an old lore and actually some papers, "
5745.54,"pointing to the idea that the ingestion of vinegar, "
5748.89,"either white vinegar or wine vinegar, "
5751.93,could somehow blunt blood glucose 
5754.66,after the ingestion of sugary foods 
5756.3,"or the ingestion of a lot of carbohydrate foods, "
5758.44,or even just a big meal. 
5760.29,"Actually, Tim Ferris, I should say the great Tim Ferris, "
5763.01,'cause I do have great respect for the fact 
5764.57,that he seems to be about 
10,"years ahead of everything, "
5768.07,both in terms of nutrition and skill learning 
5770.17,"and things of that sort, "
5771.003,"many of the things that he predicted in his books, "
5773.457,"""The Four Hour Body"" and ""The Four Hour Chef"" "
5775.75,"actually turned out to be true based on scientific data, "
5779.31,"some of which only exists in the animal models, "
5781.25,but now also some predictions that played out to be true 
5786.51,in both the animal models and and the human models. 
5788.58,So I think that Tim certainly deserves a hat tip 
5793.55,for the fact that he experimented with these methods 
5796.036,and reported his experiences with those methods 
5799.32,"and that now some of them, many of them, "
5801.73,have been validated by what I perceive to be 
5803.85,quality science. 
5805.25,"He talked about the fact that, "
5807.06,"at least in his experiments on himself, "
5809.66,the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt 
5813.47,"blood glucose, and he was using continuous glucose monitors. "
5816.13,"These incidentally, another example of where Ferris "
5818.53,was early to the game and the rest of us 
5821.08,are kind of just in his wake. 
5822.7,"He talked about the use of blood glucose monitors, "
5825.78,"those, I think at the time were implanted below the skin. "
5827.94,"Nowadays there are less invasive blood glucose monitors, "
5831.09,"things like Levels and so forth, "
5832.31,and these are actually becoming pretty popular. 
5834.1,I've worn one of these before. 
5835.25,They're actually pretty informative. 
5837.22,"I learned for instance, that when I go in the sauna "
5839.94,that I experience a sharp rise in blood glucose. 
5843.37,And that makes sense because of the dehydration associated 
5847.23,"with being in the sauna, a lot of sweating, "
5848.66,the concentration of sugar in the bloodstream goes up. 
5851.41,So there's some other things that certain foods 
5853.12,affect my blood glucose one way or another. 
5854.58,It's kind of an interesting and fun experiment 
5856.97,that some of you might be interested in doing as well. 
5859.88,"Regardless, there are now data pointing to the fact "
5863.69,"that lemon juice and lime juice, "
5866.37,"a couple tablespoons or so, "
5868.5,"if ingested before, or even during, or even after, "
5871.39,"consumption of sugary foods, "
5873.34,or I should say foods that sharply increase blood glucose 
5877.13,"or large carbohydrate meals, "
5878.66,can actually blunt the blood glucose response. 
5880.89,And I did see that when I did my own experiments on myself 
5884.29,"with a continuous glucose monitor, "
5886.59,it was kind of fun to do those experiments. 
5889.66,I preferred to do those experiments 
5891.05,by eating somewhat larger meals 
5892.72,of things that didn't contain a lot of sugar. 
5894.8,I saw some big increases in blood glucose 
5896.62,"in certain instances, "
5897.5,"and then I would ingest some lemon juice or lime juice, "
5900.26,typically mixed in with water. 
5901.73,"And sure enough, you could see a blunting "
5903.42,of the blood glucose response. 
5904.67,"And of course this was real time, continuous, "
5907.83,"hence continuous, blood glucose monitoring. "
5910.97,So for those of you that are interested 
5913.0,"in blunting your blood sugar response, certain foods, "
5917.27,"that's a simple, low cost way to do that, "
5919.33,if you want to explore it. 
5920.18,"I will say, if you are fasting "
5923.02,"and you already have low blood glucose, "
5925.18,"and you ingest lemon juice, "
5927.77,or I should say some lemon juice and water 
5929.53,"or lime juice and water, "
5931.3,be careful because you can actually become hypoglycemic. 
5934.72,For the very same reasons that that lemon juice 
5937.82,and lime juice can blunt blood glucose 
5939.67,"when your blood glucose levels are moderate to high, "
5942.51,you can also reduce blood glucose levels even further 
5945.01,when blood glucose levels are low. 
5947.77,Now that's lemon juice and lime juice there. 
5950.16,"But we can't say that has to do with acidic things, "
5953.15,generally. 
5954.21,"And just as a side point, "
5956.12,"many of you have probably seen in the store, "
5957.96,so called adjusted pH waters or foods and drinks 
5961.42,that are supposed to adjust your pH. 
5963.01,"Hate to break it to you, "
5963.92,but your pH is very tightly regulated 
5966.47,throughout your brain and body. 
5967.95,You do not want this to change. 
5969.7,"It is entirely impossible, at least in any safe way, "
5973.8,that you would become quote unquote more alkaline 
5975.99,by ingesting an alkaline water or something like that. 
5978.4,"It is true that the pH, your alkalinity and acidity "
5982.17,"varies in different compartments in your body, "
5983.9,that's important. 
5985.27,"Unless you are hemorrhaging or vomiting, "
5988.22,"or there's something badly wrong with you, health wise, "
5990.69,"and you're in a really dire circumstance, "
5992.78,you don't want big shifts in your body pH 
5994.82,and your body has all sorts of ways of buffering against 
5998.37,changes in pH. 
5999.39,"So I encourage you not to fall on the, "
6002.65,or hop on the bandwagon of adjusting pH 
6005.11,"and becoming less acidic, and that kind of thing. "
6006.72,"When you ingest lemon juice or lime juice, "
6008.77,the mechanism by which it blunts blood glucose 
6011.56,is probably twofold. 
6013.27,One is probably through the post-ingestive effects 
6017.19,"of glucose in the gut, "
6018.56,meaning the way in which sugars are interacting 
6022.85,with neurons and other components of your gut circuitry 
6026.34,"to impact things like gastric emptying time, "
6030.48,to impact things like the firing of those neuropod cells 
6033.907,and their signaling to the brain. 
6035.84,But almost certainly it has something to do also 
6040.12,with the perception of sour taste on the tongue. 
6043.29,"We didn't go into this too much today, but you, of course, "
6047.35,"don't just have sweet taste receptors in your mouth, "
6049.86,"you also have bitter taste receptors, "
6051.26,"you have salty taste receptors, "
6053.09,you have sour taste receptors in your mouth 
6055.34,"and of course, that means your tongue and palate. "
6058.5,And those are interacting. 
6060.37,"If you ingest a substance that's just sweet or mostly sweet, "
6065.98,"that causes a certain set of effects on your blood glucose, "
6068.85,"but also your brain, dopamine, "
6070.51,and the other neuro circuits of your brain. 
6072.65,If you also ingest something that's sour 
6075.77,"like lemon juice or lime juice, "
6077.85,it adjusts the output of those neural circuits 
6080.94,in your brain. 
6081.86,"So again, where you have a situation "
6083.63,"where you have two parallel pathways, "
6085.29,one that's post-ingestive coming from phenomenon 
6087.83,"within our gut neurons, "
6090.02,"but also things like gastric emptying time, "
6091.67,"the clearance and transfer of food, "
6095.55,and the conversion of food into particular nutrients 
6098.47,and the circulation of glucose in your bloodstream 
6101.39,and how it gets into the brain. 
6102.7,"But also simply by ingesting something sour, "
6105.96,you are changing the way 
6107.02,that sweet things impact your brain. 
6110.3,And so I think it stands to reason 
6112.49,that the lemon juice/lime juice effect 
6115.19,is not going to be magic. 
6117.1,It's going to have everything to do with the way 
6118.8,that ingesting sour foods can adjust the taste. 
6122.57,"Excuse me, can adjust the neural response "
6125.62,to taste of sweet foods. 
6127.0,"And in fact, we know based on the beautiful work "
6129.36,"of Charles Zuker at Columbia Medical School, "
6133.15,that that's exactly what I happens. 
6134.88,They've measured the activity of neurons 
6137.15,at various locations in the so-called 
6138.82,taste pathways of the brain. 
6140.43,And they found that when particular tastes 
6143.47,like just sweet or just bitter or just sour 
6145.86,evoke certain ensembles of neurons to fire 
6148.7,"in particular sequences, "
6150.36,"when sweet and sour are co-ingested, "
6152.84,"when bitter and sour are co-ingested, "
6155.53,"you get distinct ensembles, "
6157.53,meaning distinct patterns of activity of those neurons. 
6160.03,"And of course, distinct patterns of downstream activity "
6163.25,within the brain and body. 
6164.41,So while it is still somewhat mysterious 
6167.48,as to how exactly things like lemon juice and lime juice 
6170.69,can reduce our blood glucose spikes. 
6173.73,When we ingest those with sweet foods 
6176.51,"or carbohydrate laden foods, or with big meals, "
6179.74,you can use this as a tool with the understanding 
6181.69,that there's a grounding in the biology 
6183.65,of the way these circuits work. 
6185.14,"Now, some of you have probably heard that cinnamon "
6187.22,can be a useful tool for controlling blood sugar. 
6189.4,And indeed that's the case. 
6190.93,It's very clear that cinnamon can adjust 
6193.69,"the rate of glucose entry into the stream, "
6196.5,"possibly by changing the rate of gastric emptying, "
6199.9,it might slow the rate of gastric emptying 
6202.88,and thereby also reduce the glycemic index 
6206.22,of particular foods. 
6207.22,"So I suppose if I were going to eat a mango, "
6209.72,"and I hadn't just done a bunch of hard training, "
6211.62,I might sprinkle some cinnamon on it here. 
6213.58,I always enjoy kind of coming up with new ideas 
6215.41,of ways that I can eat foods during these podcasts. 
6218.19,"In any event, there's some debate out there, "
6219.96,"if you look online as to whether or not Saigon Cinnamon, "
6222.08,"Cassia cinnamon, excuse me, or Ceylon cinnamon is best "
6226.09,for purposes of blunting blood glucose spikes. 
6229.63,"But I think the, at least by my read of the data "
6234.39,"and from what I've found, "
6235.57,it doesn't really matter provided it's real cinnamon. 
6237.82,And you have to actually look and make sure 
6239.67,"that it's real cinnamon, "
6240.93,because a lot of cinnamon that you buy is not real. 
6243.38,I do want to provide a cautionary note about cinnamon however. 
6246.63,Cinnamon contains something called coumarin. 
6249.27,which can be toxic at high levels. 
6252.27,"So you don't want to ingest more than about a teaspoon, "
6255.67,"maybe a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon per day, "
6258.87,because you'll start to exceed the threshold 
6260.49,at which cinnamon could start to be problematic. 
6263.37,But certainly if you're going to have a big meal 
6266.57,"or a meal that has a lot of sugar in it, "
6269.14,"or a lot of carbohydrate laden foods, "
6271.61,"and you don't want an increase in blood glucose, "
6274.1,"you could put cinnamon in a beverage, "
6276.96,you could put cinnamon on food 
6278.25,"in order to blunt that blood glucose increase, "
6281.58,reduce the glycemic index 
6282.81,by way of reducing gastric emptying time. 
6284.7,"Again, just making sure that you don't get out past "
6287.15,"that one and a half teaspoons per day, "
6288.897,'cause you really don't want to start dealing 
6291.41,with any of the toxicity related to coumarin. 
6293.34,So we've talked about lemon juice and lime juice 
6295.58,"and cinnamon, these are kind of commonplace "
6297.2,in many kitchens. 
6299.67,Then of course we can venture into the more esoteric 
6303.07,or I would say the more advanced tools 
6304.87,for adjusting sugar intake. 
6307.72,And the one that comes to mind is of course Berberine. 
6311.97,Berberine is a derivative of tree bark 
6314.6,"and it is a very, very potent substance "
6317.17,for reducing blood glucose. 
6318.33,So much so that it is on par with 
6320.72,"Metformin or Glibenclamide, "
6322.49,which are prescription drugs specifically used 
6325.45,to reduce blood glucose. 
6327.43,"So using Berberine is a serious step, "
6330.62,you should absolutely talk to your doctor about it. 
6333.0,I know of a number of people that use it 
6334.34,to lower blood glucose when they eat really large meals. 
6337.73,I know the number of people that are using it 
6339.67,to get to some of the other effects of Metformin 
6343.59,"that people have discussed, "
6344.61,things like activating or tapping into the so-called 
6348.314,"AMPK pathway, reducing mTOR, "
6350.33,these are people that are aiming their activities 
6354.05,"at increasing longevity, "
6355.99,"a somewhat controversial approach, still, "
6358.06,but I know many people are doing it. 
6360.72,"It is true that if you ingest Berberine, "
6363.1,your blood glucose will plummet. 
6365.46,"And I point that out because I've actually tried it before, "
6368.1,"it gave me brutal headaches and I felt really dizzy, "
6371.7,and I felt like I couldn't see straight. 
6373.78,"And actually I couldn't see straight, why did it do that? "
6376.48,"Well, it made me hypoglycemic. "
6378.58,It actually drove my blood glucose down too far. 
6381.85,And the reason it did that 
6383.18,is that I took Berberine on an empty stomach. 
6385.82,I know some people can tolerate it. 
6388.43,"I would say, be very cautious about ingesting Berberine "
6390.98,"on an empty stomach, "
6391.813,"or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet, "
6394.2,unless you really know what you're doing 
6395.67,and you have a medical professional 
6396.99,to kind of guide you through that. 
6399.66,"If I took Berberine along with a very large meal, "
6403.64,"that included a lot of carbohydrates, you know, "
6405.79,I can recall the days in which Costello and I would eat 
6408.61,"a couple of pizzas and then we might get ice cream, "
6411.11,that kind of thing. 
6411.943,Then I felt perfectly fine on even up to 
750,milligrams 
6415.78,or a gram of Berberine. 
6417.42,It has the kind of unique property of making you feel 
6420.9,not overwhelmed by the amount of blood glucose increase 
6424.55,that you're experiencing from eating a big meal. 
6426.4,I don't quite know how else to describe it. 
6428.55,"It's almost as if you can keep eating and eating and eating, "
6430.95,and of course you have to protect your gastric volume. 
6435.62,"I mean, you only have so much space in your stomach "
6437.45,to ingest food. 
6439.12,"I wasn't using it to gorge on food, I just heard about it, "
6441.73,I was interested in experimenting with it. 
6443.13,I don't have any chronic blood sugar issues. 
6445.76,"But again, when I took it on an empty stomach, "
6447.64,"it made me hypoglycemic on a low carbohydrate intake, "
6451.45,"hypoglycemic, not a good experience. "
6454.52,"And again, an experience I think to avoid. "
6457.84,"But provided there's a lot of glucose in your bloodstream, "
6460.52,and certainly if you are of the experimental type 
6464.05,"or you're trying to regulate blood glucose, "
6465.85,Berberine might be a good option. 
6467.54,"But again, talk to your doctor. "
6469.56,It does have some other interesting effects 
6471.25,in terms of lowering total cholesterol 
6473.61,that are research supported 
6475.64,of reducing insulin a little bit. 
6478.48,"Well, that's not surprising if you reduce blood glucose, "
6480.47,"you're going to reduce insulin because of course, "
6482.21,insulin manages blood glucose in the bloodstream. 
6485.5,"So I would place Berberine and of course, "
6487.58,Metformin and Glibenclamide in the kind of the heavy hitting 
6491.74,potent tools for regulating blood glucose. 
6494.95,"Now, this is an episode, not about sugar per se, "
6497.83,but sugar viewed through the lens of the nervous system. 
6500.68,And what's interesting about 
6501.64,"Berberine, Metformin, Glibenclamide and related substances, "
6505.36,is that some of the effects are of course on 
6509.21,gastric emptying or buffering blood glucose 
6511.1,"within the bloodstream, et cetera. "
6513.86,But there appeared to also be some neural effects 
6517.33,of having chronically low glucose 
6520.88,or blunting blood glucose through things like Berberine. 
6524.56,And some of those neural effects include 
6527.2,longstanding changes in the hormonal cascades 
6531.03,that are the consequence of having low blood sugar 
6533.39,"and thereby, changes in the neural circuits "
6536.75,that manage blood glucose overall. 
6538.89,The simple way of saying this is that by maintaining 
6542.32,"low to moderate blood glucose, "
6543.84,either by not ingesting heavily carbohydrate laden foods. 
6547.57,So here I'm speaking to the low carb or the ketogenic types 
6550.78,or by blunting blood glucose through things like 
6553.59,"Metformin or Berberine, "
6555.64,"even if ingesting carbohydrates, maybe even some sugars, "
6558.47,"over time, it seems that there's a adjustment, "
6561.7,what we call a homeostatic regulation 
6564.0,of the neural circuits that control things like 
6565.89,"sugar craving, and indeed, "
6567.8,some people report feeling fewer sugar cravings over time. 
6571.73,"Now I didn't use Berberine for a very long period of time, "
6574.94,I've never used Metformin. 
6576.56,I have experienced a somewhat odd but welcome phenomenon 
6580.16,"of with each progressive year of my life, "
6582.93,I have fewer and fewer sugar cravings. 
6585.76,"Why that is, I don't know. "
6586.99,I suspect it might have something to do with my sleep. 
6589.34,And I'll talk about that in a few minutes. 
6591.28,But if you're going to explore 
6592.64,"Berberine or Metformin or otherwise, "
6594.15,"in addition to working with a doctor, "
6596.08,"I think you should understand why you're doing it, right. "
6598.72,I think that many of the effects can be quite potent. 
6601.81,They can happen in both the immediate term 
6604.14,"in terms of regulating blood glucose, "
6605.86,"they can send you hypoglycemic if you aren't careful, "
6609.29,they can also cause longstanding changes 
6612.34,to the neural circuitry that regulates 
6613.95,blood sugar over time. 
6615.03,"Some of which might be welcome changes, right? "
6616.95,Reduce sugar cravings for instance. 
6619.04,"And if you are really, really serious "
6621.69,about modulating blood glucose 
6623.55,"through things like Berberine, "
6625.4,"the typical dose range, again, "
6626.87,is anywhere from half a gram to 
1.5,"grams daily, "
6630.59,that's the typical dosages that have been explored. 
6633.22,And there are some other substances like sodium caprate 
6637.61,which are known to augment the effects of Berberine 
6640.16,via the AMPK pathways. 
6642.23,They basically can increase the ability for Berberine 
6645.21,to have its glucose lowering actions. 
6647.37,"But that of course is getting into the really potent, "
6649.84,what I would call sharp blade tools 
6651.63,for controlling blood glucose. 
6653.6,"And listen, anytime you're dealing with blood glucose, "
6656.88,you are dealing with the brain's preferred source of fuel. 
6660.15,And anytime you're dealing 
6660.983,"with the brain's preferred source of fuel, "
6663.3,you have to be especially cautious 
6664.81,about depriving the brain of what it needs. 
6667.05,"So whether or not you're low carb, high carb, "
6670.16,"you know, keto, vegan, carnivore, these substances, "
6673.36,"like Berberine, are very, very potent "
6675.07,and you need to take them seriously. 
6676.7,There is yet another tool for controlling sugar cravings 
6680.01,and the neural circuits that regulate sugar craving 
6683.76,and its downstream consequences. 
6686.33,"And this tool is what I would call a high performance tool, "
6690.25,but it's one that you probably didn't suspect 
6693.89,and that's sleep. 
6696.02,"I've done extensive episodes about sleep, "
6698.7,and we actually have an episode called master your sleep. 
6702.02,You can find that episode easily at hubermanlab.com. 
6704.46,"It's available in all the various formats, "
6706.03,"YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. "
6707.91,and it provides a lot of tools. 
6709.69,"And on social media, I provide a lot of tools, "
6711.67,often we have a newsletter that provides tools 
6713.2,on how to maximize sleep. 
6716.2,"What is the role of sleep in sugar metabolism, "
6720.58,"sugar, hunger, and the way that the brain "
6723.41,regulates those things? 
6724.66,"Well, there's a really exciting study that came out "
6728.25,just last year. 
6730.017,"This study was published in the journal, Cell Report, "
6731.94,"a Cell Press journal, excellent journal. "
6734.12,"And the reason I love this study so much, "
6736.1,"is it involved having people, "
6737.48,"so yes, this was done in humans, sleep in the laboratory. "
6740.56,"That's not unusual, there's a sleep lab at Stanford, "
6742.77,there's sleep labs elsewhere. 
6744.42,But what they did was they actually measured 
6747.77,"from the breath of these people, "
6750.27,"and they extracted from their breath, "
6753.34,the metabolites that would allow them 
6755.39,to understand what sorts of metabolism 
6758.28,was occurring in these people's bodies 
6760.05,at different phases of sleep. 
6762.17,And this is a really remarkable study. 
6764.2,They actually did this every 
10,seconds 
6767.7,throughout the entire night. 
6768.8,So in little tiny 
10,"second bits, "
6770.85,"meaning at very high resolution, "
6772.48,they could evaluate what is the metabolism 
6774.26,in the brain and body that people experience 
6776.28,"as they go from REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep "
6778.59,"to slow wave, sleep, and so on. "
6780.79,"And I'll go deeper into the study again in the future, "
6783.55,"because it's so interesting, and I think so important. "
6785.8,But what they discovered was that each stage of sleep 
6789.43,was associated with a very particular signature pattern 
6792.43,of metabolism and particular phases of sleep 
6796.15,"are associated with sugar metabolism, "
6798.62,"or more with fat metabolism, "
6800.5,or more with other aspects of metabolism. 
6803.21,And the reason why I think this study is important 
6806.22,to discuss in the context of today's discussion 
6808.61,"about sugar in the brain, "
6810.15,is that many people have experienced 
6813.84,the effects of disrupted sleep on their appetite. 
6816.96,"And in particular, it's been reported that when people "
6819.91,are sleep deprived or the quality 
6821.79,"of their sleep is disrupted, "
6823.69,that their appetite for sugary food increases. 
6826.78,Now that was always assumed to be due to some metabolic need 
6832.3,that was triggered by the sleep deprivation 
6834.12,or by the poor sleep. 
6835.59,"But in reading over this study, "
6836.78,some of the more important points made by the authors 
6839.12,"relate to the fact that well, "
6840.71,sleep is known to have incredibly important effects 
6843.56,"on brain and body, for a variety of systems, "
6845.92,"immune system, neural functioning, et cetera. "
6848.88,This very organized sequence of particular 
6852.57,forms of metabolism being active 
6854.89,"during particular phases of sleep, "
6856.57,"which are very, very well orchestrated, "
6858.52,"as we know, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep "
6860.91,being orchestrated in 
90,"minutes, "
6862.36,"so-called ultradian cycles and so on and so forth, "
6865.9,is thought to of perhaps set up the brain and body 
6869.21,to be able to regulate itself in the waking hours. 
6872.4,"And therefore, when people are sleep deprived "
6875.12,"or deprived of certain forms or states within sleep, "
6878.81,"such as rapid eye movement sleep, "
6882.06,that it creates a disruption 
6883.94,in a particular set of metabolic pathways. 
6886.66,Now we don't a leap too far from this study 
6888.77,to sugar metabolism and the neural circuits 
6890.64,controlling sugar metabolism. 
6892.3,"But I will say this, if you look at the sum total "
6896.03,of the data on obesity or on type two diabetes 
6900.7,"or on metabolic syndromes of any kind, "
6902.9,you almost always see disruptions in sleep. 
6906.53,"Now, some of those could be you do to sleep apnea "
6909.27,caused by even just the size of somebody's neck 
6912.01,or the weight of their body. 
6914.89,"In other words, we don't know the direction of the effect, "
6917.27,"metabolic syndromes could disrupt sleep, "
6919.03,which disrupt metabolic syndromes. 
6920.77,"And indeed the authors point out quite appropriately, "
6923.84,that they don't understand the direction 
6925.8,of the effects that they observe either. 
6928.16,But there is now a plethora of data pointing to the fact 
6932.35,that getting quality sleep each night 
6934.52,"helps regulate not only appetite, "
6937.31,but also the specific forms of metabolism 
6939.76,that drive specific appetites. 
6942.18,"So the takeaway is, "
6944.33,while there are extravagant and potent and interesting ways 
6949.89,"to regulate blood glucose, "
6950.97,"everything from cinnamon to lemon juice, to Berberine, "
6953.18,"to sodium caprate, to behavioral tools, "
6956.17,to the mere understanding of how 
6957.69,the direct and indirect pathways 
6960.0,"go from the gut to dopamine, et cetera, "
6963.3,if you're not establishing the firm foundation 
6966.38,"of proper metabolism, "
6969.12,all of those things are going to be sort of rearranging 
6972.5,deck chairs on the Titanic as it's sometimes described. 
6975.92,So we can't overstate the importance 
6977.27,"of getting regular sufficient amount of high quality sleep, "
6981.29,at least 
80%,"of the time, "
6982.867,"not for sake of immune system function, for clear thinking, "
6985.86,"et cetera, but also for properly regulating our metabolism, "
6990.2,including our sugar metabolism. 
6992.1,Thank you for joining me for this discussion 
6993.58,about sugar and the nervous system 
6994.95,and how they are regulating each other 
6996.74,in both the brain and body.

7045.75,"During today's episode, "
7046.78,"and on many previous episodes of The Huberman Lab Podcast, "
7049.48,I've discussed supplements. 
7050.86,"While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, "
7053.07,many people derive tremendous benefit from them. 
7055.36,One issue with supplements 
7056.51,"is that if you're going to take them, "
7058.3,you want to make sure that they have 
7059.32,the absolute highest quality. 
7061.07,"For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, "
7063.01,"that's T-H-O-R-N-E, "
7065.04,"'cause Thorn has partnered for instance, "
7067.14,with all the major sports teams and the Mayo Clinic. 
7070.37,There's tremendous trust in the fact 
7071.96,that Thorne supplements contain 
7073.64,the specific amounts of supplements 
7075.19,that are listed on the bottle 
7076.16,and that the quality of the ingredients they include 
7078.41,are of the very highest standards. 
7081.35,"If you want to see the supplements that I take, "
7082.88,"you can go to thorne.com/U/Huberman, "
7087.1,and you can get 
20%,off any of the supplements listed there. 
7090.28,"Also, if you navigate further into the Thorne site, "
7092.59,"through that portal, thorne.com/U/Huberman, "
7095.74,you can also get 
20%,off any of the other supplements 
7098.34,that Thorne makes.
