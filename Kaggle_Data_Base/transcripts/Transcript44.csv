0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
1.92,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.93,for everyday life. 
6.25,[upbeat music] 
9.24,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.18,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.07,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.92,"Today, my guest is Dr. Rhonda Patrick. "
17.6,Dr. Patrick is known to some of you as a podcaster 
20.61,and one of the premier educators 
22.67,"in the landscape of mitochondria, metabolism, stress, "
26.88,and other aspects of brain and body health. 
29.52,"Her podcast, FoundMyFitness, "
31.98,is one of the premier podcasts in the world 
34.04,for disseminating knowledge 
35.55,about how the brain and body work 
37.47,"and how we can use behavioral tools, micronutrients, "
40.65,supplements and other protocols 
42.91,in order to maximize our immediate and long-term health. 
46.23,"Dr. Patrick did her formal training in cell biology, "
49.54,"exploring the links between mitochondrial metabolism, "
52.8,"apoptosis, which is naturally occurring cell death, "
55.64,which is a healthy form of cell death 
58.0,"that occurs in our brain and body throughout the lifespan, "
60.25,and cancer biology. 
62.5,She then went on to do postdoctoral training 
64.69,"with Dr. Bruce Ames, "
65.76,"investigating the effects of micronutrients, "
67.93,"meaning vitamins and minerals, "
69.56,"and how they affect metabolism, inflammation, "
72.55,"DNA damage, and the aging process. "
75.1,She has published landmark review articles 
77.56,"and primary research, "
79.06,"meaning original research articles, "
81.2,"in some of the premier journals in the world, "
82.93,"including Science, Nature Cell Biology, "
85.73,"Trends in Cell Biology, and FASEB. "
88.1,"Indeed, Dr. Patrick is an expert "
90.29,in an extraordinarily broad range of topics 
93.36,that impact our health. 
94.88,"For today's episode, we focus primarily "
96.9,on the major categories of micronutrients 
99.49,that are essential for brain and body health. 
102.69,I have to confess that before the discussion 
104.6,"with Dr. Patrick, "
105.6,I was aware of only one of the categories 
107.58,"of micronutrients that we discuss, "
109.4,and so you'll notice that I'm wrapped with attention 
111.93,throughout the discussion. 
113.61,And I think that you'll want to have a pen and paper handy 
116.15,because she offers not only a very clear understanding 
119.96,of the biological mechanisms 
121.5,"by which other micronutrients operate, "
124.13,but some very clear and actionable tools and items 
127.88,that we can all embark on 
129.83,if we are to optimize our brain and body health. 
132.69,We also discuss behavioral protocols. 
135.25,Dr. Patrick is well known for her understanding 
137.54,of the scientific literature on sauna 
139.7,and the use of heat and cold for optimizing things 
142.72,"like metabolism, longevity, cardiovascular health, "
145.87,"and I'm delighted to say that we discus that as well, "
148.64,and how behavioral protocols can interface 
151.96,with supplement-based and nutritional protocols. 
154.93,I'm confident that you'll learn a tremendous amount 
156.89,"of information from Dr. Patrick, "
158.95,much of which is immediately actionable. 
161.38,And if you're not already following and listening 
163.12,"to her excellent podcast, you'll absolutely want to do that. "
166.09,It's foundmyfitness.com is the website 
168.97,where you can get access to that podcast. 
170.7,It's also on Apple and Spotify 
173.15,and YouTube as FoundMyFitness. 
175.44,Dr. Patrick also has a terrific newsletter 
177.38,that I recommend signing up for. 
178.7,"It's foundmyfitness.com/newsletter is where you'll find it, "
182.977,"and it includes research on fasting, micronutrients, "
186.75,"sleep, depression, fitness, longevity, and far more, "
189.98,"along, of course, with actionable protocols. "
192.58,I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast 
195.09,is now partnered with Momentous supplements. 
197.73,Our motivation for partnering with Momentous 
199.94,is to provide people one location where they can go 
202.79,to access the highest quality supplements 
205.57,in the specific dosages 
207.37,that are best supported by the scientific research 
210.13,and that are discussed during various episodes 
212.31,of the Huberman Lab Podcast. 
213.91,"If you go to livemomentus.com/huberman, "
217.32,you will see those formulations. 
218.87,I should mention that we are going to add 
220.19,more formulations in the months to come. 
223.1,And you'll see specific suggestions 
225.62,"about how best to take those supplements, "
227.53,"meaning what dosages and times of day, "
229.63,"and, in fact, how to combine those supplements "
232.43,with specific behavioral protocols 
234.7,that have been discussed on the podcast 
236.35,and are science supported 
237.63,in order to drive the maximum benefit 
240.17,from those supplements. 
241.65,And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn 
244.68,that Momentous ships not just within the United States 
247.27,but also internationally. 
248.97,"So, once again, if you go to livemomentus.com/huberman, "
252.67,you'll find what we firmly believe 
254.22,to be the best quality supplements 
256.91,in the precise dosages 
259.56,and the best protocols for taking those supplements 
262.89,along with the ideal behavioral protocols 
265.7,to combine with those supplement formulations. 
267.81,I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events 
270.48,this May. 
271.47,The first live event will be hosted 
272.99,"in Seattle, Washington, on May "
17th.,
275.67,The second live event will be hosted 
277.29,"in Portland, Oregon, on May "
18th.,
279.68,Both are part of a lecture series 
281.15,"entitled ""The Brain Body Contract,"" "
283.27,during which I will discuss science and science-based tools 
286.3,"for mental health, physical health, and performance. "
288.98,"I should point out that, "
290.19,while some of the material I'll cover will overlap 
292.9,with information covered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast 
295.457,"and on various social media posts, "
297.51,most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct 
300.67,from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere. 
303.57,"So, once again, it's Seattle on May "
"17th,",
306.1,Portland on May 
18th.,
307.42,"You can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com/tour, "
311.54,and I hope to see you there. 
312.83,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
315.37,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
318.3,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
320.51,to bring zero cost to consumer information 
322.41,about science and science-related tools 
324.55,to the general public. 
325.94,"In keeping with that theme, "
327.0,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
329.73,Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. 
331.96,"Athletic Greens is an all-in-one, "
333.49,vitamin mineral probiotic drink. 
335.92,I've been taking Athletic Greens since 
"2012,",
338.8,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
341.25,"The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, "
342.96,and the reason I still take Athletic Greens 
344.39,"once or twice a day, "
345.66,is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. 
348.42,It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. 
350.93,"In addition, it has probiotics "
352.92,which are vital for microbiome health. 
355.55,I've done a couple of episodes now 
357.4,on the so-called gut microbiome 
359.34,and the ways in which the microbiome interacts 
362.1,"with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood "
365.17,and essentially with every biological system 
367.33,relevant to health throughout your brain and body. 
370.08,"With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need, "
371.88,"the minerals I need, "
372.87,and the probiotics to support my microbiome. 
375.65,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
377.21,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
379.68,and claim a special offer. 
381.15,"They'll give you five free travel packs, "
382.93,which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
384.66,"while you're on the road, "
385.79,plus a year's supply of vitamin D
3,K
2.,
389.04,There are a ton of data now showing 
390.58,that vitamin D is essential 
392.3,for various aspects of our brain and body health. 
394.54,"Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, "
396.63,many of us are still deficient in vitamin D
3.,
398.51,And K
2,is also important because it regulates things 
401.46,"like cardiovascular function, "
402.64,"calcium in the body, and so on. "
404.98,"Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman "
407.79,to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs 
410.28,and the year's supply of vitamin D
3,K
2.,
412.79,Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis. 
415.45,"Thesis makes what are called nootropics, "
417.76,which means smart drugs. 
419.5,"Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics. "
422.84,I don't believe in smart drugs 
424.78,in the sense that I don't believe 
425.94,that there's any one substance or collection of substances 
428.8,that can make us smarter. 
430.49,"I do believe, based on science, however, "
432.84,that there are particular neural circuits 
434.38,"and brain functions that allow us to be more focused, "
436.92,"more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera. "
440.64,That's just the way that the brain works. 
442.04,Different neural circuits for different brain states. 
444.55,And so the idea of a nootropic 
445.89,that's just going to make us smarter all around 
447.74,"fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things, right? "
450.97,"If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math, "
453.03,"you're doing accounting, "
454.44,"a different part of the day, you need to be creative, "
456.08,these are all different brain processes. 
458.3,"Thesis understands this, "
459.81,"and, as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company "
462.14,to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes. 
465.43,"They only use the highest quality ingredients, "
466.97,"which, of course, is essential. "
468.32,"Some of those I've talked about on the podcast, "
470.01,"things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine. "
473.89,They give you the ability to try several different blends 
475.98,"over the course of a month, "
477.25,discover which nootropics work best 
478.98,"for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals, "
482.27,"and, with that personalization, "
484.2,design a kit of nootropics that's ideal 
487.11,for the different brain and body states you want to access. 
489.57,"I've been using Thesis for more than six months now, "
491.88,and I can confidently say that their nootropics 
493.413,have been a total game-changer. 
495.48,"My go-to formula is the Clarity formula, "
498.15,or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training. 
501.3,"To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, "
503.34,"go online to takethesis.com/huberman, "
506.27,"take a three-minute quiz, "
507.27,and Thesis will send you four different formulas 
509.26,to try in your first month. 
510.9,That's takethesis.com/huberman 
513.08,and use the code Huberman at checkout 
514.71,for 
10%,off your first order. 
516.85,Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
519.82,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
522.53,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
525.07,to help you better understand your body 
526.64,and help you reach your health goals. 
528.54,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
531.3,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
533.64,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
535.71,can only be assessed with a quality blood test. 
538.23,"What's unique about InsideTracker is that, "
539.87,while there are a lot of different tests out there 
542.1,"for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera, "
544.8,"with InsideTracker, you get the numbers back "
546.78,"in terms of your levels, "
547.93,but they also give you very clear directives 
549.94,"in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation "
552.65,that can help you bring those values into the ranges 
555.28,that are best for you and your health goals. 
557.34,"And that's very different than a lot of the other programs, "
559.61,"where you get a lot of information, "
560.443,but you don't really know what to do with that information. 
562.55,InsideTracker makes that all very easy to understand 
565.42,and very actionable 
566.66,based on the very easy-to-use dashboard at InsideTracker. 
570.02,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "

579.2,And now for my discussion with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. 
582.44,"Rhonda, welcome. "
583.73,This has been a long time coming. 
585.5,"Even longer than you know because, even before we discussed "
588.5,"you coming on this podcast as a guest, "
590.64,I've been watching your content for a very long time. 
593.08,So I want to start off by saying thank you. 
594.92,You were the spearhead to break through 
598.41,from academic science to public education. 
601.74,"So I consider you first in, "
604.6,and the rest of us are just in your wake. 
606.7,"So, thank you for that. It's been- "
608.83,"- Oh, that is so kind. "
609.97,Thank you. Thank you so much. 
610.89,"Well, it's absolutely true. "
612.16,- I am so excited to be here 
613.44,having a conversation with you. 
615.061,- Thank you. 
615.92,It's absolutely true. 
616.94,"If anyone does their research, they'll realize "
619.653,that the statement I just made is absolutely true 
621.62,and there isn't even a close second. 
623.72,Any other public facing educators 
626.24,that have formal science training 
628.36,and do regular posting of content 
632.89,"came in several years after you initiated it, "
634.93,so we're all grateful. 
637.99,"I have so many questions, but I want to start off "
640.6,with kind of a new but old theme 
644.8,that you're very familiar with. 
646.38,"So temperature is a powerful stimulus, "
649.44,"as we know, for biology, "
650.9,and you've covered a lot of material 
653.09,related to the utility of cold 
656.24,"but also the utility of heat, "
658.3,"and, as I learn more and more from your content "
661.33,"and from the various papers, "
663.02,it seems that there's a bit of a conundrum 
667.11,"in that cold can stimulate a number of things, "
670.57,"like increases in metabolism, brown fat, "
672.31,"et cetera, et cetera. "
673.15,"Hopefully, you'll tell us more about those. "
674.93,But heat seems to be able to do a lot of the same things. 
678.38,"And I wonder whether or not the discomfort of cold, "
682.69,"deliberate cold exposure, and the discomfort of heat "
685.1,might be anchoring to the same pathway. 
688.25,"So, would you mind sharing with us "
689.66,a little bit about what happens 
691.86,"when we get into a cold environment on purpose, "
694.77,and what happens when we get 
696.02,into a hot environment on purpose? 
698.11,And I'm hoping that this might eventually lead us 
700.14,"to some point of convergent understanding, so if you would. "
705.01,- I would love to. Let's take a step back. 
707.41,I think you brought up a really important point here. 
709.99,And I think that point 
710.99,has to do with the intermittent challenging of yourself 
715.13,"and whether that is through temperature changes, "
718.63,"like cold or heat, "
719.86,"or through other types of stressors, like physical activity, "
724.53,or perhaps even dietary compounds that are found in plants. 
728.93,These are things like polyphenols or flavanols. 
732.04,"Humans, we evolved to intermittently challenge ourselves. "
736.95,"And before we had Instacart, where you could basically "
740.62,"just get your food delivered to you, "
742.3,"before the Industrial Revolution occurred, "
746.07,we were out hunting. 
748.23,"And I say, we, not us but humans. "
751.11,We were out gathering. 
752.91,"We were moving, and we had to be physically fit. "
756.21,You couldn't catch your prey 
757.94,"if you were a sedentary slob, right? "
760.09,"You were moving, and you had to pick your berries. "
762.83,You had to move. 
763.663,"And so physical activity was a part of everyday life, "
768.32,and caloric restriction or intermittent fasting 
771.04,was also a part of it. 
772.456,This is another type of challenge. 
774.34,"We didn't always have a prey that we caught, "
777.66,or maybe temperatures were such that there was nothing 
780.85,"for us to gather, right? "
782.01,So food scarcity was something common 
784.7,"as well as eating plants, "
786.2,so getting these compounds that I mentioned. 
789.03,"These are all types of stress, intermittent challenges, "
792.55,that activate genetic pathways in our bodies. 
796.3,These are often referred to in science 
798.67,as stress response pathways 
800.81,because they respond to a little bit of stress. 
803.3,Physical activity is strenuous. 
805.04,"Fasting's a little bit stressful. Heat, cold. "
807.36,These things are all types 
808.51,of little intermittent challenges. 
810.58,And there is a lot of crosstalk between these stressors 
815.93,and the genetic pathways that they activate. 
818.64,And these genetic pathways that are activated 
821.07,help you deal with stress. 
822.714,And they do it in a way that is not only beneficial 
826.79,"to help you deal with that little stressor, "
828.92,"exercise or heat, "
830.394,"it stays active, and it helps you deal with the stress "
833.54,"of normal metabolism, normal immune function happening, "
837.0,"just life, aging, right? "
838.62,So this concept is referred to as hormesis. 
841.38,This is a little bit of stressful challenge 
844.74,that activates these stress response pathways 
846.78,"in a beneficial way, that is a net positive, "
849.08,"that actually has a very profound antioxidant, "
853.14,"anti-inflammatory response, or whatever the response is. "
856.16,It could be the production of more stem cells. 
859.13,These are cells that help regenerate 
860.54,"different cells within tissues, "
862.82,"or something like autophagy, "
864.55,which is a process that can clear away 
866.43,"all the gunk inside of our cells, "
868.28,"pieces of DNA, protein aggregates. "
870.7,So you'll find that the stress response pathways 
874.45,are activated by a variety of stressors. 
877.93,"So, for example, one pathway is called heat shock proteins, "
881.25,"and, as their name would imply, one would go, "
882.817,"""Oh, they're activated by heat."" "
884.73,"Well, correct. They are activated very robustly by heat. "
887.41,And we can talk about that. 
889.46,"You can eat a plant like broccoli sprouts, "
893.05,which is high in something called sulforaphane. 
894.92,"This is a compound that is sort of like a hormetic compound, "
898.81,"or, as David Sinclair likes to say, "
900.117,it's a xenohormetic compound. 
901.98,I love that. I love that term. 
904.67,And it activates heat shock proteins among other things. 
907.71,It also activates a very powerful detoxification pathway 
910.84,called Nrf
"2,",which helps you detoxify things 
914.23,like carcinogens that you're exposed to. 
915.78,"Well, guess what? Heat activates that. "
917.7,So what I'm getting at is there is overlap. 
920.71,Cold also activates heat shock proteins. 
922.83,"You're like, ""Really? Cold?"" Yes, it activates. "
925.26,"These are stress response pathways, "
927.67,and they are activated by various types of stressors. 
930.58,"Now, you're going to more robustly activate heat shock proteins "
934.3,"from heat versus cold, but there is some overlap. "
939.26,So I think that sort of forms the foundation there. 
942.89,"- Yeah, that's very helpful. "
944.33,"And it brings to mind, in the context of the nervous system, "
947.77,I always tell people you only have a small kit 
951.08,of neurochemicals to work with. 
952.85,"There isn't dopamine for Netflix, "
955.81,"and then dopamine for relationship, "
957.26,"and dopamine for work, et cetera. "
959.88,"Dopamine is a generic pathway by which motivation, craving, "
962.96,"and pursuit emerge, et cetera, "
965.85,just like adrenaline is a generic theme 
969.02,of many different behaviors. 
970.65,It seems that it is the job of biological systems 
973.72,"to be able to take a diverse range of inputs, "
975.99,even unknown inputs. 
977.77,"Like, we don't know what technology "
979.39,"will look like in three years, "
980.86,but you can bet that some of those novel technologies 
982.74,will tap into the very systems that I'm talking about now. 
985.03,And there certainly will be other stressors to come about 
988.78,that will tap into these pathways. 
990.4,I have two questions related to what you just said 
993.21,before we talk a little bit more about cold and heat. 
996.13,You mentioned plants as a route 
999.67,to creating intermittent challenge. 
1002.89,"There's a lot of debate, mostly online, "
1005.23,about whether or not plants are our friends 
1006.67,or plants are trying to kill us. 
1008.41,"The extreme version from the carnivore types, "
1011.54,"pure carnivore diet types, "
1012.64,is that plants are trying to kill us. 
1014.46,"From the plant-based diet folks, "
1016.07,it seems like it's more about what's healthy 
1018.92,"for the planet, animals, and maybe for us. "
1021.23,"But, if we set aside that argument, "
1023.52,and we just raise the hypothesis 
1025.61,"that plants have compounds that are bad for us, "
1029.46,"but maybe by consuming them in small amounts, "
1032.12,"they're creating this hormesis type scenario, "
1035.53,so then I think we conceivably solve the problem. 
1040.11,"We could say, yes, plants are bad for us, "
1044.4,"but, in small amounts, they provide this hormetic response "
1047.02,"and they're good for us, right? "
1048.27,"So, in the same way that too much heat is bad for us, "
1051.65,"too much cold is bad for us, can kill us, can kill neurons, "
1054.09,"but, appropriately dosed, "
1055.94,"in an intermittent challenge type of scenario, "
1057.92,it can be good for us. 
1058.99,Is that how I should think about plants and these compounds? 
1061.38,Do you think of them as good for us or as bad for us? 
1065.24,"They're a very sharp blade, and we want to use them potently. "
1068.24,- I actually think that it's almost impossible. 
1072.15,"I mean, you'd have to eat nothing "
1075.16,"but the same plant all day, every day in large. "
1078.32,"The bioavailability of these compounds in the plants, "
1082.13,they're attached to a food matrix. 
1084.74,It's not like taking it in a supplement form as well. 
1089.36,It's such that it's very difficult to make it toxic. 
1094.69,"Now, there are some cases, "
1096.42,"for example, if you eat cabbage, "
1098.22,and I think there's some group in Africa or somewhere 
1100.36,"that that's all they eat is cabbage, "
1102.54,and there is a goitrogen in cabbage. 
1104.62,It's not sulforaphane. It's another compound. 
1106.86,"But that's all they eat, every day. Nothing but that. "
1109.597,- They get goiter. The thick neck. 
1111.06,"- Yeah, and they're iodine deficient on top of that. "
1113.33,"So I do think, "
1116.5,"you can, of course, make. "
1118.33,"I mean, there are types of plants that are toxic "
1120.41,"in small quantities, right? "
1121.982,- Hemlock. 
1122.94,"- [Rhonda] Hemlock, exactly. "
1123.773,- Will kill you. 
1124.606,"Folks, don't play this game with hemlock. "
1126.72,- But you're not going to get poisoned 
1128.57,"from eating your serving of broccoli at dinner, right? "
1133.41,"So, I mean, it depends on the plant. "
1137.26,"These generalizations are kind of, "
1139.46,"they're just not useful, "
1140.61,"and I think that a lot of people online in the blogosphere, "
1145.95,"they gravitate towards them because it's just easier, "
1148.42,and it's a lot more sensational. 
1150.82,"- I eat plants, meat, and starches. "
1152.32,I'm one of those rare omnivores out there now. 
1154.502,"- I do, too. "
1155.335,- I feel like it's rare to be an omnivore. 
1157.7,"But I think, once you step out of the social media, "
1160.14,"as you said, the blogosphere, "
1161.83,"most people, I would say, "
99%,of people on the planet 
1165.85,are probably omnivores. 
1167.501,- Right. 
1168.334,"- And someone will probably correct me, "
1169.18,but I doubt the number falls below 
98.,
1173.2,"- I think, if you look at data, "
1175.84,"and when we have carnivore data, I can't wait to see it, "
1179.803,"but, right now, it's a lot of, "
1181.86,"okay, well, this is a lot of anecdotal evidence, "
1184.94,"and there's a lot of good starts with anecdotes, "
1189.71,"but people change a thousand things at once, "
1191.75,"and they don't realize that, but they do. "
1195.1,"And so anecdotal data is only so good, right? "
1198.062,It's a starting point. 
1199.62,And so we don't really know long-term 
1202.25,what carnivore diets are going to do. 
1204.28,They may be beneficial short-term. 
1206.79,They may be beneficial for reasons 
1208.79,of elimination of other things. 
1210.08,"Who knows, right? Lots of possibilities. "
1212.07,"But I do think, with respect to plants, "
1215.61,"that there's so much evidence, "
1218.52,"like, for example, sulforaphane is one that I really like "
1221.84,because there's just evidence that sulforaphane 
1225.979,is a very powerful activator of the Nrf
2,pathway. 
1228.54,"And this is a pathway that regulates a lot of genes, "
1232.05,"a lot of genes that are related to glutathione production, "
1235.22,genes that are involved in detoxifying compounds 
1238.12,"that we're exposed to from our food, "
1239.46,like heterocyclic amines. 
1240.81,"In fact, there have been GWAS studies. "
1245.31,"These are studies that are genome-wide associated studies, "
1248.57,for people listening that aren't familiar. 
1251.06,"People have a variety of versions of genes, "
1254.21,and we have a gene that's able to make heterocyclic amines 
1259.78,to basically detoxify it so it's not as harmful. 
1263.87,And people that don't have a certain version of that 
1267.75,that's doing it well 
1269.02,"are very prone to colon cancer and increased cancer risk, "
1272.61,but if they eat a lot of broccoli 
1274.7,"and cruciferous vegetables, that negates that risk "
1276.84,"because they're getting sulforaphane, "
1278.9,which activates a lot of the glutathione transferase 
1283.773,and synthase genes. 
1284.85,"So glutathione's a major antioxidant in our brain, "
1288.136,"in our vascular system, in our body, basically. "
1291.63,So there's evidence that eating things like compounds 
1298.18,"that are like sulforaphane or broccoli or broccoli spouts, "
1301.68,which have up to 
100,times more sulforaphane 
1304.18,"than broccoli, are activating glutathione in the brain. "
1307.11,There's human evidence of that. 
1308.15,"I mean, that's amazing. "
1309.3,- [Andrew] That is amazing. - In Plasma. Yeah. 
1311.33,- Sorry to interrupt. I just want to make sure. 
1313.8,"So broccoli sprouts are different than broccoli, "
1316.1,and you just told us that they're much richer 
1320.13,in these compounds. 
1322.6,"So, note to self, I should have broccoli sprouts, "
1325.15,not just broccoli. 
1326.34,"Can we cook the broccoli and still get these nutrients, "
1328.57,or do we have to eat it raw? 
1329.403,"I confess, eating raw broccoli is really aversive to me. "
1333.53,- So the sulforaphane is formed 
1337.59,"from a compound called glucoraphanin, "
1339.65,"which is in the broccoli, "
1341.53,and the enzyme that converted into sulforaphane 
1343.94,"is myrosinase, and it's heat sensitive. "
1346.65,So you do somewhat lower the sulforaphane levels 
1349.974,when you cook the broccoli. 
1351.87,"However, there was a study a few years back "
1354.66,"that showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder, "
1357.75,"ground mustard seed powder, "
1359.77,"which also contains the myrosinase enzyme, "
1362.67,to your cooked broccoli 
1364.56,"increases the sulforaphane by fourfold, so... "
1368.4,"- This is great 'cause, I confess, "
1370.16,"I like broccoli if it's cooked to the appropriate density, "
1374.24,not too mushy but definitely not raw. 
1376.45,"The idea of eating raw broccoli to me just sounds horrible, "
1378.97,but I like the way mustard seed sounds. 
1381.19,So just a little bit of mustard seed powder 
1383.87,added to the cooked broccoli 
1385.15,can recover some of these compounds. 
1387.27,"- Yes, so what I do is I will lightly steam my broccoli, "
1391.65,"and then I add a little bit of my Kerrygold butter, "
1395.16,and then I add some mustard seed powder on the top of that. 
1398.48,And it's got a little kick. 
1400.137,It's just a little spice. 
1401.92,"And if you don't taste that, it's expired. "
1404.12,It should have a little kick. 
1405.66,- And because I know people will want to know 
1407.02,"how often and how much, "
1409.42,are you eating this every day or most days of the week? 
1413.01,"- Well, I had shifted to supplementation with sulforaphane. "
1420.13,I'm admitting right now that I've been terrible about it 
1422.09,"the past, I don't know, six months or so. "
1424.757,- The supplementation 
1425.69,"or the broccoli? - Yes, the supplementation. "
1429.356,And so there's another way to get. 
1432.62,"There's another compound, "
1433.91,and it's actually called moringa. 
1435.93,"And Dr. Jed Fahey, who's really the expert on sulforaphane. "
1441.45,He's a good friend of mine. 
1442.283,He's been on the podcast a couple of times. 
1446.295,"He basically thinks, "
1447.78,"and has done a lot of research on marina as well, "
1450.79,"that it's like the cousin, "
1452.26,and it activates the Nrf
2,pathways 
1454.73,similarly to sulforaphane. 
1456.77,And so I've been buying this Kuli Kuli moringa powder. 
1459.99,I don't have any affiliation with him. 
1461.08,- Kuli Kuli is a brand? - Kuli Kuli's the brand. 
1463.37,- That you have no affiliation to. 
1464.203,"- I have no affiliation, but Jed Fahey has researched it, "
1467.326,"like that specific brand, and so it's legit. "
1470.3,It's science backed 
1472.87,in terms of actually containing moringa and activating Nrf
2.,
1477.481,And I add it to my smoothies. 
1479.05,So that's what I've been doing. 
1481.51,- What are some dose ranges? 
1484.23,"And, of course, we give the usual recommendations "
1486.01,"that people should talk to their physician, "
1487.28,"et cetera, et cetera. "
1488.113,"But, if people are going to, what do you take? "
1491.44,That's always the... 
1492.273,"- A big, heaping tablespoon. - Let's take "
1494.23,"the David Sinclairian approach, "
1496.32,"where he'll talk about what he does, "
1498.39,as a way to deal with this. 
1499.7,"Of course, everybody's different "
1500.84,"and should, in all seriousness, "
1503.792,anytime you add or delete something from your consumption 
1507.26,"should consult some trusted healthcare professional, "
1510.73,trusted by you. 
1512.73,Do you recall the dosages? 
1514.21,"- I do a big, heaping tablespoon. "
1516.74,- So Kuli Kuli moringa. It sounds like a song. 
1519.87,"- It's with a K. I know, it does. "
1523.43,"But, for people also listening, "
1525.73,"it's like, ""Well, why would I do that?"" "
1526.84,I mentioned the glutathione in the brain. 
1528.44,I mentioned it in plasma. 
1530.87,"It's been shown to lower DNA damage in people, "
1533.49,in white blood cells. 
1536.53,There's been several different studies in China. 
1539.01,"In China, there's a lot of air pollution. "
1540.52,And I mentioned that it's a very powerful activator of Nrf
2.,
1543.86,And I know you're familiar with Nrf
2.,
1545.7,Nrf
2,"is a transcription factor that is, "
1549.06,it is binding to a little specific sequence 
1552.46,"in a variety of different genes, and it's turning them on, "
1555.52,"or, in some cases, turning them off. "
1557.18,It's regulating what's being activated 
1559.14,"or what's not being activated, being turned off. "
1561.45,And some of the genes are basically 
1564.68,these detoxifying pathways. 
1566.12,"We talked a little bit about the glutathione, "
1567.507,but there's also ones that are involved 
1569.16,"in airborne carcinogens, like benzene. "
1573.36,So benzene's found in air pollution. 
1575.19,"I mean, cigarette smoke. "
1577.37,"If you're smoking cigarettes still, please try to quit. "
1579.707,"- Yeah, you're mutating your DNA. "
1581.145,"- [Rhonda] Yeah, it's the worst. "
1582.14,"- To say nothing of the lung cancer, "
1583.16,you're mutating your DNA. 
1584.29,- And heart disease risk. Heart disease risk. 
1586.15,"But, anyways. "
1587.98,"People, and this has been repeated in more than one study, "
1591.17,that literally after 
24,"hours of taking, "
1593.77,I can't remember off the top of my head 
1595.33,"what the dose of sulforaphane from broccoli extract, "
1599.36,"broccoli seed extract was, "
1602.17,"or broccoli sprouts extract, not the seed. "
1604.97,It was the sprouts. 
1606.52,"Anyways, they started excreting "
60%,benzene and acrolein. 
1610.132,That's something that we get in cooked food. 
1611.59,- It's coming out in their urine? 
1612.43,- Coming out in their urine. Yeah. 
1614.536,"- Well, I'm not a smoker, and I have to be honest. "
1616.64,It's rare that I hear of a supplement for the first time 
1619.48,'cause I've been deep-diving on supplements 
1622.76,since I was in my teens. 
1624.49,"This is fascinating, "
1625.98,"and it brings back to this question that we had before, "
1629.01,and I appreciate that you've answered it very clearly. 
1632.31,Plants have compounds that are good for us. 
1634.14,They're not just stressing us. 
1635.41,They're activating pathways that are reparative. 
1638.509,That's what I'm taking away 
1639.93,from everything you're telling me. 
1641.667,"- Right, and that our bodies, "
1644.86,we're supposed to be getting that stress 
1647.59,to have those pathways activated. 
1651.26,"You know, right? "
1652.093,"I mean, this is conserved among different animals. "
1655.5,"This is something that is, "
1658.52,it's supposed to happen. 
1659.59,"And, in our modern day world, we don't have to eat plants. "
1665.3,We don't have to move anywhere or exercise. 
1668.04,We don't have to go through periods of not eating food 
1670.13,because we can have it at our fingertips 
1671.47,"at any second, right? "
1672.99,"So, I mean, we've got this conundrum of, "
1677.12,we're never activating these stress response pathways 
1679.36,that we're supposed to activate. 
1681.26,We're supposed to. 
1682.12,"- I find that fascinating, and again, "
1684.46,"drawing a parallel to the nervous system, "
1687.22,"so what I'm hearing you say is that, historically, "
1690.43,"we would have to go through some stress, "
1692.16,"some confront cold or confront heat, "
1694.21,"or confront effort or hunger, "
1697.6,"have to exercise, essentially, "
1698.97,"in order to obtain these compounds, "
1700.89,and then those compounds are reparative. 
1702.82,"Yeah, I feel that resembles the dopamine pathway. "
1707.29,I always say there's nothing wrong with dopamine. 
1709.15,People think about dopamine hits as bad or dopamine is bad. 
1711.71,There's absolutely nothing wrong with dopamine. 
1713.75,"The problem is dopamine, especially high levels of dopamine, "
1718.3,released without the need for effort to access that dopamine 
1721.85,is problematic. 
1722.96,So a line of cocaine gives you a ton of dopamine 
1725.26,"with no effort except to ingest the drug, "
1727.54,whereas working for four years or more to get your degree 
1731.49,will release a lot of dopamine 
1733.26,"and a lot of cortisol along the way, as we know, "
1736.28,"and it's considered a healthy accomplishment in most cases, "
1739.94,a tremendous amount. 
1741.67,"We're approaching the spring, "
1742.89,and there'll be a lot of graduations. 
1744.19,Weddings are coming up now that the pandemic 
1746.07,is hopefully slowing. 
1748.14,And there'll be a lot of dopamine. 
1749.53,"High levels of dopamine are great, "
1750.86,but only after the effort of having done something 
1754.01,in order to access it. 
1754.843,And so that's what I'm taking away from what you're saying 
1757.11,"is that we need to go through this intermittent, "
1760.39,"different types of intermittent challenge, "
1762.19,and we are rewarded with particular compounds 
1766.47,"that are reparative, both for the challenge, "
1768.42,but then make us stronger. 
1770.11,"Hormesis really is, it seems, "
1771.26,"a case of what doesn't kill us, makes us stronger. "
1775.03,So you mentioned- 
1775.87,- Can I add to that 
1776.774,"one thing you just said? - [Andrew] Please, please. "
1777.857,- Because this has been shown 
1779.84,"with, for example, sulforaphane in animal studies, "
1782.4,"you precondition, give the animal sulforaphane, "
1784.99,and then you expose them to hypoxia 
1787.47,"or some kind of ischemic stroke condition, "
1790.09,"whatever they do to induce that, "
1791.63,"and the sulforaphane, it basically protects them. "
1795.88,Their precondition 
1796.92,"and their stress response pathways are primed, "
1800.01,"and so, when they're then exposed to the ischemic stroke, "
1803.71,"their outcomes are so much better, so much better "
1806.68,than the animals that didn't get the sulforaphane 
1808.7,
48,hours before or whatever it was. 
1810.631,And this has been shown in multiple animal studies 
1813.43,with sulforaphane specifically in the brain. 
1815.87,I know Mark Mattson. Dr Mark Mattson. 
1818.11,"He's often thought of as the intermittent fasting king, "
1821.88,"but he's a neuroscientist, "
1823.798,and he did publish some work 
1826.06,and talks about sulforaphane as well. 
1827.95,"- I'm really glad you brought that up, that example up, "
1830.97,because many of the questions I get on social media 
1834.12,and elsewhere are about traumatic brain injury. 
1836.73,And TBI is just one example. 
1840.8,"And people always think, ""Oh, sports. It's football."" "
1843.01,"Whenever you say TBI, people always think football. "
1844.88,And I just want to just take a moment to editorialize. 
1848.83,
90%,or more of traumatic brain injury 
1851.27,"is construction work, at-home accidents. "
1855.0,"Football players, hockey players, martial artists "
1858.23,are a tiny fraction of the people who have TBI 
1861.55,and concussion of various kinds. 
1863.07,"It just so happens that, within those communities, "
1865.27,"many of them, "
75%,"or more, experience those. "
1868.07,"So it's salient within those communities, "
1869.73,but concussion is prominent. 
1872.28,"People are always asking, ""What can I do "
1874.447,"""in order to offset brain injury? "
1876.977,"""I had a concussion two years ago. What can I do?"" "
1879.1,And it's been a tough question 
1881.09,because we really don't have anything for them. 
1883.27,"I mean, you tell them sleep well, eat well, exercise, "
1887.01,but it sounds like some of these reparative pathways 
1890.21,either should be explored in the context of brain injury 
1893.27,"or, I'm guessing, are being explored "
1895.04,in the context of brain injury. 
1896.15,"- Yeah, so a couple of things there. "
1898.217,"One is that, I mean, traumatic brain injury, "
1901.47,"it's terrible, but it's so interesting "
1904.24,"because it's also like literal, real-time brain aging. "
1910.12,You're able to accelerate it and understand. 
1912.63,"So I often think of, when I think of traumatic brain injury, "
1916.17,I think of so much overlap between Alzheimer's disease 
1918.727,and dementia and these neurodegenerative diseases 
1921.0,because there are a lot of similarities there. 
1924.38,"And so, sulforaphane, I personally think, "
1927.56,and I do think there's been some animal research 
1930.11,"with TBI and sulforaphane, "
1933.74,mostly preconditioning rather than treatment. 
1937.54,"So, again, it's like, well, "
1939.56,if you want a healthy lifestyle thing 
1941.66,"and you're a construction worker, "
1942.88,"or you're fill in the blank, that's going to. "
1945.24,"I mean, anyone that drives a car, "
1946.487,"you're at risk to some degree, right? "
1948.16,"- [Andrew] Or bicycle. - Bicycle, yeah. "
1949.81,"- Around Stanford, I would say people demonize motorcycles, "
1954.37,"people demonize a lot of things, "
1955.9,but moving fast through space on a small object 
1959.77,next to a 
"3,",
000,"pound vehicle, "
1962.27,"I mean, we have a number of friends that have died. "
1964.56,We have a number of people with traumatic brain injury. 
1966.71,"I'm not against cycling or cyclists, "
1968.15,but it's a risky sport by any stretch. 
1973.68,"So, in taking things like moringa "
1976.74,"or eating my broccoli sprouts, "
1979.19,maybe cooking them a little less 
1980.32,"than I'm currently cooking them, "
1981.33,putting on the mustard seed. 
1984.33,Is there evidence that? 
1985.93,"Well, first of all, Nrf"
2,"is expressed in neurons, "
1989.04,so those cells should be protected. 
1991.03,Are there other cells of the body 
1992.42,that could possibly gain protection from these pathways? 
1995.92,"- Well, lungs for one, but just even in plasma cells. "
2001.13,I think Nrf
2,is pretty ubiquitously expressed. 
2005.88,Liver. 
2007.786,There's so many animal studies 
2009.65,that have looked at all those things. 
2010.6,I try to kind of gravitate towards human ones 
2012.61,'cause it's a lot more relevant. 
2015.3,"But I think, overall, like I mentioned, "
2018.57,DNA damage lower. 
2019.87,It was like 
24,or 
34%,lower in human blood cells 
2024.93,after broccoli sprout powder supplementation. 
2028.85,- [Andrew] Wow. 
2029.683,"- And I made a video on this years ago, "
2016,"maybe, "
2033.14,and I think I have the references on there to exact amounts. 
2036.12,I can't remember. - We can link to the video. 
2037.67,- But it's kind of an old video. It's 
2016.,
2040.37,"But I also had Jed on the podcast, "
2042.62,and he did talk about this. 
2044.37,But it's also been shown in randomized controlled trials 
2047.05,to help treat autism and autistic symptoms. 
2049.64,"Yet again, it's doing interesting things in the brain, "
2052.38,and I think it does have something to do 
2055.9,"with the oxidative stress, the glutathione, "
2058.14,which would be relevant for TBI treatment. 
2061.67,It hasn't been shown empirically 
2063.523,"that that helps with treatment, "
2065.21,but I do think someone could do that study. 
2069.33,"I think that it should be done, honestly, "
2071.81,"because it's a low-hanging fruit, "
2073.23,"I mean, if there's any impact. "
2074.84,And there is at least one preliminary study 
2076.893,that glutathione is increased in the brain 
2079.06,after humans are basically taking sulforaphane. 
2083.58,"- Which is, really, for people listening, "
2085.16,that's so important because a number of compounds 
2087.31,that people take in supplement form 
2089.06,"don't cross the blood-brain barrier, "
2090.91,or they get metabolized in ways 
2092.6,that what's listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant 
2095.23,for what your cells actually experience. 
2097.41,So that's very reassuring. 
2099.43,We will get back to heat and cold 
2100.557,"and this theme that I tried to surface, "
2102.41,but I just find this too interesting 
2103.82,to diverge at this point from these themes. 
2108.4,"So, what other compounds or micronutrients "
2111.75,"do you place in the top tier of useful, interesting? "
2117.7,There are animal studies. 
2118.71,Maybe there are hopefully also some human studies. 
2121.15,We've talked about a few. 
2122.7,I know you've talked a lot about omega-
3,fatty acids. 
2125.19,"So, if you had to do your top three, "
2128.74,"your superstars of nutrients for the brain and body, "
2132.77,"sounds like we've got one set, "
2135.06,what would you put alongside them? 
2137.3,- Omega-
"3,",the marine omega-
3,fatty acids. 
2140.44,"So these are found in marine types of animals, "
2145.47,"fish, cold water fish, fatty fish. "
2147.76,So there's three fatty acids. 
2149.96,"There's one from a plant, "
2151.79,"and that's often referred to as ALA, people call it short, "
2155.05,"alpha-linolenic acid, "
2156.52,"and then there's eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, "
2159.77,"and docosahexaenoic acid, which is DHA. "
2162.32,"Yeah, but EPA- - I'm amazed you can pronounce "
2163.83,two of the most difficult words to pronounce and spell 
2167.92,"right next to ophthalmology, "
2169.19,"which, if you can spell it. "
2170.63,I know people who have appointments 
2172.24,in ophthalmology departments 
2173.48,that don't know how to spell ophthalmology. 
2175.65,Little secret. There's an extra P in there. 
2178.57,So the ALA. 
2181.09,I'm not going to attempt to pronounce it 
2183.04,because your pronunciation was perfect 
2184.56,of both of these two compounds. 
2186.4,"And you said are marine sources, so fish, "
2188.93,"so sardines, cod, this sort of thing, but what about krill? "
2191.93,I've seen krill oil. 
2193.62,"A few years back, people were saying krill "
2195.92,is a better source for omega-
3s,than is fish oil. 
2201.35,"I took some krill oil capsules, "
2204.41,"made me itch all over, so I stopped. "
2207.06,- Do you have a shellfish allergy? 
2208.28,"- No, I don't think so. - No, okay. "
2209.692,- I don't think so. 
2210.525,"I'm not a big fan of shellfish, "
2211.358,"but I'll have oysters every now and again, "
2213.21,"or shrimp or something, and feel fine. "
2215.78,"- Yeah, we can talk about sources. "
2217.04,So krill is a source 
2221.6,mostly of a type of DHA and EPA 
2225.46,that's in phospholipid form. 
2227.32,So it's a phosphatidylcholine omega-
3,"fatty acid, "
2231.21,"and that's different than most of the, "
2235.56,"well, if we're talking about fish oil supplements, "
2237.8,"that's a different story, "
2238.633,but if you're talking about comparing fish 
2240.48,"to eating krill, like we're talking about the food. "
2242.44,"- Oh, I would never eat krill. "
2243.46,- Okay. Are we talking about the supplements? 
2245.21,"- Yes, I apologize. - Fish oil supplements. "
2246.043,"- Yeah, krill supplement versus fish oil supplement, "
2250.42,"and, if it fits in the conversation, "
2253.61,talking about great sources of omega-
3s,in their whole form. 
2257.944,I have a bad feeling you're going to tell me sardines. 
2261.51,"- Sardines are, yeah, they're awesome. Anyways. "
2263.821,- Except for the taste. 
2265.35,- And for the potential contaminants. 
2269.19,"Mercury, I think, was one. "
2271.067,"No. Yeah, it was mercury. "
2272.82,"And Joe was telling me about, "
2275.56,he used to eat sardines everyday. 
2276.71,Joe Rogan was telling me 
2277.925,"that he used to eat sardines every day, "
2279.69,and then he had really high mercury levels. 
2282.187,And I was really shocked because sardines are low 
2286.49,in the fish groups. 
2290.42,"The higher up you get, like swordfish and sharks, "
2292.52,"like, really high mercury "
2293.68,"'cause they're eating all the other fish, right? "
2296.18,"But I think some brands, "
2298.39,and if you look at ConsumerLab. 
2300.81,"ConsumerLab, it's like a third-party site "
2303.16,"that I'm not affiliated with, "
2304.62,but I'll use them because they do a lot of analysis 
2307.83,of different foods and supplements. 
2310.2,"And so you can look at some of their sardines, "
2312.69,and they have a list of ones that are pretty decent. 
2315.56,"But, anyways, back to your question "
2317.75,about fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements. 
2321.34,So one of the major differences 
2324.1,"is that fish oil supplements, "
2326.16,"if you get a high quality one, it's in a triglyceride form. "
2330.17,So you've got a glycerol backbone 
2333.4,"with three fatty acids that's attached, "
2336.12,and those are either DHA or the EPA. 
2340.44,"Or, if you have a lower quality fish oil supplement, "
2343.03,then you have what's called ethyl ester form. 
2345.81,"And, typically, the reason for that, "
2348.49,"when fish oil is purified, "
2350.75,it's run through this column with alcohol or something. 
2353.78,"They cleave it off, the glycerol backbone, "
2355.66,and then it's just kind of easier to leave it like that 
2357.97,"than re-esterifying it, which costs more money. "
2360.58,"So you can get it in ethyl ester form, "
2362.58,which isn't as bioavailable. 
2365.55,"And, in fact, if you don't take it with food, "
2368.16,you're going to be in trouble. 
2369.559,You're not going to absorb much of it at all. 
2371.947,- Would you see this on the packaging? 
2373.484,Is it going to say it's in this ethyl form? 
2376.11,"- Some official brands will put it on their website, "
2380.12,"perhaps on their packaging, "
2381.36,"but, most of the time, you'll have to dig for it "
2383.73,on the website and/or call them. 
2386.51,"But I think, for the most part, "
2388.21,"ones that are higher end will market it, "
2390.64,like triglyceride form. 
2391.87,And it's not that ethyl ester's bad. 
2393.42,It just means take it with food. 
2395.743,So one of the major prescription omega-
3s,"out there is, "
2400.14,"both of them actually, Lovaza, "
2402.256,"which is a mixture of DHA and EPA, "
2404.67,"as well as Vascepa, which is a highly purified EPA. "
2407.31,These are both prescribed by physicians 
2409.64,"to patients with hypertriglyceridemia, "
2412.16,"so high triglycerides among other things, "
2414.93,I think maybe dysregulation of lipids as well. 
2418.133,- This is amazing. 
2419.49,"For people, so these are prescription drugs "
2422.12,"that are essentially very high-potency, purified omega-"
"3s,",
2425.51,but they're given to people for lipid issues. 
2427.91,So this is the treatment of issues with fat metabolism 
2431.1,by giving people fat. 
2432.38,- Yes. 
2433.522,"- I just want to push home, "
2435.21,"again, I'm not carnivore keto or anything, I'm an omnivore, "
2437.5,but to just push home that one thing that's so wonderful 
2442.78,that you've done over the years and you continue to do 
2444.87,"is to move away from these very broad, sweeping statements "
2449.94,about fat is bad. 
2451.37,"Here's a case where we're saying fat is not only good, "
2454.16,it can be used to combat issues with fat metabolism. 
2457.976,And fats are not just one thing. They're many things. 
2462.1,"So anyway, I just want to put a little highlighter "
2464.2,and a point of appreciation there 
2465.71,"and make sure that people are sensitized to the fact that, "
2470.07,"if you hear that fat is bad, "
2471.54,"you have to ask, what kind of fat? "
2473.087,And here we're talking about these omega-
3s.,
2475.42,"Okay, so the triglyceride form "
2477.26,"can be taken with or without food, "
2480.37,and there's prescription forms. 
2484.27,I don't know if I can get ahold 
2485.127,of the prescription form unless- 
2487.38,- You have high triglycerides. 
2488.6,- Or I have a friend with high triglycerides. 
2490.17,"No. It's illegal, folks. "
2491.39,Don't share prescription drugs. 
2493.28,"- Or you talk to your doctor and you say, "
2494.517,"""I'm already taking this from..."" "
2496.6,"I mean, I don't know how it works. Anyways. "
2497.9,- What's the dosage that you recommend people get? 
2501.55,One way or another. 
2502.79,"- All right, okay, so the dosage that physicians prescribe "
2506.06,"for high triglycerides, for example, is four grams a day. "
2509.94,- Four grams of EPA. 
2512.25,"- Yes, of the Vascepa. "
2514.773,I think Lovaza's also prescribed at four grams a day. 
2518.19,And you can get either of those from your physician. 
2521.75,My father-in-law just got one of 'em prescribed. 
2523.368,We were buying our own omega-
3,for years and years. 
2525.59,"It's like, hey, you can actually get this "
2526.97,and health insurance can cover it. 
2528.517,"And it's a really purified form, "
2529.91,but you have to take it with food. That was the bottom line. 
2533.01,"I've totally gone on tangents, "
2534.53,but you're asking more interesting questions anyway. 
2536.86,"- Well, normally I ask about mechanism "
2538.01,"and then I talk about protocols, but in the- "
2540.99,- Or the why. 
2541.83,- [Andrew] Or the why. 
2542.99,"- I mean, we haven't gotten there yet. "
2544.565,"- And we definitely will get there, "
2545.94,but I think a number of people nowadays 
2547.8,are just really excited about what they can do 
2550.6,"for their health, and so, here, "
2552.67,we're just raising the importance of omega-
"3s,",
2554.53,and then we'll definitely get to the why 
2555.72,"and the underlying mechanism. - Yeah, I think four grams is, "
2559.138,"I mean, in fact, "
2562.21,"Bill Harris, Dr. Bill Harris, "
2564.68,he's just one of the pioneers 
2566.25,on omega-
3,fatty acid research. 
2567.87,He was on our podcast last August. 
2571.29,And he was saying the reason FDA chose that was literally 
2575.09,just because how much they could get people to take. 
2578.485,"It wasn't like an upper end, "
2580.59,like anything above that is unsafe. 
2582.86,That wasn't the case. 
2584.37,"I mean, it was just purely cost "
2587.61,"and compliance, "
2591.09,"so what they can get into a pill, the amount they can get, "
2593.627,and how many pills they can get people to take. 
2595.95,- I'm smiling because our good friend Satchin Panda 
2599.15,"at the Salk Institute, "
2600.55,who's done a lot of important work on intermittent fasting 
2602.72,"and other incredible work on circadian rhythms, et cetera. "
2606.71,When I was talking to him 
2608.42,"in preparation for an episode on intermittent fasting, "
2611.15,"I said, ""Why the eight-hour feeding window?"" "
2613.38,"And he said, ""Well, the graduate student "
2614.887,"""who ran those studies had a partner."" "
2617.24,"I think it was a girlfriend, as I recall. "
2618.89,Hope I didn't get that backward. 
2620.26,"And the partner said, ""Listen, you can be in lab "
2624.857,""""
10,"hours a day, but you can't be in lab "
14,hours a day 
2627.377,"""if you want this relationship to work."" "
2629.21,"And so it was eight hours of feeding window, "
2630.94,"plus some measurements and time to walk into the lab, "
2633.58,"park the car, et cetera. "
2634.78,And so the eight-hour feeding window 
2636.09,that everyone holds so holy 
2637.84,was actually just born out of this relationship 
2640.58,between these two graduate students. 
2642.0,"Had they been single, "
2643.59,"I was single all through graduate school, "
2645.42,"or most of it anyway, and I lived in the lab. "
2647.74,"So, if it'd been me, intermittent fasting "
2650.01,would mean eating 
14,hours a day. 
2651.8,That was a joke. 
2652.73,"Not a good one, but just want to make clear. I'm joking. "
2655.31,"But the point that you're making is a really good one, "
2657.2,that the four gram amount 
2661.48,is not a threshold based on anything 
2664.06,except the threshold of people's willingness 
2666.12,to actually take this stuff. 
2668.986,And I think that's important for people to hear. 
2670.94,"Because so often we hear the eight-hour feeding window, "
2673.24,"four grams of EPA, "
150,"minutes of cardio, "
2677.53,and it's really a question of what you can reasonably do 
2680.21,in a study. 
2681.043,- So I take four grams a day. 
2682.91,"I take two in the morning, two grams in the morning, "
2684.91,and I take two grams in the evening. 
2686.3,"I take my EPA in the morning, "
2687.97,and I take my DHA in the evening. 
2689.88,- You split them. 
2690.76,- I do. 
2692.22,I don't know. 
2693.49,"I don't think it's necessary, necessarily. "
2696.01,I just happen to get a certain fish oil supplement 
2699.1,that separates them. 
2701.33,"And so, like Lovaza, Lovaza's a great one, "
2703.507,"and it's all in one, and it's easier. "
2705.52,- What if someone doesn't have a prescription? 
2707.03,So I take over-the-counter fish oil. 
2709.72,I know I feel better 
2710.94,'cause I've done the experiment of going on and off. 
2712.64,"I take them mainly for, "
2713.99,"I don't have depression, but my mood is better. "
2718.13,My joints feel better. I just feel better. 
2721.47,"And I like to think that my platelets are slipperier, "
2723.668,and they're cruising through any little obstructions 
2727.76,in my veins or arteries. 
2729.01,"That's the image I have in my head, "
2730.36,but I don't have any data to support that part. 
2732.48,"- Yeah, I mean, so, if you're asking for, like, "
2735.28,where do people get these fish oil supplements? 
2736.75,"- Let's say I look at the bottle, "
2738.45,"and it says two grams per serving, "
2741.81,"but then I look, and it's "
750,milligrams of EPA 
2748.11,or 
"1,",
000,milligrams of EPA. 
2749.66,Let's say half of it is EPA. 
2750.82,"Then, do I want to hit a threshold of EPA "
2753.82,"or a threshold of what's listed on the bottle, "
2758.825,on the front of the bottle? 
2760.95,Because my understanding 
2762.1,is that we need to hit a threshold level of EPA 
2765.27,in order to derive these important benefits. 
2768.31,- I think two grams is a good threshold. 
2771.49,"Now, the International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO, "
2777.21,they have a website where they do third-party testing 
2780.27,of a ton of different fish oil supplements 
2783.89,"from around the world, and they measure the concentration "
2787.62,of the omega-
3,"fatty acids in the actual supplement, "
2790.51,"because nothing is ever what it says on the bottle, "
2793.83,"and then they also measure contaminants, "
2796.67,"so mercury, PCBs, dioxins, "
2799.01,things that you'd find potentially in fish 
2801.4,"that are harmful to humans, "
2803.03,and they also measure mercury and then oxidized fatty acids. 
2807.62,So these omega-
3,fatty acids 
2809.54,"are polyunsaturated fatty acids, "
2811.78,which are extremely prone to oxidation. 
2814.4,So please keep your fish oil in the refrigerator 
2817.42,because it's colder. 
2818.45,"Yeah, they're extremely prone. - Mine's in the cupboard, "
2820.5,so now I know. 
2821.376,- The shelf life's increased. Lower oxidation. 
2825.59,"- No, it makes perfect sense. Yeah. "
2827.73,"- So, anyways, they measure that. "
2830.45,"And I typically like to look for, "
2832.21,they give you a total oxidation number. 
2833.96,It's called T-O-T-O-X. 
2837.26,TOTOX is what we call it for short. 
2839.24,And I like it to be at the least under 
"10,",
2842.69,ideally under six. 
2843.58,"It's really hard to find all the right mixtures of things, "
2846.83,"but people can go to this website, "
2850.1,and they can browse through the products. 
2851.72,"I've put together an Excel sheet, "
2854.36,which I have a YouTube little screencast 
2857.66,"that I'm yet to publish, press the publish button on, "
2860.03,"but it, basically, "
2861.13,you have to go back and check and update 
2862.54,'cause these are from different lot numbers of the products. 
2865.89,They do have up to like 
"20,",
27,or something. 
2868.767,And so I've gone through and found my top picks 
2871.74,of high EPA brands and high DHA brands. 
2874.58,"If I were to buy some, the ones that I would choose "
2877.38,because of the low total oxidation 
2879.85,and the high concentration of either EPA or DHA. 
2882.38,"Now, people can go and do this themselves. "
2885.24,It just takes some work. 
2886.257,"- No, I'm glad that you did the work. "
2888.12,I'm going to put up a tweet every week. 
2891.23,- Oh no! 
2892.22,- With you tagged until this list is published online. 
2895.18,"Sorry, Rhonda, but I'm going to do it. "
2896.98,"I know it's very sadistic of me, "
2898.38,but in service to the community 
2900.01,"and myself. - Yes, "
2901.017,"and I chose five brands from each, "
2902.47,and I tried to find one in Europe 
2904.78,and one in Canada. - Great. 
2905.752,- So there's a great selection 
2906.76,of US and other. - Thank you 
2907.67,for doing that work. 
2908.6,"I don't want to do that work, and I trust you. "
2911.25,"So, yeah, I try and get two grams per day of EPA "
2915.04,from supplementation. 
2916.19,I'll now put it in the refrigerator. 
2918.01,Mood is better. 
2919.14,I made that decision mainly based on the data 
2922.0,"that I'm aware of, "
2923.97,looking at comparison of people doing that 
2926.83,anywhere from two to four grams of EPA per day 
2928.8,"compared to SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, "
2934.099,"in treatment of depression, "
2935.7,"and I don't want to take an SSRI if I don't have to, "
2937.94,"and fortunately, I don't have to, "
2939.21,"but the data, by my read, are remarkable. "
2942.16,"People that take these things in sufficient doses, "
2944.45,"meaning the EPAs, "
2946.29,are able to get by with much lower dosages 
2948.85,of SSRIs for depression relief 
2951.51,"or, in some cases, to come off their SSRIs completely "
2955.27,or avoid going on antidepressant medication. 
2958.11,"Now, of course, this is not something people should cowboy. "
2960.48,Mental health issues are serious. 
2962.13,"But what other reasons, "
2965.91,"I'd love your thoughts on that, on the mental health part, "
2968.27,so maybe you could tell us what are some things 
2970.48,that getting to two to four grams of EPA per day 
2973.07,is going to help with in our brain and the rest of our body. 
2976.127,"- So, do you know? "
2977.92,So I actually published a paper back in 
2015,
2981.42,about the role of omega-
3,"and vitamin D in depression, "
2985.39,"bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior. "
2989.61,"But, so, within that paper, "
2993.97,"doing background research, "
2995.186,"and this was a review article, by the way, "
2996.24,I was just connecting dots 'cause I love doing that. 
2998.06,- I'm going to grab that paper. 
2999.068,"I confess, I don't know the paper, "
3000.55,but I love quality reviews 
3003.45,because the references they're in are so useful. 
3006.12,"- Well, there's a huge role for inflammation, "
3009.59,the cause of inflammation in depression. 
3011.57,"And I think we did a short animated video on this as well, "
3015.05,"years ago, back when I was publishing that work, "
3018.23,where people are injected with lipopolysaccharide. 
3022.48,"This is something that we're generating from our gut, "
3026.06,"mostly from our gut permeability, which happens a lot. "
3030.701,"Endotoxin, it's also called. "
3032.703,It's endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. 
3034.179,It's basically the outer membrane of bacterial cells 
3037.03,"when bacteria die, so like when the immune cells in our gut "
3040.2,come into contact with the bacteria 
3042.15,"because we drank alcohol five days in a row or whatever, "
3047.29,"we release endotoxin, or something stressed us out. "
3049.89,"We release endotoxin into our body, "
3051.61,and that causes inflammation. 
3053.127,And so you can inject people with lipopolysaccharide 
3056.75,and cause depressive symptoms. 
3058.77,"However, if you take those same cohort of people, "
3061.64,"give them EPA, "
3062.74,"and I think it was somewhere around two grams, "
3064.82,and then inject them with lipopolysaccharide. 
3066.59,"We're establishing causation here, right? "
3069.0,"It totally, the depressive symptoms, versus a placebo. "
3071.44,So the placebo was saline control. 
3073.46,So this was a placebo controlled 
3074.98,because obviously it's hugely important for depression. 
3078.0,It ameliorated the depressive symptoms 
3080.08,that was caused by lipopolysaccharide. 
3081.8,"- Amazing, and LPS, lipopolysaccharide, is no joke. "
3085.83,"Years ago, when I was working on thermal regulation, "
3089.88,we would inject animals with LPS to induce fever. 
3094.317,The vagus nerve registers the presence of LPS signals 
3097.56,to these particular hyperglycemic areas 
3100.56,and cranks up body temperature 
3101.79,"because, basically, it's a signal that the body is infected. "
3106.45,Amazing. 
3107.71,So I will continue with my two grams per day. 
3110.99,Maybe I'll ramp it up to four. 
3112.44,I'm not doing the DHA separately. 
3115.65,There's DHA 
3116.483,in the same supplement. - Yes. 
3117.983,- [Andrew] Is that okay? 
3118.97,"- Yes. Yeah, yeah. "
3119.97,And to kind of... 
3122.07,"Boy, we've got a lot of things to hit back on "
3124.05,because one of your original questions 
3126.0,was krill oil versus fish oil. 
3128.023,"- Yes, still in the cue. "
3129.68,"- DHA, specifically, "
3133.74,"in phospholipid form, it's more bioavailable. "
3137.73,"So, if you're comparing exact quantity or concentration "
3143.41,"in triglyceride form versus phospholipid form, "
3147.07,"you will get more in your plasma cells, "
3150.38,"in your plasma, plasma cell, "
3151.343,in your plasma with krill oil. 
3154.24,"However, krill oil supplements are so low dose. "
3159.62,"I mean, good luck getting two grams "
3163.41,of omega-
3,from krill oil. 
3165.55,"And also, krill oil supplements are notoriously rancid. "
3169.12,I don't know for whatever reason. 
3170.16,- Maybe that's what made me itchy all over. 
3172.557,- I think they're just... 
3174.48,I haven't found a good krill oil supplement. 
3177.88,I pretty much stay away from it. 
3178.723,"I mean, if you smell it too, "
3180.46,"I mean, it just smells rancid. "
3184.94,"So, but the thing is, "
3185.773,and I also published a paper on this back in 
"2019,",
3191.42,"yeah, something like that, "
3193.56,about DHA in phospholipid form getting into the brain 
3199.643,through a different mechanism than DHA in triglyceride form. 
3202.17,And so it's going through a transporter 
3204.2,called the MFSD
2A,transporter. 
3206.09,And I think it's very relevant for people 
3207.42,with an APOE
4,"allele, so- "
3210.22,- People with an Alzheimer's susceptibility. 
3212.13,"- Right, so like "
25%,of the population has an allele 
3216.14,and a gene called APOE
"4,",
3218.731,"and, basically, it's APOE, but the four is referred to "
3223.73,as the bad kind of version of it. 
3226.97,This is something in our bodies. It's also in our brain. 
3229.8,"And if people have one of these versions, "
3232.19,"if they got one from their mom or their dad, "
3233.88,they have a twofold increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. 
3236.22,"If they get two, which is much more, "
3239.577,it's less common. 
3240.79,I think it's like 
2%,of the population or something 
3242.637,"has two alleles, but they have like a "
10,
3244.437,or 
11-fold,increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. 
3246.78,"So there is a role for phospholipid form DHA in the brain, "
3251.47,but you also make phospholipid DHA inside your body. 
3253.66,And you can do that by taking in more triglyceride forms. 
3256.91,"So two grams or more is the magic number, I think. "
3264.185,So kind of back to the why for fish oil. 
3267.85,"I personally think it is one of the most powerful, "
3272.24,"anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, "
3276.41,"things that we can get easily, relatively easily, "
3280.96,"that is going to powerfully modulate the way you think, "
3285.43,"the way you feel, and the way you age. "
3288.33,And a variety of different types of studies 
3292.523,"kind of led me to that conclusion, "
3294.65,a variety of observational studies. 
3297.28,So there's been lots of work by Dr. Bill Harris 
3299.38,"and his collaborators looking at, "
3301.86,it's called the Omega-
3,Index. 
3303.84,So this is actually the omega-
3,level in red blood cells. 
3307.86,So red blood cells turn over about every 
120,days. 
3310.9,So it's a long-term marker of omega-
3,status. 
3314.1,This is very different from 
99.9%,of any study you see 
3319.57,or any lab that you go to to get your omega-
3,levels tested. 
3323.32,"You're getting your plasma phospholipid levels tested, "
3325.92,"which is kind of like you can think of it as, "
3328.47,what did I eat a couple days before? 
3330.09,"Oh, I had fish. My omega-"
3,levels are great. 
3333.24,"But did you eat fish like that every week, "
3336.06,or was it like you went out to dinner? 
3338.71,So it's not a great biomarker for long-term omega-
3,status. 
3344.12,It's kind of like the fasting blood glucose levels 
3347.64,versus the HbA
"1c,",which is like a long-term marker 
3350.543,of your blood glucose levels. 
3352.28,So the Omega-
3,Index. 
3353.87,"He's done a variety of studies, observational studies. "
3356.78,"So, for people listening, "
3357.64,these are studies that are obviously flawed 
3360.43,because they're not establishing causality. 
3364.33,You're looking at people's lifestyles. 
3368.06,"But, in the case of Bill Harris's work, "
3370.64,he's measuring something. 
3371.83,So he's measuring the Omega-
3,Index. 
3373.957,And he's measuring the Omega-
3,"Index in people, "
3376.55,"and then looking at their mortality risk, for example, "
3378.86,or their cardiovascular disease risk. 
3380.55,"And what he has found is that, "
3384.15,"first of all, standard American diet "
3387.13,has an Omega-
3,Index of 
5%.,
3389.77,"Japan, by contrast, has an Omega-"
3,Index 
3392.86,of around 
10,to 
11%.,
3395.743,Big difference there. 
3396.71,And they also have about a five-year 
3399.09,increased life expectancy compared to people in the US. 
3402.6,"- Do you think that's mainly due to their fish intake, "
3404.6,seafood intake? 
3405.433,"- So what he showed was, "
3407.04,I think it's a big part of it. 
3409.65,"I mean, you can't says it's the only thing, "
3411.65,"but what he showed in his data was that, "
3414.06,"and I think it was Framingham Study, "
3416.87,where he looked at the Omega-
3,"Index, "
3419.027,and people that had a Omega-
3,Index of 
4%,"or lower, "
3423.48,so close to what the standard American is 
3424.313,"but a little bit lower, "
3426.99,they had a five-year decreased life expectancy 
3430.87,compared to people that had an 
8%,Omega-
3,Index. 
3434.56,"And so big difference there, right? "
3437.138,Five years life expectancy. 
3438.96,"But here's the really interesting thing, Andrew. "
3441.01,"He also looked at smokers, "
3443.48,smokers and their omega-
3,"levels, "
3444.727,"and so he stratified it, and he found smokers "
3448.06,that had no omega-
3,were like the worst of all. 
3451.197,"I mean, it was just like worse, right? "
3453.67,We all know smoking is bad for us 
3455.44,and will take years off our life expectancy. 
3457.696,- [Andrew] Absolutely. 
3458.529,"- But smokers that had the high level, "
3460.42,like smokers that were taking their fish oil or eating fish 
3462.93,or whatever it was they were doing to get them up to 
"8%,",
3465.72,they had the same life expectancy as non-smokers 
3468.53,with the low Omega-
3,Index. 
3470.478,- [Andrew] Wow. 
3471.311,- Right? - Wow. 
3473.102,That's amazing. 
3475.84,And it's also amazing to me 
3476.76,that people still smoke cigarettes. 
3478.3,"But I see a lot of people vaping, "
3480.27,and I know a lot of people consume cannabis. 
3485.31,Have there been any studies specifically of vaping 
3488.4,or people smoking marijuana? 
3492.692,- Life expectancy? - All-cause mortality. 
3494.13,- I haven't seen those. I haven't seen those. 
3496.28,- They're not motivated enough to come in 
3497.47,as research subjects. 
3499.11,"That was, again, a poor joke. "
3501.75,"It is hard to study people, marijuana use, "
3504.72,"unless, I'm told by my colleagues that study this stuff, "
3507.47,"unless you offer people marijuana, "
3508.95,in which case they'll do it. 
3511.03,"But, again, they're actually not very good research subjects "
3513.71,in all seriousness 'cause they are not very motivated 
3515.71,"or consistent, and they forget their appointments. "
3518.35,So that's incredible. 
3521.48,And you mentioned that the data on pollution 
3523.45,related to the plant compounds earlier. 
3525.55,"So it's almost like these things are, "
3527.25,"again, are acting in a reparative way. "
3532.61,- The omega-
3s,"are, I mean, "
3534.49,they are resolving inflammation. 
3537.22,They're blunting inflammation. 
3538.92,They're doing so many different. 
3542.45,They affect so many different parts 
3543.95,"of the inflammatory pathway, "
3545.06,"which is, I think, plays a huge role in the way we age, "
3548.96,"the way our brain ages, the way we feel, "
3550.4,"our mood, our joints, all that. "
3552.87,"And so it's amazing that it's not, you know. "
3557.111,- I love fish oil. I feel better when I take it. 
3559.74,I try to eat some fatty fish a couple times a week. 
3563.81,I do want to just touch on food sources for a moment. 
3567.49,"First of all, are there plants that are rich in omega-"
3s?,
3571.75,"And second, I have some friends who are really into meat. "
3577.42,"I like meat a lot, my dad's Argentine, "
3579.41,but I don't eat very much of it. 
3580.86,I try and eat high quality meats 
3582.07,"in relatively limited amounts, but I do eat pretty often. "
3586.48,But I've been told by these sources 
3590.83,"of a questionable authority that, "
3593.0,"if an animal grazes on really good grasses, for instance, "
3596.55,that the meat can contain a lot of omega-
"3s,",
3599.3,"which, in principle, makes sense "
3601.1,based on this Omega-
3,Index. 
3602.52,'Cause you're telling me that a lot of this omega-
3,
3604.44,is sequestered into the red blood cells. 
3606.6,"So, if I'm eating high quality, grass-fed meat "
3609.22,and the grasses had omega-
"3s,",
3611.85,do my steaks have omega-
3s,or no? 
3614.84,- So there was a study published 
3616.75,"that compared conventional meat, "
3619.71,so meat that animals are fed corn or soy or whatever it is. 
3625.22,- Which is terrible. - [Rhonda] Yeah. 
3626.84,"- For animals and people, as far as I can tell. "
3629.27,"I'm sure I'll get some attacks, but that's okay. "
3632.48,I won't read those comments. 
3635.4,"Again, a joke. I read all the comments. "
3637.16,But it seems to me that these animals 
3641.05,have to either be taking fish oil 
3643.73,or eat plants that are very rich in omega-
3s,
3647.07,in order for the meat 
3648.4,to actually contain sufficient omega-
3s.,
3650.684,"- So the meat, comparing the conventional meat "
3653.01,"to the grass-fed or pasture-raised cows or cattle, "
3659.25,there were higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid. 
3663.14,"And ALA, it can be converted into EPA and DHA, "
3669.43,but the conversion is very inefficient 
3673.22,"and very dependent on a variety of factors, "
3675.93,including genetics. 
3677.66,"Genetics, a huge regulator. "
3680.83,Some people can do it much better. 
3683.21,"Others, you're getting like "
5%,of conversion to EPA. 
3687.99,Estrogen is a major regulator of making that more efficient. 
3693.02,"It makes sense because pregnancy, "
3695.22,when your estrogen just goes through the roof. 
3698.66,These omega-
3,fatty acids play a very important role 
3700.74,in brain development. 
3703.686,Women are supposed to be converting any ALA they can 
3707.25,into the longer-chain omega-
3,fatty acids. 
3710.261,"So estrogen does affect that, "
3713.34,but I would say plant sources. 
3715.13,"So, if you're looking for the ALA, "
3717.91,"plant sources would be walnuts, flaxseeds. "
3721.38,Those are probably the highest. 
3723.06,"But, if a person is a vegan or a vegetarian, "
3726.83,their best bet is to actually get microalgae oil. 
3730.14,And you can supplement with microalgae oil 
3732.07,"because microalgae, they do make the DHA. "
3736.74,And so that would be a better source 
3740.65,for people that are vegetarian and vegan 
3743.9,rather than doing the flaxseed oil 
3746.32,"because that conversion inefficiency, "
3748.43,"the enzymes that convert ALA into EPA and DHA, "
3752.3,"again, it's inefficient. "
3753.72,"- And then, for people that eat fish, "
3756.49,"sardines, you said. "
3758.42,- [Rhonda] Salmon. 
3759.253,"- Salmon, and you have to eat the skin, as I understand. "
3762.473,"- You don't have to, but it's good. "
3764.248,- [Andrew] It's rich with omegas. 
3765.19,"- The oil, yeah. "
3766.563,"And the reason I say, "
3768.43,I think the best would be wild Alaskan salmon 
3772.21,"versus the farm-raised because the farm-raised, again, "
3774.44,they're feeding 'em corn. 
3777.27,They're feeding 'em grain and stuff. 
3778.857,- [Andrew] Really? 
3779.69,"- And then, they give 'em astaxanthin. "
3781.227,So astaxanthin is a carotenoid. 
3782.88,"It's the carotenoid that's in things like krill, "
3785.03,crustaceans that make their red pigment. 
3787.2,"- Yeah, it's also being used now as a supplement, "
3790.047,and there's a prescription form 
3792.04,to try and rescue some age-related vision loss 
3795.24,because of the role of the vitamin A pathway 
3798.54,and photoreceptors. 
3800.15,"- Yeah, well, actually the carotinoids themselves, "
3802.58,"so like lutein, zeaxathin, "
3803.92,"they're really good at sequestering singlet oxygen, "
3806.76,"which is damaging, right? "
3808.76,"- Yeah, as we age, "
3810.74,"because the retinal cells, the cells of the eye "
3813.73,"are so metabolically active, "
3815.26,"they accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species, "
3818.24,and mitochondrial repair 
3820.86,and limiting reactive oxygen species 
3823.41,is a major theme of trying to rescue vision. 
3826.963,That's a whole other podcast and story. 
3829.16,There's some really interesting data now 
3830.6,on the use of red light to try and trigger 
3832.34,these pathways. - I've seen some. 
3834.3,That's my good friend of many years and amazing scientist 
3837.65,Glen Jeffery's lab at University College London. 
3840.65,"We should talk about that at some point, if not today. "
3842.56,"- I saw that study, like "
"2020,",was it? 
3844.357,"- Now, they have a second study. "
3845.22,"- Oh, do they? They've done, okay. "
3846.18,- It's looking real. 
3847.822,"- [Rhonda] That's exciting. - I mean, they're cautious. "
3849.46,They're appropriately British and cautious about it. 
3853.02,"I always joke if those studies had been done over here, "
3855.13,everyone would already know about it. 
3856.87,"Glen is a very conservative guy, "
3859.02,"but they've done this stuff now in pigs, in rodent models, "
3862.09,and now also two studies in humans. 
3863.78,It's looking pretty interesting. 
3866.6,So sardines but also anchovies. 
3870.023,"By the way, I hate all the food items that I'm describing. "
3872.73,I can barely tolerate salmon. 
3874.44,I don't like fish at all. 
3875.77,"Actually, I like live fish. - So fish oil's good for you. "
3877.06,- I had fish tanks when I was a kid. 
3879.4,"No, I find fish, unless it's in sushi form, "
3881.61,"I find it absolutely repulsive, and I don't know why. "
3884.57,I probably have some mutation. 
3885.92,- So raw fish is actually higher in mercury than cooked. 
3889.17,"- Okay, well, that's good. "
3890.003,I don't really like sushi that much anyway. 
3892.51,"You're giving me great reasons to not eat fish, "
3895.18,except I should eat these other fish sources 
3897.05,or supplement more heavily. 
3898.4,That's the message I'm getting. 
3899.801,- I eat sardines. 
3901.07,"Every day, my first meal almost "
3903.19,is a can of sardines and an avocado. 
3905.843,- Avocado is good. 
3906.676,"- I love it, yeah, with a little bit of lemon "
3908.43,and then some little hot sauce. 
3911.15,- Does avocado have omega-
3s?,
3912.453,- Avocado is very good in monounsaturated fat. 
3915.9,It's not really high in polyunsaturated fat. 
3917.61,Omega-
"3,","really, it's either the DHA and EPA "
3922.13,"that's in the marine sources fish, "
3924.39,"or it's the plant ALA source, "
3926.3,which is the flaxseed or the walnuts. 
3929.77,- It's rough. 
3930.603,"I mean, all these companies now "
3932.85,are making these plant-based products that taste like meat. 
3937.41,My wish is that they would just make a fish 
3939.31,"that tastes like a steak, but that's- "
3941.057,"- The fish come out albino, the ones that they farm raise, "
3943.55,because they don't eat any of the- 
3945.59,- I'm joking. 
3946.423,I don't want a genetically modified fish 
3948.36,that tastes like a steak. 
3949.28,"Although, I love the taste of steak. "
3951.73,"The point here is that, if one doesn't see themselves "
3956.26,regularly consuming these fish sources of omega-
"3s,",
3962.0,it seems to me that the only way to really get them 
3964.82,is from supplementation. 
3967.44,- And supplementation is a good way to get a high dose. 
3971.19,"And to get back to your dose point, "
3973.53,"there was a couple of studies that, basically, "
3978.64,I think there was some way they showed that people 
3980.79,that are in the 
4%,Omega-
3,"Index range, "
3983.79,in order to get to the 
"8%,",
3985.43,the five-year increased life expectancy 
3987.75,"if we're comparing the two groups, "
3989.55,was to supplement with at least two grams. 
3992.19,It was about two grams a day. 
3994.437,And I think it was a little bit less 
3995.67,"if it was triglyceride form, "
3996.92,"but I think two grams is a good, safe number. "
4000.12,So most Americans that are not eating a lot of fish 
4003.71,and they're not supplementing 
4004.543,are probably around a 
4,to 
5%,Omega-
3,Index. 
4007.66,And to get to the 
8%.,
4009.57,And I think that's a good empirical way 
4012.73,"of thinking about it, right? "
4013.79,"Okay, well, I want to get to that "
8%.,
4014.837,"By the way, I'm almost "
16%,Omega-
3,Index. 
4017.64,"- Yeah, I was going to ask about testing. "
4020.121,"So, where and how can somebody measure their Omega-"
3,Index? 
4025.98,"Which, again, just to remind people, "
4027.15,is essentially the percentage of omega-
3s,
4029.69,that you have in your blood 
4030.86,with the caveat that the Omega-
3,Index 
4035.4,will be heavily biased by what you ate in the previous days. 
4038.76,- Not the Omega-
3,Index. 
4039.98,"Okay, so, the Omega-"
3-,"- Sorry, I misunderstood. "
4041.51,"I thought you said, in red blood cells, "
4042.83,"if I ate salmon two days ago, "
4044.18,my Omega-
3,Index is going to go up. 
4045.86,"- No, that was plasma. "
4047.11,- [Andrew] I misunderstood. 
4048.248,"- So most people are measuring, "
4050.55,"if you look at a lot of studies, and honestly, Andrew, "
4052.639,I think a lot of the reason for conflicting data 
4055.38,is because people are measuring plasma omega-
3,levels. 
4059.516,- [Andrew] Okay. 
4060.349,"- The phospholipids. It's in a phospholipid, right? "
4062.09,Your phospholipids are carrying things. 
4064.3,These are lipoproteins. 
4065.85,They're carrying things like omega-
3,
4067.52,and triglycerides and stuff and shuttling 'em around. 
4070.72,The Omega-
3,"Index is actually in the red blood cells, "
4073.72,and red blood cells take 
120,days to turn over. 
4076.83,"So, if you're going to do a baseline test, "
4079.71,"if you want to know before supplementing what your level is, "
4082.68,you have to wait 
120,days before doing the second test 
4086.11,after supplementing to know how much you went up 
4088.19,because that's how long it takes 
4090.57,for your red blood cell to turn over. 
4092.39,So the Omega-
3,Index. 
4094.46,Bill Harris has a company that he co-founded. 
4099.39,"It's called OmegaQuant, "
4101.35,and they measure the Omega-
3,Index. 
4103.39,They have a variety of different index tests. 
4105.78,You can do a basic one or a little more advanced. 
4107.7,- This is from a blood draw. 
4109.2,"- It's a little blood spot thing, yeah. "
4111.16,And he uses money to funnel back into doing lipid research. 
4115.15,He's out there doing all sorts of interesting studies 
4117.7,on omega-
"3s,",so it's great. 
4119.285,But the Omega-
3,Index is great. 
4121.26,"I think that, honestly, more people "
4124.05,and more researchers should be using it 
4126.21,"because the conflicting data, "
4129.31,"it always comes down to what we're measuring, "
4132.45,the sensitivity of it. 
4134.72,Are we even measuring anything? 
4136.11,So you're giving someone 
500,"milligrams of DHA, "
4140.0,and you don't see any effect. 
4140.96,"Well, did you measure what their levels were? "
4142.8,And did you measure the Omega-
3,Index? 
4145.84,There's all sorts of problems 
4147.14,"with randomized controlled trials, "
4149.4,"and I think that we need to, as scientists, "
4153.18,we need to come together and make some progress. 
4156.06,"I mean, you know? Let's all talk to each other. "
4158.472,Let's figure things out. 
4160.97,This test is out there. It should be used. 
4163.36,"It should be used not just by Bill's group, but everyone. "
4166.26,"- Yeah, well, and I'm learning so much from you. "
4168.987,And I agree we need more collaboration. 
4172.02,I've always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations 
4174.51,in my lab at Stanford. 
4176.33,Collaborating is just so much more fun. 
4177.97,"Online, there seems to be a bias more towards creating silos "
4181.64,"as opposed to bridges, "
4183.8,but I appreciate that you bring up the need 
4186.91,for more collaboration. 
4187.83,"And knowing which measures are best, "
4190.05,"and, in this case, now, thank you for the clarification, "
4192.39,I understand this Omega-
3,Index is going to be best. 
4195.792,"So, basically, now, when I look at you, "
4196.625,"I think, you are "
16%,omega-
3.,
4199.13,- And dolphins are 
19%.,I'm almost- 
4201.4,- Is that your goal? You're trying to get there. 
4203.153,- It is. [laughs] 
4205.58,- Interesting. 
4206.75,"Actually, they should probably do something "
4208.159,where you're trying to achieve the omega-
3,ratio 
4210.95,of your favorite species. 
4214.29,Now that we've covered a bit of how to get these things 
4217.06,"into one system, depending on what one eats, et cetera, "
4220.07,"and some of the better measurements, "
4222.92,how is omega-
3,"and some of these other related lipids, "
4227.53,how are they having these positive effects? 
4229.31,"In my mind, and this is incredibly elementary, "
4233.12,"but my understanding is that, at some level, "
4235.06,they're making platelets more slippery. 
4237.06,Is that true or not? 
4238.52,I'm happy to be wrong. 
4240.46,How is it possibly impacting my mood? 
4243.03,Is it through the synthesis of membrane on neurons 
4245.87,"that allows neurons to release more transmitter, "
4248.53,like serotonin and dopamine? 
4250.51,"What are some of the purported, reported, "
4253.68,and known mechanisms? 
4255.52,- I think some of the most well-known mechanisms 
4259.64,do have to do with the omega-
3,fatty acids 
4262.76,being very powerful regulators of the inflammatory process 
4267.54,"in some way, shape, or form, "
4269.17,whether that has to do with resolvins that are produced 
4272.43,"from the metabolites of DHA, for example. "
4276.06,Resolvins play a role in resolving inflammation. 
4279.84,You want your inflammatory response to be activated 
4282.36,"when it's supposed to be, "
4283.58,but you want to resolve that inflammation 
4285.19,"and the inflammatory response in a timely manner, right? "
4288.887,And resolvins help do that. 
4290.745,"And so resolvins are one, "
4292.68,"and then there's these specialized pro-mediating molecules, "
4296.01,"the SPMs, that also help resolve the inflammation. "
4299.46,"There's, like you mentioned, "
4300.47,"the leukotrienes and prostaglandins, "
4302.367,"and these things are being affected by EPA, "
4304.07,"and they do affect platelets and platelet aggregation, "
4307.33,and they do affect that whole pathway as well. 
4312.87,I think there's just so many different ways and inputs. 
4317.18,"And so, when we talk about inflammation, "
4318.97,"honestly, that's a big general term, "
4321.61,but when you're talking about serotonin release 
4325.513,"at the level of neurons, "
4327.51,we know that these inflammatory molecules 
4329.25,cross the blood-brain barrier. 
4330.45,I just mentioned ago about injecting people 
4332.24,with lipopolysaccharide and causing and depressive symptoms. 
4336.26,It's known that omega-
"3,","actually specifically EPA, "
4341.55,is able to help serotonin. 
4343.93,"Inflammation inhibits the release of serotonin, "
4346.67,and so EPA is actually able to blunt inflammatory responses 
4351.4,along with DHA as well. 
4352.49,DHA does that through resolvins and stuff. 
4354.41,And this then helps more serotonin be released 
4357.48,because you're not having so much inflammation 
4360.15,getting into the brain 
4361.3,"and affecting serotonin release, right? "
4363.17,That's one mechanism. 
4364.06,"And then, another would be, "
4364.98,"well, DHA itself has been shown, "
4366.83,it's a very important fatty acid 
4369.63,"that makes up cell membranes, many cell membranes, "
4371.61,including in our neurons. 
4373.07,"And, as you very well know, Andrew, "
4375.1,"the structure and function of receptors of transporters, "
4378.69,"these membrane-bound proteins on the surface of our cells, "
4382.64,"including neurons, "
4383.9,"are affected by the membrane fluidity, "
4386.57,"like how rigid and how fluid the cell membrane is, "
4390.84,and DHA plays a role in that. 
4392.743,"And so, for example, in animal studies, "
4394.65,"if you make an animal deficient in DHA, "
4397.25,"their serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, "
4399.99,they're affected because the structure of them is affected 
4403.57,through the fluidity of the membrane. 
4405.94,And so I think that's another mechanism. 
4409.29,And I'm talking sort of general 
4411.29,'cause I'm not a neuroscientist. 
4412.64,"- No, but it makes perfect sense. "
4414.27,"We know, for instance, neuroplasticity almost always "
4419.6,involves the recruitment of more receptors 
4421.44,or an improvement in some feature 
4423.93,of receptors to neurotransmitters. 
4426.63,And they literally move laterally in the membrane. 
4429.29,They kind of float around like little rafts. 
4430.95,"Sometimes they are, in fact, in lipid rafts. "
4433.476,"So it makes perfect sense that these molecules like DHA, "
4436.31,"which are part of the structural fat of the neuron, "
4438.94,"because, of course, the outsides of neurons "
4440.48,"are basically fat, "
4441.56,"not just the myelin that people have heard of, "
4443.51,"but the actual membranes, that getting that right, "
4447.97,"you wouldn't want it as rigid as concrete, "
4449.72,but you wouldn't want it as soft as... 
4452.64,Need to come up with something here. 
4453.807,What's that gooey stuff that kids play with? 
4455.95,It's like that goo. Anyway. 
4457.82,"- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, it's disgusting, "
4459.83,and it's too soft to be a membrane for a neuron. 
4462.17,"- You get it in those machines, like the claw machines. "
4463.96,- Someone put it in the comments 
4464.91,and tell me what that disgusting gooey stuff is. 
4467.41,"You don't want your neurons to be that gooey, "
4469.66,and yet you don't want them to be like concrete either. 
4472.082,- It's a balance. Yeah. - It's a balance. 
4474.26,"And, in mentioning DHA, I realize I'm backtracking, "
4478.84,but I want to make sure that we close 
4480.1,all the hatches for people. 
4482.07,"We talked a lot about EPA, "
4484.53,but are food sources of DHA 
4488.57,"that you find particularly attractive, "
4491.09,"either by taste or by potency for DHA, "
4493.851,what are just a few that we could throw out? 
4495.93,Because I am aware that there are supplements 
4498.59,"where you can get a nice ratio of EPA to DHA, "
4500.99,"or you take them separately, as you do. "
4502.74,"But if I want to make sure that I'm getting enough DHA, "
4504.823,what do I need to be sure I'm eating on a regular basis? 
4507.29,"- Well, the fish is packaging the DHA and EPA in the ratio, "
4511.284,"but I also do eat salmon roe, which is very salty, "
4516.37,and it's a really high source 
4518.75,of the phosphatidylcholine DHA 
4522.26,that we talked about. - So this is fish eggs. 
4523.49,"- It is, and actually- "
4524.97,- [Andrew] That I like for some reason. 
4526.585,"- Oh, do you? "
4527.418,"- Yeah, so I'm discovering something about myself. "
4530.43,"This was not meant to be nutritional psychotherapy, "
4533.27,but you're doing that for me anyway. 
4534.93,"I'm discovering that, yeah, I like eating embryonic fish. "
4537.62,I just don't like eating the actual fish. 
4539.53,"- Okay, well. "
4540.6,"- Okay, so fish eggs are okay. So caviar, basically. "
4543.72,"- Caviar, yes. "
4544.57,And that's a good source of the phospholipid form. 
4547.0,And I was consuming that a lot 
4548.48,because I wanted to get the phospholipid form. 
4550.513,- [Andrew] Yum! 
4551.51,- And it's actually really good. 
4552.53,There's been some animal studies 
4553.82,in piglets and rodents as well 
4555.88,showing that consuming phospholipid DHA 
4561.25,during fetal brain development 
4563.29,gets like 
10,times more DHA in the brain. 
4566.13,"Again, it's- "
4567.21,- Makes sense based on fetal development. 
4569.89,"So, do I need to buy beluga caviar? "
4573.47,Stuff can get pretty expensive 
4574.65,at $
200,a tin. - I don't think you need to. 
4577.07,I think it's a matter of preference. 
4580.16,And if you're supplementing 
4582.37,"with your two to four grams of fish oil, "
4585.29,"I mean, you're going to get phospholipid form anyway "
4588.48,'cause your body's going to make it. 
4589.63,"- Okay, I've seen some containers "
4591.53,of what I assume to be quality fish eggs 
4594.17,that are not at the caviar level 
4596.65,that you can find in the better grocery stores 
4598.71,that aren't super expensive. 
4600.095,- [Rhonda] Right. 
4600.928,"- I wouldn't dip as low as to go eat, "
4602.12,"for instance, like fishing bait. "
4604.4,"Like, when we were kids, we used to go fishing, "
4605.85,and you'd put the fish egg on the thing. 
4607.14,That's probably not good. - No. 
4608.34,- Although it's good enough for the fish apparently. Okay. 
4611.28,"Only half joking here, folks. "
4612.57,I'm just trying to protect you from yourselves. 
4614.53,Don't get any crazy ideas about eating fishing bait. 
4618.064,"Okay, so that's great to know. "
4620.62,"So we have these plant-based compounds, "
4622.37,we have the omega-
"3s,","so EPA, DHA, "
4624.84,and then you mentioned there's a third category. 
4627.22,What would you place in your third category 
4629.24,of foods or supplement-based nutrients 
4634.23,"that our health, brain and/or body health, "
4637.82,can really benefit from? 
4639.2,"- I mean, I think the most obvious would be vitamin D, "
4641.6,"which is actually, as you know, a steroid hormone "
4644.793,that we produce when we're in the sun. 
4648.04,"Depending on the time of year, we can make it in our skin. "
4651.75,"And depending on how much melanin we have on our skin, "
4654.22,"or whether or not we're wearing sunscreen or how old we are, "
4658.23,there's a sliding scale on how efficient that process is. 
4661.29,"- As I understand, there's an inverse relationship, "
4663.6,"where the darker your skin is naturally, "
4668.29,the more vitamin D you need to consume. 
4670.47,Is that right? 
4671.37,"- Well, the darker your skin is, the harder it is. "
4674.49,"So there was a study out of the University of Chicago, "
4676.89,"this was several years ago, "
4677.88,where they looked at African Americans 
4680.69,and compared African Americans to Caucasians 
4684.0,"with light skin, fair skin, "
4685.55,"and how well they could make vitamin D from sun exposure, "
4689.01,and how long they had to be in the sun to make X amount. 
4693.35,And it turns out that African Americans 
4695.62,"with darker pigmentation, "
4697.15,"which protects them from the burning rays of the sun, "
4699.03,"it's a natural sunscreen, "
4700.47,had to stay in the sun six times as long 
4703.84,as someone with none of that natural sunscreen. 
4706.93,So I think the take-home there is a lot of people 
4712.16,"with darker skin living in Sub-Saharan Africa, "
4714.64,"or people living in India with darker skin, "
4717.16,"or in the Philippines, "
4718.22,"you know, these equatorial regions "
4720.154,where you tend to see darker skin 
4722.63,because it's protection from the burning rays of the sun. 
4724.34,- An adaptation. 
4725.2,"- They are in the sun more, "
4727.194,"and they're getting more vitamin D, "
4728.85,"but people that maybe moved to United States, "
4731.22,"to like Minnesota, or in a place where UVB radiation "
4735.61,isn't getting to the atmosphere 
12,months out of the year. 
4738.89,"It's only getting there four months, for example. "
4741.98,"Or even living in our modern day society, "
4743.47,where people just don't go outside anymore. 
4744.96,"I mean, we're inside. "
4745.793,We're at our laptops in school. 
4747.76,"We're at work. We're in our cubicle, whatever. "
4749.5,"So supplementation does play a major role, "
4752.37,not only for people with darker skin 
4755.03,"that aren't outside all the time, but for everyone. "
4756.98,
70%,of the US population has inadequate vitamin D levels. 
4761.84,
70,of the whole US. - [Andrew] Amazing. 
4764.34,- So this is everyone. 
4765.81,And so I think that insufficient levels 
4768.76,defined as less than 
30,"nanograms per milliliter, "
4773.902,"and that's defined by the Endocrine Society, "
4778.279,"looking at a lot of different aggregate studies, "
4781.6,"all-cause mortality, for example. "
4783.93,There's been a lot of different meta analyses 
4786.12,"of all-cause mortality studies, "
4787.61,where vitamin D levels really seem to be ideal 
4791.33,between 
40,to 
60,nanograms per milliliter. 
4794.82,"And so, in order to get to that level, "
4797.94,"if you are not outside all the time, "
4801.013,"live in Southern California, "
4802.68,where you're always outside without sunscreen on. 
4804.87,I always wear sunscreen 
4805.76,because I'm trying to protect my skin 
4807.59,"from so many wrinkles and stuff, "
4809.38,but also skin cancer is somewhat of an issue as well. 
4814.58,"So, basically, the point is that vitamin D "
4816.64,"is a steroid hormone, meaning it actually binds "
4820.01,"to a receptor and another receptor dimerizes with it, "
4824.512,"the retinoid receptor, "
4826.19,"and that complex goes into the nucleus of a cell, "
4829.85,"where your DNA is, "
4831.18,and it recognizes little sequences of DNA 
4834.28,called vitamin D response elements. 
4835.94,They're called VDREs. 
4837.41,"They're specific sequences of DNA that this complex, "
4840.91,"vitamin D bound with the vitamin D receptor, "
4842.85,goes inside and recognizes 
4844.44,"and turns on a whole host of genes, "
4846.49,turns off a whole host of genes. 
4847.83,"I mean, this is important stuff. "
4851.52,Imagine 
70%,of the population 
4853.69,"having insufficient testosterone, right? "
4856.36,It's a steroid hormone. 
4857.9,"- We might be headed there, but probably not. "
4860.93,"No, I think that names are very important, "
4863.98,and I think that one of the issues is that vitamin D 
4867.08,is called vitamin D. 
4869.33,"It's not called DHEA or variant blah, blah, blah. "
4873.73,It doesn't sound like a hormone. 
4875.79,I'm glad that you're mentioning skin as the major interface 
4880.14,between the environment and vitamin D synthesis 
4882.52,because a lot of people think of skin 
4884.37,as just a protective sheath around us 
4886.87,or something to adorn ourselves with earrings 
4888.79,"or tattoos or whatever, "
4890.14,"but skin obviously serves those roles, "
4892.42,but the skin is an endocrine organ. 
4894.95,It has the capacity to make things that impact hormones 
4898.15,and to make hormones. 
4899.66,There's this beautiful study out this last year. 
4902.7,"This took place over in Israel, "
4904.17,where they had people get outside 
4905.57,for 
20,or 
30,"minutes a day, three times a week, "
4909.01,exposing a culturally acceptable 
4912.36,"yet substantial amount of their skin during that time, "
4915.95,and saw big increases in testosterone and estrogen. 
4919.26,And this is through a keratinocyte-linked pathway 
4921.95,involving p
53.,
4923.77,"This was done in humans, "
4924.66,but they did some knockout studies in parallel. 
4926.31,And what this study told me or reminded me 
4928.38,is that skin is an endocrine organ. 
4929.91,So the idea that sun could trigger the activation 
4932.43,of production of a hormone is really interesting 
4936.55,and makes total sense. 
4937.77,"So, when vitamin D gets into cells, "
4940.18,and it's binding to these VDR 
4942.934,"- [Rhonda] Es. - Es, "
4945.165,what sorts of things are they triggering? 
4947.78,"So, for testosterone, "
4948.79,"we know it's going to trigger protein synthesis, "
4950.56,"muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera, "
4952.3,"With estrogen, it's going to keep your neurons going, "
4955.36,your joints feeling good. 
4956.71,"I always remind people that, by the way, "
4959.0,'cause guys always seem to want 
4960.75,to increase their testosterone and reduce their estrogen. 
4963.07,"Just remind people, if you reduce your estrogen, guys, "
4965.8,your libido will plummet to near zero. 
4967.81,Don't crush your estrogen. 
4969.62,It'll also make you stupid. 
4972.07,"If you're not already stupid, it will make you stupid. "
4975.76,So estrogen's vitally important for males and females. 
4978.9,"When vitamin D gets into cells, "
4981.47,what sorts of things is it stimulating? 
4984.131,"- Okay, so, first of all, it's regulating more than "
5%,
4986.89,of the protein-encoded human genome. 
4990.77,"I say more than because, when I was looking at this data "
4994.28,really in depth starting in 
2012,to 
"2014,",
5000.56,"it was that, and then it's now grown. "
5002.78,But one of the important things that you'll find interesting 
5005.75,that I published on back in 
2014,
5007.39,"was that I'd gone through this big, published database, "
5012.59,where someone had published all these genes 
5014.71,"they found VDREs in, "
5016.49,and basically I found that tryptophan hydroxylase-
1,
5022.17,and tryptophan hydroxylase-
2,was on there. 
5024.9,"And so then I started looking at the sequence, "
5026.33,"and I was doing some in silico work, "
5028.09,and it turns out that the VDREs in tryptophan hydroxylase-
2.,
5032.93,"So, for people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase "
5036.81,is an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin. 
5040.86,So tryptophan is an amino acid that we get from our food. 
5045.05,"You convert tryptophan into serotonin in the gut, "
5049.5,but you also do it in the brain. 
5051.25,"However, serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier. "
5053.84,"So tryptophan has to get into your brain, "
5056.55,and then you have to convert it to serotonin in your brain. 
5059.102,"Well, the enzyme that does that in your brain "
5061.64,is called tryptophan hydroxylase-
"2,",
5063.68,and it's activated by vitamin D. 
5066.773,The one in the gut is actually tryptophan hydroxylase-
1.,
5070.56,Some of my published work hypothesized 
5073.37,that it might actually be repressed by vitamin D 
5075.82,because it has a sequence. 
5077.69,"The sequence itself, this "
12,"nucleotide sequence, "
5081.58,"can determine, to some degree, "
5083.96,whether it's going to be activated or turned off. 
5085.749,"And I was able to kind of look at that and think, "
5087.58,"oh, maybe this and that. "
5089.22,"Since then, there have been some groups "
5090.61,that have confirmed more with in vivo 
5093.31,and/or in vitro studies. 
5094.95,"Mine was all in silico and all that stuff, but anyways. "
5098.32,"So serotonin, a really important one. "
5101.942,"This is regulating our immune cell, immune system. "
5105.49,It's regulating our blood pressure. 
5109.98,That's water retention. 
5112.58,"Bone, of course, homeostasis. "
5114.51,
5%.,More than 
5%.,
5116.46,"I can't tell you. Like, so much. "
5119.35,- And with 
70%,"of the US population deficient, "
5124.91,I'm beginning to think that this could be the linchpin 
5127.48,on a number of really important issues. 
5129.98,So supplementing vitamin D
3,is what I normally hear. 
5135.17,I do. 
5136.63,I think I end up taking 
"5,",
000,"IUs, "
5139.47,sometimes 
10,IUs of vitamin D
3,per day. 
5142.34,"Just done that for a long time, "
5143.48,and I've had my levels tested and they're in range. 
5145.83,"But I have a family member, I'll just mention this. "
5148.16,"I have a family member who was not feeling well, "
5151.03,"just kind of feeling off, a little low, "
5153.03,"had some digestive issues, "
5154.39,"this went on a long period of time, "
5156.59,"was taking, on my recommendation, "
"15,",
000,IUs of D
3,
5161.36,and was still deficient in D
3.,
5163.78,"Now takes, and I'm not suggesting anyone do this. "
5165.513,"This is a special case, perhaps, "
5167.82,but no chronic illness that we're aware of. 
5171.19,Needs to take 
"30,",
000,IUs per day 
5173.81,in order to bring their D
3,"range just into normal, "
5178.1,"which, to me, is striking because they eat quite well, "
5180.49,"they're a healthy weight, et cetera, "
5182.71,and it's made a tremendous difference 
5184.07,in terms of their mood. 
5184.903,"Now, of course, this is correlative. "
5185.96,Now they feel better. They're doing it. 
5187.25,Who knows? They're probably also getting outside more. 
5189.33,But I think people need to get tested. 
5193.0,They need to get their D
3,levels tested. 
5195.56,But where and what is a good starting range 
5198.67,for people to think about D
3,"supplementation, "
5201.27,"and, again, foods that can increase D"
3?,
5205.47,- So vitamin D
3,is a good way to supplement with it. 
5209.29,Vitamin D
2,would be a plant source. 
5210.98,You often find it fortified in foods 
5213.55,"like milk, usually D"
2.,
5215.22,- Does anyone still drink milk besides kids? 
5219.91,"- Out here, it's like you can't find cows milk. "
5222.27,"- [Rhonda] I mean, all the lattes "
5223.538,"that you're getting. - Oat milk, soy milk. "
5225.303,What's the other one? 
5226.31,- [Rhonda] They're fortified in those as well. 
5227.88,"- Oh, they are. Okay. "
5228.713,"- [Rhonda] They are, yeah. They're fortified in- "
5229.76,- I have a hard time 
5230.593,finding cows milk. - Almond milk and oat milk 
5231.61,"and all that stuff, yeah. "
5233.48,They're in all that stuff. 
5235.62,Vitamin D is naturally to some degree in fatty fish. 
5239.72,"You think about cod liver oil, right? "
5242.33,"It has vitamin D, "
5243.163,but you're not going to correct a deficiency 
5246.536,with eating fish for your vitamin D. 
5249.45,"You're either going to correct it with sun exposure, "
5251.92,"being in the right area, having the right amount of sun, "
5254.26,"and being the right age, "
5255.9,"because, as you get old, you become very inefficient "
5258.47,"at converting vitamin D, making vitamin D"
3,in your skin. 
5263.737,"- Well, that's probably what was going on here "
5265.447,'cause this person is getting up in their age. 
5267.183,- There's a lot of single nucleotide polymorphisms. 
5270.435,We talked about APOE
4,"before previously, "
5272.1,"but there's a variety of genes that people have, "
5276.27,"very common, actually. "
5277.46,"In fact, I've had many people that have done "
5279.84,that exact same thing. 
5281.08,So measuring your vitamin D levels 
5284.51,before and after supplementation 
5286.43,"is the only way you're going to figure that out, right? "
5288.4,Very important. 
5289.233,"If you don't measure it, you don't know. "
5291.23,You can't know what you don't measure. 
5294.89,So there's a variety of SNPs 
5296.61,that basically make that conversion inefficient. 
5299.15,"And, in fact, there've been a lot "
5301.462,of these Mendelian randomization studies. 
5303.39,So these are studies where scientists 
5307.14,"will look at commons SNPs, "
5310.08,people that have these common variations of a gene. 
5313.31,That's more than 
1%,of the population. 
5315.85,So it's not a random mutation. 
5317.24,It's actually found in a sizeable percent of the population. 
5320.777,"And then, they've looked at various outcomes. "
5323.41,"And a lot of times, they'll look at genes "
5325.36,"that are also involved in some kind of lifestyle factor, "
5327.89,"so vitamin D, "
5328.85,and SNPs that basically make the conversion 
5332.0,of either vitamin D precursor into D
"3,",
5335.47,or D
3,into 
25-hydroxy,"vitamin D, "
5338.21,"or into the active steroid hormone, "
5339.81,which is 
"1,",
25-dihydroxyvitamin,D
3.,
5342.13,And there's a variety of different SNPs that show. 
5345.59,So you're not looking at vitamin D levels at all. 
5347.68,You're looking at just the SNPs. 
5348.9,"And you know, if they have it, they have low vitamin D. "
5351.51,So it's really a way of doing 
5354.48,a beautifully randomized controlled trial 
5357.34,with an observational study because you're not biased. 
5362.24,Vitamin D levels are also associated with health. 
5364.48,People that have higher vitamin D 
5366.43,"are either outside more, "
5367.263,"they're more physically active, "
5368.69,or they're aware of their health 
5370.39,"and their supplementing, right? "
5371.43,So you always have to worry about that 
5373.56,when you're doing an observational study. 
5375.72,"Dealing in randomization is beautiful for that reason, "
5377.73,where you're now just random. 
5379.41,"People randomly have these genes, "
5381.34,and there's no health status. 
5383.88,"If you have the SNP, like your friend, "
5385.63,like your family member was healthy and all. 
5387.84,"They were healthy, "
5388.673,"and yet they couldn't get their D levels up, right? "
5390.69,So these Mendelian randomization studies have found 
5393.63,"that people that can't convert into the precursor, "
5397.95,the 
25-hydroxy,"vitamin D, which is usually what's measured. "
5400.38,It's the most stable form of vitamin D in the body. 
5403.5,"They have a higher all-cause mortality, if they can't do it. "
5406.24,So people that don't have it 
5408.01,have a lower all-cause mortality. 
5409.54,They have a higher respiratory-related mortality. 
5412.89,They have a higher cancer-related mortality. 
5415.11,"So, to me... Now, why did I get on this rant? "
5419.19,"Oh, because your family member. "
5421.07,"So, basically, they also are more likely "
5423.44,to get multiple sclerosis. 
5424.46,This has all been done with Mendelian randomization. 
5426.501,And so it really does hammer home the importance 
5429.55,of measuring your vitamin D levels 
5431.67,and being very proactive about that. 
5434.643,"I mean, you can get it done anywhere. "
5436.77,"Your doctor will do it. You ask 'em to do it, you know. "
5439.13,"So supplementation wise, "
5441.66,"typically, if you don't have one of those SNPs, "
5444.21,"for the most part, taking "
"1,",
000,IUs of vitamin D 
5447.84,will raise blood levels 
5449.43,by around five nanograms per milliliter. 
5451.96,"So let's say you're deficient, "
5453.15,you're 
20,"nanograms per milliliter, "
5455.18,and you want to get to 
40.,
5457.03,You're going to need at least 
"4,",
000,"IUs, "
5458.99,if you are normal and don't have any of these SNPs 
5462.55,"that change your metabolism of vitamin D, right? "
5464.39,"- Does it matter when you take it relative to sun exposure, "
5468.2,"time of day, with or without food? "
5471.12,- I've seen some not so great preliminary evidence 
5475.83,suggesting maybe time of day is important. 
5478.87,I don't think it. 
5480.1,"Like, I can't seem to find anything that really suggests. "
5484.753,"Because for it to actually be converted into the hormone, "
5487.26,"I mean, it's stored. "
5488.755,- It's slow-acting. 
5489.588,These steroid hormones are slow-acting. 
5491.04,"- Yeah, it's not like immediate thing. "
5493.01,"So maybe we'll get some new data that's like otherwise, "
5496.98,"but I just don't, yeah. "
5498.43,- It simplifies the problem anyway. 
5500.26,"So, for people who are going to be stubborn "
5502.49,and not get their D
3,"levels tested or their D levels tested, "
5506.22,"and simply say, ""Oh, I'll just take some D"
"3.""",
5510.84,"That was me, by the way, until I got tested. "
5515.04,I threw 
"5,",
000,"IUs into the mix and figured, "
5517.36,"well, it's not going to kill me. "
5518.26,It'll bring my vitamin D levels up. 
5520.14,"I realize that's a bit of a coarse way to approach it, "
5523.48,"but I feel fine, and I'm still breathing and ambulatory. "
5526.71,"So, is that reasonable? "
5529.373,
"1,",
000,to 
"5,",
000,IUs for most people will be reasonably safe. 
5532.6,"Again, just assuming that people are going to just jump to it "
5536.49,without the blood test. 
5537.84,"- Of course, I think that, if we look at the literature, "
5542.81,"the scientific literature, "
5544.5,"it is extremely hard to get hypercalcemia, "
5547.84,which would be the major concern 
5549.21,with really high levels of vitamin D
3,supplementation. 
5552.35,"I mean, we're talking like hundreds of thousands "
5554.81,of IU a day for a long time. 
5558.204,"- Hundreds of thousands. - Yes, yes. "
5560.7,"Now, the upper tolerable intake was set "
5563.44,by the Medicine Institute to be 
"4,",
000.,
5568.551,It was kind of like one of those things where it's safe. 
5572.301,I personally take 
"5,",
000,"IUs a day as well, "
5575.725,and my levels really hover around 
50,nanograms per mill. 
5581.486,I don't put sunscreen on all the time. 
5584.69,"I do put it on my face and I wear a hat, "
5585.897,"but some of my skin is being exposed, "
5587.6,so I do make it from the sun as well. 
5590.85,- I'm glad you brought up the fact 
5593.26,that you keep arms exposed. 
5595.27,"Because, in these studies that I mentioned before, "
5598.33,looking at sun exposure on skin 
5600.28,"and increases in other hormones, "
5602.49,"testosterone, estrogen, mainly, "
5604.34,it became clear from looking at those data 
5606.82,"that the amount of skin that you expose is important, "
5609.98,"which makes perfect sense once you hear that, "
5611.68,"but I think most people are thinking, "
5612.59,"oh, I'm out in the sun, "
5614.24,"but are you wearing shorts and a t-shirt, "
5617.05,or are you wearing a sweatshirt and it's a hoodie? 
5619.759,Are you all covered up out in the sun? 
5621.47,"Well, that might be great for setting your circadian rhythm "
5623.64,by way of light through the eyes 
5625.46,'cause that's the primary mechanism for that. 
5627.36,But seems to me that the more of your body surface 
5631.06,"that you can safely and appropriately, "
5634.17,"please, folks, "
5635.003,"appropriately expose to the sun, "
5637.32,the more vitamin D you're going to create. 
5639.67,So laying out on your back deck in shorts and a t-shirt 
5643.81,with arms exposed and legs exposed 
5645.37,is a very different stimulus 
5647.41,than walking around in jeans and a sweatshirt. 
5650.2,"- Absolutely. - Right? Okay, okay. "
5652.4,Especially if you have sunscreen on your face. 
5653.87,"I know it almost seems like trivially simple, "
5656.02,but I'm not sure that people are used to thinking 
5657.75,about their skin as a interface to create these hormones. 
5662.41,- Yeah. - So surface area matters. 
5664.45,"- And by the way, there have been studies looking at people "
5669.05,that are deficient in vitamin D. 
5671.45,"In this case, it was African Americans "
5673.33,that were given a 
"4,",
000,IU a day vitamin D supplement 
5676.5,to bring them back to sufficient levels. 
5679.89,"This was a smaller study than I would like, "
5683.33,but it reversed their epigenetic aging by three years. 
5687.919,"Because, again, it's a hormone. "
5691.15,It's regulating more than 
5%,
5692.53,of your protein-encoding human genome. 
5695.181,There's been studies looking 
5696.52,at vitamin D receptor knockout mice. 
5699.75,And I use this a lot in my presentations 
5701.68,when I'm talking about vitamin D and longevity. 
5704.48,"If you look at these animals, "
5705.76,"the vitamin D receptor, as I mentioned earlier, "
5708.7,"vitamin D binds to the receptor, "
5710.48,"and then it complexes with the retinoid receptor, "
5712.53,and they go into the nucleus as a complex 
5714.05,and turn on and turn off genes. 
5716.12,"Well, if you get rid of that receptor, "
5717.41,"which is what you can do in animal studies, "
5720.439,you can determine what effects there will be 
5723.57,with no vitamin D. 
5724.79,"Like, how do you study no vitamin D? "
5726.767,"And so what was found was that these animals, "
5730.94,"and, in fact, I don't think it was a complete knockout "
5734.04,"'cause I think it might be embryonic lethal, but- "
5736.243,- [Andrew] Some hypomorph. - Yes. 
5737.69,- Which is basically geek speak for a gene 
5740.36,"is vastly reduced in its function, number and function, "
5744.76,"number, people know what I mean, "
5746.29,but isn't eliminated completely. 
5748.89,"- Right, well, these animals, "
5750.37,"if you look at them after the age of four months, "
5753.45,"I mean, the mice look like. "
5756.5,"I mean, they're accelerated aging. "
5758.23,They're wrinkled. They have no hair. 
5761.1,Their lifespan's shorter. 
5762.53,"I mean, you can look at this animal "
5764.54,and not know anything about mice or work with them 
5766.283,"and be like, ""That animal looks like it's..."" "
5770.14,"Of course, mice lifespans are only like two, "
5772.078,"two and a half years, but, like, "
500,years old. 
5774.86,- Looks like it went to graduate school twice. 
5776.85,- [Rhonda] Yeah. 
5777.7,"- Actually, graduate school's a lot of fun. "
5779.21,"I like to think I aged backwards in graduate school, "
5781.11,which is not true. 
5781.943,I look at the photos. I definitely aged forward. 
5784.18,"You, on the other hand, "
5785.013,look exactly the same way you did 
10,years ago. 
5787.25,"I'm not saying that to flatter you, "
5788.65,but it's absolutely true. 
5789.7,"I mean, the data or the data. It's remarkable. "
5792.34,So I'm definitely going to try 
5794.33,and get my omega-
3,percentage up there. 
5796.55,"I'm not going to hinge it all on that, "
5798.57,but clearly you're doing a lot of things right. 
5801.93,"So, if I'm taking vitamin D"
"3,",
5805.97,I still need to get out into the sun. 
5807.97,Correct? - Absolutely. 
5808.803,"- Okay, I think a lot of people don't know that, "
5810.88,"or, at least, I have family members "
5812.21,that have been a little bit resistant. 
5813.39,"Like, ""I take my vitamin D "
5814.327,"""so I don't need to get outside as much."" "
5816.44,I think people are really afraid of getting out into the sun 
5818.69,because they're worried about melanomas. 
5820.76,"And, to be honest, I'm as scared of sunscreen "
5824.9,as I am of melanoma. 
5826.51,"Some of the things in sunscreen are really spooky, "
5829.46,mainly the compound. 
5830.85,"And here, I'm not one of these conspiracy. "
5832.62,"I drink tap water. Listen, folks. "
5834.52,"People cringe, but I drink tap water. "
5836.95,I have the occasional croissant or donut. 
5840.134,
"90%,",
80%,"of the time, "
5841.7,"I'm doing the right things, the right way, I think. "
5843.6,"Although, I'm now going to improve on them "
5844.93,with this new knowledge. 
5847.814,But I don't like what I see in most sunscreens. 
5850.87,"Because, if you look at these compounds, "
5852.85,they cross the blood-brain barrier. 
5855.06,I don't want compounds crossing the blood-brain barrier. 
5858.34,- Titanium dioxide? 
5859.22,"- Dioxide, some of the triclosans "
5860.96,that are also in these cleansers. 
5862.68,"I mean, once you know a little bit about neurons, "
5866.41,"folks, you realize the neurons you got "
5868.24,are basically the ones you've got for your entire life. 
5871.17,"There's a reason why there's a blood-brain barrier, "
5872.77,"a blood-ovary, and a blood-testes barrier. "
5875.01,It's because the genetic material resides 
5876.64,"in the testes, the ovaries, and the brain. "
5878.38,Those neurons don't turn over. 
5879.5,There are a few new neurons 
5880.6,"but not that many unless you're a mouse, frankly. "
5883.49,"And so protecting those is very key, "
5885.26,and a lot of the things in sunscreen 
5888.41,are downright dangerous. 
5890.08,"So I think there are sunscreens that are safe, "
5892.66,but it's very hard to figure out 
5894.73,which sunscreens are free of these compounds. 
5897.87,"I'm amazed that they're still on the market, frankly. "
5900.53,- I've always geared towards the ones with the minerals 
5904.75,that are reflecting it. 
5906.596,It is somewhat difficult to penetrate things 
5909.61,"all the way through the skin and get into the bloodstream, "
5913.37,but I don't know. 
5914.203,Maybe some of these compounds get in there easily. 
5915.82,I have seen the evidence with some of those things. 
5918.32,"- Yeah, there is some evidence they go transdermal. "
5921.67,- And they get in. 
5922.503,"Okay, well, I know that some of them react with the sun "
5925.84,"and, while they do protect from the UVA and/or B, "
5929.11,they form massive reactive oxygen species and carcinogen. 
5933.16,"I mean, it's like the very thing you're trying "
5934.63,to protect yourself from might actually cause- 
5937.81,- [Andrew] Right. 
5938.643,- We don't know. It's completely speculation. 
5942.34,"There is, I think, some more and more evidence coming out "
5944.65,with some of those compounds. 
5945.86,"I can't remember all of 'em off the top of my head, "
5948.26,but a lot of high-end ones also have. 
5952.06,It's the chemical sunscreen ones. 
5953.655,"- Right, right. - [Rhonda] The chemical ones. "
5955.62,- I'm proposing that we do a journal club. 
5957.36,"A journal club, folks, is where academics get together. "
5959.57,"Well, they read papers, then they get together, "
5961.96,and they pick apart the papers. 
5963.67,There's a strong correlation 
5965.25,between being an early graduate student 
5967.11,and being the most critical. 
5968.2,"'Cause once you've actually published some papers, "
5969.63,"you realize that, most studies, people are doing their best "
5973.34,within the context of what they can do. 
5974.98,But it'd be great to do a journal club 
5976.52,at some point about sunscreens 
5978.88,'cause I'd love to really figure out 
5980.19,what's in these compounds. 
5981.66,People are using them like crazy. 
5983.14,"And I'm not one of these people who's like, "
5984.48,"oh, I won't use commercial toothpaste "
5986.17,or anything like that. 
5987.93,"Like I said, I drink tap water. "
5989.24,"I use commercial toothpaste, whatever. "
5990.8,"But when it comes to sunscreen, it freaks me out "
5992.7,because some of these compounds do go transdermal 
5995.74,"and some of them cross the blood-brain barrier, "
5997.93,and I'd like to keep my neurons free of that stuff. 
6000.77,"Anyway, we're speculating now. "
6002.515,"- Wear a hat. - Wear a hat, "
6004.96,but get out in the sun and get your D
3,levels up. 
6008.12,"Okay, so, we talked about these plant-based compounds, "
6010.65,the omega-
"3s,",and D
3.,
6013.27,Unless there's something else 
6014.49,"that you just absolutely must throw into the mix, "
6018.22,I probably will return us to the conversation 
6021.07,"that I opened up with, which was about cold and heat, "
6023.12,"which, admittedly, I pulled us off that path, "
6025.9,so I take full responsibility for that. 
6028.37,"But before I do that, "
6029.79,I just want to offer you the opportunity. 
6033.3,Is there anything to supplement-based 
6036.72,or food-based compounds that you think are especially useful 
6042.21,for brain and/or body health? 
6043.323,- I do think magnesium is important in there as well. 
6046.569,"I mean, I think, again, about "
40%,of the US population 
6051.01,doesn't get enough magnesium. 
6052.55,It's an essential mineral 
6054.43,we're supposed to be getting from our diet. 
6056.359,- Involved in everything. 
6057.353,- It is. It's also involved in vitamin D metabolism. 
6061.29,"And, in fact, being deficient in magnesium "
6064.41,may make it more difficult 
6065.99,"for you to actually make vitamin D hormone, "
6069.73,so that 
"1,",
25-dihyroxyvitamin,D. 
6072.02,"So one of those other factors, again, "
6074.25,"we talked about genetics, "
6075.5,but there's also magnesium status as well. 
6077.65,Considering 
"40%,",that's a big number. 
6080.67,"Now, magnesium's also involved in making ATP, "
6086.26,the energetic currency of our cells. 
6089.36,"Basically, all of our cells need ATP to do anything. "
6093.02,It's also involved in utilizing ATP 
6095.25,as well as DNA repair enzymes. 
6096.88,These are enzymes that are involved 
6098.11,in repairing damage to our DNA. 
6099.98,I personally think that magnesium insufficiency 
6105.395,causes an insidious type of damage daily 
6108.22,that you can't look in the mirror and see. 
6110.62,"When you're deficient in vitamin C, "
6113.21,"you're like, ""My gums are falling apart. "
6115.337,"""I have scurvy, right?"" "
6116.6,But you can't see DNA damage. 
6118.52,"You can't see it, but it's happening. "
6119.6,"It's happening right now in my body, "
6120.637,and it's happening in your body. 
6121.72,It's happening. Normal metabolism is happening every day. 
6125.69,But we repair that damage. 
6127.1,We have repair enzymes in our body 
6129.18,called DNA repair enzymes. 
6130.81,They require magnesium. 
6132.22,Magnesium is a co-factor for them. 
6135.2,"What that means, a co-factor means, "
6137.37,"enzymes need it to function properly, "
6139.64,"and so, without that co-factor, "
6142.68,they're not doing it properly. 
6145.33,The way I like to think about magnesium. It's easy. 
6147.66,"'Cause people go, ""What food should I eat?"" "
6149.23,"Naturally, that's the next question. "
6150.74,"Well, magnesium is at the center of a chlorophyll molecule. "
6154.13,Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. 
6156.69,"So dark, leafy greens are high in magnesium. "
6161.682,"Basically, what does the "
40%,
6164.169,insufficiency in the US tell us? 
6166.6,People aren't eating their greens. 
6167.79,They're not eating their greens. 
6168.73,They're eating their packaged food. 
6169.74,They're eating their processed food. 
6170.573,The standard American diet isn't really high 
6172.44,"in dark, leafy greens. "
6174.172,"So dark, leafy greens are how I like to get my magnesium. "
6177.573,I think it comes along with all these other important. 
6180.62,"I mean, you get calcium in them. You get vitamin K"
1.,
6183.71,"You're getting a lot of other micronutrients, "
6185.26,"and you're getting other compounds that we don't know about, "
6187.59,"and ones that we know about, like sulforaphane, right? "
6192.37,"- As with broccoli, "
6194.61,"do I need to eat the dark, leafy greens raw? "
6198.05,"And, in this case, I'm a little more open to it "
6199.91,"because I actually like the taste of, dare I say, kale. "
6202.67,"And kale's a dark, leafy green, right? "
6205.29,"- Yes, and it's high in lutein and zeaxanthin as well. "
6208.425,"- I'm a trichromat, meaning I'm not color blind, "
6210.43,but I just want to make sure it falls 
6211.99,under the strict category. 
6213.09,"'Cause every once in a while, I'm like, "
6214.027,"""Oh, I eat my vegetables."" "
6214.99,"I like avocados, "
6215.823,and people remind me avocados are not a vegetable. 
6217.72,I love vegetables also. 
6219.82,"So kale, what are some other examples? "
6222.1,"- Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard, rainbow chard, "
6225.9,romaine lettuce. 
6227.15,- Is the bitterness an important component to this? 
6229.327,"- For magnesium, no, but for sulforaphane, "
6233.69,for cruciferous vegetables. 
6234.8,That would be the brassica family. 
6238.68,But your question about cooking them. 
6242.02,"So magnesium, it is bound to the food matrix, "
6245.637,and it can be somewhat less bioavailable. 
6252.463,"So cooking it can somewhat release the magnesium, "
6257.14,but it goes into the water too. 
6258.89,So you have to either steam it 
6261.65,or kind of like get your water in. 
6264.63,- You can drink the water. 
6266.03,"- Yeah, I personally don't worry about it. "
6268.81,"- Okay, great. - [Rhonda] I just don't worry. "
6270.28,"- Well, if you don't worry, I'm not going to worry. "
6271.73,- But I also do supplement with magnesium. 
6274.29,"So supplementation with magnesium, "
6277.27,"I mean, we could go on and on. "
6279.15,Let's keep this short and sweet 
6280.77,because we're going to get back to the other stuff. 
6282.03,But it can cause GI distress at high doses. 
6285.76,I personally like to take around 
130,or 
135,milligrams. 
6291.02,"That way, it's not like a huge bolus to my gut. "
6293.88,- But I think it depends on the form of magnesium too. 
6295.86,"- Yes, yeah. "
6297.11,"I mean, you can take magnesium threonate, for example, "
6300.095,and it doesn't affect the gut as much. 
6304.59,- Magnesium citrate. 
6305.97,- Citrate is what I take. 
6308.82,- [Rhonda] I take Thorne. - It's a pretty potent 
6310.21,gut stimulus. 
6312.042,I feel like it's a little bit harder to digest. 
6314.44,- 
135,milligrams should be pretty good. 
6317.05,"And citrate, actually, "
6318.77,"oh boy, do we want to go here? "
6320.29,"- I mean, it's up to you. We don't have to. "
6324.11,"Personally, I've been supplementing with magnesium "
6325.88,for a long time. 
6328.26,I use threonate and bisglycinate 
6332.898,and malate for different reasons. 
6335.26,"So, yes, I would love to go there if you're willing. "
6337.81,"- I would say malate would be the best, "
6339.747,and that has to do with the short-chain fatty acids 
6342.43,being good for the gut and a lot of work done 
6344.21,"by a former colleague of mine and good friend, "
6345.84,"Mark Shigenaga, showing that the short-chain fatty acid, "
6348.38,"citrate, malate, lactate, "
6350.3,"but specifically malate, really, and lactate "
6352.763,are the major ones that get into the gut epithelial cells 
6356.81,and are an energy source for the mitochondria 
6358.61,"and the goblet cells, so anyways, "
6362.34,whole other topic. - That's okay. 
6364.31,I take malate because I was told that it would be helpful. 
6368.7,"First of all, it doesn't make me sleepy "
6370.24,"like some of the other forms of magnesium, "
6372.22,which act as a mild sedative for me. 
6375.85,"They do tap into the GABAergic pathway, "
6378.31,"a neurotransmitter, folks, "
6380.01,"that, in general, broad sweeping generalization here, "
6383.09,"can have somewhat of a sedative quality, "
6386.23,which is why I take magnesium threonate 
6388.91,"and/or bisglycinate before sleep, "
6390.85,
30,to 
60,minutes before sleep. 
6392.65,Definitely enhances my transition time to sleep 
6396.57,and the depth of sleep. 
6397.43,"No question, in my experience. "
6400.1,"There's some data that threonate can be neuroprotective, "
6404.12,although those studies are still ongoing. 
6406.82,I'm getting the sense that maybe you're 
6408.53,a little more skeptical of that than I am. 
6410.44,"- Yeah, no, I've seen the studies with the threonate. "
6413.74,"I think, looking at the actual data "
6416.1,"from the one clinical study, "
6419.21,there wasn't statistical significance 
6421.14,"until all three of the pieces of data were pulled together, "
6424.81,but that really could just be because their sample size 
6426.63,"was too small, right? "
6427.92,"- Yeah, I'm thinking that paired with the, "
6429.91,there's some work- - [Rhonda] The animal stuff. 
6430.743,"- Yeah, Guosong Liu's work on. "
6434.51,This is getting kind of inside ball of neuroscience. 
6437.63,"The quality of the labs matters, folks, "
6440.1,and that's something that's not accessible 
6441.61,to people outside of fields. 
6443.578,"Guosong Liu and some of the other folks at that time at MIT, "
6447.01,I think very highly of their work. 
6449.42,"And so the animal studies are indeed just animal studies, "
6452.55,but I was pretty impressed 
6453.68,by what they did in those studies. 
6455.24,Very pioneering when you think about this being done 
6458.012,
"10,",
"12,",
15,years ago. 
6460.29,"And then, yes, we need more human clinical data. "
6462.84,"But, for me, I figured that, given the safety profile "
6466.33,"of mag threonate, given that it helps me sleep better, "
6468.62,"and sleeping better is just better for everything, frankly. "
6472.83,That's why I take it. 
6473.663,And bisglycinate and threonate 
6474.96,"seem to be somewhat interchangeable, "
6477.02,but I don't know of any reports 
6478.93,that bisglycinate can be neuroprotective. 
6481.01,But malate I take during the daytime. 
6484.34,"For me, and, again, this is subjective, "
6486.03,it has a tangible effect 
6487.61,in improving the recovery time from exercise. 
6491.19,I don't know that I've been sore from a workout 
6493.35,"since I started taking malate, "
6494.84,and I used to get very sore 
6497.0,from even kind of trivial workouts. 
6499.37,"So I don't know what's going on there, but I keep taking it. "
6502.4,"- Malate, again, the short-chain fatty acid, "
6504.91,"and when you do intense exercise, "
6508.89,you release endotoxin from your gut. 
6511.341,I'm just going back to the interesting work 
6513.603,'cause the malate being the short-chain fatty acid 
6515.93,"and Mark Shigenaga showing, "
6518.81,"this is all an animal research by the way, "
6521.347,but it was feeding these animals malate. 
6524.15,"It really protected the gut, endotoxin release, "
6526.51,and it affected metabolic syndrome and all sorts of things. 
6529.603,"But I think malates awesome, "
6530.497,and I always try to eat green apples. 
6532.65,They're really high in malic acid. 
6534.01,"- [Andrew] Oh, good to know. - And tart cherries. "
6536.3,Tart cherries are really high in it as well. 
6537.91,- They also taste really good. 
6539.027,- But I was really interested 
6539.957,in the magnesium threonate stuff. 
6541.7,I take a supplement called Magnesi-Om by Moon Juice. 
6545.73,And it's like a little powder. 
6547.76,"It's got a little bit of monk fruit, but it tastes good. "
6549.94,So I do it a little bit before bedtime as well. 
6553.22,Probably several more hours though 
6554.84,because I don't like to drink tons and tons of fluids 
6556.81,before I go to bed. 
6557.643,"And it has magnesium threonate, "
6559.347,"and a variety of other versions of magnesium in it as well, "
6562.97,and I really like it. 
6564.01,But I thought the magnesium threonate stuff 
6565.9,was super interesting. 
6567.46,"I would love to see more clinical data as well, "
6569.46,"but I think, once we get it, it'll probably be like, "
6571.94,"oh yeah, it's getting into the brain, and it's awesome, "
6573.75,"so, you know, why wait? "
6576.182,"- And along those lines, "
6577.37,"I once put out a post that said, "
6580.52,I feel like there are a number of different categories 
6582.32,of health information consumers online 
6585.55,and understanding which one you're in for which topic 
6588.13,can alleviate a lot of the strain and stress 
6589.89,of finding the information. 
6590.89,There's some people that are perfectly comfortable 
6592.94,with data from a mouse study. 
6594.1,"It's like, ""If it's done in mice, great. I'll try it."" "
6596.38,"Other people say, ""No, it has to be done in humans."" "
6599.18,"Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. "
6601.33,"Randomized clinical trials, et cetera. "
6604.04,"Then, other people just say, ""You know what? "
6605.557,"""I don't even care about any of that. "
6606.777,"""Just tell me what you do."" "
6608.5,"And then, other people say, ""You know what? "
6609.527,"""I don't even care what you do. Just tell me what to do."" "
6612.05,"And then, there's this other category "
6613.72,"which are, if it's in pill form or powder form, "
6615.69,they'll take it. 
6616.62,And so I think a lot of the battles 
6618.41,of people picking apart people's posts and things 
6620.96,have to do with the fact that people don't realize 
6623.51,that people are showing up to the table 
6626.67,in one or some combination of those stances. 
6629.92,"We know people that will try anything, "
6631.38,and we know people that won't take anything. 
6633.22,So the idea here is to create an array of possibilities 
6638.27,"for people, and I think the animal data are very impressive. "
6641.86,We should have you back on to talk- 
6642.98,"- I take it with the hope of, "
6644.33,because I feel like the animal data 
6645.82,"is very promising. - Right, there you go. "
6647.526,"- And so I'm like, it probably is, so why not? "
6649.97,"- Well, and obviously you're doing things right. "
6653.41,So cold and heat 
6657.54,converge on some common pathways 
6659.19,"related to what you called intermittent challenge, "
6662.21,which I love. 
6663.07,"I think, intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, "
6668.05,"I mean, maybe even intermittent sleep deprivation. "
6670.04,I keep waiting for the intermittent 
6671.1,sleep deprivation movement. 
6672.15,"I will say, I pull a few all-nighters per year "
6675.13,just for work demands and procrastination and deadlines. 
6679.933,I'm the worst combination of academic 
6682.11,"'cause I'm both a procrastinator and a perfectionist, "
6684.65,so you end up pulling some all-nighters. 
6686.85,The sleep I get the next night is pretty amazing. 
6689.75,"I must say, it's the sleep of gods, "
6691.76,but I don't recommend anyone use sleep deprivation for that. 
6694.01,But I could imagine that we also evolved 
6695.95,having some sleepless nights. 
6697.9,So this idea of intermittent challenge 
6700.1,"is a really attractive one, "
6701.0,and I want to make sure that we credit you 
6702.34,with the phrase intermittent challenge. 
6704.1,"- No, credit Dr. Mark Mattson. "
6705.71,- Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. 
6707.415,"- Who's published, "
6708.248,and he has used that- - He used those words. 
6709.14,"- Oh, that phrase. - Yes. "
6709.973,"- Okay, great. We'll make sure. "
6710.92,"- Just like Dr. David Sinclair, "
6712.75,I love the xenohormesis. 
6713.583,"It was in one of his publications so many years ago, "
6716.44,and I just love it. 
6717.9,Brilliant. A brilliant term. 
6718.98,So Mark Mattson gets credit. - Those Harvard guys 
6720.94,are pretty smart. 
6722.906,"I mean, it's a good school, I guess. "
6725.7,Of course it's a good school. 
6727.75,We will credit the appropriate people. 
6729.44,Thank you for that clarification. 
6731.36,So you've talked a lot about the use 
6735.6,"of what I call deliberate cold exposure, "
6737.9,only to distinguish it from cold 
6739.79,"that you might just be accidentally exposed to, "
6741.58,but it's sort of obvious when we say cold exposure. 
6744.73,There are some amazing data on cold. 
6747.41,"The other day I saw a post from you, "
6749.16,and you've included this in talks before. 
6750.75,"I did not know this until I learned it from you, "
6752.83,"so credit to you, "
6753.95,that even 
20,"seconds of immersion in, "
6758.34,"I think, it was four degree. "
6759.75,- 
49,degree Fahrenheit. 
6761.153,- 
49,degree Fahrenheit. 
6762.263,"Okay, I was translating to Celsius, "
6763.85,but 
49,"degree Fahrenheit water, so cold water, "
6766.66,can lead to long-lasting increases 
6768.35,"in epinephrine, adrenaline, "
6770.97,and I have to presume other neuromodulators 
6774.47,and neurochemicals as well. 
6776.75,What are some cold protocols 
6778.9,that you find particularly interesting or attractive 
6782.51,"from the standpoint of, I dunno, pick your favorite, "
6786.07,"metabolism, neuro/mood effects, "
6791.59,"brown fat stimulation, "
6792.89,"which, of course, weaves back to metabolism. "
6795.764,"We could do an entire episode all about cold, "
6797.91,"but what I'd love to know is, "
6799.667,what sort of activity or stimulus do you think 
6803.6,is a reasonable and particularly potent one 
6806.95,to use in terms of cold? 
6808.96,"- So, today, I did three minutes at "
49,degrees Fahrenheit. 
6812.61,I have a cold tub. 
6813.84,- So you get in up to your neck? 
6815.34,"- Well, I try. I keep floating up. "
6818.83,It's like really hard. 
6821.281,I would say maybe most of my shoulder. 
6825.55,"I mean, really I'm floating up. "
6826.917,I was telling my husband. 
6828.54,"I was like, ""There's too much water in here for me."" "
6830.29,- Or too much salt in there? 
6831.123,Is it like the Dead Sea where you float on top? 
6833.72,- Is there salt in there? I don't know. 
6834.81,"He takes care of all the stuff that, you know. "
6837.383,It's the Plunge. 
6840.68,"- By the way, the podcast nor I am sponsored by Plunge. "
6843.08,They did give me one. That thing is fantastic. 
6845.11,"Also, 'cause it circulates the water. "
6846.665,- It does. 
6847.498,"- Which makes sure that you break up the thermal layer, "
6848.52,and it's even colder. 
6849.6,- It is even colder. It sucks! 
6851.51,"Anyways, so look, "
6853.402,I'll be honest here. 
6857.23,I wish I did more cold than I do. 
6859.06,I do cold when I'm going to go on a podcast. 
6861.57,"I definitely do cold when I'm going to do a podcast, "
6864.08,when I'm going to give a talk or when I'm anxious. 
6866.8,I need to make it more of a ritual. 
6868.93,I love doing the sauna. I hate the cold. 
6871.58,"I hate it, unless it's summertime. "
6873.23,It's a lot easier for me to get in the cold 
6874.38,in the summertime. 
6875.38,But what I do love about the cold is how I feel after. 
6880.66,And I feel less anxious. 
6884.4,I feel good. 
6885.9,"I feel more focused, which is why I'll usually do it "
6888.33,"before any type of public speaking, "
6891.43,"or when I'm just anxious, I'll just get in there. "
6895.373,And so the 
20,seconds at 
49,"degrees, "
6899.05,I think it was 
49,degrees Fahrenheit 
6901.02,"was really a good number because time and temperature, "
6906.28,"time, or duration, I guess, would be a better word, "
6909.09,"and temperature do matter, "
6911.13,but you can do 
20,"seconds at a colder temperature, "
6916.3,"which is I prefer, "
6917.19,or you can do a minute or longer at a warmer temperature. 
6921.01,I think there was another study 
6922.78,showing 
59,degrees Fahrenheit at one hour 
6925.79,"was like two to three, but who wants to do one hour "
6928.24,at 
59?,"- Yeah, I'm familiar "
6929.073,with that study. 
6930.743,So this really reveals just how absolutely nerdy I am 
6934.89,and maybe why some times and relationships 
6937.22,in my life were challenged. 
6938.2,I love reading the method sections of papers. 
6941.07,So people can come at me with a number of things 
6943.18,"about papers, and I might miss something. "
6945.51,"Surely I miss certain things, like anybody does, "
6947.83,"but the methods I relish in reading the methods, "
6951.32,and that paper is really interesting 
6952.65,'cause they had people sit in lawn chairs basically 
6955.62,in swimming pools for an hour. 
6959.57,It was chilly. It wasn't super cold. 
6961.5,I mean 
60,is not. 
6963.2,"It's not warm, but it's not ice-cold obviously. "
6966.01,But an hour is ridiculous at some level. 
6969.02,But the increases in dopamine were massive and lasted hours. 
6973.95,"So the mood enhancing effects that you report, "
6979.39,you're not imagining that. 
6980.63,Those are almost certainly a consequence 
6984.29,of having slowly elevating 
6986.13,but significantly elevated dopamine that goes on for hours. 
6989.63,That's almost a dreamlike profile for dopamine. 
6992.8,"Because most everything else, like an Adderall or Ritalin, "
6995.59,"a cup of coffee and a pre-workout drink or something, "
6999.8,is going to give you a big spike in adrenaline and dopamine 
7001.807,and a big crash. 
7003.68,"And somehow, it creates this really nice, contoured profile. "
7007.94,So whatever you're experiencing there 
7009.94,is very nicely supported by the data. 
7012.47,"- Well, I need to get doing it more. "
7014.927,I've had a couple of scary experiences 
7017.59,going from hot to cold. 
7019.93,- Can you explain? 
7021.55,"- Blood pressure changes, I think, "
7022.91,where I basically went straight from a really hot jacuzzi. 
7026.825,I was in there for like 
30,minutes. 
7028.82,"I was doing heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. "
7030.55,"- Yeah, "
104,degrees Fahrenheit. 
7032.71,- [Andrew] That's toasty. 
7034.12,- For 
30,"minutes, and then I went straight into, "
7036.71,"at the time, it was our pool, "
7038.9,"it was in February, it was wintertime, and it was "
50.,
7043.287,It was in the 
50s.,It was cold. 
7046.076,"And I was in there, "
7047.9,"and I was listening to Simon and Garfunkel, "
7049.71,"I was trying to stay in a long time, get on my cold, "
7051.63,and I was trying to impress Dan 
7052.49,'cause he'll stay in there for like 
15,minutes. 
7056.142,- [Andrew] Wow. 
7057.31,"- But I started to feel really blinkey, "
7060.58,"like low blood pressure or something, "
7062.11,"and I got scared, so I got out, "
7063.88,"and then I couldn't stand, like I had vertigo or something, "
7067.2,and I was so scared. 
7068.47,I was so scared. 
7070.43,And I've had a couple of times too 
7072.81,"where just going straight from the sauna to it, "
7075.449,"to the Cold Plunge, where I'm starting to feel, I'm like, "
7078.13,"ooh, I feel a little blood pressure change or something. "
7080.63,It makes sense. 
7081.49,The sauna is causing vasodilation and the Cold Plunge 
7086.38,"or cold exposure is causing vasoconstriction, "
7089.401,so it's like a very just shock to my system. 
7092.777,"And so, now, I wait. "
7094.73,I wait like a few minutes before going in. 
7097.08,But I do need to kind of like make the cold more routine. 
7100.5,Because I talk all about the science. 
7102.23,"I'm familiar with all the science, "
7104.117,"and the norepinephrine or noradrenaline, "
7107.18,it's affecting brain and mood. 
7110.33,You know way more about that than I do. 
7111.93,"I know how I feel, "
7112.83,"and I know it's a neurotransmitter, "
7114.69,"and it is released, at least, in rats, they've shown. "
7118.76,Or was it mice? I think it might've been rats. 
7120.33,But multiple studies showing that it's released 
7122.86,from the cold in the brain. 
7124.54,"- And now, in humans as well. "
7125.947,"- Oh, in the brain, they've shown. "
7126.934,"- So, in that study, we could put a link to this, "
7129.33,it's published in 
2000,"in European Journal of Physiology, "
7132.73,that big dopamine increase. 
7133.9,They also looked at epinephrine and cortisol 
7135.96,and saw some really. 
7137.08,"Yeah, so this has been done. - They did brain. Oh- "
7139.15,"- [Andrew] Oh, no, no- - The plasma, yeah. "
7140.437,"Yes, plasma. - Very hard to measure "
7142.76,dopamine directly from the brain 
7143.86,unless you're doing microdialysis. 
7145.09,"No, unfortunately, "
7147.0,"unfortunately, their skulls were intact. "
7148.47,"Fortunately, for them, "
7149.6,"unfortunately, for the research community, "
7151.03,"their skulls were intact, "
7152.06,so they couldn't measure directly in the brain. 
7153.96,"But obviously, there's a correlate there. "
7159.1,It's a very real effect. 
7162.46,But the advantage of not doing it too often 
7165.36,is that you're not cold adapted. 
7167.3,"Now, it's very hard for anyone to get truly cold adapted. "
7170.49,Some people start to look forward to the cold. 
7172.49,And what I think they're looking forward to 
7173.85,"is the feeling afterward, that dopamine rush. "
7177.6,"But, if you get cold adapted, "
7179.64,then it certainly blunts some of the effect. 
7182.83,- But I want to be cold adapted 
7184.37,because that means I have more mitochondria 
7186.93,in my adipose tissue and perhaps even muscle. 
7190.69,That's been shown. 
7191.96,"- So maybe there's a good opportunity to, "
7194.19,so cold and UCP
"1,",if you could educate us on UCP
1.,
7197.38,"I find this really interesting, "
7198.213,and I learned about it from you. 
7199.82,"- Yeah, well, so norepinephrine "
7202.21,actually released in the plasma. 
7203.53,It does act as a hormone. 
7205.607,"Vasoconstriction is one thing it does, "
7206.96,but it also regulates a variety of molecular functions 
7210.96,"that have to do with adaption to cold, "
7213.87,"one happening to be, "
7216.54,"shivering is a very inefficient way to produce heat, "
7219.73,which is what your body's trying to do 
7220.79,"when it's exposed to cold, "
7222.2,and your muscles are basically contracting 
7224.34,"and producing heat from that, "
7226.96,but that's just not very efficient. 
7228.38,"So the more eloquent way to do it, "
7231.21,"or elegant, I guess, way to do it "
7233.12,is to basically have your mitochondria 
7236.7,produce tons and tons of heat. 
7238.67,So the way it does this is by activating a gene 
7241.83,called UCP
"1,",uncoupling protein 
1.,
7244.83,"Norepinephrine is upstream of that, activating it. "
7248.298,"What that does is, essentially, "
7249.75,so mitochondria are these little organelles 
7251.88,inside of your cells 
7253.17,that are responsible for producing energy. 
7255.35,"Usually, that's in the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP, "
7259.463,and that's what lets everything function 
7262.18,"inside of your body, "
7263.07,from your neurotransmitter production 
7264.42,"to your heart beating, et cetera. "
7267.07,"However, you can uncouple your mitochondria. "
7270.52,"Basically, your mitochondria, "
7272.72,"they're like a little battery, so they have, "
7275.29,"well, they have a double membrane, "
7276.48,"first of all, their structure, "
7277.41,"but they have a negative charge on the inside, "
7279.864,"and they have a positive charge on the inner membrane, "
7282.56,so in between the outer membrane and the inside part. 
7286.847,- Like a neuron. 
7287.68,"- Like a neuron, yeah. "
7288.737,"- [Andrew] Yeah, cool. - So I guess, "
7289.57,it's like a neuron. 
7290.403,"It's like a battery, negative and positive. "
7291.83,"Well, basically, you can uncouple that charge, "
7294.06,and so that positive charge proton 
7295.65,"start leaking out of the mitochondria, "
7297.047,and your mitochondria freak out. 
7298.99,So this is called uncoupling it. 
7302.73,"It's maximum respiration, as we call it. "
7305.26,They try to make as much energy. 
7307.36,"They're like, ""I got to get that proton back, "
7309.777,"""that gradient, electrochemical gradient."" "
7312.04,And so they just go insane. 
7315.12,"In this case, it's uncoupled energy, "
7316.7,"so the energy they're making is actually heat, not ATP, "
7321.53,"but you're essentially burning substrate, so who cares? "
7325.04,You're burning glucose. You're burning lipids. 
7327.84,You're basically burning things and making heat. 
7330.47,"And so that's what uncoupling does, "
7332.7,and that is a much more efficient way 
7334.58,of producing heat than shivering. 
7336.41,"So, as you become more adapted, "
7339.04,maybe the longer duration that you've stayed in the cold 
7342.36,"or the more times you've done it, "
7343.6,you'll no longer shiver anymore. 
7345.44,You will start to then just do this uncoupling type 
7348.04,"of thermogenesis, as it's called. "
7350.13,And another type of adaptation that occurs 
7353.3,is you actually produce more mitochondria 
7355.72,in your adipose tissue. 
7357.45,"And that actually happens, "
7359.57,"also regulated by norepinephrine or noradrenaline, "
7362.57,through a protein called PGC-
1alpha.,
7366.56,And what that protein does is it makes more mitochondria 
7371.63,in your adipose cell. 
7373.33,"So, per adipose cell, you're getting more mitochondria. "
7375.8,It's a beautiful way to basically make more heat. 
7379.7,"It's one of those things where it's like, "
7382.02,"your body's going, ""Okay, I'm going to be exposed "
7384.037,"""to this cold next time. "
7385.287,"""How can I make sure I don't die? "
7387.507,"""Oh, I can have more mitochondria, "
7389.348,"""and I'm going to make more heat."" "
7390.387,And so you're making more mitochondria 
7392.32,in your adipose tissue. 
7393.39,And this is often referred to as the browning of fat. 
7397.05,"And the reason for that is because, "
7398.45,"if you look under a microscope at a lipid droplet, "
7401.57,"basically, a fat cell, "
7404.79,"not a lipid droplet, adipocyte, "
7406.65,you'll find that it looks darker 
7409.54,because there's more mitochondria in there. 
7411.33,So it's referred to as browning fat. 
7415.54,"I don't want to get into the whole beige fat, brown. "
7417.68,"You know, there's this whole, "
7418.79,I'm sure you've had experts 
7419.81,"on that talk all about that. - No, not yet. "
7421.06,"I always think of white fat, beige fat, brown fat. "
7423.76,"And beige is kind of, "
7425.24,white can be converted into beige. 
7426.87,"- Right, and beige can take on "
7428.08,"thermogenic characteristics essentially, "
7430.19,and so you can activate beige fat so that it's thermogenic 
7433.967,in the sense that it's burning glucose and/or fatty acids 
7438.98,and producing heat. 
7441.326,"So the more you expose yourself to cold, "
7445.53,"the more you can brown your fat, so to speak, "
7448.45,"and therefore you can tolerate the cold for longer periods, "
7452.35,"which people do notice, "
7453.97,and you can then have the thermogenic qualities 
7457.53,of having more brown adipose tissue 
7459.75,"or beige, activated beige, adipose tissue. "
7463.48,"You'll get a lot of naysayers out there saying, "
7465.386,"""Oh, brown fat doesn't regulate metabolism at all."" "
7468.487,And the reality is there's thousands of researchers 
7471.17,trying to pill up brown fat and thermogenic. 
7475.24,They're trying to make it a pill 
7476.66,because it does affect metabolism. 
7479.18,It's not the only thing. 
7480.21,"It's certainly, if you're obese and trying to lose weight, "
7482.94,you're not going to do that just by doing cold exposure. 
7485.77,"You need to do dietary and exercise changes predominantly, "
7490.02,but it does affect metabolism. 
7492.49,"And this has been shown in human studies, "
7496.64,"so it is an interesting, "
7500.73,"it's another possible mechanism for affecting metabolism, "
7503.99,"and that's an adipose tissue, "
7505.95,but you also make more mitochondria and muscle tissue. 
7509.56,"And this is regulated, not via norepinephrine, "
7512.34,but it is still PGC-
"1alpha,","interestingly, "
7515.889,"not that anyone else really cares but me, "
7517.557,"and maybe you do, Andrew. "
7519.29,- I'm eating this up. 
7520.88,- So PGC-
1alpha,responds to norepinephrine 
7525.85,"in adipose tissue to make more mitochondria, "
7528.13,"but, in muscle tissue, it's unclear what the regulator is. "
7532.25,Cold exposure does it. 
7533.38,"So this was shown at least in a couple of studies I've seen, "
7537.65,"where people that were exercising, I believe, "
7540.48,"or maybe it may have been men only that were exercising, "
7543.08,"did some training, and then did cold water immersion, "
7546.335,something like 
50,"degrees Fahrenheit, "
15,"minutes, "
7549.41,and PGC-
"1alpha,",which is a biomarker 
7551.49,"for mitochondrial biogenesis, "
7552.93,which is the generation of new mitochondria. 
7555.25,"By the way, that's awesome. "
7556.66,You want more mitochondria in your muscle. 
7558.16,"It's associated with improved muscle mass, "
7561.07,improved endurance. 
7562.58,"Mitochondria are essentially, "
7564.47,they're making energy in your cell. 
7567.03,We don't make more mitochondria normally. 
7569.45,"You have certain inputs, "
7570.72,"high-intensity interval training, exercise can do it. "
7572.897,- Can actually make more mitochondria. 
7574.81,"- Yes, yeah, and that's been shown in people. "
7577.57,- Weight training or just high-intensity interval training? 
7580.5,- I haven't seen weight training. 
7583.3,"I've seen it in high-intensity interval training, "
7585.81,"endurance training, "
7587.36,"but that doesn't mean that it hasn't been shown, "
7589.42,"I just haven't seen it, or that it hasn't been looked at. "
7591.21,- That's good to know. 
7592.173,"I'm always looking for reasons to finally do more HIT type, "
7596.36,high-intensity interval training work. 
7597.64,"I do weight training, and I do low-intensity cardio. "
7600.4,"- There was a brilliant study by, "
7603.37,"at the time, he was a postdoc, Matthew Robinson, "
7605.88,and he's now gone on to start his own lab 
7609.86,at the University of Oregon Health Science Center. 
7613.49,"- [Andrew] Great place, yeah. "
7615.53,"- And he did a study where both young and older people, "
7620.81,"they had this whole high-intensity protocol, "
7622.44,"which I can't remember what it was, "
7623.75,but their protocol for X amount of time. 
7627.09,I'm sure it was at least a month. 
7629.8,They then measured biomarkers 
7631.93,"of mitochondrial biogenesis in their muscle tissue, "
7634.19,and the amount of mitochondrial biogenesis 
7637.55,"in old people specifically, "
7639.06,"it happened in both young and old from HIT, "
7640.82,"from the high-intensity interval training, "
7642.53,"was, I mean, it was enormous, "
7645.0,at least 
"50%,",I think. 
7647.0,"- [Andrew] Fantastic. - So it was just like, whoa! "
7649.04,"And so, why would you want that? "
7650.751,"Well, mitochondria, "
7654.238,your cells are turning over. 
7655.77,You make new cells. You replace old ones. 
7657.467,"With your mitochondria, "
7659.0,you don't really do that for the most part. 
7661.13,You can. 
7661.963,"Mitochondrial biogenesis does happen, "
7663.12,but you have to stimulate it to happen. 
7665.13,And what happens with your mitochondria 
7668.18,"is they essentially are bobbing around inside of your cells, "
7670.6,"and then they fuse with other mitochondria, "
7673.17,"exchange all their content, mitochondrial DNA, "
7675.66,and then fizz back apart. 
7676.53,And that's how they kind of stay young-ish. 
7678.78,"But, as you age, you keep doing that "
7680.773,"with the same pool of mitochondria, "
7682.63,then you're going to get a bunch of old mitochondria 
7684.24,"mixing old stuff together, right? "
7686.18,"So, why wouldn't you want to bring up new, healthy, "
7690.28,"young mitochondria into that pool, right? "
7693.44,"So, in my mind, when I hear mitochondrial biogenesis, "
7696.12,"I'm like, aging. "
7697.43,That's the first thing I think of. 
7699.2,"So, anyways, cold exposure does that. "
7701.65,"Other things as well, so. - Amazing. "
7703.12,"And please, thank you for offering "
7706.37,"to somehow filter the level of detail, "
7709.25,but I assure you that listeners of this podcast 
7712.13,"are familiar with drinking from the fire hose of mechanism, "
7716.11,and that was really helpful. 
7717.69,"And, again, this is just one example of maybe four "
7720.76,"or five other things that you've said, at least, "
7723.58,that are going to inspire me to change my behaviors. 
7726.3,I'm going to start doing some high-intensity interval training. 
7728.08,"Dr. Andy Galpin was on this podcast recently, "
7730.85,and he told me that the subtle zone 
2,cardio 
7733.55,"and the weight training's great, "
7734.78,but that I really should be doing 
7735.94,"some max heart rate work per week, "
7739.04,going into max heart rate for 
90,"seconds, "
7740.77,"then resting and repeating that, maybe even mild repeats. "
7743.64,"I'm just curious, as a brief aside, "
7745.19,"before we talk about heat, "
7749.06,what sort of cardiovascular 
7751.04,or other types of training do you do? 
7753.04,Do you do HIT? 
7753.873,I imagine you are doing high-intensity interval training. 
7756.03,If you could just give us a sense of the contour 
7758.13,of your week as it relates to exercise. 
7761.64,Because you've been very gracious 
7762.63,"in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food, "
7765.0,what about exercise? 
7766.99,"- So it all depends on my week, of course, "
7769.506,and what I've got going on with my son and my work schedule. 
7772.78,But I do a lot of high-intensity interval Tabatas 
7777.43,on a stationary cycle. 
7778.66,I use Peloton because I just like that instructor there 
7783.175,"telling me what to do, "
7784.008,and then me competing with everyone else. 
7785.49,"I'm like, ah, you know? "
7786.872,So it works for me. - You're revealing something 
7788.22,about your psychology. 
7789.053,This is good. We just learned about. 
7790.27,So this podcast is actually just a decoy 
7792.69,for psychological assessment of the guest. 
7795.226,"No, I'm kidding. "
7796.25,"So, now, we know you're competitive. "
7797.52,Good. - [Rhonda] Yeah. 
7798.6,- That explains a lot of how you got through graduate school 
7801.76,and then do what you do. 
7803.3,"So you're getting on the Peloton, and what does it look like "
7805.53,for someone who's not familiar with Peloton? 
7807.27,"I know what they are, but I've never been on one. "
7810.24,You're pedaling against the instructor for how many seconds? 
7813.61,"- So there's a bunch of people that are online, "
7816.29,either doing the class with you 
7817.48,"at the same time or all time doing it, "
7820.15,"so you can kind of toggle on what you want, "
7823.127,and you can try to compete 
7824.37,against the all time number. - So it's really competitive. 
7825.97,"- [Rhonda] Oh, yeah. - Okay. "
7826.98,"- And the instructor is just there to, like, whip you. "
7830.59,"You know, make you. "
7833.59,The brilliance with Peloton is... 
7836.45,I used to do what's called rush cycle. 
7839.77,It's basically you go in and group cycle 
7841.96,"and have an instructor there, "
7842.793,and you do all this high-intensity interval training stuff. 
7844.607,And I loved it because there was a competitive aspect to it 
7849.103,that had me working harder than I would work 
7852.235,"if it was just me in the room, "
7853.34,"like without an instructor or anyone there, "
7856.17,"and it was just like, I'm at a gym, any gym, "
7859.29,and I'm just on a stationary cycle 
7860.68,"listening to a podcast, doing something, "
7862.01,"which is fine if that's your groove, right? "
7863.86,But there is something about that group setting 
7867.56,"that kind of holds you accountable too, right? "
7870.977,And the Peloton made it somehow virtual. It was amazing. 
7874.69,"And I remember being back at rush cycle, "
7876.4,"this is before pandemic, "
7877.62,"and people talking about Peloton in my class, "
7879.56,"and I'm like, ""Oh, that's ridiculous. Why would I do that? "
7881.377,"""That's never going to work. I need to be here."" "
7883.9,"And then, the pandemic hit and I was all over the Peloton, "
7887.14,and it works for me really well. 
7889.36,So I tend to do that at least three times a week. 
7893.41,"Sometimes I do it more, like I'll do four. "
7895.97,And I do a 
10,"minute, just "
"10,",
7898.74,"because it's efficient, and I push my ass. "
7901.12,I push myself really hard. 
7902.58,- That's the Tabata. 
7903.413,- It's 
20,"seconds on, "
10,"seconds off, and it's "
10,minutes. 
7906.79,- And on means you're pedaling 
7908.04,like your life depended on it. - [Rhonda] You're maxing it. 
7909.8,- And there's a lot of resistance in the pedals? 
7913.91,- I always do resistance. 
7915.07,I like the power. I do the power. 
7917.0,"There's a part where you're sitting cycling, "
7918.97,"and you're trying to go really fast, "
7920.06,but I always crank the resistance up. 
7921.61,I always go above what they give me. 
7923.514,"And then, there's a part where you're standing, "
7925.42,"and then you really crank the resistance up, "
7927.54,"which I really do, and you feel it in your glutes. "
7929.44,"- It's like going up a hill. - Yeah, exactly. "
7931.18,"And so they break it up, "
7932.17,and most of the time you'll have those two parts. 
7935.17,And I love the efficiency of it. 
7937.41,You get it done. 
7938.813,"And people sometimes hear me, go, """
10,minutes? 
7940.733,"""Oh, really? You think you work?"" "
7941.847,"I'm like, look, you do max Tabata for "
10,"minutes, "
7946.16,and it's intense. 
7948.17,"- Yeah, most people can't sprint for the gate "
7951.47,"of an airplane they're about to miss, carrying a backpack. "
7955.01,"So, if I think about that, "
7957.09,"and I've just described myself, "
7959.12,"sprinting through the airport and going, "
7960.617,"""All right, Andy Galpin, "
7961.547,"""I got my "
90,"seconds max heart rate in for you, "
7963.857,"""carrying this thing."" "
7965.55,But 
20,"seconds on, "
10,"seconds off, "
7968.2,repeating that over and over for 
10,"minutes, "
7970.19,"so, by the time you're done, you're cooked. "
7971.98,"- And then, because I'm competitive "
7974.01,"during the recovery that they give you at the end, "
7976.27,"I'm pushing it max, so I get the numbers higher. "
7978.83,- Great. 
7979.663,So three times a week. - [Rhonda] It's a trick. 
7980.81,"- Yeah, three times a week, "
7981.643,"and then I always have my sauna on preheating up, "
7984.97,"takes about an hour and a half, "
7986.08,and I get it to about 
189,degrees Fahrenheit. 
7989.13,I hop right in the sauna after my Peloton. 
7992.67,- So the elevated heart rate continues. 
7994.19,Is that the rationale? 
7995.03,"- Yeah, I literally down a bunch of water, "
7997.86,"and then I get in, "
7998.7,"and then I either read a science paper, "
8003.02,"prepare for a presentation or a podcast, "
8005.47,or I hash over things in my mind. 
8008.7,And it's interesting because something about 
8012.63,"getting in the sauna, "
8014.68,"I think the stress, the heat stress of it. "
8018.01,So I started doing the sauna in 
2009,in graduate school. 
8020.97,- You're an early adopter. 
8022.37,- I started doing it every day. I lived across the street. 
8025.218,I lived in a studio apartment with Dan. 
8027.39,"We lived in this small studio apartment, "
8028.95,"smallest apartment you could ever imagine, "
8030.52,"and it was across the street from a YMCA, "
8032.19,"'cause I was poor in graduate school, "
8034.22,"very poor, very poor. "
8036.928,- I recall. I lived in my lab. 
8040.98,"- Wow, really? "
8041.813,"- But, then again, I lived in my lab as a postdoc. "
8044.7,"I admit, I lived in my lab with my bulldog "
8046.71,as a faculty member for other reasons. 
8050.21,But I get it. 
8051.26,"When you're a graduate student, you're poor, basically. "
8052.99,"- Yes, and so I used to go to the sauna "
8056.92,"before going into the lab, "
8059.5,"and I started noticing that I was, all of a sudden, "
8064.19,"able to handle stress better, "
8066.35,like the stress of my six-month setback 
8070.25,"because of a failed experiment, which is crushing, "
8073.4,on top of the pressure from my advisor and my own pressure 
8078.96,"'cause I'm very competitive with myself, "
8080.53,and I put a lot of pressure on myself. 
8081.653,So I was having a hard time. 
8084.04,I was very stressed out in graduate school. 
8085.42,And this sauna started to really noticeably affect 
8089.11,my anxiety and my ability to handle stress. 
8092.42,"And I was like, what is going on here? "
8095.0,So I started looking into the literature 
8097.97,and started getting interested in the effects on the brain. 
8101.12,"And, in fact, at the time, I had a friend "
8103.36,who was not actually experimentally 
8105.71,but theoretically looking into the opioid system. 
8112.02,"So, when you get in the sauna, "
8114.56,you release a lot of endorphins. 
8115.96,Endorphins are the feel-good opioids 
8119.48,"that make you feel good, "
8121.12,but you also release something called dynorphin. 
8124.26,And dynorphin is an endogenous opioid 
8126.89,that binds to a receptor called the kappa opioid receptor. 
8131.29,Dynorphin is responsible for that dysphoric feeling 
8134.75,"when you're in the sauna and you're hot, "
8135.987,"and when you're running, doing exercise, "
8137.97,and you feel uncomfortable. 
8141.77,"Well, I think that's dynorphin. "
8143.35,"I'm speaking absolute, "
8144.183,"but I think it is. - No, I think it is. "
8145.016,"I mean, there's evidence in alcoholics "
8148.26,that some of the symptoms of withdrawal that they experience 
8151.15,are related to dynorphin. 
8152.453,And dynorphin is known to negatively impact 
8156.33,the dopamine receptor system. 
8158.57,"So, basically, it's the feel-like-garbage pathway. "
8161.11,"- Right, you feel like garbage, "
8162.14,"and so you think that that would not be good, "
8165.75,but this is where my friend comes in. 
8168.49,He was looking at the effects 
8169.95,of treating morphine or heroin addiction. 
8173.6,"And people that are using those drugs, "
8176.1,"they, basically, the endorphins or the morphine or heroin, "
8182.72,they bind to a receptor in the brain 
8184.29,called the mu opioid receptor. 
8186.1,"And, as they take these drugs, "
8188.7,"that mu opioid receptor becomes downregulated, "
8191.64,and so you need more and more of the drug 
8194.48,to feel as good as you did. 
8195.84,"Well, endorphins also bind to that receptor. "
8198.41,And he was looking into some of the other drugs 
8202.0,"that are like salvinoria, salvinorin, or something. "
8205.59,Salvia it's called. It binds to the kappa opioid receptor. 
8209.31,It also makes you kind of feel uncomfortable. 
8210.8,"Anyways, he had put some studies in front of me "
8214.62,that showed basically binding of either dynorphin 
8219.62,or whatever ligand to the kappa opioid receptor 
8222.96,basically sensitizes the mu opioid receptor 
8226.04,"to the feel-good endorphins and also changes, "
8228.78,"I think it also upregulates it or something, "
8231.64,"so, basically, there's a lasting effect of feeling good. "
8234.01,So the endorphins that you release later 
8235.66,"from hugging someone, "
8237.39,"or a joke you're laughing at, or whatever, "
8239.98,"you feel it for longer, right? "
8241.94,"And so, anyways, with respect to the sauna, "
8245.9,it's a big sort of hypothesis of mine. 
8247.42,I did kind of publish that part of my hypothesis 
8250.65,"in a review article, but I do wish more people "
8253.61,would kind of look into that. 
8254.64,That'd be amazing. 
8256.85,"But what I was getting at, I think, was, "
8260.35,I would use the sauna to memorize things. 
8264.58,"This is way back in the day, and I still do it. "
8266.65,And I wanted to talk to you about this 
8268.358,"because you're a neuroscientist, "
8270.83,that there's something about being in the sauna. 
8274.67,And I don't know if it has to do with the stress response. 
8278.33,"Like, when you have an emotional trigger, "
8281.03,"you remember things better, right? "
8282.63,- Absolutely. 
8283.61,There is a clear and known explanation mechanism for this. 
8288.14,"- So, in the sauna, you also release norepinephrine, "
8292.24,just like you do in the cold. There's a lot of overlap. 
8295.71,"It is a stressor, but I use it to remember things. "
8300.46,"Like, I'm going through something. "
8301.6,"I want to go through a presentation, or a talk, "
8303.41,"or a podcast, or whatever. "
8304.86,And I go in that sauna. 
8305.98,"And you should try it, if you haven't already. "
8308.35,I don't know if you have. 
8309.183,"- I have a sauna and Cold Plunge now, "
8310.327,and I haven't tried preparing. 
8312.19,I read books in the sauna in the evening. 
8315.33,"It's a time I insist on having my phone out of there, "
8319.38,"initially because I thought I'd cook the phone, "
8321.41,but also just to get some separation 
8322.87,"from the phone and screens in the evening, so I read books. "
8325.15,"The only challenge, "
8325.983,"sometimes you're dripping sweat onto the books, "
8327.23,but I'm willing to forego a few pages of a book. 
8332.165,The idea that being in this semi-stressful environment 
8335.62,would aid in the learning and retention of information 
8339.07,is really well substantiated. 
8340.61,There's this beautiful work by a guy named James McGaw. 
8342.98,"I don't know if his lab's still active, "
8344.25,"but he was at UC Irvine for a while, "
8346.77,and then I think at University of Arizona as well. 
8350.41,"They have a great memory group at both places, "
8352.51,"very strong in learning and memory, both places. "
8355.35,And he was the one that really defined 
8357.21,"this kind of inverted, u-shaped function "
8360.83,for the relationship between adrenaline and memory. 
8364.19,"Basically, if you're too relaxed and not stressed enough, "
8367.9,you're not going to remember any information. 
8369.9,"At peak levels of stress, you actually are a memory machine, "
8374.74,at least within the context 
8375.77,of whatever it is you're trying to learn. 
8377.26,So what you're describing very well matches with that. 
8380.97,"Then, of course, it tapers off "
8382.48,as you really increase adrenaline to the point 
8385.04,"where people are starting to lose autonomic function, "
8387.48,"where they're panicking basically, "
8389.86,"but obviously, you're keeping it in range. "
8391.25,"The other thing that I would like to ask you about is, "
8393.36,"in the sauna, of course, there's vasodilation, "
8395.46,and perfusion of blood to the brain is a wonderful way 
8397.67,to enhance cognition. 
8398.89,"There's even some really nice data showing that, "
8400.97,"during inhales as opposed to exhales, "
8403.7,people are better at learning information. 
8406.83,"Believe it or not, during the inhale, "
8408.39,you're taking in and absorbing 
8409.8,and remembering more than during exhales. 
8411.51,"And these are beautiful studies done in humans, of course. "
8415.11,"So I can imagine that vasodilation, "
8417.78,"getting more perfusion of blood to the brain, "
8419.62,"plus a little bit of stress, "
8421.16,"or maybe a lot of stress from the epinephrine, "
8424.53,"and then, of course, there's going to be the, "
8426.74,"I don't want to call it placebo, "
8427.84,"but there's going to be the context, "
8429.72,"the condition, place context of it. "
8432.01,"Like, if we had a good experience "
8434.26,"remembering something in the sauna once, "
8436.35,the positive association effect of that location is real. 
8438.84,"Just like, if people go to a new city and they get robbed, "
8442.23,"like, if you go to Cincinnati, "
8443.4,"I've never been to Cincinnati, "
8444.24,"but you get robbed in Cincinnati, "
8445.43,"your purse gets taken or your wallet gets taken, "
8447.28,you kind of hate Cincinnati as a tourist. 
8449.47,But that could happen in any number 
8450.9,"of different cities, right? "
8452.01,"The opposite is also true, "
8453.43,so if something good happens someplace. 
8455.13,"So I'm imagining that it's a combination of those effects, "
8457.31,but it would be very hard to do this in the cold. 
8460.84,I feel like the cold is a very potent. 
8462.823,"I think it takes you too far down that curve, "
8464.95,the McGaw curve. 
8465.83,- I have to sing songs or something when I'm in there. 
8467.812,"- [Andrew] Distract yourself. - Oh yeah, I sing songs. "
8469.15,"- But afterward, you're very efficient at learning. "
8470.88,- After I am. 
8472.29,"With respect to the sauna, the vasodilation does occur, "
8475.4,so there's a lot of overlap 
8476.77,between moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and heat stress. 
8480.67,"As you can imagine, when you're exercising, "
8482.37,you're elevating your core body temperature. 
8485.16,You're sweating. 
8486.81,"When you're actually in the sauna, "
8488.45,blood does get redistributed to the skin 
8491.32,"to facilitate sweating, "
8492.53,"but, much like exercise, blood flow in general is improved "
8497.17,"to the brain, to the muscles, everywhere. "
8499.53,"So, I think, generally speaking, "
8502.914,and there's studies showing that sauna use is associated 
8506.32,with a much lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. 
8509.66,People that use it four to seven times a week 
8512.16,have greater than 
60%,reduction in dementia 
8515.62,and Alzheimer's disease risk 
8516.917,"compared to once- - Amazing, how many? "
8517.925,"Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. "
8518.98,"You said people who use it, "
8520.58,"I apologize, but maybe you could tell us again, "
8522.94,people use it four to seven times per week have... 
8525.853,- They have a greater than 
60%,reduction 
8528.9,in dementia risk and Alzheimer's disease risk 
8531.34,compared to people that use it only one time a week. 
8534.25,People that use it two to three times a week 
8536.26,have something like a 
"20,",
8538.29,a little greater than 
20%,reduction in risk. 
8539.523,There's a dose-dependent effect on dementia risk 
8543.33,and Alzheimer's disease risk. 
8545.41,It also has a profound. 
8547.941,There's a big link 
8549.19,between the cardiovascular system and the brain. 
8551.79,"Obviously, blood flow, a big one, right? "
8554.06,You need to get blood to your brain. 
8556.86,"But cardiovascular mortality, "
8559.67,so mortality from cardiovascular disease. 
8561.98,"If people use, or actually this was men. "
8563.74,"If men use the sauna four to seven times a week, "
8566.37,it's a 
50%,reduction in cardiovascular related mortality 
8570.1,compared to one time a week. 
8571.76,"Again, dose-dependent manner, two to three times a week "
8574.22,is something like 
24%,lower death 
8577.61,from cardiovascular disease. 
8578.9,"There's also lower sudden cardiac deaths, "
8582.15,like a heart attack. 
8583.13,That's like 
60,"something, greater than "
60%,"lower, "
8586.47,if men use it four to seven times a week versus once. 
8589.41,"Again, a dose-dependent thing. "
8591.54,The thing that's so profound there also to me 
8593.52,"when, again, looking at the methods, "
8595.1,"when I look at the data, "
8596.21,and this is all work from Dr. Jari Laukkanen. 
8599.4,He's in the University of Eastern Finland 
8602.759,"and just one of the world experts on sauna use, "
8605.89,especially with respect to cardiovascular health. 
8608.03,"What some of his data has also shown is that, "
8611.6,"if you look at the duration, the time spent in the sauna, "
8614.16,"so I mentioned the temperature I do is about, "
8616.95,I do 
189,degrees Fahrenheit. 
8619.39,"Typically, I go in there. "
8621.08,I'm pretty heat adapted. 
8623.496,"So the more you do the sauna or any sort of heat stress, "
8627.64,"whether it's a hot tub or jacuzzi, you become adapted. "
8631.307,You basically start to sweat 
8632.67,at a lower core body temperature to cool yourself down. 
8635.13,All these sort of physiological changes 
8636.53,start to happen earlier. 
8638.55,"And so, I stayed in for like "
30,"minutes, "
8640.964,so I stayed in a long time. 
8642.98,That's a lot. You have to listen to your body. 
8644.81,"Most of the studies that I just talked about, "
8648.88,"the duration, the time spent in the sauna, "
8651.31,when I said 
50%,reduction 
8652.97,"in cardiovascular disease related death, "
8655.59,what was shown was that men that were in the sauna 
8657.99,for only 
11,"minutes, "
8659.76,"even if they used it four to seven times a week, "
8661.57,that reduction was only like 
8%,instead of 
50.,
8664.72,It had to be greater than 
19,"minutes, "
8667.733,so like 
20,"minutes is the sweet spot, "
8669.81,at about 
174,degrees Fahrenheit. 
8674.55,"And most of the saunas in Finland, by the way, "
8676.692,"they're humid, so they put hot water, "
8681.12,"they put water on hot rocks to create steam, "
8684.03,so it's usually between 
10,to 
20%,humidity 
8686.66,in the Finnish sauna. 
8688.06,"So those studies were, I would say, most of the time, "
8690.8,you're going to find that their humidity is also elevated. 
8693.57,"But, to me, the dose-dependent nature of it "
8696.92,"and the duration, "
8699.22,"to me, that's very strong data that this is more causal "
8703.94,than some corollary thing. 
8705.69,Because that's always the problem 
8707.29,"with observational studies, including these, "
8709.88,"which they corrected for a whole host of factors, "
8712.3,"like cholesterol, exercise, just everything, "
8715.27,"everything under the sun, they corrected for those. "
8717.31,"And, on top of that, "
8718.72,"you have the dose-dependent nature of the duration, "
8720.437,"the time spent in the sauna, and the frequency. "
8723.49,"So, to me, it's like, something's going on here. "
8726.17,"- Yeah. - Plus there's been studies, "
8727.33,"intervention studies, "
8728.163,"where it's comparing directly, head-to-head "
8731.03,moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on a stationary cycle 
8734.49,to 
20,minutes in a sauna. 
8737.82,"Physiologically the same things happen, "
8739.5,"so heart rate elevates while you're doing the activity, "
8744.34,"blood pressure increases while you're doing the activity, "
8746.42,"but then, after, heart rate decreases, "
8749.29,"resting heart rate decreases below baseline, "
8751.64,"blood pressure is improved, so it decreases below baseline. "
8754.41,This is happening the same 
8755.59,in moderate-intensity cycling versus sauna. 
8758.22,"So, again, the sauna, this heat stress, "
8761.03,there's something about it that really mimics 
8763.78,"this moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, "
8766.39,"which is really great for people that can't go for a run, "
8770.24,"that can't even get on a bike, so disabled people. "
8773.74,"Granted, there are some safety concerns. "
8775.64,"They're pretty mild, but they do exist. "
8778.78,So people that had a recent heart attack 
8780.28,or have some rare kind of heart disease or problem. 
8783.28,"Drinking alcohol, never do that. "
8784.45,Elderly people prone to low blood pressure. 
8787.33,Always talk to a physician before doing the sauna. 
8789.44,It is stressful. 
8790.95,"- Pregnant. - Pregnant women, yeah. "
8792.61,I definitely avoided saunas when I was pregnant. 
8797.88,I think it's very relevant for disabled people 
8799.51,and also people that are sedentary 
8801.16,or been sedentary most of their life. 
8802.3,"Like, my mother, I've been able to get her in the sauna "
8805.87,because she's not. 
8807.21,"I did get her on the Peloton once, "
8809.4,but it's really much easier. 
8810.76,"She feels like it's a spa treatment, "
8813.07,and she can listen to her music in there. 
8816.45,"Like, I care about her health, "
8817.81,but she's mostly been a sedentary person. 
8820.27,And so I find it much easier to convince her 
8823.89,to get in the sauna than to get on Peloton. 
8826.34,"Ideally, you do both. "
8827.24,"The question would be, well, I exercise, I run, "
8830.03,I do my high-intensity interval training. 
8832.14,Why do I need to get in the sauna? 
8833.85,"And the reality is, "
8836.265,and so I published all this in a review 
8838.38,in the Experimental Dermatology 
8840.86,"last year, I guess, late last year. "
8844.57,"Basically, cardiorespiratory fitness, "
8847.37,"which is a marker of, "
8849.35,it's a marker of health. 
8851.95,Cardiorespiratory fitness is improved 
8854.44,in people that do exercise and sauna 
8857.37,compared to exercise alone or sauna alone. 
8860.02,"So, for those healthy, fit people out there "
8862.96,"already exercising, "
8864.55,there's a synergistic effect 
8867.32,by also adding a sauna into that routine. 
8869.83,"And, to me, that's great. "
8871.66,And there's so many beneficial things 
8874.63,happening with the heat stress. 
8876.75,"In addition to mimicking aerobic exercise, "
8879.07,there's the heat shock proteins 
8880.21,that we talked about earlier. 
8881.63,"And those, it kind of brings me back "
8883.4,to my early days of science 
8885.59,when I at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies 
8888.65,doing research on little nematode worms that we 
8894.06,or someone else injected amyloid beta 
"42,",
8897.8,"the peptide, the "
42-amino,acid peptide that is involved 
8902.15,in amyloid plaques found in the brain 
8904.83,correlating with Alzheimer's disease 
8906.22,and other brain disorders. 
8908.16,We injected those into the muscle tissue of worms. 
8911.49,"And, basically, these worms become paralyzed with age "
8914.7,"because the aggregated proteins, "
8918.37,these proteins aggregate. 
8920.2,"Well, heat shock proteins, "
8921.36,one of the main things they do is they basically make sure 
8924.48,the proteins inside of your cells 
8926.45,maintain their proper three-dimensional structure 
8928.98,"and are folded right, and so they don't, "
8931.96,they're not prone to aggregating and forming these plaques 
8935.89,in your arteries and also in the brain. 
8939.3,"Back to my worm studies I was doing, "
8942.39,"I would elevate heat shock proteins in these worms, "
8944.517,"and it would totally correct the problem, "
8947.41,where they would no longer become paralyzed. 
8949.77,They'd move around like they were young. 
8951.12,"So, many animal studies have been done "
8953.38,"looking at Alzheimer's disease, "
8957.817,"a human-like Alzheimer's disease in a rodent, "
8960.27,and heat shock proteins protecting from it. 
8963.31,Heat shock proteins are robustly activated in humans. 
8966.44,"This has been shown to, "
8969.28,even 
50%,higher over baseline levels after just 
30,minutes 
8973.65,at 
163,degrees Fahrenheit in the sauna. 
8977.64,"And they stay activated, at least, in rodents, "
8979.74,for 
48,"hours, at least. "
8983.283,"So having these heat shock proteins around, "
8986.96,making sure they're properly taking care of our proteins 
8990.05,"so they're not aggregating in our brains and in our plaques, "
8992.83,could be another potential way that sauna's protecting 
8995.83,from Alzheimer's disease and other cardiovascular health 
9000.38,as well as longevity. 
9003.53,There's people that have SNPs 
9005.23,in heat shock protein factor 
70,
9008.15,"that, if they have one of them, "
9010.3,so they got one from their parents 
9011.45,where they have more active heat shock protein 
"70,",
9013.64,they live on average one year longer 
9015.35,than people that don't have that SNP. 
9016.87,"And if they have two versions, "
9018.2,"if they got one from their mom and one from their dad, "
9020.38,they live on average two years longer 
9021.893,than people that don't have that SNP. 
9023.085,- [Andrew] Wow. - So it's also been associated 
9024.62,with human longevity as well as in lower organisms. 
9026.77,So you can heat shock a worm or a fly 
9028.78,and they live 
15%,longer. 
9030.85,This is work done by Gordon Lithgow at the Buck Institute 
9033.207,years and years ago. 
9036.245,"So, anyways, "
9037.76,I guess what I was getting at was the heat shock proteins 
9040.94,are part of that stress response pathway 
9042.47,that we talked about earlier. 
9045.06,They're also activated by cold as well. 
9046.84,Cold shock does activate heat shock proteins. 
9049.05,Not as robust. Sulforaphane activates them. 
9051.51,"Again, it's one of the reasons "
9052.343,I think we should get all of these things 
9054.26,because they are more robust inputs. 
9057.5,The input activating mechanisms are more robust 
9060.53,for different ones. 
9062.04,So there is crosstalk. 
9064.81,I guess it'd be more accurate to say there's overlap. 
9068.81,"But it's also like, "
9071.82,"you want to get the most robust from all of them, right? "
9074.01,"I do, so that's why I want to do the sauna and exercise "
9078.07,and eat my broccoli sprouts and all that stuff. 
9083.43,- It's super interesting. 
9085.56,A couple of questions came up for me. 
9088.23,"One is, you mentioned these SNPs, "
9091.32,"these nucleotide repeats, "
9093.19,basically genes that some people have more of 
9095.16,or less of than others 
9097.02,that can predict longevity in some sense. 
9100.13,Is that the FOXO
3,pathway? 
9102.6,- That's one that can. 
9103.9,"Yeah, I mean, FOXO"
3,"is, in fact, "
9106.87,"if you go back to the worm studies I was talking about, "
9108.89,that was one of the first things 
9110.5,when you see it with your own eyes. 
9111.87,"You can take these worms that, "
9114.4,you basically decrease their insulin signaling pathway 
9117.73,and their IGF-
1.,
9119.08,"Worms have what are called homologous genes, "
9121.54,so they have a lot of similarities to humans. 
9124.22,"They have an insulin-like receptor, "
9125.467,they have an IGF-
1-like,"receptor, "
9127.81,and they make something like FOXO
"3,",which we have. 
9130.49,"And, basically, if you decrease "
9133.36,"that insulin signaling pathway, "
9134.62,then FOXO
3,"is always active in those worms, "
9137.4,and they live like 
100%,longer. 
9139.32,"And not only do they live longer, "
9141.85,they are like a very young worm. 
9145.11,"I mean, you look at this thing and you're like, "
9147.547,"""This looks like the worm that was just born like hours ago. "
9150.867,"""What's going on? This thing's at the end of its life."" "
9153.52,"Now, as a side note, "
9155.077,"the thing that always got me on this was, "
9157.77,"by the way, this was discovered by Cynthia Kenyon. "
9160.64,This was back in the '
90s.,
9163.18,"Honestly, I'm not sure that anything "
9164.297,"has been as exciting in the worm world since then, "
9166.55,but I thought it was a really big finding. 
9170.231,The only caveat there 
9171.91,is that the worms go through this dauer. 
9173.94,"It's called a dauer stage when this happens, "
9176.72,"when you decrease their insulin signaling and stuff, "
9178.92,and they go into this like metabolic stasis. 
9181.43,They're not eating as much or moving. 
9183.14,"And so it's like, okay, well they live "
100%,"longer, "
9185.52,"but they go into this weird state, you know? "
9188.56,"- I know people like this, "
9189.49,some in the longevity community. 
9191.45,They know who they are. 
9193.26,"But they'll get the last laugh 'cause I'll be dead, "
9195.58,"well fed but dead, and they'll still be going. "
9199.86,"So, in terms of the many data on sauna, "
9203.64,and I also just want to acknowledge these Finnish groups 
9207.43,that did this work. 
9208.263,"It's really pioneering, right? "
9209.31,When you think 
20,"years ago, "
9210.57,"long before social media or any of this, "
9212.76,"and they're out there, "
9214.07,"up there, I should say, "
9216.11,measuring cortisol and growth hormone and all this stuff 
9219.85,in people getting in and out of sauna. 
9221.91,"Very, very interesting. "
9224.02,So 
20,minutes seems like the threshold 
9227.03,at 
170,degrees Fahrenheit. 
9231.22,More times per week seems to be better than fewer 
9234.28,"in terms of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular risk "
9236.99,according to what I just learned from you. 
9238.57,"- Four would be a good, I think, minimum effective dose. "
9241.43,"- Four times a week, and you combine it with the cold. "
9244.1,"I've also seen a protocol, where, "
9246.423,"it's a very extreme protocol, "
9248.13,"I don't recommend this to people right off the bat, "
9249.91,where they had human subjects 
9251.95,get into the sauna for 
30,"minutes, get out for five, "
9254.39,
30,"minutes, get out for five, "
30,"minutes, "
9256.18,"for a total of two hours of exposure, "
9258.55,but that was what led to these massive 
16-fold,increases 
9262.75,in growth hormone. 
9265.79,And they had to do it very seldom. 
9267.22,"So it sounds like these protocols you're describing, "
9268.9,
20,"minutes done four times per week, "
9271.077,are far more reasonable for most people to access. 
9273.86,"But I know people are probably desperate to know, "
9277.33,what if they don't have a sauna? 
9279.07,"A sauna is kind of a unique item, "
9280.72,so I have a couple questions. 
9282.03,Can people use hot baths? 
9284.47,"With the appropriate warning, of course. "
9286.9,Without getting into description 
9288.19,"of the mechanics and the underlying biology, "
9290.24,"it's pretty obvious that the testes, "
9294.4,"if they get too warm, you'll kill sperm. "
9297.53,That's the reason why the testes are housed 
9299.61,"in a structure called the scrotum that can move around, "
9302.24,"so just to be, you know, "
9303.49,"we are biologists, just talking about realities here. "
9306.83,"So, if you're trying to conceive children "
9308.95,"or keep your sperm healthy, "
9310.87,"guys should probably stay out of warm, hot baths. "
9313.33,- For at least six months. 
9314.21,That's been shown. - [Andrew] Six months. 
9316.739,- So sperm motility goes down 
9318.44,"and sperm production goes down, "
9320.65,but that is completely corrected 
9323.45,if they stay out of the sauna for six months. 
9325.24,"So through six months later, it's back to normal. "
9327.67,"- Great, that's a very useful information, I'm sure, "
9329.97,to a number of people out there. 
9332.29,"So, if people don't have access to a sauna, "
9336.987,and we get this about cold too. 
9337.957,"People always say, ""What about cold showers?"" "
9340.04,"And I always say, well, "
9340.873,the studies have mainly been done on immersion 
9342.85,'cause it's hard to keep things controlled in cold showers. 
9345.59,It just doesn't make for a very good experiment 
9347.01,"'cause you get a bigger person, "
9349.15,"less of them is under the shower, "
9350.52,and so it doesn't make for a good experiment. 
9351.94,"So it's not as good as immersion, "
9353.65,"but, with heat, I could imagine that a hot bath "
9356.19,would work almost as well. 
9358.0,"- Yeah, so there's been some studies looking at, "
9359.81,"for example, activation of heat shock proteins, "
9361.7,also brain-derived neurotrophic factor increases 
9363.89,with heat stress. 
9364.99,And so the hot bath at around 
104,"degrees Fahrenheit, "
9369.55,"which is typically what studies will use for temperature, "
9372.32,which is actually cooler than what I. 
9374.14,I crank my bath hot. It's so hot. 
9375.69,- But you're very heat adapted. 
9377.74,"- I'm very heat adapted, yeah. "
9379.09,And it's 
20,"minutes from the shoulders down, "
9381.57,and that is a very robust activation in heat shock proteins 
9385.18,and in brain-derived neurotrophic factor. 
9388.04,"And then, heat shock proteins are also protecting "
9390.44,"against muscle atrophy, "
9391.53,so that's also having to do with the protein structure 
9393.57,and the muscle tissue as well. 
9394.72,And this has been studies in animal data 
9398.27,as well as some recent human data as well. 
9400.48,"It was local hyperthermia or local heat treatment, "
9403.15,but essentially it showed that it protected. 
9406.84,"There was a study where they were looking at muscle disuse, "
9410.04,and it was something like the local heat treatment 
9413.14,prevented almost 
40%,of the muscle atrophy from disuse. 
9417.72,And it's funny 'cause I used to use the sauna 
9419.39,when I was injured and stuff. 
9420.36,I would go in the sauna. 
9421.96,Because I didn't know at the time 
9424.29,"'cause I was a graduate student, "
9425.45,but I knew just from experiments 
9427.65,that I'm not losing as much muscle. 
9430.47,I feel better. 
9432.02,"At the time, I was reading all about the growth hormone "
9434.331,and stuff back then. 
9436.157,"And I knew about heat shock proteins, "
9438.3,"so I kind of knew, but that data wasn't around yet, "
9441.59,and so now we have the data. 
9443.67,"And I've always felt like I wasn't losing my muscle, "
9447.74,"like I should've been, when I was doing the sauna. "
9449.663,And I was doing it literally seven days a week. 
9452.6,It was hardcore. 
9453.61,- This is also during graduate school? 
9455.53,"- Yeah, now, I'm doing the sauna, "
9459.09,"like a bare minimum, I do three, but I try to do four. "
9462.89,It all depends on my schedule. 
9465.16,I also like to do long runs. 
9467.68,"Long being like three miles, "
9469.41,"not like campaigns, which are long. "
9472.3,"But I really, for me, "
9474.47,and we were talking about this earlier off camera 
9476.69,"that the runs, for me, are for my brain. "
9480.44,"And I'd get this mind-wandering effect, "
9483.84,where I daydream and I think about things. 
9485.37,I work through problems. 
9486.49,I get creative. I come up with ideas. 
9488.39,And this is all happening on the runs. 
9490.48,"And so I miss my runs if I don't do 'em, "
9495.07,and I miss it because of the brain effects I get from it. 
9498.98,"And when I exercise, it's funny, "
9501.57,"because I'm a female, and you'd think that I'd be exercising "
9504.46,"to stay fit and in shape and care about my figure, "
9507.38,"but, when I exercise, "
9508.82,literally what I'm thinking about is my brain. 
9511.75,"And I'm like, ""This is the best longevity drug there is. "
9514.46,"""This is it right here, Rhonda. "
9516.417,"""You're always wondering. You're always wanting to know. "
9518.11,"""You're wanting to do the best."" "
9518.98,"If you don't exercise, you're missing that essential dose. "
9522.45,"And so that, for me, is the motivation, "
9525.52,the dopamine seeking thing I'm looking for. 
9528.24,"Admittedly, I do not do enough strength training. "
9532.32,"And I have to do it. Have to, have to, have to. "
9535.82,"I'm so after the endurance and the HIT, "
9537.72,and I really need to add that in. 
9540.21,Because muscle mass is also extremely important 
9542.79,"for aging as well, you know? "
9544.15,So that's my fault. 
9546.52,"- Well, the brain effects are really interesting. "
9549.97,I also run. 
9551.19,"I try and get one longer run per week and a few other runs, "
9553.44,and I do it without a phone. 
9555.3,I don't listen to podcasts. 
9556.61,"I occasionally will listen to music, "
9558.19,but I really try not to. 
9559.69,I also find that my mind solves problems. 
9562.1,"I feel like it washes out the cobwebs, so to speak. "
9566.27,Some of the most brilliant 
9568.8,and prolific neuroscientists that I know 
9571.89,who've had very long careers. 
9573.45,"Eric Kandel, Nobel Prize winner at Columbia, "
9575.44,"comes to mind for all his work on memory, "
9577.35,"used to swim a mile a day, "
9579.3,"and now I think swims half a mile a day, "
9581.28,but he's in his late 
90s,"and he's still sharp, "
9584.56,which is incredible. 
9585.87,And his lab has done some work showing 
9587.49,"that any load-bearing exercise repeated, so endurance work, "
9591.4,"unlike the Peloton or cycling, that's really load-bearing, "
9593.7,"although you're cycling really hard with the resistance, "
9595.77,"but causes the release of osteocalcin from the bones, "
9601.05,"which acts in an endocrine way, sort of like a hormone, "
9604.32,can actually travel to the hippocampus 
9606.37,"and, at least in these animal studies, "
9608.55,"induce the proliferation of neurons, growth of synapses, "
9611.98,"BDNF, a number of downstream things, "
9613.65,"which kind of makes sense, "
9615.34,if we were to put a just so evolutionary story on this. 
9618.61,A body that's active can signal to the brain 
9621.46,that the body still needs cognition. 
9623.51,"An inactive body, in some ways, "
9625.65,is depriving the brain of any signal 
9628.37,"about what the body is doing, right? "
9630.558,"Obviously, I'm making this up as conjecture, "
9633.41,but we know in various ocean animals 
9637.05,"that they'll swim around for some period of their life, "
9639.01,and then they'll have a completely stationary 
9641.08,"portion of their life, "
9641.93,"and basically, the brain degenerates. "
9644.49,You don't need much of a nervous system 
9645.82,if you're not moving. 
9646.81,"So I think there's really something there, "
9648.09,and also just letting the ideas and mind drift. 
9651.28,"I love that you, "
9652.27,"and I appreciate that you shared your protocols, "
9654.35,"because I think, right now, we're in an interesting time "
9657.39,"in public health information history, "
9659.75,where people are just kind of getting bombarded 
9662.1,"with cold is good, heat is gold. "
9664.71,Cold is good. Heat is good. 
9666.57,"Excuse me, I misspoke. "
9668.55,"There are all these micronutrients, "
9670.05,"and, of course, macronutrients are important too. "
9673.0,"Today, you've really enriched us with the description "
9677.04,"of the underlying mechanisms and the logic behind them, "
9679.67,but also sharing what you do is really informative 
9682.25,"because I think people need a jumping-off place, "
9684.85,"and obviously they need to start someplace, "
9687.68,"and getting heat adapted, et cetera, takes time. "
9689.83,But I really appreciate 
9691.0,that you're willing to share your protocols 
9692.25,and that you do the things that you teach 
9694.76,and educate people about. 
9696.59,"As a final question, because I have to ask, "
9701.73,red light sauna or no red light sauna? 
9704.6,I've been a little bit vocal about my feelings 
9706.81,that none of the red light saunas I've ever been in 
9709.06,"got hot enough, and it was frustrating, "
9711.38,so I feel like it's neither here nor there. 
9713.77,"However, I do acknowledge that red light "
9716.0,and low-level light therapies 
9717.88,are now known to do a number of interesting things. 
9720.67,There was a Nobel Prize in 
1908,"for phototherapy for lupus, "
9723.86,so it's not like a new thing 
9725.65,the idea that light could do things 
9728.42,positive for our biology. 
9729.9,"But, do you have a red light in your sauna? "
9732.26,Do you think it's useful? 
9733.32,And I mention this because this is the number one question 
9736.74,"I get about sauna, "
9737.62,"red light or no red light, or some intermediate answer. "
9742.17,"- So I don't have an infrared sauna, "
9746.86,but I have a sauna that has lights. 
9749.21,"It makes red light, but I don't think it's the red light "
9750.95,that you're talking about. - Okay. 
9752.21,"- It's not activating it at a specific wavelength, "
9754.93,which is... 
9755.763,"- It's usually, so the range that seems to be helpful, "
9758.32,"and, I confess, I use a red light panel for other things, "
9762.94,is 
670,nanometer 
9765.51,out to about 
720,"nanometer, "
9769.11,"so it looks like red and very dim lights, "
9773.65,dim red and bright red. 
9775.37,"And the idea is that red light can travel, "
9777.39,the photon and energy is such that it can travel down 
9779.92,through the deep layers of the dermis of the skin. 
9783.442,- I don't have a red light in my sauna. 
9786.21,I don't know if it's essential or not. I don't think so. 
9790.8,"Based on all the studies I've talked about, I think, "
9793.87,the potential effect on mitochondria is interesting. 
9797.81,I do think there's a lack 
9800.04,"of really good, solid evidence in humans, "
9803.69,but that might only be because it's just not studied enough. 
9807.78,"And that's usually the case, so perhaps. "
9810.84,"There's the Joovv, right? The Joovv. "
9813.45,They have those red light panels and stuff. 
9814.49,"- Joovv and KOZE are the two ones I know, "
9816.76,K-O-Z-E and Joovv. 
9819.17,"As far as I know, "
9820.32,"I'm probably going to insult both companies at the same time, "
9822.36,but I'd rather insult them both at the same time 
9824.08,than just compliment one or insult one. 
9827.07,Both of them seem excellent 
9828.62,for getting the appropriate wavelengths of red light. 
9830.48,And I do not have a relationship 
9831.83,to either of those. - Yeah. 
9832.91,"Well, I personally think that the sauna in and of itself, "
9836.14,it's about the heat stress. 
9837.44,"And typically the question I get is, "
9839.85,infrared sauna or regular sauna? 
9842.27,And there are some differences as well. 
9844.4,Infrared saunas. 
9845.72,Maybe the infrared saunas are the ones 
9847.18,that have the red light that you're talking about. 
9849.12,Infrared saunas only get up to 
9850.59,around 
140,degrees Fahrenheit. 
9853.96,"So, as I mentioned, "
9854.93,the studies were about 
174,degrees Fahrenheit. 
9857.727,And so you really have to stay in a longer period of time. 
9862.77,"However, there have been some studies coming out of Japan. "
9866.05,They use infrared sauna. 
9869.44,They have this whole protocol. It's called Waon therapy. 
9872.75,"They get people in infrared saunas, "
9874.54,"and then they wrap 'em in a towel, "
9876.61,and they stay warm for X amount. 
9878.92,"So the whole protocol ends up being like an hour long, "
9882.05,"but, again, it's "
140,"degrees Fahrenheit, "
9884.26,"so it's an infrared sauna, "
9885.43,"and it's been shown to improve a variety of, "
9888.0,"like, coronary heart disease and conditions, "
9891.12,heart-related conditions. 
9892.26,There have been some improvements. 
9893.6,"So, obviously, there's evidence that infrared saunas "
9896.81,can be beneficial for cardiovascular health. 
9900.17,I've used infrared saunas many times at my in-laws. 
9903.07,They have an infrared sauna. 
9904.07,And I have to crank that thing up for a while 
9906.34,"until it's maxed, "
9907.66,and then I have to sit in there for an hour at least. 
9911.21,"I do sweat a lot, "
9912.06,and that's another thing we didn't talk about. 
9913.387,You do sweat some heavy metals. 
9915.53,And some heavy metals are excreted predominantly 
9919.9,through sweat and others through urine. 
9922.29,"So, for example, cadmium, "
9924.96,there's like a 
125-fold,increase 
9926.88,in cadmium excretion from sweat when you get in the sauna. 
9930.61,"Also, lead is something like "
17-fold,excretions higher. 
9934.71,Another one is aluminum. It's about fourfold higher. 
9937.18,"So infrared, you do sweat a lot too, "
9939.58,and that's because the main difference 
9941.26,is that you're heating your body up 
9943.68,through thermal radiation versus the ambient air. 
9948.22,"A standard sauna is a heater, "
9950.838,"and the heater's heating up the air, "
9952.3,and that's how you're heating yourself up. 
9954.49,So it is a little bit of a different mechanism. 
9956.44,I prefer regular saunas. 
9958.46,Most of the data out there is from the heat stress itself. 
9961.47,"Like, your heart rate's elevating when you're in there. "
9963.73,You're feeling hot. You're getting that cardiovascular. 
9965.49,That's what you're feeling when you're in a hot sauna. 
9968.153,"And that, for me, takes a really long time "
9970.38,"in the infrared sauna, like at the very end. "
9973.04,But I do think there are some benefits from infrared. 
9975.04,And they are more affordable. 
9976.52,They're less of a fire hazard. 
9978.14,"But, again, hot baths are, I think, "
9980.01,a good alternative modality for heat stress 
9983.44,compared to like a regular sauna. 
9985.62,"- Great, that's a really helpful answer. "
9987.77,"Like I said, I use the red light, but not in the sauna. "
9990.95,And thank you for reminding us 
9992.82,of that 
174,degree Fahrenheit threshold 
9995.76,that is mainly used in all these studies. 
9999.12,"We covered a lot of territory, "
10000.96,but I just want to thank you again. 
10002.83,It was extremely thorough and extremely informative. 
10006.72,My notes always look a little bit like they were drawn out 
10010.6,by a macaque monkey who has no knowledge 
10012.34,"of the English language, but I can decipher this "
10014.82,to tell you that there are at least 
10,additions 
10019.33,to my current protocols that I'm going to add. 
10021.55,"And I'll have lots of questions, "
10023.36,so I apologize in advance for that. 
10024.97,"But, on behalf of the listeners and just directly from me, "
10030.11,thank you so much for your time. 
10031.96,I learned a ton. 
10033.16,- My pleasure. Thanks for having me on. 
10034.706,"It was a really awesome conversation, so I enjoyed it a lot. "
10037.67,- Let's do it again. 
10038.93,- Totally.
