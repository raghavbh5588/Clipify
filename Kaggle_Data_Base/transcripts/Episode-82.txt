0.37 - [Andrew Huberman] Welcome to
the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.29 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
5.878 [bright upbeat music]
9.49 - I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.58 and I'm a Professor of
Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
13.07 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.26 Today, we continue our
discussion of the senses.
18.71 And the senses we are going to discuss
20.93 are pain and pleasure.
23.53 Pain and pleasure reflect two
opposite ends of a continuum,
27.41 a continuum that involves
detection of things in our skin
32.23 and the perception, the understanding
34.78 of what those events are.
37.31 Our skin is our largest sensory organ
40.49 and our largest organ indeed.
42.65 It is much larger than any of
the other organs in our body.
46.21 And it's an odd organ
if you think about it,
48.36 it has so many functions.
50.2 It acts as a barrier between our organs
52.197 and the outside world,
54.23 it harbors neurons nerve
cells that allow us
57.21 to detect things like
light touch, or temperature
61.44 or pressure of various kinds.
63.9 And it's an organ that
we hang ornaments on.
66.89 People put earrings in their ears.
69.23 People decorate their
skin with tattoos and inks
73.33 and other things.
74.76 And it's an organ that
allows us to experience
77.94 either great pain or great pleasure.
81.76 So it's a multifaceted organ and it's one
84.8 that our brain needs to make
sense of in a multifaceted way.
88.03 So today we're going to discuss all that.
89.596 And most importantly, how you
can experience more pleasure
94.55 and less pain by
understanding these pathways.
97.55 We will also discuss things you can do,
100.2 and if you wish things you can take
102.8 that will allow you to
experience more pleasure
105.74 and less pain in response
107.21 to a variety of different experiences.
110.01 Before I go any further,
111.33 I want to highlight a particularly
exciting area of science
114.81 that relates to the skin and to sensing
115.643 of pleasure and pain,
118.62 but has everything to do with motivation.
122.04 Motivation is something that
many people struggle with,
125.57 not everybody, but most
people experience dips
130.3 and peaks in their motivation
132.46 even if they really want something.
134.37 How should we think about
these changes in motivation?
136.93 What do they reflect?
138.55 Well at a very basic level,
they reflect fluctuations
142.36 changes in the levels of a
chemical called dopamine.
146.24 Most of us have heard of dopamine.
148.46 Dopamine is a neuromodulator
meaning it modulates
151.51 or changes the way that
neurons nerve cells work.
155.43 Most of us have heard that dopamine
157.59 is the molecule of pleasure.
159.84 However, that is incorrect.
161.9 Dopamine is a molecule of
motivation and anticipation.
167.54 To illustrate how dopamine works,
169.77 I want to highlight
some very important work
172.22 largely carried out by the laboratory
174.43 of a guy named Wolfram Schultz.
176.4 The Schultz Laboratory has done dozens
179.093 of excellent experiments
on the dopamine system
183.1 and have identified something called
184.77 reward prediction error.
187.38 Although in some sense
you can think about it
188.88 as reward prediction variance.
192.11 Changes in the levels
of dopamine depending
194.5 on whether or not you expect a reward
196.96 and whether or not you get the reward.
198.71 So I'm going to make this very simple.
201.98 Dopamine is released
into the brain and body
205.41 and generally makes us feel
activated and motivated,
209.22 as if we have energy to pursue a goal.
212.41 And it is released into the brain and body
214.83 in anticipation of a reward.
217.42 Measurements of dopamine have been made
219.08 in animals and humans.
220.48 And what you find is that
when we anticipate a reward,
224.92 dopamine is released,
226.68 we will put in the work
to achieve that reward.
229.33 That work could be mental
work or physical work,
231.77 but when the reward arrives,
234.49 dopamine levels drop
back down to baseline.
237.35 That's right.
238.183 When we receive a reward,
239.23 dopamine levels go back down to baseline.
242.5 So the way to envision this
as you can just imagine
245.19 a sort of increase in dopamine
as we anticipate something
248.04 we're working towards it,
we're working towards a goal.
250.69 We're excited about seeing
somebody or meeting somebody
253.48 or receiving some reward
and then the reward comes
256.58 and dopamine goes down.
258.57 Now that's all fine and good,
260.91 but there is a way to
get much more dopamine
263.45 out of that process and therefore a way
266.34 to have much more
motivation, energy, and focus
269.31 because those are the
consequences of elevated dopamine.
273.42 The way to do that is to
not deliver the reward
278.04 on an expected schedule.
280.12 So experiments have been done
where there's an anticipation
283.61 of a reward, there's work,
285.16 and then the reward
only arrives every other
287.97 or every third about of work, okay?
290.324 So this would be like
getting a pat on the head.
293.63 If you're a dog or a,
perhaps a child or an adult,
296.97 or getting a monetary reward
only for every third project
300.95 or every third race that you win.
303.55 Pick any kind of goal.
304.81 It doesn't matter.
305.643 These molecules don't care
about what you're pursuing.
307.63 They are a common currency of
different types of activities.
311.76 That's a regular reward schedule,
314.19 and it will not alter the
pattern of dopamine release
316.727 that I described before.
318.7 However, if the reward
arrives intermittently
323.46 almost randomly, so
you anticipate a reward
327.34 as a maybe it might come, it might come.
329.74 Then you work, work, work,
work, work, no reward.
332.94 You repeat the work, work,
work, work, work, work,
335.27 and then you get a reward.
336.31 So some trials, you do
some trials, you don't,
338.62 and it's completely random.
341.19 Under those conditions, the amplitude,
343.67 the amount of dopamine that's
released into your system
346.56 and the motivation to
continue working hard
349.89 or playing whatever kind
of game you're playing,
352.5 doubles or triples.
354.18 And this is the basis of
things like slot machines
356.33 and gambling.
357.163 And this is why so many
people will give so much
359.68 of their money up to casinos
and the casinos always win.
365.86 Sometimes people walk away with more money
367.67 than they came to the casino with,
369.4 but the vast majority of the time,
371.75 the house wins as they say.
373.57 And it's because they understand
375.13 intermittent reward schedules.
376.61 And you can apply this to stay motivated
379.08 in your own pursuits.
381.12 Rather than thinking about
the pleasure of a reward,
384.5 understand that dopamine
is released in response
388.13 to anticipation reward, and
that is the fuel for work.
393.36 And every once in awhile at
random remove the reward.
398.01 That's the way to continue
to stay motivated.
400.1 Not to reward every action or every goal.
403.5 And this is also true,
404.5 if you're trying to train up
children or train up players
408.7 on a team, you should
not celebrate every win.
412.28 I know that's a little counter-intuitive,
413.92 we're going to go more into
the biology of dopamine
417.73 and how it relates to the pleasure system
419.68 later on in the podcast,
421.15 but for now understand
intermittent reward schedules
425.08 harness the biology of dopamine
in ways that can allow you
428.84 essentially infinite motivation over time.
432.49 Before I go any further,
433.57 I want to acknowledge that
this podcast is separate
435.387 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
438.09 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
440.19 to bring zero cost to consumer information
442.57 about science and science-related tools
444.75 to the general public.
446.2 In keeping with that theme,
I'd like to thank the sponsors
448.74 of today's podcast.
450.4 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
453.311 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
455.86 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
458.49 to help you better understand your body
460.33 and help you reach your health goals.
462.6 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
466.27 for the simple reason that
many, if not all of the factors
469.92 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
472.34 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
475.23 And nowadays with the advent of DNA tests,
477.48 you can get further
knowledge into the mechanisms
479.48 that are going on in your body
481.04 and how those mechanisms are changing
482.9 as they relate to metabolism and hormones
485.23 and other aspects that
profoundly impact your wellbeing.
489.27 The problem with most
blood tests, however,
491.23 is that you get information
back and it will tell you
492.783 whether or not your levels
of something are higher, low,
495.68 or within range, but it doesn't
give you any directives.
498.9 It doesn't tell you what to
do with that information.
501.45 With InsideTracker has
this wonderful feature.
503.49 It's a very easy to use
dashboard that has suggestions
506.88 about lifestyle factors, exercise,
508.78 nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,
510.66 that one could take in order
to adjust those numbers
513.74 according to your personal goals.
515.55 So the whole thing is made very easy.
516.98 In fact, they can come to
your home to do the blood test
518.92 and DNA test if you like.
520.78 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
522.52 you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
525.94 And if you do that you'll get 25% off
528.1 any of InsideTracker's plans.
529.52 Just use the code huberman@checkout.
532.13 And I should also mention that
through August 15th, 2021,
536.17 you can get a free inner age test.
538.02 That's a measure of your biological age
540.08 according to your DNA and other factors
542.91 with any purchase from
InsideTracker store.
545.26 So go to insidetracker.com/huberman
to get 25% off
548.84 any of InsideTracker's plans and up to up
552.41 and through August 15th, you
can get a free inner age test.
556.32 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
559.31 Helix makes mattresses and pillows
561.15 that are ideally suited
to your sleep needs.
564.14 Everybody's different.
565.21 Some people sleep on their sides,
566.61 some people sleep on their stomach,
567.75 some people sleep on their back,
569.2 some people run warm during the night,
570.76 some people run cold.
573.21 If you go to the Helix's
website, helixsleep.com,
575.85 you can take a quick two-minute quiz,
578.03 and then it will tell you
what your ideal mattress is.
580.67 It will match you to your ideal mattress.
583.25 I did this and I matched to
the so-called Dusk mattress.
586.86 I like a mattress that's
not too firm nor too soft.
590.04 I tend to run hot during the night
591.75 and I tend to sleep on
my side or on my stomach.
594.94 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
596.78 about nine months ago,
and I'm sleeping better
598.89 than I ever have before.
600.81 So if you're interested
in upgrading your mattress
602.53 to one that's ideally
suited to your sleep needs,
604.95 go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
607.84 take their two-minutes sleep quiz,
609.2 and they'll match you to
a customized mattress.
611.1 And you'll get up to $200
off that mattress order,
614.99 and two free pillows.
616.88 They have a 10-year warranty
and you get to try out
618.77 the mattress for a 100 nights risk-free,
620.69 they'll even pick it up for
you if you don't love it,
622.36 but I think you really will love it.
624.1 So again, if you're interested,
625.13 go to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off
628.75 and two free pillows.
630.36 Today's episode is also brought
to us by Athletic Greens.
633.45 Athletic Greens is an
634.51 all-in-one vitamin
mineral probiotic drink.
637.49 I started drinking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.
640.837 And so I'm delighted that
they're sponsoring the podcast.
643.64 The reason I started
drinking Athletic Greens
645.327 and the reason why I still drink
it once or even twice a day
648.8 is because it takes care of all
650.6 my foundational nutritional needs.
653.33 It includes vitamins,
minerals, and probiotics
655.82 which are important
for the gut microbiome,
659.54 this colony of bacteria,
661.21 healthy bacteria that we
all have living in our guts.
663.76 And when that bacteria is healthy,
666.029 our brain functions better,
667.62 our immune system functions better.
669.01 There is now a lot of
research to support that.
671.88 Athletic Greens taste delicious.
673.65 I mix mine with water and a
little bit of lemon juice.
676.48 And as I mentioned, I drink
it once or twice a day,
678.94 usually in the morning and
again in the afternoon.
681.67 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
683.48 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
686.79 and claim a special offer.
688.13 That special offer is a
year supply of vitamin D3K2.
692.36 There's now a robust literature
showing that vitamin D3
696.44 is critical for various
aspects of our health,
698.47 metabolic health, endocrine
health, et cetera.
701.22 And you'll also get
five free travel packs.
703.81 When you travel mixing up Athletic Greens
705.58 is made really easy by
these little travel packs.
707.59 You just put them in a jar
or other a water bottle,
710.55 mix it with water.
711.5 It's very easy to do on a
plane or in the et cetera.
714.13 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
716.86 to get the Athletic Greens,
the five free travel packs
719.34 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
722.35 So let's talk about pleasure and pain.
725.51 I think we all intuitively understand
727.4 what pleasure and pain are.
729.56 Pleasure generally is
a sensation in the body
732.22 and in the mind that
leads us to pursue more
736.28 of whatever is bringing
about that sensation.
739.5 And pain is also a sensation
in the body and in the mind
744.96 that in general leads
us to want to withdraw
748.17 or move away from some
activity or interaction.
751.87 That's not always the case.
753.12 Some people actively seek out pain.
755.49 Some people somehow
can't seem to engage with
759.42 or experience pleasure,
760.9 but most people operate on this
basis of pleasure and pain.
765.13 Scientists would call
this appetitive behaviors,
768.32 meaning behaviors that lead
us to create an appetite
771.73 for more of those behaviors
and aversive behaviors,
775.61 behaviors that make us want
to move away from something.
778.8 The simplest example of
that would be putting your
781.14 hand near a hot flame, at some point,
783.8 there would be a reflex or a deep desire
786.57 to withdraw your hand.
788.77 Tasting something delicious
in general makes us want
791.29 to eat more of that thing.
793.12 Interactions with other
people that we find delicious,
796.03 also make us want to interact
with those people more.
798.75 None of this is complicated
or sophisticated.
801.33 This is simply to illustrate
the fact that pleasure and pain
805.64 tend to evoke opposite responses,
807.72 opposite behavioral responses
809.35 and opposite emotional responses.
811.49 So how does that come about?
813.18 Well, it really comes
about by an interaction
816.12 that starts at one end of
our body, meaning our skin
820.22 and the other end of
the organs of our body,
822.97 which is deep within the brain.
824.69 So let's consider these
two ends of the spectrum
827.51 of pleasure and pain
and what they contribute
830.46 to those experiences of pleasure and pain.
834.21 The organ that we call the
skin, as I mentioned earlier,
836.63 is the largest organ in our body.
838.91 And throughout that
organ, we have neurons,
842.19 little nerve cells.
843.3 Now to be really technical about it,
845.04 and the way I'd like you to understand it
847.06 is that the so-called cell
body meaning the location
850.44 of a cell in which the
DNA and other goodies
853.08 the kind of central factory of the cell,
855.54 that actually sits right
outside your spinal cord.
858.34 So all up and down your
spinal cord on either side
861.855 are these little blobs of neurons,
864.48 little collections of neurons.
865.96 They have a name if you'd like to know
867.36 for you aficionado or
those who are curious,
869.37 they're called DRGs dorsal root ganglia.
873.22 A ganglion is just a
collection or clump of cells.
877.18 And those DRGs are really
interesting because they send
880.67 one branch that we call an axon,
883.44 a little wire out to our
skin, also to our muscles
887.2 into our organs, but here
we're talking about the skin.
889.54 They send a wire out to our
skin and that wire literally
893.43 reaches up into the skin.
895.29 It's actually in our skin
and they have another wire
899.03 from that same cell body
900.43 that goes in the opposite direction,
901.61 which is up to our brain
and creates connections
905.99 within our brain in the
so-called brainstem.
908.52 What this means is that
the neuron in your body
913.51 that we call the DRG
that sends a wire an axon
917.99 to sense what's going on in your big toe
921.52 and then sends another axon
in the opposite direction
924.24 into the base of your brain,
925.71 that is the largest cell in
your entire body of any kind.
929.9 Fat cell, muscle cell,
nerve cell, et cetera.
933.09 Is extremely long cells.
934.78 It can be a meter or more depending
936.58 on how tall you happen to be.
938.21 So we have these cells that have wires
939.671 they go off in two different directions
941.403 and the wire that's within
our skin will respond
944.888 to any number of different
categories of stimuli.
950.07 These wires are positioned within the skin
953.02 to respond to mechanical forces.
955.62 So maybe light touch,
957.12 some will only send electrical activity up
961.03 toward the brain in
response to light touch.
964.5 Meaning if you press on
the skin really hard,
966.65 they don't respond.
967.81 You stroke the skin lightly
with your fingertips
970.31 or a feather and they
respond very robustly.
973.65 Others respond to course
pressure, the hard pressure,
977.11 but they won't respond to a
light feather, for instance.
981.35 Others respond to temperature.
983.4 So they will respond
to the presence of heat
985.948 or the presence of cold or
changes in heat and cold.
990.04 And still others respond
to other types of stimuli,
993.18 like certain chemicals on our skin.
995.86 Many of you have probably
experienced the sensation
998.38 of eating a hot pepper.
1000.17 Well, I don't recommend doing this,
1001.65 but were you to take a
little slice of jalapeno
1004.21 or other hot pepper, habanero
pepper or something like that
1007.09 and rub it on your skin, you
would actually feel something
1010.48 at that location.
1012.17 And that's because that
pepper doesn't just create
1015.13 a sensation within your mouth,
1016.62 it will create a similar
sensation on your skin.
1020.03 So these neurons are amazing.
1021.35 They're collecting information
of particular kinds
1024.35 from the skin throughout the entire body
1026.95 and sending that information
up toward the brain.
1030.14 And what's really incredible,
1032.0 I just want you to
ponder this for a second.
1034.07 What's really incredible
is that the language
1035.95 that those neurons use
is exactly the same.
1038.86 The neuron that responds to light touch
1041.35 sends electrical signals
up toward the brain,
1043.81 the neurons that respond
to cold or to heat
1047.26 or to habanero pepper, they only respond
1050.98 to the particular thing that
evokes the electrical response.
1056.87 I should say that they only respond
1058.93 to the particular stimulus, the pepper,
1061.32 the cold, the heat, et cetera,
1062.84 that will evoke an electrical signal,
1065.49 but the electrical signals
are a common language
1068.07 that all neurons use.
1069.38 And yet, if something cold
is presented to your skin,
1073.11 like an ice cube, even if
you don't see that ice cube,
1076.41 if your eyes are closed, or
someone comes up behind you
1078.77 and puts an ice cube
against your bare skin back,
1082.5 you know that that sensation,
that thing is cold.
1085.96 You don't misperceive it as
heat or as a habanero pepper.
1090.43 So that's amazing.
1091.37 What that means is that
there must be another element
1094.68 in the equation of what
creates pleasure or pain.
1097.92 And that element is your brain.
1100.72 Your brain takes these electrical signals
1102.5 and interprets them.
1103.95 Partially based on experience,
1105.78 but also there are some
innate meaning some hard wired
1109.65 aspects of pain and pleasure sensing
1111.61 that require no experience whatsoever.
1113.91 A child doesn't have to fall down but once
1117.44 to know on that first fall, that hurt.
1120.2 They don't have to touch a flame,
1121.4 but once and the very first
time they will withdraw
1123.96 their hand from the flame.
1125.92 So no prior experiences required.
1128.56 Other things prior experience is required.
1131.2 For instance, if you're somebody that has
1133.48 an intense, intense
aversion to spicy foods,
1136.94 that's probably because you've
tasted spicy foods before.
1140.44 Likewise, if you really like sweet foods,
1143.07 it's probably because
you've tasted them before.
1145.46 So you can start to make predictions
1146.77 based on prior experience,
1147.96 but the pain and pleasure system
1149.29 don't need prior experience.
1151.6 What they need is a
brain that can interpret
1153.66 these electrical signals
1154.7 that can take these electrical
signals and somehow create
1158.11 what we call pleasure
and pain out of them.
1161.16 So what parts of the brain?
1162.75 Well, mainly it's the
so-called somatosensory cortex.
1166.31 The portion of our neocortex,
1168.74 which is on the outside of our brain,
1169.743 that kind of bumpy part, not kind of
1171.98 if you have a normally formed
brain, it will be bumpy.
1174.9 If you have a smooth
brain that's not good.
1177.01 Some animals just have a smooth brain.
1178.74 Humans have a bumpy brain,
1179.715 which means it has a
very large surface area.
1181.347 And those bumps are 'cause
you squeezed it like a pizza
1184.21 and clump and you bunched it all up
1185.82 and put inside the skull.
1187.48 That's good.
1188.313 That means you have a lot of neurons.
1189.99 And in your somatosensory cortex,
1192.31 you have a map of your
entire body surface.
1194.69 That map is called a homunculus.
1197.65 And if we were to take your cortex
1199.9 and lay it out on a table,
1201.55 I've actually done this with the cortices
1203.38 of various animals and humans included.
1207.07 What you would find is that
there's literally a map
1210.09 of your entire body surface.
1212.199 But it wouldn't look exactly like you,
1215.01 this map would be very distorted.
1218.05 Why would it be distorted?
1219.36 Well, certain areas of your body
1221.69 have a much denser
innervation as we call it,
1224.98 or put simply many more
of these sensory wires
1228.92 from these DRGs within your skin.
1231.3 So this map of you that
exists in your brain,
1233.67 and you do have one of these
on each side of your brain,
1236.31 so you have two of
these maps to homunculi,
1239.67 that is you, it's your
representation of touch
1242.39 including pleasure and pain.
1244.23 And in that map, your lips are enormous.
1248.73 And your back is very, very small.
1251.74 And the area around your eyes
1253.43 and the area representing your
face is absolutely enormous.
1257.45 So you would look like some
sort of odd, weird clay doll
1260.44 from some sort of bizarre
late night animation thing.
1263.43 And just imagine the
psychedelic experience of that
1267.74 character of you and that's
what it would look like.
1270.5 But it's not randomly organized.
1272.56 To the contrary, it's highly organized
1275.24 in a very particular way,
1277.09 which is that the areas of your skin
1279.58 that have the highest density
of the sensory receptors
1283.99 are magnified in your brain.
1286.68 So it's sort of like having more pixels
1289.72 in a certain part of a camera than others,
1292.86 and in doing that
allowing higher resolution
1295.94 in this case of touch, not a vision,
1298.5 but of touch sensation in
certain parts of your body.
1302.39 What are the areas that are magnified?
1304.38 Well, the lips, the face,
the tips of the fingers,
1308.61 the feet, and the genitals.
1311.13 And so this map of you
has very large lips, face,
1315.46 tips of fingers, bottoms
of feet, and genitals.
1318.31 And that's because the innervation,
1320.89 the number of wires that go
into those regions of your body
1325.21 far exceeds the number of
wires for sensation of touch
1329.33 that go to other areas of your body.
1332.43 You can actually experience
this in real time right now
1336.51 by doing a simple experiment that we call
1338.46 two-point discrimination.
1340.44 Two-points discrimination is your ability
1343.03 to know whether or not
two points of pressure
1346.41 are far apart, near each other,
1349.92 or you actually could perceive incorrectly
1353.27 as one point of pressure.
1355.37 You might want a second
person to do this experiment.
1358.66 Here's how you would do it.
1359.64 You will close your eyes,
1360.96 that person would take two fine points.
1363.45 Don't make them too sharp, please.
1364.81 So it could be two pencils
or pens or the backs of pens.
1367.8 Two pens I'm holding in my hands.
1369.21 If you're just listening to
this, I'm just holding two pens.
1372.3 My favorite pens, these
pilot, V5 or V7, which I love.
1376.14 If you were to close your eyes
1378.2 and I were to take these two pens
1380.61 and put their points close
together about a centimeter apart
1383.76 and present them to the top of your hand,
1385.68 I'm going to just going
to do that now to myself.
1387.41 You, even though your eyes were closed,
1389.21 you would be able to perceive
that that was two points
1391.52 of pressure presented simultaneously
1393.74 to the top of your hand.
1395.3 However, if I were to do this
to the middle of your back,
1398.92 you would not experience them
as two points of pressure.
1401.68 You would experience them as
one single point of pressure.
1405.1 In other words, your two point
discrimination is better,
1407.9 is higher on areas of your body
1410.89 which have many, many
more sensory receptors.
1413.75 You are more sensitive at those locations.
1416.289 Now this makes perfect
sense once you experience it
1419.07 or you hear about it.
1420.47 However, most of us
don't really appreciate
1422.81 how important and what a
profound influence this change
1426.43 in density of receptors
across our body surface has.
1430.06 And we can go a step further
and describe another feature
1432.64 of the way that you're built and the way
1434.29 that you experience pleasure and pain,
1436.06 which is called the dermatome.
1438.16 The dermatome is literally the way
1440.89 in which your body surface is carved up
1444.23 into different territories.
1446.2 Much like a map of the
United States is carved up
1448.9 into different territories
1449.94 of states and counties, et cetera.
1452.24 The dermatome is the way in which neurons
1456.04 connect to different parts of your body.
1458.53 Now, you've actually experienced
the dermatome before.
1461.53 The dermatome is when you have a neuron
1464.15 that connects to a
particular area of the body
1466.57 and that neuron doesn't just
send one little wire out
1469.73 like one little line
and go up into the skin
1471.96 to detect mechanical, or
thermal, or chemical stimuli.
1474.95 It actually sends many
branches out like a tree.
1477.8 But remember those
branches of the tree come
1480.1 from one single neuron.
1482.47 Now, occasionally what will
happen is you will experience
1485.8 something like cold, or
heat, or pain, or tingling
1490.74 on a patch of your body.
1492.69 And occasionally that patch
of body will actually have
1495.83 a very cleanly demarcated boundary,
1498.45 a very stark boundary
with the areas around it.
1502.06 A good example of this would
be the herpes simplex 1 virus,
1505.57 which if one has this virus,
1507.369 and I should mention that
somewhere between 80 and 90%
1510.69 of people have this virus,
1512.16 this is not a sexually transmitted virus.
1514.13 This is a virus is transmitted
very easily between people
1517.88 through various forms of
contact non-sexual contact,
1520.7 it's present in children,
it's present in adults
1522.88 and most people get it, some
get symptoms and some don't
1526.23 some get recurring symptoms, some don't.
1528.13 We can talk about that
at the end, if you like,
1530.72 but this virus lives on what's called
1533.49 the fifth cranial nerve also
called the trigeminal nerve.
1536.19 The trigeminal nerve sends
branches out to the lips,
1540.58 to the eyes, and to certain
portions of the face.
1543.09 So for those of you listening,
1544.13 I've just kind of put my
right hand across my face
1546.85 and to sort of simulate
the three branches,
1549.27 the trigeminal aspect of this nerve.
1552.54 So tri three.
1554.2 Now, when the herpes virus
flares up, as they say,
1557.91 in response to stress or other factors,
1560.95 the virus inflames that nerve
1563.45 and people experience tingling
and pain on the nerve.
1567.99 Sometimes they'll get a
cold sore or a blister
1570.23 on their lip or near their mouth,
1571.89 sometimes they'll get
a collection of those.
1573.59 And that's because that
dermatome is actually inflamed.
1577.89 Now other people will experience
something like shingles.
1581.8 It's a fairly common viral infection.
1585.72 And what they'll notice
is they'll get a rash
1587.89 that has a boundary.
1588.9 It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps,
1590.33 sometimes blisters, and
it'll have a sharp boundary.
1593.23 That boundary exists because
the virus exists on the nerve.
1597.9 And so it actually is boundaried
1601.09 with the neighboring area of the body
1603.45 that's receiving input from another nerve
1606.75 and that one doesn't have
the virus living on it.
1609.21 So anytime you see a rash or
a pattern on the body surface
1613.18 on the skin that has a
pretty stark boundary,
1615.71 chances are that's an event
that's impacting the dermatome.
1620.35 I've experienced this before
1621.78 then not through herpes simplex,
1623.13 but through the experience
of having a lot of blood
1627.65 sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment
1629.9 across the front of my
face, it was really bizarre.
1631.73 I looked in the mirror and I
thought, what is going on here?
1633.44 I was having an allergic
reaction to something I'd eaten.
1636.45 And that allergic reaction
clearly was affecting one
1639.89 of the nerves and therefore the dermatome
1641.85 and what it showed up was,
1643.19 it was almost like someone
had drawn lines on my face
1645.93 that said, okay, this rash
or this reaction rather
1649.13 can happen here, but not in
a region right next to it.
1652.5 Whenever you see that chances are
1654.4 it's a reaction of the
nerves of the dermatome.
1657.81 So you'll start to see
these things more and more
1660.11 when you start to look for them.
1661.392 You don't always have to
have a viral infection
1663.38 to experience this.
1664.213 Sometimes you'll just experience tingling
1666.15 or even a pleasant sensation,
1668.02 and it will be restricted
in kind of a strict boundary
1671.32 on one location or your body
surface and not another.
1674.5 Not corresponding to an organ like,
1677.3 okay, this arm or just your
feet or something like that.
1681.64 But just a segment.
1682.73 It's almost like someone
outlined a particular area
1685.06 of her body surface.
1686.21 That's the dermatome.
1687.81 So you've got sensors in the skin
1690.064 and you've got a brain
that's going to interpret
1692.69 what's going on with those sensors.
1695.01 In fact, we can take an
example of a sudden rash
1698.17 or inflammation at one
location, the dermatome,
1700.77 and we can ask what would make it hurt?
1704.12 What would make it worse?
1705.96 What would make it go away?
1707.83 And believe it or not, your
subjective interpretation
1711.21 of what's happening has
a profound influence
1714.7 on your experience of pleasure or pain.
1718.07 There are several things that
can impact these experiences,
1721.18 but the main categories are expectation.
1724.86 So sort of whether or not
you thought or could expect
1727.9 that this thing was
going to happen, right?
1730.64 If someone tells you
this is going to hurt,
1732.54 I'm going to give you
an injection right here,
1734.28 it might hurt for a second.
1735.6 That's very different and
your experience of that pain
1737.52 will be very different than
if it happened suddenly
1739.47 out of the blue.
1740.95 There's also anxiety, how anxious,
1742.87 or how high or low your level
of arousal, autonomic arousal,
1747.29 that's going to impact your
experience of pleasure or pain.
1751.6 How well you slept and where you are
1754.87 in the so-called circadian
or 24-hour cycle.
1758.44 Our ability to tolerate
pain changes dramatically
1762.4 across the 24-hour cycle.
1764.2 And as you can imagine is
during the daylight waking hours
1767.47 that we are better able to tolerate,
1769.77 we are more resilient to pain,
1772.04 and we are better able
to experience pleasure.
1775.98 At night our threshold
for pain is much lower.
1779.97 In other words, the amount of mechanical
1783.22 or chemical or thermal
meaning temperature stimulated
1785.98 that can evoke a pain response
and how we rate that response
1789.83 is much lower at night.
1793.13 And in particular, in the hours
between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM,
1797.37 if you're on a kind of
standard circadian schedule.
1800.12 And then the last one is our genes.
1802.85 Pain threshold and how
long a pain response lasts
1807.21 is in part dictated by our genes.
1809.49 And later I'm going to discuss this myth
1812.54 or whether or not it's really a myth
1815.2 as to whether or not certain
people in particular red heads,
1818.33 people who have reg
pigmented hair and fair skin,
1822.603 whether or not their
pain thresholds differ.
1824.97 And to just give you a
little sneak peek into that,
1827.5 indeed they do and it's
because of a genetic difference
1830.281 in a particular gene, in a
particular pattern of receptors
1833.78 in the skin that are
related to the pigmentation
1838.46 of hair and skin.
1840.09 So we have expectation,
anxiety, how well we've slept,
1843.43 where we are in the so-called
24-hour circadian time
1847.3 and our genes.
1849.77 So let's talk about
expectation and anxiety
1852.66 because those two factors
can powerfully modulate
1855.92 our experience of both pleasure and pain
1858.2 in ways that will allow us to
dial up pleasure if we like
1863.55 and to dial down pain, if indeed
that's what we want to do.
1867.34 So let's talk about
expectation and anxiety
1869.84 because those two things
are somewhat tethered.
1872.659 There are now a number
of solid experiments,
1875.47 both in animal models and in humans
1878.57 that point to the fact that
if we know a painful stimulus
1882.31 is coming, that we can better
prepare for it mentally
1886.49 and therefore buffer or
reduce the pain response.
1890.48 However, the timing in which
that anticipation occurs
1895.15 is vital for this to happen.
1897.61 And if that timing isn't quite right,
1900.03 it actually can make the
experience of pain far worse.
1903.63 So here I'm summarizing a
large amount of literature,
1906.78 but essentially if subjects are warned
1909.49 that a painful stimulus is coming,
1911.83 their subjective experience of
that pain is vastly reduced.
1917.73 However, if they are
warned just two seconds
1921.25 before that pain arrives,
it does not help.
1924.53 It actually makes it worse.
1926.13 And the reason is they
can't do anything mentally
1928.32 to prepare for it in that
brief two second window.
1932.25 Similarly, if they are warned
about pain that's coming
1935.9 two minutes before a
painful stimulus is coming
1938.67 electric shock or a poke or
cold stimulus or heat stimulus
1942.63 that's pretty extreme,
that also makes it worse
1945.95 because their expectation
ramps up the autonomic arousal.
1950.09 The level of alertness
is all funneled toward
1953.62 that negative experience that's coming.
1956.69 So how soon before a painful stimulus
1960.68 should we know about it if the goal is
1963.16 to reduce our level of pain?
1965.91 And the answer is somewhere
between 20 seconds
1969.72 and 40 seconds is about right.
1972.07 Now, I'm averaging across a
number of different studies,
1974.7 but if you have about
20 seconds or 40 seconds
1978.77 advance warning that
something bad is coming,
1981.13 you can prepare yourself for that,
1983.26 but the preparation itself and the arousal
1985.249 that comes with it,
the kind of leaning in,
1987.07 okay, I'm either going to relax myself
1989.48 or I'm going to really
kind of dig my heels in
1991.83 and kind of meet the pain head on.
1994.303 That seems to be the optimal window.
1996.66 This can come and useful
in a variety of contexts,
1999.39 but I think it's important
because what it illustrates
2003.32 is that it absolutely cannot
be just the pattern of signals
2007.43 that are arriving from
the skin, from these DRGs,
2011.55 these neurons that connect to skin
2013.52 that dictates our experience
of pain or pleasure.
2016.85 There has to be a subjective
interpretation component,
2020.44 and indeed that's the case.
2021.99 So let's talk about the
range of pain experiences.
2026.3 And from that, we will understand better
2028.13 what the range of pleasure experiences are
2030.383 that different people have
because we are all different
2033.3 in terms of our pain threshold.
2035.1 First of all, what is pain threshold?
2037.22 Pain threshold has two dimensions.
2039.39 The first dimension is the
amount of mechanical or chemical
2044.43 or thermal stimulation
that it takes for you or me
2047.84 or somebody else to say,
I can't take that anymore.
2050.35 I'm done.
2051.62 But there's another element as well
2053.19 which is how long the pain persists.
2056.12 I'll just describe myself for example,
2058.39 I don't consider myself somebody
2060.16 who has a particularly
high pain threshold.
2062.53 I don't think it's
particularly low either,
2064.24 but I wouldn't consider myself somebody
2065.66 that has a particularly
high pain threshold.
2068.31 When I stubbed my toe against
the corner of the bed,
2070.97 it absolutely hurts.
2072.86 But one thing that I've noticed is
2074.13 that I have very sharp
inflections, very high inflections
2078.39 in my perception of pain, and
then they go away quickly.
2081.46 I don't know if that's adaptive or not.
2082.94 It's probably not,
2084.17 but my experience of pain is
very intense, but very brief.
2088.43 Other people experience pain in a much
2091.11 kind of slower rising,
but longer-lasting manner.
2094.69 And to just really point
out how varied we all are
2097.76 in terms of our experience of pain,
2099.7 let's look to an experiment.
2101.92 There been experiments done
at Stanford School of Medicine
2104.62 and elsewhere, which
involved having subjects
2107.77 put their hand into a
very cold vat of water
2110.91 and measuring the amount of time
2112.45 that they kept their hand in that water.
2114.32 And then they would tell the
experimenter very quietly,
2117.99 how painful that particular stimulus was
2120.99 on a scale of one to 10
so-called Likert scale
2123.54 for your aficionados.
2126.38 That simple experiment
revealed that people experience
2130.73 the same thermal in this
case, cold stimulus,
2135.13 vastly different.
2136.47 Some people would rate it as
a 10 out of 10 extreme pain.
2140.28 Other people would rate it
as barely painful at all,
2143.04 like a one.
2143.89 Other people, a three other
people, a five, et cetera.
2147.38 Now what's interesting is
that the same thing is true
2150.3 for experience of a hot, painful stimulus
2153.59 120 degree hot plate, where you
have to put your hand on it,
2156.474 and then at some point
you remove your hand.
2158.79 Some people are able to keep their hand
2159.739 on there the whole time, but
people rate that experience
2163.84 as very painful, a little bit painful
2166.7 or moderately painful
depending on who they are.
2170.44 Now, that's interesting,
2171.78 probably not that surprising, however,
2174.39 but what is very interesting is that
2176.13 when the same experiment
was done on medical doctors
2179.72 or medical doctors in training,
2181.68 they too of course experienced pain
2184.55 through a range of subjective experiences.
2187.25 Some of them just like any
other person off the street
2190.99 said a particular stimulus
of a particular temperature
2193.81 was very painful, other said
it wasn't painful at all
2195.817 and some said it was moderately painful.
2198.45 And that turns out to be vitally important
2200.63 for the treatment of pain
2203.13 because pain is not an event in the skin.
2205.87 Pain is a subjective,
emotional experience.
2209.23 You may have heard that we
have a particular category
2211.917 of these DRGs that innervate the skin,
2214.44 which are called nociceptors.
2216.562 Nociceptor comes from the word
noci, nocere I believe it is,
2221.09 which means to harm.
2222.69 However, nociceptors don't
carry information about pain,
2226.16 they carry information about
particular types of stimuli
2229.07 impacting the skin.
2230.49 And then the brain assigns
a value of valence to it,
2234.15 a label and says that's painful.
2236.53 And where people draw the
line between not painful
2238.91 and painful varies.
2240.45 Now, because physicians are people
2243.21 and because physicians treat pain,
2245.62 what we know from a lot of data
now is that if someone comes
2250.24 into the clinic and says they're
experiencing chronic pain
2252.99 or whole body pain or
acute pain after an injury
2255.6 or one location, it doesn't
really matter what the cause is
2258.33 or even if there's a cause at all,
2261.62 how the doctor reacts to that
report of the patient's pain
2266.69 will dictate in many cases
the course of treatment.
2269.49 And of course doctors, their
goal is to treat the patient
2272.59 to going to the patient's
needs, not their own.
2274.74 And that's what good doctors do.
2277.02 However, it's been found and
I think now there is work
2280.48 being done to try and change this,
2283.32 but if a doctor has a very
high threshold for pain,
2287.57 their interpretation of
somebody else's report of pain
2290.27 is going to be different.
2291.3 They might not discount
the patient, right?
2293.68 This doesn't necessarily
mean that they think, oh,
2295.65 this person their pain is
irrelevant, probably not.
2298.87 In fact, from having a
high threshold for pain,
2301.58 if someone comes in and
says, I'm in extreme pain,
2304.39 that doctor probably thinks,
2305.69 wow, this has to be
really, really extreme,
2308.24 but they can be talking about
two different experiences.
2311.83 Similarly, if a physician has
a very low threshold for pain,
2315.44 and someone comes in and says,
2318.859 yeah, I'm experiencing
some pain in my back.
2321.21 I've got the sciatica thing, but yeah,
2323.46 it's a little bit uncomfortable.
2324.85 It's like a, I don't know
like a four out of 10.
2327.59 Well, that physician might
interpret that four out of 10
2330.72 as a pretty extreme sense of pain
2334.2 or pretty extreme experience of pain.
2336.22 And so you can start to see
how the subjective nature
2338.99 of pain can start to have real impact
2341.76 on the treatment of pain
because treatment of pain
2344.18 is carried out by physicians.
2345.76 In fact, there is no
objective measure of pain.
2349.96 We can ask how long
somebody can keep their hand
2351.82 on a hot plate or in a cold bath.
2353.84 You can do various experiments.
2355.213 They even have some extreme experiments
2357.49 where they'll shave a portion of the leg
2360.22 and they'll put on a very
painful chemical compound
2363.82 and see how long people can tolerate that.
2365.51 These are very uncomfortable
experiments as you can imagine,
2368.46 but in general, we don't have a way
2370.35 of measuring somebody else's
subjective experience of pain.
2374.07 There is no blood pressure measure.
2375.81 There's no heart rate beats
per minute measure of pain.
2378.601 So one of the great
efforts of neuroscience
2381.76 and of medicine is to try and come up
2382.91 with more objective measures of pain.
2386.04 Similarly, pleasure is something
that we all talk about.
2389.26 Ooh, that feels so good, or I love that
2391.54 or more of that please or less of that,
2394.04 but we have no way of
gauging what other people
2397.05 are experiencing except what
they report through language.
2400.92 And so this is really just to illustrate
2403.03 that this whole thing around
pain isn't a black box.
2405.69 We do have an understanding
of the elements.
2407.9 There are elements in the skin,
2408.74 there's elements of the brain,
2409.87 there's expectation,
anxiety, sleep, and genes,
2412.57 but that it is very complicated.
2415.44 And yet there are certain principles
2417.29 that fall out of that complicated picture
2419.77 that can allow us to better
understand and navigate
2422.49 this axis that we call
the pleasure-pain axis.
2425.56 So rather than focus on just
the subjective nature of pain,
2428.84 let's talk about the
absolute qualities of pain
2432.27 and the absolute qualities of pleasure
2435.1 so that we can learn how to
navigate those two experiences
2438.68 in ways that serve us each better.
2441.9 First of all, I want to
talk about heat and cold.
2444.79 We do indeed have sensors in our skin
2446.52 that respond to heat and cold.
2448.54 And for any of you that
have entered a cold shower
2452.09 or a cold body of water of any
kind or ice bath, et cetera,
2456.95 you will realize that getting
into cold is much harder
2461.4 if you do it slowly.
2463.24 Now, despite that people
tend to do it very slowly.
2466.94 I have noticed an enormous
variation with which people
2470.42 can embrace the experience of cold.
2473.45 I noticed it because I do
some work with athletes
2476.43 and I do some work with military
2477.65 and I do some work with
the general public.
2479.51 And one of the best tests of
how somebody can handle pain
2483.94 is to ask them to just
get into an ice bath.
2487.21 It's not a very sophisticated experience,
2489.01 but it really gets into the
core of the kind of circuitry
2491.32 that we're talking about, both
in the skin and in the brain.
2495.25 Some people regardless of
sex, regardless of age,
2499.86 and regardless of physical ability
2502.89 can just get into the cold.
2505.65 They're somehow able to do it.
2506.86 Now, I don't know what their
experience of the cold is.
2508.84 And neither do you.
2509.673 You only know your experience,
2511.245 but they're able to do that.
2513.4 Some do it quickly, some do it slowly.
2516.01 Others find the experience
of cold to be so aversive
2519.58 that they somehow cannot
get themselves in.
2521.83 They start quaking, they start complaining
2524.49 and many of them just simply get out.
2526.86 They can't do it.
2527.693 Some don't even get in past their knees.
2529.88 This isn't necessarily
about pain threshold,
2532.08 but it's related to that.
2534.54 I think it can be helpful
to everyone to know
2537.06 that even though it feels
better at a mental level
2540.44 to get into the cold
slowly and people ask, oh,
2543.46 I just want to get in slowly,
I want to take my time.
2546.211 It is actually much worse
2547.96 from a neuro-biological perspective.
2550.32 The neurons that sense cold respond
2552.87 to what are called relative
drops in temperature.
2556.31 So it's not about the absolute
temperature of the water.
2559.82 It's about the relative
change in temperature.
2563.53 So as you move from a
particular temperature,
2566.3 whether or not it's in the
air next to an ice bath
2568.36 or cold shower, or from a
body of water that's warm
2571.35 to a body of water that's colder,
2573.17 or sometimes in the ocean,
you'll notice it's warm.
2574.755 And then as you swim out further,
2576.69 you'll get into a pocket of
water where it's much colder.
2579.33 That's when the cold receptors
in your skin start firing
2582.37 and sending signals up to your brain.
2584.8 Therefore, you can bypass
these signals going up
2589.21 to the brain with each relative
change one degree change,
2592.45 two degrees change, et cetera,
2594.62 by simply getting in all at once.
2597.14 In fact it is true and maybe
you've been told this before,
2599.94 and it is true that if
you get into cold water
2602.51 up to your neck,
2603.93 it's actually much more comfortable
2605.37 than if you're halfway in and halfway out.
2607.41 And that's because of the
difference in the signals
2609.81 that are being sent
from the cold receptors
2611.95 on your upper torso,
2612.91 which is out of the water
in your lower torso.
2615.0 Now, I wouldn't want anyone to take this
2617.31 to mean that they should just jump
2618.47 into an unknown body of water.
2619.83 There are all sorts of
factors like currents,
2621.95 and if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed.
2624.34 You can stop the heart.
2625.29 People can have heart attacks from getting
2626.83 into extremely cold water,
like a melted mountain stream
2632.3 that's been frozen all winter,
2633.69 or has been very, very cold or
as a snow pack going into it.
2637.49 If very cold, you can
indeed have a heart attack.
2639.63 So please be smart about
how cold and what bodies
2643.29 of cold water you happen
to put yourself into.
2645.63 But it is absolutely true
that provided it safe,
2648.15 getting into a cold water
is always going to be easier
2651.22 to do quickly and is going to be easier
2653.4 to do up to your neck.
2655.07 In fact, you actually want to
get your shoulders submerged.
2658.01 There are a number of
other things you can do
2659.69 if you really want and it's safe to do.
2661.41 You can put your face under and activate
2663.53 the so-called dive reflex,
which also makes the tolerance
2666.92 of cold easier believe it or not.
2669.0 So it's very counterintuitive.
2670.21 It's like getting into water
faster and more completely
2673.54 you will experience as less
uncomfortable, less cold.
2676.72 And indeed that's the case.
2678.34 And that's because these cold receptors
2680.63 are measuring every relative
drop in temperature.
2683.87 So every single one is
graded as we say in biology,
2687.38 it's not absolute.
2689.67 As an additional point, if
you're sitting in a body
2692.36 of cold water and it's not circulating,
2694.4 you'll notice that you start
to warm up a little bit.
2697.09 Or even if you feel like
you're freezing cold,
2699.49 if you move and that water
around you moves, of course,
2702.87 then you'll notice it's got even colder.
2704.91 And that's because
there's a thermal layer.
2706.5 You're actually heating up the water
2708.27 that surrounds your body
2709.27 like a halo around every
aspect of your body.
2712.88 A sort of silhouette of you of heat
2714.78 where you're heating that water.
2716.1 When you move, you disrupt
that thermal layer.
2719.82 Now heat is the opposite.
2722.1 Heat and the heat receptors in your skin
2724.29 respond to absolute
changes in temperature.
2726.86 And this is probably because our body
2729.4 and our brain can tolerate
drops in temperature
2732.1 much better than it can tolerate
2733.788 increases in temperature safely.
2736.58 So when you move from say a
standard outdoor environment,
2740.25 I mean, here in the States
2741.11 we measure in terms of Fahrenheit.
2742.71 So maybe it's a 75 or an 80
degree, or even 90 degree day,
2746.15 and you get into a 100 degrees sauna,
2748.78 or if you're in a cool
air conditioned building
2750.7 and you go outside and
it's very warm outside,
2753.34 you sort of feel like the heat
hits you all at once, boom.
2756.45 Hits you all at once, kind
of like a slap in the face,
2759.73 but then it will just stay at that level.
2761.65 Your body will acclimate to
that particular temperature.
2765.5 However, if that temperature
is very, very high,
2768.37 you'll notice that your
experience of that heat
2771.1 and your experience of
kind of pain and discomfort
2773.64 and your desire to get out of that heat
2776.11 will tend to persist.
2777.25 You don't really adapt in the same way.
2779.57 And certain people who are really good
2781.23 at handling very hot
sauna, get better at this.
2783.62 You learned to calm your
breathing, et cetera,
2786.14 lower your autonomic arousal.
2788.21 Obviously you don't want to
let your body temperature
2789.95 go too high because
neurons cook, they die.
2792.67 If neurons die, they don't
come back and that's bad.
2795.66 Many people unfortunately harm
themselves with hyperthermia.
2799.36 Everyone has a different threshold
for this, but in general,
2802.57 you don't want your body
temperature to go up too high.
2804.64 That's why a fever of like 103 starts
2806.72 to become worrisome 104.
2808.45 You really get concerned if and it goes
2810.94 up into that range or higher,
2812.49 that's when you need to
really cool down the body
2814.61 or get to hospital so
they can cool you down.
2818.41 Heat is measured in absolute
terms by the neurons.
2822.41 So gradually moving into heat makes sense,
2825.62 and finding that threshold,
2826.87 which is safe and comfortable for you,
2828.98 or if it's uncomfortable,
2830.18 at least resides within
that realm of safety.
2833.68 So that's heat and cold,
2835.0 and those are sort of non-negotiables.
2837.22 You can try and lower
your level of arousal.
2839.63 In fact, many people who
get into a cold shower
2841.797 and ice bath I think the recommendation
2843.77 that I always give is that
2845.62 you have two possible approaches to that.
2847.89 You can either try and relax yourself,
2849.59 kind of just stay calm within the cold,
2852.59 or you can lean into it.
2853.78 You can actually take mental steps
2857.82 to generate more adrenaline
2859.76 to kind of meet the demands of that cold.
2862.95 And at some point we'll
do a whole episode on
2864.96 how to use cold and heat
to certain advantages
2867.78 we've done a little bit
of this in past episodes
2870.59 using the cold to
supercharge human performance
2873.05 and things of that sort.
2874.27 But in general, cold is
measured in relative terms.
2877.671 And therefore getting in all
at once is a good idea provided
2880.828 you can do it safely.
2882.1 And heat is measured in absolute levels
2884.76 by your brain and body and therefore
2886.36 you want to actually
move into it gradually.
2888.1 So it's the kind of the inverse
of what you might think.
2891.35 One of the most important
things to understand
2893.65 about the experience of pain
and to really illustrate
2896.43 just how subjective pain really is,
2899.312 is that our experience of
pain and the degree of damage
2903.49 to our body are not always correlated.
2905.96 And in fact, sometimes can
be in opposite directions.
2909.4 A good example of this would be x-rays.
2911.82 We all occasionally get
x-rays at least in the US
2914.44 we get x-rays when we go to
the dentist from time to time,
2916.93 and the occasional x-ray might be safe
2919.28 depending on who you are
2920.38 provide you're not pregnant, et cetera.
2922.44 I've gone to the dentist.
2923.445 They put you in the chair,
2924.278 they cover you with the lead blanket,
2925.77 and then they run behind the
screen to protect themselves.
2929.84 And they beam me with the
x-rays to get a picture
2931.76 of your teeth and your jaws
and your skull, et cetera.
2934.58 Well, if you were to get too many x-rays,
2937.32 you could severely damage
the tissues of your body,
2940.4 but you don't experience any
pain during the x-ray itself.
2944.679 In contrast, you can think
that your body is damaged
2950.02 and experienced extreme pain
2952.79 and yet your body can have no damage.
2956.75 A classic example of this was published
2958.87 in the British Journal of Medicine,
2960.88 in which a construction worker fell from
2964.11 I think it was a second
story, which he was working
2967.48 and a nail went up and through his boot
2972.03 and he looked down and
he saw the nail going
2975.34 through his boot and he was
in absolute excruciating pain.
2980.497 They took him to the hospital
and because the nail was
2984.16 so long and because of
where it had entered,
2986.38 it exited the boot, they
had to cut away the boot
2989.61 in order to get to the nail.
2992.2 And when they did that,
2993.28 they revealed that the nail had passed
2995.13 between two of his toes.
2996.88 It had actually failed to
impale his body in any way.
3001.95 And yet the view, the
perception of that nail
3004.93 entering his boot at one
end and exiting the boot
3008.01 at the other was sufficient
to create the experience
3011.42 of a nail that had gone through his foot.
3014.36 And the moment he realized
that that nail had not gone
3017.64 through his foot, the pain
completely evaporated.
3020.8 And this has been
demonstrated numerous times.
3023.02 People that work in emergency rooms
3024.61 actually see variations on this.
3026.16 Not always that extreme,
3028.05 but many times what we see
and how we perceive that wound
3032.41 or that event has a profound influence
3034.94 on how we experience pain.
3036.65 And I mentioned this,
not just because it's a
3038.95 kind of sensational and fantastic example
3041.19 of this extreme,
subjective nature of pain,
3043.63 but also because it brings
us back to this element
3046.32 which is, we don't know
how other people feel.
3049.56 Not just about pain, but about pleasure.
3051.776 We think we do, we have some general sense
3055.33 of whether or not an event ought
3056.75 to be painful or pleasurable,
3058.83 but actually we barely
understand how we feel
3061.99 let alone how other people feel,
3063.69 and we can be badly
wrong about how we feel
3067.3 meaning we can misinterpret
our own sense of pain
3071.05 or our own sense of pleasure
depending on what we see
3073.92 with our eyes and what
we hear with our ears.
3077.39 So we hear a scream like a shrill scream,
3081.0 and we think it must be pain.
3082.86 And if we look at something
that's happening to somebody
3084.93 and it fits a prior category
or a prior representation
3088.51 of what we would consider
painful stimulus,
3091.17 well, then we think that
they're an extreme pain,
3094.25 but actually they might
not be in pain at all.
3096.66 Now this highly subjective nature of pain
3099.32 and the way in which we
use our visual system
3101.65 to interpret other people's
pain and our own pain
3105.08 has actually been leveraged
to treat a very extreme form
3109.41 of chronic pain.
3110.89 And it's an absolutely fascinating area
3113.14 of biology and neuroscience.
3114.69 And it's one that we can
actually all leverage
3117.26 toward reducing our own levels of pain
3120.06 whenever we are injured.
3121.41 Or believe it or not,
even in chronic pain.
3124.62 To describe this area of science requires
3126.73 a kind of extreme example,
3128.87 but I want to be clear that
even if you don't suffer
3131.42 from this extreme example,
3133.57 there's relevance and a
tool to extract for you.
3137.21 The extreme example is
that of an amputated digit,
3140.91 meaning one of your fingers or your toes,
3143.74 or of an amputated limb.
3146.03 So people that have digits or
limbs that are gone missing
3151.62 from an injury or surgical removal,
3154.83 will often have the experience
that it's still there.
3157.83 The so-called phantom limb phenomenon.
3161.14 Now, why would that be?
3162.75 Well, when you remove a
particular finger or limb,
3167.671 obviously that finger and limb is gone
3170.24 and the dorsal root ganglion neuron
3172.65 that would normally send a wire out
3174.98 to that particular region of the body,
3177.18 that wire is no longer
there because that portion
3179.56 of the body is no longer there.
3180.86 And in some cases, those neurons die
3183.54 almost always, but not always.
3185.87 However, the map your
so-called homunculus,
3188.65 your representation of yourself
in the brain is still there.
3194.28 And this map, the so-called homunculus map
3197.67 that you have in that
I have is very plastic.
3200.54 It can change.
3201.63 And so as a consequence areas of the map
3204.89 that adjacent to one another
3206.72 can actually start to invade
other areas of the map.
3211.34 So for instance, there
are neuroimaging studies
3214.89 that have documented that somebody
3216.66 that has say a complete
removal of their left arm,
3220.84 the representation of
their left arm still exists
3224.24 in the cortex.
3225.9 And experimentally if one is to stimulate
3228.99 that area of the cortex, that person,
3232.21 and if that person were you,
3233.66 would experience having that arm
3235.93 that it were being stimulated,
even though it's not there.
3239.1 Now, someone who has an
amputated arm doesn't need
3241.52 to have their brain stimulated
3243.33 in order to have the experience
3245.0 of that phantom limb being present.
3246.96 In fact, many people who have
limbs that were amputated
3250.87 feel as if that limb is still present
3253.65 even though obviously it's not.
3255.54 And no matter how many
times they look to the stump
3258.15 and just see a stump,
somehow it doesn't reorganize
3261.86 that homunculus so-called
central brain map.
3265.96 Now, that would be fine.
3268.6 You might even think that would be better,
3269.92 better to think you have the arm there
3271.94 than to feel as if it's missing,
3274.11 and yet many people who
have amputated limbs
3276.38 report phantom limb pain.
3279.22 They don't feel that the arm
3280.45 is just casually draped next to them.
3282.54 They feel as if it's bunched
up and it's an extreme pain.
3285.59 In fact, this kind of contorted stance
3289.5 that I'm taking right here in my chair
3290.98 is not unlike the way that
these patients described this.
3293.27 They feel as if it's kind of cramped up,
3295.28 it's very uncomfortable for them.
3297.66 Now, and absolutely creative
3301.41 and you could even say genius scientists
3304.33 by the name of Ramachandra.
3305.83 That's actually his last name,
3307.7 his complete name is a
little bit more complicated.
3309.97 So you all almost always hear
Ramachandran referred to as
3313.45 Ramachandran or V.S Ramachandran
because his full name
3316.8 is Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran.
3320.87 So a lot of letters in
there, a lot of vowels,
3323.36 but Ramachandran is a neuroscientist.
3326.99 He was actually a colleague of mine
3328.35 when my lab was formerly
3329.91 at the University of
California, San Diego.
3332.06 Has done a lot of work on
this phantom limb phenomenon.
3334.77 And Ramachandra actually started
off as a vision scientist.
3337.49 And he understood the
power of the visual system
3340.62 in dictating our experience
3342.81 of things like pain and pleasure.
3344.52 And so what he developed
was a very low technology
3348.49 yet neuroscientifically
sophisticated treatment
3352.06 for phantom limb.
3353.85 It consisted of a box, literally a box
3357.27 that had mirrors inside of it.
3359.46 And the patient would put
the intact hand or limb
3363.35 into one side,
3365.04 and obviously they couldn't
put the amputated limb
3367.34 into the other side, but
because of the configuration
3369.37 of the mirrors, it
appeared as though they had
3372.1 two symmetric limbs inside the box.
3375.48 And then he would have
them look at that limb
3378.44 and move it around.
3380.26 And as they would do this,
3381.64 they would report real time movement,
3385.11 or I should say real time
perception of movement
3387.51 in the phantom limb.
3389.14 Now this is absolutely
incredible but makes total sense
3391.75 when you think about
the so-called top down
3394.01 or contextual modulation
of our sensory experience,
3397.47 remember it's anticipation, it's anxiety,
3399.99 it's interpretation of what's happening
3402.27 that drives our perception
of what's happening.
3405.4 And so, as he would have these patients
3408.7 move their intact limb to
a more relaxed position,
3412.2 the patients would feel
3413.18 as if the phantom limb were relaxing.
3416.19 And this was used successfully
to treat phantom limb pain
3419.16 in a number of different people.
3421.04 It didn't always work.
3422.24 And you can imagine sometimes
3423.27 it might be a little
trickier like for a leg
3425.01 although there have been leg
boxes that have been developed
3429.47 and arranged for this purpose.
3431.51 And what was remarkable
is that they could finish
3433.83 these experiments and have
the patient, the person
3437.67 enter a state of relaxation,
3439.52 reduced the pain in the phantom limb,
3441.26 and it would stay there
even though, of course,
3443.22 as they exited the mirror box,
3446.01 they would go about their
life and use their intact limb
3448.41 for its various purposes.
3450.64 I love this experiment
because it really speaks
3452.68 to the subjective nature
of pain and pleasure.
3455.51 It speaks to the power
of the visual system,
3457.53 like what we see just like the nail
3459.3 through the boot experiment.
3460.27 What we see profoundly
impacts our experience
3464.37 of pleasure and pain in this case pain.
3467.15 Now, there's another aspect
to the phantom limb experience
3472.07 and of these maps, the
so-called homunculus maps
3474.79 in the cortex that Ramachandran worked on,
3477.87 which has very interesting
and reveals the degree
3481.06 to which these maps are
plastic or can change
3483.88 in response to experience.
3486.45 Turns out that because of the locations
3490.57 of different body part
representations within these maps,
3494.91 certain parts of our body that
normally we don't think of
3497.92 as related can start to
create merged experiences.
3503.04 What do I mean by that?
3504.26 Well, Ramchandran described a patient
3507.44 who had a somewhat odd experience
of having lost their foot.
3513.18 So they actually had their foot amputated
3515.8 about midway up the Achilles.
3517.39 So lower portion of the calf and foot.
3521.12 I don't recall what the reason
was for having it removed.
3524.27 And fortunately for this patient,
3526.01 they did not experience pain
in that portion of their body,
3530.27 but rather they confided in him
3533.28 that whenever they would have sex,
3536.82 they would experience their
orgasm in their phantom foot
3541.2 in addition to in their
genitals, of course.
3543.83 And Ramachandra understood
the homunculus map.
3547.38 And he understood that this
was because the representation
3550.73 of the foot within the homunculus
actually lies adjacent to,
3554.77 and is somewhat interdigitated with
3557.19 it actually kind of merges
with the representation
3561.01 of the genitalia.
3562.88 Now that's a weird situation.
3566.49 And yet you now know that
the density of innovation
3570.94 of the feet and the genitalia,
3572.71 as well as the lips and
the face are actually
3574.407 the highest sensory innervation
3577.89 that you have in your entire body.
3579.66 And this speaks to, I think,
3581.55 a more important general
principle for all people
3584.43 of the experience of pleasure or pain,
3586.84 which is that an aspect
of our pain or pleasure
3590.21 can be highly localized.
3592.72 It can be because of a cut
to a particular location
3594.87 on the body or it can
because of a fall injury
3601.35 or a kind of bruise on
one side of our body.
3604.13 And yet our experience
of pleasure and pain
3606.97 can also be an almost
a body-wide experience.
3611.19 And yet it's always most rich.
3613.83 It's always most heightened
in these regions of our body
3616.43 that have dense sensory innervation.
3619.18 So we experience pain
and pleasure according
3621.28 to local phenomenon receptors in the skin,
3623.8 and this homunculus map
3625.01 that has all these different territories,
3627.0 but because of the way that
those territories are related,
3629.94 this kind of wild example of
somebody experiencing orgasm
3633.46 in their phantom foot speaks
to the larger experience.
3636.65 The more typical rather
experience that I should say
3639.57 that all people have,
3641.16 which is that pleasure can be body-wide
3644.15 or we can experience it in our face
3646.29 or the bottoms of our feet
and other areas of the body
3649.13 that we experience pleasure
and similarly with pain.
3652.12 And that brings us to the
topic of whole body pain,
3655.25 not just localized pain, as
well as whole body pleasure
3659.06 not just localized pleasure.
3661.46 There are a number of
examples of whole body pain
3665.2 that people suffer from.
3666.39 And one common one is called fibromyalgia.
3670.385 I want to just first share
with you a little bit
3672.69 of medical insight.
3674.41 A few months back, I did an Instagram live
3677.04 with Dr. Sean Mackey
who's an MD medical doctor
3680.97 and a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine
3683.71 that was recorded and
placed on my Instagram.
3686.22 If you want to check it out,
3687.46 we can provide a link to
that in the show notes.
3690.18 Dr. Mackey is the Chief
of the Division of Pain
3694.1 at Stanford School of Medicine.
3695.93 So he's a scientist.
3697.07 He studies pain and he
treats patients dealing
3700.07 with various forms of
pain, whole body pain,
3702.1 like fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera.
3705.23 And he shared with me
something very interesting,
3707.17 which is that anytime you
hear or see the word syndrome,
3712.162 that means the medical
establishment does not understand
3715.74 what's going on.
3716.59 A syndrome is a constellation of symptoms
3720.03 that point in a particular direction
3722.22 or some general set of directions about
3724.05 what could be going on,
3725.53 but it doesn't reveal a true
underlying disease necessarily.
3730.58 It could be aggregative diseases
3732.89 or it could be something else entirely.
3735.36 And I want to make sure that I emphasize
3738.7 the so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.
3741.4 I think sometimes we hear psychosomatic
3743.59 and we interpret that as
meaning all in one's head.
3746.62 But I think it's important to remember
3748.41 that everything is neural,
3749.6 whether that's pain in your body
3751.41 'cause you have a gaping wound
3753.67 and you're hemorrhaging out of that wound
3755.62 or whether or not it's pain
for which you cannot explain it
3760.15 on the basis of any kind of injury.
3761.64 It's all neural.
3762.68 So saying body, brain, or psychosomatic
3766.033 it's kind of irrelevant.
3767.36 And I hope someday we
move past that language.
3771.12 Psychosomatic is interesting.
3774.76 There was a paper that
was published in 2015,
3777.22 and then again in 2020 a different paper
3780.52 focused on the so-called
psychogenic fevers
3783.81 or psychosomatic effects.
3785.03 I just briefly want to mention this
3786.42 because it relates back to pain.
3789.96 These studies have shown
that there are areas
3791.79 of the so-called thalamus,
3793.05 which integrates and
filter sensory information
3795.77 of different kinds.
3797.25 And within the brainstem,
an area called the DMH
3801.343 and I can also provide a link
to this study if you like,
3804.06 that shows that there is
a true neurological basis.
3808.11 There are brain areas and
circuits that are related to
3811.11 what's called psychogenic
fever when we are stressed.
3814.43 And in particular, if we
think that we were injured
3817.62 or that we were infected by something,
3819.82 we can actually generate a true fever.
3823.09 It is not an imagined fever.
3825.24 It is our thinking generating
3828.32 an increase in body temperature.
3830.51 And so this has been called psychosomatic.
3832.63 It's been called psychogenic,
but it has a neural basis.
3836.79 So when we hear syndrome and
a patient comes into a clinic
3841.46 and says that they suffer for instance,
3843.69 from something which is
very controversial frankly
3846.15 like chronic fatigue syndrome,
3847.75 some physicians believe that it reflects
3850.05 a real underlying medical
condition, others don't.
3853.438 However, syndrome means
we don't understand.
3858.22 And that doesn't mean
something doesn't exist.
3861.29 Fibromyalgia or whole
body pain for a long time
3865.32 was written off or kind of explained away
3868.63 by physicians and scientists
frankly, my community
3872.29 as one of these syndromes.
3874.37 It couldn't be explained.
3875.52 However, now there is
what I would consider
3878.76 and I think others would
and should consider
3881.88 from understanding of at
least one of the bases
3885.11 for this whole body pain.
3886.92 And that's activation of
a particular cell type
3890.24 called glial.
3891.88 And there's a receptor on these glial
3893.78 for those of you that want to
know called the toll 4 receptor
3897.1 and activation of the
toll 4 receptor is related
3901.0 to certain forms of whole
body pain and fibromyalgia.
3904.97 Now, what treatments
exist for fibromyalgia.
3908.47 And even if you don't
suffer from fibromyalgia,
3910.29 and even if you don't know anyone who does
3913.2 this is important information
3914.48 because what I'm about to tell you relate
3916.29 to how you and your body,
which is you of course
3920.8 can deal with pain of any kind.
3923.1 And there are actually things
that one can do and take
3926.56 that can encourage
nerve health in general.
3929.56 In other conditions like
diabetic neuropathy,
3931.77 but in all individuals.
3934.14 So there are clinical data
using a prescription drug.
3940.29 This is work that actually was done
3941.57 by Dr. Mackey and colleagues.
3943.94 The drug is called naltrexone.
3944.89 Naltrexone is actually
used for the treatment
3947.52 of various opioid addictions
and things of that sort,
3951.78 but it turns out that a very low dose,
3954.08 I believe it was a one 10th
the size of the typical dose
3958.81 of naltrexone has been
shown to have some success
3963.415 in dealing with and treating
certain forms of fibromyalgia.
3966.65 And it has that success
because of its ability
3969.52 to bind to and block these
toll four receptors on glial.
3974.36 So this so-called syndrome
or this thing that previously
3977.25 was called a syndrome, fibromyalgia
3979.12 actually has a biological basis.
3981.23 It was not just inpatients heads.
3983.66 And I really tip my hat to
the medical establishment
3986.63 including Dr. Mackey and others
3988.47 who explored the potential
underlying biologies
3992.07 of things like fibromyalgia
and are starting
3993.81 to arrive at treatments.
3995.03 Now, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor,
3997.07 so I'm not prescribing anything.
3998.59 You should talk to your doctor of course,
3999.97 if you have fibromyalgia
or other forms of chronic
4003.17 or whole body pain to explore
whether or not these low dose
4006.1 naltrexone treatments are right for you.
4008.86 But I think it's a beautiful
case study if you will,
4011.64 not a case study of an individual patient,
4013.34 but a case in study of linking
up the patient's self-report
4018.34 of these experiences and using science
4020.79 to try to establish clinical treatments.
4023.5 There's another treatment,
4025.28 or I should say there's another approach
4026.92 that one could take.
4027.753 And again, I'm not recommending
people do this necessarily.
4030.22 You have to determine what's
right and say for you,
4032.31 I cannot do that.
4033.51 There's no way your
situation's very far too much,
4035.79 and it would be outside of my wheelhouse
4038.3 to prescribe anything, but
there's a particular compound
4042.85 which in the United States
is sold over the counter
4045.19 and in Europe is prescription.
4046.73 It's one that I've talked
about on this podcast before
4048.97 for other purposes.
4050.11 And that compound is acetylcarnitine.
4054.309 Acetylcarnitine as I
mentioned is by prescription
4056.947 in most countries in Europe
4058.317 and the US you can buy
this over the counter.
4061.25 There is evidence that
acetylcarnitine can reduce
4064.98 the symptoms of chronic whole body pain
4066.93 and other certain forms of acute pain
4069.65 at dosages of somewhere
between one to three
4073.16 and sometimes four grams per day.
4075.48 Now acetylcarnitine can be taken orally.
4078.04 It's found in 500 milligram capsules,
4080.77 as well as by injection.
4083.29 By injection in the States
in the United States that is
4086.66 also requires a prescription
4088.35 or requires a prescription I should say.
4090.95 The over-the-counter forms
are generally capsules
4093.26 or powders.
4094.54 Those apparently do not
require a prescription.
4097.61 There are several studies
exploring acetylcarnitine
4100.5 in this context, as well
as for diabetic neuropathy.
4104.0 And what's interesting about
acetylcarnitine is it's one
4106.33 of the few compounds that isn't just used
4110.07 for the treatment of pain,
4111.65 but has also been shown
in certain contacts
4114.22 to improve peripheral
nerve health generally.
4117.8 And for that reason, it's
an interesting compound.
4120.51 I've also talked about
acetylcarnitine on here previously,
4123.68 because it has robust effects
on things like spur motility
4128.03 and health, including the
speeds at which sperms swim,
4132.96 how straight they swim
turns out that swimming
4135.62 for sperm is more efficient
if they swim straight,
4138.57 as opposed to like those
kids in on the swim team,
4142.45 they're like banging up
against the lane lines
4144.12 and zigzagging all over the place.
4146.23 So it does turn out to be the
case that the quickest route
4150.72 between any two places is a straight line
4152.619 and the good sperm know that,
4154.47 and the less good sperm
don't seem to know that.
4156.707 And acetylcarnitine seems to
facilitate straight swimming
4159.85 trajectories as well as speed of swimming
4161.64 and overall sperm health.
4163.17 And there is evidence from
quality peer reviewed studies
4166.8 showing that acetylcarnitine
supplementation can also be
4169.96 beneficial for women's fertility
in ways that it affects
4173.84 perhaps we don't really
know the mechanism,
4176.61 health and status of the
egg or egg implantation.
4179.8 There are a large number of
studies on acetylcarnitine.
4182.21 You can look those up
on Pub Med, if you like,
4184.7 or on examine.com.
4186.71 There are some studies that I don't think
4188.5 are included there which are
particularly interesting.
4190.41 One that I just would like
to reference the last name
4195.21 of the first author is
Mahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I.
4201.29 The title of the paper is
4202.58 Effects of l -Carnitine Supplementation
4204.82 on Serum Inflammatory Markers
4207.06 and Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes
4209.78 in Females with Knee Osteoarthritis.
4212.13 So this is a randomized double
blind placebo controlled
4214.63 pilot study that showed
really interesting effects
4217.362 of short term supplementation
of acetylcarnitine.
4221.45 Longer term, the effects
were less impressive.
4223.941 So it's pretty interesting
that this compound has
4226.36 so many different effects.
4227.24 How could it have these effects?
4228.37 Well, it appears that
it's having these effects
4230.41 through its impact on the
so-called inflammatory cytokines.
4235.07 Inflammatory cytokines for
those of you that don't know
4237.708 are secreted by the immune system
4239.76 in response to different stressors,
4242.08 physical stressors, mental stressors too
4244.71 food that you eat that isn't good for you.
4247.77 The so-called hidden sugars.
4249.21 Yes, will increase inflammation
4251.8 if they're ingested too often,
4253.15 or in amounts that are
too high in quantity.
4255.73 Things like Interleukin 1 beta,
4257.94 things like C-reactive protein,
4259.73 things like interleukin 6.
4261.23 Interleukin 6 is kind of the
generic inflammatory marker
4264.26 that all studies refer to.
4265.49 And yet there are other interleukins,
4267.49 please note that there
are other interleukins
4269.92 like interleukin 10 that
are anti-inflammatory.
4273.72 So immune system can secrete
inflammatory molecules
4276.52 to deal with wounds and stress and things.
4278.73 And in the short term that's good,
4279.96 and in the longterm that's bad.
4281.65 And it can secrete anti-inflammatory
cytokines like IL10.
4287.37 And these matrix metalloproteinases,
4289.49 it's kind of a mouthful,
4290.7 but these matrix metalloproteinases
are very interesting.
4293.03 Anytime you see A-S-E, ASE
that's generally an enzyme,
4297.4 which means that these
compounds in this case,
4300.88 these matrix metalloproteinases are used
4302.93 to break down certain
elements around wounds
4306.994 and scoring which might
sound like a bad thing,
4309.82 but in some cases is good
because it allows certain cells
4313.17 like glial cells so-called microglia
4315.13 to come in like low ambulances,
4316.56 like low paramedics and clean up wounds.
4319.4 So scarring and inflammation
4320.95 is kind of a double-edged sword.
4322.64 It can be good, but too much scarring.
4325.13 If it contains a wound too much,
4326.87 doesn't allow the
infiltration of cell types
4329.03 to move in and take care of
that wound and heal it up.
4331.75 So it appears that L-carnitine
is impacting a number
4334.259 of different processes,
both to impact pain
4337.08 and perhaps, and I want
to underscore perhaps,
4339.21 but there are good studies happening now,
4342.15 perhaps accelerate wound healing as well.
4345.66 As long as we're talking about acute pain
4347.277 and chronic pain and supplementation
4349.35 and non-prescription drugs,
at least in the United States
4352.06 that people can take to deal
with pain of various kinds,
4354.98 I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two
4356.92 that I get asked most often about,
4359.01 which are agmatine and
S-adenosyl-L-methionine,
4364.207 which is sometimes called SAMe.
4367.01 Both of those have been
shown to have some impact
4371.42 categorized on examine as notable impact
4374.52 on various forms of pain,
due to osteoarthritis,
4378.19 or due to injury of various
kinds of indifferent subject
4381.83 population, men, women, people
of different ages, et cetera.
4385.35 SAMe in particular has been interesting
4387.7 because it's been shown head to head
4390.12 with drugs like Naproxen and
other drugs of that sort,
4394.35 which are well established
and sold over the counter
4397.85 in the US to work at least as well
4401.01 as some of those compounds
at certain doses.
4404.03 But it's also shown that SAMe
4406.847 and some of those things take more time
4409.26 in order to have those effects.
4411.54 In fact, head to head
with things like Neproxin
4414.283 have been shown that they
can take up to a month
4417.09 in order to have the
pain relieving effect.
4419.3 Now, whether or not that
makes them a better choice
4420.99 or a worst choice really
depends on your circumstances.
4423.64 I'm certainly not recommending
that anybody take anything,
4426.34 but I do think it's interesting
and important to point out
4428.93 that things like
agmatine, things like SAMe
4431.4 have been shown under
certain circumstances
4433.629 to be beneficial for pain and
they are outside the realm
4437.02 of prescription drugs.
4438.03 I think this is a growing area of
4440.26 some people call them supplements,
4441.34 some people call them nutraceuticals.
4443.51 Look, at the end of the
day these are compounds
4445.41 that affect cellular processes.
4446.96 And the more that we understand
4447.93 how they affect those cellar processes
4449.658 as we now do for things
like acetylcarnitine,
4453.11 I think the more trust
that we can put into them,
4455.46 or the more to which we
might want to avoid them
4459.14 because of some of the side effects
4460.75 or contra-indications that
those compounds could have.
4463.36 If you're interested in
those other compounds,
4465.408 I do invite you as I always
do to check out examine.com,
4468.81 but also to do your
research on those compounds
4471.098 by simply putting them into Google
4473.06 or putting them into PubMed,
which would be even better.
4475.39 And if you are going to go into PubMed,
4477.22 if you're going to
start playing scientist,
4479.16 which I do encourage you to do,
4480.958 I would encourage you to
not just read abstracts,
4483.63 but if you can, if the
studies are freely available,
4485.86 I realized not all of
them are freely available
4488.08 to try and read those studies
4489.26 at least to the extent that you can.
4491.71 There's a particularly nice
study that you might look at
4494.05 that was published in
2010 in Pain Medicine,
4497.46 which is Keynan et al K-E-Y-N-A-N,
4501.47 which looked at the safety and efficacy
4503.34 of dietary agmatine sulfate
4505.51 on lumbar disc associated radiculopathy
4511.66 not laughing at the condition.
4512.91 It's a painful condition that describes a,
4516.9 it's a kind of a range
of symptoms that relate
4518.91 to pinching of nerves.
4520.18 The spinal columns,
4521.013 I was laughing at my pronunciation of it.
4523.15 That particular study is quite good.
4525.57 And the conclusion of that
study that they drew was that
4529.61 there were limited side effects
4531.56 and that dietary agmatine sulfate is safe
4534.24 and efficacious for treating
and alleviating pain
4536.67 and improving quality of life
4538.47 and lumbar-disc associated pain.
4540.89 However, there were very
specific dosage regimens
4545.99 that were described there
and duration of treatment.
4548.25 And so you should not take
anything that I say or that study
4551.25 to mean that you can just
take this stuff willy-nilly
4553.06 or at any concentration
of course, or dose.
4556.03 You always want to pay attention
to what the science says.
4559.31 That paper fortunately is
freely available online.
4562.04 And we will also provide
a link to that study.
4564.27 For those of you that
are interested in SAMe
4566.14 and its usage for the treatment
of various types of pain,
4570.17 and perhaps other benefits,
4572.72 a number of companies
have stopped making SAMe
4576.017 instead what they're now
focusing on is what they think
4578.93 is a better or more
bioavailable alternative,
4582.265 which is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
or 5-MTHF.
4590.17 This molecule is necessary
for converting homocysteine
4593.55 to methionine, which is
then converted to SAMe
4597.32 so rather than taking SAMe directly,
4600.6 the idea is to take
something that's upstream
4602.58 of SAMe and make more SAMe
endogenously available.
4606.57 This is a different strategy.
4608.01 I've talked about this strategy before
4609.88 for increasing other things
like growth hormone, et cetera.
4613.27 There's always this
question of whether or not
4615.43 in trying to increase the
amount of a particular molecule
4618.07 in the body, whether or not
taking that specific molecule
4620.257 was the best thing or
working further upstream
4623.63 as it's referred to
working on the precursor
4627.26 or increasing the levels of the precursor
4629.07 is the better way to go.
4630.99 It appears that this
5-MTHF is the strategy
4636.16 that people are now taking in
place of taking SAMe directly.
4641.22 So in other words, they're taking this
4642.39 in order to get elevated levels of SAMe.
4645.43 Now, I'd like to turn our attention
4646.84 to a completely non drug, non
supplement related approach
4651.57 to dealing with pain.
4652.96 And it's one that has existed
for thousands of years.
4656.96 And that only recently has the
Western scientific community
4660.864 started to pay serious attention to,
4663.82 but they have started to
pay serious attention to it.
4666.85 And there is terrific mechanistic
science to now explain
4671.68 how and why acupuncture can work very well
4675.6 for the treatment of
certain forms of pain.
4678.09 Now, first off, I want to
tell you what was told to me
4681.59 by our director or Chief
of the Pain Division
4684.49 at Stanford School of
Medicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,
4687.01 which was that some
people respond very well
4690.24 to acupuncture and others do not.
4693.246 And the challenge is
identifying who'll respond well
4697.47 and who won't respond well.
4699.76 Now, when I say won't respond well,
4701.28 that doesn't necessarily
mean that they responded
4703.438 in a negative way, that
it was bad for them,
4706.5 but it does appear that
a fraction of people
4709.89 experienced tremendous pain
relief from acupuncture
4713.02 and others experience
none at all or very little
4715.9 to the point where they have to seek out
4717.41 other forms of treatment.
4719.83 The science on this is still ongoing.
4722.67 There was actually an excellent
paper published on this
4724.64 in the Journal of the
American Medical Association,
4727.05 one of the premier
medical clinical journals.
4730.62 And it basically reinforced the idea
4732.78 that you have responders
and non-responders.
4735.629 A number of laboratories
have started to explore
4739.04 how acupuncture works.
4741.25 And one of the premier
laboratories for this
4743.75 is Qiufu Ma's lab at
Harvard Medical School.
4747.624 Qiufu has spent many years
studying the pain system
4751.48 and a system that's
related to the pain system,
4753.95 which is the system that
controls our sensation of itch.
4758.86 Just as a brief aside about itch,
4761.23 itch and pain are often co
associated with one another.
4765.47 I was recently in Texas,
and I will tell you,
4767.65 they have some mean mosquitoes.
4770.0 They're small, but
whatever they're injecting
4772.59 into your skin.
4773.55 Well, here I am talking now
about my subjective experience
4775.74 of pain, whatever they
injected into my skin
4778.03 felt to me like the most
extreme mosquito bites
4782.23 I've ever had, not while
they were biting me,
4784.83 not while they were
injecting the venom, but boy,
4787.39 those Texas mosquitoes make me itch.
4790.271 How do they do it?
4791.4 Well, their venom creates little packets
4795.54 of so-called histamine that travel around
4798.43 those packets are called mast cells,
4801.07 little packets of histamine
that go to that location
4803.4 and make me and presumably you
4805.64 want to scratch those mosquito bites.
4807.86 I scratch mine you scratch yours,
4809.08 but we both scratch our mosquito bites.
4811.05 And when we do that, the
histamines are released.
4813.14 That gets red and inflamed
and the itch even worse.
4816.51 The inflammation is actually
caused by the histamine.
4819.23 Well, that experience of
inflammation and pain and itch
4825.81 is what we call a pyrogenic experience.
4826.643 So we we have pain which is
nociception, essentially,
4829.91 I know that the pain of aficionado
4834.672 always get a little upset
because they say, oh,
4836.83 there's no such thing
as as a pain receptor,
4838.73 it's no susceptive receptors
4840.16 and pain is subjective experience.
4841.79 Yes, I acknowledge all that.
4843.51 But for fluency, let's
just think about pain
4846.47 as a certain experience and
itch as a separate experience,
4849.1 but they often exist together
because those mosquito bites
4852.36 were what I would call painful,
or at least not pleasant.
4855.94 They didn't just itch,
they were also painful nuts
4858.77 because itch brings with it inflammation
4861.78 and inflammation often
brings with it pain relief,
4864.8 but it can also bring with
it the sensation of pain.
4867.69 So itch and pain are
two separate phenomenon.
4870.66 It was actually discovered
through a really interesting
4873.86 phenomenon that relates to something
4875.49 that is actually consumed
in supplement form,
4878.29 which is this tropical legume.
4880.49 It's actually a bean
called Mucuna pruriens.
4883.69 That's M-U-C-U-N-A that's
one word P-R-U-I-E-N-S
4889.36 Mucuna pruriens is a bean,
it's as legume that this bean
4894.73 is 99% L-DOPA.
4897.31 It's dopamine or rather it's
the precursor to dopamine
4900.06 and people buy this stuff
and take it over the counter
4902.47 as ways to increase
their levels of dopamine.
4904.68 It does make you feel
really dopamine doubt,
4907.86 meaning it makes you feel a
little high and really motivated
4910.8 and really energetic
a lot like other drugs
4913.69 that will do that.
4915.13 I don't necessarily recommend
taking Mucuna pruriens.
4917.81 I personally don't like taking it.
4920.03 Doesn't make me feel good.
4921.16 I crash really hard when I take it.
4923.89 But on the outside of
this bean is a compound
4927.88 that makes people itch.
4930.52 So they remove this when you
take it in supplement form.
4932.65 In fact, it's usually in capsule form,
4934.58 but the outside of this
bean, it's like a hairy bean.
4938.08 And those little hairs contain a compound,
4941.056 which was actually used
to study and identify
4944.84 these itchy receptors in the skin.
4947.11 So we don't have time to go
into all the details of itch,
4950.06 but it's pretty interesting
that you have these compounds
4952.42 out in nature that can make us itch.
4954.03 Inside them they have dopamine.
4955.56 I mean, this is really weird,
4956.54 but plant compounds are really powerful.
4958.9 So don't let anyone tell
you that because something's
4961.64 from a plant or an earth
that it's not powerful.
4964.052 There are very powerful
plant and herb compounds.
4967.5 Mucuna prurien being one of
them with dopamine on the inside
4970.22 and itchy stuff on the outside.
4972.31 Now, what does this all
have to do with acupuncture?
4974.61 Well, Qiufu Ma's lab
has not just identified
4978.75 the itch pathway, this pruritus
genes as they're called,
4981.95 which causes itch and
the pyrogenic phenomenon
4984.94 of itch being separate from pain.
4987.23 His lab has also studied how
acupuncture causes relief of,
4992.76 but also can exacerbate pain.
4996.1 Now, the form of acupuncture
that they explored
4998.08 was one that's commonly in
use called electroacupuncture.
5000.71 So this isn't just putting little needles
5003.1 into different parts of the body.
5005.0 These needles are able to
pass an electrical current,
5008.73 not magically, but because they have
5009.97 a little wire going back to a device
5011.36 and you can pass electrical current.
5012.76 Here's what they found.
5014.053 This is a study published
in the journal neuron
5017.45 Cell Press journal, excellent
journal, very high stringency.
5020.5 So what Qiufu Ma's lab found
was that if electroacupuncture
5025.0 is provided to the abdomen,
to the stomach area,
5029.24 it creates activation of what are called
5032.17 the sympathetic ganglia.
5033.41 These have nothing to do with sympathy
5035.07 in the emotional sense has to
do with the stress response.
5038.35 Sympa just means together.
5039.63 So it activated a bunch of
neurons along the spinal cord.
5043.68 And the activation of
these neurons evolves
5046.78 neural adrenaline and something
called NPY neuropeptide Y.
5053.0 The long and short of it is
that stimulating the abdomen
5055.63 with electroacupuncture was
either anti-inflammatory
5060.73 or it could cause inflammation.
5062.65 It could actually exacerbate
inflammation depending
5065.2 on whether or not it was
of low or high intensity.
5068.81 Now that makes it a very
precarious technique.
5071.02 And this may speak to some of the reason
5073.36 why some people report
relief from acupuncture
5076.32 and others do not.
5077.78 However, they went a step further
and stimulated other areas
5081.55 of the body using electroacupuncture.
5083.472 And what they found is that
stimulation of the legs
5086.1 of the hind limbs, as
it's called an animals,
5087.93 and the legs in humans caused a circuit,
5091.38 a neural circuit to be activated that goes
5093.45 from the legs up to an area
of the base of the brain
5097.92 called the DMV not the DMH,
which I mentioned earlier,
5101.31 but the DMV like you go to the DMV,
5104.35 which is a miserable experience
for most people, forgive me,
5106.82 DMV employees, but let's be honest
5109.32 most people don't enjoy
going to the DMV as patrons,
5113.16 but we have to so we go.
5115.04 The DMV and low intensity stimulation,
5119.45 this electroacupuncture of the
hind limbs activated the DMV
5123.92 and activated the adrenal glands,
5125.83 which sit at top of your
kidneys and cause the release
5130.1 of what are called catecholamines.
5131.81 And those were strongly anti-inflammatory.
5135.34 In other words, electroacupuncture
of the legs and feet can,
5140.36 if done correctly, be anti-inflammatory
5143.1 and reduce symptoms of pain.
5145.14 And can we think accelerate wound healing
5148.43 because activations of these
catecholaminergic pathways
5151.9 can accelerate wound healing as well.
5154.14 So the takeaway from this is
that while there are thousands
5158.35 of years and millions of
subjects involved in explorations
5162.86 of electroacupuncture and acupuncture,
5166.37 Western medicine is
starting to come into this
5169.03 and start to explore underlying mechanism.
5171.08 Now, for those of you
that love acupuncture
5173.72 and are real proponents of it,
5176.3 it's worked for you, you might say,
5177.64 well, why does Western medicine
even need to come into this?
5180.33 Why should they even be exploring this?
5182.37 But we should all be
relieved that they are
5184.4 because what's starting to happen now
5186.88 is that as the mechanistic basis for this
5189.54 is starting to come to light,
5192.57 insurance coverage of
things like acupuncture
5195.99 is starting to emerge as well.
5198.15 And this is in contrast to other therapies
5200.38 for which there's a lot
of anecdotal evidence,
5203.0 but very little mechanistic understanding.
5205.18 One example of that would
be laser photo biomodulation
5208.407 the use of lasers of
different types really
5212.41 to treat pain and to
accelerate wound healing.
5214.68 A lot of people claim that
this can really help them.
5217.59 However, most places,
at least in the States,
5220.129 won't cover this with insurance
5221.8 or don't perform this in standard clinics.
5224.184 And the reason is the underlying
mechanism isn't known.
5228.31 I'm not going to get into the
argument about whether or not
5230.9 mechanistic understanding
should or should not be required
5234.66 in order to have insurance
coverage of things that work.
5237.8 That's not what this is about.
5239.11 And that actually will
be a boring discussion
5241.35 because I'm shouting at
a tunnel through you.
5243.67 And I wouldn't be able
to hear you shout back
5245.33 no matter what your stance on that is,
5247.22 but just trust me when I
say that I am both relieved
5250.938 and delighted to hear that
excellent medical institutions
5255.04 like Stanford are starting to
think about electroacupuncture
5259.033 and how it can work.
5259.866 That places like Harvard
Medical School are starting
5262.21 to explore this at a mechanistic level.
5264.32 And I do believe that
there's an open-mindedness
5266.84 that starting to emerge for instance,
5269.402 the National Institutes of Health,
5272.0 not only has an institute
for mental health
5274.09 and cancer research and an eye institute,
5275.76 but now complementary
health, the so-called NCCIH.
5279.7 National Institutes of
Complementary Health
5281.97 that is exploring things
like electroacupuncture,
5284.66 meditation, various supplements
and things of those sort.
5288.08 I do think that we're entering
a new realm in which things
5290.19 like pain and pain management
will be met with more openness
5293.8 by all physicians, at
least that's my hope.
5295.97 So please take that into
consideration right now.
5298.829 The mechanistic evidence
for laser photobiomodulation
5302.27 is not strong.
5303.19 One of the major issues
or the barriers to that
5307.33 is that most of the
studies that are out there
5310.235 were actually paid for by companies
5313.03 that build devices for
laser photobiomodulation.
5318.18 And so we really need
independent studies funded
5320.8 by federal institutions that have no bias
5323.26 or financial relationship
in order to gain trust
5326.9 in whatever data happen to emerge.
5329.97 There is a technique that at one time
5331.65 was considered alternative,
5333.07 but now has a lot of mechanistic science
5335.88 to explain how it works,
and it does indeed work
5339.23 for the treatment of chronic
and also for acute pain.
5343.543 And that treatment is hypnosis
in particular self-hypnosis.
5348.55 Now, my colleague at Stanford
in fact, my collaborator,
5352.17 Dr. David Spiegel, our
Associate Chair of Psychiatry
5354.95 has devoted his professional life
5356.67 to developing hypnosis
tools that people can use
5360.3 to help them sleep better, focus better,
5362.5 stay motivated, et cetera.
5364.73 While most people hear
hypnosis and they think,
5366.68 oh, this is stage hypnosis.
5368.09 People walking around like chickens
5369.48 are being forced to laugh
5370.69 or fall asleep on command, et cetera.
5373.1 This is completely
different than all that.
5374.62 This is self hypnosis
and there are now dozens,
5377.91 if not more quality peer
reviewed studies published
5381.69 in excellent journals done by Dr. Spiegel
5384.98 and others at other universities.
5387.57 It really all has to do
with how self-hypnosis
5390.64 can modulate activity
of the prefrontal cortex
5394.6 and related structures like the insula.
5397.23 The prefrontal cortex is involved
in our executive function
5402.32 as it's called, our planning,
our decision making,
5404.32 but also how we interpret context,
5407.2 what the meaning of a given sensation is.
5410.15 And that's extremely powerful.
5411.727 I just want to remind
everybody that the currency
5415.0 of the brain and body has not changed
5417.01 in hundreds of thousands of years.
5418.69 It's always been dopamine,
serotonin, glutamate,
5421.01 GABA, testosterone, estrogen.
5423.35 What's changed are the contingencies,
5425.6 the events in the world
that drive whether or not
5428.05 we get an increase or decrease
in testosterone or estrogen,
5431.11 the events in the world
that dictate whether or not
5433.44 we get an increase or
a decrease in dopamine.
5436.05 Believe me, the events
that drove those increases
5438.76 and decreases were very
different even a 100 years ago
5441.09 than they are now.
5442.47 And as we create new things and
societies change, et cetera,
5445.91 they will continue to exchange information
5450.43 in the same currency, which
is dopamine, serotonin,
5453.01 and all these other
neuromodulators and chemicals.
5455.45 Hypnosis takes advantage of this
5457.629 by allowing an individual,
you, if you like
5462.04 to change the way that you
interpret particular events
5464.61 and to actually experience
what would be painful
5466.99 as less painful or not painful.
5469.18 And that's just the example of pain.
5470.54 Hypnosis is powerful
for other reasons too.
5472.9 It actually can help
rewire neural circuits
5475.68 so that you don't experience as much pain
5478.16 so that you can sleep
faster, focus faster.
5480.21 If this is all sounding very fantastical
5483.52 well, it's supported by data.
5487.0 The data are that when
people do self-hypnosis
5490.07 even brief self-hypnosis
of 10 or 15 minutes,
5493.26 a few times a week, maybe
even returned to that hypnosis
5496.67 by just using a one minute a day hypnosis,
5499.37 they can achieve significant
and often very impressive
5503.38 degrees of pain relief in chronic pain
5506.21 whether or not that chronic pain arises
5507.76 through things like fibromyalgia
or through other sources.
5510.66 If you want to check this out,
5512.15 there's a wonderful zero cost resource
5514.19 that's grounded in this work.
5516.24 It's the app reveri.com.
5519.78 So R-E-V-E-R-I.com.
5523.198 There you can download a zero cost app
5527.02 for Apple phones or for Android phones.
5530.34 And there are a variety of
different hypnosis scripts.
5532.68 These are actually self hypnosis scripts,
5534.28 and you'll actually hear Dr.
David Spiegel talking to you.
5537.17 He can teach you about
hypnosis and how it works.
5539.68 There are links to scientific studies
5541.468 that web address that I
gave you before reveri.com.
5544.93 You can see the various studies
and the various write-ups
5547.29 related to those studies
and how this all works.
5549.56 And they're simple protocols.
5550.926 You just click on a tab and
you listen to the self-hypnosis
5553.79 and it will take you into hypnosis.
5556.18 And several of those hypnosis
grips have been shown
5559.37 clinically to relieve certain
patterns of chronic pain.
5564.24 So it's a powerful tool,
and I encourage you not
5566.63 to write off the non-drug
non supplement tools
5570.01 as less than powerful
because indeed many people
5573.27 experience tremendous relief from them.
5575.29 And of course, they also can be combined
5577.85 with drug treatments
if that's right for you
5580.17 or with supplements and things
of that sort to treat pain,
5583.24 if that's right for you.
5584.72 So again, electroacupuncture
now often supported
5588.89 by insurance, not always, but often.
5591.22 Great mechanistic data starting to emerge.
5593.89 Hypnosis, terrific tool.
5597.32 There's even the self-hypnosis
tool that one can access
5599.97 through the zero cost app Reveri
5601.98 and lots of great clinical data
5604.96 and scientific mechanistic data.
5606.68 There are neuro imaging studies showing
5608.16 that different brain areas
are activated in hypnosis
5610.237 the so-called default network,
5612.37 kind of where your brains is kind of idols
5615.21 and the different circuits
that are active in at rest
5618.02 shift with hypnosis and shift long-term
5620.25 in ways that positively conserve you.
5622.38 And then these things like
laser photobiomodulation
5625.24 still more or less in that
experimental medical community.
5628.71 I should say, Western Medical
Community, not so certain,
5631.38 but hopefully there will be data soon,
5633.57 and hopefully those data
will point to mechanisms
5635.96 that allow the insurance companies
5638.41 and other sort of medical
bodies to support them
5643.35 if indeed they have a mechanistic basis.
5646.09 I just want to briefly touch on
a common method of pain relief
5649.43 that speaks to a more general principle
5652.18 of how things like electroacupuncture,
5654.44 and also some of these
new emerging techniques
5657.16 of kind of like active tissue release
5660.02 and this principle that
you hear a lot about
5661.87 in sports medicine now that
when you have pain or injury
5664.21 at one site, that you
should provide pressure
5666.68 above and below that site.
5668.03 You may have seen this in the
Olympics, which is ongoing now
5671.81 where people will put tape on their body
5674.72 at certain locations oftentimes.
5676.509 The logic or what they're
saying is that this is designed
5679.96 to create relief in a joint or in a limb
5683.24 that's below the tape, not
necessarily under the tape,
5686.92 but above or below.
5688.22 So for instance, if there's
pain in one shoulder,
5690.06 sometimes we'll put it
on the trapezius muscle
5693.04 or things of that sort.
5693.873 It turns out that there
is a basis for this
5696.03 because of the way that
these different nerves run in
5698.73 from the skin and from the
muscles up into the spinal cord
5702.68 and into the brainstem providing pressure
5705.33 on one nerve pathway can
often impact another pathway.
5707.96 And the simplest and most
common example of this is one
5710.81 that we all do
instinctually or intuitively
5713.02 even animals do this.
5714.82 This is something that in the
textbooks is all is called
5717.74 the Gate Theory of Pain
developed by Melzack and Wall
5720.61 kind of classic theory.
5722.37 Basically we have receptors in our skin,
5726.0 the so-called C fibers, that's just a name
5728.37 for these little wires that come
5730.25 from a particular class
of DRGs that's very thin
5733.84 that brings about certain kinds
5735.84 of nasal scepter information.
5737.5 I want to say pain information,
5738.84 but then the pain people believe
are not their pain people.
5742.23 Sometimes they're a pain
because what they tell me
5744.5 is they're on pain
receptors okay, nociceptors
5746.9 That information comes in C fibers
5750.36 and what happens when we injure something
5753.94 well, provided that we won't
damage it worse by touching it,
5757.37 oftentimes what we will do is
we will rub the source of pain
5761.42 or the location in which
we were experiencing pain.
5765.47 And it turns out that's not
an unuseful thing to do.
5770.55 When we rub our skin or an area,
5774.38 or we provide pressure nearby it,
5776.55 we activate the so-called A fibers,
5778.38 the bigger wires and
neurons that innovate,
5782.12 meaning they jut into that area of skin.
5784.55 And those A fibers, the ones that respond
5787.47 to mechanical pressure
actually are able to inhibit
5791.21 those C fibers, the ones that are carrying
5793.31 that so-called pain information.
5795.17 So rubbing an area or providing
pressure above or below
5798.92 an injury actually provides
real pain relief support
5802.99 for the location of
that injury or that pain
5806.77 because of the way that
these different patterns
5809.07 or these different types
of neurons interact
5811.6 with one another.
5812.5 And when I say it inhibits it,
5813.81 I don't mean that it like shouts at it,
5815.493 what it does is it releases
it's literally kind of
5818.34 like vomits up a little
bit of a neurotransmitter
5821.34 called GABA.
5822.28 And GABA is a
neurotransmitter that inhibits
5824.96 it quiets the activity of other neurons.
5828.21 And so it's acting as kind
of an analgesic, if you will,
5831.89 it's acting as its own
form of drug that you make
5835.69 with your body to quiet the
activity of these pain neurons.
5839.09 So rubbing a wound
provided it doesn't damage
5841.3 the wound worse or providing
pressure above or below
5845.34 typically it's above a particular injury
5848.29 can have a real effect in
relieving some of the pain
5850.76 of that injury.
5851.593 And some people have speculated
this as through fascia,
5854.06 or this is through other
bodily organs and tissues.
5857.0 And it might be we're going to
do a whole episode on fascia.
5859.36 It's extremely interesting tissue,
5861.15 but right now it seems
that the main source
5863.14 of that pain relief is through
this A fiber inhibition
5867.46 of these C fibers
so-called Melzack and Wall
5870.84 Gate Theory of Pain if
you'd like to look it up
5873.02 and learn about that further.
5875.17 Now, let's talk about a phenomenon
5876.95 that has long intrigued
and perplexed people
5880.08 for probably thousands of years.
5882.61 And that's redheads.
5885.19 You may have heard before that
redheads have a higher pain
5887.76 threshold than other individuals.
5890.06 And indeed, that is true.
5892.271 There's now a study that
looked at this mechanistically.
5896.09 There's a gene called the MC1R gene.
5900.6 And this MC1R gene encodes
5902.99 for a number of different proteins.
5905.47 Some of those proteins
of course are related
5907.78 to the production of melanin.
5909.36 This is why redheads often not always,
5911.68 but often are very fair skinned.
5913.75 Sometimes have freckles, not always.
5915.85 And of course have red hair.
5917.51 Some people are really intense ginger's
5920.1 not psychologically or emotionally
intense perhaps that too,
5923.84 but meaning their hair is very, very red.
5926.14 Others, it's a lighter red.
5927.46 So of course there's
variation here, but this gene,
5930.59 this MC1R gene is associated
with a pathway that relates
5936.2 to something that I've talked
about on this podcast before
5938.88 during the episode on hunger
and feeding and this is POMC.
5944.3 POMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin
5948.5 and POMC is cut up.
5951.24 It's cleaved into different hormones,
5953.42 including one that
enhances pain perception.
5956.72 This is melanocyte stimulating hormone.
5959.36 And another one that
blocks pain beta endorphin.
5963.15 Now, if you listen to the
episodes on testosterone
5965.76 and estrogen and the episodes
on hunger and feeding,
5969.3 some of these molecules
will start to ring a bell.
5972.23 Things like melano
stimulating hormone relate
5974.52 to pigmentation of the skin
5975.97 relate to sexual arousal, et cetera,
5978.24 but it turns out that in red heads,
5981.23 because of the fact that
they have this gene,
5983.5 this MC1R gene, the POMC
Pro-opiomelanocortin,
5989.06 that's cut into different hormones,
5991.31 melanocyte-stimulating hormones
5992.95 and another one beta endorphin.
5996.04 Beta endorphin should cue you to the fact
5999.41 that this is in the pain pathway.
6001.02 The endorphins are endogenously made,
6003.66 meaning made within our body opioids.
6006.54 They actually make us feel numb
6009.92 in response to certain kinds of pain.
6011.46 Now, not completely numb,
6012.82 but they numb or reduce
our perception of pain
6017.0 because of the ways in
which they are released
6019.47 from certain brain centers.
6020.87 We'll talk about those
brain centers in a moment.
6023.34 So what's really interesting
is that this study showed
6027.5 that the presence of these
hormones is in everybody.
6031.52 We all have melanocortin 4,
we all have beta endorphins.
6035.42 We all have POMC et cetera,
6037.6 but red heads make more of
these endogenous endorphins.
6041.73 And that's interesting.
6042.83 It allows them to buffer
against the pain response.
6046.16 I have a personal anecdote
to share with you about
6048.59 this red head and heightened levels
6050.92 of pain tolerance phenomenon.
6052.91 Obviously I'm not a redhead.
6054.59 I don't dye my hair, but
my partner for many years
6058.21 was a red head and still is a red head.
6060.56 She had bright red hair and
had that since childhood.
6065.1 Well, we had the fortunate experience
6067.249 of becoming friends
with Wim Hof and family.
6070.93 They actually came out to
visit us and did a series
6073.29 of seminars in the bay area.
6075.53 This was in 2016, as I recall.
6078.44 And my partner, she had
never done an ice bath.
6082.78 She had never done any kind
of real cold water exposure
6085.94 experience before, but as
one particular gathering
6088.72 as is often the case when women's around,
6090.58 there was an ice bath and a
number of people were getting
6092.46 into this thing.
6093.293 This was actually before a dinner event.
6094.95 And I think for most people
who have never done an ice bath
6098.05 getting in for 30 seconds
or a minute is tolerable,
6101.9 but it takes some effort.
6103.18 It takes some willpower
and take some overcoming
6105.45 that pain barrier 'cause
it is a little bit painful.
6107.83 Not a lot.
6109.94 Some people can stay in longer
three minutes, five minutes
6112.77 without much discomfort.
6114.77 What was incredible is
that without any desire
6117.71 to compete with anybody else,
6119.47 my partner redhead got into the ice bath
6122.7 and just like sat there for 10 minutes.
6124.61 In fact, at one point she
just kind of turned to me
6126.32 and said, "I don't really feel pain.
6130.82 I'm not really in pain."
6132.14 And Wim loved this.
6133.25 Wim thought it was great.
6134.19 He thought it was the most
terrific thing in the world.
6135.558 And he got back in the ice bath
6137.24 and they became fast friends,
6138.507 and I think they're
probably still fast friends.
6140.84 So in any event, that's an end of one.
6143.33 What we call an anecdata example.
6145.57 Anecdata is not really a term
that we should use too much
6148.25 'cause it's N of one
anecdotes are just that.
6151.41 They're just anecdotes.
6152.77 But it's been described many
times in various clinics
6157.068 by anesthesiologists, by
observation of coaches, et cetera,
6161.36 that redheads men and
women who are redheads
6165.17 seem to have this higher pain threshold.
6167.18 And it does seem to be because
their body naturally produces
6171.1 ways to counter the pain response.
6173.96 They produce their own endogenous opioids.
6176.8 Now this of course should not
be taken to mean that redheads
6180.57 can tolerate more pain and
therefore should be subjected
6183.06 to more pain, all it means
is that their threshold
6186.24 for pain on average, not all of them,
6188.5 but on average is shifted higher
6191.08 than that of other individuals.
6193.0 And it remains to be
determined whether or not
6195.81 other light skin, light haired individuals
6198.49 also have a heightened
level of pain threshold.
6201.0 And I should mention because
I mentioned the ice bath
6203.47 that of course pain threshold is something
6206.21 that can be built up and
provide you do that safely
6208.96 in ways that aren't damaging your tissues
6210.845 because of course, pain is a signal
6212.95 that is designed to help you
to keep from harming yourself,
6216.33 but provided that you can
do that in a way that's safe
6218.61 and doesn't damage your tissues,
6221.15 increasing your pain threshold
through the use of things
6223.36 like ice baths is something
that really can be done.
6225.99 It has a lot to do with these contextual
6228.42 or top-down modulations of the experience.
6231.41 You can tell yourself
that this is good for me,
6235.08 or I'm doing this by
choice or whatever it is.
6237.41 You can distract yourself.
6238.48 There are a huge number of different ways
6239.96 that one could do that.
6241.16 One of the more interesting ways
6243.24 for which there are actually
really good scientific data
6246.08 come from my colleagues,
Sean Mackey's Lab.
6248.87 And that actually looked at
how love and in particular,
6252.9 the experience of obsessive
love could actually counter
6257.48 the pain response, not just
in redheads, but in everybody.
6261.44 So that study I'll just briefly describe
6264.67 it involved having people
come into the laboratory
6266.68 and experience any one or a number
6268.79 of different painful stimuli,
6270.62 but they had selectively
recruited subjects
6273.41 that were in new relationships
6275.27 for which there was a
high degree of infatuation
6278.12 so much so that the people
couldn't stop thinking about
6280.71 or communicating with that new partner
6283.66 up to 80% of their waking
time, which is a lot.
6288.75 That constant obsessing about that partner
6291.6 was correlated with.
6292.76 It wasn't causal necessarily,
but was correlated with
6296.23 the ability to sustain
higher levels of pain
6299.43 than people who were in
more typical non obsessive
6304.73 forms of love, longstanding relationships,
6307.45 where there wasn't long
obsessive love rather.
6310.53 And of course in this study,
6312.09 there were a lot of good control groups.
6314.0 They included a distractor,
6316.03 they included people
obsessing about other things,
6318.82 their pet, et cetera.
6319.76 They included other forms
of love and attachment,
6323.427 but it does seem that
certain patterns of thinking
6326.42 can allow us to buffer ourselves
against the pain response.
6330.06 And that should not be surprising.
6332.56 Certain forms of thinking are
associated with the release
6335.1 of particular neuromodulators
in particular dopamine.
6338.52 And dopamine, it may
seem is kind of the thing
6341.772 that underlies everything, but it's not.
6344.2 Dopamine is a molecule that's associated
6346.85 with novelty expectation,
motivation, and reward.
6349.77 We talked about this at the
beginning of the episode,
6352.24 that it's really the molecule
of expectation and motivation
6356.4 and hope and excitement
more than it's associated
6359.76 with the receival of the reward.
6362.14 Well, dopamine is coursing
throughout the brain
6365.87 at heightened levels and
coursing throughout the body
6368.23 at heightened levels when we fall in love.
6371.19 This probably has some adaptive mechanism
6373.63 that ensure paired bonding between people
6375.98 or who knows, maybe it ensured not bonding
6378.49 to multiple people.
6379.323 Nobody really knows how dopamine functions
6382.939 in terms of pair bonding,
6384.84 but it is known that
when people fall in love,
6388.15 new relationships create
very high levels of dopamine.
6391.66 And that's probably the mechanistic basis
6394.5 by which these people were able
to buffer the pain response
6397.63 by thinking about their partner
or this new relationship
6401.36 that they're in almost
obsessively or obsessively.
6404.63 Now that raises a deeper question
6406.47 we should always be asking.
6407.43 Yeah, but how, how?
6408.73 Well, the dopamine system
can have powerful effects
6412.9 on the inflammation system.
6414.64 And it doesn't do this
through mysterious ways.
6417.1 It does this by interacting
through the brainstem
6420.28 and some of the neurons
that innervate the spleen
6423.3 and other areas of the body,
6425.45 that deploy cells to go combat infection,
6429.274 inflammation, and pain.
6431.35 And the ways in which
dopamine can modulate pain,
6434.15 and in this case, this particular study
6436.374 transform our experience of pain.
6438.48 Maybe even to something that's pleasureful
6440.814 is not mysterious.
6442.67 It's really through the
activation of brainstem neurons
6445.99 that communicate with areas of our body,
6448.82 that deploy things like immune cells.
6451.53 So for instance, we have
neurons in our brain stem
6454.214 that can be modulated by
the release of dopamine
6458.42 and those neurons in the
brainstem control the release
6461.25 of immune cells from
tissues like the spleen
6464.41 or organs like the spleen.
6465.94 And those immune cells can
then go combat infection.
6468.84 We've heard before that when we're happy,
6470.51 we're better able to combat
infection, deal with pain,
6473.65 deal with all sorts of things
6474.833 that essentially makes us more resilient.
6477.18 And that's not because dopamine
is some magic molecule,
6479.8 it's because dopamine
affects particular circuits
6482.49 and tells in a very neuro-biological way
6485.6 in a biochemical way tells
those cells and circuits
6488.82 that conditions are good.
6490.17 Despite the fact that
there's pain in the body
6492.07 conditions are good.
6492.99 You're in love or conditions are good.
6494.52 You want to be in this experience.
6496.22 Or conditions are good
this is for a greater cause
6499.35 that you're fighting or suffering
for some larger purpose.
6502.58 So all of that has existed
largely in the realm
6504.74 of psychology and even
motivational literature
6506.99 in this kind of thing,
6508.18 but there's a real
mechanistic basis for it.
6510.11 Dopamine is a molecule that
can bind to receptor sites
6512.77 on these brain areas.
6514.06 Those brain areas can then
modulate the organs and tissues
6516.64 of the body that can allow
us to lean into challenge.
6520.01 And those challenges can be infection,
6521.62 it can be physical pain, it
can be long bouts of effort
6525.84 that are required of us.
6527.09 And I think many people
have described the feeling
6530.26 of being newly in love as a
heightened level of energy,
6533.39 a capacity do anything.
6534.67 I mean, the whole concept
of a muse is one in which
6538.4 some individual or some
thing either imagined or real
6542.12 enters our life and we
can use that as fuel.
6546.68 And that fuel is chemical fuel
6548.93 and that chemical fuel is dopamine.
6550.86 And it really does allow
for more resilience
6552.79 and can even transform
the experience of pain
6555.77 or what would otherwise be pain
6557.51 into an experience of pleasure.
6559.49 So, along those lines,
let's talk about pleasure.
6562.22 With all the cells and
tissues and machinery related
6564.91 to pain, you might think
that our entire touch system
6568.54 is designed to allow us to detect pain
6571.33 and to avoid tissue damage and well,
6573.24 a good percentage of
it is devoted to that.
6576.42 A good percentage of it is also devoted
6578.45 to this thing that we call pleasure.
6580.91 And that should come as no surprise.
6583.3 Pleasure isn't just
there for our pleasure.
6586.51 It serves adaptive role,
6588.32 and that adaptive role relates to the fact
6590.52 that every species has a primary goal
6592.91 which is to make more of itself
6594.85 otherwise it would go extinct.
6598.2 That process of making more
of itself sexual reproduction
6601.62 is closely associated with the sensation
6604.37 and the perception of pleasure.
6606.09 And it's no surprise that not
only is the highest density
6610.41 of sensory receptors in and
on and around the genitalia,
6615.23 but the process of
reproduction evokes sensations
6619.13 and molecules and perceptions
associated with pleasure.
6622.5 And the currency of pleasure exists
6625.45 in multiple chemical systems
6627.21 but the primary ones
are the dopamine system,
6629.97 which is the anticipation of pleasure
6633.03 and the work required
to achieve the ability
6637.72 to experience that pleasure,
and the serotonin system
6641.61 which is more closely related
to the immediate experience
6644.57 of that pleasure.
6645.6 And from dopamine and serotonin
stem out other hormones
6649.57 and molecules, things like oxytocin,
6652.23 which are associated with pair bonding.
6653.84 Oxytocin is more closely associated
6656.04 with the serotonin system biochemically
6658.59 and at the circuit level
meaning the areas of the brain
6661.277 and body that manufacture
a lot of serotonin,
6664.15 usually not always, but
usually contain neurons
6666.31 that also manufacturer and make use
6668.62 of the molecule oxytocin.
6671.51 Those chemicals together
create sensations of warmth,
6675.46 of well being, of safety.
6678.57 The dopamine molecule is
more closely associated
6681.499 with hormones like testosterone
6683.903 and other molecules involved with pursuit
6686.99 and further effort in order
to get more of whatever
6690.54 could potentially cause
more release of dopamine.
6693.39 So this is a very broad strokes,
6695.85 no pun intended description
of the pleasure system.
6699.378 There are of course,
other molecules as well.
6701.73 One in particular that's very interesting
6704.43 is something called PEA.
6706.818 PEA, it stands for Phenethylamine
6709.92 sometimes also referred
to as Phenethylamine
6713.05 depending on who you
are and where you live,
6716.16 how you pronounce it
doesn't really matter.
6719.04 PEA is a molecule, which
is incredibly potent
6723.396 at augmenting or increasing the activity
6727.01 of certain cells and neural circuits
6729.1 that relate to the pleasure system.
6731.58 PEA has purportedly been
thought to be released
6736.15 in response to ingestion of
things like certain forms
6738.75 of dark chocolate.
6739.83 Some people take it in supplement form.
6741.81 It's a bit of a stimulant,
6744.08 but it also seems to heighten
the perception of pleasure
6747.58 in response to a particular
amount of dopamine
6750.067 and or serotonin.
6751.47 So for instance, in a kind
of a arbitrary experiment
6754.5 and units type example,
6756.22 if a given experience evokes a particular
6759.36 amount of serotonin and dopamine
6761.43 and gives rise to a subjective
experience of pleasure
6764.17 of say level three out of 10,
6766.24 the ingestion of PEA prior to
that experience can increase
6770.41 the rating of that experience
as more pleasureful.
6773.05 Maybe a four or a five, or even a six.
6775.65 And PEA is known to be present in
6779.51 or I should say it's releases stimulated
6782.04 by a number of different
compounds, such as dark chocolate,
6786.12 certain things like
aspartame and certain people
6788.82 can actually increase the
amount of PEA released.
6791.58 Some of these glutamate related
molecules like aspartame
6795.37 or things are in the glutamate pathway
6797.12 can increase PEA release.
6798.74 And then some people
will actually take PEA
6800.86 in supplement form for its
mild stimulant properties
6805.34 as well as for increasing
the perception of,
6809.01 or the ability to experience pleasure.
6811.58 It's not a sledgehammer.
6812.93 It's not like dopamine itself.
6815.672 People that take things
like Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA
6819.31 or drugs of abuse, which I
certainly don't recommend
6821.85 things like cocaine or amphetamine
6824.76 experience tremendous
increases in dopamine,
6827.95 not so much increases in serotonin.
6831.499 Some people will take
serotonin in precursor form
6835.21 like 5HTP or serotonin itself,
6837.58 or they'll take the amino acid
precursor like tryptophan.
6840.4 I'm not saying these
things as recommendations
6842.42 for increasingly one sense of pleasure,
6844.5 I'm describing them
because of what they do
6847.34 generally falls into two categories.
6850.01 The first category is
to raise the foundation,
6853.73 what we call the tonic level
of dopamine and serotonin.
6857.4 So if levels of serotonin
and dopamine are too low,
6863.34 it becomes almost impossible
to experience pleasure.
6867.5 There's a so-called anhedonia.
6869.81 This is also described as depression.
6871.85 Although it needn't be
long-term depression.
6874.69 So certain drugs like antidepressants
6877.51 like Wellbutrin Bupropion
as it's commonly called
6882.21 or the so-called SSRI,
6884.31 the serotonin selective
re-uptake inhibitors
6888.03 like Prozac, Zoloft and
similar will increase dopamine
6891.097 and serotonin respectively.
6893.3 They're not increasing the
peaks in those molecules.
6897.49 What we call the acute
release of those molecules,
6899.903 what they're doing is they're
raising the overall levels
6902.78 of those molecules.
6903.613 They're raising the sort of foundation
6905.61 or the tide if you will,
6907.01 think about it as your mood
or your pleasure rather
6909.98 is like a boat, and if it's on the shore
6912.39 and it can't get out to sea,
6913.79 unless that tide is high enough,
6915.19 that's kind of the way to
think about these tonic levels
6917.5 of dopamine and serotonin.
6919.05 Now, most of us fortunately,
6920.86 do not have problems with our
baseline or autonic levels
6925.19 of dopamine and serotonin release.
6926.991 Things like PEA in that case
will cause a slight increase
6931.07 in that tide and make the
ability of certain experiences
6936.6 to increase dopamine
further more available.
6940.24 What we call this in neurosciences
so-called gain control.
6944.13 I can kind of turn up the volume,
6946.14 bring us closer to the threshold
6948.0 to activate certain circuits.
6949.58 And this is really what we mean
6951.17 when we say a neuromodulator, okay?
6954.39 This is why when you are
very happy about something,
6957.87 let's say you're out with your friends.
6959.36 You're really excited.
6961.04 Maybe depending on where
you live and what's going on
6963.33 in your area of the world right now,
6964.73 like I have a niece and she's
been locked up in quarantine
6967.95 for a long time recently
because it was deemed safe.
6970.27 She got to go to summer camp.
6971.62 I have never seen that kid so happy
6973.622 to spend with her friends.
6977.94 She was so excited and
it was really amazing
6980.6 to see how excited she was.
6981.68 Her baseline levels of
dopamine were clearly up
6984.74 so much so that when she saw her friends,
6988.23 she literally started squealing.
6990.6 They were squealing, she was squealing.
6991.97 Everyone was squealing.
6992.803 I wasn't squealing.
6993.79 I would admit it if I was squealing.
6995.18 I wasn't squealing, but it
was such a delight to see
6997.8 and I'm sure that made
my dopamine levels go up,
6999.89 which was, she was just so
excited such that anything
7003.127 and everything felt like
an exciting stimulus.
7005.06 This is pleasure, right?
7006.86 And I don't want to
write off the experience
7008.65 from an neuro-biological
reductionist standpoint,
7011.65 quite the opposite.
7012.483 It's really beautiful to
see again this principle
7015.62 that different experiences
and the experience of pleasure
7019.88 from different things.
7021.06 Seeing your friends for the first time,
7022.45 summer camp for a kid,
7024.21 whatever it might happen to
be use the same currency,
7028.07 dopamine use the same currency serotonin.
7031.43 And this is a principle that I hope
7033.05 in listening to this podcast
7034.4 and even some of it's repetitive features
7036.19 from one episode to the next.
7038.72 I'm hoping that those will
start to embed in your mind
7040.81 that the brain and body
use these common currencies
7044.14 for different experiences.
7045.58 So yes, if your dopamine and
serotonin, or I should say
7048.76 if your dopamine and or
serotonin levels are too low,
7052.81 it will be very hard to achieve pleasure
7054.86 to experience physical
pleasure or emotional pleasure
7057.41 of any kind.
7058.7 That's why treatments of the sort
7060.75 that I described a minute
ago might be right for you.
7063.77 Obviously we can't determine
if they're right for you.
7065.53 It's also why they have side effects.
7067.17 If you artificially
increase these molecules
7069.93 they're associated with pleasure,
7071.66 oftentimes you get a lack of motivation
7073.99 to go seek things like food.
7075.41 People don't get much
interest in food 'cause
7077.207 why should they if their
serotonin levels are already up.
7080.3 Again, there's a ton of
individual variation.
7082.566 I don't want to say that
these antidepressants
7085.14 are always bad.
7086.38 Sometimes they've saved lives.
7088.34 They've saved millions of lives.
7089.67 Sometimes people have side effects
7090.96 that make them not the right choice.
7092.56 So it has to be determined
for the individual.
7095.88 Things like PEA or a more subtle effect.
7098.69 I should mention PEA
supplementation is something
7101.64 that a number of people use
but it's very short-lived.
7104.6 Because of the half-life of
this molecule was very brief,
7107.414 the effect only lasts
about 20 minutes or so.
7111.312 Things like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens
7114.4 lead to longer baseline
increases in dopamine.
7118.86 But remember, any time
you raise a baseline,
7122.14 you reduce the so-called signal to noise.
7126.24 What it means is if you're riding around
7128.12 at really high dopamine, at first,
7130.21 everything will start to seem exciting
7131.83 like my niece and seeing her
friends for the first time.
7133.77 Everything's exciting.
7134.906 But then what will happen
is when your dopamine levels
7137.51 return to more normal levels,
7139.66 it will take a much
greater dopamine increase
7142.396 of much bigger event,
more novel, more exciting
7146.06 in order to achieve the sense that
7149.03 what you're experiencing is pleasureful.
7151.41 And this is because of the relationship
7153.44 between pleasure and pain.
7155.46 Now, in a future episode
we are going to go deep
7157.67 into this relationship
between pleasure and pain,
7160.36 but just briefly as a precursor to that
7163.27 and because it's relevant
to the conversation
7165.69 that we've been having,
7168.16 you might want to be
wary of any experience,
7171.75 any experience, no matter how it arrives,
7174.76 chemical, physical, emotional,
or some combination,
7178.52 you might want to be wary
of letting your dopamine go
7181.15 too high and certainly you want to be wary
7183.32 of it going too low.
7184.24 Because of the way that
these circuits adjust.
7186.58 Basically every time that the
pleasure system is kicked in
7190.45 in high gear, an absolutely
spectacular event,
7194.22 you cannot be more ecstatic.
7196.603 There is a mirror symmetric
activation of the pain system.
7202.13 And this might seem like
an evil curse of biology,
7205.78 but it's not.
7206.613 This is actually a way to
protect this whole system
7209.465 of reward and motivation
that I talked about
7211.82 at the beginning of the episode.
7214.17 It might sound great to
just ingest substances
7216.43 or engage in behaviors
7217.47 where it's just dopamine,
dopamine, dopamine,
7219.12 and just constantly be motivated,
7221.48 but the system will eventually crash.
7224.01 And so what happens is when
you have a big increase
7225.99 in dopamine, you also
will get a big increase
7228.84 in the circuits that underlie
our sense of disappointment
7232.98 and re adjusting the balance.
7234.99 And with repeated exposure
to high levels of dopamine,
7238.04 not naturally occurring wonderful events,
7240.77 but really high chemically
induced peaks in dopamine,
7246.16 high magnitude, chemically
induced peaks in dopamine.
7249.26 What happens is those peaks in dopamine
7251.34 start to go down and down and
down in response to the same,
7255.21 what ought to be incredible experience.
7257.82 We start to what's called
habituate or attenuate,
7261.42 and yet the pain increases in size.
7265.85 And this has a preservative
function in keeping us safe,
7269.54 believe it or not.
7271.04 But what I just described
is actually the basis
7273.38 of most if not all, forms of addiction
7276.15 something that we will deal with
7277.4 in a future episode in depth.
7279.41 So what should you think about all?
7280.86 How should you think about pleasure
7281.95 and how should you think about pain?
7283.4 What is too much pleasure?
7285.27 Well, that's going to differ
from person to person,
7288.86 but to the extent that one
can access pleasure repeatedly
7293.42 over time, ideally without
chemical augmentation,
7297.68 certainly not excessive
chemical augmentation,
7300.05 that means that this pleasure
system is tuned up well
7302.7 and can continue to experience pleasure.
7304.5 However, if you find yourself engaging
7307.58 in the same behavior over and over again,
7310.12 but achieving less and
less pleasure from it,
7312.92 chances are you want to adjust down
7316.36 how often you engage in that behavior.
7320.23 And or adjust down your
expectation of reward
7324.43 every time you engage in that behavior.
7327.95 What do I mean by that?
7328.95 Well, at the beginning of the episode
7330.36 I talked about how dopamine
will allow us to get
7334.23 into bouts of hard work.
7335.82 We will work very hard to pursue a reward,
7338.94 and that's really what dopamine does.
7340.44 And then when the reward comes
7341.84 that doesn't increase our dopamine.
7344.07 In fact, our dopamine levels go down.
7348.12 One of the key things that we can all do
7350.61 to adjust our ability
to experience pleasure
7354.31 is to engage in that
intermittent reward schedule.
7358.89 You can either adjust
down the peak in dopamine,
7361.62 meaning not let yourself
ever get too happy,
7363.48 but that's no fun, right?
7364.58 Life is about occasionally achieving
7367.82 or experiencing ecstasy,
7369.61 but every once in a
while, remove the reward.
7372.86 And of course, I don't
mean ecstasy the drug
7374.32 that's a separate matter.
7375.21 The MDMA trials are a separate matter.
7376.97 Very interesting, I want to be clear.
7378.21 I meant psychological and physical ecstasy
7381.29 of the natural sort.
7383.23 I've immense interest in what's
going on in the MDMA trials,
7386.96 but just for clarity purposes,
7389.4 that's a separate topic that we will cover
7391.47 in an episode very soon.
7394.39 So how do you adjust this dopamine system?
7397.29 Well, every once in a while at random,
7400.06 not in a predictable way,
7402.66 you remove the reward
and that will keep you
7406.55 and your dopamine system
tune up in the proper ways.
7410.07 The gain of the dopamine
system, as we say,
7412.64 will be adjusted so that you can continue
7414.93 to experience dopamine and serotonin
7417.26 when you actually get the reward.
7420.42 This can be translated into a huge number
7422.9 of different domains,
7423.95 but I want to give some
examples because I'm sure
7426.38 that many of you are asking,
7427.32 wait, what does this actually mean?
7428.49 Okay, let's say you're a student,
7430.26 or this could be a student in academia,
7432.87 or this could be a student
of a physical practice.
7436.22 Every once in a while when
you do something really well,
7440.26 maybe that's even just
showing up to the practice
7442.58 rather than pat yourself on the back,
7444.752 just tell yourself
yeah, that's the minimum
7447.07 that's expected of me.
7448.15 When everyone's excited about
something that you're doing,
7450.62 maybe you're excited about it,
7452.12 try and adjust down your
excitement a little bit.
7454.86 I know this might seem counterintuitive,
7456.91 but you're preserving the
ability to experience excitement
7460.18 in a variety of contexts.
7461.98 Let's say you get a big monetary award.
7465.53 Well, that's great.
7467.75 I'm happy for you.
7468.68 And that's wonderful.
7470.34 However, you should be a little bit wary
7472.839 if you care about your dopamine system
7474.8 and you care about your ability
7475.93 to get subsequent monetary
rewards, excuse me,
7479.76 awards rewards doesn't
matter which through effort,
7482.58 if you want to be able
to maintain the ability
7484.58 to exert effort, well,
then you probably wouldn't
7487.13 want to run out and
immediately buy something
7489.5 with that monetary reward.
7491.2 In other words, you
wouldn't want to layer on
7492.65 more dopamine release, okay?
7495.56 You might, but you might not.
7497.83 You might skip it.
7499.16 What you'll find then
is that your motivation
7501.188 is essentially infinite.
7503.11 This is what I described at
the beginning of the episode.
7505.51 And again, it's because
dopamine is this currency.
7508.71 It's like these days you
hear a lot about Bitcoin,
7510.987 and Ethereum, and
Dogecoin, and USs dollars,
7514.54 and Euros and other stuff.
7516.74 But the currency that you use in your body
7520.78 doesn't matter what
external currency those are.
7523.17 In fact, as you watch the value
7524.74 of different currencies go up
7526.24 whether or not it's cryptocurrency
or standard currency,
7529.1 the value is actually
reflective of the dopamine
7531.61 that exists inside of people.
7533.85 So all the excitement
about a particular currency
7536.45 crypto or otherwise is
really just dopamine.
7539.66 That's the currency that we all use.
7542.93 And there's no negotiating that.
7544.71 That's just the way that we're built.
7546.79 Now, to give yet other examples.
7548.83 Let's say you're teaching other
people how to do something
7551.14 and they do something exceptionally well.
7553.36 If you reward them every single time.
7555.77 and in particular, if you
reward them with something
7558.03 that's even greater than the
experience of what they did.
7560.95 So let's say kids win a soccer game
7562.86 and they're ecstatic.
7564.14 They're jumping all over the place.
7565.16 They're super excited and you reward them
7567.78 with an even bigger
experience, a celebration,
7570.95 you are actually inhibiting their ability
7574.55 to perform the same set of activities
7577.68 that led them to the win if,
and I really want to underscore
7581.08 if you reward them every time.
7582.96 Of course we should
reward kids and each other
7586.29 and ourselves for our accomplishments,
7588.43 but you don't want to do it every time.
7590.82 And sure there will be some disappointment
7593.03 from suddenly removing the
reward that you expected,
7597.89 but that's exactly the point.
7599.21 That's what keeps these
circuits tuned up properly.
7601.86 Now there's the other form of pleasure,
7603.34 which is the more immediate visceral
7607.08 or sensory experience of pleasure.
7609.27 This is distinct from goals
and goal-directed behavior.
7611.76 I'm talking about the
immediate experience.
7613.35 This is more of the serotonergic system.
7615.83 There are other systems involved too,
7617.6 but this is also the system
7618.75 that draws out those endogenous opioids
7622.89 from a particular structure.
7624.14 We have a structure in the
back of our brain called PAG
7626.51 P-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray area.
7630.04 Very interesting brain area
that is associated with pain,
7633.34 but also with pleasure because
under certain conditions,
7636.5 it deploys endogenous opioids and gives us
7640.006 a kind of blissed out feeling.
7642.3 This is not like the opioids
of the opioid epidemic sort
7645.63 that people take and
unfortunately have led
7647.715 to tremendous amounts
of suffering and abuse.
7650.49 These are endogenously released opioids.
7653.0 These are the kinds of
opioids that come out
7654.43 from long distance bouts of
physical exercise and running.
7658.09 These are the opioids that are deployed
7660.17 in response to giving birth
7662.3 and overcoming the tremendous
pain of childbirth.
7665.83 So PAG is very contextual
and there are few types
7670.09 of stimuli or I should
say events in life...
7673.84 I'm really showing my nerdy side.
7675.31 There are a few types of stimulate,
7676.78 I'm talking about experiences
that evoke endogenous opioid
7680.79 release from PAG.
7682.3 One is sexual activity.
7685.05 Sexual activity can
increase pain threshold.
7688.43 And here I am not suggesting
or getting involved
7692.85 in anyone's particular proclivities
or personal experiences.
7695.55 You're welcome to editorialize
this however you like,
7698.06 however, what I'm talking
about are animal data
7701.23 and yes, human data as well,
7703.23 that show that pain
thresholds are increased
7705.3 anytime PAG is activated
because of the release
7708.45 of these endogenous opioids.
7711.55 There's also the immediate experience
7715.07 of whether or not a
particular form of touch
7717.26 is pleasureful or not.
7718.82 And there there's some
very interesting biology
7720.78 that relates to really
how those little wires
7723.47 from those DRGs innovate our skin.
7726.66 Work studies I should say
done by David Ginty's lab
7730.43 at Harvard Medical School,
7731.54 the Ginty lab has spent years working
7734.2 on the somata sensory
system, the touch system
7737.88 has identified a particular
category of neurons
7740.42 that innervate the skin
and then those neurons
7741.769 of course send that information
up to the brain too.
7744.66 And they actually respond
to direction of touch.
7748.46 Now, some of you might be more sensitive
7750.27 to this than others, but it turns out that
7753.12 certain hairs like to be
deflected one way versus another.
7758.72 Whether you like cats or not,
you can do this experiment.
7762.04 You can pet a cat in the
direction that they're fur lies.
7765.16 So it lies down in a particular direction.
7766.78 You'll notice that there's actually a gene
7768.09 that dictates that the hairs lie down
7769.72 in a particular direction.
7770.83 And if you pet them in a way that's
7776.33 co-operating with that direction.
7778.13 So not pushing the hairs up,
7779.37 but rather stroking the
hairs on the back of the cat.
7782.58 Well, you'll notice as
they often like that.
7784.1 Not all cats some cats are pretty grouchy,
7785.91 but if you stroke their hair,
7788.28 they will often per,
they'll often push into you.
7791.31 If you were to stroke their
hair in the opposite direction,
7793.86 pushing the hairs up against the direction
7796.22 that they want to lie down,
cats do not like that.
7799.227 And it turns out that people
don't like that either.
7801.17 Some people do like to
have their hair pushed
7803.08 in a direction against the direction
7805.27 in which it wants to lay down.
7807.06 But there is more typically response
7810.8 a feeling like it's
pleasureful for instance,
7813.25 when someone brushes or combs their hair
7814.86 in the direction that
it wants to lay down.
7816.43 And that's because the way
in which these neurons,
7819.21 they innovate these hairs
sends information up
7822.16 to the brain bifurcates actually,
7823.84 it splits into brain centers
7825.78 that evoke a sense of pleasure
or a sense of not pleasure.
7828.55 It's not necessarily pain.
7830.17 So you might find that certain
people are very particular.
7834.06 They like to be touched in a
certain way, but not others.
7836.24 You might be one of those people.
7837.88 And areas of our skin
that have high density
7840.43 of receptors are very, very
sensitive in a real way,
7845.76 in a real sense of the
word to patterns of touch
7849.64 and whether or not a touch
is too firm or too light.
7853.73 And that will be modulated
by overall levels of arousal.
7858.6 And when I talk about arousal,
7859.82 what I'm talking about is how
alert or how sleep we are.
7862.51 It is impossible to experience pain
7865.32 when we are deep in sleep.
7867.66 I don't mean sleeping like
of the typical night's sort.
7869.65 I mean, of the anesthesia sort.
7870.85 That's the purpose of anesthesia
to bring the brain and body
7873.4 into a deep plane of
rest, very deep in fact,
7876.81 and it's very hard if
not impossible to achieve
7881.21 or experience pleasure when
we are in a very low state
7884.75 of arousal as well.
7886.37 When we are in heightened
states of arousal,
7889.12 we can achieve pain,
we can experience pain
7892.16 and we can experience pleasure.
7895.08 And under those heightened
states of arousal,
7898.69 we are more sensitive.
7900.02 Literally the passage
of electrical signals
7903.12 from those locations on the body
7905.23 that have heightened degrees
or higher degrees, I should say
7908.67 of receptors, use your imagination.
7911.19 They include the lips, the
face, the feet, and the genitals
7913.59 and nearby areas, literally nearby areas.
7918.08 Under conditions of higher
arousal two things happen,
7921.66 the ability to achieve
or experience pleasure
7924.09 at those locations goes up
7925.97 and our tolerance and our
threshold for pain also goes up.
7929.44 So the principle here is that
as our levels of arousal,
7932.76 that foundation of
arousal goes up or down,
7935.54 so too goes up and down our ability
7938.39 to achieve pleasure and pain.
7940.37 And so these two extremes of
being deep within anesthesia
7942.566 or another extreme as asleep
7946.41 or an heightened levels of arousal,
7948.76 our ability to achieve pleasure and pain
7950.46 are going to scale according to those.
7952.58 And this is why, and I'm
certainly not suggesting this,
7955.26 but this is why some
people will take stimulants
7958.89 or drugs of abuse that increase arousal
7961.07 in order to achieve
pleasure of other kinds.
7964.26 The problem is is that
those drugs in particular
7966.59 are things like cocaine and
methamphetamine and amphetamine
7969.81 become their own form of reinforcement
7971.96 so much so that the
person doesn't seek out
7976.15 any other form of excitement or arousal.
7979.87 So today we weren't
talking about addiction.
7982.85 We weren't necessarily
talking about motivation,
7985.01 but we touched on those
topics as sort of a precursor
7987.27 of what's to come.
7988.91 We talked about the pathways
in the skin and in the brain
7991.78 and elsewhere in the body
7993.23 that control our sense
of pleasure and pain.
7995.02 We described a number of
different tools ranging
7997.27 from hypnosis to different supplements,
7999.11 to electroacupuncture
and various other tools
8003.38 that one could use to modulate your sense
8004.99 of pleasure or pain.
8006.74 And of course, in thinking about pleasure,
8008.94 we have to think about the dopamine system
8010.137 and the serotonin system
8011.187 and some of the related chemical systems.
8013.56 I realized that today's podcast
8015.06 had a lot of scientific details.
8017.57 We've timestamped everything for you
8019.02 so that you don't have to
digest it all at once of course
8022.35 I don't expect that everyone would be able
8024.04 to understand all these
details all at once.
8026.395 What's more important
really is to understand
8029.89 the general principles of how something
8032.1 like pleasure and pain work.
8033.69 How they interact, and
the very seldom systems
8036.39 within the brain and body
that allow them to occur
8038.78 and that modulator or change
their ability to occur.
8042.47 And of course your subjective experience
8044.45 of pleasure or pain.
8045.72 So I do hope that this was
on hole more pleasureful
8049.23 than painful for you.
