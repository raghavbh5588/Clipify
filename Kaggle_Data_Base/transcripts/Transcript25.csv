0.3,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.25,where we discuss science 
3.69,and science-based tools for everyday life. 
9.27,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.38,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.23,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.0,"Today, my guest is Dr. David Anderson, "
17.43,Dr. Anderson is a professor of biology 
19.38,"at the California Institute of Technology, "
21.96,often commonly referred to as Caltech University. 
25.44,Dr. Anderson's research focuses on emotions 
28.05,"and states of mind and body, "
30.0,"and indeed he emphasizes how emotions, "
31.83,"like happiness, sadness, anger and so on, "
34.56,are actually subcategories 
36.27,"of what are generally governed by states, "
39.33,"that is, things that are occurring "
41.25,in the nervous system in our brain 
43.02,and in the connections between brain and body 
45.75,that dictate whether or not 
46.71,"we feel good about how we are feeling, "
48.78,"and that drive our behaviors, "
50.64,"that is, bias us to be in action or inaction "
54.54,and strongly influence the way we interpret 
56.82,our experience and our surroundings. 
58.68,"Today, Dr. Anderson teaches us, for instance, "
61.14,why people become aggressive 
62.67,and why that aggression can sometimes take the form of rage. 
66.9,"We also talk about sexual behavior, "
68.88,and the boundaries and overlap 
71.25,between aggression and sexual behavior. 
73.62,And that discussion about aggression and sexual behavior 
76.59,also starts to focus on particular aspects 
79.11,of neural circuits and states of mind and body 
81.36,"that govern things like, for instance, "
83.67,"male-male aggression, "
84.78,"versus male-female aggression, "
86.4,versus female-female aggression. 
88.77,"So today, you will learn a lot "
90.06,about the biological mechanisms 
91.47,that govern why we feel the way we feel. 
93.9,"Indeed, Dr. Anderson is an author "
95.82,"of a terrific new popular book, "
97.86,"entitled ""The Nature of the Beast: How Emotions Guide Us"". "
101.01,"I've read this book several times now, "
103.093,I can tell you it contains so many gems 
105.03,that are firmly grounded in the scientific research. 
107.52,"In fact, a lot of what's in the book "
109.5,contrasts with many of the common myths 
111.69,about emotions and biology. 
113.91,"So whether or not you're a therapist, "
115.41,"or you're a biologist, "
116.52,or you're simply just somebody interested 
118.5,in why we feel the way we feel 
120.21,"and why we act the way we act, "
122.1,I cannot recommend the book highly enough. 
123.9,"Again, the title is "
124.733,"""The Nature of the Beast: How Emotions Guide Us"". "
127.2,Today's discussion also ventures into topics 
129.48,"such as mental health and mental illness, "
132.12,and some of the exciting discoveries 
133.95,that have been made by Dr. Anderson's laboratory 
135.72,"and other laboratories identifying specific peptides, "
138.6,"that is, small proteins "
140.43,that can govern whether or not people 
141.96,"feel anxious or less anxious, "
143.67,aggressive or less aggressive. 
145.35,This is an important area of research 
147.12,that has direct implications 
148.47,"for much of what we read about in the news, "
150.57,"both unfortunate and fortunate events, "
153.06,and that will no doubt drive the future 
155.58,of mental health treatments. 
157.05,Dr. Anderson is considered one of the most pioneering 
160.62,and important researchers in neurobiology of our time. 
163.83,"Indeed, he is a member of the National Academy of Sciences "
165.96,and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. 
169.11,I've mentioned the HHMI once or twice before 
171.42,"when we've had other HHMI guests on this podcast, "
174.45,"but for those of you that are not familiar, "
175.86,the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
177.21,funds a small number of investigators 
179.37,"doing particularly high-risk, high-benefit work, "
182.79,and it is an extremely competitive process 
185.58,to identify those Howard Hughes investigators. 
188.79,"They are essentially appointed, "
189.72,"and then every five years, "
191.55,they have to compete against one another 
193.74,and against a new incoming flock 
196.08,of would-be HHMI investigators 
198.69,to get another five years of funding. 
199.92,They are literally given a grade every five years 
202.11,"as to whether or not they can continue, not continue, "
204.57,or whether or not they should worry 
206.01,about being funded for an extended period of time. 
208.53,Dr. Anderson has been an investigator 
210.3,with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 
1989.,
213.87,I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast 
215.73,is now partnered with Momentous supplements. 
218.07,We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons. 
220.29,"First of all, they ship internationally, "
222.0,because we know that many of you are located 
223.92,outside of the United States. 
225.39,"Second of all, and perhaps most important, "
227.4,"the quality of their supplements is second to none, "
229.98,both in terms of purity 
231.03,and precision of the amounts of the ingredients. 
233.58,"Third, we've really emphasized supplements "
236.22,"that are single-ingredient supplements, "
238.29,and that are supplied in dosages 
240.48,that allow you to build a supplementation protocol 
243.45,"that's optimized for cost, "
245.28,"that's optimized for effectiveness, "
247.14,and that you can add things 
248.64,and remove things from your protocol 
250.29,in a way that's really systematic and scientific. 
252.39,If you'd like to see the supplements 
253.59,"that we partner with Momentous on, "
254.91,you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman. 
258.0,"There, you'll see those supplements, "
259.14,and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding 
261.63,the library of supplements available through Momentous 
264.3,on a regular basis. 
265.26,"Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. "
267.84,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize "
269.55,that this podcast is separate from my teaching 
271.41,and research roles at Stanford. 
273.0,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
275.19,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
277.71,and science-related tools to the general public. 
280.23,"In keeping with that theme, "
281.34,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
284.13,"Our first sponsor is Levels, "
285.93,Levels is a program that lets you see 
287.4,how different foods affect your health 
289.02,by giving you real-time feedback on your diet 
291.03,using a continuous glucose monitor. 
293.46,One of the most important factors 
294.75,governing our immediate and long-term health 
296.46,and indeed our ability to think and focus clearly 
299.61,"is our blood glucose levels, "
301.17,also referred to as blood sugar. 
303.03,"To maintain healthy energy and focus throughout the day, "
305.16,you want to keep your blood glucose levels steady 
307.11,and avoid peaks and crashes. 
309.48,I first started using Levels about a year ago 
311.76,"as a way to better understand how specific foods, "
314.04,"food combinations, exercise and supplements "
316.71,"impact my blood glucose levels, "
318.45,and it's been tremendously informative. 
320.19,"In fact, it's changed and shaped "
321.69,the way that I organize my entire day. 
323.88,Levels even provides a simple score 
325.41,after you eat a meal 
326.61,so you can see how different foods affect you 
328.11,and develop a personalized nutrition program 
330.12,that's ideal for you. 
331.71,So if you're interested in learning more about Levels 
333.54,"and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, "
335.49,"you can go to levels.link/huberman, "
338.07,that's levels.link/huberman. 
341.4,Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. 
344.04,Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows 
346.08,that are of the absolute highest quality. 
347.97,"They also have some really unique features, "
350.01,because they are customized to your unique sleep needs. 
353.49,I've talked over and over again on this podcast 
355.38,and on other podcasts 
356.67,about the fact that sleep 
357.69,"is the foundation of mental health, "
359.7,"physical health and performance, "
361.26,there's just simply no other substitute 
363.09,for a quality night's sleep on a regular basis. 
365.61,I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress 
366.99,for well over a year now 
368.04,"and it's the best sleep that I've ever had, "
369.96,and that's in large part 
371.34,because the mattress was designed for me. 
374.07,"What you need to know, however, "
375.06,"is what's the ideal mattress for you, "
376.62,"and you can do that by going to Helix's site, "
378.99,"you can take their brief quiz, "
380.28,"which will ask you, ""Do you sleep on your side, "
382.2,"your back, your stomach? "
383.033,"Or maybe you don't know, or maybe all three. "
384.6,Do you tend to run hot or cold in the night? 
386.13,"Maybe you know, maybe you don't."" "
388.08,"At the end of that short quiz, "
389.1,they will match you to the ideal mattress for you. 
390.78,"I matched to the Dusk, the D-U-S-K mattress, "
393.12,"but again, that's what I need, "
394.62,that's not necessarily what you need 
395.82,in order to get your best night's sleep. 
397.68,"But if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, "
399.24,"go to helixsleep.com/huberman, "
401.46,take their two-minute sleep quiz 
402.72,and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you 
404.55,and you'll get up to $
200,off any mattress order 
407.82,"and two free pillows, "
408.99,they have terrific pillows. 
409.92,And you get to try out that mattress 
411.03,for 
100,nights risk free. 
412.23,"They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it, "
414.18,but I'm certain you will. 
415.41,"Again, if you're interested in it, "
416.243,you go to helixsleep.com/huberman 
418.68,for up to $
200,off your mattress order 
420.84,and two free pillows. 
422.16,Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. 
424.761,LMNT is an electrolyte drink 
426.27,that has everything you need 
427.35,"and nothing you don't, meaning no sugar, "
429.99,"but it has sodium, magnesium and potassium "
432.6,in the proper ratios. 
433.74,"Sodium, magnesium and potassium "
435.03,"are critical for the functioning of all your cells, "
437.58,"but of your neurons, your nerve cells in particular. "
440.28,"Many people out there, believe it or not, "
442.17,"need to ingest more sodium and more potassium, "
445.05,and magnesium in the proper ratios 
447.24,to sodium and potassium. 
449.07,"For those of you that are prehypertensive or hypertensive, "
451.23,"you definitely don't want to crank up your sodium intake, "
453.09,"but many people out there, "
453.99,especially people following low-carb diets 
456.39,or eating exceptionally clean 
458.49,very well may need more sodium. 
460.92,"And by drinking LMNT mixed with water, "
462.81,"which is what I do once or twice a day, "
464.34,"and certainly also during workouts and after workouts, "
467.4,you can optimize mental functioning and physical performance 
470.64,by increasing your electrolyte balance in the proper ratios. 
474.69,"If you'd like to try LMNT, "
475.68,"you can go to drinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T, .com/huberman, "
479.91,and you'll get a free sample pack with your order. 
481.92,"Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman "
485.31,to get a free sample pack with your order. 
487.38,And now for my discussion with Dr. David Anderson. 
490.77,"David, great to be here "
491.85,and great to finally sit down and chat with you. 
494.13,"- Great to be here too, thank you so much. "
496.02,"- Yeah, I have a ton of questions, "
497.43,"but I want to start with something fairly basic, "
500.28,"but that I'm aware is a pretty vast landscape, "
503.64,"and that's the difference between emotions and states, "
507.66,"if indeed there is a difference, "
508.95,and how we should think about emotions. 
511.89,What are they? 
513.54,"They have all these names, "
514.5,"happiness, sadness, depression, anger, rage, "
518.76,how should we think about them 
519.96,and why might states be 
522.75,"at least as useful a thing to think about, "
525.45,if not more useful? 
526.95,- That's great. 
528.39,"First, the short answer to your question "
530.4,"is that I see emotions as a type of internal state, "
535.4,"in the sense that arousal's also a type of internal state, "
538.87,"motivation's a type of internal state, "
541.29,sleep is a type of internal state. 
544.23,And the sort of simplest way 
546.72,"I think of internal states is that, "
549.21,"as you've shown in your own work, "
550.5,they change the input-to-output transformation of the brain. 
555.36,"When you're asleep, you don't hear something "
558.24,"that you would hear if you were awake, "
560.13,"unless it's a really, really loud noise. "
562.26,"So from that broad perspective, "
565.05,I see emotion as a class of state 
568.35,that controls behavior. 
570.21,The reason I think it's useful to think about it as a state 
573.81,is it puts the focus on it as a neurobiological process 
579.3,rather than as a psychological process. 
582.6,And this gets around all of the definitional problems 
586.47,"that people have with the word emotion, "
589.56,"where many people equate emotion with feeling, "
593.43,which is a subjective sense 
595.62,"that we can only study in humans, "
599.04,"because to find out what someone's feeling, "
601.74,"you have to ask them, "
602.79,"and people are the only animals that can talk, "
605.61,that we can understand. 
607.23,"So that's how I think about emotion, "
612.19,"if you think of an iceberg, "
613.38,it's the part of the iceberg 
615.54,"that's below the surface of the water, "
618.06,the feeling part is the tip 
620.22,that's sort of floating above 
621.63,the surface of your consciousness. 
623.7,"Not that that isn't important, it is, "
625.77,but you have to understand consciousness 
628.26,"if you want to understand feelings, "
630.36,"and we're not ready to study that in animals yet, "
633.81,and so that's how I think about it. 
636.42,- What are the different components of a state? 
640.14,"You mentioned arousal as a key component, "
643.59,what are some of the other features of states 
645.81,"that represent this, as you so beautifully put in your book, "
650.25,that represent below the tip 
651.78,"of the iceberg? - Right, right. "
653.22,"So you can break states up into different facets, "
661.83,"or people would call them dimensions, "
663.84,and so there have been people 
666.03,who have thought of emotions 
668.25,"as having just really two dimensions, "
671.33,"an arousal dimension, how intense is it? "
676.68,"And also a valence dimension, "
680.28,"which is, is it positive or negative, good or bad? "
684.12,Ralph Adolphs and I have tried 
685.92,to expand that a little bit 
688.35,"to think about components of emotion, "
691.05,particularly those that distinguish emotion states 
694.11,"from motivational states, "
696.12,because they are very closely related. 
699.63,"One of those important properties is persistence, "
704.04,and this is something that distinguishes 
706.53,state-driven behaviors from simple reflexes. 
710.34,"Reflexes tend to terminate when the stimulus turns off, "
715.77,"like the doctor hitting your knee with a hammer, "
718.47,it initiates with the stimulus onset 
720.9,"and it terminates with the stimulus offset, "
723.66,"emotions tend to outlast, often, "
726.18,the stimulus that evoke them. 
728.34,"If you're walking along a trail here in Southern California, "
732.51,"you hear a rattlesnake rattling, "
735.15,"you're going to jump in the air, "
736.92,but your heart is going to continue to beat 
739.26,and your palms sweat and your mouth is going to be dry 
742.53,"for a while after it's slithered off in the bush, "
745.44,"and you're going to be hypervigilant, "
747.21,if you see something 
748.41,"that even remotely looks snake-like, a stick, "
751.62,you're going to stop and jump. 
753.51,"So persistence is an important feature of emotion states, "
759.51,not all states have persistence. 
762.45,"So for example, you think about hunger. "
765.39,"Once you've eaten, the state is gone, "
768.45,"you're not hungry anymore, "
770.07,but if you are really angry 
772.35,"and you get into a fight with somebody, "
774.33,"even after the fight is over, "
776.07,you may remain riled up for a long time 
779.787,"and it takes you a while to calm down, "
782.28,and that may have to do with the arousal dimension 
785.31,or some other part of it. 
787.5,And then generalization 
790.32,"is an important component of emotion states that make them, "
797.04,"if they have been triggered in one situation, "
801.33,they can apply to another situation. 
804.36,"And my favorite example of that is, "
806.49,"you come home from work and your kid is screaming, "
809.97,"if you had a good day at work, "
811.56,"you might pick it up and sooth it, "
813.687,"and if you had a bad day at work, "
815.91,you might react very differently to it and scream at it. 
819.27,And so that's a generalization 
821.43,"of the state that was triggered at work, "
824.13,"by something your boss said to you, "
826.05,to a completely different interaction. 
828.87,"And again, that's something that distinguishes "
831.45,"emotion states from motivation states, "
834.42,"motivation states are really specific, "
837.21,"find and eat food, "
839.31,"obtain and consume water, "
842.01,and they're involved in homeostatic maintenance. 
846.93,"So states are very multifaceted, "
851.88,and just asking questions 
855.93,"about how these components of states are encoded, "
859.68,like what makes a state persist? 
862.62,What gives a state a positive or a negative valance? 
866.31,How do you crank up or crank down 
868.56,the intensity of the state? 
870.24,It just opens up a whole bunch of questions 
872.85,that you can ask in the brain 
875.13,with the kinds of tools we have now. 
878.46,"- You mentioned arousal a few times, "
880.11,"and you mentioned valence, "
882.66,"realizing that there are these other aspects of states, "
885.66,I'd like to just talk about 
886.89,"arousal a little bit more, and valence, "
888.45,"because at a very basic level, "
890.25,"it seems to me that arousal, "
892.41,"we can be very alert and pissed off, "
896.73,"stressed, worried, we can have insomnia, "
901.14,we can also be very alert and be quite happy. 
903.48,"So the valence flips, people can be sexually aroused, "
908.34,people can be aroused in all sorts of ways. 
911.19,Is there any simple or simple-ish neurochemical signature 
916.44,that can flip valence? 
917.97,"So for instance, is there any way that we can safely say "
920.79,that arousal with some additional dopamine release 
925.68,"is going to be of positive valence, "
928.2,and arousal with very low dopamine 
931.59,is going to be of negative valence? 
934.8,"- I would be reluctant to say that it's a chemical flip, "
939.27,I would say it's more likely to be 
941.52,a circuit flip. - Mm-hmm. 
943.2,- Different circuits being engaged. 
944.787,"And it might be that a given neurochemical, even dopamine, "
948.96,is involved in both positively valanced arousal 
952.65,"and negatively valanced arousal, "
955.02,that's why people think about these as different axes. 
959.28,"So I think the interesting question that you touch on is, "
964.56,is arousal something that is just completely generic 
967.95,"in the brain, "
969.0,or are there actually different kinds of arousal 
972.96,that are specific to different behaviors? 
975.33,"And you raise the question, "
976.41,sexual arousal feels different 
978.69,"from aggressive arousal, for example, "
981.51,"and we actually published a paper on this, "
984.48,back in 
"2009,","in fruit flies, "
987.66,where we found some evidence 
989.91,for two types of arousal states. 
992.82,"One of which is sleep-wake arousal, "
995.64,you're more aroused when you wake up 
997.38,"than when you're asleep, "
998.61,"and flies show that, "
999.9,"and the other is a startle response, "
1003.68,"an arousal response to a mechanical stimulus, "
1006.74,and not just mechanical stimulus. 
1008.78,"If you puff air on flies, "
1010.73,kind of like trying to swat the wasp away 
1013.49,"from your burger at a picnic table, "
1015.62,they come back more and more and more vigorously. 
1018.8,And we were able to dissect this 
1021.2,and show that although both of those forms of arousal 
1025.19,"required dopamine, they were exerted "
1029.3,through completely separable neural circuits in the fly. 
1033.47,"And so that really put, number one, "
1036.08,the emphasis on it's the circuit 
1038.21,"that determines the type of arousal, "
1040.64,"but also that arousal isn't unitary, "
1044.09,that there are behavior-specific forms of arousal. 
1047.39,And I think the jury is still out 
1049.79,as to whether there is such a thing 
1052.37,as completely generalized arousal or not. 
1055.727,"And I think some people would argue there is, "
1058.43,but I think more attention needs to be paid to this question 
1062.06,of domain-specific or behavior-specific forms of arousal. 
1066.59,"- Yeah, it's a super-interesting idea, "
1068.18,"'cause I always thought of arousal as along a continuum, "
1070.22,like you can either be in a panic attack 
1072.02,"at the one end of the extreme, "
1073.13,"or you can be in a coma, "
1074.27,"and then somewhere in the middle, you're alert and calm, "
1076.7,"but then this issue of valence really, as you say, "
1080.57,presents this opportunity 
1081.65,that really there might be multiple circuits for arousal. 
1084.57,- Yeah. - Or multiple mechanisms 
1087.08,"that would include neurochemicals, as well as "
1089.33,different neural pathways. - Yeah. 
1091.22,"- So like to talk a bit about a state, "
1095.09,"if it is indeed a state, which is aggression, "
1098.03,your labs worked extensively on this. 
1100.49,"And if you would, could you highlight "
1102.89,"some of the key findings there, "
1105.02,which brain areas that are involved? 
1107.54,The beautiful work of Dayu Lin and others in your lab 
1112.04,that point to the idea 
1113.6,"that indeed there are kind of switches in the brain, "
1117.14,but that thinking of switches for aggression 
1120.26,"might be too simple, "
1122.54,how should we think about aggression? 
1124.37,And I'll just sort of skew the question 
1127.19,"a bit more by saying, "
1128.78,"we see lots of different kinds of aggression, "
1131.66,"this terrible school shooting down in Texas recently, "
1136.31,"clearly an act that included aggression, "
1138.29,"and yet, you could imagine "
1140.15,that's a very different type of aggression 
1141.35,"than an all-out rage or a controlled aggression, "
1145.49,there's a lot of variation there. 
1146.66,"So what are your thoughts on aggression, "
1149.03,"how it's generated, the neural circuit mechanisms "
1150.98,and some of the variation in what we call aggression? 
1153.8,"- Yeah, this is a great question, "
1155.3,and it's a large area. 
1157.67,"I would say that, first of all, "
1161.3,"the word aggression, in my mind, "
1164.75,refers more to a description of behavior 
1168.32,than it does to an internal state. 
1172.34,Aggression could reflect an internal state 
1175.28,"that we would call anger in humans, "
1178.25,"or could reflect fear, "
1180.56,or it could reflect hunger if it's predatory aggression. 
1185.057,And so this gets at the issue that you raised 
1187.67,of the different types of aggression that exist. 
1191.39,The work that Dayu did when she was in my lab 
1195.68,that really broke open the field 
1198.71,to the application of modern genetic tools 
1201.74,for studying circuits in mice 
1203.99,is that she found a way to evoke aggression in mice 
1209.9,using optogenetics to activate specific neurons 
1215.45,"in a region of the hypothalamus, "
1218.33,"the ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH, "
1221.3,which people had been studying 
1223.34,"and looking at for decades, "
1227.42,"following, first, the work of, "
1231.11,"in cats, the famous Nobel Prize-winning work "
1234.74,"of Walter Hess, "
1236.45,and then followed by work 
1238.37,"done by Menno Kruk, in the Netherlands, in rats, "
1242.57,where they would stick electrical wires into the brain 
1246.92,"and send electric currents into the brain, "
1249.59,and they could trigger a placid cat 
1252.8,"to suddenly bare its teeth, hiss "
1256.04,"and almost strike out at the experimenter, "
1259.37,and they could trigger rats to fight with each other. 
1263.45,"And even in Hess's original experiments, "
1267.17,he describes two types of aggression 
1269.96,that he evokes from cats 
1271.91,depending on where in the hypothalamus 
1274.61,"he puts his electrode, "
1276.83,"one of which he calls defensive rage, "
1280.01,"that's the ears laid back, teeth bared and hissing. "
1284.33,"And the other one is predatory aggression, "
1287.54,"where the cat has its ears forward, "
1290.63,"and it's batting with its paw at a mouse-like object, "
1294.38,like it wants to catch it and eat it. 
1296.78,"So he already had, at that stage, "
1299.3,some information about segregation in the brain 
1302.78,of different forms of aggression. 
1304.76,So fast forward to 
"2008,",
"2009,",
1312.98,when Dayu came to the lab 
1314.75,"and we had started working on aggression in fruit flies, "
1318.14,and I wanted to bring it into mice 
1320.81,so that we could apply genetic tools. 
1323.21,"And we started by having Dayu, "
1325.46,"who was an electrophysiologist, "
1328.13,just repeat the electrical stimulation 
1331.76,"of the ventromedial hypothalamus in the mouse, "
1335.21,"just like people had done in rats, "
1337.76,"in cats, in hamsters, even in monkeys. "
1340.58,And she could not get that experiment to work 
1343.52,over 
40,"different trials, "
1346.37,it just didn't work. 
1347.51,"What she got instead was fear behaviors, "
1351.08,"she got freezing, cornering and crouching. "
1355.76,"And finally, in desperation, "
1359.09,"and we got a lot of input from Menno Kruk on this, "
1361.76,"he really was mystified, "
1362.997,"""Why doesn't it work in mice?"" "
1364.82,We realized why there had been no paper 
1367.67,on brain-stimulated aggression in mice in 
50,"years, "
1372.44,'cause the experiment doesn't work. 
1374.87,And the one bit of credit I can claim there 
1379.19,"is I convinced Dayu to try optogenetics, "
1383.39,"because it just had sort of come into use deep in the brain, "
1389.75,from Karl Deisseroth and others' work. 
1393.11,And I thought maybe because it could be 
1395.45,directed more specifically to a region of the brain 
1399.35,"and types of cells than electrical stimulation, "
1404.66,it might work. 
1405.5,"And Dayu said, ""Never, never going to work. "
1407.84,"If it doesn't work with electricity, "
1409.58,"why should it work with optogenetics?"" "
1412.67,"And the fact is that it did work, "
1415.43,and we were able to trigger aggression in this region 
1420.14,using optogenetic stimulation of ventromedial hypothalamus. 
1424.01,"And in retrospect, I think the reason "
1426.59,that we were seeing all these fear behaviors 
1430.28,"is because right at the upper part, "
1433.73,if you think of ventromedial hypothalamus 
1436.7,"like a pear sitting on the ground, "
1439.25,the fat part of the pear near the ground 
1441.95,"is where the aggression neurons are, "
1443.84,but the upper part of the pear has fear neurons. 
1447.47,"And it could be because it's so small in a mouse, "
1451.1,"when you inject electrical current anywhere in the pear, "
1455.12,it flows up through the entire pear 
1457.61,"and it activates the fear circuits, "
1459.74,and those totally dominate aggression. 
1462.77,And so that's why we were never able to see 
1465.5,"any fighting with electrical stimulation, "
1468.02,"whereas when you use optogenetics, "
1469.7,you confine the stimulation just to the region 
1474.08,where you've implanted the channelrhodopsin gene 
1478.46,into those neurons. 
1481.13,"And so fast forward from that, "
1483.56,"from a lot of work from Dayu now on her own at NYU, "
1487.79,"and with her postdoc, Annegret Falkner, "
1491.84,"as well as work of other people, "
1493.55,there's evidence that the type of fighting 
1498.32,that we elicit when we stimulate VMH 
1501.77,is offensive aggression 
1504.41,that is actually rewarding to male mice. 
1507.8,"- They like it. - They like it, "
1509.3,male mice will learn to poke their nose 
1513.2,or press a bar to get the opportunity 
1516.35,to beat up a subordinate male mouse. 
1519.98,"And in more recent experiments, "
1522.23,if you activate those neurons 
1524.6,and the mouse has a chance to be 
1526.46,"in one of two compartments in a box, "
1529.07,they will gravitate towards the compartment 
1531.23,"where those neurons are activated, "
1533.42,it has a positive valance. 
1535.94,And when I went into this field 
1537.74,"and I was thinking, ""Well, what goes on in my brain "
1541.22,"and my body when I'm furious?"" "
1543.53,"it certainly doesn't feel like a rewarding experience, "
1547.46,it's not something that I would want to repeat 
1550.13,"because it feels good when I'm in that state, "
1552.62,it doesn't feel good at all when I'm in that state. 
1555.56,"And it is still, I think, a mystery "
1559.25,"as to where that type of aggression, "
1561.26,"which is more defensive aggression, "
1563.81,the kind of aggression you feel if you're being attacked 
1567.05,"or if you've been cheated by somebody, "
1569.99,"where that is encoded in the brain and how that works, "
1574.13,"still, I think, is a very important mystery "
1577.43,that we haven't solved. 
1578.93,"And predatory aggression there has been some progress on, "
1582.23,"so mice show predatory aggression, "
1584.51,"they use that to catch crickets that they eat, "
1587.21,and that involves different circuits 
1589.73,than the ventromedial hypothalamic circuits. 
1592.73,"So it's become clear that, if you want to call it "
1596.66,"the state of aggressiveness, is multifaceted, "
1601.82,it depends on the type of aggression 
1604.55,and it involves different sorts of circuits. 
1608.72,There's a paper suggesting 
1610.34,that there might be a final common pathway 
1614.72,"for all aggression in a region, "
1617.72,"which is one of my favorites, "
1619.19,"it's called the substantia innominata, "
1621.77,"the substance with no name, I like. "
1624.47,- Anatomists are so creative. - Yes. 
1626.525,"[Andrew laughing] Or the nucleus ambiguous, "
1628.7,"or the zona incerta, these are places "
1631.31,that no one can think of what they are. 
1633.11,"Anyhow, that might be a final common pathway "
1636.08,"for predatory aggression, "
1637.88,"and offensive and defensive aggression, "
1640.4,but it can be really hard to tell 
1642.59,just from looking at a mouse fight 
1645.47,whether it's engaged in offensive or defensive aggression. 
1649.64,We've tried to take that apart 
1651.47,"using machine learning analysis of behavior, "
1654.59,"but in rats, for example, "
1656.3,it's much clearer when the animal 
1658.7,is engaged in offensive versus defensive aggression. 
1661.82,They direct their bites 
1663.53,at different parts of the opponent's body. 
1666.02,- [Andrew] In particular. 
1667.43,"- Offensive aggression is flank directed, "
1671.21,"defensive aggression goes for the neck, "
1673.82,"goes for the throat. - Mm, "
1675.17,I've seen some nature specials 
1676.46,"where in a very barbaric way, "
1679.129,"[laughing] at least to me, it seems, "
1680.84,"like hyenas will try and go after the reproductive axis, "
1685.16,they'll go after testicles and penis 
1687.38,"and they basically want to, it seems they want to limit "
1690.95,"future breeding potential. - Yes, or create pain. "
1693.697,"[David laughing] - Right, or create pain, "
1694.85,or both. - Yeah. 
1695.72,"- Yeah, I mean, in terms of offensive aggression "
1698.81,"and your reflection that it doesn't feel good, "
1703.344,"I mean, I can say, I know some people "
1705.41,who really enjoy fighting. 
1707.15,- [David] Hmm. 
1708.08,"- I have a relative who's a lawyer, "
1709.49,he loves to argue and fight. 
1711.32,- [David] Huh. 
1712.16,"- I don't think of him as physically aggressive, "
1714.71,"in fact, he's not, "
1715.58,but loves to fight and loves to prosecute 
1718.58,and go after people. - Hmm. 
1719.84,- And he's pretty effective at it. 
1721.38,"- Right. - I have a friend, "
1722.27,"former military special operations, "
1724.49,"and very calm guy, had a great career "
1728.48,"in military special operations, "
1729.8,"and he'll quite plainly say, ""I love to fight."" "
1732.71,"- Mm-hmm. - ""It's one my great joys."" "
1734.39,He really enjoyed his work. 
1735.71,- [David] Yep. 
1736.97,- And also respected the other side 
1738.86,because they offered the opportunity to test that 
1741.83,and to experience that joy. 
1743.06,"So in a kind of bizarre way to somebody like me, "
1744.98,who I'll certainly defend my stance if I need to. 
1748.32,- Yeah. - But I certainly 
1750.02,don't consider myself somebody 
1751.1,"who offensively goes after people just to go after them, "
1753.8,"there's no, quote-unquote, dopamine hit here. "
1757.19,- Right. - Acknowledging that dopamine 
1758.21,"does many things, of course. "
1759.41,- Yeah. - I have couple of questions 
1761.3,"about the way you describe the circuitry, "
1764.0,"I should say, the way the circuitry is arranged. "
1765.8,- [David] Mm-hmm. 
1766.88,"- And of course, we don't know, "
1768.02,because we weren't consulted at the design phase. 
1771.436,[David laughing] But why do you think 
1773.93,there would be such a close positioning of neurons 
1776.87,that can elicit such divergent states and behaviors? 
1781.25,"I mean, you're talking about this pear-shaped structure, "
1783.53,where the neurons that generate fear 
1786.05,are cheek to jowl with the neurons 
1788.3,that generate offensive aggression of all things. 
1791.63,It's like putting the neurons that control swallowing 
1795.89,"next to the neurons that control vomiting, "
1798.23,"[laughing] it just seems to me that, "
1800.21,"on the one hand, this is the way "
1801.44,"that neural circuits are often arranged, "
1803.03,"and yet, to me, it's always been perplexing "
1804.59,as to why this would be the case. 
1806.27,"- Yeah, I think that is a very profound question, "
1810.17,and I've wondered about that a lot. 
1815.21,"If you think from an evolutionary perspective, "
1820.28,it might have been the case 
1822.44,that defensive behaviors and fear 
1826.34,"arose before offensive aggression, "
1831.53,"because animals, first and foremost, "
1833.81,have to defend themselves from predation by other animals. 
1838.16,And maybe it's only when they're comfortable 
1841.25,with having warded off predation 
1843.59,"and made themselves safe, "
1845.27,"that they can start to think about, "
1847.797,"""Who's going to be the alpha male in my group here?"" "
1851.84,And so it could be that if you think that brain regions 
1856.37,and cell populations evolve by duplication 
1860.21,"and modification of preexisting cell populations, "
1865.4,that might be the way that those regions 
1868.67,wound up next to each other. 
1871.58,"And developmentally, they start out "
1874.31,from a common pool of precursors 
1876.74,"that expresses the same gene, "
1878.54,"the fear neurons and the aggression neurons, "
1881.27,"and then with development, "
1882.56,it gets shut off in the aggression neurons 
1884.99,and maintained in the fear neurons. 
1887.63,"Now, that view says, ""Oh, it's an accident "
1890.99,"of evolution and development,"" "
1892.64,but I think there must be a functional part as well. 
1896.12,So one thing we know about offensive aggression 
1898.88,"is that strong fear shuts it down, "
1902.48,"whereas defensive aggression, at least in rats, "
1906.14,is actually enhanced by fear. 
1908.75,It's one of the big differences 
1910.46,between defensive aggression and offensive aggression. 
1914.27,"And if you think about it, "
1915.92,"if offensive aggression is rewarding and pleasurable, "
1919.25,"if you start to get really scared, "
1921.65,"that tends to take the fun out of it, "
1923.9,and maybe these two regions are close to each other 
1927.11,to facilitate inhibition of aggression by the fear neurons. 
1933.35,We know for a fact that if we deliberately stimulate 
1936.56,"those fear neurons at the top of the pear, "
1939.38,"when two animals are involved in a fight, "
1941.48,it just stops the fight dead in its tracks 
1944.3,and they go off into the corner and freeze. 
1947.03,"So at least hierarchically, it seems like fear "
1950.81,"is the dominant behavior over offensive aggression, "
1954.35,"and how that inhibition would work is not clear, "
1957.32,"'cause all these neurons are pretty much excitatory, "
1959.96,they're almost all glutamatergic. 
1961.91,"And so one of the interesting questions for the future is, "
1965.84,how exactly does fear dominate over 
1969.26,and shut down offensive aggression in the brain? 
1972.68,"How does that work, is it all circuitry, "
1974.75,are there chemicals involved? 
1976.52,What's the mechanism and when is it called into play? 
1980.3,But I think that's the way 
1982.28,I tend to think about why these neurons 
1984.29,are all mixed up together. 
1986.36,"And it's not just fight and freezing, "
1989.57,"or fight and flight, "
1990.5,there are also metabolic neurons that are mixed together 
1994.43,in VMH as well. - Mm-hmm. 
1996.08,Controlling body-wide metabolism? 
1998.36,- Yeah. 
1999.278,- Very interesting. - There are neurons there 
2000.25,"that respond to glucose, "
2001.75,"when glucose goes up in your bloodstream, they're activated, "
2005.77,"and VMH has a whole history in the field of obesity, "
2010.15,"because if you destroy it in a rat, you get a fat rat. "
2015.22,So the way most of the world thinks about VMH 
2018.15,"is they think about, ""Oh, that's the thing "
2020.26,"that keeps you from getting fat."" "
2022.12,"It's the anti-obesity area, "
2024.16,"but in the area of social behavior, "
2027.19,we see it as a center for control of aggression 
2030.7,and fear behaviors. 
2031.81,"And again, why these neurons and these functions, "
2036.4,"I like to call them the four Fs, "
2038.41,"feeding, freezing, fighting and mating. "
2040.926,- Mm-hmm. - That they all seem to be 
2041.95,"closely intermingled with each other, "
2044.05,maybe because crosstalk between them 
2046.48,is very important to help the animal's brain 
2049.54,decide what behavior to prioritize 
2052.84,and what behavior to shut down at any given moment. 
2057.19,- One of the things that we will do 
2058.42,is link to the incredible videos of these mice 
2062.38,"that have selective stimulation of neurons in the VMH, "
2066.443,Dayu's and the other studies that you've done. 
2069.67,"Whenever I teach, I show those videos at some point, "
2073.51,with the caveats and warnings that are required 
2076.57,when one is about to see a video of a mouse 
2080.83,"trying to mate with another mouse, "
2082.06,"or mating with another mouse, "
2083.41,and they seem both to be quite happy 
2085.15,"about the mating experience, "
2086.53,"at least as far as we know, as observers of mice. "
2090.19,"And then upon stimulation of those VMH neurons, "
2095.47,one of the mice essentially tries to kill the other mouse. 
2098.89,"And then when that stimulation is stopped, "
2102.76,they basically go back to hanging out. 
2104.65,They don't go right back to mating. 
2106.243,- Right. - There's some reconciliation 
2107.29,"clearly that needs to [laughing] happen first, "
2108.79,we assume. - Yes. 
2109.84,"- But it's just so striking, "
2110.797,and I think equally striking is the video 
2112.72,"where the mouse is alone in there with the glove, "
2116.77,the VMH neurons are stimulated 
2118.33,"and the mouse goes into a rage, "
2120.16,it looks like it wants to kill 
2121.09,"the glove, basically. - Yep. "
2122.98,"- So striking, I encourage people to go watch those, "
2125.53,because it really puts a tremendous amount of color 
2129.7,"on what we're describing, "
2130.84,"and it's just the idea that there are switches in the brain, "
2134.92,"to me, really became clear upon seeing that. "
2137.44,"One of the, excuse me, one of the concepts "
2140.26,that you've raised in your lectures before 
2143.14,and that I think was Hess's idea 
2145.3,is this idea of a sort of hydraulic pressure. 
2147.43,"- Mm-hmm. - Or maybe it was Konrad, "
2149.77,I can't speak now. 
2150.75,"[David laughing] Excuse me, Konrad Lorenz, "
2153.1,pardon. - Mm-hmm. 
2153.933,- Who talked about a kind of hydraulic pressure 
2155.68,towards behavior. 
2157.21,"I'm fascinated by this idea of hydraulic pressure, "
2160.15,"because I don't consider myself a hot-tempered person, "
2163.18,"but I am familiar with the fact that when I lose my temper, "
2166.39,it takes quite a while for me to simmer down. 
2169.69,"I can't think about anything else, "
2171.25,I don't want to think about anything else. 
2172.66,"In fact, trying to think about anything else "
2175.36,"becomes aversive to me, "
2177.37,"which, to me, underscores this notion of prioritization "
2181.93,of the different states. - Mm-hmm. 
2183.58,- And potentially conflicting states. 
2186.76,What do you think funnels into this idea 
2188.56,of hydraulic pressure toward a state? 
2191.17,"And why is it, perhaps, that sometimes we can be very angry, "
2196.12,"and if we succeed in winning an argument, "
2199.75,"all of a sudden, it will subside? "
2201.91,Because clearly that means 
2202.84,"that there are external influences, "
2204.31,"it's a complex space here that we're creating, "
2206.17,I realize I'm creating 
2207.003,a bit of a cloud. - Yeah. 
2207.836,"- And I'm doing it on purpose, because, to me, "
2209.86,"the idea of a hydraulic pressure towards a state, "
2211.78,"like sleep, there's a sleep pressure. "
2213.61,- Yeah. - There is a pressure 
2214.75,"towards aggression, that all makes sense, "
2216.43,but what's involved? 
2218.02,Is it too multifactorial 
2219.67,"to actually separate out the variables, "
2222.64,but what's really driving hydraulic pressure 
2226.51,toward a given state? 
2228.01,"- Yeah, so really important question, "
2231.94,"I think one way that is helpful, at least for me, "
2235.39,to break this question apart and think about it 
2238.39,"is to distinguish homeostatic behaviors, "
2242.92,"that is, need-based behaviors, "
2245.2,"where the pressure is built up because of a need, "
2249.4,"like, ""I'm hungry, I need to eat. "
2252.16,"I'm thirsty, I need to drink. "
2255.1,"I'm hot, I need to get to a cold place,"" "
2258.1,it's basically the thermostat model of your brain. 
2261.64,"You have a set point, "
2262.93,"and then if the temperature gets too hot, "
2264.76,"you turn on the AC, "
2266.08,"and if the temperature gets too cold, "
2267.91,you turn on the heater 
2268.87,and you put yourself back to the set point. 
2271.09,I don't think that's how aggression works. 
2273.73,"That is, it's not that we all go around, "
2276.76,"at least subjectively, "
2277.9,"I don't go around with an accumulating need to fight, "
2282.64,which I then look for an excuse to release it. 
2287.17,"Now, maybe there are people that do that, "
2288.667,and they go out and look for bar fights to get into to. 
2292.314,- Or Twitter. 
2293.36,"- Yeah, [laughing] or Twitter, "
2294.528,"yeah. - Twitter seems to, "
2295.361,"I'm sort of half joking, because Twitter seems to draw "
2298.27,a reasonably sized crowd of people 
2300.73,"that are there for combat of some sort, "
2304.42,even though the total intellectual power 
2306.4,of any of their comments is about that of a cap gun. 
2308.721,[David laughing] They seem to really like 
2309.76,"to fire off that cap gun. - Right, right. "
2312.52,- But I agree. - Yeah. 
2313.72,"- Before we continue with today's discussion, "
2315.46,I'd like to just briefly acknowledge 
2317.35,"our sponsor, Athletic Greens, now called AG"
1.,
2321.25,"Athletic Greens, aka AG"
"1,",
2323.5,"is an all-in-one, vitamin-mineral probiotic drink "
2325.99,that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes. 
2329.02,I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 
"2012,",
2331.75,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
2334.15,The reason I started taking Athletic Greens 
2335.8,and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day 
2338.74,is that it supplies total foundational coverage 
2341.65,of my vitamin-mineral needs 
2343.03,and it supplies important nutrients 
2345.55,that I need to support my gut microbiome. 
2347.53,"The gut microbiome, as many of you know, "
2349.27,"supports the immune system, "
2350.38,"it also supports the so-called gut-brain access, "
2352.39,"which is vital for mood, for energy levels, "
2354.76,for regulating focus 
2356.02,and many other features of our mental health 
2357.88,and physical health that impact our daily performance 
2360.19,and high performance in any endeavors 
2361.81,we might be involved in. 
2363.22,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
2364.6,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
2367.27,and claim a special offer. 
2368.86,They're giving away five free travel packs 
2370.54,plus a year's supply of vitamin D
3,K
2,with every order. 
2374.44,"And of course, vitamin D"
3,K
2,
2376.12,"are vital for all sorts of things, "
2377.8,"like hormone health and metabolic health, "
2379.57,and K
2,for cardiovascular health and calcium regulation. 
2382.36,"Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman "
2385.54,to claim that special offer. 
2386.86,- So you can think of this accumulated hydraulic pressure 
2392.14,either being based on something that you were deprived of 
2395.56,"creating an accumulating need, "
2397.93,or something that you want to do 
2400.54,"building up a drive or a pressure to do that, "
2404.92,"and the natural way to think about that, at least for me, "
2408.97,is as gradual increases in neural activity 
2413.5,in a particular region of the brain. 
2415.93,"And so for example, in the area of the hypothalamus "
2419.89,"that controls feeding, "
2421.39,Scott Sternson and others have shown 
2423.88,"that the hungrier you get, "
2426.22,the higher the level of activity 
2428.56,"in that region in the brain, "
2430.3,"and then when you eat, boom, "
2431.92,the activity goes right back down again. 
2434.56,"And that state is actually negatively valenced, "
2438.58,"so it's like the animal, quote-unquote, "
2441.79,"feels increasingly uncomfortable, "
2444.55,just like we feel increasingly uncomfortable 
2447.19,"the hungrier we are, "
2448.6,"and then when we eat, it tamps it down, "
2451.0,but there is this increased activity. 
2453.34,"And I think in the case of aggression, "
2455.47,our data and others show 
2457.09,that the more strongly you drive 
2460.39,"this region of the brain optogenetically, "
2463.63,the more of just a hair trigger you need 
2467.26,to set the animal off to get it to fight. 
2469.963,"Now, the interesting thing "
2471.73,"is that if there is nothing for the animal to attack, "
2475.78,it doesn't really do much 
2477.55,when you're stimulating this region. 
2479.65,"It sort of wanders around the cage a little bit more, "
2483.16,but it will not actually show overt attack 
2487.69,unless you put something in front of it. 
2489.64,And the same thing is true for the areas 
2491.53,we've described that control mating behavior. 
2494.47,"This is what Lindsay is working on, "
2496.39,"you can stimulate those areas 'til you're blue in the face, "
2499.99,"and the mouse just sort of wanders around, "
2502.18,"but if you put another mouse in, "
2504.49,"wham, he will try to mount that mouse, "
2506.8,if you put a kumquat in the cage. 
2508.992,[Andrew laughing] He'll try to mount 
2509.95,"the kumquat, "
2511.21,and so it becomes a sort of any port in the storm. 
2514.84,So there is this idea that the drive 
2518.53,is building up pressure 
2520.78,that somehow needs to be released 
2523.57,"where that pressure is actually being exerted, "
2527.65,if you accept that it's increased activity 
2530.26,"in some circuit or circuits someplace, "
2532.9,what is it pushing up against that needs something else 
2538.75,to sort of unplug it in the Lorenz hydraulic model? 
2542.86,"That is, you don't see the behavior "
2545.05,until you release a valve on this bucket 
2547.9,and let the accumulated pressure flow out. 
2551.41,And that's one of the things we're trying to study 
2553.93,"in the context of the mating behavior as well, "
2557.41,how does the information 
2559.24,that there's an object in front of you 
2561.52,come together with this drive state 
2564.04,that is generated by stimulating 
2566.32,"these neurons in the hypothalamus to say, "
2568.577,"""Okay, pull the trigger and go, "
2570.82,"it's time to mate, it's time to attack?"" "
2573.34,And we're just starting to get some insights into that now. 
2576.82,"- Fascinating, and I should mention to people, "
2579.7,"Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay, "
2580.99,Lindsay is a former graduate student of mine 
2582.61,that's now a postdoc in David's lab. 
2584.44,And I haven't caught up with her recently 
2586.33,"to hear about these experiments, "
2587.407,but they sound fascinating. 
2589.03,I would love to spend some time on this issue 
2591.64,"of why is it that a mouse won't attack nothing, "
2595.96,"but it'll attack even a glove, "
2598.45,and why it will only try and mate 
2602.02,if there's another mouse to mate with? 
2604.57,"It's actually, I think, fortunately for you, "
2608.29,you're not spending a lot of time 
2609.43,"on Twitter and Instagram or YouTube, "
2612.43,"but there's this whole online community that exists now, "
2615.4,"as far as I know, it's almost exclusively young males "
2619.84,"who are obsessed with this idea, "
2622.81,"I'll just say it, it has a name, it's called NoFap, "
2624.69,of no masturbation as a way to maintain their motivation 
2628.06,to go out and actually seek mates. 
2629.71,Because of the ready availability of online pornography. 
2633.733,- Huh. - There's probably 
2635.41,a much larger population of young males 
2637.3,that are never actually going out and seeking mates 
2639.16,"because they're getting porn addicted, et cetera. "
2641.71,There's actually a serious issue 
2643.03,that came up in our episode 
2644.59,"with Anna Lembke, who wrote the book "
2645.797,"""Dopamine Nation"". - Hmm. "
2647.38,"- Because of the availability of pornography, "
2649.39,there's a whole social context 
2651.64,"that's being created around this, and genuine addiction. "
2654.73,"So humans are not like the mice, "
2656.98,"or mice are not like the humans, "
2658.48,humans seem to resolve the issue on their own. 
2661.21,- Yeah. - In ways that might actually 
2662.5,impede seeking and finding of sexual partners 
2665.41,and/or long-term mates. 
2666.55,"- Right. - So serious issue there, "
2668.47,I raise it as a serious issue. 
2669.373,"- Yep. - That I hear a lot about, "
2670.497,'cause I get asked hundreds 
2672.34,"if not thousands of questions about this, "
2673.757,"""Is there any physiological basis "
2675.37,"for what they call NoFap?"" "
2676.87,And I never actually reply 'cause there's no data. 
2679.57,- [David] Yep. 
2680.53,- But what you're raising here 
2681.43,is a very interesting mechanistic scenario 
2686.05,"that can, and as you mentioned, is being explored. "
2689.5,So what do we know about the internal state of a mouse 
2694.63,whose VMH is being stimulated 
2697.0,or a mouse whose other brain region 
2700.66,"that can stimulate the desire to mate, "
2703.33,what do we know about the internal state of that mouse 
2705.61,if it's just alone in the cage wandering around? 
2707.62,iI it wandering around really wanting to mate 
2709.54,and really wanting to fight? 
2710.65,"We, of course, don't know, "
2713.11,"but is its heart rate up, "
2715.36,is its blood pressure up? 
2717.25,Is it wishing that there was pornography? 
2719.532,[David and Andrew laughing] 
2721.63,"Something's going on, presumably, "
2723.97,"that's different than prior to that stimulation, "
2728.98,and is it arousal? 
2731.23,And what do you think it is 
2732.55,about the visual factory perception of a conspecific 
2737.143,that ungates this tremendous repertoire of behaviors? 
2740.38,"- Right, that is a central question. "
2743.83,"I can say, at least with respect to the fear neurons "
2747.73,"that sit on top of the aggression neurons, "
2749.74,we know that when those neurons 
2751.51,"are activated optogenetically, "
2754.36,"in the same way we would activate the aggression neurons, "
2757.66,"that there's clearly an arousal process that's occurring, "
2761.29,you can see the pupils dilate in the animal. 
2764.32,There is an increase 
2765.79,"in stress hormone release into the bloodstream, "
2769.09,we've shown that heart rate goes up. 
2772.51,"So in addition to the drive to actually freeze, "
2777.28,"which is what those animals do, "
2779.65,there is autonomic arousal 
2782.35,and neuroendocrine activation of stress responses. 
2786.19,And some of that is probably shared 
2789.04,"by the aggression neurons and the mating neurons, "
2792.19,"although we haven't investigated it in as much detail, "
2795.43,but I wouldn't be surprised 
2797.14,because they project to many of the same regions 
2800.92,"that the fear neurons project to, "
2804.34,which is a interesting issue 
2806.47,"in the context to discuss later maybe, "
2808.81,in the context of why we're comfortable 
2811.15,with mental illnesses that are based 
2813.28,"on maladaptations of fear, but not mental illnesses "
2816.61,that are based on maladaptations of aggression 
2819.76,if they have pretty similar circuits in the brain. 
2822.49,But that's how I would imagine 
2825.61,"there is an arousal dimension, as you say, "
2828.82,"there are stress hormones that are activated, these regions, "
2832.15,VMH projects to about 
30,"different regions in the brain, "
2836.77,and it gets input from about 
30,different regions. 
2840.04,So I kind of see it as both an antenna 
2843.43,"and a broadcasting center, "
2845.17,it's like a satellite dish that takes in information 
2848.77,"from different sensory modalities, "
2851.29,"smell, maybe vision, mechanosensation, "
2856.03,and then it sort of synthesizes and integrates that 
2859.87,"into a fairly low-dimensional, "
2863.05,"as the computational people call it, "
2865.66,"representation of this pressure to attack, "
2868.81,and it broadcasts that all over the brain 
2871.78,to trigger all these systems 
2873.7,that have to be brought into play 
2875.77,if the animal is going to engage in aggression. 
2878.53,Because aggression is a very risky thing 
2881.35,"for an animal to engage in, "
2883.03,it could wind up losing 
2884.68,"and it could wind up getting killed, "
2886.75,and so its brain constantly has to make 
2890.29,a cost-benefit analysis of whether to continue on that path 
2894.43,or to back off as well. 
2896.41,And I think that part of this broadcasting function 
2899.59,of this region is engaging all these other brain domains 
2904.54,that play a role in this kind of cost-benefit analysis. 
2909.28,"- I want to talk more about mating behavior, "
2911.32,"but as a segue to that, "
2913.63,"as we're talking about aggression and mating behavior, "
2917.02,"I think, ""Hormones."" "
2918.4,And whenever there's an opportunity on this podcast 
2921.01,"to shatter a common myth, I grab it. "
2924.67,"One of the common myths that's out there, "
2926.968,"and I think that persists, "
2928.18,"is that testosterone makes animals and humans aggressive, "
2932.74,and estrogen makes animals placid and kind or emotional. 
2936.82,"And as we both know, "
2938.2,"nothing could be further from the truth, "
2939.94,although there's some truth to the idea 
2941.26,that these hormones are all involved. 
2943.84,Robert Sapolsky supplied some information to me 
2948.31,"when he came on this podcast, "
2949.72,"that if you give people exogenous testosterone, "
2952.6,it tends to make them more of the way they were before. 
2955.51,"If they were a jerk before, they'll become more of a jerk, "
2957.61,"if they were very altruistic, "
2958.93,they'll become more altruistic. 
2960.13,"And then eventually I pointed out, "
2961.547,"""You'll aromatize that testosterone into estrogen "
2963.82,"and you'll start getting opposite effects,"" "
2965.08,"so it's a murky space, it's not straightforward. "
2967.99,"But if I'm not mistaken, "
2970.75,"testosterone plays a role in generating aggression, "
2973.45,"however, the specific hormones "
2977.53,that are involved in generating aggression via VMH 
2981.91,are things other than testosterone. 
2984.28,Can you tell us a little bit more about that? 
2985.57,'Cause there's some interesting surprises in there. 
2987.7,"- Yeah, that's a really important question. "
2990.19,So when we finally identified the neurons in VMH 
2995.38,"that control aggression with a molecular marker, "
2998.8,we found out that that marker was the estrogen receptor. 
3002.64,"So that might strike you as a little strange, "
3005.07,why should aggression-promoting neurons in male mice 
3010.47,be labeled with the estrogen receptor? 
3013.5,Other labs have shown that the estrogen receptor 
3017.28,in adult male mice is necessary for aggression. 
3020.94,"If you knock out the gene in VMH, "
3023.52,they don't fight. 
3024.9,"And it's been shown, and a lot of this is work "
3027.36,"from your colleague, Nirao Shah, at Stanford, "
3029.88,"who is one of my former PhD students, "
3032.7,that if you castrate a mouse 
3035.58,"and it loses the ability to fight, "
3039.18,not only can you rescue fighting 
3041.79,"with a testosterone implant, "
3043.92,but you can rescue it with an estrogen implant. 
3046.74,So you can bypass completely the requirement 
3050.01,for testosterone to restore aggressiveness to the mice. 
3054.09,"And as you say, "
3054.923,"it's because many of the effects of testosterone, "
3059.01,"although not all, many of them are mediated "
3061.59,"by its conversion to estrogen, "
3064.59,"by a process called aromatization, "
3067.38,it's carried out by an enzyme called aromatase. 
3070.92,"In fact, most of your listeners "
3073.56,may have heard of aromatase 
3075.63,'cause aromatase inhibitors are widely used in female humans 
3080.52,as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. 
3083.55,They are a way of reducing the production of estrogen 
3088.8,by preventing testosterone 
3090.96,from being converted into estrogen. 
3093.12,"And in fact, there are a lot of animal experiments "
3095.34,"showing if you give males aromatase inhibitors, "
3098.88,"they stop fighting, "
3100.23,as well as also stop being sexually active. 
3104.88,"And so that's one of the counterintuitive ideas, "
3108.45,and Nirao has shown that progesterone 
3111.45,"also seems to play a role in aggression, "
3114.15,because these aggression neurons 
3115.68,also express the progesterone receptor. 
3118.62,So here are two hormones that are classically thought of 
3122.13,"as female reproductive hormones, "
3124.65,"this is what goes up and goes down during the estrous cycle, "
3128.1,"estrogen and progesterone, "
3130.05,"and yet, they're playing a very important role "
3133.29,"in controlling aggression in male mice, "
3137.16,and presumably in male humans as well. 
3139.95,"- Fascinating, so estrogen is doing many more things "
3144.72,than I think most people believe. 
3145.71,- Yep. - And testosterone is doing 
3148.2,"maybe different and fewer things in some cases, "
3150.87,and more in others. 
3153.54,I've known some aggressive females 
3155.91,"over the time I've been alive, "
3158.43,what's involved in female aggression 
3160.23,that's unique from the pathways 
3162.42,that generate male aggression? 
3164.43,"- Great question, "
3165.69,so we and other labs have studied this in both mice 
3170.58,and also in fruit flies. 
3172.47,So one thing in mice that distinguishes aggression 
3176.85,in females from males 
3178.08,is that male mice are pretty much ready to fight 
3180.6,"at the drop of a hat, "
3182.19,female mice only fight when they are nurturing 
3188.04,and nursing their pups 
3190.11,after they've delivered a litter. 
3191.76,And there is a window there 
3193.62,"where they become hyper-aggressive, "
3196.56,"and then after their pups are weened, "
3199.11,that aggressiveness goes away. 
3200.67,So this is pretty remarkable 
3203.16,that you take a virgin female mouse 
3205.92,"and expose it to a male, "
3207.57,and her response is to become sexually receptive 
3210.6,and to mate with him. 
3212.01,"And now you let her have her pups, "
3214.53,and you put the same male 
3216.33,"or another male mouse in the cage with her, "
3218.49,"and instead of trying to mate with him, she attacks him. "
3221.58,So there is some presumably hormonal 
3224.88,and also neuronal switch that's occurring in the brain 
3229.05,that switches the response of the female 
3232.08,from sex to aggression 
3234.99,when she goes from virginity to maternity. 
3237.6,"And we recently showed in a paper, "
3239.7,"this is work from one of my students, Mengyu Liu, "
3243.09,"that within VMH in females, "
3245.55,there are two clearly divisible subsets 
3249.93,"of estrogen receptor neurons, "
3252.6,and she showed that one of those subsets controls fighting 
3257.22,and the other one controls mating. 
3259.35,"And in fact, if you stimulate "
3261.09,"the fighting-specific subset in a virgin, "
3264.9,"you can get the virgin to attack, "
3267.12,"which is something that we were never able to do before, "
3271.2,"and if you stimulate the mating one, you enhance mating. "
3274.53,The reason we could never get these results 
3277.02,when we stimulated the whole population 
3279.93,of estrogen receptor neurons 
3281.52,is that these effects are opposite and they cancel out. 
3285.27,And so it turns out that if you measure the activity 
3289.08,of the fighting and the mating neurons 
3291.33,"going from a virgin to a maternal female, "
3295.2,the aggression neurons are very low in their activity 
3299.79,"in the virgin, "
3301.14,"but once the female has pups, "
3304.11,the activation ability of those neurons goes way up 
3308.76,and the mating neurons stay the same. 
3311.04,"So if you think of the balance between them like a seesaw, "
3314.67,"in the virgin, there is more activity "
3317.64,"in the mating neurons than in the fighting neurons, "
3320.4,"whereas in the nursing mother, "
3323.01,there's more activity or more activation 
3326.7,"the other way around, "
3327.63,the fighting neurons in the mating. 
3329.075,"- Mm-hmm. - Did I say, "
3329.908,"""Fighting and mating,"" the first? "
3331.2,"Mating neurons dominate fighting in the virgin, "
3333.9,fighting neurons dominate mating in the mother. 
3337.47,"So that's a really cool observation, "
3341.67,"and it's not something that happens in males, "
3344.16,and we don't know what causes that or controls that. 
3348.42,"Interestingly, this gets into the whole issue "
3352.62,"of neurons that are present in females, but not in males. "
3357.15,So the field has known for a long time 
3360.54,that male and female fruit flies have sex-specific neurons. 
3364.68,And most of the neurons that we've identified 
3367.35,in fruit flies that control fighting in males 
3370.38,"are male specific, "
3371.73,"they're not found in the female brain, "
3374.37,"but recently, we discovered a set "
3377.19,"of female-specific fighting neurons in the female brain, "
3381.57,together with a couple of other laboratories. 
3384.57,"Now, they do share one common population of neurons "
3388.86,"in both male and female flies, "
3391.2,"that in females, "
3392.61,"activates the female-specific fighting neurons, "
3395.34,"and in males, activates the male-specific fighting neurons, "
3398.88,so it's kind of a hierarchy with this common neuron on top. 
3402.69,"And in mice, we discovered "
3405.36,"that there are male-specific neurons in VMH, "
3409.71,and those neurons are activated during male aggression. 
3414.09,"Now, the neurons that are active in females "
3417.0,"when females fight in VMH are not sex specific, "
3420.99,so they are also found in males. 
3423.9,"So this is already showing you some complexity, "
3426.39,the male mouse VMH 
3428.73,has both male-specific aggression neurons 
3431.64,and generic aggression neurons. 
3433.86,"And then the female VMH, "
3435.66,"the mating cells are only found in females, "
3438.69,they are female specific 
3440.28,and not found in the male brain. 
3442.29,And so we're trying to find out 
3443.85,"what these sex-specific populations of neurons are doing, "
3447.27,but that indicates that that is some of the mechanism 
3450.72,by which different sexes show different behaviors. 
3454.14,- I'm fixated on this transition 
3456.9,from the virgin female mouse 
3458.37,"to the maternal female mouse, "
3459.837,"and I have a couple of questions about whether or not, "
3462.48,"for instance, the transition is governed "
3465.21,by the presence of pups. 
3466.41,"So for instance, if you take a virgin female, "
3468.03,"she'll mate with a male, "
3470.1,"once she's had pups, "
3471.3,"she'll try and fight that male, or presumably another "
3474.81,"intruder female, right? - Yes, "
3476.25,equally towards females and male intruders. 
3479.01,- Does that require the presence of her pups? 
3480.96,Meaning if you were to take those pups 
3482.37,"and give them to another mother, "
3484.05,does she revert to the more virgin-like behavior? 
3488.084,Is it triggered by lactation 
3489.15,or could it actually be triggered 
3490.95,by the mating behavior itself? 
3492.63,"'Cause it's possible for the virgin to become a non-virgin, "
3496.05,but not actually have a litter of pups. 
3498.21,"- Right, those are all great questions, "
3500.58,and we don't know the answer to most of them. 
3503.46,What I can say is that a nursing mother 
3507.36,doesn't have to have her pups with her in the cage 
3510.6,in order to attack an intruder male 
3513.63,"or an intruder female, "
3516.42,she is just in a state of brain 
3520.14,that makes her aggressive to any intruder. 
3523.38,And those aggression neurons in that female's brain 
3527.16,"are activated by both male and female intruders equally, "
3531.81,"whereas in male mice, the aggression neurons "
3534.87,"are only ever activated by males, not by females, "
3539.1,"because males are never supposed to attack females, "
3542.34,they're only supposed to mate with them. 
3544.56,So that's another difference 
3546.15,in how those neurons are tuned 
3548.58,to signals from different conspecifics. 
3551.55,Does it require lactation? 
3553.83,"I don't know the answer to that, "
3555.39,I think there are some experiments 
3557.28,"where people have tried to, classical experiments, "
3560.4,people have tried to reproduce the changes in hormones 
3564.51,that occur during pregnancy in female rats 
3568.02,to see if it can make them aggressive. 
3570.15,"And some of those manipulations do, to some extent, "
3573.81,but there's a whole biology there 
3576.09,that remains to be explored 
3578.25,"about how much of this is hormones, "
3580.65,"how much of this is circuitry and electricity, "
3583.83,and how much of it is other factors 
3586.56,that we haven't identified yet? 
3588.63,"- I don't want to anthropomorphize, "
3590.04,"but, well, I'll just ask the question. "
3592.86,"So the other day, I was watching ferrets mate, right? "
3597.574,"They're mustelids, and they're mating behavior, "
3600.57,"I guess I didn't say why I was watching this, "
3602.25,doesn't matter. [David laughing] 
3604.65,"It simply doesn't matter, "
3605.88,but if one observes the mating behaviors 
3608.43,"of different animals, "
3609.54,we know that there's a tremendous range 
3611.28,of mating behaviors in humans. 
3613.35,"There can be no aggressive component, "
3615.45,there could be an aggressive component 
3616.34,in humans that have all sorts of kinks 
3618.45,"and fetishes and behaviors, "
3619.77,and most of which probably has never been documented 
3621.72,'cause most of this happens in private. 
3623.67,"And here, I always say on this podcast, "
3624.96,"any time we're talking about sexual behavior in humans, "
3627.48,we're always making the presumption 
3628.74,"that it's consensual, age appropriate, "
3631.29,context appropriate and species appropriate. 
3633.42,"Well, today, we're talking about a lot of different species. "
3635.52,"With that said, just to set context, "
3638.94,"I was watching this video of ferrets mating, "
3641.88,and it's quite violent actually. 
3644.49,"There's a lot of neck biting, "
3645.93,there's a lot of squealing. 
3647.22,"If I were going to project and anthropomorphize, "
3649.38,"I'd say it's not really clear they both want to be there, "
3653.73,one would make that assumption. 
3654.84,"And of course, we don't know, we have no idea, "
3657.12,this could be the ritual. 
3660.33,"It seems, to me, that there is some crossover "
3662.76,of aggression and mating behavior circuitry 
3666.48,"during the act of the mating, "
3668.55,and do you think that reflects 
3671.04,this sort of stew of competing neurons 
3675.78,that are prioritizing in real time? 
3679.11,"Because, of course, as states, "
3681.57,"they have persistence, as you point out, "
3683.07,"and you can imagine that states overlapping, "
3685.32,"four different states, "
3686.25,"the motivational drive to mate, "
3687.75,"the motivational drive to get away from this experience, "
3690.33,"the motivational drive to eat at some point, "
3694.68,"to defecate at some point, "
3695.88,"all of these things are competing, "
3697.41,and what we're really seeing is a bias in probabilities. 
3701.28,"But when you look at mating behavior of various animals, "
3704.1,"you see an aggressive component sometimes, but not always. "
3707.76,"Is it species specific, is it context specific? "
3711.27,"And more generally, do you think that there "
3714.15,is crosstalk between these different neuronal populations 
3717.12,and the animal itself might be kind of confused 
3718.92,about what's going on? 
3719.94,"- Right, great questions. "
3722.25,I can't really speak to the issue 
3724.11,"of whether this is species specific, "
3726.45,'cause I'm not a naturalist or a zoologist. 
3729.18,"I've seen, like you have, "
3730.8,"in the wild, for example, lions when they mate, "
3733.98,"I've seen them in Africa, "
3735.12,there's often a biting component of that as well. 
3738.45,One of the things that surprised us 
3740.58,when we identified neurons in VMHvl 
3744.39,that control aggression in males 
3747.21,"is that within that population, "
3749.88,there is a subset of neurons 
3752.16,that is activated by females 
3754.8,during male-female mating encounters. 
3757.32,"Now, you don't generally think of mouse sex as rough sex, "
3763.35,but there is a lot of what superficially 
3768.0,"looks like violent behavior sometimes, "
3770.49,especially if the female rejects the male and runs away. 
3774.9,And there's some evidence 
3777.39,that those female-selective neurons in VMH 
3781.98,are part of the mating behavior. 
3786.45,"If you shut 'em down, "
3788.31,the animals don't mate as effectively 
3791.25,as they otherwise would. 
3793.23,What happens when you stimulate them we don't yet know 
3796.5,because we don't have a way to specifically do that 
3799.56,without activating the male aggression neurons. 
3802.8,But I think they must be there for a reason 
3806.4,because VMH is not traditionally the brain region 
3810.39,to which male sexual behavior has been assigned. 
3814.08,"That's another area called the medial preoptic area, "
3817.98,and there we have shown that there are neurons 
3821.07,that definitely stimulate mating behavior. 
3824.07,"In fact, if we activate those mating neurons in a male "
3827.61,"while it's in the middle of attacking another male, "
3830.73,"it will stop fighting, start singing to that male "
3834.45,and start to try to mount that male 
3836.97,until we shut those neurons off. 
3838.86,"So those are the make-love-not-war neurons, "
3842.22,"and VMH are the make-war-not-love neurons, "
3845.4,and there are dense interconnections 
3848.13,"between these two nuclei, "
3850.47,which are very close to each other in the brain. 
3853.86,And we've shown that some of those connections 
3856.32,"are mutually inhibitory, "
3858.66,to prevent the animal from attacking a mate 
3862.86,"that it's supposed to be mating with, "
3864.72,or to prevent it from mating with an animal 
3868.47,it's supposed to be attacking. 
3869.94,But it's also possible 
3871.59,that there are some cooperative interactions 
3874.65,"between those structures, "
3876.21,"as well as antagonistic interactions, "
3879.93,and the balance of whether it's the cooperative 
3882.87,or antagonistic interactions 
3885.09,that are firing at any given moment 
3887.49,"in a mating encounter, as you suggest, "
3890.34,may determine whether a moment of coital bliss 
3897.06,among two lions may suddenly turn into a snap 
3901.77,or a growl and a baring of fangs. 
3904.44,"We don't know that, "
3905.55,"but certainly the substrate, the wiring is there "
3909.42,for that to happen. 
3910.95,- I'm sure people's minds are running wild with all this. 
3914.07,I'll just use this as an opportunity 
3915.9,to raise something I've wondered about 
3918.18,"for far too long, [laughing] "
3919.83,"which is, I have a friend who's a psychiatrist "
3923.22,who works on the treatment of fetishes. 
3925.56,"This is not a psychiatrist that I was treated by, "
3927.66,I'll just point that out. [David laughing] 
3929.25,But they mentioned something 
3930.93,"very interesting to me long ago, "
3932.76,"which is that when you look at true fetishes, "
3936.15,"and what meets the criteria for fetish, "
3938.19,"that there does seem to be some, "
3941.04,what one would think would be competing circuitry 
3943.77,that suddenly becomes aligned. 
3946.95,"For instance, avoidance of feces, dead bodies, feet, "
3952.8,"things that are very infectious, "
3955.11,typically those states of disgust 
3957.93,"are antagonistic to the states of desire, "
3960.51,as one would hope is present during sexual behavior. 
3965.73,Fetishes often involve exactly those things 
3969.66,"that are aversive, feet, dead bodies, "
3975.06,"disgusting things to most people, "
3977.52,"and true fetishes, in the pathologic sense, "
3981.24,"exist when people have, basically, a requirement "
3984.84,for thinking about or even the presence 
3986.49,of those ordinarily disgusting things 
3989.52,in order to become sexually aroused. 
3991.17,- Hmm. - As if the circuitry 
3992.67,"has crossed over, and the statement that wrung in my mind "
3995.43,"was people don't develop fetishes to mailboxes, "
3999.51,"or to the color red, or to random objects and things, "
4004.25,they develop fetishes to things that are highly infectious 
4007.25,and counter-reproductive appetitive states. 
4010.213,"- Hmm. - So I find that interesting, "
4011.9,I don't know if you have any reflections on that 
4013.85,as to why that might be. 
4015.65,I'm tempted to ask whether or not 
4016.82,"you've ever observed fetish-like behavior in mice, "
4019.43,but I find it fascinating 
4021.41,that you have this area of the brain 
4022.91,"that's so highly concerned with the hypothalamus, "
4024.58,"in which you have these dense populations intermixed, "
4026.99,"and that the addition of a forebrain, especially in humans, "
4031.07,that can think and make decisions 
4032.84,could in some ways facilitate 
4035.27,"the expression of these primitive behaviors, "
4036.95,but could also complicate 
4038.51,the expression of primitive behaviors. 
4040.55,"- Right, I would agree. "
4042.68,I think one way of looking at fetishes 
4046.07,from a neurobiological standpoint 
4048.65,is that they represent a kind of appetitive conditioning 
4054.2,"where something that is natively aversive or disgusting, "
4059.39,"by being repeatedly paired with a rewarding experience, "
4064.82,"changes its valence, its sign "
4069.11,so that now it somehow produces the anticipation of reward 
4075.29,the next time a person sees it. 
4077.84,"Now, I don't know that literature in animals, "
4081.11,so I don't know if you could condition 
4083.84,"a mouse to eat feces, for example, "
4086.45,"although there are animals that are naturally coprophagic, "
4090.14,"and maybe mice do that occasionally, I'm not sure. "
4094.64,"But that is one way to think about it, "
4098.03,"and that could certainly involve in humans, "
4100.82,"the more recently evolved arts of the brain, "
4103.31,the cortex that is sort of orchestrating 
4107.33,both what behaviors are happening 
4109.85,and whether reward states are turning on 
4113.3,in association with those behaviors that are happening. 
4117.02,And that's the part that I think is difficult 
4121.19,"and challenging to study in a mouse, "
4124.31,"but certainly bears thinking about, "
4128.24,"because it's a really interesting, "
4130.79,"again, sort of counterintuitive aspect. "
4133.73,"Again, like rough sex, "
4134.96,"people that want to have fighting, "
4137.27,"or violence, or aggressiveness "
4138.92,"in order to be sexually aroused, and fetishes. "
4142.517,"And in fact, when we made that discovery initially, "
4145.94,it raised the question in my mind 
4148.01,"whether some people that are serial rapists, for example, "
4154.79,and engage in sexual violence 
4156.77,"might, in some level, have their wires crossed in some way, "
4161.15,that these states that are supposed to be 
4163.64,"pretty much separated and mutually antagonistic are not, "
4167.51,and are actually more rewarding and reinforcing. 
4171.47,I think it's going to be a long time 
4173.84,"before we have figured it out, "
4175.97,"but when you think about it, "
4177.77,there is no treatment 
4180.11,that we have for a violent sexual offender 
4184.07,"that eliminates the violence, "
4186.56,"but not the sexual desire and sexual urge, "
4190.58,"whether it's physical castration or chemical castration, "
4194.78,it eliminates both. 
4197.24,"- Definitely an area that I think, "
4199.16,"well, human neuroscience in general "
4200.81,"needs a lot of tools, right? "
4203.42,In terms of how to probe and manipulate neural circuitry. 
4206.78,"I'd love to turn to this area that you mentioned, "
4209.69,the medial preoptic area. 
4212.0,"I'm fascinated by it, because just as within the VMH, "
4214.817,you have these neurons for mating 
4216.47,"and fighting, or aggression, "
4219.11,my understanding is medial preoptic area 
4221.63,"contains neurons for mating, "
4224.06,but also for temperature regulation. 
4226.31,"And perhaps I'm making too much of a leap here, "
4228.44,"but I've always wondered about this phrase, ""In heat,"" "
4232.04,as certainly the menstrual and or estrous cycle in females 
4236.99,is related to changes in body temperature. 
4238.85,"In fact, measuring body temperature "
4240.11,is one way that women can fairly reliably 
4243.26,"predict ovulation, et cetera. "
4245.66,"Although this is not a show about contraception, "
4248.36,"please rely on multiple methods [laughing] as necessary, "
4250.52,don't use this discussion as your guide for contraception 
4254.27,based on temperature. 
4255.32,But if you stimulate certain neurons 
4258.17,"in the medial preoptic area, "
4259.31,you can trigger dramatic changes in body temperature 
4263.45,and/or mating behavior. 
4266.12,"What's the relationship, if any, "
4267.47,"between temperature and mating, "
4269.18,or do we simply not know? 
4271.61,- I don't know what the relationship 
4274.34,is between temperature and mating neurons 
4278.75,in the preoptic area. 
4280.94,I suspect that they are different populations of neurons 
4285.32,because it's become pretty clear that the preoptic area 
4289.79,has many different subsets of neurons 
4292.55,"that are specifically active during different behaviors, "
4296.15,even different phases of mating behavior. 
4298.76,"So there are mounting neurons, "
4300.53,"there are intromission thrusting neurons, "
4303.11,and ejaculation neurons and sniffing neurons. 
4306.02,"- Wait, wait, so I think I've heard this before, "
4308.63,but I just want to make sure that people get this 
4309.887,and I want to make sure I get this. 
4311.39,"So you're telling me within medial preoptic area, "
4315.53,"there are specific neurons that if you stimulate them, "
4317.78,will make males thrust as if they're mating? 
4320.75,"- No, so this is not based on stimulation experiments. "
4325.88,- Mm. - It's based on 
4326.713,"imaging experiments right now. - I see, I see. "
4328.91,- That we see when we look in the preoptic area 
4331.76,at what neurons are active 
4334.1,"during different phases of aggression, "
4337.22,we see that there are different neurons 
4339.26,"that are active during sniffing, mounting, "
4342.47,"thrusting and ejaculation, "
4344.87,and they become repeatedly activated 
4347.99,each time the animal goes through that cycle. 
4350.3,"- During mating, yeah. - During the mating cycle. "
4352.88,There are also some neurons there 
4354.38,"that are active during aggression, which are distinct, "
4357.35,and we don't know whether those neurons 
4359.66,are there to promote aggression 
4362.21,or to inhibit mating when animals are fighting. 
4366.23,"We have some evidence that suggest it may be the latter, "
4369.5,but we don't know for sure yet. 
4371.39,"The thermosensitive neurons are really interesting, "
4374.24,"because you mentioned the phrase, ""In heat,"" "
4377.45,"and then in the context of aggression, "
4379.79,"you talk about hotblooded people or hotheads, "
4382.91,there's just recently a paper 
4384.41,showing there are thermoregulatory neurons in VMH as well. 
4388.88,So all of these homeostatic systems 
4391.76,for metabolic control and temperature control 
4395.15,"are intermingled in these nuclei, "
4398.6,"these zones that control these basic survival behaviors, "
4402.86,like mating and aggression and predator defense. 
4406.85,And I would imagine that the thermal regulation 
4411.23,"is tightly connected to energy expenditure, "
4415.55,"and that, again, these neurons are mixed together "
4419.15,to facilitate integration of all these signals 
4423.02,by the brain in some way that we don't understand 
4426.59,to maintain the proper balance 
4428.48,between energy conservation and energy consumption 
4433.58,during this particular behavior or that behavior. 
4436.76,"I mean, I've always been fascinated by the question, "
4438.92,why is it that violence goes up in the summertime 
4443.0,when the temperatures are high? 
4444.83,Does it really have something to do 
4447.2,with the idea that increased temperature increases violence? 
4452.06,It seems hard to believe because we're homeothermic 
4455.33,and we pretty much stay around 
98.6,Fahrenheit. 
4460.58,"It could be other social reasons why that happens, "
4463.61,"people are outside, out on the street, "
4465.56,"bumping into each other, "
4467.03,but I think there could well be something 
4470.27,"that ties thermoregulation to aggressiveness, "
4473.99,as well as to mating behavior. 
4478.16,"- Fascinating, yeah. "
4479.81,I ask in the hopes that maybe in the years to come 
4483.35,your lab will parse some of the temperature relationships. 
4486.38,And I realize it could be also regulated 
4489.32,"by hormones in general, "
4490.43,so it's tapping into two systems 
4491.84,"for completely different reasons, "
4493.07,"but anyway, an area that intrigues me, "
4496.97,because of this notion of hotheadedness. 
4498.037,"- Right. - Or cool, calm and collected. "
4500.3,"And also the fact that, "
4502.517,"and I probably should've asked about this earlier, "
4504.35,that arousal itself is tethered 
4507.2,to the whole mating and reproductive process. 
4509.6,"I mean, without a sort of seesawing back "
4512.03,between the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
4515.15,"arousal, relaxed states, "
4517.31,there is no mating that will take place. 
4520.7,So it's fascinating the way 
4521.99,these different competing forces and seesaws operate. 
4525.74,"Several times during the discussion so far, "
4527.9,we've hit on this idea 
4530.6,"that the same behavior can reflect different states, "
4534.74,and different states can converge 
4536.45,on multiple behaviors as well. 
4539.33,"You had a paper not long ago about mounting behavior, "
4543.29,which I found fascinating. 
4545.51,"Maybe you could tell us about that result, "
4547.7,"because, to me, it really speaks "
4549.17,to the fact that mounting behavior 
4551.75,"can, in one context, be sexual, "
4553.85,"and in another context, actually be related to, "
4556.43,"we presume, dominance. "
4557.93,"And I think that my friends who practice jujitsu, "
4563.78,"when I talk about that result, "
4564.83,"they say, ""Of course, mounting the other person "
4567.05,"and dominating them, "
4568.82,"there's nothing sexual about it,"" "
4570.2,"it's about overtaking them physically, "
4572.39,"literally being on their neck side, "
4574.31,as opposed to lying on their own back. 
4577.55,- [David] Hmm. 
4578.383,"- Just fascinating, "
4579.29,very primitive. - Hmm. 
4580.123,"- And yet, I think speaks to this idea "
4583.07,that mounting behavior might be 
4584.69,one of the most fundamental ways 
4586.43,in which animals and perhaps even humans 
4588.8,express dominance and/or sexual interactions. 
4594.02,"- Yep, and that's a fascinating question, "
4597.5,and it was harder to figure out 
4599.84,than you might've thought. 
4601.22,"So there's been this debate for a long time in the field, "
4604.64,"when you see two male mice mounting each other, "
4608.69,"is this homosexual behavior, "
4610.85,"is this a case of mistaken sexual identification, "
4614.27,or is this dominance behavior? 
4616.4,And if you train an AI algorithm 
4619.52,to try to distinguish male-male mounting 
4623.78,"from male-female mounting, "
4625.34,"it does not do a very good job, "
4627.14,"because motorically, those behaviors look so similar. "
4631.43,And so how did we wind up figuring out 
4636.32,that most male-male mounting is dominance mounting? 
4640.91,"There are two important clues, "
4644.03,"one is the context, "
4646.82,and so male-male mounting 
4649.28,tends to be more prominent among mice 
4652.37,when they haven't had a lot of fighting experience. 
4655.58,"And then as they become more experienced in fighting, "
4660.41,they will show relatively less mounting 
4663.71,"towards the other male and more attack, "
4666.08,"and they'll transition quickly from mounting to attack, "
4670.13,and so the mounting is always seen 
4673.19,in this context of an overall aggressive interaction. 
4677.99,"And then the second thing, "
4679.4,"which, believe it or not, was suggested "
4681.38,"by a computational, theoretical person in my lab, "
4685.46,"Ann Kennedy, who now has her own lab at Northwestern. "
4689.15,"She said, ""Well, males are known to sing "
4692.48,"when they mount females, ultrasonic vocalizations, "
4695.6,why don't you see what kinds of songs they're singing 
4698.96,when they're mounting males? 
4700.28,"Maybe it's a different kind of song."" "
4701.78,"Well, what we found out is, "
4702.95,"they don't sing at all when they're mounting a male, "
4706.82,so you can easily distinguish 
4709.55,whether mounting behavior by a male mouse 
4713.6,"is reproductive or agonistic, aggressive, "
4717.71,according to whether it's accompanied 
4720.14,by ultrasonic vocalizations or not. 
4723.56,And it turns out that different brain regions 
4727.04,are maximally active 
4729.05,during these different types of mounting. 
4731.03,"So VMH, the aggression locus "
4735.08,"is actually active during dominance mounting, "
4738.35,"and you can stimulate mounting, dominance mounting, "
4742.31,"if you weakly activate VMH, "
4745.4,whereas MPOA is most strongly activated 
4748.82,"during sexual mounting, "
4750.77,and that's always accompanied 
4752.78,by the ultrasonic vocalization. 
4754.67,So this shows how difficult and dangerous it can be 
4758.48,"to try to infer an animal's state, or intent, or emotion, "
4763.37,from the behavior that it's exhibiting 
4765.86,because the same behavior can mean very different things 
4769.1,depending on the context of the interaction with the animal. 
4771.81,"- And I would say, even more so "
4773.84,with when that animal is a human or is multiple humans. 
4777.62,"- That's right, and there are many examples, "
4780.41,"animals show chasing to obtain food, "
4784.4,"a prey animal that they're going to kill and eat, "
4787.07,and they show chasing to obtain a mate 
4789.83,that they're going to have sex with. 
4791.57,"And so the intent of the chasing is completely different, "
4795.53,and we don't know in all these cases 
4797.36,whether there are separate circuits 
4799.49,or common circuits that are being activated. 
4802.67,- I'm obsessed with dogs and dog breeds 
4804.77,"and et cetera, et cetera, "
4806.09,and one thing I can tell you 
4808.7,is that female dogs will mount and thrust. 
4812.72,"We had a female pit bull mix, a very sweet dog, "
4817.01,"but in observing her, "
4819.807,it convinced me that one can never assume 
4822.83,that male dogs are more aggressive than female dogs. 
4826.4,"It turns out, in talking to people "
4827.447,"who are quite skilled at dog genetics and dog breeding, "
4831.26,that there's a dominance hierarchy within a litter 
4833.87,and it crosses over male-female delineations. 
4839.42,So you can get a female in the litter that's very dominant 
4841.79,"and a male that's very subordinate, "
4843.17,and no one really knows what relates to. 
4845.84,This is also why little dogs 
4846.98,sometimes will get right up in the face 
4848.87,of a big Doberman Pinscher. - Mm. 
4850.58,"- And just start barking, "
4851.413,"which is an idiotic thing for it to do, "
4853.04,but they can be dominant over a much larger dog. 
4856.16,"- Hmm. - Very strange, "
4857.66,to me anyway. 
4859.46,"Female-female mounting, do you observe it in mice? "
4863.09,"Are there known circuits, "
4864.62,"and what evokes female-female mounting, "
4867.23,or female-to-male mounting if it occurs? 
4870.41,"- Good, yes, there are clear examples of females "
4876.41,displaying male-type mounting behavior 
4879.02,towards other females. 
4880.52,We see this most commonly in the lab 
4883.91,"where we are housing females with their sisters, "
4887.39,"say three or four in a cage, "
4889.55,"we take one out and we have her mate with a male, "
4893.45,"where the male's doing the mounting, "
4895.22,now we take that female 
4897.02,and we put her back in the cage with her litter mates 
4899.93,and she starts mounting them. 
4902.423,"Now, what the function of that is, "
4905.93,"if it has any function, "
4907.7,"or what it means, what's driving it, we don't know, "
4911.12,but we do know that if we stimulate 
4915.601,the neurons that control mounting in males 
4918.23,"in the medial preoptic area, "
4919.76,"if we stimulate that same population in females, "
4923.72,it evokes male-type mounting 
4927.14,towards either a male or a female target. 
4929.66,"In fact, we have a movie "
4931.4,where we have a female 
4933.92,"that has just been mounted by a male, "
4936.53,"so the male's on top and she's underneath, "
4939.74,and we stimulate that region of MPOA in the female. 
4944.12,And she crawls out from underneath the male 
4947.39,"who has just mounted her, "
4949.07,circles around behind him 
4951.5,and climbs up on top of him 
4953.39,and starts to try to mount him and thrust at him. 
4956.51,"- That has a name online, it's called a switch. "
4959.127,[Andrew laughing] - Is that right? [laughing] 
4960.65,- [Andrew] Don't ask me how I know that. 
4961.76,- Okay. 
4962.84,"- But it's a pretty, yeah, it's a term that you hear. "
4968.09,"You also hear the term topping from the bottom, "
4970.67,which it sounds like that is a literal topping 
4972.44,from the bottom. - I see. 
4973.273,"- That's a more of a psychological phrase, "
4974.93,from what I hear. 
4975.77,"I have friends that are educating me in this language, "
4979.91,mostly because I find 
4981.29,this kind of neurobiological discussion fascinating. 
4984.727,"And at some point, right? "
4987.11,"I attempt, in my mind, to superimpose observations "
4989.93,from the online communities. 
4991.32,- Yeah. - That I'm told about 
4992.9,"and asked about to this, "
4994.46,"but I should point out, it's always dangerous, "
4997.01,"and in fact, inappropriate "
4998.24,to make a one-to-one link. - Yes. 
5000.73,"- Humans, they maintain all the same neural circuitry "
5003.61,"and pathways that we're talking about today in mice, "
5006.01,"but that forebrain does allow for context, et cetera. "
5010.21,- Yep. - Yeah. 
5011.043,"- So what the function is of female mounting, "
5016.42,"I don't know, it could be a type of dominance display. "
5019.54,It's hard to measure that 
5021.04,because people haven't worked 
5022.39,on female-dominance hierarchies 
5025.06,to the same extent that they've worked 
5026.71,"on male-dominance hierarchies, "
5029.05,but it indicates that the circuits for male-type mounting 
5034.06,"are there in females, "
5035.8,as early work from Catherine Dulac suggested some years ago. 
5040.24,"- Fascinating, fascinating. "
5041.68,"I love that paper because, as you pointed out for chase, "
5046.93,"for mounting behavior, we see it "
5048.61,"and we think one thing specifically, "
5051.4,"and after hearing this result, "
5052.78,"actually, I'm not a big fan of fight sports. "
5054.91,"I watch them occasionally 'cause friends are into them, "
5056.83,"but I've seen boxing matches, MMA matches, "
5061.3,"where at the end of a round, "
5063.1,"if someone felt that they dominated, "
5065.08,they will do the unsportsmanlike thing 
5067.78,of thrusting on the back of the other person 
5070.24,before they get off. - Really? 
5071.073,"- Almost like, ""I dominated you, and I'm,"" "
5072.97,"so mimicking sexual-like behavior, "
5075.04,"but there's no reason to think that it's sexual, "
5077.32,but they're sending a message. - Yeah. 
5078.46,- Of dominance is what it implies. 
5081.58,I'd love to talk about something 
5084.37,"slightly off from this circuitry, "
5086.2,"but I think that's related to the circuitry, "
5088.21,"at least in some way, "
5089.26,which is this structure that I've always been fascinated by 
5092.5,"and I can't figure out what the hell it's for, "
5095.082,"'cause it seems to be involved in everything, "
5096.07,"which is the PAG, the periaqueductal gray, "
5100.27,"which is a little bit further back in the brain, "
5101.77,for people that don't know. 
5103.33,"It's been studied in the context of pain, "
5105.01,it's been studied in the context 
5106.57,"of the so-called lordosis response, "
5108.49,the receptivity or arching of the back of the female 
5110.92,to receive intromission and mating from the male. 
5114.52,How should we think about PAG? 
5117.37,"Clearly, it can't be involved in everything, "
5119.56,I'm guessing it's at least as complex 
5121.6,as some of these other regions 
5122.59,"that we've been talking about, "
5123.55,"different types of neurons controlling different things, "
5125.38,but how does PAG play into this? 
5127.81,"In particular, I want to know, "
5129.94,is there some mechanism of pain modulation and control 
5133.48,during fighting and/or mating? 
5137.35,"And the reason I ask is that, "
5139.57,"while I'm not a combat sports person, "
5142.21,"years ago, I did a little bit of martial arts, "
5144.52,and it always was impressive to me 
5146.77,how little it hurt to get punched during a fight 
5149.29,"and how much it hurt afterwards, [laughing] right? "
5151.9,So there clearly is some endogenous pain control. 
5154.9,"- Yep. - That then wears off, "
5156.37,and then you feel beat up. 
5157.9,- [David] Yep. 
5158.733,"- Or at least, in my case, I felt beat up. "
5160.72,"What's PAG doing vis-a-vis pain, "
5164.17,and what's pain doing vis-a-vis these other behaviors? 
5166.27,"- Good, good. "
5167.44,So I think of PAG 
5170.11,"like a old-fashioned telephone switchboard, "
5173.95,"where there are calls coming in, "
5177.43,and then the cables have to be punched into the right hole 
5180.85,"to get the information, "
5182.38,"to be routed to the right recipient on the other end of it, "
5186.49,because pretty much every type of innate behavior 
5190.6,you can think of has had the PAG implicated. 
5194.047,And there's a whole literature 
5196.39,"showing the involvement of the PAG in fear, "
5199.36,"different regions of the PAG, "
5201.64,the dorsal PAG is involved 
5203.38,"in panic-like behavior, running away, "
5206.35,the ventral PAG is involved in freezing behavior. 
5210.91,"Both the MPOA and VMH send projections to the PAG, "
5216.46,to different regions of the PAG. 
5218.86,"So in cross-section, I hate to say this, "
5222.79,"but in cross-section, the PAG kind of looks like "
5225.58,the water in a toilet 
5226.93,when you're standing over an open toilet bowl. 
5229.75,- Mm-hmm. - And if you imagine 
5231.46,"a clock face projected onto that, "
5235.0,"it's like the PAG has sectors, "
5238.66,from one to 
"12,","maybe even more of them, "
5241.24,"and in each of those sectors, "
5242.89,you find different neurons 
5244.33,from the hypothalamus are projecting. 
5246.85,So could turn out that there is a topographic arrangement 
5251.17,along the dorsal-ventral axis of the PAG 
5254.17,and the medial-lateral axis of the PAG 
5256.99,that determines the type of behavior 
5259.84,that will be emitted when neurons 
5262.24,in that region are stimulated. 
5263.95,And I think sort of all of the evidence 
5266.02,"is pointing in that direction, "
5267.79,"but by no means, has it been mapped out. "
5270.52,"Now, the thing that you mentioned about it not hurting "
5274.0,"when you got beat up during martial arts, "
5276.88,there is a well-known phenomenon 
5279.22,"called fear-induced analgesia, "
5283.78,"where when an animal is in a high state of fear, "
5288.7,"like if it's trying to defend itself, "
5291.19,"there is a suppression of pain responses, "
5296.17,and I'm not sure completely about the mechanisms 
5300.64,"and how well that's understood, "
5302.68,"but for example, the adrenal gland has a peptide in it "
5308.74,"that is released from the adrenal medulla, "
5312.16,"which controls the fight-or-flight responses, "
5315.01,and that peptide has analgesic activities. 
5318.91,"Now, whether. - May I ask what that "
5319.743,peptide is? - It's called 
5320.576,bovine adrenal medullary peptide of 
22,amino acid residues. 
5325.45,And I only know about it 
5327.16,because it activates a receptor 
5329.47,that we discovered many years ago 
5331.54,"that's involved in pain, "
5333.22,"and we thought it promoted pain, "
5334.78,"but it turns out that this actually inhibits pain, "
5337.66,it's like an endogenous analgesic. 
5340.42,"Whether this is happening, this type of analgesia "
5345.37,is happening when an animal 
5347.38,is engaged in offensive aggression 
5350.17,"or in mating behavior, I don't know, "
5354.4,but it certainly is possible. 
5356.38,And I don't know whether these analgesic mechanisms 
5360.46,"are happening in the PAG, "
5362.44,they could also be happening a little further down 
5365.5,in the spinal cord. 
5366.55,"The PAG is really continuous with the spinal cord, "
5369.97,"if you just follow it down towards the tail of an animal, "
5373.87,you will wind up in the spinal cord. 
5378.291,And so it could be that there are influences acting 
5381.19,at many levels on pain in the PAG 
5383.98,and in the spinal cord as well. 
5386.32,"And it may well be known, I just don't know it, "
5389.05,I want to distinguish clearly between things 
5391.75,"that are not known, that I know are unknown, "
5395.05,"which is in a fairly small area where I have expertise, "
5398.74,"from things that may be known, "
5400.27,"but I'm ignorant of them, "
5401.77,because I just don't have a broad enough 
5403.51,knowledge base to know that. 
5404.51,"- Sure, we appreciate those delineations. "
5409.24,"Thank you, PAG, I think this description of it "
5411.67,"as an old-fashioned telephone switchboard, "
5414.04,"and now every time I look into the toilet, I'll think about "
5416.92,the periaqueductal gray. - [laughing] That's right. 
5418.15,- [Andrew] And every time I see an image 
5419.2,"of periaqueductal gray, "
5420.22,I'll think about a toilet. - That's right. [laughing] 
5421.053,"- That is an excellent description, "
5423.64,"because, in fact, I drew a circle "
5425.17,with a little thing at the bottom. 
5426.25,"And well, I'll put a post or link to a picture of PAG "
5430.24,"and you'll understand why David and I are chuckling here, "
5433.21,"because, indeed, it looks like a toilet, "
5435.37,when staring into a toilet. 
5438.28,"Tell us about tachykinin, "
5440.32,I've talked about this a couple times 
5441.64,on different podcast episodes 
5442.9,"because of its relationship to social isolation, "
5447.37,"and in part, because the podcast was launched "
5451.09,during a time when there was more social isolation. 
5454.63,"My understanding is that tachykinin, "
5456.79,"and you'll tell us what it is in a moment, "
5459.31,"is present in flies and mice and in humans, "
5461.8,and may do similar things in those species. 
5465.82,"- That's right, so tachykinin refers to a family "
5471.01,of related neuropeptides. 
5472.87,"So these are brain chemicals, "
5476.11,they're different from dopamine and serotonin 
5479.35,"in that they're not small, organic molecules, "
5483.04,they're actually short pieces of protein 
5485.83,that are directly encoded by genes 
5488.74,that are active in specific neurons 
5491.14,and not in others. 
5492.28,"And when those neurons are active, "
5494.05,those neuropeptides are released 
5496.27,"together with classical transmitters, "
5498.85,"like glutamate, whatever. "
5500.53,"Tachykinins have been famously implicated in pain, "
5505.48,"particularly Tachykinin-I, "
5507.91,"which is called Substance P, "
5510.34,"one of the original pain modulating, "
5513.31,this is something that promotes inflammatory pain. 
5517.45,"But there are other tachykinin genes, "
5519.97,"in mice, there are two, "
5521.62,"in humans, I think there are three, "
5523.93,"and in Drosophila, there's one. "
5526.36,And the way we got into tachykinins 
5529.21,is from studying aggression in flies. 
5532.51,"We thought, since neuropeptides "
5535.69,have this remarkable parallel evolutionary conservation 
5540.22,"of structure and function, "
5542.02,like Neuropeptide Y controls feeding 
5545.41,"in worms, in flies and mice and in people. "
5548.95,Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction 
5552.16,in worms and mice and in people. 
5555.55,We thought we might find peptides that control aggression 
5559.24,"in flies and in people, "
5560.71,"and so we did a screen, unbiased screen of peptides, "
5564.67,"and found, indeed, that one of the tachykinins, "
5568.737,"Drosophila tachykinin, those neurons when you activate them "
5572.98,"strongly promote aggression, "
5574.75,and it depends on the release of tachykinin. 
5577.51,"Now, the interesting thing is that, "
5579.37,"in flies, just like in people "
5581.98,and practically any other social animal 
5585.43,"that shows aggression, "
5586.9,social isolation increases aggressiveness. 
5590.38,So putting a violent prisoner in solitary confinement 
5594.88,"is absolutely the worst, most counterproductive thing "
5597.73,you could do to them. 
5599.02,"And indeed, we found in flies "
5601.36,that social isolation increases the level 
5604.66,"of tachykinin in the brain, "
5606.85,"and if we shut that gene down, "
5609.13,it prevents the isolation from increasing aggression. 
5612.61,"So since my lab also works on mice, "
5615.64,it was natural to see whether tachykinins 
5618.94,might be upregulated in social isolation 
5622.24,and whether they play a role in aggression. 
5624.58,And this is work done 
5625.63,"by a former postdoc, Moriel Zelikowsky, "
5628.03,"now at University of Salt Lake City in Utah, "
5630.85,"and she found, remarkably, "
5632.95,"that when mice are socially isolated for two weeks, "
5636.82,there is this massive upregulation 
5640.18,of Tachykinin-II in their brain. 
5643.39,"In fact, if you tag the peptide "
5646.27,with a green fluorescent protein 
5648.85,"from a jellyfish, genetically, "
5650.74,the brain looks green when the mice are socially isolated 
5654.91,'cause there's so much of this stuff released. 
5657.7,And she went on to show that that increase in tachykinin 
5664.06,is responsible for the effect of social isolation 
5667.78,to increase aggressiveness 
5669.79,and to increase fear 
5671.59,and to increase anxiety. 
5673.21,"And in fact, there are drugs "
5675.22,that block the receptor for tachykinin 
5678.13,which were tested in humans and abandoned 
5681.13,because they had no efficacy 
5683.05,in the tests that they were analyzed for. 
5685.54,"If you give those drugs to a socially isolated mouse, "
5689.71,it blocks all of the effects of social isolation. 
5693.37,"It blocks the aggression, "
5695.29,"it blocks the increased fear and the increased anxiety, "
5698.89,"and Moriel described it, ""The mice just look chill."" "
5702.49,"It's not a sedative, which is really important, "
5705.16,it's not that the mice are going to sleep. 
5708.19,"Most remarkably is, once you socially isolate a mouse "
5713.17,"and it becomes aggressive, "
5714.58,you can never put it back in its cage 
5717.76,with its brothers from its litter 
5719.62,"because it will kill them all overnight, "
5722.08,"but if you give it this drug, "
5724.36,"which is called osanetant, that blocks Tachykinin-II, "
5729.64,that mouse can be returned to the cage with its brothers 
5733.27,"and will not attack them, "
5734.77,and seems to be happy about that for the rest of the time. 
5738.67,"So this is an incredibly powerful effect of this drug, "
5742.51,and I've been really interested 
5744.76,"in trying to get pharmaceutical companies to test this drug, "
5749.26,"which has a really good safety profile in humans, "
5752.95,in testing it in people 
5755.38,who are subjected to social isolation stress 
5758.44,or bereavement stress. 
5760.57,And this is one of the areas 
5762.94,"where I learned an eye-opening lesson, "
5766.9,as a basic scientist who naively thought 
5769.66,that if you make a discovery 
5771.43,"and it has translational applications to humans, "
5775.18,that pharmaceutical companies 
5776.86,are going to be falling all over themselves to try it. 
5779.98,"And they are not interested, "
5782.11,"because once burned, twice shy, "
5785.56,these drugs were tested for efficacy in schizophrenia. 
5790.21,"I have no idea why, "
5792.22,there's very little preclinical data to suggest that. 
5795.31,"Not surprisingly, they failed. "
5799.517,When a drug fails in clinical trials in Phase 
"3,",
5802.48,it costs $
100,million to the company 
5807.61,that carried out that clinical trial. 
5809.32,"So there's a huge slag heap of discarded pharmaceuticals, "
5814.24,"many of them inhibitors of neuropeptide action, "
5818.29,"that could be useful in other indications, "
5822.22,"such as the one we discovered, "
5824.08,but there's a huge economic disincentive 
5827.5,"for pharmaceutical companies to test them again, "
5831.85,because the conclusion that they drew 
5834.31,"from all these failed tests, "
5836.14,particularly in the 
2010s,"and before that, "
5840.22,is that the reason they failed 
5842.74,is because animal experiments with drugs 
5846.55,"don't predict how humans will respond to the drugs, "
5851.2,"and therefore, we shouldn't try to extrapolate "
5855.1,"from any other data that we get from animal experiments, "
5858.76,"mouse or rat experiments to humans, "
5860.83,"because they'll lead us down the wrong track, "
5863.53,and I think that that is probably wrong. 
5865.96,"In some cases, it may be right, "
5868.24,"but in other cases, there's good reason to think, "
5871.18,because these brain regions and molecules 
5874.03,are so evolutionarily conserved 
5876.73,that they ought to be playing a similar role in humans. 
5880.51,"In fact, there is a paper showing that "
5884.68,"in humans that have borderline personality disorder, "
5889.81,there's a strong correlation 
5891.49,between their self-reported level of aggressiveness 
5895.51,"and serum levels of a tachykinin, "
5898.63,"in this case, Tachykinin-I, "
5900.67,as detected by radioimmunoassay. 
5902.86,"This is work of Emil Coccaro, "
5905.08,who's a clinical psychiatrist at the University of Chicago. 
5908.62,So there is a smoking gun in the case of humans as well. 
5913.21,And I was actually trying to interest 
5916.96,a pharmaceutical company 
5918.79,"that was testing these drugs, "
5921.7,"actually, for treatment of hot flashes "
5924.91,"in females, in humans, "
5926.86,where there is actually good animal data 
5929.86,"to think that it might be useful, "
5931.93,but I realized that this clinical trial 
5935.11,was going on during the COVID pandemic. 
5938.68,"And I approached him and said, "
5939.887,"""Look, nature may have actually done for you "
5942.82,"the experiment that I want you to do, "
5945.01,'cause some of the people 
5946.06,who are getting drug or placebo 
5948.1,are going to have been socially isolated 
5950.59,and some of them will have not. 
5952.09,Why don't you get them to fill out questionnaires 
5954.76,and see whether the ones 
5956.02,who were given the drug and socially isolated 
5958.87,felt less stressed and less anxious 
5961.51,"than the ones who were not socially isolated?"" "
5964.0,"And they would not touch it, "
5966.13,because they're in the middle of a clinical trial 
5969.28,"for a different indication for this drug, "
5971.77,and they have to report any observation 
5975.19,that they make about that drug 
5977.32,in their patient population. 
5978.97,So if they were to ask these questions 
5981.43,"and get an unfavorable answer, "
5983.927,"""Oh my God, I felt even worse "
5985.72,"when I took this drug and I was isolated,"" "
5987.97,they would be obliged to report that to the FDA 
5991.18,and that could torpedo the chances 
5993.16,for the drug being approved 
5994.81,in the thing that it was in clinical trials for. 
5996.88,So it's better not to ask and not to know 
6002.37,than it is to try to find out more information 
6005.16,that could lead to another clinical indication. 
6007.77,So I remain convinced that this family of drugs 
6012.66,could have very powerful uses 
6015.21,in treating some forms of stress-induced anxiety 
6019.53,"or aggressiveness in humans, "
6021.24,"but it's just very difficult, for economic reasons, "
6024.42,to find a way to get somebody to test that. 
6026.97,"- Yeah, a true shame that these companies won't do this, "
6030.48,and especially given the fact that many of these drugs exist 
6034.17,"and their safety profiles are established, "
6036.9,'cause that's always 
6037.89,a serious consideration. - Yep. 
6039.57,- When embarking on a clinical trial. 
6042.63,"Perhaps in hearing this discussion, "
6044.46,someone out there will understand 
6046.32,"the key importance of this and will reach out to us, "
6049.62,"we'll provide ways to do that, "
6052.29,to get such a study going in humans. 
6055.17,Because I think if enough laboratories 
6057.51,"ran small-scale clinical trials, "
6059.82,"pharma certainly would perk up their ears, right? "
6062.04,"I mean, they're so strategic. "
6064.05,- Yep. - Sometimes to their own. 
6065.64,"- I mean, I would like to say also, "
6067.56,I'd like to see this tested on pets. 
6070.32,"I mean, there's a huge number of pets right now "
6073.05,that are suffering separation anxiety 
6075.63,because humans bought them to keep them company 
6078.54,"during the COVID pandemic, "
6080.016,"and now they're home alone. - And now they're home alone, "
6081.729,yeah. - Okay? 
6082.562,"And if this thing works in mice, "
6084.54,there's certainly a higher chance 
6086.37,it's going to work in dogs or in cats 
6088.98,than it is going to work in humans. 
6090.75,"And if it did, that would be even more encouragement "
6093.72,to continue along those lines. 
6095.67,People sometimes forget that although we work on animals 
6099.18,"and we ultimately want to understand humans, "
6101.49,we care about how our results 
6103.68,"apply to the welfare of animals as well, "
6106.74,"and particularly domestic pets, "
6108.75,which is a multi-billion-dollar industry 
6111.96,in this country. 
6112.89,So if there is ways that they can be made to feel better 
6116.31,"when they're separated from their owners, "
6119.52,that would certainly be a good thing. 
6121.29,"- Absolutely, we will put out the call, "
6123.81,"we are putting out the call, "
6125.04,and I know for sure there will be a response. 
6130.5,"Just underscoring what we've been talking about even more, "
6133.41,"every time we hear about a school shooting, "
6136.71,"like in Texas recently, "
6138.03,or I happened to be in New York 
6139.65,during the time when there was a subway shooting. 
6143.01,"For whatever reason, I listened to the book about Columbine, "
6148.14,that went into a very detailed way 
6150.0,"about the origin of those boys that committed that, "
6153.27,"and every single time, "
6157.08,the person who commits those acts 
6159.18,"is socially isolated, "
6160.38,"as far as I know. - Yeah, yeah. "
6161.46,- There might be some exceptions there. 
6162.99,And sometimes this crosses over 
6164.31,"with other mental health issues, "
6165.45,"but sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues. "
6168.317,So social isolation clearly drives 
6171.24,"powerful neurochemical and neuro biological changes, "
6174.33,"I really hope that Tachykinin-I and II, "
6177.03,those are the main ones 
6177.96,"in humans? - Yeah, yeah. "
6178.83,- Will be explored in more detail. 
6181.41,"Also, I didn't know that Tachykinin-I is Substance P. "
6183.9,- Yes. - And Substance P 
6184.818,is Tachykinin-I. - Yes. 
6185.651,"Tachykinin-I is the gene name, "
6188.07,"and Tachykinin-II, in humans, is called Neurokinin B, "
6192.24,that's the name of the protein. 
6194.16,I just refer to it by the gene name 
6196.11,'cause it makes it easier 
6197.28,and I don't have to keep remembering 
6198.78,two names for each thing. 
6200.31,"- And if I'm not mistaken, "
6203.16,you put yourself in the company of geneticists 
6205.56,"because your original training was in genetics, "
6208.17,immunology and areas 
6210.0,"related to that. - It was in cell biology, "
6211.53,and I didn't actually have formal training in genetics 
6214.68,"as a graduate student, "
6215.88,"but I think I'm a geneticist at heart, "
6218.13,that's just the way I like to think about things. 
6221.25,"And when I started working on flies, that sort of, "
6224.82,"I came out of the closet as a geneticist, "
6226.92,as it were. [laughing] 
6228.18,"- Wonderful, as long as we're talking about humans, "
6230.85,I'd love to get your thoughts 
6231.75,about human studies of emotion. 
6233.16,"I know you wrote this book with Ralph Adolphs, "
6235.14,"you have this new book, which we'll provide a link to, "
6237.33,"which I've read front to back twice, it's phenomenal. "
6241.085,- Thank you. - I've mentioned it before 
6241.918,"on the podcast, it's really, "
6243.27,"there are books that are worth reading, "
6245.1,"and then there are books that are important, "
6246.6,and I think this book is truly important 
6248.19,"for the general population to read and understand, "
6250.77,"and neuroscientists should read and understand the contents, "
6253.2,"because we, as a culture, "
6257.01,are way off in terms of how we think about emotions 
6259.47,and states and behaviors. 
6261.3,"So we'll put a link to that, "
6262.44,"it's really worth the time and energy to read it, "
6265.83,"and it's written beautifully, "
6267.0,I should say. - Thank you. 
6267.833,- Very accessible even for non-scientists. 
6270.24,"There's a heat map diagram in that book that I think about, "
6275.55,this is a heat map diagram of subjective reports 
6278.61,"that people gave of where they experience an emotion, "
6283.71,"or a feeling, a somatic feeling, "
6285.66,"in their body, or in their head, or both, "
6288.48,"when they are angry, sad, calm, lonely, "
6292.35,"et cetera, et cetera. "
6293.79,And I wouldn't want people to think that those heat maps 
6296.46,"were generated by any physiological measurement, "
6300.87,because they were not. 
6301.83,"And yet, I don't think we can have a discussion "
6304.89,about emotions and states 
6306.84,and the sorts of behaviors that we're talking about today 
6309.15,without thinking about the body also. 
6311.01,- [David] Yep. 
6311.843,- And I'm not coming to this 
6312.84,"as a Northern California, mind-body. "
6314.99,- Yeah. - I've been to Esalen once. 
6316.344,"[David laughing] I didn't go in the baths, "
6317.4,"I went there, I gave a talk and I left. "
6318.96,It is very beautiful. 
6320.49,"If anyone wants to know what it looks like, "
6321.6,"I think that final scene of ""Mad Men"" is shot at Esalen, "
6325.65,it's a very beautiful place. 
6326.61,"And yet, mind-body, to me, is a neurobiological construct. "
6331.8,- Yes. - Because the nervous system 
6332.7,extends through out of the cranial vault 
6335.1,and into the spinal cord. - Yeah. 
6336.0,"- And body and back and forth, okay. "
6338.49,"How should we think about the body, in terms of states? "
6343.47,"And at some point, I'd love for you to comment "
6345.78,"on that heat map experiment, "
6347.58,because it does seem that there's some regularity 
6350.28,as to where people experience emotions. 
6352.86,"When people are in a rage, for instance, "
6354.57,"they seem to feel it both in their gut and in their head, "
6358.08,"it seems, on average. "
6360.57,And people love to extrapolate to gut intuition 
6365.28,"or that the chakras or anger is in the stomach, "
6368.73,"and this goes to Eastern medicine, et cetera. "
6371.76,How should we think about mind-body 
6373.92,"in the context of states, "
6375.0,"and think about it as scientists, "
6376.77,maybe even as neuroscientists or geneticists? 
6380.04,"- Good, so for the answer to the first question "
6383.67,about the heat maps 
6385.11,and people associating certain parts of their body 
6388.44,"with certain emotional feelings, "
6390.84,this goes back to something 
6393.15,"called the somatic marker hypothesis, "
6395.64,"that was proposed by Antonio Damasio, "
6398.28,"who is a neurologist at USC, "
6401.73,the idea that our subjective feeling 
6405.45,"of a particular emotion is, "
6408.09,"in part, associated with a sensation "
6413.34,"of something happening in a particular part of our body, "
6417.45,"the gut, the heart, "
6420.0,I don't see the liver 
6421.23,"invoked very much in emotional characterization, "
6426.66,but. - But gall 
6427.493,and the gallbladder. - Yes. 
6429.33,- Somebody having a lot of gall. 
6430.369,- That's right. - I don't know why I make 
6431.202,a fist when I say that. 
6432.035,- Right. - But I'm guessing 
6432.868,the gall bladder is shaped like a fist. 
6434.233,"[Andrew laughing] - That's right, "
6435.6,"and if there is a physiology underlying these heat maps, "
6440.25,it could reflect increased blood flow 
6442.8,to these different structures. 
6444.3,"And that, in turn, reflects what you were talking about, "
6448.05,"that is, emotion definitely involves "
6450.84,"communication between the brain and the body, "
6453.72,"and it's bidirectional communication, "
6456.84,"and it's mediated by the peripheral nervous system, "
6461.25,"the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, "
6464.49,"which control heart rate, for example, "
6467.43,"blood vessel, blood pressure. "
6470.19,And those neurons receive input from the hypothalamus 
6474.69,"and other brain regions, "
6476.88,central brain regions that control their activity. 
6480.33,"And when the brain is put in a particular state, "
6484.98,"it activates sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons, "
6488.97,"which have effects on the heart and on blood pressure, "
6493.74,"and these, in turn, feed back onto the brain "
6498.12,through the sensory system. 
6500.01,And a large part of this bidirectional communication 
6503.82,"is also mediated through the vagus nerve, "
6507.18,which many of your listeners and viewers 
6510.81,may have heard about 
6511.68,because it's become a topic of intense activity now. 
6515.67,"People have known for a long time, "
6518.16,so the vagus nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers 
6523.53,"that comes out basically of your skull, "
6527.25,"out of the central nervous system, "
6529.44,"and then sends fibers into your heart, your gut, "
6535.56,all sorts of visceral organs. 
6539.13,"And that information is both, "
6541.44,"you used the words earlier in our discussion, "
6544.71,afferent and efferent. 
6546.93,So the vagal fibers sense things 
6551.7,"that are happening in the body, "
6553.83,so the reason you feel your stomach 
6556.89,tied up in knots if you're tense 
6559.53,is that those vagal fibers 
6561.6,"are sensing the contraction of the gut muscles, "
6565.86,"and they're also afferents, "
6567.72,which means that information coming out of the brain 
6571.11,can influence those peripheral organs as well. 
6574.74,"And there's work from a number of labs, "
6577.08,"just in the last six months or so, "
6580.35,where people are starting to decode the components 
6584.82,of the different fibers in the vagus nerve. 
6588.24,"And it's amazing how much specificity is, "
6591.21,"there are specific vagal nerves that go to the lung, "
6595.32,"that control breathing responses, "
6597.57,"that go to the gut, that go to other organs. "
6601.59,"It's almost like a set of color-coded lines, "
6606.21,labeled lines for those things. 
6608.07,And now how those vagal afferents 
6611.97,play a role in the playing out of emotion states 
6616.56,is a fascinating question 
6618.27,that people are just beginning to scrape the surface of. 
6621.66,But I think what's exciting now 
6623.76,is that people are going to be developing tools 
6625.95,that will allow us to turn on or turn off 
6628.89,specific subsets of fibers within the vagus nerve 
6633.3,and ask how that affects particular emotional behaviors. 
6637.02,"So you're absolutely right, "
6638.64,"this brain-body connection is critical, "
6641.31,"not just for the gut, but for the heart, "
6643.98,"for the lungs, for all kinds of other parts of your body, "
6648.03,and Darwin recognized that as well. 
6650.52,"And I think it's a central feature of emotion state, "
6654.66,"and I think, what underlies "
6656.34,our subjective feelings of an emotion. 
6659.82,"- Incredible, well, David, I have to say, "
6662.52,as a true fan of the work 
6664.29,"that your lab has been doing over so many decades, "
6667.05,"and first of all, I was delighted "
6669.12,when you stopped working on stem cells. 
6670.712,[David laughing] Not because you weren't doing 
6671.55,"incredible work there, "
6672.54,but because I saw a talk 
6674.55,where you showed a movie of an octopus 
6678.42,"spitting out, or not spitting, "
6679.86,"but squirting out a bunch of ink and escaping, "
6682.32,and you said you were going to work 
6683.25,"on things of the sort that we're talking about today, "
6685.56,"fear, aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors. "
6689.07,"It's been incredible to see the work that your lab has done, "
6691.41,and I know I speak on behalf 
6695.632,of a tremendous number of people 
6697.08,when I say thank you for taking time 
6699.24,out of your important schedule 
6700.74,to share with us what you've learned. 
6702.69,"My last question is a simple one, "
6705.48,"which is, will you come back "
6707.16,and talk to us again in the future 
6708.87,about the additional work that's sure to come? 
6710.82,"- I would be happy to do that, "
6712.29,"and I really have appreciated your questions, "
6715.71,"they've all been right on the money, "
6717.45,"you've hit all of the critical, important issues "
6720.81,in this field. 
6721.86,"And you've uncovered what is known, "
6725.61,"the little bit is known, "
6726.81,"and how much is not known, "
6728.82,"and I think it's important to emphasize the unknown things, "
6733.11,because that's what the next generation of neuroscientists 
6736.74,has to solve. 
6738.09,And so I hope this will help 
6739.32,"to attract young people into this field, "
6742.47,"because it's so important, "
6744.27,particularly for our understanding of mental illness 
6747.6,"and mental health and psychiatry, "
6751.65,we've got to figure out how emotion systems 
6755.04,are controlled in a causal way 
6757.92,if we ever want to improve 
6759.87,"on the psychiatric treatments that we have now, "
6762.54,and that's going to require 
6763.89,the next generation of people coming into the field. 
6766.71,"- Absolutely, I second that. "
6768.81,"Well, thank you, it's been a delight. "
6770.34,"- Thank you, great, really appreciate it. "
6773.46,- Thank you for joining me today 
6774.6,for my discussion with Dr. David Anderson. 
6776.64,"Please also be sure to check out his new book, "
