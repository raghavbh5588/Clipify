0.179,welcome to the huberman lab guest Series
2.22,where I and an expert guest discuss
4.799,science and science-based tools for
6.66,everyday life
8.46,I'm Andrew huberman and I'm our
10.139,professor of neurobiology and
11.58,Ophthalmology at Stanford School of
13.38,Medicine today's episode is the third in
16.26,the sixth episode series on fitness
18.119,exercise and performance today's episode
20.82,is all about endurance and fat loss that
23.52,is the specific protocols required to
25.56,achieve the four different kinds of
27.119,endurance and how to maximize fat loss
29.939,Dr Andy Galpin great to be back
33.12,today we're going to talk about
34.26,endurance and I'm very interested in
36.3,this conversation because I like many
38.94,other people strive to get a certain
40.8,amount of cardiovascular work in each
43.32,week
44.64,maybe a long-ish jog maybe a swim ride
48.239,the bike Etc
50.039,but when I think about the word
51.18,endurance the idea that almost
53.52,immediately comes to mind is about doing
55.62,something for a long period of time
57.18,repeatedly but I have a feeling that
59.34,there are other ways to trigger this
61.44,adaptation that we call the endurance
62.879,adaptation so I'm excited to learn about
65.159,that I'm also excited to learn about the
67.14,fuel systems
68.46,in the body that allow for endurance and
71.76,other modes of repeated activity so in
74.82,order to kick things off I'd love for
76.08,you to frame the conversation by telling
78.42,us
79.26,what is endurance and are there indeed a
82.92,large variety of ways to induce what we
85.2,call this endurance adaptation sure the
88.2,way I want to start actually here is is
90.24,calling back to some of the things we
91.86,talked about our previous conversations
93.24,which are really people exercise for
96.06,three reasons number one you want to
97.86,feel better
99.0,number two you want to look a certain
101.159,way and then number three you want to be
102.299,able to do that for a long time right so
103.979,you need the way that we say it in
105.659,sports is look good feel good play good
107.22,right so I want some sort of
108.78,functionality to be able to perform a
110.399,certain way whatever that is for you you
112.5,want to be able to look a certain way
113.64,that whatever that matters for you and
114.84,then you want to be able to do that for
115.92,a long time so when it comes to
117.479,endurance we have a bunch of misnomers
119.1,here which is the same thing with the
121.02,strength training and resistance
122.22,exercise side where we wanted to dispel
124.14,this myth that
125.52,I lift weights only because I I want to
128.039,gain muscle or play a sport and I want
130.44,to do cardio because I want to leave
132.239,their loose fat or for long Health sake
135.06,and just like we smashed that myth from
137.34,the strength training side I want to
138.54,smash it from the endurance training
139.92,side there are so many other reasons
142.26,that you want to perform endurance
144.18,training
145.56,regardless of your goal right whether it
147.72,is longevity whether it is performance
149.459,or whether it is Aesthetics and so we're
150.959,gonna I want to cover all those reasons
153.42,uh exactly what to do Protocols of
156.42,course and why those things are working
158.22,that way in general though the quick
160.68,answer
161.7,is really endurance comes down to two
164.22,independent factors Factor number one is
167.4,fatigue management and then Factor
169.44,number two is fueling and that's all it
172.56,really comes down to so all the
173.94,different types of training are going to
176.099,reach a limitation which are either
177.66,again your ability to deal with some
180.54,sort of fatigue and that's generally a
182.34,fatigue signal the other one is
184.739,managing some sort of restriction of
186.66,energy input and a lot of the spoiler
189.42,here is a lot of the times people think
191.04,it's a fueling issue and really it's a
193.5,fatigue management issue or the opposite
195.72,and to have a complete Health Spectrum
198.78,regardless of whether you're a high
200.519,performance athlete like I typically
201.959,deal with or general public you need to
204.54,be able to do both manage fatigue as
206.879,well as understand fuel storage so
208.739,that's really what we're going to get
209.76,into today fantastic I can't wait before
212.64,we dive in I'm going to ask you what I
215.4,often ask people who are expert in their
217.8,respective fields which is is there any
221.659,non-obvious tool or mechanism or tool
226.799,end mechanism that can allow people to
229.5,access better endurance you know when I
231.84,think about training for endurance again
233.04,I think about trying to run longer and
235.68,longer each week yeah or Swim further
237.78,and further and so on but I do wonder
241.379,whether or not there are other forms of
242.76,training that can amplify the endurance
246.06,adaptation
247.44,that I or most people perhaps don't
250.14,think of as endurance sure the way I
252.78,want to answer this is if we look back
254.58,and think about how we've answered that
257.1,question with power and strength in
260.1,force production it is really about how
262.38,much can you produce
263.94,maximally once
265.979,what you're asking now is how can I
268.199,repeat that same quality of performance
271.44,if that's the case endurance really
274.199,comes down to your ability to maintain
276.18,proper mechanics
278.16,that's going like the biggest way we can
280.5,and increase your endurance
281.94,exponentially very quickly is mechanical
285.3,and this is starting with breathing and
287.759,so we need to be breathing properly we
289.32,need to have proper posture and
290.759,positions and then we need to be moving
292.259,well efficiency is going to Trump Force
296.28,always
297.54,for endurance
299.22,the other side of the equation is not
300.9,that you can have a little bit of leaks
302.88,in your mechanics and still squat well
304.919,or jump high and be fine because you
307.199,don't have to suffer those consequences
308.82,repeatedly right that's going to drain
311.16,you over time so the quickest way to
313.38,improve endurance is to improve
315.0,mechanics and the mechanical thing I
316.8,would go after first is your breathing
318.18,techniques your pattern your entire
319.8,approach as well as your posture and
322.38,then from there the third one would be
323.639,your movement technique is it possible
325.68,to describe the best way to breathe when
328.199,doing an endurance training or is it far
329.88,more complex than that and if it is far
331.38,more complex than that then certainly we
333.12,can get into it during today's episode
334.68,yeah it is both of those I will give you
336.96,a quick answer though a lot of the times
338.639,you can
340.08,kind of Hit the cheat code which is
341.639,nasal breathing there's plenty of times
343.86,when you don't want to nasal breathe you
345.24,don't need your nasal breathe but just
347.22,again is that like a one tool that is a
349.62,for a pretty General answer if you can
352.02,do that a lot of the times that will fix
354.419,breathing mechanics just by default and
356.52,we can maybe talk about why that is
358.02,later but that would be my sort of one
360.24,sentence bullet point answer immediately
361.86,of how to get in the right positions the
364.02,second one would be simply looking at
366.06,your posture right so whether you're on
368.22,a bike or you're doing a lift or you're
370.8,running if you're literally uh hunched
373.139,over and your ribs are touching your
375.06,femur or getting closer and closer like
377.52,tends to happen on a bike or an air
380.28,assault thing for somebody I've seen
382.02,recently this morning I was on the
384.24,assault bike um doing a Sprint and I
387.539,asked Andy Dr Galpin to critique my form
391.08,and anything else he wanted to critique
393.0,so that I could improve and he did
394.979,comment on my rather c-shaped posture
397.319,correct um encouraging me to be more
399.24,upright which I should probably do now
400.86,as well and he also cued me to the fact
403.319,that during a one minute Sprint there is
405.18,something that is quote unquote magic
406.919,that happens right about the 42nd Mark
408.72,and I use that as a
411.24,um as a milestone uh to look for and
413.58,indeed something does happen at the 42nd
416.16,it's into a one minute Sprint where all
418.139,of a sudden it it does seem to get much
420.72,easier for reasons I don't understand
422.34,maybe you can to tell it that but it
423.9,certainly had nothing to do with my
424.86,posture my posture needs Improvement
426.3,thank you well yeah so
428.46,um breathing mechanics and breathing
430.139,strategies uh people tend to be over
432.419,breathing early on and this is going to
435.0,lead to problems later so having a more
437.639,strategic breathing pattern and approach
440.699,is again a very quick solution I know
443.16,that we're going to dive very deep into
445.139,the mechanisms of Energy and Metabolism
448.16,and endurance today but as long as we're
451.86,having a discussion about these um
453.78,briefs or tidbits of how to improve
456.72,endurance are there any other ways to
458.819,improve endurance that that are of
461.22,relatively short time investment even if
463.68,they require a lot of um energy
466.68,sure the classic Paradigm you're going
469.139,to find here is steady state long
471.24,duration
472.5,posed up against what a lot of folks
474.24,will now call higher intensity interval
476.699,training specifically and there's a lot
478.979,of misconceptions here the quick answer
480.66,is you need to be doing both and there's
482.22,probably a bunch of stuff in between
483.419,that you should be practicing if you
485.4,honestly want to maximize those three
486.9,factories we talked about at the
488.16,beginning you need to be training across
489.96,this full spectrum just like I told you
491.94,to train across the full spectrum of
493.44,your lifting we want to be doing the
495.06,same thing here so are there independent
497.4,special factors that can happen with the
500.16,shorter time length higher intensity
502.259,stuff absolutely there's also magic that
504.599,happens on the other end of that
505.74,Spectrum so it's very important that
508.08,people don't just choose one side
509.52,because what tends to happen is people
511.139,either go with the oh I'm going to do 30
513.06,or 45 minutes of steady state stuff
515.88,that's it or I'm gonna do the opposite
518.459,which I'm going to leave that stuff on
519.659,the table not do it because I only want
521.64,to do high intensity intervals because I
523.02,can get it done in five minutes so
524.52,there's Magic on both sides of the
526.2,equation we want to get into all that
527.88,but just to answer your question
529.32,directly
530.459,there's a whole bunch of of things you
532.38,can do
533.7,um in under one minute that are
535.8,convenient to do and there's a wonderful
537.959,set of papers out of a couple
539.94,Laboratories in Canada that that
541.86,championed this idea that's called
543.12,exercise snacks so there's a bunch of
545.279,there's a series of studies that have
546.36,been done here that are really
547.14,interesting and they've looked at a
548.94,couple of things that are noteworthy one
550.5,of them is a 20-second bout of all out
553.92,work and this is actually done in
555.66,workers in an office and so what they
557.519,have them do is run upstairs and I
559.68,believe it was about 60 steps is what it
562.38,took them something along the order of
563.94,20 seconds exactly and they repeated
565.92,that about once every four hours
568.68,so really it's you go to work you get
570.54,you know put your coffee and your bag
571.92,down whatever you run up a flight of
573.66,stairs 20 seconds later then you go
575.22,right back to work at lunch and before
576.899,you go home you sort of repeat it there
578.339,and if you repeat that that's multiple
580.8,times a week you're going to do that I
582.12,think they in one of the interventions
583.8,it was three times a week
585.36,for six weeks 18 total times you did
588.48,that
589.26,and what you'll see is a noticeable
591.959,Improvement this is statistically
593.22,significant improvements in
594.36,cardiorespiratory Fitness specifically
596.16,VO2 max as well as a number of cognitive
599.22,benefits work productivity
601.2,Etc that can happen in as little as 20
603.54,seconds you don't have to go to the gym
605.04,you don't have to shower you don't have
606.899,to do anything like that just find the
608.64,stairs run up and down them a few times
611.04,now you may have noticed um you actually
613.08,sort of caught me yesterday I did that
615.54,right here right I was just I we had a
617.88,little bit of a break I was feeling an
619.98,energy lull I ran up the stairs three or
622.14,four times felt a lot better so that can
625.38,actually also help they ran another
626.7,study where they looked at that
628.5,following a giant high glycemic index
630.899,meal and what they saw and then they
633.12,took insulin measures and a whole bunch
635.339,of
636.24,um other biological markers Associated
638.64,that you want to pay attention to the
640.68,high glycemic index meal and they looked
642.6,at those immediately an hour three hours
644.64,six hours as opposed and it was very
646.68,clear that same intervention was able to
649.2,improve post-planned yell glucose
651.12,control insulin and a whole bunch of
653.279,other factors in addition to that so if
655.92,you are the sort of type who's like wow
657.839,I'm in an office all day maybe also had
660.72,a giant high glycemic index meal not the
664.62,best approach but a little bit of
666.12,mitigation there can just be running up
668.339,a flight of stairs or doing something
669.72,like that for as little as 20 seconds so
671.88,there's a lot of magic and power and
674.339,maximal exertion
675.839,if one does not have access to a flight
678.54,of stairs at work could they do jumping
681.6,jacks absolutely I mean you could do
683.579,anything you really wanted it's not the
685.98,mode of exercise that matters here it is
688.92,simply the exertion you just get up as
691.8,hard as you can you could do burpees you
693.54,could do any number of things you could
695.82,Sprint down your road down the hallway
697.8,back and forth the mode is is just uh
702.66,something that was easy for the
704.459,scientists to control and X number of
707.399,steps people could do it you're not
708.779,going to fall hurt yourself things like
710.399,that just to remind me it's once every
712.98,four hours one minute of all 20 seconds
715.98,oh 20 seconds excuse me uh 20 seconds of
718.8,essentially all out exertion yep while
721.2,remaining safe not going so fast up the
723.24,stairs or doing jumping jacks certainly
724.92,not down the stairs
726.12,up the stairs please
728.1,um escalators don't count well I suppose
730.8,they count if they're uh you know if
732.6,you're if you're moving uh if you're not
734.82,remaining on the same steps
736.86,um in fact in an airport recently I saw
739.44,somebody walking against the oh there
742.2,you go the conveyor yeah while talking
743.82,on the phone while waiting for their
745.32,flight to take off and I thought it's
746.76,genius right it looked a little awkward
748.26,who cares yeah but it was I have looked
750.779,awkward in every airport I've been in
752.399,for the last 15 years for those exact
754.44,reasons doing wild stuff like that yeah
756.54,well nothing's more Awkward than not
758.399,being able to walk to the end of the
759.66,terminal simply because one isn't
761.579,familiar with walking that far carrying
763.5,a couple of suitcases there you go yeah
765.18,that's the the other fit test the
767.639,suitcase carrier yeah I'm in the airport
769.5,I love this so once every four hours 20
771.779,seconds so maybe once when arriving to
773.88,work once four hours in and then four
776.88,hours most people probably work
778.38,somewhere you know eight plus or minus
780.3,two hours now one thing I actually
781.98,really want to make clear because your
783.899,audience is so incredible
785.82,um
786.48,they tend to be really excited about
788.519,these protocols and they follow them
789.899,exactly as written that's not exactly
792.24,how science works so it doesn't
794.22,necessarily have to be every four hours
796.26,it's in half three three times a day it
797.82,doesn't have to be 20 seconds they
799.98,literally built that protocol because it
801.839,was so they're trying to replicate a
803.459,real life scenario maybe you're in an
805.079,office building you're generally there
806.639,for eight hours Let's see if you did one
808.38,every sort of so if you want to do it
810.6,four times a week great if you can do it
812.1,only 10 seconds amazing you're probably
814.5,going to get the same benefits those are
816.24,not the details to pay attention to the
817.86,detail to pay attention to is every so
820.139,often multiple times a day
822.6,try to get your heart rate up really
824.1,quickly it doesn't require sweating
825.779,doesn't require anything else there's no
827.04,warm-up associated with it again you
829.8,need a minute break in between meetings
831.6,or whatever and you can Sprint up them I
833.22,do this all the time in my house when
835.44,you you know have those days when you're
836.7,on like seven straight hours of zooms
838.86,Etc you can get out of 20 seconds I run
841.62,to my garage which is over there I hop
843.42,on the the airbike and I will just smash
845.279,out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then
847.44,walk right back in
848.7,love it yeah
850.56,I'm gonna start yeah just also you can
853.5,just put one of those things which I do
854.94,also just put one in your office
857.04,and hop over right over there you know
858.839,the whole entire thing now literally
860.16,takes 23 seconds before we begin I'd
862.62,like to emphasize that this podcast is
864.24,separate from my teaching and research
865.56,roles at Stanford it is also separate
867.48,from Dr Andy galpin's teaching and
868.98,research roles at Cal State Fullerton it
871.2,is however part of our desire and effort
872.94,to bring zero cost to Consumer
874.26,information about science and science
875.7,related tools to the general public in
877.98,keeping with that theme we'd like to
879.42,thank the sponsors of today's podcast
880.98,our first sponsor is momentous momentous
884.04,makes supplements of the absolute
885.6,highest quality the huberman Lab podcast
887.88,is proud to be partnering with momentous
889.86,for several important reasons first of
891.839,all as I mentioned their supplements are
893.339,of extremely high quality second of all
895.26,their supplements are generally in
897.54,single ingredient formulations if you're
899.579,going to develop a supplementation
900.839,protocol you're going to want to focus
902.76,mainly on using single ingredient
904.199,formulations with single ingredient
905.94,formulations you can devise the most
908.279,logical and effective and cost-effective
910.5,supplementation regimen for your goals
912.66,in addition momentous supplement ship
914.399,internationally and this is of course
916.019,important because we realize that many
917.519,of the huberman Lab podcast listeners
919.019,reside outside the United States if
921.3,you'd like to try the various
922.26,supplements mentioned on the huberman
923.519,Lab podcast in particular supplements
925.74,for Hormone Health for Sleep
927.36,optimization for Focus as well as a
929.579,number of other things including
930.6,exercise recovery you can go to live
932.579,momentous spelled ous so that's
934.32,livemomentis.com huberman today's
936.839,episode is also brought To Us by levels
938.76,levels is a program that lets you see
940.62,how different foods and activities
942.18,affect your health by giving you
943.74,real-time feedback on your blood glucose
945.72,using a continuous glucose monitor many
948.18,people are aware that their blood sugar
949.98,that is their blood glucose level is
952.139,critical for everything from Fat Loss to
955.38,muscle gain to healthy cognition and
957.899,indeed aging of the brain and body most
960.839,people do not know however how different
962.639,foods and different activities including
964.92,exercise or different temperature
967.079,environments impact their blood glucose
969.18,levels and yet blood glucose is
970.68,exquisitely sensitive to all of those
972.66,things I first started using levels
974.82,about a year ago as a way to understand
976.92,and how different foods exercise and
979.38,timing of food relative to exercise and
981.54,quality of sleep at night impact my
983.339,blood glucose levels and I've learned a
985.139,tremendous amount from using levels it's
987.959,taught me when best to eat what best to
990.48,eat when best to exercise how best to
993.0,exercise and how to modulate my entire
995.76,schedule from work to exercise and even
998.519,my sleep so if you're interested in
1000.199,learning more about levels and trying a
1001.94,continuous glucose monitor yourself go
1003.98,to levels.link huberman that's levels
1006.86,dot link slash huberman today's episode
1009.199,is also brought To Us by element element
1011.24,is an electrolyte drink that contains
1012.98,the exact ratios of the electrolyte
1014.72,sodium magnesium and potassium to
1016.94,optimize cellular functioning for mental
1018.68,and physical performance most people
1020.3,realize that hydration is key we need to
1022.459,ingest enough fluids in order to feel
1024.5,our best and perform our best but what
1026.66,most people do not realize is that the
1029.12,proper functioning of our cells and
1030.74,nerve cells neurons in particular
1032.299,requires that sodium magnesium and
1034.699,potassium be present in the correct
1036.62,ratio goes now of course people with
1039.14,pre-hypertension and hypertension need
1040.88,to be careful about their sodium intake
1042.5,but what a lot of people don't realize
1044.059,is that if you drink caffeine if you
1046.699,exercise and in particular if you're
1048.319,following a very clean diet that is not
1050.66,a lot of processed foods which of course

1082.4,tell me about endurance what is
1083.96,endurance how do I get more endurance
1086.559,and how does it work
1088.94,when we think about endurance I would
1090.679,like to open up the conversation to
1092.12,include more things than people
1093.98,generally do when they hear the word
1095.96,endurance so if we just think about what
1098.24,you typically ask your body to do or
1100.88,would like to ask your body to do and we
1103.039,just walk through them
1104.539,it's going to be things like this number
1105.919,one I want to have energy throughout the
1107.419,day that's actually a form of endurance
1110.36,great I don't want to have these lulls
1112.22,and fatigue and I want to feel fantastic
1113.84,as I move throughout my activities of
1115.64,daily living whatever those may be work
1117.86,exercise
1119.96,enjoyment paying attention focus all
1122.66,that stuff great that's one thing
1124.52,another thing you want to ask your body
1126.32,to do is I want to be able to repeat
1128.62,some small effort in a muscle group and
1131.72,not and feel great about that this is
1133.4,what we generally call muscular
1134.539,endurance so this is something like I
1136.7,want to be able to walk up those 10
1138.14,flights of steps and my quads aren't
1139.88,burning at the end of it right or it
1142.82,even gives me energy another thing
1144.679,you'll want to ask your body to do is to
1146.78,be able to perform a tremendous amount
1148.58,of work
1149.9,for a longer period of time something in
1152.0,the realm of you know 20 to 80 seconds
1154.34,so this could be something like if
1156.679,you're surfing and you've got to paddle
1158.12,extremely hard for a minute to get on on
1160.16,top of a wave or you want to you got
1162.2,you're out riding your bike and you need
1163.7,to be able to get up a hill and it's a
1165.08,very Steep Hill these are going to take
1166.82,maximal efforts for some small amount of
1170.24,time and then you'll get back up there
1171.32,we tend to call that maximum anaerobic
1173.419,capacity so that the max amount of work
1175.4,you can perform at a higher rate for
1177.98,some amount of seconds to like maybe a
1180.38,minute
1181.34,past that is your ability to repeat an
1184.34,effort kind of like that for something
1186.559,like 5 to 15 minutes and this example
1189.02,would be run a mile right some some
1191.419,interval like that which is a longer
1192.919,distance right that is going to be your
1195.14,maximum aerobic capacity
1197.539,okay
1198.44,another thing you're going to want your
1199.76,body to do is we call sustained position
1201.58,so this is you want to be able to sit in
1204.08,your chair at work and have perfect
1206.12,posture for 20 30 40 minutes right you
1209.6,want to be able to stand in line at a
1211.22,grocery store for 15 minutes and not
1212.84,have a breakdown in posture so you want
1214.64,to be able to maintain position when
1215.9,you're riding your bike you're not
1217.1,collapsing you're doing any of these
1218.6,activities and you don't get hurt
1221.48,or lose efficiency simply because you
1223.88,couldn't sustain basic positions all
1226.46,right whatever those shapes and
1227.6,positions need to be
1229.16,okay and then the last one is a maximum
1232.1,distance so you won't be able to go for
1234.02,a longer hike or have just a long day at
1236.539,Disneyland for whatever it needs to be
1238.16,and feel great at the end of it right so
1240.98,the goal with all of these things is not
1242.9,can you just do them but can you do them
1245.059,and then you feel good afterwards so
1247.7,we're back in a right position where
1249.08,they give you energy you feel good about
1251.24,it and it's not just something you had
1253.16,to do and you regretted and you felt
1254.66,awful so those are the factors I think
1257.419,about when someone says I want better
1258.799,endurance is I want to walk backwards
1260.539,and say okay when you say endurance what
1262.039,do you mean and that's generally the
1263.48,things I've come across as if you can
1265.52,handle all of those things you're going
1267.5,to feel like you're in fantastic shape
1269.12,you're going to feel your recovery is
1271.22,going to be excellent and your physical
1273.2,performance in the gym or in any of the
1274.94,sporting activities you do will be
1276.559,enhanced given what you told us a little
1278.539,bit earlier that endurance really
1280.76,reflects fatigue and management and
1283.64,energy production
1285.14,how do each and both of those things
1288.26,relate to endurance at a mechanistic
1290.72,level so really what I'm asking is what
1293.179,is fatigue management and what is energy
1295.039,production in order to do that it's
1297.26,important that we understand all of
1298.88,those functional capacities that I just
1301.039,talked about
1302.059,they all have different points of
1303.98,failure
1305.12,okay so in order to then work backwards
1307.88,and say well how do I optimize my
1309.98,performance in all those categories we
1311.72,need to go through each one and figure
1312.98,out where am I failing some of them are
1314.96,going to be failing because of fatigue
1316.88,management and some of them will be
1318.38,failing because of energy production
1319.82,issues so if we walk through a little
1321.98,bit of how we make energy and how we
1324.26,handle fatigue then we're going to have
1326.179,a better understanding of exactly what
1327.799,to do for each one of these categories
1329.419,if you feel like one of them in
1331.039,particular is worse for you or lagging
1333.62,behind or if in general you just want to
1335.48,improve all of them all right now I want
1337.52,to make a little bit of a 90 degree turn
1338.84,here
1339.679,I'm going to do it with strategy though
1341.24,I promise and I want to ask you a very
1342.679,simple question
1344.24,how do you lose weight
1347.0,I was taught that the calories in
1350.299,calories out
1351.679,thermodynamics of energy utilization
1354.52,governs most everything that is if I'm
1357.26,ingesting
1358.52,less caloric energy than I burn
1361.88,then I'm going to lose weight and if I'm
1363.919,ingesting exactly as much as I burn I'll
1366.38,maintain weight and if I ingest more
1367.94,then I burn
1369.98,then I'll gain weight sure that is the
1372.98,approach you would take
1374.419,what I'm asking really is how are you
1377.059,actually physically losing the weight
1379.34,so my understanding is that we have
1381.2,different fuel sources in the body
1383.24,glycogen
1385.1,which is stored in muscle and liver body
1387.32,fat which is sort of mainly white
1389.72,adipose tissue and which is subcutaneous
1392.96,and around our organs intra visceral fat
1394.94,and that we can also use protein as a
1397.94,fuel and then as I recall there's also a
1400.94,phosphocreatine system and I think
1404.299,you're going to tell me that each of
1405.559,these systems is tapped into on
1408.32,different time scales and perhaps
1410.539,according to different levels of
1411.919,exertion and I'm certain that what I
1415.22,just said is not exhaustive but
1418.1,hopefully it is most or entirely correct
1422.059,pretty correct what's that got to do
1424.159,with fat loss
1425.659,at some point body fat stores adipose
1429.64,adipocytes fat cells are going to start
1432.08,liberating fat as a fuel source
1434.9,and the stimulus for that I'm assuming
1438.02,is going to be that other fuel sources
1440.179,are either depleted or that the energy
1443.36,and metabolic systems of the body
1446.48,I don't want to say decide because they
1447.98,don't have their own Consciousness but
1449.419,are um our flip signals are signaling in
1452.84,a way that registers that body fat would
1456.26,be the optimal fuel source given how
1459.26,long
1460.159,or into and or intensely a given
1462.679,activity has been performed okay we have
1466.28,some stuff to clean up there but we're
1467.84,still not really answering the question
1470.419,how am I actually losing that body fat
1472.4,uh how is it actually leaving the body
1474.26,correct uh my understanding is that it
1476.72,leaves the body through respiration aha
1479.36,so now we have some interesting things
1481.28,to talk about
1483.02,how am I actually losing fat via
1485.6,respiration what the hell does that even
1486.98,mean how is something that occupied this
1489.74,physical space on the side of me leaving
1492.44,my body through my mouth
1494.179,and that is a very clear answer there
1495.799,right which I'm sure you're queued up to
1497.36,when you take a breath in you're
1499.82,generally breathing in oxygen O2 that's
1502.1,some other things but we'll just stick
1503.36,to oxygen when you exhale you're
1505.52,breathing out CO2 the difference between
1507.98,those two is that carbon molecule well
1510.38,one of the things that's important to
1511.58,understand here is all of your
1513.5,carbohydrates which is that word itself
1516.86,is a carbon that has been hydrated so it
1519.02,is a carbon molecule attached to a water
1520.7,molecule it is a simple chain of carbons
1523.1,your fat molecules are also chains of
1525.74,carbon all of metabolism really in terms
1529.279,of energy production is simply trying to
1531.44,figure out a way to break those carbon
1534.44,bonds as a result we get energy from
1536.48,that we use that energy to create a
1537.98,molecule called ATP which is the central
1539.96,source of energy for any living being
1542.0,right that carbon is then floating
1545.24,around in free form which is bad news
1548.24,internally so we've got to figure out a
1550.34,way to get that carbon out of our system
1552.02,so all of energy production all of
1554.539,fatigue management really comes down to
1556.4,this core issue of how are we handling
1558.08,carbon and how are we moving it around
1560.419,the body and so what we do is we do this
1562.94,sneaky thing so another question I'd
1564.14,like to ask people is why do we breathe
1567.26,well
1568.82,for two reasons uh to bring oxygen into
1571.64,the system and to offload carbon dioxide
1573.679,but the neural trigger for breathing is
1577.039,when carbon dioxide hits a threshold
1579.44,level and the set of neurons in the
1581.419,brain stem and elsewhere uh activate the
1585.08,phrenic nerve or the gas reflex or a
1587.0,combination of things and we inhale or
1589.4,inhale right so a reduction of oxygen
1592.4,intake generally doesn't stimulate
1593.9,ventilation unless you're at altitude
1595.76,then that sort of changes right in
1597.679,general it's an elevation in CO2 that's
1599.9,going to stimulate breathing off the
1601.88,only reason you bring in O2 for the most
1604.7,part is to get rid of the CO2 oxygen is
1608.12,not a fuel source
1609.559,it is not a way and it works the same
1611.659,with fire by the way so you know you
1613.76,have to have oxygen present for a fire
1615.86,to go and if you use quelch oxygen the
1617.419,fire will go out right that's about half
1618.74,of
1619.88,um how those like fire extinguishers
1622.4,work but we think then that means oxygen
1625.94,is the fuel it is not the fuel it is
1627.799,something entirely different it is a
1629.24,necessary Pro it is a product that is
1631.159,necessary for the metabolism process to
1633.679,actually occur all right so we're kind
1636.38,of dancing around an idea here which is
1637.94,this carbon cycle of life
1640.4,so what happens in plants is they
1643.82,generally will breathe in the opposite
1645.98,and breathe out the opposite of humans
1647.36,so a plant will breathe in CO2 and
1649.7,exhale O2 all right this is why we have
1651.919,to have a certain amount of these things
1653.12,and algae and forests and trees and
1655.64,stuff to maintain this O2 CO2 balance in
1658.279,our atmosphere we do the opposite so we
1660.5,have this wonderful circle of life we
1662.179,breathe in O2 breathe out CO2 they do
1664.4,the opposite well what happens is
1666.679,because carbohydrates are long chains of
1669.919,carbon and fats are as well generally
1671.779,when we think about fats by the way it's
1673.82,important to understand that structure a
1675.2,little bit so if we think about
1676.659,triglycerides it is a three carbon
1679.52,backbone chain of glycerol so one two
1681.98,three and horizontally running off of
1684.559,each one of those are fatty acid chains
1687.559,right so we form this structure that
1688.94,looks like an e right like the letter e
1690.919,three in the back and then three chains
1692.84,coming off of it each of those chains
1694.88,are called fatty acids and each of those
1696.62,fatty acids are a length of carbon right
1699.26,or a number of carbons strung together
1700.82,however many carbons are there
1702.74,determines which type of fatty acid it
1704.659,is right so stearic acid linoleic acid
1706.64,like any different number of things it's
1708.559,also what determines whether or not it
1710.0,is a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated
1712.279,as if carbon requires a special thing
1714.74,called a double bond so if there's a
1716.6,double bond across every carbon and
1718.159,carbon then they're all fully saturated
1719.779,and you're great if there's any of them
1721.52,that are not double bonded and in fact
1723.919,an example if there is one that doesn't
1725.779,have a double bond that is now called
1727.279,Mono and saturated if there are many it
1729.38,is called polyunsaturated
1731.179,so there's pros and cons to all these
1732.799,things right in either case we're still
1735.2,talking long carbon chains so what a
1737.659,plant will do
1738.86,is bring in carbon and then it has this
1742.039,wonderful ability to use energy from the
1743.96,sun called photosynthesis and it can
1746.24,take those carbons that it inhales and
1748.94,use the energy from the Sun to form a
1751.1,bond now in our prior discussion when
1753.26,we're going over hypertrophy we talked
1755.659,about the energy that was required to go
1757.159,through protein synthesis that's because
1759.14,forming a new atom or a new bond between
1762.14,atoms oftentimes takes energy in this
1764.24,cases it does the same thing happens
1766.399,here so if a plant does not have oxygen
1768.919,or does not have carbon dioxide in the
1770.539,air it has no fuel the basically think
1772.76,about it is that's what it eats it needs
1774.98,to get nitrogen from the ground in the
1776.6,soil just like we need to get nitrogen
1778.279,from our protein but fuel wise it needs
1780.679,to get carbon dioxide then it needs sun
1782.539,to give it energy so it can actually
1784.82,form that Bond right that's what it's
1786.74,getting its fuel from
1788.419,all right so if we think about
1791.0,um a classic
1792.5,uh plant produce the plant that produces
1795.14,either a starch or a fruit here's what
1798.679,happens
1799.76,it inhales that carbon and it starts
1802.279,packing it away now in a root vegetable
1804.5,what it does is it stores those things
1806.659,together and if we store that thing and
1808.22,we grow fruit at the bottom of it we
1809.6,tend to call those things starches
1811.76,all right it's going to then take the
1814.1,carbon that is packed away in its root
1815.96,and send it up the tree and it's going
1818.899,to actually do that by breaking it down
1820.279,into a smaller form of carbohydrate that
1822.679,we tend to often call things like
1824.299,sucrose and glucose it'll ship that up
1827.6,the tree it'll go out to the leaves and
1829.46,it'll convert it into the fruit and it's
1831.02,going to eventually transform that stuff
1832.88,into smaller carbon things called
1834.679,fructose and if we think about the fruit
1837.5,are the sugar in fruit it's often in the
1840.08,form of fructose or sucrose or a
1842.48,combination and sometimes glucose so we
1844.94,have these smaller carbon six carbon
1846.86,chains generally in the form of glucose
1849.2,that are being made from this larger
1851.96,storage of uh carbohydrates that we call
1856.82,um starch right so it's packed in
1859.82,together
1860.72,your body does the exact same thing so
1864.14,if it's a potato
1865.7,and it has a whole bunch
1867.679,of glucose packed away we call that
1869.84,starch if it's in your quadricep and we
1873.08,pack about a whole bunch of glucose Away
1875.48,We Now call it glycogen if it's in your
1878.659,blood as that six carbon chain we call
1881.48,it glucose if it's in the tree and in
1883.88,the fruit we call it fructose right
1885.62,those are different molecules but that's
1886.88,effectively the same thing happens so
1888.38,the biology or the chemistry is almost
1890.899,identical it just runs in the reverse
1893.059,order and that's why again at tubers and
1895.94,potatoes and stuff tend to be starches
1897.559,and fruits tend to be glucose fructose
1900.08,of sucrose so we have this
1902.48,a wonderful Circle of Life the plants
1905.779,can survive on just breathing in the CO2
1908.779,and then getting the energy from the Sun
1910.1,we don't have that ability at least to
1912.14,my knowledge to run through
1913.399,photosynthesis so the only way we can
1915.559,get carbon into our system is to
1918.14,actually ingest carbon which means we
1920.48,have to eat the starch the fruit
1923.659,the animal some other form of stored
1926.419,carbon to get that into our system
1929.12,we then pack that away we put the
1931.22,carbohydrates as you mentioned earlier
1932.72,either on our liver
1934.039,our blood or in our muscles we put the
1937.46,fat generally in adipose tissue we'll
1939.2,put a little bit in muscle cells as
1940.82,intramuscular triglycerides and then the
1943.22,protein will use as structure right to
1946.34,do different things we don't like to use
1947.6,protein as material or fuel it's better
1950.24,used as structure and what we have to do
1952.64,then is if all of a sudden we realize
1954.2,that storage is getting too much in our
1956.419,body in other words we're gaining too
1958.1,much weight we have to figure out how to
1960.02,get the carbons out of our body
1962.24,and that is metabolism right anytime
1965.72,we're trying to break a carbon bonds
1967.58,though we can get energy to make ATP
1969.32,that's going to release the carbon out
1971.659,of our tissue into the blood we have to
1974.0,bring in oxygen to bind that carbon
1976.399,molecule to make CO2 so we can exhale it
1978.44,and put it back into the atmosphere it's
1981.02,a beautiful description of the circle of
1983.48,life and
1985.279,energy utilization in the human body
1988.94,I have to ask the question that I'm sure
1990.679,many people are wondering about which is
1992.899,if indeed we exhale these carbons and
1997.58,as it relates to Fat Loss that is the
1999.679,way that we lose fat if we're in a sub
2002.26,caloric state for instance
2004.6,has it ever been explored as to whether
2008.159,increasing the duration or intensity of
2011.019,exhales can accelerate fat loss I mean
2013.179,that's sort of The Logical extension of
2014.559,what you described and here I'm actually
2016.48,interested equally in whether or not the
2020.26,answer is yes as well as whether it
2023.62,could be no because I could imagine if
2026.679,the answer is yes well then there's some
2028.72,interesting protocols to emerge from
2030.1,that but that if it's no it will reveal
2032.38,to us some important bottlenecks about
2034.12,metabolism and energy utilization you
2036.7,ever seen those magicians who like show
2040.12,up and uh they can tell your mom's name
2044.799,or something like that before you
2046.059,because they can sort of hold you down a
2048.46,path yeah I mean not to take us down a
2049.839,deep dive tangent but I once went to the
2051.58,Magic Castle in Los Angeles and I was
2054.46,one of the people called up front and a
2057.0,in an incredible magician a named um I
2060.399,think his name was Ozzy mind or
2062.02,something uh I think that's right had me
2064.179,write my name on a card
2066.339,in a Sharpie pen I ripped up the card I
2069.76,ripped it up I put it in my pocket
2073.179,and at the end of the 10 or 15 minute
2076.06,bout of him doing a bunch of other
2077.679,tricks
2078.639,he asked me to look in my right shoe and
2081.879,under my foot in my right shoe was that
2085.179,card intact yeah and it was no longer in
2088.24,my pocket and I swear in my life I
2090.22,wasn't a a collaborator with him and to
2093.099,this day it still gives me chills
2095.379,because it well I I don't know how magic
2098.5,yeah right magic well the reason I say
2100.839,that is I've given that little Spiel and
2103.06,I just gave you the countless times on
2104.619,my glasses and I would say 99 of the
2107.32,time as soon as I stop the very first
2109.66,question is
2110.92,so can I just like
2113.02,do a bunch of exhales and lose fat which
2116.079,is wonderful because I was really hoping
2117.7,you would do that and you rolled right
2119.02,into my trap right you landed perfectly
2121.3,so I look like a like a a magician over
2124.119,here I feel like I should look in my
2125.44,right shoe right now no I asked the
2127.96,question because it's the logical
2129.64,extension of what you laid out but
2132.099,I know biology to be um both uh
2135.04,diabolical and cryptic but also
2138.3,Exquisite in the way that things are
2140.74,arranged and you don't get something for
2143.02,nothing there are no free passes in
2144.64,physiology that's the saying no free
2147.22,passes the answer to your question is
2148.96,yes
2149.98,100 yes in fact that is the only way to
2154.0,go about it you have two options you can
2156.579,ingest less carbon or you can expel more
2158.74,carbon people always say calories in
2160.18,calories out it's really carbon in
2161.56,carbonate
2162.579,that's what a calorie is Right calories
2164.14,the amount of energy we get per breaking
2166.359,a carbon Bond so it's really Less in
2169.42,less more out less in is fairly obvious
2172.06,whether that comes in any form and by
2173.8,the way
2174.579,this is exactly why the percentage of
2177.4,your intake coming from fats or
2178.96,carbohydrate it doesn't really matter
2180.76,that much if you look at fat loss
2183.54,clinical trials you guys may have
2185.5,covered this when Lane was in here I'm
2187.359,sure like this is something he talks
2188.68,about a lot it doesn't matter it's
2190.619,irrelevant because it's not about that
2193.3,there's nothing magic in those things
2195.339,they are different they have different
2196.54,physiological responses everything is
2198.579,different right no duh but in general
2200.92,it's just simply about carbon intake
2202.78,turns out fat has a lot more carbons per
2206.02,mole than carbohydrates do so there's
2208.599,more calories per mole in there so if
2211.48,you the physical amount of fat needs to
2213.579,come in as a smaller amount physical
2214.9,amount of carbohydrates these are coming
2216.7,it will come in as a larger amount but
2218.02,you can play
2219.04,any number of very high carb low fat
2221.92,what matters total calories right again
2224.74,it's not like the only thing that
2226.599,matters but you know what I'm saying
2227.68,some percentages in the way can go fat
2230.32,loss Works fantastic high fat low
2232.9,carbohydrate why why do all these things
2235.0,work because that's not about that it's
2237.52,about total intake of carbon total Expo
2241.06,so absolutely can you lose fat by simply
2244.42,exhaling more in fact that is exactly
2246.46,what you did this morning
2248.2,when I hopped on the airline bike when
2250.06,you did anything
2251.2,right the question is can you think of a
2253.839,scenario in which you could have a bunch
2255.76,of increased rates of exhalation
2259.599,that helps in Fat Loss sure I can think
2261.64,of a lot of things that will stimulate
2262.78,increased rates of exhalation one thing
2265.72,could be simply going
2269.44,right and so the question is like can I
2270.7,literally do some breath protocols where
2272.26,I force exhale and lose fat and the
2274.3,answer is yes
2276.7,but what happens what happens if you do
2279.22,hyperventilation training well my lab
2282.52,studies cyclic hyperventilation is one
2284.859,of our many uh deliberate protocols and
2287.26,one of the most prominent things that
2289.42,one observes is that levels of
2291.76,adrenaline increase very quickly
2294.339,extremely quick people feel jittery
2296.38,anxious stressed and unless they are
2298.54,consciously trying to Anchor their
2300.88,thinking about what that means and the
2303.04,benefits that to persisting typically
2305.56,they abort the cyclic hyperventilation
2307.54,protocol really quickly within seconds
2309.64,right you will feel tingling sweating
2311.859,all kinds of things you're
2312.82,hyperventilating right and we could we
2314.859,could talk a nauseam about how that
2317.2,changes everything from adrenaline to
2318.88,focus to a whole bunch of things so
2320.74,unfortunately a strategy of sitting
2322.9,around just exhaling more than you
2325.06,inhale
2326.56,technically helps you lose more fat but
2329.619,it's not going to last very long so then
2331.359,the question is well how do I get no
2332.859,situation or scenario in which I can
2335.079,increase my rate of expiration
2337.18,where I'm not going to pass out I'm not
2339.099,going and altering hypocapny and
2341.02,hypercapnia issues
2343.0,any idea of a situation in which you
2344.5,would have an enhanced rate of
2345.94,explanation without worrying about
2347.68,passing out
2348.82,sure a steady state exercise or not
2351.76,steady state exercise lifting weights
2354.0,intervals moderate training repeated any
2357.46,of these things they all work equally
2359.8,for fat loss because all they're doing
2362.14,is increasing respiration rate they're
2364.24,saying increased demand for energy
2367.56,increased exhalation
2369.7,that's the trick here and when you
2371.92,equate these things to that they have
2373.599,equal success in fat loss
2375.82,it doesn't matter theoretically
2378.94,where you're getting it from and so when
2381.339,we get into this idea of well what are
2383.26,the best training strategies for fat
2384.64,loss
2386.14,it doesn't matter which one of these
2389.079,tactics you pick
2391.0,as long as you maintain a consistent
2393.04,adherence over time
2394.96,because of this exact fact it doesn't
2397.3,matter if you're burning quote unquote
2399.099,fat in the exercise session or if you're
2402.22,burning carbohydrates in the exercise
2404.14,session it is totally irrelevant to your
2407.44,net fat loss over time okay now there's
2410.5,some significant misconceptions there
2412.78,about what I just talked and I would
2415.18,love to come back and walk through that
2416.619,in more detail but that's the main
2418.66,take-home message here
2420.46,it won't matter what's coming in and it
2422.56,won't matter what's coming out because
2423.76,in either case it is the same rate of
2426.099,oxygen in and CO2 out that's the key
2429.94,metric and hopefully this helps a lot of
2432.579,people have some relief because they're
2434.74,like man you're so tied up on what is
2436.66,the exact protocol for training for
2438.339,optimizing fat loss what's the exact
2440.44,nutritional intervention I need for fat
2442.24,loss and then you wonder why all these
2444.339,different diets can work effectively and
2446.8,wonder why all these different training
2448.119,protocols you know surely you know
2449.56,somebody who lost a bunch of weight and
2451.66,the only thing they did is they just
2453.04,started running
2454.06,there was no Advanced protocol they just
2455.74,started running and they ran five miles
2457.06,every day that works and then tons of
2459.579,people who tried that and like didn't
2460.599,lose anything and lots of people who
2462.4,went to I went to cardio kickboxing
2464.619,class lost weight oh I just started
2466.66,doing intervals on my law why why
2468.64,mysteriously you'll do all these things
2470.32,work
2471.099,they had you have something had some
2473.02,spidey sense have to has to be going off
2474.7,in your brain where like there has to be
2476.38,something linking these things
2478.9,and what's linking it is simply carbon
2480.76,Exchange
2481.839,so put yourself in a position in which
2483.94,you are exhaling more than you and
2485.32,inhaling without passing out
2487.72,the other problem is if you were to
2489.46,Simply do a breathing protocol
2491.8,while the rate of exhalation would go up
2493.9,after that you would correct and go in
2495.82,the opposite direction so that's the
2497.38,problem is your net carbon the output
2498.82,over the course today is not going to
2500.079,change unless you increase the demand
2502.359,for energy and that's how you get into
2504.4,that negative state
2506.5,along these lines of exhaling carbons as
2510.579,the route for fat loss
2513.04,it makes me wonder whether or not
2515.44,increasing lung capacity is possible I'm
2518.5,guessing the answer is yes and whether
2520.119,or not
2521.26,increasing lung capacity is a good goal
2524.44,and route to enhancing fat loss
2526.839,essentially what I'm asking is if you
2528.82,can offload more CO2 okay carbons per
2534.099,exhale
2535.66,are you a more efficient fat loss
2538.06,machine it's a wonderful thought and the
2539.92,answer would be no
2541.119,not something you worry about because
2544.24,if you were to Exhale more
2546.4,carbon than actually needed
2548.74,now we're in a state of inefficiency
2550.599,you're burning way more energy than
2552.88,needed to do your activity the heart has
2556.06,a metric called cardiac output this is
2558.88,in Sciences we abbreviate this as Q
2561.339,for some odd reasons it's either seal or
2563.38,q and cardiac output
2565.66,is heart rate multiplied by stroke
2567.579,volume so it's how many beats per minute
2569.02,you're having as well as how much
2570.099,blood's coming out of it so cardiac
2571.78,output is actually
2573.7,very specific to energy needs if you try
2576.76,to work around that it's just going to
2578.319,adjust itself so what I mean by this is
2580.06,if you were able to increase your stroke
2582.28,volumes the amount of blood coming out
2583.54,per pump you would automatically adjust
2585.28,reduce your heart rate so that you keep
2587.579,cardiac output
2589.54,exact to energetic demands so you're
2592.42,sort of pushing one end of this of the
2594.22,spectrum but your body will pull the
2595.359,other one back to keep you at that exact
2596.98,same neutral level so if you look at if
2599.92,you think about like cardiovascular
2601.24,adaptations to endurance training and
2603.7,any type of endurance training a common
2605.619,thing people will understand is resting
2607.9,heart rate and so what that number is is
2610.42,just how many beats per minute you're
2611.8,having when you're sitting here doing
2612.819,nothing a very positive adaptation is a
2616.06,lowering of that resting rate over time
2618.24,as general numbers what you will hear is
2620.68,people will say things like a normal
2623.319,resting heart rate is between 60 to 80
2625.359,beats per minute and you know if any of
2628.119,the things I've talked about
2630.52,um with the individuals I work with I
2632.56,don't work with anybody with disease
2633.88,just to clarify that I don't do anything
2635.68,with disease management treatment
2637.18,anything it's always about people who
2638.98,are in a good spot
2640.3,who want to optimize or get to the next
2642.52,level whether this is professional
2643.9,athletes trying to to Peak for physical
2646.119,performance or uh the folks in our rapid
2649.0,Health optimization program that feel
2651.76,good again it's not disease stuff and
2653.44,they want to feel incredible
2655.42,one of the metrics we're going to pay
2656.68,attention to is this resting heart rate
2658.06,so here's what happens as you improve
2660.099,your endurance
2661.72,your resting heart rate will go down if
2664.06,I see somebody over 70 beats per minute
2666.64,um unless something's going on you're
2668.02,not physically fed
2669.52,regardless of whether or not that is
2670.9,quote unquote within the normative
2671.98,values I want to see everybody's sub 60
2673.839,beats per minute or close right and that
2676.66,does not a difficult thing to really get
2678.7,to for most people so if you train a lot
2682.0,regardless of how you train intervals
2684.22,steady state
2685.72,doesn't matter that resting heart rate
2687.579,will come down but since energy demands
2690.46,at rest haven't really changed cardiac
2693.7,Alpha stays the same so what happens is
2696.46,stroke volume goes up so literally like
2700.24,we trained your quadriceps on the Legacy
2702.339,engine machine to get stronger so you
2704.319,can produce more Force per contraction
2706.18,the heart will do the exact same thing
2708.28,and so as you're able to get more of the
2711.339,blood out of your heart per pump
2713.74,the heart realizes I don't need to pump
2715.42,as often
2716.68,so that's the compensatory adaptation
2718.839,which is saying hey look I don't need to
2720.7,beat 60 times a minute I now need to
2722.38,beat 55 times a minute because I'm
2724.119,getting the same amount of Blood Out per
2726.7,pump chill and this is why your resting
2729.28,heart rate goes down your resting stroke
2731.319,volume goes up but your cardiac output
2733.24,is identical so that's not a good metric
2736.119,of Fitness it's going to stay the same
2737.5,cardiac output will only adjust for
2739.78,energetic changes all right energy
2741.88,requirements in the acute moment right
2743.68,how much do I need go which is going to
2745.839,be determined by ventilation right how
2747.76,much air am I bringing in and putting
2749.14,out that's going to determine cardiac
2750.88,output and that's going to determine
2752.26,where we're at if you were to do like a
2754.359,sub maximal exercise test
2756.94,when you were unfit to when you're fit
2759.7,or when you're fit the way you're super
2761.38,fit at sub Max you're going to see the
2763.54,same thing
2764.44,cardiac output will be identical and
2766.24,you're like damn nothing happened what
2767.8,you're not realizing is your heart rate
2769.44,at that same workload is now lower
2772.9,and that's efficiency because your
2774.819,stroke volume is higher where it gets
2776.68,people tripped up is at Max
2779.079,because you may not see much of a change
2780.88,at Max because you won't really you
2783.22,don't really see an increase in maximum
2784.48,heart rate with Fitness that's not a
2785.8,thing right so maximum heart rate is not
2787.78,a good proxy for fit or unfit or
2790.0,anything like that stroke volume will
2791.92,get limited eventually by filling
2793.3,capacity of your heart it has to have so
2795.819,much time to fill up with blood before
2797.02,it can contract again and squeeze the
2798.46,blood out and when you have a heart rate
2800.26,of 200 beats per minute that just
2802.54,doesn't leave much time to fill and so
2804.22,it won't really push you past that so
2806.22,don't worry about trying to increase
2808.24,your maximum heart rate that's not
2810.04,necessarily a good thing and it won't
2811.18,really change but your cardiac health
2813.28,will because stroke volume will be
2815.14,higher but that doesn't necessarily mean
2817.0,that I should avoid training that gets
2818.8,me up toward maximal heart rate correct
2820.48,oh you should absolutely do it right
2821.92,that's what that was my assumption I'd
2824.02,like to take a brief break and
2825.339,acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens
2827.26,athletic greens is a vitamin mineral
2829.54,probiotic and adaptogen drink designed
2832.119,to help you meet all of your
2833.319,foundational nutritional needs I've been
2835.54,taking athletic greens daily since 2012.
2838.3,so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor
2840.04,of this podcast the reason I started
2841.839,taking athletic greens and the reason I
2843.339,still take athletic greens once or twice
2845.319,a day is that it helps me meet all of my
2847.54,foundational nutritional needs that is
2849.46,it covers my vitamins my minerals and
2851.44,the probiotics are especially important
2853.18,to me athletic greens also contains
2854.92,adaptogens which are critical for
2856.78,recovering from stress from exercise
2858.4,from work or just general life if you'd
2860.859,like to try athletic greens you can go
2862.24,to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim
2865.0,a special offer they'll give you five
2866.319,free travel packs and they'll give you a
2868.0,year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again if
2871.119,you'd like to try athletic greens go to
2872.7,athleticreens.com huberman to claim the
2875.38,special offer getting back to energy
2877.48,production and metabolism
2879.46,so we've got these different modes of
2881.56,moving energy but making and breaking
2884.5,energy Bonds in the body moving energy
2887.079,into different tissues and out of
2888.64,different tissues and indeed out of the
2890.02,body through exhalation
2892.42,how do each of these different modes of
2895.0,energy utilization
2897.579,relate to different modes of movement
2899.68,and exercise yeah in my mind I'm
2901.78,starting to draw a bridge between
2904.9,okay when I walk for 60 minutes
2908.68,you know if I'm talking I'm breathing a
2910.66,bit more maybe I'm burning a little more
2912.52,fat after all speech is a modified
2915.76,exhale
2917.14,um and amazing if I'm sprinting
2920.619,um breathing differently and if I'm um
2923.079,you know doing a 30 minute moderate
2924.819,quote unquote moderate jog breathing
2926.92,differently so you've beautifully
2928.66,Illustrated this bridge between energy
2930.28,production and utilization and carbon
2933.52,dioxide offload through exhalation
2935.98,what are some of the specifics about
2938.02,energy utilization
2939.819,according to different modes of exercise
2941.88,and if we could better Define modes of
2944.859,exercise or types of exercise that
2946.78,trigger specific adaptations I think
2948.28,this is where the the bridge will move
2949.72,from being a a mere line to a real
2952.06,structure yeah absolutely I want to lay
2954.94,one more foundational piece and then
2957.88,it's going to be much easier to
2959.74,understand
2960.94,the limitations I put on some of these
2962.859,training protocols as well as the lack
2965.14,of limitations okay so it's really
2967.0,really important the way I want to start
2969.16,this is
2970.599,we have this this Foundation now of of
2974.2,carbon and and basic energy production
2976.78,that's not to say there's no difference
2978.819,there is and that difference is
2980.319,important but maybe we can answer the
2982.42,question from earlier which is
2984.4,actually something you asked me this
2985.839,morning when we were exercising
2987.819,you're like training fasted
2990.22,right does training fasted
2993.22,enhance fat loss
2995.26,and the logic is sound if I don't have
2998.5,any fuel then I should be burning more
3000.9,fat therefore I should be losing more
3002.4,fat it's sound it's not true
3004.92,is this great idea it's one of these
3007.44,classic things in science and exercise
3008.66,physiology where like sounds good
3011.22,turns out it's not it's actually a
3012.72,pretty gross misunderstanding of
3014.339,metabolism
3015.359,so it's not to pick on that topic I
3017.52,don't really care about that topic but
3018.78,it is a it's a common question it also
3021.599,gives me an opportunity to just tell you
3023.64,more about metabolism so
3025.98,here's what happens
3027.54,you're breathing in O2 and breathing out
3029.339,CO2 however the ratio to that is what we
3032.46,call the either rer respiratory exchange
3034.38,ratio or RQ respiratory quotient and I'm
3036.66,not going to differentiate those two
3037.8,they're not the same thing but we're
3039.359,going to skip past that for now as you
3041.64,begin to increase exercise intensity
3044.16,the percentage of o2 to CO2 rises in the
3047.7,favor of CO2 so you start breathing out
3049.68,way more CO2 than you are breathing in
3052.14,O2 right and so if we were to look at
3054.78,that number you know once the
3056.16,relationship Echoes up so at rest most
3059.22,people have a of a value that we would
3061.8,typically call something like 0.6
3064.619,okay and that's again the relationship
3066.599,between O2 and CO2
3068.46,maybe 0.7 if you were to go for a walk
3071.52,that increases slightly because you're
3073.38,now expiring CO2 at a higher rate so now
3076.619,you've moved up to say 0.8 or something
3078.599,like that one of the ways that we Mark
3081.059,somebody of achieving an actual VO2 max
3083.4,on a test is if that value exceeds 1.1
3088.38,now any of you who are paying attention
3090.66,are thinking wait a minute how the hell
3092.46,can a ratio between two things ever get
3094.559,past one
3095.76,well that's because you're getting in a
3097.2,place where you're actually offloading
3098.819,more CO2 than is actually necessary and
3102.359,this is what actually causes and
3103.859,explains a thing that people like to
3105.359,call Epoch which is excess exercise post
3108.42,oxygen consumption this is another way
3110.579,to think about it
3111.78,the only reason you're breathing is to
3114.18,bring in oxygen when offloads CO2
3116.579,right
3117.96,if I'm no longer exercising why am I
3120.78,still breathing
3122.579,in other words once you stop the demand
3125.4,or the need for for energy you should
3128.04,stop ventilating
3129.9,but you don't
3131.339,right that's because in the case of low
3133.8,intensity exercise the second you stop
3137.88,you're right back down to resting
3139.2,ventilation no problem because you were
3141.599,able to match the need for energy with
3143.339,the offload of waste one to one during
3146.46,that exercise when you start creeping up
3148.859,the intensity you can't do that so you
3151.14,have to basically start stealing a
3153.42,little bit of fuel here so even though
3155.28,you're done exercising you're still
3157.079,ventilating because you have to pay that
3158.7,back and pay that back by that I
3160.8,specifically mean you have to bring in
3163.02,oxygen because you have a whole bunch of
3165.119,waste that's been accumulating in your
3166.559,tissue that you've got to deal with and
3168.839,I'll walk you through what that waste is
3170.88,it's a particular molecule that a lot of
3172.44,people have heard of but grossly
3173.76,misunderstand
3175.38,so you got to be able to handle that so
3176.819,the reason that you sit there and go
3179.64,and continue to ventilate is because
3181.079,you're now trying to pay back that
3182.7,excess post exercise oxygen debt that's
3185.52,that oxygen debt we're specifically
3186.9,talking about all right so
3189.3,that being said as we start cruising up
3191.76,that RQ starts going up up up up up up
3193.5,up and if we get to one your 1.0 you're
3196.68,you're in a like you're hurting you're
3198.119,in a pretty good spot all right I like
3200.88,that you're hurting you're in a pretty
3202.2,good spot yeah a window into Dr Annie
3205.38,galpin's mind now you really want to be
3207.599,a subject in his uh his laboratory study
3209.819,sure
3211.099,masochists swarm to Andy's lab
3213.119,absolutely all right
3215.52,so
3217.319,the idea that I will lose more fat
3221.64,by being in an exercise situation that
3223.859,is burning more fat it seems to make
3225.9,sense but it's a massive failure to
3228.54,understand the metabolism it's the exact
3231.18,same explanation to like exercising
3233.22,fasted doesn't matter so the exercising
3236.04,fasted issue under normal circumstances
3237.96,is irrelevant because you have plenty of
3240.96,fuel in the system even when you haven't
3243.78,eaten breakfast that morning now if
3245.4,you're talking like extended fasting
3247.02,over multiple days this is a different
3249.66,scenario if muscle glycogen liver
3251.94,glycogen and blood glucose are at
3254.16,sufficient levels then you absolutely
3256.38,have enough energy to perform almost any
3258.839,type of exercise that most people are
3260.46,doing
3261.24,you know maybe if you're Rob and you're
3263.04,at Mile 20 today it's a different story
3265.14,but the vast majority of us have plenty
3266.7,of fuel sitting around so we're not
3268.2,going to burn more into fat
3270.42,um just because we didn't eat breakfast
3271.5,that morning so that just doesn't make
3273.059,energetic sense we have a lot of backup
3274.859,supplies you're never out the trick here
3277.26,is this is there's a there's a concept
3278.64,here we call crossover concept so as we
3281.52,are starting to move up exercise
3282.66,intensity
3284.099,we start burning a higher percentage of
3286.26,our fuel from carbohydrates and a lower
3290.099,percentage of our fuel coming from fat
3292.859,I'm sleeping
3294.42,that's the highest percentage of your
3296.64,fuel that will be coming from fat of any
3298.559,activity you could ever do so if the
3300.42,theory that I'm going to stay at a lower
3302.46,intensity to burn more fat was true the
3305.4,optimal fat burning strategy would then
3308.04,be to sleep
3309.9,like that doesn't make sense of course
3311.64,it doesn't so why would then going at a
3313.68,slightly elevated rate somehow all of a
3315.599,sudden magically make you lose fat
3317.94,it doesn't actually make sense when you
3319.38,think about that where you're like oh
3320.28,yeah there's no way
3321.78,so
3322.92,it's a percentage trick it's a
3324.9,difference between absolute and relative
3326.22,this is what this confusion is so yes as
3329.46,you start doing lower intensity exercise
3331.14,whether you're faster than audit it's
3332.7,irrelevant but lower intensity exercise
3334.559,a greater percentage of your fuel
3337.079,is coming from fat however your total
3340.44,fuel expenditure is very low
3343.98,so that whole total carbon balance is
3347.16,not really being shifted much
3349.079,as you start exercising at a very high
3351.72,intensity you actually start getting a
3354.24,higher percentage of your fuel from
3355.38,carbohydrate and a lower percentage from
3357.18,fat in fact at rest about the highest
3360.9,you can get in most people is about 60
3363.599,of your fuel from fat
3366.24,as you're sleeping you might be 70 but
3369.18,you'll never be in a position ever no
3371.22,matter what sort of thing you've heard
3373.38,on the internet you'll never be in a
3375.54,situation where fat is your only fuel
3378.119,source
3379.319,the highest I've probably ever seen is
3380.94,like 70 percent
3383.04,um you should probably beat about that
3384.54,that's a kind of a good number to think
3386.7,um honestly but people will understand a
3389.339,little bit about metabolism to be
3391.079,dangerous but not enough we'll we'll
3392.819,throw out these terms like fat adapted
3394.98,and fat adapted is a real thing but is a
3397.5,massive misunderstanding oftentimes
3399.599,right it is this idea thinking like I
3401.4,can get into a spot where I'm maximizing
3403.38,fat burning maximizing fat burning
3406.559,and maximizing fat for exercise and
3409.5,maximizing fat loss over time are not
3412.2,the same thing at all right that's the
3414.839,confusion so if you enhance fat
3416.64,oxidation and exercise that does not
3419.28,enhance fat loss
3421.079,per se
3422.28,right so this is a lot of the confusion
3424.319,that's happening
3425.46,right so as we start moving up we can
3427.92,never get in a position where we're
3429.119,using fat only as a fuel again at best
3431.52,you're at 70 fat 30 carbohydrate for a
3434.4,lot of reasons we probably just don't
3435.72,have time to get into today
3437.22,however the opposite is possible when
3439.98,you get into true high intensity
3441.66,exercise you'll be basically 100
3443.96,carbohydrate and zero percent fat all
3446.64,right that is very possible that in fact
3448.14,is 1.0 that's what our Q 1.1 is actually
3451.02,because your ventilation got so high you
3453.059,actually exceeded that number even
3455.099,though you're at 100 carbohydrate this
3457.859,is what people came up with the idea
3459.0,then it's like whoa I don't want to burn
3460.26,carbs I want to lose fat
3462.0,so my response to that is always like
3463.859,okay great
3464.88,so it makes sense burning fat losing fat
3466.98,burning carbs is losing what then
3469.44,like you think your liver shrunk like
3472.26,wait a minute what did you lose then
3475.079,where'd it come from it's all coming as
3477.0,carbon don't worry about where it came
3479.52,from for your fuel
3481.26,it just has to come out as carbon
3484.02,right there are differences in exercise
3485.64,efficiency for performance with our
3487.74,professional athletes of course but if
3489.78,the only goal here is phallus it doesn't
3492.18,matter where you get it from
3493.98,the last Bridge we have to connect here
3495.54,is like well wait a minute if I only
3497.46,burned carbohydrate
3499.74,how did I actually lose that fat there
3501.78,was there was that love handle sitting
3503.7,on the side of me how did that come out
3505.68,of me if I never burned that from my
3507.599,fuel what you're failing to understand
3509.46,is there's a balanced game that happens
3511.38,here so if you were to do a bunch of
3513.059,high intensity exercise training
3515.76,and you burned only muscle glycogen and
3518.16,blood glucose and maybe even you did it
3520.2,for so long you burned some liver
3521.819,glycogen
3523.44,the body understands that it has
3525.18,expelled a lot of energy
3527.04,from that side of the equation it's
3529.14,going to do a couple of things now it's
3530.52,very difficult
3531.839,to go through this fancy situation where
3533.64,you convert carbohydrates into fat and
3536.22,back and forth like that's actually like
3537.66,fairly hard what's easier to do with
3539.7,something you said earlier is actually
3541.14,just bias energetics to a different fuel
3544.079,source so in that scenario where you're
3546.96,down really low in your carbohydrate
3549.54,carbohydrate stores
3551.16,any carbohydrates you bring in are going
3553.859,to go to storage
3555.24,and since your net energy expenditure is
3557.76,something that your body regulates a lot
3559.14,any fat that you then bring in is going
3561.72,to be utilized as a fuel source because
3563.88,it knows it doesn't need it anymore that
3565.799,is in excess so that's how you actually
3568.319,use fat
3570.0,as a fuel because you've burned down
3572.76,carbohydrate storages
3575.16,as I'm hearing this uh a couple of
3577.5,things come to mind first of all
3579.66,thank you for that incredibly important
3582.059,description of what is otherwise a very
3585.059,confusing landscape for most people one
3587.579,of the key points I took away and
3589.98,I just want to say from the outset this
3592.02,is not exhaustive by any stretch is that
3595.04,burning fat does not equal losing fat
3597.66,from the body correct and then burning
3600.18,fat has to be divided into burning of
3602.4,body fat stores
3604.14,and we need to distinguish that from
3606.54,burning of dietary fat that is brought
3609.059,in correct oftentimes people don't
3611.059,disambiguate those correct
3613.74,and I'm also understanding that
3616.92,reducing one's body carbohydrate stores
3620.099,muscle glycogen liver glycogen Etc
3622.319,occurs during high intensity exercise
3624.24,yep as well as other ways but that is
3626.819,one very efficient way to tap into those
3628.98,stores which makes me wonder
3632.099,again this is one of these things that
3633.599,does it lead to a protocol
3635.76,makes me wonder whether or not doing
3637.619,high intensity let's say weight training
3639.48,for 45 to 60 Minutes 75 minutes of
3641.88,strength training power training
3643.44,hypertrophy training which we've covered
3645.54,in an episode about those topics
3647.579,and then doing some steady state
3650.819,cardiovascular exercise is there any
3653.88,benefit to that arrangement
3656.64,that would quote unquote enhance
3660.24,body fat loss from the body to be very
3663.359,specific now
3664.859,because unlike the idea that training
3668.04,fasted would shift the bias towards fat
3670.02,loss which it doesn't you've told us
3672.54,under those conditions muscle glycogen
3675.299,and maybe even liver glycogen is going
3677.579,to be depleted
3679.26,put simply can I enhance body fat loss
3681.78,by doing some cardio after a bout of
3684.119,weight training if you equate for total
3686.339,energy expenditure it won't matter
3688.74,now that you did bring up a very
3690.96,important point that I want to clarify
3693.299,if you look at the exercise modalities
3695.64,that we laid out in our previous uh
3698.04,conversations we talked about nine
3699.48,different adaptations one was skill and
3702.119,then speed power strength hypertrophy
3705.54,muscular endurance anaerobic capacity
3707.52,aerobic capacity and long duration
3710.16,endurance
3711.599,speed
3712.92,power and skill development
3715.44,have almost no benefit for fat loss
3718.5,because remember those are low weight
3722.339,a lot of rest and low volume
3725.4,they're not really really going to be
3726.839,helpful you can make a little bit of a
3728.579,case for strength
3730.26,a little bit but the total energy
3732.119,expenditure for strength training even
3734.099,if it's an hour if it's truly strength
3735.72,training it's fairly low because the
3737.579,repetitions are in the one to three
3738.9,range that's exactly it's not enough for
3740.4,total work so if you're trying to
3742.38,develop a protocol that sort of
3744.54,optimizes fat loss what you want to do
3747.059,you were close in my opinion is do a
3750.0,combination of something in the
3751.619,hypertrophy slash muscular endurance
3755.16,strength training realm okay so
3757.859,um six to Thirty repetitions something
3760.859,like that resistance training great
3762.599,deplete muscle glycogen maybe even a bit
3764.64,of liver glycogen maybe a little bit
3766.44,depending on if you're doing it for a
3767.52,long time but probably not a noticeable
3769.559,amount okay so an hour of of uh
3771.96,hypertrophy type training if you're
3773.7,training hard with low responsibils and
3775.079,you really did an hour you would for
3776.339,sure get there but most people don't
3777.839,because the reason why I crave large
3779.94,bowls of oatmeal and rice after I do
3781.619,weight training yeah and replenish
3783.059,muscle glycogen totally right
3785.579,um then you maybe do a little bit of
3788.46,very high intensity maximum heart rate
3790.98,well overview to Max uh hard as you can
3794.16,for 20 30 45 60 seconds something like
3798.0,that with some recovery
3799.619,a lot of recovery and repeated and
3801.96,that's going to do a great job of
3803.579,replenishing muscle glycogen right if
3806.16,you do that long enough you'll get the
3807.42,liver but again most people don't
3808.68,because it's really really hard to go
3810.78,that hard so liver is sort of last Last
3812.88,Resort yeah basic mechanics here which
3814.68,will which we'll actually get into as
3816.24,our like third segment here
3818.52,is
3819.68,energy production comes from the local
3822.599,exercising muscle first and foremost
3824.339,from phosphocreatine and carbohydrate
3826.74,stores right and so again and we store
3828.599,it in a muscle we call it glycogen right
3830.76,that's it's your first sign of light on
3832.44,defense if you need
3834.059,glucose outside of that you're going to
3835.799,start pulling it from the blood but one
3837.48,of the things your body regulates a
3838.799,handful of things over almost everything
3840.42,blood pH blood glucose blood pressure
3842.4,and electrolyte concentrations like it
3844.5,really does not want to mess with those
3845.64,things at all it will change almost
3847.2,anything else in the body to keep those
3848.76,things standardized right you generally
3851.7,because you need all those things for
3853.5,your brain to work and your brain will
3855.24,stop working right if you lose blood
3856.38,pressure it won't go up there pH changes
3858.359,you can't run metabolism electrolytes
3859.859,change you can't think and glucose is a
3862.5,primary fuel source for the brain it's
3864.359,going to be a problem right so if that
3866.4,number starts to come down because
3867.48,you're grabbing glucose out of the blood
3868.68,your liver is going to then kick in it's
3871.02,going to break down its glycogen to put
3872.94,glucose in the blood to keep the blood
3875.04,number the level in fact one of the
3876.599,things you'll see is blood glucose
3878.46,concentrations rise during exercise they
3881.579,don't fall in fact they rise as an
3884.16,anticipatory state if you train a lot
3885.599,your blood glucose will start going up
3887.04,before you start moving it knows it's
3888.72,coming right so you you can play that
3890.88,game you can rob Peter to pay Paul for a
3892.74,long time and tell your liver runs out
3894.66,and that's what actually is a bonk in
3896.579,terms of like long duration endurance
3898.02,stuff you're talking many many miles
3900.119,several hours typically we say oh it's
3901.98,got to be over two hours
3903.359,before your liver starts to become a
3905.099,real problem or it has to be
3906.599,tremendously intense because of those
3908.76,reasons you have to burn through just a
3910.859,lot of energy before your liver starts
3913.26,to get into a problem you can continue
3914.94,to train when your muscle glycogen
3916.38,levels are low
3917.52,in fact people say glycogen depletion
3920.099,and muscle but it's it's generally
3921.78,misnomer and you are going to have
3923.819,tremendous signals of fatigue when that
3925.68,number gets lower than 75 percent
3927.78,so people think that like their muscles
3929.22,are getting heavy you're probably still
3931.14,75 full a lot of folks will quit around
3934.14,the 50 the highest I've ever seen is
3936.599,like 95 true depletion and that's an
3939.24,extremely high level cross-country
3940.619,skiers and like they're deltoid it's
3942.359,very very low some very talented Runners
3944.64,will get fairly low in their quads but
3946.92,the vast majority of folks by the time
3948.54,you're 50 depleted you're gonna quit
3950.16,it's going to be really really
3951.66,challenging so you're never really going
3953.94,to get that low it's like a bit of a
3956.04,protective mechanism right but when your
3957.359,liver gets low
3958.859,you're going to be shut down and that's
3960.66,the case of if you've ever been to like
3962.04,a marathon and you've seen people run
3963.24,like 25 and a half miles and then they
3965.46,just like Bonk they go into like baby
3966.9,deers walking stands and then they
3968.64,collapse and you're like how are you
3970.26,mentally weak like you ran 26 miles and
3972.54,you can't run the last point it ain't
3974.099,mentally weak it is if your liver is
3975.839,done it's gonna stop you because there's
3977.76,no more backup reserves muscle you can
3979.859,get away with you can push through it
3981.839,liver will not let you go any farther I
3984.059,find this fascinating because it makes
3985.799,me wonder whether or not the liver being
3988.859,depleted sends a neural signal to the
3991.319,brain or the brain must register some
3993.9,signal like I would like to be alive
3996.0,tomorrow thank you whatever is happening
3998.4,right now
3999.839,um stopping is going to be safer than
4002.059,continuing yeah and so that stop signal
4005.42,um is is one that I think a lot of
4007.039,people including myself are are
4008.72,intrigued by because we always think
4010.039,that it's uh related to willpower but
4012.5,the brain needs to preserve itself and
4015.44,as the master computer I mean there are
4017.539,ways to go into kind of automaton type
4020.18,um you know not thinking just doing type
4022.28,uh Behavior you have override switches
4024.38,right and you can play those cards and
4026.299,you can get better at learning and be
4028.22,being less sensitive to that switch
4030.2,that's exactly what happened when you
4031.64,first start training right you start to
4033.559,realize like oh my gosh I'm super tired
4034.94,then you realize really quickly like oh
4036.079,I'm totally fine here and this is like
4037.76,the
4039.14,pick pick your person who's made sayings
4041.96,like this but it's like you're really
4043.22,only 10 percent depleted or 30 or 40 or
4046.76,something we're all operating 40 of what
4048.619,we could do of course any of those
4050.059,things are true because it is like a
4051.559,little bit of an override um you've just
4053.24,gotten very sensitive to being a small
4054.859,percentage depleted and you've learned
4056.539,okay I'm tired and there is a long way
4059.059,to go past that but once you get past
4061.76,that and you flip that override switch a
4063.74,lot
4064.88,um you just you're going to break
4066.14,quickly because you basically learn to
4068.48,ignore that signal and problems can
4070.7,happen really quickly after that and
4072.74,that's even experienced endurance
4074.66,athletes if you hit that level
4076.579,it's like you're going to be hitting the
4077.9,concrete next and that's you know
4079.94,potentially a problem
4081.14,I want to make sure I understand a
4083.299,concept that you referred to earlier
4084.74,correctly because I have a feeling that
4087.26,I don't and that's this issue of
4090.619,how the body accesses body fat stores
4096.62,when in a sub caloric State and I'm
4100.279,doing mainly glycogen burning exercise
4103.04,yeah
4104.54,what I heard you say and please correct
4107.239,me where I'm undoubtedly wrong
4110.6,what I heard you say was that okay I go
4113.779,into the gym and I start
4117.319,lifting weights I'm burning muscle
4119.66,glycogen mostly local to the muscles
4121.759,that I'm using and then I start pulling
4123.739,glycogen from the bloodstream
4125.719,maybe there's some
4127.4,body fat stores that are mobilized
4129.52,probably not dipping into my liver
4132.38,glycogen
4133.64,okay I complete the workout maybe I even
4135.98,hop on the air dime bike and do a little
4137.9,Sprint yeah go for a jog maybe
4140.719,um I eat immediately afterward maybe I
4143.239,don't eat for a few hours afterwards but
4144.98,across the day I ingest fewer calories
4148.06,than I burn
4152.12,is it the case that body fat is
4156.199,mobilized in order to replace the
4158.66,glycogen that my sub
4161.54,caloric intake
4163.4,was insufficient to provide in other
4165.679,words because I didn't eat enough to
4167.6,fill the glycogen stores
4169.819,am I using body fat
4172.04,converted into glycogen to fill those
4174.02,stores right
4175.819,and if so is that a case where I'm no
4179.12,longer exhaling carbons in order to burn
4182.239,body fat but rather I'm repurposing body
4184.46,fat into muscle have I turned fat into
4187.4,muscle in that case yeah I'm really glad
4189.679,uh you asked this because I did a very
4192.199,poor job on that last Point talking
4194.48,about earlier I'm realizing playing back
4197.0,in my head because that's so many really
4198.38,good questions you cannot turn fat into
4201.02,muscle
4201.8,can you turn muscle into fat no I'm so
4204.14,glad you said that because when I was in
4206.0,college yeah our I don't want to out
4209.36,that person the physiology teacher
4212.84,seem to think still at that point that
4215.48,one could lift weights get muscular but
4218.9,then it would eventually turn into body
4220.28,fat that that I that myth has I think
4222.5,largely been dispelled I heard that so
4224.6,many times
4225.739,as a kid I heard it so many times in
4228.26,college I heard it so I hear it so many
4229.88,times in our
4231.44,uh undergraduate students from other
4233.84,faculty and such so
4236.179,um no like they're not the same
4238.76,structures they are very different um
4241.159,let me take you out on answering this
4242.719,better you're really really close so
4245.12,yeah
4246.679,if you were to do that type of exercise
4248.239,where you've burned a lot of muscle
4249.56,glycogen how is it I'm losing stored fat
4252.8,right that's really the Crux of the
4254.719,question and it doesn't even actually
4255.86,matter if you then went ahead and
4258.199,ingested carbohydrates or fat post
4260.96,exercise
4262.159,that's not really a thing you hit on a
4264.32,couple of key things number one this is
4265.699,all under the assumption that total
4267.02,caloric intake
4268.52,is still low right you have a total need
4272.179,it's below okay
4274.34,I also want to flag calories in calories
4277.1,out is not the only thing that matters
4280.34,this is a very complex thing calories in
4282.8,is incredibly complicated calories out
4284.719,is even more complicated okay so we just
4287.62,maybe another series we can spend on
4290.719,that alone all right so don't don't go
4292.58,nuts about that
4294.02,you have to be hypocaloric one way or
4296.6,the other if you burn a bunch of muscle
4298.4,glycogen and you are hyper caloric
4300.679,you're still going to add fat
4302.9,if you burn a muscle glycogen and you're
4305.12,hypochloric you're going to lose fat
4307.1,right think about it this way
4310.1,you're in a negative calorie state
4312.92,where are those calories going to come
4314.54,from are you going to reduce your muscle
4316.58,glycogen storages permanently no no are
4319.82,you going to reduce your glycogen
4321.14,storage in your liver
4322.94,no you want to reduce blood glucose no
4325.58,no way right so where is that extra
4328.76,energy coming from it's coming from your
4331.04,stored fat it is your backup Reserve
4333.679,Energy System um the way that I want to
4335.659,fly this here is people tend to think
4337.64,about it as like carbohydrates versus
4339.56,fat that's not it's more like a chain
4342.08,more like a bicycle where there's a
4343.58,front gear and a back gear you turn one
4345.5,gear it turns the other one these are
4347.3,complementary systems they are not and
4349.58,or systems right you're turning one and
4352.219,when we go through carbohydrate
4353.48,metabolism maybe here in a second you'll
4356.179,understand why you have to have an
4358.04,anaerobic and an aerobic component to
4359.719,that there is absolutely no way to
4361.4,complete carbohydrate metabolism without
4363.44,oxygen that has to happen the only way
4367.159,to engage in fat metabolism is aerobic
4370.1,and oxygen there's no anaerobic
4371.42,component to it there's a fundamental
4373.04,difference there
4374.12,so the your carbohydrates are meant to
4377.179,be incredibly flexible it is the primary
4379.1,fuel source for a reason your fat is not
4381.5,meant to be flexible it is meant to be
4383.36,Unlimited that's the basic point so you
4386.96,want flexibility over here and an
4388.64,unlimited capacity over there now I'm
4390.62,safeguarded against any energetic need
4393.44,okay I need to run up a hill for safety
4396.739,cool carbohydrates are there I need to
4399.199,then run for 17 hours cool fat is there
4402.199,we want both of these systems you want
4404.96,to be able to have great energy
4405.98,throughout the day
4407.3,you want a slow drip coming from fat you
4409.94,don't want up and down up and down feel
4412.46,great up and down awesome you want to be
4414.62,able to think very quickly and get hyper
4416.179,focused boom carbohydrates ramp right up
4418.52,right get it into the brain get thinking
4419.96,better get thinking clearly fast so we
4421.699,want all these not just for exercise
4422.96,purposes for but for activities of daily
4424.94,living we want an optimal system here
4426.98,and when people use the terms like fat
4428.9,adapted they're generally hijacking that
4431.36,and they're thinking it used to be a
4433.28,thing we said all the time and like all
4435.62,of my undergraduate classes for years
4437.26,and that idea of metabolic flexibility
4440.659,is using optimal fuel sources and
4443.0,optimal types not maximizing fat usage
4445.159,the people have co-opted that term of
4447.679,metabolic flexibility to be like oh yeah
4449.12,yeah therefore learn how to maximize fat
4450.56,burning that's not what that term means
4451.88,that term means maximizing your ability
4454.159,to use whatever fuel is optimal in that
4455.84,time
4456.679,now I'll Grant you most people
4458.84,aren't fantastic and using fat as a fuel
4461.239,source relative to the other direction
4464.179,but nonetheless the the gold standard
4466.4,here should be maximizing both
4468.199,all right finally answering your
4469.58,question if I were to to burn a bunch of
4473.12,muscle glycogen how am I losing that fat
4475.159,well the fuel you're ingesting in that
4477.86,hypochloric state is going to say hey
4479.54,look we have a lot of muscle glycogen we
4482.06,have to replenish so any carbohydrate
4484.34,that comes in needs to be biased towards
4487.4,storage
4488.54,it's got to go into those tissue any fat
4491.659,that comes in or doesn't even come in
4494.0,but any fat that we're using for fuel
4495.86,needs to be utilized for activity
4499.219,and that's where the caloric expenditure
4501.14,from fat comes in so you're basically
4503.12,saying you're
4505.1,General physiology
4507.08,the energy for that starts coming from
4509.239,fat and the energy that's coming in from
4511.82,carbohydrate needs to be simply stored
4514.46,and so what you see is your respiratory
4516.02,quotient changes right the rer is going
4518.179,is going off and so in the exercise
4519.86,moment it shot way up for carbohydrates
4523.04,and shot way down for fat
4526.04,as the compensatory response it goes the
4528.62,other direction because your body's
4530.78,saying we are low on carbohydrates don't
4533.12,use them for fuel unless we absolutely
4535.88,have to right so use them for storage
4537.98,get our fuel
4539.84,from the fat side of the equation and so
4542.3,what you're generally going to say is
4543.62,like oh I'm burning more fat just
4545.84,sitting around
4547.219,after things like that and that's not
4548.96,even taking into the equation the epoch
4552.32,part which is like it's not actually as
4554.42,large as people think it is it's fairly
4556.159,small
4557.179,but it is it adds up sort of over time
4559.64,so um does that explain a little bit
4561.44,better about how you lose fat when you
4563.3,actually only burn carbs for exercise
4565.64,you explained it beautifully
4568.4,you talked about Epoch the post-exercise
4570.86,oxygen consumption yeah not being that
4573.5,significant in terms of energy
4575.3,utilization
4576.679,even though today we're talking about
4578.179,endurance and different forms of
4579.8,endurance I do have to ask whether or
4581.9,not people consider the
4584.9,elevation in basal metabolism that
4588.5,occurs when there's more muscle around
4590.96,yeah because muscle is such a
4592.94,metabolically demanding tissue
4595.28,um you know if is there a
4597.82,straightforward-ish equation you know if
4600.44,one adds one pound of of lean muscle
4603.679,tissue to their body even if it's
4605.78,distributed across multiple muscle
4607.34,groups does that equate to a caloric
4610.88,need of X number of calories per day and
4613.82,is that because of the muscle protein
4616.46,synthesis needs of that muscle or it's
4618.62,glycogen storage needs or both if you
4621.08,don't have enough muscle you start to
4623.179,have problems with fat loss it's
4624.8,difficult challenge if you have enough
4626.78,muscle and you're just trying to get
4628.94,extremely large if your ffmi is 24 and
4631.64,you're 15 body fat adding more muscles
4634.04,not really going to play a lot in the
4635.179,equation and here's why
4636.92,muscle is more metabolically active at
4640.46,rest than fat but fat is not inert so
4642.679,fat is still going to burn a small
4644.54,number of calories muscle burns more but
4647.0,it's not nearly what people think it is
4649.04,I'm a muscle guy I'm a muscle
4650.719,physiologist I would love to get people
4653.36,to have more muscle for any excuse I can
4656.3,it's not honest to say that though
4658.1,you're talking about when I was in
4660.86,undergraduate we would say numbers like
4662.659,50 Cake House per day per pound
4665.179,is what you can look at right so if you
4666.739,put on a pound of muscle spread across
4668.42,the body your basal metabolic rate would
4670.34,go up by around 50 calories per day
4673.52,I think that number is grossly
4674.9,exaggerated it's probably a tenth of
4677.36,that
4678.199,six to ten calories maybe um it's hard
4682.28,to know exactly what that number is but
4684.679,the more recent estimates are are
4686.06,something like that so now on one hand
4688.1,you could say oh my gosh that is not
4689.96,even meaningful the other hand you could
4691.159,say that's super meaningful it just
4692.84,depends on time domain you want to put
4694.58,that out right so if you were to put on
4695.96,five pounds of muscle and your basal
4698.54,metabolic rate went up 30 or 40 calories
4700.699,a day well over the course of a thousand
4702.98,days
4704.12,like that actually adds up so you you
4706.219,could slice this any way you want
4708.44,um now maybe that number somewhere in
4709.88,between I don't really know it's not a
4711.26,field I paid that much attention to
4713.12,candidly
4714.26,because it's not a metric kind of like
4716.239,epoch
4718.159,um where it's like we used to really
4720.199,harp on it and now it's sort of like wow
4722.239,maybe we exaggerated that like honestly
4724.64,just a bit but to me it doesn't change
4726.44,the equation much because if you don't
4728.3,have enough muscle as they describe
4729.8,there are other consequences that are
4731.239,going to make fat loss hard and so you
4733.699,need to have sufficient muscle
4736.699,if the additional caloric expenditure is
4739.4,the carrot great if it's something else
4742.1,I don't really care there's just enough
4744.14,evidence that you need to have it or I
4746.36,should say there's enough evidence that
4747.5,it will really help you in your path
4750.5,um maybe a few calories here there is
4752.54,not really the thing especially if you
4754.4,understand
4756.199,a normal food item
4758.659,anything you pick is going to be
4760.159,probably a couple of hundred calories
4762.82,one bad food Choice a day well out kick
4765.92,almost any amount of coverage you got on
4768.08,adding muscle mass to you so like
4770.36,you're really stepping over a dollar to
4772.28,pick up a dime if you're worried about
4773.84,how many calories you're getting from
4774.98,adding muscle
4776.48,um fat loss is going to be about
4777.44,regulating that carbon intake above and
4779.12,beyond anything else
4781.1,I'd like to take a brief break to
4782.9,acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker
4784.76,inside tracker is a personalized
4786.679,nutrition platform that analyzes data
4788.6,from your blood and DNA to help you
4790.699,better understand your body and help you
4792.32,reach your health goals I've long been a
4794.54,believer in getting regular blood work
4795.98,done for the simple reason that many of
4798.14,the factors that impact your immediate
4799.76,and long-term health and well-being can
4801.62,only be analyzed from a quality blood
4803.42,test one issue with a lot of blood tests
4805.159,and DNA tests out there however is that
4806.84,you get information back about various
4808.46,levels of lipids and hormones and
4810.02,metabolic factors Etc but you don't know
4812.239,what to do with that information inside
4813.98,tracker makes knowing what to do with
4815.48,all that information exceedingly easy
4817.46,they have a personalized platform that
4819.98,lets you see what your specific numbers
4821.659,are of course but then also what sorts
4823.94,of Behavioral do's and don'ts what sorts
4826.4,of nutritional changes what sorts of
4827.96,supplementation would allow you to bring
4829.699,those levels into the ranges that are
4831.56,optimal for you if you'd like to try
4833.42,inside tracker you can visit
4834.58,insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off
4837.8,any of inside tracker's plans again
4839.54,that's insidetracker.com huberman to get
4842.6,20 off so I've heard about this concept
4845.36,of metabolic flexibility mentioned a few
4847.4,times
4848.48,frankly you're the first person who's
4850.04,ever explained it to me in a clear and
4852.14,concise way how do I know if I am
4854.84,metabolically flexible and how do I
4858.44,increase my metabolic flexibility sure
4860.719,there's no specific standard which is
4864.8,actually a good thing right and so if
4867.86,you have a level of specificity that you
4870.86,want or need metabolically then you
4874.34,don't actually want to be in this Middle
4875.84,Ground an example would be if you are a
4879.86,performing in a type of exercise or an
4881.96,athlete who performs in a sport that is
4884.06,glycolically dominated you don't want to
4887.06,be optimally metabolically flexible you
4889.699,don't want to be super quote unquote fat
4891.26,adapted you want to be biased towards
4893.239,the energy you're going to use the same
4894.5,could be true for the other end of the
4895.88,spectrum so in those particular cases
4897.5,it's not optimal
4899.42,to be equally effective because there
4901.699,are no free passes in physiology right
4904.159,your
4906.86,energy producing systems
4909.08,will up regulator down regulate
4911.239,accordingly so you will actually limit
4912.86,your ability to say maximally utilized
4915.32,carbohydrate as a fuel if you're trying
4917.6,to up regulate your ability to use fat
4919.34,as a fuel and so this is like there's a
4921.38,saturation point
4923.12,outside of that Spectrum most people
4924.739,just say hey like I want to feel great
4926.12,throughout the day to be able to do a
4927.26,bunch of different things how do you
4928.46,know a couple things
4929.719,there's a lot of biological markers you
4931.64,can take there's also just some some
4934.04,practical takes now none of these
4936.44,markers
4937.699,by themselves are any sign what you want
4940.34,to do is probably a couple of them
4942.44,and then say okay this is maybe a clue
4944.54,so again it's really important to
4946.219,emphasize not a single one of these
4948.02,tests that I'm about to walk you through
4950.12,automatically means you can't use fat as
4952.4,a fuel or the other case which is maybe
4954.32,you're poor using carbohydrate as a fuel
4956.36,so disclaimers aside
4959.48,we'll get into a couple of them so
4961.76,should we think about these as
4964.04,informative and useful but not
4966.32,diagnostic exactly what we call this
4968.719,data inspired or data LED and not data
4971.659,driven
4972.739,right okay cool so number one you want
4975.56,to think about just overall
4976.88,functionality do you have a reasonable
4978.56,regulation of your energy throughout the
4980.48,day now many things could be going into
4982.46,this which is why these are not specific
4983.96,Diagnostics but as a basic measure we
4987.679,talked about blood glucose levels
4990.679,um you know a lot of people will say
4992.179,again you want that to be something like
4994.219,between 80 and 90
4996.5,um milligrams per deciliter is the blood
4998.0,glucose level and you can go look at the
4999.98,the cutoff points for what determines to
5002.739,be pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic Etc
5005.38,um what I can actually recommend um this
5007.06,is there's a little bit of science here
5008.679,actually that I'll walk you through but
5009.76,a lot of this is my personal preference
5012.76,um I generally want people to be at 85
5014.8,or lower and that's because of a couple
5016.84,of things number one there's actually
5018.82,some papers that showed any uh every
5021.64,single point increase
5023.679,above 85 increases your likelihood of
5026.92,developing type 2 diabetes by about 6
5029.02,percent
5030.46,okay great so technically while maybe 90
5032.739,or 95 or even up to 100 are you know in
5035.679,the quote-unquote normative values
5037.84,that's one clue again it's not
5040.239,definitive by itself doesn't mean
5042.28,anything
5043.42,you need to really pay attention to what
5045.58,increasing by six percent actually means
5049.06,but it's a data point where I'm looking
5051.1,at if I actually then see symptomology
5053.38,and we run you through maybe some
5055.0,questionnaires ask how you're feeling
5056.38,throughout the day and we see
5057.719,uncontrolled energy about so you're a
5059.739,lot of energy then get really really
5061.0,tired and swings okay another data point
5064.06,all right and we may patch a few of
5066.04,these things together that may give me
5067.78,some Clues
5069.82,um that being said
5071.92,again this a lot of this rhetoric is
5073.78,used to then scare people off of
5074.92,carbohydrates and that is I want to be
5076.659,as clear as possible that is not
5078.88,not truly
5080.8,um
5082.12,the only thing people should care about
5083.62,right it can be a thing that can also be
5086.08,unrelated there are reasons you could
5087.58,have blood glucose concentrations at
5089.679,this level or energy swings that are
5091.6,unrelated to carbohydrate ingestion at
5093.88,all
5094.54,all right so one test you can either run
5097.6,in addition to that if you're going to
5098.92,get blood glucose measured you can look
5100.48,at some markers we talked about earlier
5102.1,Richard AST and ALT what we talked about
5104.699,how you can kind of look at that AST to
5107.56,LT ratio before you can actually do the
5109.48,inverse which is look at alt and AST the
5112.6,kind of normative value there you're
5113.8,going to look at is like 0.8 I actually
5115.78,like to see it lower than that and that
5118.0,alone has been actually associated with
5119.92,blood glucose dysregulation and so if
5123.04,you've seen multiple of science again
5124.48,we're looking for patterns and patterns
5126.219,and patterns in both in our case
5128.159,biomarkers symptomology and performance
5131.38,and now you're if all three of those
5133.12,things are lining up you may have an
5135.28,issue so performance wise
5137.56,a couple of little tests you can run
5139.78,um ideally you have some sort of
5141.34,standard workout you do oh and hopefully
5143.38,it's it's pretty objective so in other
5145.42,words like uh I run the same 15 minute
5148.06,Loop every morning for my cardio okay
5150.159,great how long does it take you to run
5152.26,that Loop like you could pick whatever
5153.82,distance it doesn't really matter what's
5155.98,your heart rate during that thing and
5158.679,then what's your perceived exertion now
5160.9,you should be able to do that fasted
5164.08,with very little drop in performance
5167.199,okay if you can do that then that tells
5169.179,me you're fairly good at using a fat as
5171.88,a fuel source if however the one day you
5174.4,go to do your standard workout
5176.139,and you feel awful
5178.3,fasting that may be another clue that
5180.88,perhaps you're not very good at dialing
5182.56,in
5183.219,that system if your recovery afterwards
5185.62,in terms of heart rate recovery is very
5187.9,long it may be another clue that you
5190.9,have a poor utilization of fat as a fuel
5193.659,source the inverse can also be true
5196.42,so if I give you something in the
5198.4,neighborhood of like 50 or so grams of
5200.86,carbohydrate
5202.179,and 30 minutes later your face is
5204.1,falling off the table that's a good sign
5206.8,that you're in the opposite you're
5207.699,actually very very very poor utilizing
5209.92,carbohydrate as a fuel and the reason I
5211.48,bring that up is
5213.159,um that is equally a problem we send we
5215.08,hear people a lot make comments
5217.78,um like man I have to stay away from
5219.219,carbs I crash really hard if I do them
5221.44,that has a what that actually means is
5223.9,you're very poor at utilizing
5226.239,carbohydrates as fuel you're getting a
5228.58,your uh your sensitivity is way off we
5230.92,should be able to have carbohydrate at a
5233.32,reasonable dosage 50 grams and not fall
5236.26,asleep 30 minutes later or have to run
5238.54,to caffeine so that is a sign in our
5241.239,opinion this is again now just my
5243.4,practical brain telling you is that's a
5246.46,sign of dysfunction we should be able to
5249.28,have plenty of carbohydrates through the
5250.54,day if we choose to if we want to for
5252.219,any reason now of course if you were to
5255.159,throw 150 or 200 grams of carbohydrate
5257.86,in your belly
5259.06,you're probably going to take a little
5260.86,bit of an energy hit after that but we
5263.44,should be able to have a reasonable
5264.58,dosage and not you know have to fall
5266.38,asleep afterwards
5268.3,what is one way that people can enhance
5270.88,their utilization of carbohydrates uh
5274.659,for exercise the reason I ask is I think
5276.82,I fall into that category yep um I do
5280.139,consume some complex carbohydrates and
5282.699,fruit post
5284.38,resistance training and that tends to be
5287.199,when I'm hungriest for them but
5288.82,typically unless I'm I've just done some
5291.82,resistance training I keep most of my
5294.04,daytime meals relatively low
5296.26,carbohydrate and then in the evening I
5298.42,prefer slightly less protein and more
5300.88,carbohydrate because it has this effect
5303.28,of
5304.42,um sedating me a little bit yeah and I
5306.46,sleep well and I know this runs against
5307.9,what everyone was taught which is to not
5310.659,eat carbohydrates late in the day but I
5312.639,like it because then I tend to wake up
5313.9,in the morning
5314.92,with at least as far as I can tell my
5317.08,glycogen stores not necessarily topped
5319.42,off but but certainly filled yep um and
5323.199,I'm able to train fasted in the morning
5325.36,and my favorite pre-workout is consists
5328.78,of water and caffeine and electrolytes
5331.36,and maybe some supplementation as well
5333.1,but I love training fasted so there's
5335.62,actually a number of things um
5338.56,one little sneaky thing you threw in
5340.06,there is actually the use of caffeine so
5341.86,that's another sign if if you have to
5343.36,have caffeine to do your fasted training
5345.04,that's generally another sign you're not
5346.42,very good at using fuel so I use
5348.699,caffeine prior to resistance training
5350.92,workouts generally I don't need it for
5354.34,any kind of cardiovascular training yeah
5356.739,and when I say that it doesn't mean it's
5359.08,bad
5360.04,it's just like another clue that's like
5361.96,okay you should be able to do this
5363.82,without having to have caffeine to
5365.62,execute it now using caffeine to get a
5368.44,better result is sort of different as an
5370.42,ergogenic aid um we actually use
5373.78,a lot of high carbohydrate meals at the
5375.88,end of the day a lot of the times for
5377.02,our athletes who are cutting weight or
5378.88,trying to reduce weight so it is a
5380.08,fantastic way to handle a lot of things
5382.239,and that idea that if you eat carbs late
5383.86,at night
5384.82,that'll increase fat so like that's all
5386.92,is so old and so well destroyed
5390.6,scientifically that that's not a concern
5393.46,um there's just so much data showing in
5395.44,fact there's so much data on
5397.48,like eating timing is is uh generally
5400.9,poorly understood about when you can eat
5403.0,and what you can eat eating in the
5404.08,morning
5405.28,um versus eating at night like a lot of
5407.44,what we've heard in there is stuff in
5409.719,maybe we just saved that for sort of
5411.58,another day because we're going to get
5412.48,really far down that's about our weekend
5414.159,yeah but yes I think our plan is to
5416.5,cover that in an episode on nutrition
5419.08,um okay which is in this series the uh
5422.26,the only thing that would add to it is
5423.58,you know would you hear about ingesting
5425.739,carbohydrate late at night I should just
5427.719,say that uh at least in my case I'm
5429.639,eating the majority of my carbohydrate
5431.26,unless
5432.46,I trained yeah resistance trained early
5434.86,in the day and which guess I I post
5436.659,resistance training
5438.28,um in the last meal of the day but for
5441.159,me that's not really late at night that
5442.6,last meal is somewhere between 6 30 and
5444.82,7 30 p.m so it's three or so hours or
5447.46,something like that before we go to
5448.54,sleep around 10 10 30 or so yeah so it's
5450.639,not you know midnight uh bowls of pasta
5453.04,I've done that too but um but typically
5456.1,it's not so I think that um people will
5459.1,be very interested uh myself included in
5462.28,how meal timing relates to all of this
5464.44,but
5465.28,um yeah let's
5466.48,so how do you improve fat utilization
5469.179,how do you improve carbohydrate
5470.199,organization let's Hammer both out
5471.58,really quickly
5472.96,um enhancing fat uh utilization is as
5476.44,simple as doing a little bit of work in
5480.04,a
5480.88,either pre-fat ingested state
5483.58,so anytime you ingest a nutrient prior
5486.1,to training you're going to bias towards
5487.9,that nutrient
5489.58,right which is almost what we were
5491.32,talking about earlier so if you want to
5493.48,guarantee you burn more fat eat more fat
5495.4,prior to a workout now you're not going
5497.139,to lose fat but what you're what you're
5499.239,effectively signaling is we have an
5500.5,overabundance of this fuel
5502.739,preferentially Target this fuel
5505.84,now the downside is that may actually
5507.58,hinder your performance that's typically
5510.34,only a concern for people at a very high
5512.679,level
5513.58,um
5514.3,fat is a slower fuel source so if you're
5516.639,relying more upon that your top end is
5519.46,going to come down a little bit and so
5520.84,you wouldn't want to use that strategy
5522.4,prior to race if it is a carbohydrate
5525.28,dependent race
5526.9,all right and in fact we actually see
5528.52,long-term adaptations that would suggest
5530.08,that so the enzymes responsible for
5531.639,carbohydrate metabolism will down
5533.26,regulate and so you'll get worse at that
5535.6,so not not a great strategy there
5537.719,carbohydrate be the opposite right so if
5540.34,you have carbohydrate prior to exercise
5541.719,you're going to bias more towards that
5543.82,so a handful of things you can do
5546.34,if your total caloric intake is simply
5550.719,managed that's going to take care of a
5552.76,lot of these problems an appropriate
5554.8,eating strategy so the types of food the
5557.62,combinations of food
5559.139,all those things are going to make your
5562.9,post carbohydrate ingestion bunk a lot
5566.38,of those things can go away so there's a
5567.88,little bit of physiology that has to be
5570.06,corrected for so it's a little bit
5572.679,in one hand you can go very deep here
5574.42,right so the real answer of how we would
5576.28,do this is if we see a scenario like
5577.719,that we're going to do a whole set of
5579.46,analyzes we're going to go full Labs
5581.199,right probably extensive blood panel
5583.84,urine saliva stool even and we're going
5586.239,to figure out where is that glucose
5587.62,dysregulation coming from so a lot of
5590.08,people think like oh it's a metabolism
5591.699,issue it might be it also might just be
5594.34,a flag that something else is happening
5596.739,in the body so we're going to actually
5597.699,work backwards a lot to try to figure
5599.26,out exactly why that's occurring it may
5602.32,be as simple as oh you're eating a lot
5604.719,of your carbohydrates
5606.28,without any fiber or protein and we know
5609.219,that that's important because those will
5610.6,actually blunt the glycemic index like
5613.06,the rise in blood glucose so it could be
5614.56,a simple thing of just like oh your
5615.699,combination of food is doing it it's not
5617.739,the total amount um it may be something
5619.42,again more endogenous to the actual
5621.58,system
5622.719,uh it could be
5625.36,um a heart rate issue it could be a
5627.219,breathing issue there could be a number
5628.54,of things so the way to get better at it
5630.58,is to Simply train it and specificity is
5632.86,King here so if you want to get better
5635.08,at managing your blood glucose
5638.02,throughout the day so you're not feeling
5640.0,those things it could be a fuel issue
5642.04,but it could be a number of other things
5643.78,and it's just hard to go into all of
5645.34,them with within our time constraint so
5647.679,the Practical tool that I would say here
5649.3,is if you want to get better at managing
5652.179,energy throughout the day make sure that
5654.4,number one your protein is stabilized
5656.199,making sure number two you're ingesting
5658.239,your food in the right combinations
5660.219,ideally with some Fiber
5662.86,and or some protein or both that alone
5665.56,will help stabilize a lot of the
5667.6,problems then you need to train at a
5669.46,high intensity you want to get better at
5670.78,using carbohydrates as a fuel train at a
5673.06,higher intensity and have carbohydrates
5674.62,right before the workout we'll do that a
5677.199,lot if um
5679.179,uh if our if we see folks who are I kind
5681.94,of walk you through the test of
5682.78,identifying if you're not very good at
5684.1,using fat as a fuel the tests for not
5686.62,being good at using carbohydrate is the
5688.6,fuel is both that eating test I talked
5690.76,about as well as performance if you're a
5693.28,very very very slow starter it's just
5695.199,like really hard to get going that
5697.06,generally indicates
5698.38,you might be in a situation where you're
5700.179,not very good at using carbohydrates as
5701.62,a fuel so we're going to practice that
5703.12,we're going to have a pre-carbohydrate
5705.659,pre-exercise carbohydrate meal then
5707.5,we're going to do higher intensity stuff
5708.58,not the point of making you sick and
5710.44,digestive issues all that stuff but we
5711.76,want to get better at using
5712.78,carbohydrates as a fuel faster if you
5715.78,want to get better at doing the opposite
5717.219,then you do that opposite starter either
5719.08,again using the fat prior to the workout
5721.0,knowing
5722.56,your Peak Performance is going to go
5724.6,down a little bit but you're you're
5726.4,investing in adaptation right so it's
5728.56,not about that workout it's about what's
5729.94,going to happen six eight ten weeks from
5731.92,now investment is what you want to think
5733.659,about it or you could bring in some
5735.699,fasted training and so I want to really
5738.1,make sure I clarify when we were talking
5739.42,about it earlier I'm not at all against
5741.219,fasted training it's not it works it's
5744.94,just isn't required for fat loss it
5748.179,isn't required for fat adaptation it is
5751.78,a great option though if you want
5754.179,um what I was hoping to do with that
5755.62,conversation and maybe I didn't
5756.76,articulate that well is to not restrict
5759.1,people but is to open you up and they'll
5761.44,say you have a lot of options if you
5763.3,like to do fasted cardio amazing it is
5765.76,great if you hate it you don't have to
5767.8,you can reach the same performance goals
5770.32,the same physique goals without ever
5772.239,doing it if you love long duration
5774.699,steady state stuff it is great if you
5776.62,hate it there are other options higher
5779.44,intensity stuff again if we're just
5780.699,talking about fat loss so
5783.159,I hope now that that's a little clearer
5785.5,in terms of the same thing with
5786.94,nutrition if you like higher carb great
5788.98,if you like lower carb these are all
5790.6,great you have options and you don't
5792.1,have to fret so much over oh my gosh I
5794.86,have to do this thing a certain way and
5796.239,I absolutely hate it you don't have to
5797.92,worry about it hit those Concepts
5800.679,and you'll be fine
5802.9,a few minutes ago you mentioned that if
5805.3,we ingest a given macronutrient fat then
5808.42,the body will preferentially use that
5810.159,fuel source
5812.32,you ingest carbohydrate we'll use that
5814.36,fuel source
5816.1,is it always the case that the body uses
5818.92,the ingested macronutrient prior to
5821.86,using glycogen I have to imagine it's
5823.84,using both I mean if I were to have some
5826.42,carbohydrate be before
5829.0,um doing any kind of training the
5831.1,muscles still burn glycogen right or do
5833.739,they have some way to register the
5835.42,amount of circulating carbohydrate that
5837.82,would allow or available carbohydrate in
5839.8,the form of food stuffs uh that would
5843.46,allow them to not tap into their own
5846.28,muscle fiber stores with glycogen all
5848.38,right so the way we derive energy for
5850.9,exercise or basic maintenance a little
5853.9,bit about cellular physiology so you've
5855.46,got a couple of organelle and structures
5856.84,that we need to pay attention to the
5858.04,first one is the nucleus let's Hold You
5859.659,DNA the second one is the mitochondria
5862.179,and then everything outside of that
5863.32,you've got all these other organelle
5864.52,that do a bunch of things like ribosomes
5866.32,for protein synthesis etc etc all right
5868.78,now
5869.8,when you want to produce energy for
5872.139,exercise
5873.58,anytime you hear the word anaerobic you
5876.4,automatically understand we are meaning
5878.38,without oxygen
5880.3,all right great that all happens in the
5882.94,cytoplasm the cytoplasm is that space
5885.94,that is not the mitochondria not the
5889.3,nucleus so it's the space in between
5891.219,everything else this is like jelly-like
5893.5,substance that sounds there so anaerobic
5895.6,metabolism happens there every single
5899.28,aerobic
5901.239,metabolic process happens in the
5903.4,mitochondria
5904.96,all right why is that important
5907.0,if I go to create cellular energy and I
5909.52,need it the fastest possible I'm going
5911.44,to go for phospho creatine because it is
5913.42,stored directly in the cytoplasm the
5915.34,stoichiometric is one to one there which
5917.32,means for every mole of phosphocreatine
5919.48,I burn I can create one ATP it's one to
5922.48,one it is incredibly fast but it is very
5925.12,limited because think about how much of
5926.8,that could I possibly store in the small
5929.5,size of the cell that's it if I need
5932.56,energy past that point now I'll start
5934.96,using muscle glycogen
5937.06,because that is also stored in the
5939.4,cytoplasm so it is right there the
5941.44,Stoichiometry is not one to one it's a
5943.179,little bit higher probably like four to
5945.46,one so for every molecule of glycogen
5947.8,you burn you're going to get something
5948.88,like four ish some small number of ATP
5951.94,out of that which is great
5953.38,but again you're running into a storage
5955.179,problem how much can I possibly store
5957.699,inside a muscle cell it is very very
5960.1,fast much more effective than phosphor
5961.78,creatine but so there
5963.82,if I then want to metabolize any form of
5967.3,fat
5968.26,or if I want to complete the
5969.639,metabolization
5970.9,of carbohydrates I have to start
5972.76,transferring into the mitochondria now I
5975.699,start getting whole hosts of ATP if you
5978.76,were to fully run through this thing
5980.199,which I'll talk about in a second I'm
5982.0,called the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle
5984.46,you'll get now something like 28 or 30
5986.679,or 35 kind of depending
5989.5,ATP per so the energetic output is much
5993.1,higher
5994.12,okay so here's exactly what happens then
5995.92,I'm going to walk you through this in
5997.239,the form of carbohydrate and then I'll
5998.679,come backwards and go through fat
6002.28,so remember
6003.92,carbohydrate it is one carbon molecule
6006.54,that has been hydrated so it is one to
6009.179,one so the actual
6011.3,chemistry here it is
6013.56,C
6014.94,H2O
6016.56,one carbon two H one o glucose is a six
6020.639,carbon chain so the chemistry here is C6
6025.219,h12o6 six carbons six Waters very simple
6028.98,that's a carbohydrate all right so you
6031.86,can imagine if you're watching on the
6033.78,video here you'll you'll see my fingers
6035.28,going nuts I'll try to make sure I
6036.48,explain it to you all just listening in
6037.8,an easy fashion so you've got this chain
6039.6,of six carbons as in front of you and
6041.82,the very first step the metabolism is
6043.32,you snap that thing in half
6045.12,right so you break into two separate
6046.739,three carbon chains all right now in
6049.199,doing that you've got a little bit of
6050.699,energy because you broke that one Bond
6052.32,but not a tremendous amount this is
6054.36,called glycolysis so lysis being the
6057.48,split and you know glycoping like you
6059.46,split
6060.78,glycogen up got a little bit of energy
6062.94,of them
6063.96,all right you formed this three color
6066.0,carbon chain called pyruvate or pyruvic
6068.4,acid okay there's differences there but
6070.08,don't don't kill me
6071.28,General audience friends all right I
6073.139,gotta gotta give this communicate this
6074.58,to everybody
6075.9,so you got a little bit of that now you
6077.699,can't do much past that besides rip one
6080.1,more carbon off of each of those three
6082.44,carbon chains so I've got two three
6084.0,carbon chains I'd have to be careful how
6086.1,I do this with my finger so I don't flip
6087.719,you off here in a second but I burn one
6090.239,more off of each I get a little bit of
6092.82,energy and now that little two carbon
6094.679,chain I have two two concrete chains
6096.659,those are called acetyl-coa all right
6098.94,amazing I have now completed anaerobic
6101.52,glycolysis I've got really nothing left
6103.139,I can do here I made a little bit of ATP
6104.88,now wait a minute
6106.86,I have now freed
6109.8,two carbons because remember I started
6112.679,with six and I splited them apart but I
6114.0,didn't I had two three carbon chains I
6115.679,burned one each I've got two free
6117.42,floating carbons I have to now do
6120.119,something with them my body will not let
6122.28,me go through that part that last
6124.02,process unless I've got a plan for that
6126.239,free Carbon because I can't break it in
6127.98,half
6129.239,amazing here's what's going to happen
6132.6,if I have those three carbon molecules
6135.9,and I don't have anywhere I can put that
6138.42,carbon
6140.04,you're not going to go through that
6141.48,process
6142.92,it's going to stop it
6145.199,you're going to start building up
6146.219,pyruvate
6147.42,now at the same time you're breaking ATP
6150.659,for fuel that's called ATP hydrolysis
6153.719,right you have water that comes in you
6155.76,have a condensing and three phosphates
6157.619,that's why it's called ATP adenosine
6159.3,triphosphate one two three you break one
6161.94,of those phosphates off
6163.679,there you go there's your energy so now
6165.36,you have a free floating inorganic
6167.28,phosphate and an adenosine dye phosphate
6170.219,so two over there amazing that actually
6173.699,results because you use water for it
6176.639,results in a free-floating hydrogen ion
6180.719,okay just have to trust me hydrogen H2O
6184.32,any idea what a free floating hydrogen
6186.84,is
6188.219,um it's gonna
6189.84,that's acid yeah it says I was gonna say
6191.58,it's going to increase acidity that's
6193.02,what I said for anyone that's ever
6194.04,measured pH what you're really measuring
6195.659,is the the amount of hydrogen potential
6197.76,hydrogen that's what PH is Right 100
6199.92,there's two definitions of pH but you
6202.32,get that's one of the two so is this are
6204.119,you going to tell me this is related to
6205.5,the the burn
6207.48,we're going to get close right so I've
6210.9,got a bunch of free floating
6212.88,um you've got the phosphates which are
6214.139,actually a problem two probably more of
6216.179,a problem Than People realize and that
6218.46,hydrogen
6219.9,what are you going to do with that
6221.159,hydrogen well one thing you can do is
6223.139,actually ship it over to pyruvate and
6224.94,bond it there
6226.26,we have a special name for that little
6227.639,molecule when you have pyruvate and you
6229.08,have a hydrogen attached to it you know
6230.4,what it's called
6232.32,uh hydrogen peroxide lactate
6236.219,lactate lactic acid this is that whole
6238.92,system right again I'm skipping some
6241.44,steps making a little bit of mistakes
6243.179,here intentionally folks just to make
6245.1,this assumed so what happens when you
6246.9,start running a bunch of anaerobic
6248.159,glycolysis you start seeing massive
6249.96,rises in
6251.58,lactate
6252.96,cool not lactic acid right right
6257.46,that's why we see associations between a
6261.06,lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue but
6263.159,the lactate is actually not causing the
6264.9,fatigue the lactate is actually sparing
6266.82,you from having a bunch of free-floating
6268.26,acid
6270.54,it's also can be then used directly back
6273.48,in the muscle because as soon as you
6274.92,bring in enough oxygen
6276.96,and you can take that hydrogen back off
6278.76,of it you've now turned it right back
6279.96,into pyruvate you can run it through
6281.4,this whole cycle as fuel that I'm about
6283.739,to do you can actually actually ship it
6285.06,out of the exercising muscle and ship it
6287.34,into a non-exercising muscle and then go
6289.679,backwards and make glucose what actually
6291.84,liberates hydrogen from from lactate
6294.54,well you like chemically yeah so what
6296.699,what liberates uh what well what are the
6299.219,stimuli that can take hydrogen off the
6301.199,pyruvate yeah oh yeah and and then in
6304.8,other words to reduce lactate and free
6306.78,up that hydrogen oxygen availability
6309.78,so in fact one of the major places that
6311.94,you ship hydrogen to or one of the major
6313.86,places that you ship likely to is your
6315.179,heart
6316.26,because it's what we call like the
6317.76,ultimate slow touch fiber and it is has
6319.92,a ton of freely available mitochondria
6322.56,which have a ton of access to oxygen so
6325.02,it can actually then go to it form water
6328.679,the H2O can be used to form water and
6330.6,now we have a place to store the
6331.739,hydrogen
6332.699,got it right
6334.679,cool so
6336.42,as a result of anaerobic glycolysis
6339.179,we have made a little bit of ATP we've
6341.699,created a lot of waste and we don't have
6344.34,anywhere to to go with these end
6346.02,products
6347.219,so when you do anything of a higher
6349.8,intensity and it says I need energy fast
6352.92,you're going to go to this system first
6354.9,right right past ATP because it is the
6357.42,fastest place to get energy but you're
6358.679,not going to get much of it and you've
6359.76,got to deal with the waste products
6362.46,boom
6363.659,right back to the beginning of our
6364.98,conversation endurance is about two
6367.26,things energy production and waste
6369.36,management and we're right we're fatigue
6371.46,buffering this is it right how well can
6373.44,you handle the elevations in hydrogen
6375.84,right drop in PH and how and then what
6378.179,are you going to do with these products
6380.04,if you want to fully metabolize a
6382.5,carbohydrate you then have to take some
6385.02,do something with those pyruvates or
6386.76,those acetyl coase what you're going to
6388.619,do if oxygen is available you will take
6390.84,those things and ship them into the
6392.34,mitochondria
6393.78,they have to go through some cell walls
6396.0,and some other things like that but
6397.679,they're going to get inside there
6399.54,once they're in there that two carbon
6401.639,acetyl-coa runs through this entire
6403.86,cycle that we call the Krebs cycle
6406.26,that's this really interesting place
6407.699,that's where B6 and nmn people are like
6411.119,that's where that whole stuff starts to
6412.619,kick in all your B vitamins basically
6414.06,run that entire circle and you're going
6416.4,to start off the top you have a bunch of
6418.139,fun stuff going on but as a part of that
6420.9,Circle you're going to pull off some
6422.34,some of the hydrogen ions you're going
6423.659,to send these to What's called the
6424.5,electron transport chain that's where
6425.94,you're going to get a ton of ATP out of
6427.679,and as a result about halfway through
6429.78,the turn you're going to pull off one
6431.159,carbon and about halfway through the
6433.139,other almost the other way to the Finish
6434.4,you're going to pull off the second
6435.179,carbon so you're going to take the
6437.52,second acetyl-coa run that entire thing
6439.739,same through as well and so what we did
6442.199,is we started off with a six carbon
6443.88,glucose chain we split it in half we
6445.56,call those pyruvate made a little bit of
6447.3,energy because we broke that one Bond of
6449.1,those two carbons that are in the middle
6450.96,cool those two three carbon molecules we
6453.36,pulled one carbon off of each we brought
6456.0,in sorry we moved those into the
6458.219,mitochondria we brought one off we took
6460.44,a breath brought in some oxygen bonded
6462.719,that Brett took out two CO2 exhales we
6465.659,ran the acetyl-coa through the Krebs
6467.82,cycle one two carbons per turn coming
6472.02,out of CO2 so we had six carbons total
6474.3,as we started and we exited with zero
6476.159,carbons now we have fully metabolized a
6479.4,molecule of carbohydrate
6481.5,that required an anaerobic start and an
6484.98,aerobic finish
6486.9,if you don't have a lot of mitochondria
6490.32,large mitochondria high functioning
6492.179,mitochondria you're going to limit your
6494.4,anaerobic performance because you're
6495.78,going to get they're going to run that
6497.28,door full very very quickly you can't go
6500.34,past it because hydrogen will build up
6502.38,way too fast and one of the things that
6504.78,we know is both temperature and pH
6507.719,run enzyme function so they're going to
6511.02,stop you won't even be able to run
6512.34,through in fact that ATP hydrolysis
6514.26,phase even if I gave you a whole
6515.82,infinite supply of ATP if I put enough
6517.8,acid in there it would stop working
6519.06,because the ATP Ace enzyme needed to
6521.28,split it won't be able to run in a
6523.8,highly acidic environment or a hot
6525.36,environment yeah at some point perhaps
6527.699,today perhaps in a future discussion
6530.94,but still not too far from now we could
6533.4,talk about the role of temperature uh in
6535.44,the uh in pyruvate from in terms of its
6537.78,regulation muscle contraction but I want
6540.0,to make sure I understood something
6541.34,correctly you mentioned these these uh
6545.159,two parallel fuel systems right one is
6548.1,essentially anaerobic right and the
6551.52,other is aerobic you said that if we
6554.4,can't pull enough
6556.56,um if we can't break enough bonds then
6559.26,we limit our anaerobic capacity correct
6563.28,I would have thought given that uh the
6566.4,mitochondria or the site for essentially
6568.32,for aerobic metabolism that we would be
6571.44,limiting our aerobic capacity as well
6575.52,um perhaps you could just clarify for me
6577.08,how these two things are divided or is
6578.88,there not a clean division is it not an
6580.619,either No in fact again I think it's
6582.42,better to think of these things rather
6583.92,as two separate parallel things as one
6586.139,big cycle they're one gear turning the
6589.02,next being compromised in one will
6591.36,compromise the other that I should say
6594.239,reminds me of what you said earlier
6595.8,which is this the bicycle gear analogy
6598.44,that works uh great so if you if you
6600.42,short circuit one basically that the
6602.34,chain can't move that's yeah fantastic
6604.5,okay so um so indeed they they are
6607.199,running in parallel but they are
6610.26,um interdependent yeah well they're
6612.36,actually not even running in parallel
6613.8,because they're actually funneling to
6615.179,the same endpoint
6616.679,right which is like if you're going to
6618.659,come from the anaerobic glycolysis route
6620.28,or you're going to come from the fat
6621.48,route which I'll talk about in a second
6622.739,they're both going to be limited in the
6624.54,mitochondria
6626.04,so when that thing's full it doesn't
6627.3,matter you can't run either system
6629.88,right so it is more of like a again if
6632.46,you're running the bike gears it doesn't
6634.38,really matter if the back one's larger
6636.179,or smaller because if either one is
6638.1,limited your toast because they're
6639.3,running on the same system
6641.28,you can you can you can sneak a little
6643.08,bit here and there but but not much
6645.6,you also really nicely highlighted how
6648.02,lactate this thing that we think of as a
6651.3,a limiting factor like the burn it gets
6654.239,in the way and it's the thing we need to
6656.699,stop and buffer and all all sorts of
6659.1,things sure it's actually really a fuel
6661.44,it's a tremendously effective fuel it is
6664.139,a strongly preferred fuel actually the
6666.54,is this interesting this is a very
6668.04,classic case of Association
6671.159,um correlation versus causation right so
6673.38,the original actually like there's a
6674.699,really cool history on lactate but it
6676.02,was originally found uh I think in
6678.6,Germany
6680.219,um part of my history there
6682.92,um somewhere in Europe in hunted Stags
6685.679,so one of the things is they sort of
6686.88,realized is like if we if we if we
6688.619,harvested a stag in a rest estate when
6690.84,it didn't know we were there versus if
6692.159,we chased it and it was ran down that
6693.659,these lactate concentrations were
6695.1,significantly higher in in the latter
6696.78,situation therefore lactate started
6699.719,immediately getting this association
6701.1,between High fatigue points and it is
6703.38,easy to measure if you were to do any
6705.48,sort of lactate test any sort of
6707.52,metabolic test you will see as fatigue
6709.56,increases lactate will also increase the
6712.139,Assumption there was then oh my gosh
6714.6,is the cause now we know like again it's
6717.9,not the thing it's in large part trying
6720.179,to buffer
6721.82,the negative consequences of ATP
6724.5,hydrolysis and and some other things so
6726.42,it is certainly playing a part in that
6729.239,role but it is not the core driver it's
6731.28,also why you don't need to worry about
6732.48,doing things to quote unquote
6735.42,um
6736.139,reduce lactate in the muscle after
6738.239,exercise or to clear lactate or any of
6740.699,those things you may still want to do
6741.9,those activities but not for that reason
6744.02,lactate's fine you're actually going to
6745.8,use it in again the neighboring exercise
6747.619,muscle fibers in the same muscle another
6750.78,muscle you can send it actually to the
6752.82,to the liver and it can actually go
6754.56,through gluconeogenesis and it can
6756.119,actually replenish liver glycogen just
6759.42,does that feel sore sorry you sound
6760.56,harder any number of sources you can
6762.3,also just kind of put it in circulation
6763.619,put a back in the muscle and once enough
6765.6,oxygen is there you can just kick it
6767.4,right back into either glucose or
6768.96,glycogen it's totally fine so
6772.199,it is obviously clear though once that
6774.659,number gets very very high other things
6777.0,are going to be happening they're going
6778.08,to be causing a lot of hurt and this is
6780.6,your managing waste right it is really
6783.0,an issue of managing what am I going to
6784.98,do with all this extra carbon what am I
6787.199,going to do with all this extra
6787.98,inorganic phosphate and some other nasty
6790.56,byproducts but that's the thing you have
6792.84,to deal with
6794.04,I'd love for you to teach me how
6795.54,different ratios of fuel sources are
6797.52,used depending on how long I happen to
6799.86,be exercising
6801.3,for example if I do a very short bout of
6805.02,exercise yep typically that's correlated
6808.44,with a higher intensity output I mean I
6811.32,suppose I could jog for one minute but
6813.42,here I'm thinking about sprinting for
6815.1,one minute or less
6817.32,which fuels are used is that mainly
6819.48,driven by fat stores by carbohydrate
6823.02,stores is it driven by dietary fat
6825.42,preferentially or carbohydrate that I've
6827.94,ingested if indeed I've ingested those
6829.86,or protein for that matter
6831.96,and then as we transition to exercise
6834.96,that goes a little bit longer you know
6837.119,anywhere from you know three to five
6840.179,minutes how do those ratios change and
6843.48,as we transition to longer duration what
6846.48,most people think of as endurance
6847.679,exercise but long duration output of you
6850.56,know 20 minutes or more
6852.659,leading all the way up to a full
6853.98,Marathon how does that change the ratio
6856.44,of fuel sources that are used and I'd be
6859.139,particularly interested in
6860.52,distinguishing between
6862.58,carbohydrate fat and protein that's
6865.02,ingested so coming from food sources or
6868.739,carbohydrate fat and protein that are
6870.659,coming from Storage sites within the
6872.639,body okay great let's start at zero
6874.679,seconds and run all the way through
6875.76,Marathon
6876.78,and we'll we'll flag the distinctions
6879.0,where they start changing as soon as you
6880.98,want to create muscle contraction and
6883.199,power the very first source of energy is
6885.3,phosphoid creatine that's going to power
6886.98,you for zero to maybe say eight to
6889.86,Fifteen twenty seconds of maximal
6891.48,exertion and that's in coming from the
6893.639,muscle fibers themselves yeah that is
6895.26,actually stored in the What's called the
6896.58,cytoplasm so this is a little area of
6898.739,space in the muscle fiber that's sort of
6901.56,like in this jelly-like substance and
6903.36,it's nice because one molecule of
6905.699,phosphoid creatine gives you one
6907.139,molecule of ATP so it's not a big energy
6909.6,output but it's very fast because it is
6912.179,stored right there in the local
6913.56,exercising muscle right now if you need
6916.56,energy past that point say you know 10
6919.619,or 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of
6921.48,minutes this is now you're going to have
6923.52,to transition because you're going to
6924.48,burn through that phospho-creatine it's
6926.04,going to be out
6927.119,you're going to have to move to now
6928.56,carbohydrate metabolism this is what we
6930.48,call anaerobic glycolysis so there's two
6933.36,phases of glycolysis now glycolysis
6935.699,itself means glucose burning all right
6939.06,so this means we're using carbohydrate
6940.8,as a fuel source so initially when we
6943.32,start off this Cascade
6945.0,which is going to take us again for a
6946.98,couple of minutes
6948.679,carbohydrate utilization comes first
6951.06,from the exercising muscle so it's very
6953.28,similar to phosphocreatine that way
6955.44,if you start running low on it you can
6957.84,actually start pulling blood glucose and
6960.06,if blood glucose gets low you'll have to
6961.679,start getting glycogen from the liver to
6963.3,keep that up and we've sort of covered
6965.04,that conversation all right so a little
6966.54,bit of chemistry here just give me a
6968.4,little bit of room here so now remember
6970.739,a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule that
6973.08,has been hydrated so one carbon attached
6975.6,to one water and remember water is H2O
6978.38,most of the time when we're talking
6980.34,about glucose it is in the six carbon
6983.219,chain so six carbons attached to six
6986.34,water molecules all right great when I
6989.76,go to split this up through anaerobic
6991.32,glycolysis it works a little bit like
6992.94,this so you've got this six carbon chain
6996.06,the first step is to snap that thing in
6998.34,half you're going to make two three
7000.08,carbon chains now we broke one Bond
7002.659,right there so we got a little bit of
7004.219,energy but not a tremendous amount at
7006.56,the end of anaerobic glycolysis you're
7008.179,going to net something like three or
7010.34,four ATP so more than you get from the
7012.98,phosphate quadruple
7015.139,but still not very much there's another
7017.239,major downside that's coming in a second
7019.34,to this system the upside is it's fast
7022.94,now what actually one adaptation we get
7025.219,to training in this style
7027.44,is you'll increase your ability to store
7030.199,glycogen in your muscle
7032.3,which is great right we can actually
7033.739,biopsy you and measure the amount that
7035.36,you store in a training adaptation is
7037.099,awesome so you're able to sustain this
7039.44,system longer so perhaps 90 seconds into
7042.56,your interval training you hit a fatigue
7045.139,point and now you maybe can extend that
7047.0,to 100 or 115 seconds simply because
7048.98,you're storing more glycogen in the
7051.38,muscle
7052.34,before we have to and then go into the
7054.139,blood and get up in the form of glucose
7056.0,so that's great so we've got this six
7057.86,carbon molecule and we split this in
7059.659,half we got that little bit of ATP and
7061.52,now we're in this little tricky position
7064.639,because this three carbon molecule is
7067.159,what we call pyruvate pyruvic acid and
7069.5,again chemistry folks I'm skipping some
7072.38,steps I'm going to intentionally make
7073.699,some mistakes here I'm making sure the
7075.739,entire world listening regardless of
7077.9,where they come in can follow me here
7079.52,okay so don't burn me on the details
7082.28,right you've got this pyruvate the
7084.44,problem is you can no longer do anything
7086.239,with that glycolysis is over you've got
7088.88,to make a choice
7090.08,right in order to make something out of
7092.78,those three carbon molecules you've got
7094.159,to ship them to the mitochondria as we
7096.02,said that is the only place of aerobic
7098.719,metabolism
7100.099,right we cannot do aerobic metabolism
7101.96,anywhere else until we enter the
7103.34,mitochondria so anytime we cross that
7104.9,barrier we know we've automatically
7106.34,switched from anaerobic to aerobic well
7108.26,here's the problem
7110.0,if you were to take one more carbon off
7112.76,that three carbon pyruvate you have to
7115.52,now do something with that carbon waste
7118.88,okay so before when we split the six
7120.98,carbon chain we didn't actually leave
7122.84,any carbons free floating we just split
7125.179,a two molecule in half
7126.92,when we go to split from pyruvate and
7129.139,make it into this two carbon molecule
7130.46,called acetyl-coa or seal COA now we've
7133.4,got a free-floating carbon
7135.44,we have to have a strategy for that
7136.82,because that's going to increase the
7137.84,acidity level any enzyme in our body
7139.88,that works to create fuel
7142.099,is very pH sensitive right so if this
7146.239,thing if pH gets off either high or low
7148.52,these enzymes can't work and that's
7149.96,really really important because even if
7151.34,I were to give you a direct injection of
7152.96,ATP remember that's that energy currency
7155.06,that's the only way we can actually form
7157.04,energy I guess remember to clarify
7159.44,anytime we're using phosphoid creatine
7161.96,or glucose or fat which we'll get to a
7164.0,second we're not actually getting energy
7165.5,for exercise by breaking those down or
7168.38,getting energy that we can use to then
7170.119,make ATP we break that ATP down that's
7172.639,what's actually powering muscle
7173.719,contraction
7174.8,um you can go back to our previous
7175.82,episode where we'll walk you through the
7177.199,detail of the muscle contraction but
7179.659,that's what we're after okay
7181.4,so in the case of pyruvate if we split
7185.0,that off we have got to deal with that
7186.44,and the only way in the best way we can
7188.239,deal with that is oxygen remember we're
7190.099,going to breathe in O2 that O2 is going
7192.619,to combine with that free-floating
7194.119,carbon makes CO2 we're going to Exhale
7195.86,that thing out that's our Waste
7197.9,Management strategy
7199.219,but
7200.659,that has to happen in the mitochondria
7203.179,remember if we're using oxygen it has to
7205.699,be in the mitochondria so if we have the
7208.76,ability to ship pyruvate into the
7211.34,mitochondria
7212.719,or golden
7214.46,but what happens if we don't
7216.92,why do we not well if we don't have
7219.32,enough mitochondria or mitochondria are
7221.42,too small or they're too far away
7223.76,or we don't have sufficient oxygen
7226.099,availability
7227.179,why don't we have sufficient oxygen
7228.98,availability because we created the
7230.54,pyruvate too fast
7232.699,and the demand in the mitochondria is
7235.699,exceeded by the buildup of pyruvate and
7238.699,so now we're having this giant backlog
7240.739,and this thing fills up fast
7243.139,we have a couple of strategies here
7246.08,well when you're going through ATP and
7248.179,you're splitting it's called hcp
7249.5,hydrolysis
7250.82,in of doing that remember ATP is a
7253.94,adenosine molecule and then the T part
7256.04,is triphosphate one two three which
7258.139,means you have three phosphates attached
7259.94,to the end when you break that phosphate
7262.28,off that's where you get your energy so
7263.659,now you have an inorganic phosphate and
7265.88,an ADP it doesn't diphosphate two
7269.619,that process requires water it's called
7272.9,hydrolysis as a result of that you then
7275.48,have a free floating hydrogen and as you
7278.54,well know that is acid right that's
7280.94,potential hydrogen that's what that
7282.619,means and so you've increased the
7285.02,acidity in the muscle by breaking up all
7287.96,this ATP and so oh we're building up
7291.38,acid we have building up pyruvate we
7294.02,don't have nowhere to go with it and we
7296.119,can't cleave off a carbon because now
7298.76,we're just going to exacerbate
7300.679,the acid increase
7303.02,so what we can do is we can take those
7304.76,hydrogens that we're building up and
7306.199,store them on the pyruvate a pyruvate
7308.9,that's holding an extra acid has a
7310.76,special name and we call that lactate
7313.46,all right so that's why we see this
7315.26,buildup of lactase so one of the
7316.82,downsides of anaerobic glycolysis is an
7319.94,incredibly High rate of waste production
7324.02,now lactate is not the cause of fatigue
7328.88,in fact if you think a little bit more
7330.38,carefully about what I just said it's
7332.119,actually stopping you it's what we call
7333.86,a acid buffer
7335.719,you can actually use it for a bunch of
7337.099,other things you can ship it to a
7338.36,neighboring muscle fiber in the same
7339.98,muscle that's not working you can ship
7341.599,it to the liver you can ship it to the
7342.86,heart and a bunch of other places and
7344.719,then you can actually just work
7345.5,backwards so if you ship it to for
7347.239,example the heart and it's got a bunch
7348.5,of mitochondria that are free you can
7350.48,bring in the oxygen
7352.28,attach it to that hydrogen make water
7354.26,and now you're right back to pyruvate
7356.06,you put two pyruvate back together and
7357.739,now you just make glucose so you can
7359.48,actually store it in the liver this is a
7361.46,process called gluconeogenesis through
7363.86,this fancy thing called the Corey cycle
7365.3,which is what the the proper cycle here
7368.48,is
7369.44,so you can use it as a very potent fuel
7371.06,source in fact a lactate is a
7372.679,tremendously valuable fuel source I'm
7374.719,not like for exercise but for cognition
7376.46,and a bunch of other things so lactase
7378.8,in fact this is why um if you've seen
7381.44,the research about
7383.38,pre-exam testing exercise uh you'll see
7386.659,a noticeable increase in exam scores if
7388.34,you do a 20 minute about of exercise
7389.54,prior to taking the exam and it's
7392.06,largely in part probably because of
7394.219,things like elevations and lactate how
7396.8,intense of exercise uh would be most
7399.98,beneficial I don't know that exact
7401.96,answer I just know that generally any
7404.719,form of exercise is good but if you were
7406.4,to reach a reasonably high heart rate
7407.84,you're probably going to see in fact
7409.4,there's an acute and chronic adaptation
7410.96,here so Folks at exercise have better
7413.599,memory memory retention scores and exams
7416.42,Etc but then also doing it prior to that
7418.88,exam make sure you recovered and rested
7421.159,back down the street but you'll
7422.36,generally perform better previous guests
7424.159,on the huberman Lab podcast who's the
7426.679,who's a psychology professor and
7429.08,neuroscientist and also dean of College
7430.699,of Arts and Sciences at New York
7432.56,University NYU Wendy Suzuki is religious
7436.52,about
7437.619,daily morning exercise yeah specifically
7440.719,for this purpose of enhancing learning
7442.46,and memory and has a lot of really
7444.26,beautiful data I consider one of the
7446.36,real Pioneers in this space
7448.82,um so if people want to learn more they
7450.619,can look to that episode or Wendy's work
7452.3,we can provide a link to a couple of the
7454.34,papers but
7456.86,this is fantastic in that it's
7458.599,incredibly clear I think for the first
7460.159,time I'm understanding what what lactate
7463.159,is really doing yeah
7464.9,um and it's dispelling a lot of myths
7467.0,that I think I and a lot of other people
7469.28,arrive to the discussion about lactate
7471.619,with
7472.76,what happens when the bout of exercise
7476.119,extends longer amazing so if we want to
7480.739,continue past that point we have to have
7483.02,some sort of strategy to get through it
7485.0,right we're stuck we're out of gas we
7487.639,have to then ship it to the mitochondria
7489.199,and now we're going to enter what's
7490.4,called aerobic glycolysis and this is
7492.98,going to take us anywhere from again say
7495.32,that 90 seconds of all that work up to
7498.32,really 20 30 minutes in fact it really
7500.06,will take us to unlimited if you look at
7502.94,a highly competitive marathon runner
7504.86,even those that are running say your two
7506.599,hour marathon those folks are burning up
7508.76,to 80 carbohydrate
7510.8,it is a it it is not a fat burning thing
7514.28,and the reason is fat metabolism is way
7516.619,too slow it provides a lot of energy but
7519.139,it is incredibly slow if you're trying
7521.0,to run a four and a half or so minute
7522.92,mile repeated 26 times you have to be
7526.04,moving fast are they ingesting
7528.159,carbohydrate as a fuel source during the
7530.9,race
7532.699,unless you're on the team you don't know
7534.32,they won't really tell you these are
7536.179,sort of Trade Secrets
7538.099,um it would be I would say fairly rare
7540.8,to not have something right there's a
7542.9,bunch of different strategies if you're
7544.04,going to go really long like some of
7546.26,these um like cycling where the races
7548.54,will be several hours then you actually
7550.88,might go to some fat as fuel sources I I
7554.0,know a lot of cyclists are using ketones
7556.52,and things like that now but
7558.02,traditionally most endurance folks are
7559.82,going to buy us heavily towards
7560.84,carbohydrate
7562.46,um
7563.239,now
7564.679,in one respect
7566.179,you're not going to run out of
7567.56,carbohydrates
7568.76,until you're many hours in these folks
7571.28,are a unique case but the average
7572.84,individual who's doing an hour hour and
7575.54,a half cardio even you're not going to
7577.52,be limited by your carbohydrate stores
7579.98,you're going to be just fine you're
7581.54,gonna be limited by some other things
7582.8,which will maybe sort of break down here
7584.36,in a second
7585.56,but you're going to be fine there a lot
7587.48,of those folks will take carbohydrate
7589.34,they'll have very specific intervals you
7590.84,want to you do want to be careful though
7592.46,of ingesting too many fast carbohydrates
7595.84,prior to your exercise spout um we
7599.119,actually have this little thing that's
7600.26,called the insulin glucose double whammy
7602.9,and what that means is when you ingest
7605.54,carbohydrates immediately your blood
7607.639,glucose goes up and that's depending on
7609.739,the type of carbohydrate and things like
7611.119,that well the same thing happens with
7612.8,exercise and so what happens is insulin
7615.619,wants to start pulling glucose out of
7617.42,the blood at the same time muscle wants
7619.28,to start pulling glucose out of the
7620.54,blood and so we have this giant bolus of
7622.46,carbohydrate come in and then all of a
7623.84,sudden our blood sugar crashes
7626.48,and so if you're going to be doing so
7628.639,your your first half marathon or
7630.679,something like that and you're in those
7632.3,giant Corrals where there's like you
7633.92,know 100 people waiting to go and you're
7635.36,standing there for 45 minutes you may or
7637.94,may not want to slug down like three or
7639.679,four bananas in a bagel and and honey
7641.96,and things like you probably don't need
7644.179,that now not everyone experiences this
7646.52,double whammy but it has been shown in
7648.679,literature to happen to some people so
7650.06,you want to just be a little bit careful
7652.46,um an easy way to combat that is just
7654.38,practice exactly what you're going to do
7656.78,in your race in your training that's
7659.0,like the simplest advice ever but you'd
7660.739,be stunned how many people do things uh
7663.5,during the race that they've actually
7664.4,never done in training I suggest people
7665.9,do exactly what you describe also for
7668.78,any kind of cognitive testing of course
7671.0,before a big exam is not the time to
7673.04,discover whether or not you can handle
7674.54,twice as much espresso or take a
7676.88,nootropic for the first time or no uh or
7680.3,change anything I mean if if indeed the
7682.58,the score on that exam is is Meaningful
7684.44,to you you keep keep things regular so
7686.96,to recap what we've done here is we
7688.58,started off in the cytoplasm with this
7690.619,glucose molecule that is six carbons we
7692.36,took that thing we split it in half we
7694.219,call that thing anaerobic glycolysis we
7695.9,made a little bit of energy but not much
7698.0,we take those three carbon molecules we
7699.739,ship them into the mitochondria we take
7701.719,each one of those we clear off one
7703.219,carbon each those carbons we take a
7705.739,breath in we attach them to oxygen we
7707.54,exhale them get rid of that energy we
7709.639,are now fully into aerobic glycolysis
7712.099,each one of those two carbon molecules
7713.96,we run through the Krebs cycle
7716.36,each round the Krebs cycle Burns one two
7719.0,carbons so we go one two one two and now
7722.239,we've gone from six carbon molecule all
7724.219,the way down to zero we used the
7726.26,hydrogens that we pulled off of that
7727.94,Krebs cycle run to go to the electron
7729.98,transport chain from there we made a
7731.659,whole bunch of ATP and so we have now
7733.88,fully metabolized one molecule of
7735.739,carbohydrate and the end product of all
7737.719,of it is simply ATP water and CO2
7743.06,beautiful
7744.679,and leads me to
7747.56,the conclusion that most everything is
7750.679,really about
7752.0,utilization of carbons and exhaling CO2
7756.02,is that how I should think about
7757.46,bookending what you just described this
7759.739,is why we started off the conversation
7761.179,with the circle of life
7763.04,this is really a carbon game this is why
7765.199,we call Chemistry with carbon organic
7768.44,chemistry right that's what this whole
7770.48,thing is about any living being has to
7773.9,run through metabolism
7775.4,it's all a carbon game
7777.44,any living being has to use ATP this is
7780.44,all just a big fancy game of how do I
7782.96,make ATP and handle the waste remember
7785.599,endurance is all about Waste Management
7788.739,fatigue resistance the same thing
7791.42,and energy production we're playing a
7793.88,game here
7794.84,the whole game
7796.58,bring in energy use it
7798.56,mitigate waste products
7800.54,so when thinking about aerobic exercise
7802.34,or long duration exercise
7804.56,in this case anything longer than five
7806.659,minutes for that matter five minutes all
7808.46,the way up to an ultra marathon
7812.42,the breathing associated with endurance
7814.52,exercise the heart beating which of
7817.04,course is associated with the breathing
7818.06,and vice versa
7819.92,it's really all about bringing oxygen
7822.199,into the system that then allows those
7825.02,carbons to be used and
7828.199,within the mitochondria specifically and
7831.02,then carbon dioxide to be exhaled as we
7834.8,work through the carbons of the sort of
7836.659,beads on a string is that right unless
7839.42,you're moving incredibly fast for a very
7841.699,long time and we're talking probably
7843.26,north of 90 minutes
7846.02,endurance is really not a game of making
7849.38,sure I have enough fuel it is simply
7851.9,managing the waste production
7854.179,and that's exactly what you described
7855.739,you need to bring in the oxygen so you
7857.96,can handle the carbon that's building up
7859.46,as a result of both the anaerobic
7861.4,anaerobic glycolysis
7863.599,that's our game here
7865.34,if we start talking about endurance
7866.96,events longer than that now we do have
7869.06,to start worrying about running out of
7870.44,muscle glycogen running out of liver
7872.179,glycogen
7873.26,Etc or if we are at that two hour mark
7875.06,or so and we're moving very very very
7876.44,fast but anything south of that is just
7880.04,managing carbon buildup
7882.86,and we do that best through oxygen
7884.54,utilization or
7886.159,getting more efficient having a higher
7888.5,capacity for our anaerobic side
7891.139,so we can do that by having either more
7893.06,glycogen in our muscle
7894.98,so that lasts longer or building better
7898.179,asset buffering systems and there's a
7901.4,whole line of supplementation that are
7903.139,specifically acid buffers there's a
7905.06,whole line of training there's a whole
7906.92,line of breathing to manage this that so
7909.38,we have a lot of strategies where we can
7911.42,maximize endurance all we have to do
7913.94,is go back to the earlier part of our
7915.8,talk which is figure out what's the
7918.26,actual limiting step
7920.0,and then train according to that or do
7923.06,your strategy your nutrition your
7924.98,supplementation that defeats that
7926.96,limiting factor for an example if you're
7930.139,trying to maximize your performance in
7932.659,this 20 second maximal burst and your
7936.44,strategy for that was to make sure your
7938.179,muscle glycogen is saturated
7940.46,it's probably not going to help a ton
7942.56,because you're not going to be limited
7943.94,by total fuel you're going to be limited
7945.739,by your ability to buffer acid however
7949.04,storing more glycogen in your muscle in
7951.739,preparation for a marathon is a
7953.599,tremendously effective strategy because
7955.52,that will become a limiting factor so
7958.159,what we can do actually next if you'd
7959.9,like is we can just walk through these
7961.4,and look at the individual limitations
7962.96,where the failure Point happens and that
7965.719,effectively will outline your strategy
7967.88,for improving them so you taught us
7970.4,about carbohydrate utilization as a fuel
7972.619,source
7973.579,what about fat and what about protein
7976.04,great I'll start with protein because
7978.98,it's easy it is
7980.78,generally at best going to represent 10
7983.48,percent
7984.44,of your energy output now that will grow
7986.84,over time in terms of if you did a
7989.719,several hour lot of exercise when you
7992.719,started doing it you might be using five
7994.46,percent of your energy from protein and
7996.079,then in that micro to 10 or so and that
7999.26,happens because you start running low on
8001.36,muscle glycogen you start running low on
8004.0,liver glycogen
8005.44,you start then having to pull in energy
8007.659,from another place so like as those
8009.28,numbers go down you'll see an increased
8011.38,uptick of energy from fat as well as
8014.44,protein having said that it's not a
8017.32,tremendous fuel source it is only
8019.54,aerobic so it has to be oxidized those
8022.78,are the same thing when I say oxidized
8024.82,you use oxygen to burn something to make
8028.119,a fuel
8029.44,um so it's not a significant contributor
8031.54,to energy in that regard and unless
8034.42,you're talking ultramarathons are longer
8036.28,and it is also not something that can
8038.32,enhance performance and so we don't
8040.719,really need to talk much more about it
8041.98,than that in terms of fat as a fuel
8044.8,source now here's the fundamental
8047.619,difference while carbohydrate starts
8050.32,anaerobically and finishes aerobically
8052.84,in the mitochondria you're using mostly
8055.54,the carbohydrate in the exercising
8057.699,muscle tissue
8059.32,eventually you can pull from blood and
8061.42,then you can pull from the liver with
8063.159,fat you have a tiny amount stored in the
8065.8,muscle intramuscular triglycerides but
8067.78,the overwhelming majority of fuel you
8069.94,get from fat comes systemically
8073.36,and so now we have a fundamental
8074.619,difference we actually literally have a
8076.42,Time problem I can get energy from
8079.54,carbohydrates faster because it is
8081.28,directly there if I go to pull it from
8083.32,fat I've got to pull it from the rest of
8084.94,the body which is why somebody who loses
8087.579,fat loses it from their entire body
8090.219,despite the fact that they may be only
8092.199,exercising a couple of parts so think
8094.96,about a runner someone who lost a lot of
8097.239,fat or running you don't see them just
8099.579,lose fat in their legs it comes from
8101.5,their face and their neck and everywhere
8103.06,why because what you're going to do is
8104.8,pull fat from the entire system you're
8107.619,going to break it down through a process
8109.0,called lipolysis
8110.5,which means you break it down from the
8112.06,stored form you put it in the blood as
8114.34,that glycerol backbone which is that
8115.96,three carbon backbone
8117.699,in the individual fatty acids it's going
8120.04,to float through the blood there's a
8121.239,seven step system here but we'll skip it
8123.159,for now it's going to have to get then
8124.78,uptaken into the muscle in the muscle
8127.06,then it has to get taken up and run into
8128.98,the mitochondria now
8130.84,that backbone that three carbon glycerol
8133.54,backbone is actually going to function
8135.34,almost exactly like the three carbon
8137.079,pyruvate just get it into the
8138.76,mitochondria cleave off one carbon run
8141.219,it as acetylch
8142.739,exact same thing super easy to
8145.0,metabolize small enough to go through
8146.44,the mitochondrial membrane the fatty
8149.02,acid chains become a problem
8151.0,so if you have a chain that's longer
8153.46,than or eight or so carbons
8156.219,it has to actually go through a special
8158.02,transporter on the cell wall to get in
8160.06,and that's going to be limited by a
8161.739,thing called carnitine
8163.36,and you're probably familiar with that
8164.679,as a supplement you may have talked
8166.42,about it there's a lot of places that
8167.619,make it that's going to be a limiting
8170.199,factor if it is a smaller what we call a
8173.38,short chain or even a medium chain
8175.92,triglyceride which a lot of folks have
8177.639,heard of MCT that's what we're talking
8179.739,about that can actually go directly
8181.3,through because it's small enough to
8182.86,pass through and you can use it
8184.36,immediately as an energy source in
8186.159,either case the way that you finally
8188.38,metabolize a fatty acid is a process
8191.44,where you would go through and cut off
8193.12,two carbons
8194.62,at a time why would you cut off too
8197.139,because you're trying to make that two
8199.059,carbon acetyl COA so you can run through
8201.219,that Krebs cycle again
8203.5,because you're cutting off two carbons
8205.479,at a time we have a special name for
8207.399,that oxidation process it's called beta
8211.059,oxidation that's exactly why we call it
8213.399,beta oxidation
8215.019,two carbons in you cut it off to make
8216.939,that acetalkoa so you can notice the
8219.34,oxidation pathway the electron transport
8221.62,pathway is identical whether you're
8224.559,talking about the carbohydrates or the
8226.899,fat in fact it doesn't even matter
8229.0,more to our point if we're talking about
8231.04,simply fat loss it really just is about
8234.399,running that electron transport chain
8236.08,whether it came from a carbohydrate or
8238.479,original Source or a fat original Source
8241.059,it ends up in the mitochondria as
8243.219,basically the exact same thing it then
8245.92,ends the end of metabolism as the same
8248.979,thing remember the final endpoint
8251.679,of carbohydrate metabolism is water ATP
8254.979,and CO2 do you want to guess the final
8257.62,endpoint of fat metabolism
8260.139,water
8261.34,ATP and CO2
8265.899,so
8266.979,practical applications here
8269.32,if you want to maximize fat loss what
8271.66,type of training is best
8273.639,it really doesn't matter
8275.74,if you enjoy longer steady state stuff
8277.719,fantastic if you enjoy intervals amazing
8280.359,if you would like to do a combination
8281.88,that's my personal preference that's
8284.5,great too you have a ton of options pick
8287.8,what you think is a combination of
8289.84,challenging
8291.7,not all exercise should be easy but you
8294.34,will actually enjoy someone or you're
8296.08,willing to accept
8297.519,and anything that you absolutely hate
8299.139,don't do it sometimes is very very very
8302.439,difficult to do high intensity training
8305.08,you have to really be interested in
8306.34,doing it if not it ends up turning into
8307.84,like moderate intensity training you
8309.939,sort of just check the box and it
8311.62,doesn't work that well if you're just
8312.76,checking the box so if you're like man
8314.8,mentally I don't have it in me today to
8317.139,get to a high heart rate and throw up
8319.12,and all that stuff cool but you can just
8321.46,do some moderate steady state stuff well
8323.38,that's a win great if you're like oh my
8325.899,gosh more than 10 straight minutes and
8327.939,I'm so bored and you're all maybe you're
8330.939,also like I don't have 45 minutes I got
8332.679,to get this done in eight minutes great
8334.3,go do some high intense intervals either
8336.7,option will be equally effective
8338.92,as you mentioned earlier
8341.08,exercise is useful for aesthetic changes
8343.54,functionality
8345.519,and for longevity
8348.58,but when thinking about exercise
8350.08,specifically for fat loss
8352.899,I do have to ask this question
8354.82,I often hear from people that they
8356.8,prefer one type of exercise versus
8358.42,another
8359.62,for sake of fat loss because certain
8361.599,forms of exercise make them very hungry
8364.139,I'm wondering whether or not there's any
8366.219,relationship between the intensity or
8368.26,type of exercise and the hunger stimulus
8371.679,now I don't have this problem because
8373.42,basically everything makes me hungry
8376.0,um and yet I'm also okay fasting for
8378.219,part of the day yeah I'm one of those
8380.46,pseudo-intermittent fasters
8382.719,talk about what I mean by that I just
8384.399,happen to eat between 11 A.M and 8 PM
8386.859,naturally I'm not religious about it but
8391.3,um but I don't do it for any other
8392.62,reason except that that tends to be when
8394.18,I'm hungry and I exercise outside of
8396.16,that
8397.3,um in the morning typically
8399.34,in any case
8400.899,is there a way that people can determine
8404.02,what type of exercise might be better or
8405.64,worse for them based on its appetite
8407.5,stimulating or inhibiting effects
8409.479,because I also hear that you know some
8411.76,people will go for a long run and then
8413.62,they are quote unquote not hungry for
8415.359,several hours afterwards does that have
8416.979,anything to do with which fuels are
8418.72,being utilized during different forms of
8420.399,exercise that's actually a really good
8422.02,question I don't know the the mechanisms
8424.84,that can explain that answer what I can
8426.88,tell you is you hear the same comment
8428.859,for physical activity in other words
8430.359,people say
8431.56,man if I do this type of training then I
8433.78,just am exhausted and I lay around the
8435.76,rest of the day so my total caloric
8437.68,expenditure is actually compromised as
8439.42,an aggregate because I'm down um the
8441.76,data would suggest in general that
8443.5,doesn't happen
8444.7,so most of the time we don't see a
8446.439,reduction in physical activity
8449.08,um with either high intensity or steady
8450.7,state training in fact you generally see
8452.74,equal if not increased what's called
8455.439,need so it's the non-exercising part of
8457.6,your day
8458.52,in addition to the basal metabolic rate
8460.72,so physical activity wise you don't send
8462.34,to be prop now hunger is a little bit of
8463.96,a different thing
8466.0,the answer here is I don't think we have
8467.859,time to actually do justice on this so
8470.74,perhaps best to not get into this one
8473.08,yeah why don't we punt this down the
8474.76,road to our discussion about nutrition
8476.859,specifically and and weave back to it so
8479.2,we'll earmark it for that
8481.24,um meanwhile it sounds like if one is
8483.399,thinking purely in terms of uh
8486.52,burning calories yep and getting the
8488.74,health benefits of exercise to create a
8491.38,caloric deficit to create fat loss it
8494.5,doesn't matter whether or not they burn
8496.479,those calories using a form of exercise
8498.16,that relies predominantly on
8499.96,carbohydrate fat or protein correct it's
8502.96,not that it doesn't matter it's that
8504.399,either one will work
8505.78,because when we say things like that
8507.819,it's it doesn't mean they're actually
8509.08,identical
8510.22,there are some slight differences and
8512.14,maybe those differences are important
8513.22,for some people and not others
8515.02,ought to say is either one is a viable
8516.46,strategy
8517.66,great what about protein as a fuel
8520.72,as an actual feel so here let me give
8522.399,you an analogy
8524.08,imagine that you are you were with me a
8526.479,few weeks ago in southern Montana and
8528.76,we're out
8529.84,um in the wilderness for a week okay and
8531.819,it's cold out there and you needed to
8532.96,make a fire
8534.28,uh and if I said look you can pick any
8537.04,of these things there are so there's
8538.479,some wood over there we brought some
8539.74,newspaper and then we brought a match
8541.18,and we need to create a fire we're gonna
8543.04,use that fire to energy and heat up
8545.92,okay I said great the very first place
8548.2,you would probably start to make that
8549.819,fire is the match you like the match in
8552.1,any match hey it's going to light
8553.96,immediately but it's probably going to
8555.399,last 5 to 20 seconds I don't know before
8558.46,it burns out that's fossil creatine
8561.58,real fast real Burns Out
8564.16,if you were smart you would take that
8565.78,match and then light the newspaper on
8567.76,fire right now if you were to burn a
8569.859,whole newspaper it is more energy
8572.92,then you get to the match but you still
8574.6,you know I don't know what's going to
8575.859,take a few minutes some number of
8577.6,minutes before an entire 65 burns up
8579.46,five I don't know right depends on then
8581.8,yeah which type of newspaper it is I
8583.66,guess right amazing
8585.34,that's carbohydrate
8587.08,right if you were really smart you would
8589.359,use that to then light a piece of wood
8591.64,on fire and a wood if you've been in the
8593.68,wilderness it could last hours days it's
8596.02,really quite unlimited your phospho
8598.42,creatine storage is very limited small
8602.02,glycogen is a lot higher because you can
8604.3,store it in muscle you can store it in
8605.74,other places so you have more but not a
8607.78,lot fat is unlimited the average person
8610.42,if you're around say 70 kilos up 170
8613.78,pounds or so and you're moderately lean
8616.18,maybe 15 body fat nothing crazy you
8619.18,probably have enough stored fat
8621.52,to create enough energy to survive for
8624.16,more than 30 days
8626.62,right this would literally be if you
8628.24,ingested zero calories you have enough
8630.88,fuel in your stored fat to keep you
8633.16,alive for certainly 30 days
8635.8,you wouldn't feel good and all those
8637.479,things but energetically basically fat
8640.42,will never
8642.52,ever be your limiting factor to
8644.68,Performance
8645.88,so when we start talking about well what
8647.319,limits my performance in these areas you
8649.18,can just wipe fat off the list it will
8651.28,never be your limiting factor to any
8653.319,type of endurance performance you simply
8654.819,have way too much the only problem with
8657.76,fat is is just too slow I've got to
8661.24,mobilize it I've got to get in the blood
8662.8,move it that whole thing too slow so if
8665.319,I want to go faster I will never be able
8667.3,to fully utilize fat which is why we
8669.88,talked about earlier you'll never see a
8672.28,situation in which somebody is a hundred
8674.08,percent burning fat as a fuel and no
8675.88,percent carbohydrate it's always going
8678.58,to be too slow
8679.899,highest you'll get maybe 70 so percent
8682.84,protein in this equation
8684.819,is none of that now you may notice
8688.54,how do you make paper what's fibrous you
8691.24,combine with water that you it gets
8693.939,pressed it gets compressed yeah yeah
8696.16,it's made from wood
8698.62,how do you make a match
8700.12,it's made from wood
8702.16,what's carbohydrate a chain of carbon
8704.62,what's fat a chain of carbon these are
8708.46,similar molecules right they're meant to
8710.68,give you pros and cons it's very
8712.42,difficult to just light a log on fire
8714.28,without a lot of work you'd have to burn
8716.08,burn burn burn burn so these are
8717.819,complementary systems that are really
8719.62,close to the same thing protein
8722.74,is none of those things protein is more
8725.26,like a piece of metal
8726.58,so if you were out in the woods with me
8727.899,and we were trying to make a fire and
8729.22,you're like hey look I found some old
8731.08,uh
8731.979,railroad over there let's throw that on
8733.72,there I would probably look at you like
8735.16,crazy now technically can you melt metal
8737.88,sure but you're gonna burn a lot of
8740.74,energy to try to get a little bit back
8743.319,out of the metal and now you've also
8744.819,cost yourself a very very valuable
8747.34,structure
8748.54,so protein is a fuel source for exercise
8751.06,or metabolism it's just an incredibly
8752.979,poor choice your body will do it again
8755.319,maybe five to ten percent but you now
8757.72,you're burning a very valuable Supply in
8759.7,a situation in which you don't know
8761.14,where there's ever going to be anymore
8762.399,remember protein is fairly transient
8764.8,it's you're not very good at storing it
8766.479,you can store a ton of carbohydrate and
8769.18,an unlimited literally amount of fat so
8772.72,you just really need to disregard
8774.58,thinking about protein as a fuel source
8777.399,your body does not want to do it you're
8778.899,not good at it you can go through a
8781.0,process of gluconeogenesis from protein
8783.819,make glucose from it is just very poor
8787.18,you're not going to get much out of the
8789.28,exchange and you've burned your supply
8791.92,of metal which is going to be very
8793.78,difficult it's a very high commodity in
8796.42,the woods or the Wilderness to have
8798.1,something like metal for people that
8800.38,consume very low carbohydrate or zero
8802.54,carbohydrate diets are they pulling more
8806.2,energy from muscle so which I imagine is
8809.439,a conversion of amino acids into ready
8811.6,carbon chains yeah I mean in this
8813.52,particular case once you've reached um
8816.1,a certain level of adaptation you've
8818.02,just gotten extremely good at generating
8819.7,glucose from other Fashions right so you
8823.0,can bias heavily towards fat adaptation
8825.52,the downside is and we've seen this born
8827.38,in literature you're going to perform
8829.3,slower
8830.8,so if you don't care about maximizing
8833.2,performance especially over something
8834.819,where it is a maximal effort for a few
8836.74,minutes or something then maybe you're
8838.42,not concerned and that's absolutely
8839.859,great especially for people just don't
8841.24,exercise
8842.62,then hey geez very little concern here
8844.479,but if you're interested in your
8845.859,performance and you're wondering why
8847.12,you're just like slugging it down well
8849.16,what you've done is you've down
8850.24,regulated the ability literally the
8852.22,enzymes responsible for that entire
8854.14,anaerobic glycolysis portion they get
8857.02,down regulated which means there's not
8858.28,as much around anymore and so you get
8859.84,really bad and slow at using
8861.88,carbohydrates as a fuel source so it's a
8863.439,very poor strategy for people on an
8865.359,anaerobic based sport or who like that
8867.76,type of activity again if you don't care
8869.02,no problem if you don't exercise at all
8872.02,then you really have no problem there
8873.399,which is actually why
8875.14,a high fat low carbohydrate nutrition
8877.899,strategy for people who don't do much
8880.0,physical activity is probably like very
8882.46,well it's very effective it is a really
8885.819,good strategy for weight management for
8887.979,energy stabilization throughout the day
8889.479,and the research would very much support
8891.34,that in my observation I would agree
8893.38,I've tried low carbohydrate diets of
8895.54,severely limiting or completely
8898.06,eliminating carbohydrate and
8900.399,after about two or three days I feel
8903.22,pretty lousy but mostly because I want
8905.08,to train very intensely in the gym in
8908.26,addition to doing longer runs I tend to
8910.18,do all of those things across the week
8911.74,yeah but I've also observed and in fact
8914.979,know several people that love the very
8918.939,low carbohydrate AKA ketogenic type diet
8921.58,they're not doing ketogenic diets for
8923.14,mental health reasons per se but indeed
8926.5,those people tend to do very limited
8928.6,exercise or they tend to do a lot of
8930.52,long endurance but low intensity long
8933.58,endurance these are the I walk to get my
8936.58,exercise types and they do indeed walk a
8938.62,lot and some of them manage to control
8940.899,their weight very readily and like that
8943.12,diet for that reason
8944.439,um when we had Lane Norton on the
8945.76,podcast he pointed out quite aptly that
8948.34,in order to lose weight you have to
8949.899,restrict something either of course time
8951.64,or macronutrients Etc to arrive at that
8954.76,sub caloric threshold get below the the
8958.18,sub maintenance threshold I guess one of
8960.819,the things I want to point out is
8963.1,this should be received as again not a
8965.979,this is better or worse this is just you
8968.26,now have a ton of options
8969.939,so whatever personal preference other
8971.859,factors you get to craft this strategy
8974.439,of performance Aesthetics and health
8977.8,based on your personal preferences
8980.38,at this point I'd like to go back to our
8982.479,classic list of nine adaptations that
8986.02,exercise can induce
8988.0,the first four of course being largely
8990.96,largely unrelated to today's
8992.92,conversation but that we're covered in
8995.02,the episode
8996.1,that we did on strength speed and
8999.819,hypertrophy so just to remind people the
9002.399,nine adaptations are number one skill
9004.68,and technique two speed three power
9007.02,which is speed times Force four strength
9010.26,and five hypertrophy today we're talking
9012.66,about the remaining adaptations on that
9014.28,list starting with muscular endurance
9016.819,followed by anaerobic capacity
9020.28,followed by maximal aerobic output and
9023.7,finishing at number nine with long
9025.74,duration exercise so
9028.979,if we could start with muscular
9030.66,endurance this would be number six on
9034.319,the list of nine adaptations
9037.02,muscular endurance
9039.54,how do I build muscular endurance why
9042.3,should I build muscular endurance and
9045.359,just to remind me what fuel sources
9049.02,are predominating when I'm training for
9052.38,muscular endurance great so remember
9054.0,muscular endurance is something that's
9055.859,going to be generally in a local muscle
9058.5,it is not a cardiovascular or systemic
9060.84,issue and it tends to be something in
9063.12,the neighborhood of say five to maybe
9066.06,even up to 50 repetitions so this is the
9069.42,classic example we'll give here is how
9070.859,many push-ups can you do in a row most
9072.96,people are going to land somewhere in
9074.1,that range I just said how many sit-ups
9075.96,can you do in a minute how many pull-ups
9077.399,how long can you hang on a bar
9080.1,um as a dead hang things like that
9081.479,that's muscular endurance muscular
9082.74,endurance is not a mild run or a
9085.74,marathon or anything like that so uh how
9088.5,long can I stand without breaking
9090.06,posture
9091.26,this is muscular endurance a plank a
9093.479,wall sit great yes love all these things
9096.479,okay now the reason I took you on that
9099.84,big long metabolism Journey is so I
9102.96,could help you understand exactly how to
9105.06,train
9105.96,this Factor any of these factors
9108.42,with a more comprehensive understanding
9110.399,of what's Happening meaning thinking
9112.26,back to metabolism
9113.7,if I'm going to ask my triceps to do 50
9116.46,push-ups in a row
9118.14,what's going to be my limiting factor am
9120.24,I going to run out of fat
9121.92,no chance am I going to run out of
9125.28,glycogen no chance that's way too few of
9130.02,repetitions you have a lot left there so
9132.0,what's going to be the thing that stops
9133.2,me from getting 51 repetitions either
9136.02,you're going to have too high
9138.06,of a pH rise so too much acid build up
9143.46,or you're going to have a problem
9145.14,clearing the waste
9147.06,so really this is two factors dealing
9149.88,with acid buildup and getting acid out
9153.6,of the muscle tissue and end of
9155.22,circulation because you have plenty of
9156.72,ability to handle that small amount of
9158.76,acid buildup in your entire body it's
9161.58,just you can't handle it in that tiny
9163.14,spot now I picked the tricep for a very
9165.24,specific reason
9166.5,you're gonna deal with more pain when
9169.439,you use a large muscle group like your
9171.479,quads or your glutes than you are with a
9173.04,small muscle group for example nobody
9175.319,ever threw up after arm day
9178.08,but a lot of people throw up after leg
9179.939,day why is that look at the total amount
9183.3,of waste that you're dumping into your
9184.68,system when you have quadrupled or 10x
9186.96,the muscle size small muscle groups are
9190.319,only really going to be challenged in
9191.88,that local area large ones will dump so
9194.1,much waste into the system that you'll
9195.96,want to avoid that as quickly as
9197.46,possible and that's one of the reasons
9199.08,why you throw up
9200.46,after Hard Exercise great so
9204.359,the reason I'm laughing because I don't
9206.939,think I've ever thrown up uh from a
9209.28,weight training session and so it's
9211.02,making me wonder if I've ever trained
9212.64,that hard I've received uh or obtained
9216.479,the progress that I've wanted to do
9217.92,generally over time not every week every
9219.72,workout every month but certainly over
9222.78,the 30 plus years that I've been weight
9224.64,training I've achieved the results I've
9226.38,wanted I have however
9228.2,vomited after a long run
9231.06,when I didn't hydrate well oh or if I
9233.819,drink too much water sure oh sure too
9235.859,much water yeah you'll you'll get that
9237.3,out quick right I just uh want to be
9238.859,clear because I think some people are
9239.819,getting the picture that if they're not
9241.14,vomiting then after their leg workout
9243.3,that they're not training according to
9244.92,uh your standards Again by the way um Dr
9247.68,Andy Galvin runs experiments in his lab
9249.359,he's recruiting subjects
9250.58,[Laughter]
9252.899,also known as my graduate students
9254.819,that's right in any event sorry to
9256.979,interrupt uh but I felt it was the
9258.72,necessary Interruption so muscular
9260.76,endurance
9262.26,there's plenty of fuel plenty of fuel
9264.84,you manage acid buildup and you also
9267.899,need to get that fuel out of you that's
9269.34,going to be a capitalization issue so
9271.68,the way that we can think about this is
9273.319,capillaries surround your muscle and the
9277.02,whole point of them is so that blood can
9278.7,come into them they hit this
9280.08,capitalization that actually slows the
9282.24,diffusion rate of blood down and so you
9285.06,can exchange nutrients in and get waste
9287.46,products out and then we get things back
9289.62,into circulation so the more of those
9291.479,you have the better you are at
9293.1,dispersing any of these waste products
9295.5,build up whether it's CO2 or the acid so
9298.08,the adaptation you're looking for here
9299.52,is an increase in capitalization
9300.66,potentially a slight increase in
9302.88,mitochondria but the time is too fast
9305.939,right so we're going to be able to need
9307.74,to do these 50 repetitions and say under
9309.72,a minute or something like that so
9311.28,getting the mobilization into the
9312.96,mitochondria getting fuel that way too
9315.24,slow it's not really going to get our
9317.34,performance here so what are strategies
9319.439,to increase
9320.819,acid buffering ability and then
9323.28,capitalization
9324.78,so on the capitalization side you simply
9327.06,need to train
9328.56,at that ability so you go close to
9330.78,failure and practice that often that
9332.52,alone will increase increase blood flow
9334.26,to that local area which will take you
9336.96,through your process of increasing
9338.58,capitalization easy peasy specificity
9341.84,just to briefly interrupt
9345.18,I find it remarkable although not
9348.18,surprising giving how amazing the human
9350.819,body is that simply by doing some
9354.18,movement repeat like a wall set or a uh
9357.0,or push-ups or dips for that matter
9359.479,repeatedly over and over and over until
9361.439,you reach that failure Point yep or that
9364.68,quaking point in the case of a wall set
9367.58,that provides a stimulus for more
9370.26,capillaries to be built into the system
9372.54,literally the the production or the
9375.899,um the trafficking of endothelial cells
9378.24,which make up the capillaries and allow
9380.64,basically more little pipes to feed the
9382.8,system with oxygen and remove waste
9384.78,products it's like irrigation right
9386.22,imagine you had a giant field and you
9387.66,had two big pipes running down the
9389.28,outside well in fact if you want to make
9391.08,sure water gets evenly dispersed across
9392.939,the entire field you'll have a bunch of
9394.62,offshooting little pipes and the more
9396.479,those you have the more coverage you get
9399.78,do we know what the specific signal is
9402.84,that says hey
9405.42,I failed at this we need more
9407.399,capillaries I actually don't know what
9408.84,that is I could I would speculate It's a
9410.58,combination of
9412.62,um acidity as well as carbon dioxide and
9415.8,probably some nitric oxide stuff
9417.06,happening there but I actually don't
9418.14,know I'm guessing nobody knows for sure
9420.54,because we still don't know for instance
9421.859,what the exact signal is for hypertrophy
9424.08,it's kind of an amazing situation we
9425.7,know the requirements for getting the
9427.319,results that we want yeah but we still
9429.359,don't know what the specific signal is
9431.52,um in any event what I'm hearing is
9433.8,building more capillaries is great for
9436.38,enhancing muscular endurance and the way
9439.02,to get more capillaries into those
9440.939,muscles is to train for muscular
9443.1,endurance
9444.3,by getting
9445.74,close to failure or to some point where
9447.84,you simply can't continue for whatever
9449.28,reason could you give us an example of
9452.22,what a reasonable training protocol
9453.6,might be in terms of
9455.479,the classic Galpin lists now exercise
9459.0,Choice maybe a few options order
9463.74,volume and frequency great what should
9466.08,we be doing how often should we be doing
9467.64,it and you know for instance should I do
9469.979,wall sets to failures and push-ups to
9471.78,failure given that this is a local
9473.7,process I'm guessing that if I do
9476.399,push-ups to failure I'm not going to
9477.72,increase the number of capillaries in my
9479.04,legs very much correct
9480.96,so you nailed it exercise choice is high
9483.72,Precision here so pick the muscle group
9486.6,and the exact sequencing and movement
9490.92,pattern you want High Precision this is
9493.319,the thing if you want to get better at
9494.58,applying hold the plank you're going to
9495.66,do more push-ups two more push-ups you
9497.58,can do some other stuff that's
9499.08,complementary but really this is a high
9501.359,Precision game do the exact same thing
9503.04,for exercise Choice very simple there
9505.26,okay in terms of exercise order I
9508.02,suppose this dovetails with volume yeah
9509.76,can I combine
9511.8,um training let's say wall sets for my
9514.26,quads and real you know nearby muscle
9516.24,groups and then do push-ups to failure
9519.18,uh and then also do some sort of um
9522.18,pulling exercise to failure yep
9524.34,absolutely again pick the exercises you
9526.02,want the movement patterns you want to
9527.28,do and do them the order almost doesn't
9529.26,matter with the one caveat with larger
9532.2,muscle groups particularly again
9533.64,multiple leg activities that will induce
9536.76,a small amount of systemic fatigue and
9540.0,so if you I guess theoretically wanted
9541.5,to maximize your push-up number
9543.72,and you did a whole bunch of say split
9546.24,squats
9547.26,and you just did those and and you you
9550.439,know did lunges for a mile or something
9552.479,like that you might actually slightly
9554.399,compromise you might not but you might
9556.319,slightly compromise your ability to do
9557.939,as many pull-ups in a row or hold a bend
9560.16,over row or something like that so if
9561.42,you really cared about that level then
9563.58,you maybe want to do the one thing
9564.66,that's most important first in general
9566.04,my recommendation though is to do the
9567.479,bigger muscle group first how many sets
9570.359,and how often should one perform
9574.14,training for muscular endurance
9576.479,and when now the lovely part here is
9579.42,we've moved down the Spectrum past
9581.28,hypertrophy
9582.66,you don't need a lot of load here in
9584.76,fact the load only needs to be at or
9587.34,slightly above what you want to move
9590.22,so if you want to get better at
9592.62,moving 50 of your one rep max you don't
9595.08,really need to train much more than 50
9596.819,maybe 55 or 60 percent of your one or
9599.28,Max because if you go higher than that
9601.74,the repetition count is going to fall
9603.899,and you're no longer going to be
9605.22,training muscular endurance so you just
9607.2,need to stay right around that number
9609.18,that you want to work on so again if the
9610.8,target is doing more pull-ups and
9613.02,assuming that you have the strength to
9615.54,do it you check that box you simply need
9617.76,to practice the repetition range that
9620.1,you want to be in that's all it takes
9622.319,you can repeat that a number of times
9624.42,but because remember the volume is
9628.2,fairly low the load is very very low you
9632.04,can actually repeat these quite
9633.06,frequently so you won't get extremely
9635.46,sore from muscular endurance relative to
9637.62,traditional hypertrophy straining
9639.0,because the load is very very light so
9640.92,you can do these more frequently if you
9642.96,would like
9643.859,more frequently such as you could do it
9646.68,three or four times a week easy if you
9648.72,would like you don't necessarily need to
9649.92,three days a week per muscle group is
9652.14,probably fine here
9653.88,um if you wanted to do more sets on a
9656.52,given day and do less days that would be
9659.76,fine so if you want to do two days a
9661.2,week and you say wanted to do let's say
9663.96,you could do 25 push-ups and the goal is
9666.54,to get to 30 push-ups just as an example
9669.359,you might say okay I'm gonna do sets of
9672.42,17.
9673.74,and I'm going to do three sets of that
9675.24,I'm gonna do that three days a week
9676.92,that's going to build up quite a bit or
9679.14,you could say look I'm gonna do a set
9681.3,basically to failure I'm going to
9683.52,recover and do one or two sets that say
9685.92,80 percent
9687.12,and I'll do that twice a week
9689.28,that's going to push the pace pretty
9690.66,well you're going to have a lot of gains
9692.46,from that and again this is not about
9694.62,hypertrophy this is about muscular
9696.42,endurance so I do want to emphasize and
9699.66,again please correct me if I'm um
9701.52,talking out of line here I do want to
9703.5,emphasize that
9704.76,because we mentioned pull-ups if you
9708.12,can't get 25 pull-ups then and you're
9711.66,doing 10 you're training for hypertrophy
9713.939,you're not training for muscular
9714.78,endurance personally remember there's a
9716.22,big cross over here
9717.54,so anytime we're talking past like 15
9721.2,reps we're technically in hypertrophy
9723.42,and muscular endurance got it so here's
9725.46,the common mistake
9726.78,I don't want to get bulky
9728.88,so I'm I'm gonna go lighter and do more
9730.8,reps
9731.88,and then people grow and then you landed
9733.979,still right in the middle of hypertri
9735.479,rank right so like for people who are
9737.16,like oh my gosh like every time I lift
9738.78,weights I blow up I go lighter I do more
9740.52,reps and I you're still writing the
9742.26,hypertrophy song they'd actually be much
9744.12,better off training very very heavy in
9746.16,the one to three rep range they'd get
9747.84,really strong and they wouldn't grow
9749.22,much exactly
9751.14,so tell me if this is a reasonable
9753.06,protocol for what I'm going to call the
9755.58,typical person in my mind the typical
9757.439,person is somebody who hopefully is
9759.42,doing resistance training hitting that
9762.54,10 sets per muscle group per week
9765.18,minimum yep
9766.8,to maintain or build strength and
9769.56,hypertrophy
9771.54,but is also doing some long duration
9773.88,training that we'll talk about in a
9775.38,little bit maybe throwing in uh high
9778.02,intensity workout here there some
9779.939,Sprints maybe some plyometrics
9782.64,some skill based training they're doing
9784.56,a bunch of different things to be all
9786.899,what I would call All Around fit yeah
9788.64,they're not training for any specific
9790.02,event or trying to maximize any one of
9792.18,the nine adaptations to the exclusion of
9794.399,the others
9795.96,that person decide okay after
9798.72,um they do their longer run they're
9801.24,gonna do uh Max time a plank to Max
9805.14,duration
9806.34,they're going to do a wall set to Max
9807.78,duration and they're going to do
9808.74,push-ups to Max duration and then also
9811.14,do that same workout before they do
9814.8,their high intensity interval training
9817.02,some other point during the week and
9819.18,then maybe even do it uh again
9822.3,um on their so-called rest day just a
9825.12,real quick five minutes of sure and in
9827.22,doing so build more capillaries into the
9829.319,relevant muscle groups and build their
9831.12,muscular endurance yep without eating
9833.64,into their overall recovery too much too
9835.62,much yeah so again the nice part about
9837.18,this is they don't Hammer you too much
9839.1,you're not going to get tremendously
9840.66,sore if you keep the load light the only
9842.76,switch I'd make there is I would
9844.02,probably do them after your interval
9846.3,rather than before so you can make sure
9847.8,you keep quality there and you're not
9849.84,compromised by a local muscular
9851.34,endurance when you're actually trying to
9852.6,get a more systemic fatigue with
9854.76,something like a higher intensity
9855.92,interval training so that would work
9857.88,fantastic the only other variable we
9860.52,have in it on here is progression and
9862.8,this is very simple try to add a rep or
9865.08,two per week
9866.939,that's really all you have to go after
9868.26,so if you're up to 22 this week try to
9870.54,hit 23 next week or for wall sits and
9872.939,planks that would be added add time time
9874.68,yep and if and if you run into a wall
9877.08,there
9878.34,just like the same Concepts we talked
9880.62,about with strength or hypertrophy back
9882.479,it down to more like in the 80 or 85
9884.7,range and accumulate a lot more practice
9888.42,that's going to help a lot with
9889.62,capitalization as well as asset
9891.84,buffering so you're going to continue to
9893.1,give yourself signals for up regulation
9895.22,of the processes needed for that and
9898.62,it's not always pushing you to the end
9900.06,failure just like we don't want to
9901.38,always go to failure with strength we
9902.64,don't want to always go to failure with
9903.899,high intensity intervals either same
9905.76,thing would be happening here
9907.26,what about anaerobic capacity how should
9910.08,people train for anaerobic capacity
9912.359,what exactly are they training for
9914.58,meaning what is the structural or seller
9917.28,adaptation or adaptations that are
9918.899,occurring that allow for increases in
9920.399,anaerobic capacity and why are increases
9923.34,in anaerobic capacity good for us
9926.939,even if we're a quote unquote endurance
9929.399,athlete or we are a recreational
9931.7,exerciser who is not interested in
9933.96,building more muscle speed or things
9936.18,that I typically associate with
9937.68,anaerobic capacity yeah so this is
9940.02,really really fun
9942.6,remember anaerobic capacity is the total
9945.6,amount of work you can do for something
9947.04,like seconds to a few minutes and this
9949.92,is extremely high levels of fatigue the
9951.96,highest you're really going to see and
9953.64,by fatigue here I mean acid buildup
9956.64,byproducts not fatigue is in like
9958.8,mentally I don't want to do this anymore
9960.359,so if we just think about the energetic
9963.06,for a second
9965.04,I'm gonna do say let's take a really
9967.439,easy example of people have done that
9969.24,thing where you uh you'll go to the
9971.22,track and you sprint the straightaways
9973.56,and you walk the corners remember that
9975.66,sort of thing yeah uh tabatas
9978.84,30 on 30 off things like this like this
9981.84,is what we're talking about in this kind
9984.0,of anaerobic capacity area now
9987.24,here's what's going to happen is fat
9989.52,going to be your limiting no we've
9991.979,already made that clear right what about
9993.96,carbohydrates well if it's a single bout
9997.26,or a two or three bouts probably not but
9999.6,if you're doing this for a long time say
10001.34,you're going to go 30 on 30 off for 20
10003.68,rounds you may actually start reaching a
10006.5,point of running out of my muscle
10008.24,glycogen
10009.74,in any of those cases though you're
10011.6,going to be running into an acid problem
10015.2,if you were to continue to do this
10016.64,multiple repetitions in addition to
10018.92,running low and muscle glycogen you're
10020.66,also going to start running into oxygen
10022.939,transportation problems
10024.92,because you're building up a lot of
10026.479,byproducts you've got to continue you
10028.34,will actually cruise into aerobic
10030.5,glycolysis this is exactly why the
10033.56,community that I have worked a lot with
10034.88,professional fighters
10036.74,very high level boxers world champions
10038.96,UFC fighters it is a five minute round
10043.04,that you're going to do five times this
10044.84,is for world championship fights you get
10046.22,one minute break in between so imagine
10047.6,going like 30 on 30 off for five minutes
10049.88,getting a one minute break and doing
10051.5,that five times
10052.88,even though the individual ballots are
10054.92,30 seconds long the entire thing lasts
10057.8,so long it is primarily aerobic
10060.68,you have to have both capacities you got
10062.72,to get really high anaerobic you also
10064.399,have to have a lot of aerobic going on
10066.319,you have you're going to start running
10067.819,into limitations because of heart rate
10071.18,stroke volume and then even potentially
10073.7,ventilation
10075.02,the need for oxygen to be able to come
10077.06,in and clear the carbon dioxide totally
10079.76,out of the system becomes a problem
10081.68,because not only are you having so much
10083.78,build up for such a long time you're
10085.52,also using multiple muscle groups so now
10088.04,this is a very important distinction
10089.24,muscular endurance tends to be localized
10091.399,now this is not
10093.68,right if you're doing these intervals
10095.359,you're on an assault bike you're
10096.439,sprinting up a hill you're grappling
10097.76,with somebody you have a lot of muscles
10099.92,being involved which means all of that
10101.24,waste is being dumped into the central
10102.8,part you have to clear it and I'm by
10104.72,clearance I now mean not out of the
10106.1,muscle I mean out of the body
10108.319,so your ability to bring in and utilize
10110.18,oxygen is going to be a major limitation
10112.64,to your ability to handle this stuff so
10115.28,what do you do
10116.899,well specificity wins practice the exact
10120.74,thing you're talking about so if you
10122.06,want to get better at sprinting the
10124.1,straightaways and walking the corners do
10126.439,that
10127.64,you can't always do it though you're
10129.74,going to run into limitations so this is
10131.3,when backing off to a lower intensity
10133.88,is going to give you a lot of benefits
10135.56,we know very clearly if you want to
10137.84,improve cardiovascular fitness high
10140.96,intensity moderate intensity and low
10142.939,intensity are effective and you actually
10144.38,probably want to do a little bit of all
10146.06,of them
10146.96,this is why none of our Fighters would
10149.54,ever just do high intensity training
10151.28,there's going to be some moderate we
10154.1,tend to call this like cardiac output
10155.66,training you can think of this as like
10158.24,anywhere between Zone 2 to zone four if
10161.0,you like zones I don't use them
10162.68,personally so I'm just going to
10164.899,intentionally interrupt you because this
10167.54,issue of zones has come up a few times I
10170.06,want to make sure everybody's on the
10171.38,same page you also mentioned that you
10173.359,don't necessarily favor the Zone
10175.18,nomenclature but for those not familiar
10178.96,Zone one two three four all the way up
10182.0,to five
10183.02,is a kind of uh back of the envelope uh
10187.34,type verbiage for some people and is
10189.62,more precisely followed by for other
10192.08,people meaning
10193.76,for me uh Zone one is simply walking uh
10198.26,easy walking zone two would be for
10201.08,anybody the
10203.24,Pace or intensity of exercise that one
10205.399,could perform while still maintaining a
10207.5,conversation but just barely
10210.02,meaning if you were to push any harder
10212.72,then it would be difficult to hold that
10215.359,conversation then you'd be in zone three
10217.7,and then zone three four five as I
10220.46,understand them are a little bit vague
10222.52,but maybe you could give us a sense of
10225.38,the breathing patterns associated with
10227.24,each of the zones so that people could
10230.3,map to those uh when we discuss Zone one
10233.96,through five uh and as I say all this I
10237.68,certainly
10238.939,um tip my hat to all of those people out
10241.76,there who like to measure percent of
10243.5,maximum heart rate they like to use
10245.54,heart rate monitors
10247.1,um they're using any number of different
10248.24,devices I sometimes use those devices
10250.7,but in general I tend not to and I use
10252.5,my breathing as a Rough Guide of which
10254.54,zone I'm in so before we go back to
10257.359,specific protocols for anaerobic
10259.28,capacity
10260.6,tell me how you think about Zone one
10263.479,through five and how people might be
10265.34,able to assess whether or not they are
10266.84,in zone one two three or four or five
10269.6,great so zone five is that absolute top
10272.6,thing and we can flag ourselves there I
10274.819,liked how you flagged one and two the
10276.439,distinction between three four and five
10277.819,I'm less concerned with either uh we
10280.28,will do some heart rate stuff but not to
10283.22,identify what zone we're in
10285.08,um the fact is the distinction between
10286.22,those zones is basically just made up
10288.92,right that not that it's fake but
10290.54,there's no like
10291.979,rationale there it's a little bit like
10293.84,perceived effort and weightlifting you
10296.0,know how are you at 100 output or 70 you
10299.42,know when you're at zero and you know
10301.16,when you're at 100 in that moment but
10303.979,the difference between 60 and 70 is
10306.22,anybody's guess totally so we use or the
10309.08,relevance right so why does it matter if
10310.58,I'm at 60 or 70. is there actual
10312.5,difference there's not right so it
10314.54,doesn't really matter in that regard
10316.399,um if you're a very highly trained
10317.96,particularly cyclist things like that
10320.0,then and you can control a lot of
10321.5,circumstances those things start to make
10323.6,a lot more sense um but when you're in
10325.279,an open environment like the athletes I
10326.84,deal with
10328.1,just not gonna it's not gonna matter
10329.66,that much so the way that I approach
10332.12,this is
10333.56,and I will use this word intentionally
10335.3,stolen directly from Brian McKenzie and
10339.08,his company shift adapt they use what's
10342.08,called a gear system and I absolutely
10343.88,love it it's what we've been using for a
10345.2,long time
10346.22,so with Brian with your permission I'm
10347.779,going to take it right now thank you
10348.859,Brian he gave me the permission to thank
10350.0,you Brian Brian's a good friend of of
10351.68,ours and I do think the breathing gear
10354.859,system is a terrific way to think about
10357.439,the zones and to get a good sense of
10360.62,what zone one happens to be yeah great
10362.42,so um the first gear is your ability to
10365.3,Simply breathe in and out through your
10367.279,nose at a set Cadence so basically
10370.16,regardless of how hard you're working
10372.14,can you restrict your breathing to like
10373.939,a two to three second inhale
10376.22,and then a two to three second exhale
10378.68,and this is really clever actually
10380.66,because
10382.279,a lot of folks will jump immediately
10384.439,into an over breathing strategy which
10386.18,means you'll be ventilating more than
10387.56,you need which actually sends that rer
10389.6,up higher than it needs to be which
10392.3,kicks you higher into carbohydrate
10394.399,utilization if you're supposed to be in
10396.74,quote unquote Zone one you're trying to
10399.14,be efficient not fast so using more
10402.68,carbohydrates than you need is not
10404.54,beneficial here
10405.859,you're walking for the day you're out on
10408.319,a longer hike you're enjoying the day
10409.939,you shouldn't be trying to ramp up
10411.439,carbohydrate metabolism it should be
10414.56,all right and so this would be getting
10416.72,into an argument with somebody while on
10419.0,a long walk you feel exhausted
10420.5,afterwards and over breathing yeah
10422.42,totally right okay yeah so you should be
10424.279,able to breathe at a specific Cadence
10425.96,and generally people are um doing that
10428.66,more frequently than they need right
10430.279,zone two uh rather gear two
10434.3,is
10435.68,inhaling and exhaling at whatever rate
10437.72,you needed to be but still nasal only so
10440.06,it is a force
10442.7,right whatever you need to do but your
10445.76,mouth is closed the entire time
10447.74,you've shifted higher up you're burning
10449.84,more and more carbohydrate as the fuel
10451.64,source but you're still able to control
10453.56,that and restrict the nasal breathing
10455.84,now gear three and four which is our
10458.779,final ones there's no gear five gear uh
10461.3,three and four is like a subtle strength
10462.979,and I actually don't even care about the
10464.479,difference there I basically use gear
10465.8,one two and then S4 but you're basically
10468.2,talking about either a nose to mouth
10470.24,strategy
10471.38,or a straight up mouth mouth right so
10473.42,breathing in through the nose out
10474.74,through the mouth if you can control it
10476.24,that way you can do the opposite
10477.319,actually right can you breathe in
10479.54,and out through your nose but the
10481.1,classic one people do is enter the nose
10482.54,out the mouth
10483.74,um again I really don't even care about
10484.88,distinction I basically jump from two to
10487.399,four Brian May do it differently I don't
10489.38,actually know
10490.52,um four is just mouth mouth right and
10492.2,this is the case in most sporting
10493.76,applications you're going to be
10495.08,breathing
10496.279,because the nose is restricted right
10498.62,there's only so much space and as we
10500.24,talked about earlier the consequences of
10502.279,not having enough oxygen in or CO2
10505.58,exhalation if you're restricting that
10507.26,this is going to be problematic so in
10509.359,your actual competition please go to the
10512.3,mouth if you need to right we practice a
10514.58,lot trying to stay nasal only for as
10516.56,long as possible but that's going to
10519.26,eventually happen when you're doing your
10520.819,high intensity intervals and you're
10522.02,really going as hard as you can you're
10523.939,going to have to go to your mouth unless
10525.14,you're an absolute Freakazoid and you
10527.359,can say in your nose but that's not
10529.1,going to happen right most people can't
10530.72,get past say 70 or 80 percent
10533.479,while breathing through your nose um I
10535.64,know some people can get higher but
10536.66,that's the general distinction so we pay
10538.64,much more attention to those particular
10540.68,gears than we do heart rate zones and
10543.62,zone five would be just pure mouth
10545.42,breathing all out and then running into
10547.46,your life the gear system is just one to
10549.2,four there's no fifth gear got it so the
10551.66,gear four would again be mouth mouth
10553.1,breathing as much in as you can
10554.54,breathing as much as you can out got it
10556.279,and I I appreciate your description of
10558.26,of the gear system and how it um roughly
10560.96,relates to the zones we've been talking
10562.58,about also
10564.38,um I'm reminded if anyone wants to
10567.04,experience the relationship between
10569.18,breathing in the offloading of carbon
10570.859,dioxide and your ability to exert effort
10572.84,in anything a game that a friend of mine
10575.0,sometimes likes to play when we walk or
10577.46,Jog and talk is he'll say let's just
10579.859,hold our breath now until we hit that
10582.439,piling or that
10584.359,um uh lifeguard stand on the beach and
10586.96,within seconds you actually can start to
10590.0,panic absolutely also becomes very hard
10592.399,to coordinate your action after a little
10594.5,while again be really careful with this
10596.06,but but it will teach you in a moment in
10599.06,a very real world way how important it
10600.979,is to be able to offload carbon dioxide
10602.66,because you're probably not running out
10604.46,of oxygen at those lower intensities no
10606.26,questions You're simply building up
10607.399,carbon dioxide and that gas reflex is
10609.74,screaming to go off and you're actively
10611.6,suppressing it yeah so the interesting
10613.22,test here is your CO2 Tolerance on
10616.16,Ryan's website you can go directly there
10617.899,you can there's a video to how to run
10619.52,this test and then you can put in your
10621.56,numbers and it'll tell you sort of
10623.24,exactly what to do as a result of it but
10625.819,the CO2 tolerance test is a test of
10627.68,exactly what you just mentioned so you
10630.14,should be fairly tolerant in other words
10632.18,non-reactive
10633.74,can be responsive but non-reactive
10636.8,two elevations in CO2 so you should see
10639.14,them and feel them but you should be
10640.64,choosing how you respond rather than
10642.439,adding a reaction
10644.42,um there are interesting data looking at
10646.279,things like out of the blue panic
10647.66,attacks
10648.62,you can actually notice those in blood
10651.319,via rises in CO2 up to 45 minutes prior
10654.38,to the event happening so there are
10656.479,signals happening in your body that you
10659.42,may be sensitive or not sensitive to the
10662.12,more in tune you can get with that the
10664.46,better your life is going to be and even
10666.439,if we're specifically just talking about
10668.18,exercise performance so it's okay for
10671.06,CO2 to rise it's going to rise it's a
10673.34,byproduct of anaerobic anaerobic
10675.5,metabolism it's a byproduct of
10677.06,carbohydrate and fat metabolism as we've
10679.88,established it's going to get there
10681.26,you're going to feel that however if you
10684.439,immediately go into a panic because of a
10686.96,small increase in CO2
10688.88,this is a problem so returning to
10691.46,anaerobic capacity this morning we were
10694.16,training not together I couldn't keep up
10696.26,with your workout but I uh but in the
10698.479,same uh General space and I did my once
10701.84,a week maximum heart rate uh one minute
10704.3,Sprint on the assault bike sometimes
10706.1,I'll do more minutes uh meaning I will
10708.62,do a one minute then take some rest and
10710.779,do another minute after some rest but I
10713.0,decided to do that one minute with you
10714.5,there so I could learn from you and
10716.3,indeed
10717.5,um
10718.279,I have to assume that that was largely
10720.439,within the anaerobic capacity Realm
10724.58,the first 30 seconds or so were
10726.74,manageable we're getting more and more
10728.06,painful there was a quit signal going
10730.279,off in my head you said there's real
10732.56,magic that occurs around second 40 and
10734.42,indeed somewhere around second 40 for
10736.1,whatever reason it seemed easier but at
10737.779,the one minute Mark I was happy to stop
10739.1,because I was really at at least what
10741.2,fell to me uh 100 output yeah is that a
10744.979,good protocol for building up anaerobic
10747.08,capacity keeping in mind what you said
10749.12,before which is that specificity or
10751.399,precision as you've raised it
10753.5,um is important that is if I want to
10756.14,train uh anaerobic capacity for
10757.939,sprinting I probably should have been
10759.08,sprinting cycling I was I was on the
10761.3,assault bike
10762.56,um and so on
10764.54,how many of those one minute all out
10767.3,Sprints or 30 second all-out sprints on
10770.42,the on the bike
10771.68,could and should one perform per workout
10774.74,and per week so marching through
10776.66,exercise Choice yep let's do it um order
10779.359,volume frequency and progression yep
10782.359,choice of exercises
10784.52,train for what you want to improve is
10786.68,that right
10787.58,not necessarily so in this particular
10790.46,case if you have a specific goal yes of
10792.859,course Do It
10794.06,um exercise Choice a couple of things
10795.5,you want to look for you want to pick
10797.66,something that you feel extremely
10800.06,confident in the movement with
10802.04,because you're going to forget your
10803.899,brain very quickly here because you're
10805.34,going to go into our pain cave okay so
10807.38,if you're not comfortable running
10810.14,don't go run here you're never going to
10812.66,get to the spot we need to get to it if
10814.399,you're not comfortable or if every time
10815.66,you you go on a rower your low back
10817.88,hurts the next day
10819.439,don't do it if you're not comfortable
10821.66,using kettlebell swings you get the
10823.52,point don't do an exercise you're not
10824.779,comfortable with you also secondarily
10826.279,want to be carefully cautious of heavy
10829.16,eccentric loads
10830.779,because you're going to be doing a lot
10832.1,of repetitions at a high intensity so
10833.66,this is where I love an assault bike
10835.34,this is why a rower is great swimming is
10837.319,amazing running uphill
10839.24,generally more favorable than running on
10841.779,normal ground especially if you're not
10844.46,Runner don't run downhill that's a lot
10846.859,of eccentric load I don't love things
10848.84,like box jumps here
10850.58,right because again a lot of eccentric
10852.5,loading if suppose you can jump up land
10854.42,on the box step down but now you're
10855.92,you're again you're too many things are
10857.24,going in your mind I don't want to slip
10858.56,and fall I don't want to smash my
10859.88,on the box what happens if I'm too many
10862.04,variables
10863.42,pick something that is safer where you
10865.399,can really focus on your breathing and
10866.84,your posture
10868.1,and the performance
10869.96,all right so that's exercise Choice and
10871.58,then within that if there's some
10872.66,specific thing you want to get better at
10873.92,go ahead do it okay
10876.68,how many different movements meaning
10879.859,should I do the assault bike and then uh
10882.92,some form of safe executable uh overhead
10886.76,pressing
10888.26,um it's a little hard it's a little
10889.64,harder to imagine
10890.96,um anaerobic capacity for the upper body
10892.58,unless you have access to a skier or one
10894.859,of these um what are those things called
10897.14,the climber machines yeah the reversal
10898.88,climber the Versa climber that's the one
10900.68,the Versa climber
10902.18,um you can tell how often I do that one
10904.399,uh it's a great exercise so great piece
10906.68,of exercise equipment yeah so we're
10908.06,thinking how many how many
10910.819,how many exercises and in what order is
10913.399,it going to be two or three exercises
10914.84,since you're involving a lot of muscle
10916.22,groups typically that's a really
10917.96,distinction generally these are going to
10919.819,be total body movements so you can do
10922.16,something like a ski org if you want to
10923.6,really isolate your upper body great
10925.46,love that you can do lower body
10927.2,isolation like cycling right where
10929.42,everybody's not involved you can use
10931.22,weights here you can do some barbell
10933.68,movements and stuff like that
10936.2,they're just not my favorite choices for
10938.72,most people
10939.859,too many complexity things going on so
10941.899,uh I generally am going to pick total
10943.58,body movements uh pushing a sled
10945.76,dragging a sled sprinting uphill
10948.08,swimming these things like that are
10950.18,going to be good I'm seeing now why the
10952.64,assault bike is such a powerful tool
10954.14,because you're using your arms with some
10956.18,degree of resistance but not a lot of
10957.74,eccentric load plus legs some resistance
10960.439,not a lot of eccentric load and yet one
10962.42,can go quote unquote all out for 30 to
10965.24,60 seconds yep and and the consequences
10968.06,of a technical breakdown are minimal
10970.7,it's more like you're gonna actually
10972.26,have a worse performance rather than an
10973.819,injury rate so there's just a wonderful
10975.92,invention uh because of that where other
10979.279,things the consequences like say if
10980.899,you're going to be doing a barbell or
10982.16,kettlebell activity the consequences of
10984.439,making a technical mistake
10986.42,you might actually get an acute injury
10988.46,right there so they're just a little bit
10990.02,higher in the risk scale how many sets
10992.479,or sometimes referred to as repeats so
10995.12,how many 30 to 60 second
10997.46,all out sprints again doesn't have to be
11000.399,running sprinting but all out effort
11002.38,would be the better way to phrase it
11004.0,should I perform
11006.819,let's say per week right and then decide
11010.06,whether or not we can divide those up
11011.38,across multiple workouts or whether or
11012.76,not it's better to do them in the same
11013.779,workout yeah if you're staying with the
11015.939,same exercise for all of your workouts
11017.74,that's a little bit different answer
11018.88,than if you're if you're modifying them
11020.62,so say you're going to do this three
11021.7,times a week and you're gonna do an air
11023.859,bike one day you're gonna do some Hill
11025.72,Sprints another day and then you can do
11027.64,some swimming another day for sake of
11029.68,example I'm going to say
11031.72,um same movement
11033.22,because I think most people are going to
11034.899,be most comfortable with one or two
11037.12,types of movements unless they are
11040.02,really coordinated or an excellent
11042.16,athlete I think most people can probably
11043.84,find a hill that they could run up yeah
11045.819,and uh an aerodyne or assault bike a
11049.06,rower things of that sort yep you're
11051.64,gonna
11052.72,have a pro and a con here so the pro of
11055.54,doing less sets is you can actually
11058.3,train much closer to truly 100 percent
11061.779,the downside is volume slow
11064.18,okay so a major mistake people make here
11067.06,is they'll do something like
11069.64,um I'll do 20 seconds on 10 seconds off
11071.979,and I'll do that for 40 rounds
11074.5,you're not really actually going that
11075.88,hard on those 20 seconds so a key in
11077.859,fact if you look at the literature and
11079.06,all the buzz and all the positive
11081.1,benefits of high intensity neural
11083.26,training that assumes you are actually
11085.18,hitting very close to 100 percent
11088.24,if you're sliding down into like again
11090.1,moderate training stuff you start to
11092.5,actually be in a spot where you're not
11094.0,getting the total
11096.279,high-end stuff but you're not doing it
11098.74,long enough to get the low end stuff
11100.06,either and so you end up in this like
11101.56,you burn some calories you probably
11104.02,still enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis
11106.12,and a little bit of capitalization but
11107.68,you didn't really justify only doing
11109.6,three rounds
11110.979,that's where the problem comes in
11113.319,so in terms of a couple of protocols
11115.479,I'll give you how many sets per week
11117.34,it's it's really hard to give a number
11119.02,unlike the strength training stuff where
11121.18,it was easy to kind of land some stuff
11123.04,on a typical thing you'll see is like a
11125.26,minimum dose tends to be something like
11126.76,four rounds per day three times per week
11129.399,wow that's a lot so my once a week
11133.96,all-out effort of sprinting on the
11137.14,assault bike the so-called Airline bike
11139.68,for 60 seconds
11142.3,one to three rounds of that
11146.02,might be doing something useful for me
11147.939,but I should probably be doing that
11150.34,two or three times a week if you're
11152.62,gonna get to a max heart rate I
11154.06,generally like to say give me a minimum
11155.68,of one day a week two's better
11158.26,days per week how many rounds whatever
11160.84,it takes you to get to that maximum
11162.279,heart rate right so in your case you did
11164.08,one minute okay good if you're gonna
11166.359,extend past a minute or two
11169.24,one round might be enough so for example
11171.819,uh if you want to just do something
11173.8,where I'm going to run a mile as fast as
11176.14,I can that's all you need to do for the
11178.359,day you don't need to do multiple you
11180.279,can do mile repeats if you'd like but
11181.899,that is really really challenging I know
11183.22,we've extended the time duration here
11184.779,but I wanted to go there to show you
11187.779,the time domain matters here if you're
11189.58,doing something like a 20 second burst
11191.439,you're going to need more rounds if
11193.66,you're doing something longer like
11194.8,multiple minutes you don't need as many
11196.479,rounds to get there so in addition
11200.92,if you're really reaching past this
11204.819,um 90 seconds of of Hell window
11209.02,it's just going to do a lot more damage
11210.64,to the system not damaging than bad but
11212.38,as in there's a lot to recover here so
11214.18,we need more recovery time from that a
11217.06,20 second burst
11218.979,doesn't really challenge you challenge
11220.54,you in that 20 seconds but you'll be
11222.279,recovered and fine a three minute thing
11224.62,is going to hurt and it's going to hurt
11226.54,for many many minutes after that and
11228.52,you're going to still see maybe some
11230.2,performance decrements the next day
11232.12,depending on what your recovery stuff
11233.74,looks like so a couple of things to pay
11236.5,play with would be something like this
11238.6,if you want to try like a classic 30
11240.7,seconds on 30 seconds off protocol the
11243.22,literature will show like a minimum of
11244.72,four rounds of that probably three days
11246.7,a week so 30 seconds all out 30 seconds
11249.64,rest is one round repeat that four times
11252.3,at least once a week at least two would
11255.399,be better great right if you want to go
11258.22,something a lot longer than that you
11259.6,might be able to get away with one but
11262.18,generally two days a week of this is
11264.16,better if you start actually pushing
11266.02,past like three to four days a week up
11267.939,to five or six you may actually be
11269.26,causing some problems
11271.18,um there's just a little bit of excess
11274.359,fatigue that's going to happen there
11275.8,that you you maybe want to stay away
11277.0,from in fact you can see a lot of
11279.18,endocrinological problems and some other
11281.26,sleep issues and some other things kick
11282.88,in and we'll talk about more of those
11285.7,things as later but um that's the number
11287.68,to get with if you want to try something
11289.54,more like a 20 second burst I actually
11291.819,would recommend giving yourself more
11293.56,rest
11294.58,so you can actually do a higher rest
11298.359,than work ratio most people tend to
11300.46,think of this as doing like one to one
11301.96,20 seconds on 20 seconds off or lower I
11304.96,love doing like 20 seconds on 40 seconds
11307.06,off
11308.14,the quality of that 20 seconds becomes
11310.54,extraordinarily high and it's also
11312.34,possible to now get like six to eight
11314.319,rounds so as I'm hearing this I'm going
11316.72,to wager a uh an offer uh to you and if
11320.26,you say Okay
11321.819,um then to to those listening based on
11325.0,what you're telling me about the
11326.14,relationship between intensity and
11328.3,quality
11329.5,and the need for
11331.359,sufficient duration of this anaerobic
11333.46,work yeah
11335.26,how is five to six minutes per week of
11338.68,all out work that's pretty good so what
11341.439,that means for me is I would do three
11345.1,all out one minute sprints
11348.34,on one workout separated by a minute or
11351.399,two
11352.14,maybe more
11354.58,and I would do that two or three times
11356.979,per week
11358.06,just trying to hit that five or six
11359.92,minute per week threshold yep actually I
11362.56,think uh one of the uh
11364.359,Marty gabala is the scientist a Canadian
11368.2,uh guy amazing work he was done a lot of
11371.02,the the research on high intensity
11372.58,interval stuff right and I think the
11374.68,number he actually threw out there is
11377.38,some of his original research was
11378.7,comparing six total minutes of work to
11381.1,upwards of like 180 minutes of work
11383.62,throughout
11385.12,um the entire week and and one of the
11387.52,classic studies was looking at VO2 max
11389.14,improvements and he saw equal if not
11390.64,greater improving civil to Max with that
11392.38,so I think actually the name of his book
11394.24,might be like the six minute workout or
11396.16,something and so you'd like may have
11397.6,nailed that directly on the head uh
11399.819,purely by law but actually but I also
11401.859,may be wrong with the numbers we should
11402.76,probably fact check that yeah Will and
11404.439,also by inference from what you were
11406.06,saying you know if you're going to do
11406.899,this 20 seconds on 40 seconds off and
11408.88,you're doing more rounds or one minute
11410.68,all out so the way I'm going to think
11412.66,about this if it's okay with you is for
11416.859,five to six minutes a week
11418.72,I am sprinting yeah for my life correct
11422.38,but I'm sprinting for my life with good
11424.779,form in whatever movement I happen to be
11427.06,doing and I can do all of that in one
11429.16,workout but I'm separating out bouts of
11433.54,20 seconds all the way up to one minute
11436.18,yep by the necessary rest in order to
11439.479,recover my breathing get back to Pure
11441.64,nasal breathing maybe Zone one zone
11443.38,totally totally and then hit it again if
11445.6,you're gonna do the one minute thing
11446.56,like you do I actually generally
11448.18,encourage one to three minutes of rest
11450.04,before you do the next round and
11451.84,probably up to four to six rounds that
11453.58,would be your six minute number there
11454.899,now the caveat there is we don't worry
11457.18,about heart rate recovery we worry about
11459.1,exactly what you mentioned which is
11460.479,nasal only recovery once you can get
11462.76,back to that give yourself another 30
11464.979,seconds or so and then you're ready to
11466.84,go for round two this is where it gets
11469.12,fun because I can imagine challenging
11470.74,myself to get on the assault bike for
11472.72,one minute of kind of warm-up very low
11475.24,intensity each morning and then Sprint
11477.88,for a minute and then head off into my
11480.939,daily routine no okay that
11485.14,if you're going to do that though you
11486.64,need to give me three minutes of nasal
11488.68,only breathing before you go back to
11489.819,work
11490.479,we need to download and there are people
11492.7,in my life that would love for me to
11494.319,engage in more nasal breathing because
11495.52,it will have me speaking less so no
11497.68,problem chances are I'm going to use the
11500.979,um two or three workouts per week of a
11503.14,one minute all out maybe I'll try the
11505.3,shorter protocol can I give you one fun
11507.1,protocol to try here please so if you
11509.439,have a you can use this on any equipment
11512.02,um but I learned this from another
11513.22,mutual friend Kenny Kane this is a great
11516.34,little it's a little test a little a
11518.02,little game you can play with yourself
11519.1,and the only way to play this game is
11521.5,you're going to lose
11522.819,which is really really lovely so you can
11525.16,do this at any rate you can do this for
11527.74,any duration of time but two minutes is
11530.08,a good number Okay so you have to do
11532.84,this in somewhere where you can no
11534.58,distance so this could be running
11536.62,cycling the the air bike is what I use
11540.52,the first two minutes you're going to
11543.34,cover as much distance as you can
11545.74,possibly cover in two minutes
11548.38,and you're going to note that so let's
11550.6,say you covered
11552.279,400 meters
11554.02,right okay great you're going to rest
11557.319,for two minutes
11558.88,amazing that next round you're now going
11561.04,to go for distance so you're going to
11562.72,cover the exact same amount of distance
11563.92,you covered in round one which in this
11565.66,example is 400 meters
11567.819,and it doesn't matter how long it takes
11569.5,you
11571.06,it may take you two minutes and five
11572.62,seconds two minutes and 10 seconds
11574.359,because you're a little bit fatigued
11575.8,from round one round three you're gonna
11577.779,now come back and do that exact same
11579.46,time domain that you did in round two so
11582.04,if it took you two minutes and five
11583.54,seconds in round two now round three is
11585.819,going to last two minutes and five
11587.74,seconds and you want to see if you can
11589.24,cover a greater distance
11591.72,405 meters 410 meters and then you did
11595.06,in round one and the beauty of this
11596.62,little protocol six minutes total of
11599.26,work right
11600.52,but if you slack in one of the rounds
11603.399,you just make the next round harder is
11605.859,there any rest between rounds yeah two
11607.54,minutes
11608.68,always two minutes rest you don't have
11611.08,to but this would be my recommendation
11612.7,Kenny king came up with this I don't
11614.74,know if he came up with it he taught me
11616.0,this thing we both know Kenny and he's
11617.979,an incredibly nice and Incredibly
11619.899,skilled trainer um I'm gonna call it the
11622.42,sugar cane yeah it's so great because it
11624.64,sounds really painful and if you go out
11626.56,too hard in round one
11628.12,you're in such big trouble round two but
11630.88,if you go to Easy in round one you're
11632.56,going to get absolutely obliterated in
11634.479,round three so it's like a wonderful
11636.46,thing and you can pick that number as a
11639.16,standardization and then just try to
11640.3,improve that a little bit per week so
11642.16,progression is the last part of this
11644.2,whole thing that we haven't got to yet
11645.399,before we move on
11646.84,um and the way you want to progress all
11648.52,of these things
11649.96,is you can time stamp again how much
11652.54,work you can do and then just try to do
11653.979,a slightly higher amount of work five
11656.02,percent or so
11657.399,every week or you can add a round which
11661.24,is a really nice way so
11662.979,um uh in the in the research studies
11666.16,that have been done they're going to do
11667.54,things like week one you'll do three
11669.399,rounds week two you'll do four rounds
11671.56,three you'll go five rounds you'll like
11673.54,add a round until you get up to say six
11675.939,or seven or eight rounds at the end of
11677.8,the protocol so that's a really nice way
11679.479,to go about it or you can cap the rounds
11681.819,and just try to get more work done in
11683.8,that same amount of time meaning go more
11685.779,intensely correct get you know get
11687.939,further distance in your 30 seconds or
11689.68,your 45 seconds or whatever
11692.08,um I want to encourage people
11695.02,to go as low as 20 seconds
11697.66,that's going to allow you to go very
11699.22,very fast that's going to actually
11700.899,challenge that phospho creatine piece a
11703.3,little bit I want to encourage people to
11705.16,also go as high as 90 seconds so the
11707.92,honest way the way that I will do it not
11709.54,that it's about me but just as an
11711.399,example of something you could do I do
11713.74,something in the 15 to 22nd burst range
11716.979,and I will generally hedge towards a two
11719.979,to one rest to work ratio so I'm
11722.62,probably going to rest 40 to 60 seconds
11725.319,that's true that's to make sure that 20
11727.6,second burst is extremely high quality
11730.54,cool I'm also going to do something in
11732.939,the 30 to 50 second range okay I might
11736.6,go one-to-one work rest ratio
11738.819,the quality of those 30 seconds is going
11740.8,to come down
11741.819,but the acid buffering is going to be
11744.1,extraordinarily challenged
11746.2,I also will do that with a triple or
11749.38,quadruple rest range so again 30 seconds
11751.84,on maybe two minutes off
11754.42,now I won't be able to be I won't be
11757.12,working on my ability to handle
11760.0,um the waste product build up there but
11761.859,I'll be working on my ability to produce
11763.72,more force over that time which is
11765.7,another skill set and then all the way
11767.38,up to say what you do a minute 70
11769.0,seconds and you can go one to one there
11771.279,or up to three to one um you're gonna be
11773.74,working on a little bit of this
11774.52,different thing but that's exactly how
11775.96,we hit both sides of this equation
11777.58,working on dealing with waste as well as
11780.1,actually working on bringing in
11781.66,nutrients and getting that system a
11783.34,little bit more effective so you could
11785.26,set that up across your week
11786.88,and just it could be something like
11789.34,day one is that 20 second burst window
11792.16,day two is that maybe 60 second window
11795.34,and then day three is maybe one all-out
11798.399,effort
11799.72,and we're done there let's talk about
11801.46,the specific protocols and adaptations
11803.7,related to maximum aerobic output or
11807.819,maximum aerobic capacity as it's
11810.04,sometimes called sure now we're moving
11812.56,past like that couple of minute range
11814.479,into like the you know five to 15 minute
11817.479,range but at a maximum intensity so
11820.42,what's the highest you can go from there
11821.92,we're not talking about our last
11823.779,category of long duration here well the
11826.0,beautiful part is we've already
11827.439,explained a lot of it because it's very
11829.54,similar to what we just talked about
11830.859,with anaerobic capacity it is primarily
11833.92,going to be a problem
11835.779,I'm dealing with waste products
11837.22,especially at the end it's not enough
11839.08,total distance to be running out of
11841.3,muscle glycogen though it may start to
11843.7,creep down a little bit Fat's not going
11845.62,to be an issue but certainly more oxygen
11848.14,transportation is going to be an issue
11849.52,so we're just hedging a little bit more
11851.859,towards that side of the equation
11853.319,towards the end of that workout
11856.66,no doubt about it clearing out waste
11858.64,products is going to be a huge issue but
11861.34,really oxygen demand delivery is
11863.74,starting to take more of a prominent
11865.42,role because we have had more time to
11868.42,clear the waste and if we're not good at
11870.04,that we're going to be failing earlier
11872.68,than we need
11874.54,so the training for that needs to be a
11877.3,little bit
11878.26,at that exact same so a classic thing
11880.42,here is a one mile
11882.22,test right this is going to last for
11883.96,most people somewhere between five and
11885.58,ten minutes you're sort of right in this
11887.92,window if you just want to practice that
11890.08,once a week we're done here right
11891.939,exercise Choice same thing we talked
11894.88,about right pick an exercise you're
11896.38,comfortable with that you can actually
11897.7,do and you can progressively increase in
11901.42,terms of the intensity um you're not
11903.22,going to be you don't have to stop and
11904.899,change your exercise you're not going to
11906.279,move around it's like a circuit isn't
11907.96,great here because you got to put one
11910.06,Implement down pick up another one you
11911.8,want to be doing something where there
11912.939,is literally not a second of off switch
11915.04,so similar exercise Choice principles we
11917.8,just covered
11919.24,if you gonna become a real Savage and
11921.64,you want to do repeats here you can
11924.46,um endurance folks will do that a lot
11925.899,one of my repeats 800 meter repeats
11928.779,things like that or I'm not sure what
11930.16,the swimming distance equivalents would
11932.02,be but swimmers we do this constantly
11933.46,but you don't need to
11935.439,this is really hard it's pretty hard in
11937.359,the system it's very good for you one to
11939.46,twice a week of hitting this I think
11941.26,you'll be in a really really good spot
11942.899,frequency we sort of just covered we
11945.1,covered exercise Choice volume we just
11947.68,sort of nailed and intensity is
11949.12,basically running you up to the top
11951.76,there now because you can only do that
11954.1,so often you want to add in another 40
11957.819,or so percent of your time being lower
11960.16,intensity support work for that so this
11962.92,is something probably less than 85
11964.72,percent of your heart rate but higher
11966.939,than quote unquote zone two you got to
11968.979,be working here this is not I could have
11970.66,a conversation Pace this is higher than
11972.279,that it's in between conversation pace
11974.8,and the pace I need to be at to run my
11977.14,fastest mile I've ever done that's that
11979.06,middle ground and you need to train that
11981.22,so that you can continue to work on
11982.6,capitalization auctioning Transportation
11985.12,but you're not burning down the house
11987.16,getting all the way up to 100
11988.72,100 plus percent of your vo to Max
11991.779,could I use a uh accrued version of this
11995.859,where I say okay I'm going to exercise
11999.22,for 10 minutes I'm going to go as fast
12001.8,as I safely can
12003.479,and
12005.22,every week I'm going to measure how far
12008.04,I travel
12009.42,yep in that 10 minutes love it
12013.02,probably not on the same day that I'm
12014.7,doing the anaerobic capacity work
12016.56,probably not
12018.06,if you're probably okay to do after a
12022.02,strength training or hypertrophy workout
12024.84,as long as I didn't train legs you could
12029.04,um
12030.479,is probably going to compromise recovery
12033.06,is the way so I would if you're going to
12034.8,do a session like this I would probably
12036.0,do it on its own day unless you wanted
12038.22,to do something like speed or power
12040.38,then you could roll right into this and
12041.7,have no problem
12043.14,maybe a strength day a hypertrophy day
12046.62,I'm not sure
12048.12,um you would do there because again
12049.979,especially if you did any sort of lower
12051.779,body exercise you're going to be
12053.34,compromised here but remember these tend
12055.38,to be full body movements so even if you
12058.319,did arms that day your arms are going to
12059.7,be compromised and you don't want to
12061.2,fail this because of local muscular
12062.76,failure
12063.96,all right so now I've got my work cut
12065.58,out for me I'm going to be doing five to
12067.439,six minutes per week of all out work
12070.319,divided into 60 20 a 60 second
12073.68,bout with sufficient rest and I'm going
12076.68,to give myself 10 minutes a week of
12079.8,in my case it'll probably be running as
12082.14,fast as I can because I do enjoy running
12084.359,and I can do it safely
12086.279,um maybe uphill and see how far I go yep
12088.68,if you want to combine the two
12090.899,so if you're just saying hey I'm bought
12092.34,in Andy like I want to do both of these
12094.62,things they are similar but they have
12096.72,independent benefits I'm convinced how
12098.76,would I build these into the same week
12101.7,um maybe do one of each that still gets
12105.0,you at quote unquote two days per week
12106.319,where you're going to hit a hot maximum
12107.46,heart rate so we already checked that
12108.479,box off so one day can be a shorter
12110.64,length interval repeat one and the other
12112.62,one can simply be a 5 to 15 minute
12116.24,maximum work and you're done long
12119.34,duration
12120.96,endurance exercise the stereotypical
12123.54,endurance exercise sure
12126.479,how far how long how fast or how slow
12130.16,rather should I go and here I'm gonna
12136.04,Venture that exercise choice is one that
12139.68,we could click off even at this point in
12142.02,the discussion because obviously it's
12143.64,got to be something that I can do for a
12145.26,long while without getting injured uh
12148.68,overuse injuries
12150.899,um there's a little bit of novelty we
12152.399,can actually throw in here so
12154.74,one of the things I love to do for long
12158.1,duration and endurance for people who
12159.779,don't love running cycling or swimming
12161.7,is you can do a really cool workout any
12164.16,number of things where you can put a
12165.359,little circuit together as long as
12167.04,there's not a lot of downtime between
12168.84,one circuit to the next time you can
12171.18,actually do something as simple as like
12172.92,maybe you're going to do Farmer's
12175.319,carries and you'll do that for
12178.2,say three minutes and you'll set those
12179.88,down and you'll go straight into a plank
12182.04,for a minute and you'll pick that up and
12183.479,you go straight into maybe body weight
12185.16,squats for two minutes then you go
12187.38,straight into another exercise and you
12188.88,can sort of rotate things around maybe
12191.279,you can do even some like Shadow Boxing
12193.8,stuff or some jump rope you can do
12196.439,different gymnastics movements and body
12198.3,weight movements and you can run that
12200.22,thing through and you can basically get
12201.66,the exact same thing accomplished and
12203.7,not feel like you're doing oh my gosh
12206.279,this mind-numbing type of training if it
12208.5,feels like that to you another way you
12210.6,can do that to actually even simplify it
12212.22,even more we've done this at Kenny
12214.5,Kane's gym plenty of times where you
12216.06,just maybe even pick three machines so
12217.62,you're gonna I'm gonna go 10 minutes on
12219.12,the rower then I'm gonna go 10 minutes
12220.68,on the treadmill and I'm gonna go 10
12221.939,minutes on the bike you can actually
12223.56,knock a 30 minute quote-unquote steady
12225.72,state session out in and not feel those
12227.939,problems if those things happen so you
12229.739,can actually have a lot of fun there we
12231.0,will do a lot of times
12234.239,with our Fighters we'll do things like
12236.34,put a very low load I'm talking sub 50
12239.7,of your max on a barbell and you're
12242.939,gonna Squat and you're gonna do you know
12244.8,maybe a minute you're gonna put that
12247.14,down and then you're gonna go over and
12248.46,do 50 of a bench press you're gonna put
12250.2,that down you're gonna go over and do 50
12252.479,of uh
12253.92,of a crab walk and then you're gonna go
12255.899,over and do another one and you can
12257.1,actually run through this entire thing
12258.6,you don't hit that many reps in any
12260.88,individual movement the load is very
12262.8,very light and you can keep heart rate
12264.84,basically a steady state and do 15 or 20
12267.54,or 30 different exercises and it's
12270.06,actually like fairly fun and engaging to
12272.58,do and it's a little bit more specific
12274.02,than trying to get a 275 pound NFL
12277.739,player to run for 30 minutes which is
12280.26,not going to be good so I'm just
12282.3,chuckling because I love to run outdoors
12285.14,and I've enjoyed runs on all my travels
12288.72,and I find it to be a great way to see
12290.939,different places and I like moving
12292.859,through space but there are weather
12295.02,conditions and times when that's not an
12297.239,option so what you described is a
12298.56,terrific alternative I have to
12300.68,assume that the specific adaptation
12303.18,that's occurring here is related to the
12305.7,fat burning system
12307.26,and again that doesn't necessarily mean
12309.239,fat loss correct overall but fat burning
12311.819,system and yet I do have a question
12313.62,which is can you build enhanced
12316.64,microcapillary systems into the muscles
12319.319,uh by doing this long duration cardio
12321.84,yeah absolutely can in fact depending on
12324.479,which paper you uh like more than the
12326.939,other papers you may even find evidence
12329.64,that this is a superior method than
12332.819,anything else a steady state endurance
12334.88,is very important
12337.979,I used to not like it as much
12340.739,there's just so much evidence now that
12342.54,suggests it's probably a really good
12344.04,thing for basically everybody maybe for
12346.92,some individuals it's not in all year of
12350.22,their training but if if you're not a
12352.56,high-level athlete or have a very
12354.0,specific goal that's right in front of
12355.56,you it's probably best to do at least 20
12358.439,minutes as a minimum maybe 30 minutes of
12361.319,some steady state exercise once a week
12363.56,for basically any training goal outside
12367.319,of again a couple of really specific
12369.54,scenarios that are happening
12372.2,the other thing that kind of kicks in
12374.279,here that we haven't really talked about
12375.54,is now we're actually reaching a
12377.64,position where fatigue of the
12380.64,intercostal starts to play
12382.5,so diaphragmic fatigue starts to run an
12384.84,indication so we forget generally
12387.479,breathing is a contraction to open up
12390.54,the lungs to change pressure so the air
12392.52,will flow in and then the exhalation is
12394.859,passive right it's just a muscle's been
12396.779,stretched it goes back to it's resting
12398.22,when you get to a maximum heart rate
12400.08,inhalation and exhalation become active
12402.239,so you're squeezing as hard as you can
12403.8,to open up and you're squeezing to
12405.0,contract to blow air out
12406.92,you're going to get fatigued that system
12409.439,right over time you have contracted
12411.899,contracted open up if that system starts
12414.6,to get fatigued you start running into
12415.859,failure here so you need to practice
12417.6,that and this is when all kinds of
12419.46,things like breathing drills to just
12420.96,simply training in this fashion there's
12423.42,all kinds of exercise devices for your
12425.88,lungs and when we say that that's what
12427.319,we're really talking about the
12428.64,musculature around the lungs needs to
12431.34,not fatigue so that's the only other
12433.14,little component I wanted to throw in
12434.46,here if we're not talking about acid
12436.439,buffering
12437.52,which in this particular case is not a
12439.2,problem anymore
12440.359,the time domain is long and slower so we
12444.12,have plenty of time to use fat as a fuel
12445.979,we also have plenty of time to use
12447.66,anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis and
12450.239,clear out waste products so we don't
12452.1,really see pH being a problem with this
12455.16,type of exercise you may start running
12457.2,low on liver glycogen if you're going a
12459.359,very long time muscle glycogen may start
12461.64,getting low but not really these are
12463.859,huge issues you're going to run into
12465.96,maybe a little bit of stroke volume
12467.22,issue but and the intensity is not high
12469.8,enough to become a problem you're more
12471.72,likely to break down posturally or
12473.819,breathing mechanics than really anything
12475.26,else unless again that duration really
12477.42,gets generally past two hours for most
12480.239,people so those are the things that are
12482.399,going to limit us so how do we improve
12484.2,it what do we train we went through the
12485.76,exercise choices you also need to make
12487.739,sure you're training your intercostals
12489.96,we need to be training our diaphragm
12492.0,in some fashion again it can be the
12494.16,exercise itself can be your normal
12495.72,training
12497.34,the thing you need to be careful of here
12499.02,and this is actually true for all the
12500.88,things we just talked about
12502.38,when we think about fatigue and we think
12504.779,about failure and endurance we really
12507.42,need to pay attention to technical
12508.92,breakdown
12510.239,that is always the marker we look for so
12512.88,when we when we go through our stuff
12514.14,with our athletes and they quote unquote
12515.88,fail or they finish that's generally
12518.46,because we saw a massive technical
12520.02,breakdown you're done like you're over
12522.72,there it's not always the case during
12524.58,all year round of the training but this
12525.96,is something to really pay attention to
12527.34,so if you're on that bike and you're 40
12529.2,seconds in and all of a sudden posture
12530.7,starts punching over I may stop the test
12533.34,I may stop the training it's like no
12535.08,well we decided failure was is when you
12537.359,lost your Technique
12539.7,to some sufficient level so you want to
12542.34,pay attention to that too because that's
12543.6,going to determine your ability to
12544.68,perform well as well as maintain
12547.38,efficiency which is a really big problem
12549.18,here
12550.5,tell me if the protocol I'm about to
12552.42,describe would be a reasonable one for
12554.34,people to incorporate
12558.0,60
12559.439,to
12560.6,120 Minutes
12562.62,of long duration work per week
12566.16,so one way to accomplish that that I
12569.64,often use is to head out for a
12572.76,weight vested hike it's not a heavy
12575.819,weight vest it's maybe I think it's
12577.5,eight or ten pounds it's one of these
12579.12,thinner ones and if people don't have
12580.739,access to that you can bring a backpack
12583.2,with some items in it I mean it can be
12585.239,you don't even need external load it
12586.739,could just be your body okay great and
12588.84,and do some hiking at a at a fast enough
12591.72,clip that breathing harder than I would
12594.239,be if I just kind of shuffled along yeah
12596.279,I might stop here there drink some water
12597.899,no big deal
12599.22,but I can carry on a conversation if I
12601.62,need to so it's a Zone two-ish but
12604.02,probably pushing a little bit harder
12605.64,than that for that duration yeah not a
12608.7,lot of um deep soreness occurring after
12611.46,this maybe a little bit of achiness and
12613.14,some stabilization muscles that were
12614.76,used that may not be used Too Much
12616.5,especially if I've been sitting a lot
12618.0,during the week
12619.2,um kind of reminds me of how much I've
12620.52,been sitting but doing that all in one
12623.76,Long Afternoon
12625.62,um typically on a weekend or doing two
12628.62,shorter sessions throughout the week
12630.18,maybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes and then
12632.46,working up the progression to longer
12634.68,longer duration seems like that would be
12636.72,something that most people should be
12639.18,able to do yep and that it would weave
12642.359,in well with any resistance training or
12646.02,the uh anaerobic and aerobic output
12649.68,capacity work that we talked about just
12651.18,a moment ago great that's a fine version
12653.58,to do it if you want to go shorter and
12655.92,bring up the intensity a little bit so
12657.72,you want to keep it more to the 30 to 60
12659.88,Minute range and go you know closer into
12662.64,the I can't have a conversation right
12664.56,now but again I'm not at a blistering
12667.02,heart rate
12667.979,um then you could probably get that same
12669.0,thing done in a smaller time window if
12671.34,that was a consideration so if you
12673.439,wanted to blend all three of these
12674.939,together
12675.72,you have a lot of wiggle room right so
12678.12,you could do something like
12680.52,order
12682.08,if we're talking about this type of
12683.58,training you could do this first
12685.5,and then finish with either one of the
12687.84,higher intensity stuff we talked about
12689.16,so it could be roped into the same thing
12691.02,it could be its own independent day
12693.3,it could be your sort of active recovery
12695.04,day it tends to be fairly restorative as
12697.439,you alluded to a little bit there so
12699.479,it's not that big a deal to do this on
12700.8,your quote-unquote off day if you're
12702.0,those
12702.779,if you're that type of person who like
12704.399,even on your off day you have to do
12705.96,something physical
12707.34,this is fine right if you wanted to do
12710.1,it on a lifting day
12711.66,especially if it's a power or strength
12713.399,date it's probably fine if you wanted to
12715.319,do it before the workout or after it
12716.939,either way you're probably okay probably
12719.279,best to do it after
12721.38,if the primary goal is one of the
12723.06,strength training adaptations if it's
12724.38,not if this is a primary goal do it
12726.72,first
12727.5,amazing if you wanted to do it in the
12730.739,combination
12732.3,with the other interval stuff you could
12733.859,do it fine there you could do it before
12735.18,or you could do it afterwards I actually
12737.279,have no problem doing it afterwards
12738.84,because that in effect
12741.899,especially if you say nasal only during
12744.18,this training will help the down
12745.68,regulation go and so you could finish
12747.6,that fairly well down regulated actually
12749.58,so it's kind of like a nice way to get
12752.04,thoroughly warmed up
12753.84,go really really hard and then give it a
12756.42,nice 20 to 30 minute slow back down and
12759.72,by the time you finish maybe even on a
12762.12,three minute walk
12767.42,nice slow nasal breathing four second
12770.22,inhale
12771.979,four seconds and yeah maybe five even
12774.66,play with the numbers a little bit then
12776.46,maybe you don't even need to do the down
12777.6,regulation breathing afterwards you'll
12778.859,be in a good spot what you wouldn't want
12780.54,to do this before do your intervals
12782.939,finish your intervals throw up lay on
12785.16,the ground sweat all over the gym floor
12786.66,get up and go back to work that's
12788.399,probably not our best strategy
12790.5,as people are hearing this all they may
12793.439,be thinking wow this is a lot of work to
12795.06,do but I've been keeping track of the
12796.739,math here as I'm sure some of you out
12798.96,there are as well and we're really
12800.279,talking about
12801.54,10 minutes of the of running or
12804.54,sprinting on the bike or rower once a
12807.6,week we're talking about six minutes or
12809.22,so of the much higher intensity but
12811.92,short bouts divided into rounds of 20 to
12814.14,20 seconds to a minute with with rest in
12816.479,between and then some longer duration
12818.1,work out of
12819.3,30 minutes minimum but maybe as much as
12821.819,an hour even two hours which in total
12824.279,doesn't really equate to that much time
12826.68,especially if one can access these
12828.84,things right out their front door or at
12830.34,home and as we point out you don't need
12832.56,any specialized equipment to do that
12834.899,oh and I forgot the um muscular
12838.02,endurance
12839.06,that I wasn't trying to cheat there
12841.56,um some muscular endurance
12843.54,thrown in as well so that brings me to a
12846.96,question which is
12848.58,if I'm doing my training for muscular
12850.68,endurance each week for anaerobic
12852.6,capacity and for maximum aerobic output
12856.08,and long duration and given that all of
12859.439,that is going to take roughly two hours
12861.359,for the typical person total for the
12863.58,entire week which I would argue is going
12866.1,to give you back so much life literally
12868.56,in terms of longevity you're literally
12870.0,going to earn back years of your life
12871.439,productivity you name it offsetting all
12873.96,sorts of uh metabolic issues and uh
12876.779,enhancing your sleep and improving mood
12879.72,I mean there's so much data so much data
12882.6,pointing to all those positive benefits
12884.88,if I do all of these things
12887.34,and I'm fairly consistent about them am
12889.979,I going to be metabolically flexible am
12892.859,I going to have a well-developed
12896.04,fat burning
12897.479,carbohydrate burning system and
12901.02,will I be essentially fit I mean this is
12904.2,not leaving aside issues of strength and
12905.939,hypertrophy which were covered in the
12907.859,previous episode
12909.239,will I be fit I mean to my mind the
12912.54,ability to you know Sprint very fast if
12915.239,one needs to the ability to go longer
12916.979,duration if one needs to and the ability
12918.779,to do something in between as well as
12920.399,you know hold a box overhead if
12922.5,necessary while installing a shelf or
12924.479,something like that these are the
12925.8,realities of life and to me represent
12928.56,real functional World Fitness if that's
12931.08,the case is there anything that we would
12932.939,want to add to this program or would you
12934.38,consider that a fairly comprehensive and
12936.239,complete endurance training system if we
12939.12,remember the target which is I want to
12942.42,have energy
12943.8,I want to look a certain way and you
12946.92,want to be able to do that for the
12947.88,duration of your life for a very long
12949.68,life
12951.06,this style of training where you
12952.92,incorporate all of those areas of
12954.66,endurance
12955.56,gives you all of the necessary
12957.42,adaptations one would need to execute
12959.88,all of those things remember
12963.3,fat loss or Weight Management
12966.479,is not best done with any individual
12969.18,style of protocol so if you do a little
12971.22,bit of all three of these you've checked
12972.6,that fat loss box you don't need to go
12974.04,out and do anything separate for it
12976.08,you've done all the things then to cover
12978.42,Aesthetics
12979.739,from that side of the equation right
12981.72,you've done the things to both enhance
12984.06,mitochondria
12985.739,to enhance blood flow increase
12988.08,oxygenation and manage fatigue and waste
12992.1,development boom energy is there fatigue
12995.64,is there I'm not going to get tired or
12997.38,have to quit or stop or sit down doing
12999.18,any of these activities I want at the
13001.46,same time if you look at the literature
13003.56,on mortality one of the strongest
13006.02,predictors of how long you're going to
13008.0,live is your VO2 max
13010.16,so we've set up a scenario in which
13012.56,you're going to hit all three of those
13014.42,primary goals by doing a combination of
13016.7,this training you're not going to miss
13018.8,any plausible adaptation from endurance
13021.14,training and you should be set for
13023.06,regardless of your goal
13025.34,incredible and as I understand totally
13029.06,compatible with strength and hypertrophy
13031.58,training provided that your goal is to
13034.22,also be strong
13035.72,and also selectively hypertrophy or
13038.84,generally hypertrophy your muscles or
13040.46,maintain your muscles
13042.5,for many people that are listening to
13044.54,this I'm guessing that they have an
13047.239,interest in building more endurance but
13049.76,not just the ability to go further but
13051.68,the ability to go a given distance at a
13054.56,higher speed and to do it with better
13056.0,form and to breathe better and to feel
13058.76,better before during and after
13061.52,for those folks maybe you could spell
13064.279,out a program that combines these
13066.26,different elements of endurance
13068.18,and does so in a way that informs how
13070.52,for instance the higher intensity short
13073.76,duration Sprints would be expected to
13077.3,improve their longer duration work and
13079.7,how perhaps their longer duration work
13081.7,can progress if they are careful to
13084.739,include some planks and some wall sets
13087.08,and and things of that sort
13089.239,I asked this question specifically
13090.92,because I have to believe that while
13093.439,there probably are some folks out there
13094.76,they're looking to just maximize their
13096.56,plank from week to week to week
13098.6,typically it seems that people fall into
13100.46,these categories of either wanting to
13101.96,get stronger and get bigger muscles to
13104.479,varying degrees or to get better at
13107.0,endurance or to get better at everything
13108.979,overall right now I'd really like to
13110.72,just focus on what you think is a nice
13113.12,Contour of a program for the person that
13115.76,wants to get better at endurance but do
13118.1,it with more speed more stability and
13120.859,just feel like a strong endurance Runner
13123.5,cycle or swimmer or whatever happened to
13126.26,be their endurance event okay great so
13128.84,let's just give an example maybe you
13130.7,want to run your first half marathon
13132.8,something like that okay or maybe done a
13135.14,couple times before but you want to get
13136.399,better at that time I would probably put
13139.16,somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to
13140.66,70 percent of your you know mileage in
13144.26,the moderate intensity Zone okay so you
13146.72,need to accumulate mileage and you need
13148.76,to be able to handle what we call the
13150.08,tissue tolerance so in this case your
13152.12,feet need to be able to handle 13 miles
13154.52,of pounding okay it doesn't matter how
13156.739,much high heart rate training you do or
13158.899,your fat deliverability none of that
13161.479,matters if your feet are blown up by
13163.58,mile eight Okay so
13165.8,in addition we talked about how even
13168.319,training in that 70 to 85 percent heart
13171.26,rate zone is quite effective at oxygen
13174.56,delivery fat utilization capitalization
13177.2,Etc so you're going to get a lot of
13178.64,direct endurance benefits from that work
13180.5,you're also going to be working on
13182.18,what's honestly going to be one of your
13183.62,limiting factors which is that tissue
13185.96,tolerance and that pounding okay in
13188.42,addition you need to be efficient with
13189.979,your Technique and you need a lot of
13191.84,repetitions for motor skill development
13194.3,so you want to spend most your time
13196.04,there it's easy to recover from it's not
13198.319,extremely
13199.779,demanding and challenging awesome that
13202.52,leaves you with another 30 or 40 percent
13204.08,of training I would spend 10 percent of
13206.6,that in that like 20 second burst area
13209.779,you're going to drive up fatigue
13212.0,extremely high and you're going to
13213.8,really maximize your ability to recover
13215.72,from waste production all right great I
13219.739,would spend the remaining amount of time
13221.359,either on a little bit of actually
13223.04,maximum speed stuff
13224.899,that could actually be in the 20 second
13226.46,burst if you're really trying to go as
13227.96,fast as you can
13229.16,at the beginning of that exercise
13231.439,and then the rest of it I would spend in
13233.12,that other Zone which is more of like
13234.859,the five to 15 minutes but you're
13237.979,probably going to want to repeat those
13239.18,and this is when things like 800 meter
13241.88,run rest for double the time
13245.479,and then repeat that two or three times
13247.04,you actually need that in this scenario
13249.56,because you're gonna need to be able to
13251.0,be running for two most people are gonna
13253.279,do a half marathon and maybe around two
13254.6,hours or so something like that and so
13257.3,you want a little bit of what we call
13258.62,repeated endurance right so be able to
13261.5,handle that higher heart rate come back
13263.42,down do it again at the same time that's
13266.06,actually how you bump your mileage up
13268.16,so instead of having this do more of
13270.26,these long duration distance runs you
13272.84,can still get maybe five or six miles
13274.819,down in a day if you're going to do a
13276.62,one mile repeat
13278.239,or whatever number you're looking at so
13279.979,for a lot of people that's kind of how I
13282.56,would structure it um that's honestly
13284.479,it's very similar to what we laid out in
13286.399,the previous conversation which is
13287.899,getting to this idea that more than 50
13290.54,percent should be basically practice
13293.12,a little bit of work at the very top end
13295.64,of the spectrum but not too much and
13297.08,then a little bit of work at the other
13298.34,end and you should be in a good spot a
13300.859,major mistake one would make here is
13302.479,only doing the long duration steady
13304.1,state stuff and just sort of saying I'm
13306.02,gonna run a five mile this was a week
13307.76,and then do six miles next week and
13309.26,seven I said that might work for you
13311.239,it's I think we have enough evidence at
13313.46,this point both in the scientific realm
13315.319,as well as most of the coaches I think
13317.359,in this space would agree with me is
13318.56,that's a sub-optimal strategy so it
13321.2,could work but we can do better and in
13323.42,terms of the structure of a program like
13325.52,this I realize that those structures
13327.92,vary tremendously different coaches and
13329.779,different books and different programs
13331.04,are going to say oh you should run
13332.12,Monday through Friday with weekends off
13333.859,or every other day but in terms of this
13336.739,70 percent
13338.54,um thirty percent divide where seventy
13340.279,percent is going toward the specific
13341.72,event you know doing the kind of work
13343.939,that you're going to do during this
13345.439,specific event that you're most
13347.0,interested in cultivating or improving
13349.1,and the remaining 30 coming from other
13351.08,sorts of uh of supporting were work
13354.7,how should one thing about Distributing
13356.899,that other thirty percent should it be
13358.7,all geared towards maximizing recovery
13360.739,for the 70 or in other words
13364.58,um could I do all that 30 work on one
13368.54,day I probably would split it into two
13370.279,days
13371.3,um that's the reality is so if you're
13372.92,thinking man coach wants me to train six
13376.16,days a week my schedule is tight I can
13378.319,pull off four to five
13379.939,okay great what I might say is two of
13382.399,those days are just your your tempo
13384.859,right this is what like a runner would
13386.42,call this like Tempo training I'm kind
13388.46,of in that space remind us what tempo
13390.08,training is
13391.479,80 effort range where you're like
13394.279,running at probably the same stride
13396.8,length and and rate that you're gonna
13398.42,run your race at maybe a little bit
13399.979,lower but something similar you're
13401.84,practicing skill you're accruing mileage
13404.479,and you're getting a little you're
13405.979,getting work in for sure work but it's
13408.2,not absolutely the fastest you can
13410.12,Sprint it's also not conversation so
13412.64,this would be the um what before we
13415.34,refer to as the 10 minutes of of fast
13417.8,running or ten minutes of fast run this
13420.08,is lower intensity than that got it this
13422.239,is uh
13423.739,this is work accumulation got it this is
13426.62,practice stuff
13428.0,um then one of the days a week I would
13429.979,probably enter in that 22nd 30 second
13433.939,burst for a little bit of speed there
13435.439,and then one of the other days is when I
13436.939,would do that true high intensity as
13439.399,hard as I can for hitting a VO2 max
13442.64,something like that so that's probably
13444.26,how I'd break it up if I had like four
13445.76,days a week if you had five you can
13447.62,maybe add in another day where you do
13450.02,more of that volume accumulation
13452.42,practice work but that's that's a pretty
13454.88,good split well this is the point in the
13457.22,episode where I say
13459.2,thank you ever so much you provided an
13461.54,enormous amount of incredibly
13464.06,interesting clear information that's
13466.52,also actionable
13468.08,I do feel as if I far better understand
13470.3,endurance in its many forms and even the
13474.02,seller underpinnings of that and even
13476.06,sub-seller underpinnings of what
13478.04,endurance adaptations are and how to
13480.8,Foster those through specific protocols
13482.66,things that not only I can do tomorrow
13484.52,but that I will do tomorrow and where I
13487.22,hit my pain points I'll understand
13488.54,what's happening and the adaptation that
13490.76,I'm triggering when my legs are burning
13492.859,or I'm sucking for air through my mouth
13494.54,or I can calmly move along just through
13497.479,nasal breathing I will now know what's
13499.76,happening in my body and the specific
13501.5,adaptations that I'm triggering I think
13503.479,you also highlight something that is
13505.399,vitally important and I've never heard
13507.5,it phrased as clearly as you did today
13509.6,which is that it really doesn't matter
13511.34,how one seeks out to achieve fat loss
13514.16,provided certain criteria are met
13517.279,even while certain forms of exercise tap
13519.92,into fat stores more than others and you
13522.979,beautifully Illustrated the relationship
13525.08,between energy utilization and breathing
13527.479,and the fact that we literally exhale
13530.359,fat to some extent of course
13533.359,so once again thank you thank you and
13536.12,thank you I know I'm not alone in um
13538.88,recognizing this information as
13540.56,incredibly interesting and actionable
13542.72,and indeed I do plan to put it into
13544.52,action as I hope many of our listeners
13546.439,will as well
13548.06,yet again the pleasure is actually all
13550.04,mine and uh I actually really appreciate
13552.14,the fact that you let me go so far into
13554.6,metabolism my PhD is in human
13557.06,bioenergetics so anytime I can go many
13560.12,hours into metabolism I get very excited
13562.34,and I don't typically get that leash
13565.1,um in this format so I appreciate that I
13567.02,know
13567.739,you understand your audience will love
13569.239,that hopefully Oh They'll love it and I
13571.819,think that they'll especially love it
13573.2,because they understand that if one can
13577.279,wrap their head around even just a small
13579.439,fraction of the mechanisms that underlie
13581.96,a given protocol it gives both
13583.819,tremendous depth and meaning to that
13585.38,protocol and makes it so much more
13587.12,flexible for people they can really
13589.04,think about what's happening as they're
13590.6,engaging in a given protocol and know
13592.58,exactly what they can expect in terms of
13594.439,results Great we've been on a bit of a
13597.319,journey here we've covered a lot of
13599.42,ground with speed development and
13601.22,strength and hypertrophy and now we walk
13603.5,through you know probably several hours
13605.239,here of of endurance what I would love
13608.0,to do next is to just give you a more
13611.479,straightforward
13612.739,not as much background not as much
13615.26,metabolism none of the mechanisms right
13618.14,into protocols for someone who says look
13620.84,I want to hit those marks you keep
13622.46,talking about I want to look good I want
13624.56,to feel good and I want to do that
13625.88,across my lifespan how would I build all
13628.52,these things into a protocol that
13631.76,actually covers maybe the entire year
13634.46,and how would I would be able to repeat
13635.779,that year after year so I almost have
13637.64,this Evergreen sustainable year-long
13640.7,periodization structure that covers all
13643.1,the nodes I need to if I want everything
13645.859,we've talked about in these nine
13647.18,adaptations in this short Series so I
13650.3,would love to do that in our next
