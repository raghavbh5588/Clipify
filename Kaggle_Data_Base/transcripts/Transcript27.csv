0.3,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.25,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.89,for everyday life. 
5.939,[lively music] 
9.15,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.17,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.17,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.09,"Today, my guest is Dr. Erich Jarvis. "
17.73,Dr. Jarvis is a professor at the Rockefeller University 
20.52,in New York City 
21.93,"and his laboratory studies, "
23.58,"the neurobiology of vocal learning, language, "
26.67,"speech disorders, "
28.08,"and remarkably, the relationship between language, "
30.87,"music and movement, in particular dance. "
34.53,"His work spans from genomics, "
37.2,so the very genes that make up our genome 
40.86,and the genomes of other species 
42.69,that speak and have language 
44.28,such as songbirds and parrots 
46.86,"all the way up to neural circuits, "
48.42,that is the connections in the brain and body 
50.7,that govern our ability to learn 
52.53,and generate specific sounds 
54.21,"and movements coordinated with those sounds, "
56.22,including hand movements 
58.17,"and all the way up to cognition, "
61.29,"that is our ability to think in specific ways, "
64.05,based on what we are saying 
65.55,and the way that we comprehend 
67.35,"what other people are saying, singing and doing. "
70.86,"As you'll soon see, "
72.36,I was immediately transfixed 
74.67,and absolutely enchanted by Dr. Jarvis's description 
78.03,of his work and the ways that it impacts 
80.28,all the various aspects of our lives. 
82.53,"For instance, I learned from Dr. Jarvis that as we read, "
86.31,we are generating very low-levels 
88.65,of motor activity in our throat. 
90.96,"That is, we are speaking the words that we are reading "
94.38,at a level below the perception of sound 
96.93,or our own perception of those words. 
99.3,But if one were to put an amplifier 
100.89,or to measure the firing of those muscles 
103.95,"in our vocal chords, "
105.24,"we'd find that as we're reading information, "
107.25,we are actually speaking that information. 
109.83,"And as I learned, and you'll soon learn, "
111.87,there's a direct link between those species 
114.36,"in the world that have song and movement, "
117.39,which many of us would associate with dance 
119.49,and our ability to learn and generate complex language. 
123.51,"So for people with speech disorders like stutter, "
126.54,or for people who are interested 
127.89,"in multiple language learning, "
129.9,"bilingual, trilingual, et cetera, "
131.94,and frankly for anyone who is interested 
134.34,"in how we communicate through words, written or spoken, "
138.06,I'm certain today's episode is going to be 
139.77,an especially interesting and important one for you. 
142.68,Dr. Jarvis's work is so pioneering 
144.78,that he has been awarded truly countless awards. 
147.21,I'm not going to take our time to list off 
149.07,"all the various important awards that he's received, "
152.19,but I should point out 
153.09,that in addition to being a decorated professor 
155.79,"at the Rockefeller University, "
157.26,he is also an investigator 
158.4,"with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, "
160.17,the so-called HHMI. 
162.027,"And for those of you that don't know, "
163.83,HHMI investigators are selected 
166.32,on an extremely competitive basis 
169.05,"that they have to re-up, "
170.61,that is they have to recompete every five years. 
173.13,They actually receive a grade every five years 
176.04,that dictates whether or not they are no longer 
178.32,a Howard Hughes investigator 
179.94,or whether or not they can advance to another five years 
183.27,of funding for their important research. 
185.4,"And indeed, Howard Hughes investigators "
186.84,"are selected not just for the rigor of their work, "
189.6,but for their pioneering spirit 
191.22,"and their ability to take on high-risk, high-benefit work, "
195.45,which is exactly the kind of work 
196.74,that Dr. Jarvis has been providing for decades now. 
200.22,"Again, I think today's episode is one of the more unique "
202.53,and special episodes that we've had 
204.0,on the Huberman Lab Podcast. 
205.17,I single it out because it really spans 
207.69,from the basic to the applied 
209.49,and Dr. Jarvis's story is an especially unique one 
212.16,in terms of how he arrived at becoming a neurobiologist. 
215.07,So for those of you that are interested 
216.84,"in personal journey and personal story, "
218.82,Dr. Jarvis's is truly a special and important one. 
222.72,I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast 
224.58,is now partnered with Momentous supplements. 
226.89,We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons. 
229.14,"First of all, they ship internationally "
230.85,because we know that many of you 
232.2,are located outside of the United States. 
234.24,"Second of all, and perhaps most important, "
236.25,"the quality of their supplements is second to none, "
238.8,both in terms of purity and precision 
240.48,of the amounts of the ingredients. 
242.43,"Third, we've really emphasized supplements "
245.04,"that are single ingredient supplements, "
247.11,and that are supplied in dosages that allow you 
250.02,to build a supplementation protocol 
252.27,"that's optimized for cost, "
254.13,"that's optimized for effectiveness, "
255.99,and that you can add things and remove things 
258.15,from your protocol in a way 
259.47,that's really systematic and scientific. 
261.24,If you'd like to see the supplements 
262.44,"that we partner with Momentous on, "
263.76,you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman. 
266.85,"There, you'll see those supplements. "
267.99,And just keep in mind 
269.01,that we are constantly expanding 
270.45,the library of supplements available through Momentous 
273.15,on a regular basis. 
274.11,"Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. "
276.63,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
279.03,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
281.7,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
283.5,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
286.08,and science-related tools to the general public. 
288.66,"In keeping with that theme, "
289.65,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
292.35,Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. 
294.63,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
296.91,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
299.37,to help you better meet your immediate 
300.84,and long-term health goals. 
302.43,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
305.19,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
307.41,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
309.24,can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. 
312.0,"And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA test, "
314.22,"you can also get insight into, for example, "
316.08,what your biological age is 
317.46,and compare that to your chronological age. 
319.44,The problem with a lot of DNA tests 
321.45,"and blood tests, however, "
322.8,"is you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids, "
326.37,"and hormones, and so forth, "
327.45,but you don't know what to do 
328.83,with or about that information. 
330.78,InsideTracker solves that problem with a simple platform 
333.54,"that allows you to click on any specific factor, "
336.15,"learn more about it and what it does in your brain and body, "
338.7,and also the various nutritional supplementation 
341.4,and other types of interventions you can take 
343.23,to bring the levels of that factor 
345.39,into the ranges that are optimal for you and your health. 
349.05,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "

359.7,Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. 
362.1,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses 
364.02,that are of the absolute highest quality. 
365.88,They also have some really unique features 
367.92,that make them especially attractive 
370.11,from the standpoint of aesthetics and performance. 
373.38,The company was founded by two 
374.52,all-American swimmers from Stanford 
375.93,and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses 
377.88,were designed with performance in mind. 
379.89,"Initially, the eyeglasses and sunglasses "
381.69,"were designed for sport, "
382.71,"that is for running and for cycling, et cetera. "
384.72,"And indeed, still their eyeglasses "
386.55,and sunglasses are very lightweight 
388.08,"and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty, "
390.21,but they also have a terrific aesthetic. 
392.07,You can wear them to work. 
393.3,You can wear them out to eat. 
394.68,"I wear readers at night when I work, or if I drive "
397.86,and I wear sunglasses sometimes 
399.33,"during the middle of the day, "
400.62,if it's too bright and I need sunglasses in order to see. 
403.35,"If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses, or sunglasses, "
405.99,"you can go to ROKA, that's ROKA.com "
408.51,and enter the code huberman 
409.83,to save 
20%,off your first order. 
411.57,"Again, that's ROKA.com "
413.37,and enter the code huberman at checkout. 
415.41,Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. 
418.23,LMNT is an electrolyte drink 
419.85,"that has everything you need and nothing you don't, "
422.49,"meaning no sugar, but plenty of the correct ratios "
427.11,"of sodium, magnesium and potassium, "
429.72,"and those three electrolytes, "
431.28,"sodium, magnesium, and potassium "
432.54,"are critical for your neuron, your nerve cell function, "
435.03,and for the function of all the cells 
436.86,in your brain and body. 
438.54,"I've mentioned this before on the podcast, "
440.49,"but I'm a fan of salt, "
442.56,"not taking too much salt, "
443.97,but certainly not getting too little salt. 
446.31,LMNT has 
1000,"milligrams, that is one gram of salt, "
449.16,which might sound like a lot of salt. 
450.6,"But for many people, "
451.433,"especially people who are following low carbohydrate diets, "
454.2,"or who are exercising or sweating a lot, or both, "
457.68,that level of salt can actually help you 
459.9,in many circumstances. 
461.07,"Getting the appropriate level of salt, "
462.48,and certainly the appropriate levels of electrolytes 
464.22,will improve your cognitive function 
465.69,and will improve your physical performance. 
468.15,If you'd like to try LMNT 
469.23,"you can go to drinklmnt, that's lmnt.com/huberman, "
473.4,and you'll get a free sample pack with your order. 
475.5,That's drinklmnt.com/huberman. 
478.95,"And now, for my discussion with Dr. Erich Jarvis. "
482.37,"Erich, it's so great to have you here. "
484.08,- Thank you. - Yeah. 
485.34,Very interested in learning from you 
487.2,about speech and language. 
489.9,"And even as I ask the question, "
492.0,"I realize that a lot of people, including myself, "
494.79,probably don't fully appreciate the distinction 
497.25,"between speech and language, right? "
499.56,"Speech, I think of as the motor patterns, "
501.45,the production of sound 
503.97,"that has meaning, hopefully. "
505.74,"And language, of course, comes in various languages "
509.13,and varieties of ways of communicating. 
511.86,"But in terms of the study of speech and language, "
514.74,and thinking about how the brain 
516.57,"organizes speech and language, "
518.73,what are the similarities? 
520.41,What are the differences? 
521.4,How should we think about speech and language? 
523.17,"- Yeah, well, I'm glad you, you know, inviting me here. "
526.8,"And I'm also glad to get that first question, "
530.13,which I consider a provocative one. 
532.59,"The reason why, I've been struggling, "
535.44,what is the difference with speech and language 
537.39,for many years. 
538.68,"And realize, why am I struggling, "
540.65,"is because there are behavioral terms, "
543.12,"let's call 'em psychologically, "
544.92,psychology developed kind of terms 
547.74,that don't actually align exactly with brain function. 
552.24,All right. 
553.073,And the question is there a distinction 
554.43,between speech and language? 
555.66,And when I look at the brain 
557.43,"of work that other people have done, work we have done, "
560.07,"also compared it with animal models, "
561.9,like those who can imitate sounds 
563.4,like parrots and songbirds. 
565.59,I start to see there really isn't such a sharp distinction. 
570.21,"So, to get at what I think is going on, "
572.37,let me tell you how some people think of it now. 
575.7,That there's a separate language module in the brain 
579.45,that has all the algorithms and computations 
582.27,that influence the speech pathway 
584.28,on how to produce sound 
586.32,and the auditory pathway on how to perceive 
589.11,and interpret it for speech 
591.93,"or for, you know, sound that we call speech. "
595.14,"And it turns out, "
598.62,I don't think there is any good evidence 
600.6,for a separate language module. 
602.55,"Instead, there is a speech production pathway "
607.23,"that's controlling our larynx, "
608.61,controlling our jaw muscles 
610.5,that has built within it 
612.75,all the complex algorithms for spoken language. 
616.11,And there's the auditory pathway 
618.63,"that has built within it, "
619.98,"all the complex algorithms for understanding speech, "
622.92,not separate from a language module. 
625.26,And this speech production pathway 
627.57,is specialized to humans 
630.12,"and parrots and songbirds, "
632.52,whereas this auditory perception pathway 
635.22,is more ubiquitous amongst the animal kingdom. 
638.13,"And this is why dogs can understand, "
639.847,"""sit"", ""sientese"", ""come here, boy"", "
643.297,"""get the ball"" and so forth. "
644.82,Dogs can understand several hundred human speech words. 
648.54,"Great apes, you can teach them for several thousand, "
651.27,but they can't say a word. 
653.76,- Fascinating. 
655.32,Because you've raised a number of animal species 
658.08,"early on here and because I have a, "
660.9,basically an obsession with animals 
662.34,"since the time I was very small, "
663.57,"I have to ask, which animals have language? "
668.97,Which animals have modes of communication 
671.97,that are sort of like language. 
674.215,- [Erich] Yeah. 
675.048,"- You know, I've heard whale songs. "
676.32,I don't know what they're saying. 
677.49,"They sound very beautiful, "
678.54,but they could be insulting each other for all I know. 
681.06,- [Erich] Yeah. 
681.893,- And they very well may be. 
684.18,"Dolphins, birds, I mean, "
687.27,what do we understand about modes of communication 
690.48,"that are like language, "
692.79,but might not be what would classically be called language? 
696.39,"- Yes, right. "
697.8,"So, modes of communication "
700.56,"that people would define as language, "
703.32,"more, very, in a very narrow definition, "
706.2,"they would say, production of sound, so speech. "
709.92,"But what about the hands, the gesturing with the hands? "
712.65,"What about a bird who is doing aerial displays in the air, "
716.25,"communicating information through body language, right. "
720.66,"Well, I'm going to go back to the brain. "
723.75,So what I think is going on 
726.75,"is for spoken language, "
728.97,we're using the speech pathway 
730.95,and all the complex algorithms there. 
733.02,Next to the brain regions 
734.55,that are controlling spoken language 
736.29,are the brain regions for gesturing with the hands. 
739.53,And that hand parallel pathway 
742.26,has also complex algorithms that we can utilize. 
745.41,"And some species are more advanced in these circuits, "
748.59,whether it's sound or gesturing with hands 
751.32,and some are less advanced. 
753.9,"Now, we, humans and a few others "
755.94,are the most advanced for the speech sounds 
759.87,"or the spoken language, "
761.37,but a non-human primate can produce gesturing 
765.3,in a more advanced form than they could produce sound. 
769.17,"I'm not sure I got that across clearly, "
771.39,just to say that humans are the most advanced 
774.99,"at spoken language, "
776.97,but not necessarily as big a difference at gestural language 
781.29,compared to some of the species. 
783.3,- Very clear and very interesting. 
785.7,"And immediately prompts the question, "
788.46,have there been brain imaging 
789.96,or other sorts of studies evaluating neural activity 
794.67,"in the context of, you know, cultures and languages, "
798.15,"at least that I associate with a lot of hand movement, "
800.34,like Italian. - Yep. 
801.6,"- Versus, I don't know, "
803.28,maybe you could give us some examples of cultures 
805.2,where language is not associated with 
807.9,as much overt hand movement. 
809.49,"- Yes, so as you and I are talking here today "
812.73,"and people who are listening, but can't see us, "
815.04,we're actually gesturing with our hands as we talk 
819.21,without knowing it or doing it unconsciously. 
822.48,"And if we were talking on a telephone, "
825.06,I would have one hand here 
826.11,and I'd be gesturing with the other hand. 
827.897,[Andrew laughs] 
828.73,"Without even you seeing me, right? "
830.43,And so why is that? 
832.5,"Some have argued and I would agree, "
834.21,but based upon what we've seen 
836.16,is that there's an evolutionary relationship 
838.74,between the brain pathways 
840.03,that control speech production and gesturing. 
844.29,And the brain regions I mentioned 
845.94,are directly adjacent to each other. 
847.44,And why is that? 
848.49,I think that the brain pathways that control speech 
851.13,evolved out of the brain pathways that control body movement. 
855.39,All right. 
856.223,And that 
859.86,"when you talk about Italian, French, "
862.05,"English, and so forth, "
864.21,each one of those languages 
865.68,come with a learned set of gestures 
869.16,that you can communicate with. 
871.14,"Now, how is that related to other animals? "
873.18,"Well, Cocoa, a gorilla who is raised "
875.37,with humans for 
39,"years or more, "
879.12,"learned how to do gesture communication, "
882.3,"learned how to sign language, so to speak, right? "
885.6,But Cocoa couldn't produce those sounds. 
888.06,Cocoa could understand them as well 
891.595,by seeing somebody sign 
893.88,"or hearing somebody produce speech, "
896.19,but Cocoa couldn't produce it with her voice. 
898.74,"And so, what's going on there is that "
902.55,"a number of species, not all of them, "
904.26,a number of species have motor pathways in the brain 
907.14,"where you can do learn gesturing, "
909.45,"rudimentary language, if you wanted, say with your limbs, "
912.66,even if it's not as advanced as humans. 
914.79,But they don't have this extra brain pathway for the sound. 
918.75,So they can't gesture with their voice 
921.12,in the way that they gesture with their hands. 
923.52,- I see. 
924.54,One thing that I've wondered about for a very long time 
927.03,is whether or not 
929.64,primitive emotions and primitive sounds 
934.17,are the early substrate of language. 
937.23,And whether or not there's a bridge 
939.15,that we can draw between those 
940.89,in terms of just the basic respiration systems 
944.49,associated with different extreme feelings. 
947.43,Here's the way I'm imagining this might work. 
950.58,"When I smell something delicious, "
953.46,I typically inhale more. - Hmm hmm. 
957.0,"- And I might say, mmm, or something like that. "
960.27,"Whereas if I smell something putrid, "
962.04,"I typically turn away, and I wince "
964.23,"and I will exhale [exhales], "
966.12,"you know or sort of kind of like turn away, "
967.89,trying to not ingest those molecules 
970.05,or inhale those molecules. 
971.82,I could imagine that these 
973.68,are the basic dark and light contrasts 
977.07,of the language system. 
978.99,"And as I say that, "
979.823,I'm saying that from the orientation of a vision scientist 
983.1,who thinks of all visual images built up 
986.13,in a very basic way of a hierarchical map model 
989.19,of the ability to see dark and light. 
991.083,So I could imagine this kind of primitive 
993.39,to more sophisticated pyramid 
997.32,of sound to language. 
1000.41,Is this a crazy idea? 
1001.78,Do we have any evidence this is the way it works? 
1005.42,"- No, it's not a crazy idea. "
1007.07,"And in fact, "
1007.97,you hit upon one of the key distinctions 
1011.81,"in the field of research that I started out in, "
1014.45,which is vocal learning research. 
1016.49,"So for vocal communication, "
1020.3,"you have most vertebrate species vocalize, "
1023.63,but most of them are producing innate sounds 
1026.243,"that they're born with producing, "
1030.2,"that is babies crying, for example, "
1033.02,or dogs barking. 
1035.18,"And only a few species have learned vocal communication, "
1038.75,the ability to imitate sounds. 
1040.73,And that is what makes spoken language special. 
1043.43,"When people think of what's special about language, "
1046.67,it's the learned vocalizations. 
1049.28,That is what's rare. 
1051.14,"And so, this distinction between innateness and learned "
1056.03,is more of a bigger dichotomy 
1058.4,when it comes to vocalizations 
1059.6,than for other behaviors in the animal kingdom. 
1062.87,"And when you go in the brain, "
1065.48,you see it there as well. 
1067.805,"And so all the things you talked about, "
1069.5,"the breathing, the grunting and so forth, "
1071.87,"a lot of that is handled by the brain stem circuits, "
1075.17,"you know, right around the level of your neck and below. "
1078.92,Like a reflex kind of thing. 
1080.93,"So, or even some emotional aspects of your behavior "
1084.65,in the hypothalamus and so forth. 
1086.66,"But for a learned behavior, "
1088.73,"learning how to speak, "
1090.98,"learning how to play the piano, "
1092.78,teaching a dog to learn how to do tricks 
1095.54,is using the forebrain circuits. 
1098.09,And what has happened is 
1100.07,that there's a lot of forebrain circuits 
1101.81,"that are controlling, "
1102.643,"learning how to move body parts in these species, "
1104.54,but not for the vocalizations. 
1106.34,"But in humans and in parrots and in some other species, "
1109.76,"somehow, we acquired circuits "
1112.04,where the forebrain has taken over the brain stem 
1116.27,"and now using that brain stem, "
1118.22,"not only to produce the innate behaviors or vocal behaviors, "
1121.37,but the learned ones as well. 
1123.71,- Do we have any sense 
1124.76,of when modern or sophisticated language evolved? 
1130.04,"You know, thinking back to the species that we evolved from, "
1134.33,"and even within Homo sapiens, "
1138.11,has there been an evolution of language? 
1139.55,Has there been a devolution of language? [laughs] 
1142.16,- Yeah. 
1143.3,"Yeah, I would say, "
1146.21,"and to be able to answer that question, "
1148.94,it does come with the caveat 
1150.44,that I think we humans overrate ourselves 
1153.35,compared to other species. 
1155.06,And so it makes even scientists go astray 
1160.01,in trying to hypothesize 
1161.24,"when, you especially don't find fossil evidence "
1163.64,of language that easily 
1166.79,out there in terms of what happened in the past. 
1173.15,"Amongst the primates, which we humans belong to, "
1175.82,we are the only ones that 
1176.843,have this advanced vocal learning ability. 
1181.1,"Now, it was assumed that it was only Homo sapiens, "
1186.83,then you can go back in time now 
1188.99,"based upon genomic data, "
1191.03,"not only of us living humans, "
1192.5,but of the fossils that have been found 
1194.6,"for Homo sapiens, of Neanderthals, of Denisovan individuals "
1200.27,"and discover that our ancestor, our human ancestors, "
1205.55,supposedly hybridized with these other hominid species. 
1210.83,And it was assumed that these other hominid species 
1213.68,don't learn how to imitate sounds. 
1216.47,I don't know of any species today 
1218.45,that's a vocal learner that can have children 
1221.15,with a non-vocal learning species. 
1223.34,I don't see it. 
1224.18,Doesn't mean it didn't exist. 
1226.1,And when we look at the genetic data 
1228.92,"from these ancestral hominids, that, you know, "
1233.0,where we can look at genes that are involved 
1235.55,"in learned vocal communication, "
1237.53,they have the same sequence as we humans do 
1241.07,for genes that function in speech circuits. 
1243.8,So I think Neanderthals had spoken language. 
1246.38,I'm not going to say it's as advanced as what it is in humans. 
1248.99,I don't know. 
1250.28,But I think it's been there for at least 
1252.26,between 
"500,",
000,to a million years 
1255.41,that our ancestors had this ability 
1258.56,and that we've been coming more and more advanced with it 
1260.96,culturally and possibly genetically. 
1264.53,But I think it's evolved sometime 
1266.0,in the last 
"500,",
000,to a million years. 
1268.28,- Incredible. 
1270.71,Maybe we could talk a little bit more 
1271.91,about the overlap between brain circuits 
1274.46,that control language and speech 
1276.62,in humans and other animals. 
1280.25,I was weaned in the neuroscience era 
1283.25,where birdsong and the ability of birds 
1287.57,to learn their tooter song 
1289.639,"was and still is a prominent field, "
1292.61,subfield of neuroscience. 
1293.9,"And then of course, "
1294.733,"neuroimaging of humans speaking and learning, et cetera, "
1299.51,"and this notion of a critical period, "
1301.16,a time in which language is learned more easily 
1304.4,than it is later in life. 
1306.2,And the names of the different brain areas 
1308.81,were quite different. 
1310.49,"If one opens the textbooks, "
1312.14,we hear Wernicke's and Broca's for the humans. 
1314.63,"And you look at the birds of it, "
1315.92,"I remember, you know. "
1317.303,"- HVC. - Robustus, striatum. "
1319.97,Area X. - That's right. 
1320.87,"That's right, yes. - Et cetera. "
1322.79,"But for most of our listeners, "
1324.59,"those names won't mean a whole lot, "
1326.99,but in terms of homologies 
1330.89,"between areas in terms of function, what do we know? "
1333.62,And how similar or different are the brain areas 
1337.25,controlling speech and language 
1338.677,in say a songbird and a young human child? 
1342.41,"- Yeah, so, going back to the "
1950s,
1346.1,"or even a little earlier, "
1347.33,"and Peter Muller and others who got involved in neurotology, "
1351.47,the study of neurobiology of behavior 
1354.8,"in a natural way, right. "
1357.44,"You know, they start to find that behaviorally, "
1360.86,there are these species of birds 
1362.3,"like songbirds and parrots, "
1363.59,"and now we also know hummingbirds, just three of them "
1366.05,out of the 
40-something,"bird groups out there on the planet, "
1368.99,"orders, that they can imitate sounds like we do. "
1372.68,And so that was a similarity. 
1374.36,"In other words, they had this kind of behavior "
1376.22,that's more similar to us than chimpanzees have with us 
1379.28,"or than chickens have with them, right, "
1381.68,their closer relatives. 
1383.24,"And then they discovered even more similarities, "
1385.67,"these critical periods that if you remove a child, "
1390.17,"you know, this unfortunately happens where a child is feral "
1393.35,and is not raised with human 
1394.7,"and goes through their puberty phase of growth, "
1398.0,it becomes hard for them to learn a language as an adult. 
1401.24,So there's this critical period where you learn best. 
1404.06,"And even later on, when you're in regular society, "
1406.4,it's hard to learn. 
1407.54,"Well, the birds undergo these same thing. "
1410.45,"And then it was discovered that if they become deaf, "
1413.99,"we humans become deaf, "
1415.61,our speech starts to deteriorate 
1417.5,without any kind of therapy. 
1420.02,"If a non-human primate or, you know, "
1423.23,"or let's say a chicken becomes deaf, "
1426.53,their vocalizations don't deteriorate. 
1428.42,very little at least. 
1430.4,"Well, this happens in the vocal learning birds. "
1432.92,So there were all these behavioral parallels 
1434.81,"that came along with a package, "
1436.58,and then people looked into the brain. 
1438.95,"Fernando Nottebohm, my former PhD advisor, "
1441.53,"and began to discover the Area X you talked about, "
1445.34,the robust nucleus of the archipallium. 
1449.9,And these brain pathways were not found 
1452.0,in the species who couldn't imitate 
1453.35,so there was a parallel here. 
1455.0,"And then jumping many years later, you know, "
1458.42,I started to dig down into these brain circuits 
1461.39,to discover that these brain circuits 
1463.79,"had parallel functions with the brain circuits for humans, "
1466.79,"even though they're by a different name, "
1468.23,like Broca's laryngeal motor cortex. 
1470.84,"And most recently, "
1472.31,we discovered not only the actual circuitry 
1474.647,"and the connectivity are similar, "
1476.51,but the underlying genes that are expressed 
1479.18,"in these brain regions in a specialized way, "
1481.85,"different from the rest of the brain, "
1483.05,"are also similar between humans, and songbirds and parrots. "
1486.83,So all the way down to the genes. 
1488.15,And now we're finding the specific mutations 
1491.3,"are also similar, not always identical, but similar, "
1494.9,which indicates remarkable convergence 
1497.06,for a so-called complex behavior 
1499.4,in species separated by 
300,million years 
1501.56,from a common ancestor. 
1502.91,"And not only that, "
1504.08,we are discovering that mutations in these genes 
1508.34,"that cause speech deficits in humans, like in FOXP"
"2,",
1513.351,if you put those same mutations 
1515.21,"or similar type of deficits in these vocal learning birds, "
1518.06,you get similar deficits. 
1519.74,So convergence of the behavior 
1521.9,is associated with similar genetic disorders 
1524.75,of the behavior. 
1525.62,- Incredible. 
1526.88,"I have to ask, do hummingbird sing, or do they hum? "
1531.02,- Hummingbirds hum with their wings 
1532.94,and sing with their syrinx. 
1534.7,- In a coordinated way? 
1536.11,- In a coordinated way. 
1537.56,"There's some species of hummingbirds that actually will, "
1543.11,"Doug Ashler showed this, "
1544.49,that will flap their wings 
1546.98,and create a slapping sound with their wings 
1549.98,that's in unison with their song 
1552.29,"and you would not know it, "
1554.21,"but it sounds like a particular syllable in their songs, "
1558.56,even though it's their wings 
1560.33,and their voice at the same time. 
1562.07,- Hummingbirds are clapping to their song? 
1564.47,"- Clapping with their, "
1565.52,they're snapping their wings together 
1568.22,"in unison with a song to make it like, "
1570.86,"if I'm going ba, da, da, da [bangs], but, da [bangs] "
1574.31,and I banged on the table 
1575.75,except they make it almost sound like their voice 
1578.09,with their wings. 
1580.16,- Incredible. - Yes. 
1581.3,"- I, I'm... "
1582.62,- And they got some of the smallest brains around. 
1583.453,"- As the kids would say mind blown, right? "
1585.74,- Yes. Yes. 
1586.573,- Incredible. - Yes. 
1587.51,"- Incredible, I love hummingbirds. "
1588.71,And I always feel like it's such a special thing 
1591.08,to get a moment to see one 
1592.13,because they move around so fast 
1593.39,and they fled away so fast in these ballistic trajectories. 
1596.66,- [Erich] Yep. 
1597.493,"- That when you get to see one stationary for a moment, "
1600.68,"or even just hovering there, "
1602.93,you feel like you're extracting so much 
1604.37,"from their little microcosm of life, "
1607.13,but now I realize they're playing music essentially. 
1609.68,"- Right, exactly. "
1610.513,And what's amazing about hummingbirds 
1613.01,"and I'm going to say, vocal learning species in general, "
1616.31,"is that for whatever reason, "
1618.2,they seem to evolve multiple complex traits. 
1621.92,"You know, this idea that the evolving language, "
1624.86,"spoken language in particular, "
1626.84,comes along with a set of specializations. 
1629.69,- Incredible. - Yeah. 
1631.28,"- When I was coming up in neuroscience, "
1633.62,I learned that I think it was the work of Peter Muller 
1637.55,"that young birds learn, "
1640.55,"songbirds learned their tooter song and learn it quite well, "
1646.31,but that they could learn the song of another tooter. 
1649.49,"In other words, they could learn a different, "
1651.17,"and for the listeners, I'm doing air quotes here, "
1652.767,"""a different language"", "
1653.817,"""a different bird song"", "
1655.61,different than their own species song. 
1657.59,But never as well as they could learn 
1659.66,their own natural genetically linked song. 
1664.43,"- Yes. - Genetically linked, "
1665.45,meaning that it would be like 
1667.13,"me being raised in a different culture, "
1668.84,"and that I would learn the other language, "
1672.92,but not as well as I would have learned English. 
1675.71,This is the idea. - Yes. 
1677.06,"- Is that true? - That is true, yes. "
1679.051,And that's what I learned growing up as well. 
1681.17,And talked to Peter Muller himself about before he passed. 
1685.79,"Yeah, he used to call it the innate predisposition to learn. "
1689.51,All right. 
1690.941,So which would be kind of the equivalent 
1693.86,in the linguistic community of universal grammar. 
1696.41,There is something genetically 
1699.71,influencing our vocal communication 
1703.01,on top of what we learned culturally. 
1705.5,And so there's this balance 
1707.24,between the genetic control of speech 
1709.76,or a song in these birds 
1711.41,and the learned cultural control. 
1714.5,"And so, yes, if you were to take, "
1718.22,"you know, I mean, in this case, "
1720.5,we actually tried this at Rockefeller later on. 
1722.96,"Take a zebra finch and raise it with a canary, "
1726.62,it would sing a song 
1728.27,that was sort of like a hybrid in between. 
1729.89,"We call it a can-inch, right? "
1731.665,[both laughing] 
1733.46,"And vice versa for the canary, "
1735.29,because there's something different 
1736.34,about their vocal musculature 
1737.99,or the circuitry in the brain. 
1740.57,"And with a zebra finch, even with a closely related species, "
1743.78,"if you would take a zebra finch, a young animal, "
1747.32,"and in one cage next to it placed its own species, "
1750.59,"adult male, right. "
1752.15,"And in the other cage placed a Bengalese finch next to it, "
1755.51,it would preferably learn the song 
1757.7,from its own species neighbor. 
1760.4,"But if you remove its neighbor, "
1762.17,it would learn that Bengalese finch very well. 
1764.9,- [Andrew] Fantastic. 
1766.4,- It has something to do with also the social bonding 
1769.04,with your own species. 
1770.36,- Incredible. 
1771.59,"That raises a question that I, "
1773.45,"based on something I also heard, "
1774.83,but I don't have any scientific 
1777.26,"peer-reviewed publication to point to, "
1778.97,"which is this idea of Pidgin not the bird, "
1781.49,but this idea of when multiple cultures 
1785.21,"and languages converge in a given geographic area, "
1787.67,that the children of all the different native languages 
1790.43,will come up with their own language. 
1793.22,"I think this was in island culture, "
1795.02,"maybe in Hawaii, called Pidgin, "
1796.82,which is sort of a hybrid of the various languages 
1799.58,that their parents speak at home 
1801.227,and that they themselves speak. 
1803.39,"And that somehow Pidgin again, not the bird, "
1806.6,"but a language called Pidgin, "
1808.01,"for reasons, I don't know, "
1810.41,harbors certain basic elements of all language. 
1814.64,Is that true? 
1815.81,Is that not true? 
1817.481,"- I would say, I haven't studied enough myself "
1819.41,"in terms of Pidgin, specifically, "
1821.51,but in terms of cultural evolution of language 
1824.15,"and hybridization between different cultures and so forth, "
1827.57,even amongst birds with different dialects 
1830.54,"and you bring them together, you know, "
1833.75,what is going on here is cultural evolution 
1837.95,remarkably tracks genetic evolution. 
1841.19,So if you bring people 
1843.26,from two separate populations together 
1845.09,"that have been in their separate populations, "
1847.37,"evolutionarily, at least for hundreds of generations, "
1851.36,"so someone's speaking Chinese, "
1852.74,"someone's speaking English, "
1854.57,and that child is then learning from both of them. 
1858.26,"Yes, that child's going to be able to pick up "
1860.69,and merge phonemes and words together 
1866.09,"in a way that an adult wouldn't, because, why? "
1869.21,They're experiencing both languages at the same time 
1872.93,"during their critical period years, "
1876.05,in a way that adults would not be able to experience. 
1879.77,And so you get a hybrid. 
1881.57,And the lowest common denominator 
1883.61,is going to be what they share. 
1885.38,And so the phonemes that they've re retained 
1887.84,"in each of their languages is what's going to be, "
1891.83,"I imagine, used the most. "
1893.6,- Interesting. 
1895.16,So we've got brain circuits in songbirds and in humans 
1900.11,"that in many ways are similar, "
1901.73,"perhaps not in their exact wiring, "
1903.77,but in their basic contour of wiring. 
1905.96,And genes that are expressed 
1907.43,in both sets of neural circuits in very distinct species 
1911.48,that are responsible for these phenomenon 
1914.63,we're calling speech and language. 
1916.85,What sorts of things are those genes controlling? 
1920.57,I could imagine they were controlling the wiring 
1923.39,of connections between brain areas. 
1924.98,"You know, essentially a map of, you know, of a circuit, "
1928.85,basically like an engineer 
1929.84,"would design a circuit for speech and language, "
1931.61,"nature designed the circuit for speech and language, "
1934.79,but presumably other things too. 
1936.77,Like the ability to connect motor patterns 
1942.44,"within the throat of muscles within the throat, "
1944.39,or in the control of the tongue. 
1946.01,"I mean, what are these genes doing? "
1947.75,"- You're pretty good, yeah. "
1949.04,You've made some very good guesses there that makes sense. 
1954.44,"So, yes, one of the things that differ "
1956.81,in the speech pathways of us 
1958.28,and these song pathways of birds 
1959.78,is some of the connections are fundamentally different 
1962.42,"than the surrounding circuits, "
1964.04,like a direct cortical connection 
1967.91,from the areas that control vocalizations in the cortex 
1970.28,"or the motor neurons that control the larynx, "
1972.56,in humans or the syrinx in birds. 
1974.9,And so we actually made a prediction 
1977.63,"that since some of these connections differ, "
1980.09,"we're going to find genes that control neural connectivity, "
1983.42,"and that specialize in that function, that differ. "
1985.85,And that's exactly what we found. 
1989.27,Genes that control what we call axon guidance 
1991.55,"and form neuronal connections, "
1992.87,"and what was interesting, "
1994.07,it was sort of in the opposite direction that we expected. 
1997.97,"That is, some of these genes, "
2000.58,"actually, a number of them "
2001.6,that control neural connectivity were turned off 
2004.87,"in the speech circuit, all right. "
2007.87,And it didn't make sense to us at first 
2009.4,until we started to realize the function 
2011.08,"of these genes are to repel connections from forming, "
2014.5,so repulsive molecules. 
2016.39,"And so when you turn them off, "
2018.58,they allow certain connections to form 
2020.26,that normally would have not formed. 
2022.24,"So by turning it off, "
2023.89,"you gain a function for speech, right? "
2027.58,Other genes that surprised us 
2029.68,"were genes involved in calcium buffering neuroprotection, "
2034.0,"like Parvalbumin or heat-shock proteins, "
2036.73,"so when your brain gets hot, these proteins turn on. "
2039.7,"And we couldn't figure out for a long time, "
2041.32,why is that the case? 
2043.0,"And then the idea popped to me one day and said, ah, "
2046.51,when I heard the larynx is the fastest firing muscles 
2049.9,"in the body, all right. "
2051.67,In order to vibrate sound 
2054.1,"and modulate sound in the way we do, "
2056.68,"you have to control, "
2058.24,"you have to move those muscles, you know, "
2060.88,three to four to five times faster 
2063.1,than just regular walking or running. 
2065.47,And so when you stick electrodes 
2068.59,in the brain areas that control learned vocalizations 
2071.65,"in these birds and I think in humans as well, "
2074.35,those neurons are firing at a higher rate 
2076.93,to control these muscles. 
2078.79,And so what is that going to do? 
2080.95,"You're going to have lots of toxicity in those neurons, "
2083.59,unless you upregulate molecules 
2085.45,that take out the extra load 
2088.743,that is needed to control the larynx. 
2090.97,"And then finally, a third set of genes "
2092.86,that are specialized in these speech circuit 
2095.26,are involved in neuroplasticity. 
2097.9,"Neuroplasticity, meaning allowing the brain circuits "
2101.59,to be more flexible so you can learn better. 
2105.67,And why is that? 
2106.823,I think learning how to produce speech 
2109.27,is a more complex learning ability 
2112.6,than say learning how to walk 
2114.58,or learning how to do tricks 
2117.34,and jumps and so forth that dogs do. 
2119.71,"- Yeah, it's interesting as you say that, "
2121.803,because I realize that many aspects of speech 
2124.63,are sort of reflexive. 
2125.71,"I'm not thinking about each word I'm going to say, "
2127.78,"they just sort of roll out of my mouth, "
2129.07,hopefully with some forethought. 
2131.02,"We both know people that seem to speak, think less, "
2135.25,fewer synapses between their brain and their mouth 
2137.35,"than others, right. - Yes. "
2138.34,"- A lot of examples out there, "
2139.75,"and some people are very deliberate in their speech, "
2141.58,"but nonetheless, that much of speech has to be precise. "
2146.41,And some of it less precise. 
2149.02,In terms of plasticity of speech 
2151.33,"and the ability to learn multiple languages, "
2153.7,"but even just one language, "
2155.68,"what's going on in the critical period, "
2157.87,the so-called critical period? - Yeah. 
2159.19,"- Why is it that, so my niece speaks Spanish. "
2162.97,She's Guatemalan and speaks Spanish 
2164.44,and English incredibly well. 
2166.24,She's 
14-years-old.,
2168.19,I've struggled with Spanish my whole life. 
2169.63,My father is bilingual. 
2170.59,My mother is not. 
2171.7,I've tried to learn Spanish as an adult. 
2173.98,It's really challenging. 
2175.93,"I'm told that had I learned it when I was eight, "
2178.09,I would be better off. - That's right. 
2179.92,- Or it would be installed within me. 
2182.68,"So the first question is, "
2184.51,is it easier to learn multiple languages 
2186.37,without an accent early in life? 
2188.08,"And if so, why? "
2189.25,And then the second question is 
2190.78,if one can already speak more than one language 
2194.56,"as a consequence of childhood learning, "
2196.4,is it easier to acquire new languages later on? 
2200.32,"- So, the answer to both of those questions is yes, in that, "
2204.85,"but to explain this, I need to let you know, "
2209.02,actually the entire brain 
2211.39,"is undergoing a critical period development, "
2214.36,not just the speech pathways. 
2216.34,And so it's easier to learn how to play a piano. 
2219.28,It's easier to learn how to ride a bike 
2221.38,for the first time and so forth 
2223.24,as a young child than it is later in life. 
2227.2,What I mean easier in terms of when you start 
2231.55,from first principles of learning something. 
2233.92,"So the very first time, "
2235.51,if you're going to learn Chinese as a child 
2237.07,versus the very first time you learn Chinese as an adult 
2240.07,or learning to play piano as a child versus an adult. 
2244.33,"But the speech pathways, "
2246.49,"or let's say speech behavior, "
2248.32,I think has a stronger critical period 
2251.95,change to it than other circuits. 
2254.29,"And why, what's going on there in general? "
2259.57,Why do you need a critical period 
2261.01,"to make you more stable, "
2263.98,"to make you more stubborn, so to speak? "
2267.16,"The reason I believe is that the brain is not for, "
2272.107,the brain can only hold so much information. 
2275.56,"And if you are undergoing rapid learning to learn, "
2281.02,"to acquire new knowledge, "
2282.67,"you also have to, you know, dumb stuff. "
2285.76,"Put in memory or information in the trash, "
2288.97,like in a computer. 
2290.17,You only have so many gigabases of memory. 
2293.02,"And so therefore, plus also for survival, "
2297.28,you don't want to keep forgetting things. 
2299.74,"And so the brain is designed, I believe, "
2303.85,to undergo this critical period 
2305.92,and solidify the circuits with what you learned as a child 
2309.157,and you use that for the rest of your life. 
2311.14,And we humans stay even more plastic in our brain functions 
2316.0,controlled by a gene called srGAP
2.,
2318.49,We have an extra copy of it 
2320.05,that leads our speech circuit and other brain regions 
2322.24,in a more immature state throughout life 
2324.55,compared to other animals. 
2326.08,So we're more immature. 
2327.73,We're still juvenile like compared to other animals. 
2329.77,- I knew it. 
2330.666,- But we still go through the critical periods 
2332.86,like they all do. 
2334.24,"And now the question you asked about, "
2337.12,"if you learn more languages as a child, "
2341.71,is it easier to learn as an adult? 
2343.6,And that's a common finding out there in the literature. 
2346.39,There's some that argue against it. 
2348.13,"But for those that support it, the idea there is, "
2351.97,you are born with a set of innate sounds 
2354.64,you can produce of phonemes. 
2356.74,And you narrow that down 
2358.0,because not all languages use all of them. 
2360.37,And so you narrow down the ones 
2361.96,"you use to string the phonemes together, "
2364.33,in words that you learn 
2366.13,and you maintain those phonemes as an adult. 
2369.46,And here comes along another language 
2371.65,that's using those phonemes 
2372.85,or in different combinations you're not used to. 
2376.24,"And therefore, it's like starting from first principles, "
2379.48,but if you already have them 
2381.07,"in multiple languages that you're using, "
2383.23,then it makes it easier to use them 
2385.06,in another third or fourth language. 
2387.289,"- I see, incredible. "
2389.98,"- So, it's not like your brain "
2392.216,"has maintained greater plasticity, "
2394.57,it's your brain has maintained greater ability 
2397.45,to produce different sounds 
2399.52,that then allows you to learn another language faster. 
2402.16,- Got it. 
2403.6,Are the hand gestures associated with sounds 
2408.01,or with meanings of words? 
2410.17,- I think the hand gestures are associated 
2411.94,with both the sounds and the meaning. 
2414.49,"When I say sound like if you are really angry, right, "
2419.32,"and you are making a loud screaming noise, right, "
2422.86,you may make hand gestures 
2425.14,"that look like you're going to beat the wall, right? "
2427.9,"Because you're making loud sounds and loud gestures, right. "
2432.67,"But if you want to explain something like, come over here, "
2435.88,"what I just do now to you for those who can't see me, "
2438.64,I swung my hand towards you and swung it here to me. 
2441.88,"That has a meaning to it, to come here. "
2444.46,"So just like with the voice, "
2446.8,"the hand gestures are producing both, you know, "
2451.48,both qualities of sound. 
2453.13,"- And for people that speak multiple languages, "
2455.89,especially those that learn those multiple languages 
2458.41,"early in development, "
2459.76,do they switch their patterns of motor movements 
2462.28,"according to let's say, "
2464.14,going from Italian to Arabic 
2466.63,or from Arabic to French 
2468.79,in a way that matches the precision of language 
2472.9,that they're speaking? 
2473.98,- You know what? 
2474.813,"You just asked me a question, "
2475.646,I don't know the answer to. 
2477.13,I would imagine that would make sense because of switching 
2483.19,"in terms of sometimes people might call this code switching, "
2485.92,even different dialects of the same language. 
2488.41,Could you do that with your gestures? 
2490.57,"I imagine so, but I really don't know if that's true or not. "
2494.296,"- Okay, well, I certainly don't know from my own experience "
2495.91,because I only speak one language. 
2497.343,[both laughing] 
2499.63,"Before we continue with today's discussion, "
2501.88,"I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor, "
2503.95,"Athletic Greens, now called AG"
1.,
2507.19,"Athletic Greens, aka AGI, "
2509.44,is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink 
2511.9,that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes. 
2514.96,I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 
2012,
2517.66,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
2520.09,The reason I started taking Athletic Greens 
2521.467,and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day 
2524.65,is that it supplies 
2525.88,total foundational coverage of my vitamin mineral needs 
2528.97,and it supplies important nutrients that I need 
2531.88,to support my gut microbiome. 
2533.47,"The gut microbiome, as many of you know, "
2535.18,supports the immune system 
2536.29,"and it also supports the so-called gut brain access, "
2538.33,"which is vital for mood, for energy levels, "
2540.7,for regulating focus 
2541.96,and many other features of our mental health 
2543.79,and physical health that impact our daily performance 
2546.1,and high performance in any endeavors 
2547.75,we might be involved in. 
2549.13,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
2550.54,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
2553.18,and claim a special offer. 
2554.8,"They're giving away five free travel packs, "
2556.45,plus a year's supply of vitamin D
3,K
2,with every order. 
2560.35,"And of course, vitamin D"
3,K
2,
2562.06,are vital for all sorts of things like hormone health 
2564.64,and metabolic health 
2565.48,and K
2,for cardiovascular health and calcium regulation. 
2568.24,"Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman "
2571.45,to claim that special offer. 
2572.86,"To go a little bit into the abstract, but not too far, "
2577.54,what about modes of speech and language 
2579.43,"that seem to have a depth of emotionality and meaning, "
2583.03,but for which it departs from structured language. 
2586.99,"Here's what I mean, poetry. - Hmm hmm. "
2589.99,"- I think of musicians, "
2591.4,"like there's some Bob Dylan songs that, to me, "
2594.46,I understand the individual words. 
2597.19,I like to think there's an emotion associated with it. 
2600.25,"at least, I experience some sort of emotion "
2601.96,and I have a guess about what he was experiencing. 
2605.65,But if I were to just read it linearly without the music 
2609.49,"and without him singing it, or somebody singing it like him, "
2612.79,it wouldn't hold any meaning. 
2613.84,"So in other words, words that seem to have meaning, "
2617.2,"but not associated with language, "
2619.66,but somehow tap into an emotionality. 
2623.11,"- Yep, absolutely. "
2625.145,"So, we call this difference semantic communication, "
2629.2,communication with meaning 
2631.15,"and effective communication, "
2632.59,communication that has more 
2634.75,"of an emotional feeling content to it, "
2637.367,"you know, but not with, you know, the semantics. "
2640.3,"And the two can be mixed up, "
2642.58,"like with singing words that have meaning, "
2645.7,"but also have this effect of emotional, "
2647.95,you just love the sound of the singer that you're hearing. 
2652.03,"And initially, you know, "
2656.74,"psychologists, scientists, in general, "
2658.78,thought that these were going to be controlled 
2660.58,by different brain circuits. 
2663.04,And it is the case. 
2664.33,"There are emotional brain centers in the hypothalamus, "
2667.12,"in the cingulate cortex and so forth, "
2669.7,that do give tone to the sounds. 
2673.06,"But I believe, you know, based upon imaging work "
2677.14,"and work we see in birds, "
2679.57,when birds are communicating semantic information 
2682.72,"in their sounds, which is not too often, but it happens, "
2685.63,"versus effective communication, "
2688.51,"sing because I'm trying to attract the mate, "
2690.55,"my courtship song or defend my territory, "
2693.37,it's the same brain circuits. 
2694.69,"It's the same speech-like or song, "
2696.58,circuits are being used in different ways. 
2700.945,"- A friend of mine, who's also a therapist, said to me, "
2703.99,"you know, it's possible to say, "
2705.22,I love you with intense hatred 
2707.92,"than to say, I hate you with intense love. "
2710.2,- [Eric] Right. 
2711.033,- And reminding me that it's possible to hear 
2712.54,both of those statements in either way. 
2715.06,So I guess it's not just limited to song or poetry. 
2719.29,"It also, there's something about the intention "
2723.7,and the emotional context in which something spoken 
2727.24,that it can heavily shape the way 
2729.07,that we interpret what we hear. 
2731.26,- That's right. 
2732.31,"And I consider all of that actually, meaning, "
2735.43,"even though I defined it as, "
2737.71,people commonly do semantic and effective communication. 
2741.73,"Effective communication to say, I hate you, "
2743.98,"but meant love, right, "
2747.49,"does have emotional meaning to it, you know? "
2751.33,"And so, you know, one's more like an object kind of meaning "
2753.76,or an abstract kind of meaning. 
2755.71,There's several other points here 
2756.79,I think it's important for those listening out there to hear 
2760.45,is that when I say also 
2762.34,this effective and semantic communication 
2767.32,"being used by similar brain circuits, "
2768.85,"it also matters, the side of the brain. "
2771.31,"In birds and in humans, "
2774.49,there's left-right dominance 
2777.34,"for learned communication, learned sound communication. "
2781.51,"So the left in us humans is more dominant for speech, "
2785.71,but the right has a more balance for singing 
2789.25,or processing musical sounds 
2791.17,as opposed to processing speech. 
2792.85,Both get used for both reasons. 
2794.86,And so when people say your right brain 
2797.59,is your artistic brain 
2799.12,"and your left brain is your thinking brain, "
2801.43,this is what they're referring to. 
2803.71,And so that's another distinction. 
2806.26,A second thing that's useful to know 
2809.61,is that all vocal learning species 
2811.72,use their learned sounds for this emotional 
2815.38,"effective kind of communication, "
2818.05,but only a few of them like humans 
2820.39,and some parrots and dolphins 
2822.19,"use it for the semantic kind of communication, "
2825.07,we're calling speech. 
2827.23,And that has led a number of people to hypothesize 
2831.28,"that the evolution of spoken language, of speech, "
2834.43,"evolved first for singing, "
2837.19,for this more like emotional 
2839.71,"kind of mate attraction like the Jennifer Lopez, "
2842.56,the Ricky Martin kind of songs and so forth. 
2845.74,"And then later on, "
2847.45,it became used for abstract communication 
2849.61,like we're doing now. 
2851.05,"- Oh, interesting. "
2852.19,"Well, that's a perfect segue for me "
2854.68,to be able to ask you about your background 
2858.4,"and motor control, not only of the hands but of the body. "
2862.72,"So you have a number of important distinctions to your name, "
2866.35,but one of them is that you were a member 
2869.11,"of the Alvin Ailey Dance School, "
2872.11,School of Dance. - That's right. 
2872.98,"That's right, hmm hmm. "
2874.03,- So you're an accomplished 
2875.68,"and quite able dancer, right? "
2878.17,Tell us a little bit about your background 
2880.84,in the world of dance 
2883.12,"and how it informs your interest in neuroscience, "
2887.389,"[clears throat], excuse me, "
2888.222,and perhaps even how it relates 
2889.96,specifically to your work on speech and language. 
2892.09,"- Yes, well, it's interesting. "
2894.49,And then this kind of history even goes before my time. 
2897.31,"So in my family, my mother and father's side, "
2899.92,they both went to the High School of Music and Art 
2901.75,here in New York City. 
2903.58,"And particularly, in my mother's family, "
2905.23,"going back multiple generations, they were singers. "
2908.41,And I even did my family genealogy 
2910.33,"and found out not only, you know, "
2912.61,"we have some relationships to some well-known singers, "
2915.46,"distant relationships like Thelonious Monk, "
2917.8,but going back to the plantations 
2920.41,"in North Carolina and so forth, "
2922.93,my ancestors were singers in the church 
2925.81,"for the, you know, the towns and so forth. "
2927.97,And this somehow got passed on 
2929.8,multiple generations to my family. 
2931.93,And I thought I was going to grow up 
2933.7,"and be a famous singer, right. "
2935.26,And me and my brothers and sister 
2937.99,formed a band when we were kids and so forth. 
2941.68,But it turned out that I didn't inherit 
2944.62,"the singing talents of some of my other family members, "
2947.62,"even though, you know, I was, you know, okay. "
2950.2,"You know, but not like my brother, "
2951.97,"or not like my mother or my aunts and my cousin Pura Fe', "
2956.17,who's now a talented Native American singer. 
2958.99,"And so, "
2963.88,that then influenced me to do other things. 
2967.3,"And I started, you know, competing in dance contests, "
2972.04,"you know, actually this is around the time "
2973.45,of Saturday Night Fever and I was as a teenager. 
2976.15,And I started winning dance contests. 
2978.4,"And I thought, oh, I can dance. "
2980.11,And I auditioned for the High School of Performing Arts. 
2982.87,"And I got in, here in New York City, "
2985.39,"and got into ballet dance and got in, right. "
2988.15,"And thought, if I learned ballet, "
2989.83,I can learn everything else. 
2990.88,"It I that idea, if you learn something classical, "
2993.01,it can teach for everything else. 
2995.65,"And I was, yeah, at Alvin Ailey Dance School, "
2998.32,Joffrey Ballet Dance School. 
3000.06,"And at the end of my senior concert, "
3004.29,I had this opportunity to audition 
3006.3,for the Alvin Ailey Dance Company. 
3008.37,And I had an opportunity to go to college. 
3011.07,And I also fell in love with another passion 
3013.26,"that my father had, which was science. "
3015.84,And so I liked science in high school. 
3018.51,"And I found an overlap also between the arts and sciences, "
3022.65,"you know, both required creativity, hard work, discipline, "
3026.49,"you know, new discovery, both weren't boring to me. "
3029.7,And the one decision I made at that senior dance concert 
3033.81,"was, you know, when talking to the Alvin Ailey recruiter "
3036.78,"and thinking about it, "
3037.613,I have to make a decision. 
3039.36,And I thought something my mother taught me 
3042.72,because she was growing up in the 
1960s,"cultural revolution, "
3045.967,"""Do something that has a positive impact on society."" "
3049.92,And I thought that I could do that better 
3051.3,as a dancer than a scientist. 
3053.37,"So now jump, I get into college, undergraduate school, "
3057.81,I major in molecular biology and mathematics. 
3060.12,"I decide I want to be a biologist, "
3062.07,"got into graduate school, "
3063.15,"wanted to study the brain at, you know, "
3064.817,at the Rockefeller University. 
3066.42,So I went from Hunter College to Rockefeller University. 
3069.027,And so now I got to the brain 
3071.429,and why did I choose the brain 
3074.13,is because it controls dancing. [laughs] 
3077.58,But there wasn't anybody studying dancing. 
3079.92,"And I wanted study the brain, "
3081.27,something that it does 
3082.53,that's really interesting and complex. 
3084.99,"And I thought, ah, language is what it does. "
3087.48,You couldn't study that in mice. 
3088.65,You couldn't study in non-human primates. 
3090.69,But these birds do this wonderful thing 
3092.43,that Fernando Nottebohm was studying at Rockefeller. 
3094.89,And so that's what got me into the birds. 
3100.459,"And then jumping now, "
15,"years later, "
3103.29,"you know, yeah, that's right. "
3104.88,"Even after I'm into now having my own lab, "
3108.09,studying vocal learning in these birds 
3110.46,"as a model for language and humans, "
3112.44,"it turns out that, you know, "
3115.05,"Ani Patel and, you know, others, "
3118.11,have discovered that only vocal learning species 
3122.49,can learn how to dance. 
3124.716,"- Is that right? - That's right, yes. "
3127.41,- So I've seen these just scrolling 
3129.57,through the files here in my mind. 
3132.15,"I think about, every once in a while someone will, "
3133.92,I love parrots. - Yes. 
3136.11,"- So every once in a while, "
3136.943,someone will send me one of these little Instagram 
3139.2,or Twitter videos of a parrot 
3140.76,"doing what looks to me like dance, "
3142.47,typically it's a cockatoo. - That's right. 
3144.09,- Right. - That's right. 
3144.923,- Even foot stomping to the sound and- 
3147.0,"- Famous one called Snowball out there, "
3148.53,but there are many Snowballs out there. [laughs] 
3151.647,- All the dancing birds are named Snowball? 
3153.63,That's an interesting tactic. 
3156.0,So only animals with language dance? 
3160.02,"- Yeah, vocal learning in particular, "
3161.7,"the ability to imitate sounds, yes. "
3164.55,- Incredible. - Yes. 
3165.627,"And this now is bringing my life full circle, right. "
3170.55,And so when that was discovered in 
"2009,",
3175.17,"at that same time in my lab at Duke, "
3177.87,we had discovered that vocal learning brain pathways 
3182.1,"in songbirds, as well as in humans "
3184.56,"and in parrots, right, like Snowball, "
3188.01,are embedded within circuits 
3189.51,that control learning how to move. 
3192.54,And that led us to a theory called the Brain Pathway 
3195.66,or Motor Theory of Vocal Learning Origin 
3198.27,where the brain pathways for vocal learning and speech 
3201.33,evolved by a whole duplication 
3203.46,of the surrounding motor circuits 
3204.93,involving learning how to move. 
3207.63,"Now, how does that explain dance, right? "
3210.75,"Well, when Snowball, the cockatoos, are dancing, "
3215.25,they're using the brain regions 
3216.69,around their speech-like circuits 
3218.88,to do this dancing behavior. 
3220.8,And so what's going on there? 
3222.36,What we hypothesize and now like to test 
3226.5,"is that when this, "
3229.23,when speech evolved in humans 
3231.96,"and the equivalent behavior and parrots and songbirds, "
3235.23,it required a very tight integration 
3238.98,in the brain regions that can hear sound 
3241.89,with the brain regions that control your muscles 
3244.47,from moving your larynx and tongue and so forth 
3247.26,for producing sound. 
3249.359,"And that tight auditory motor integration, "
3251.88,"we argue, then contaminated the surrounding brain regions. "
3255.957,And that contamination of the surrounding brain regions 
3258.78,"now allows us humans, in particular, and parrots. "
3262.74,to coordinate our muscle movements of the rest of the body 
3266.31,with sound in the same way we do for speech sounds. 
3270.69,- [Andrew] Well. 
3271.523,- So we're speaking with our bodies when we dance. 
3273.54,- Incredible. 
3274.497,And I have to say that 
3276.15,"as poor as I am at speaking multiple languages, "
3278.76,"I'm even worse at dancing, so. "
3281.31,- But I guarantee you're better than a monkey. 
3284.19,"- But not Snowball, the cockatoo? "
3285.6,"- No, maybe not Snowball. "
3287.55,"On YouTube, we have a video "
3288.87,where there's some scientists dancing with Snowball 
3291.21,and you'll see Snowballs doing better 
3292.95,than some of the scientists. 
3294.279,"- Okay, well, as long as I'm not the worst "
3295.53,of all scientists dancing. - I don't think so. 
3298.71,- There's always a neuroplasticity. 
3300.51,May it save me someday. 
3303.3,You said something incredible 
3304.98,"that I completely believe even though I have minimum to, "
3310.65,let's just say minimum dancing ability. 
3312.72,"Okay, I can get by at a party or wedding "
3314.64,"without complete embarrassment, "
3316.29,but I don't have any structured training. 
3320.04,So the body clearly can communicate with movement. 
3326.88,"As a trained dancer and knowing other trained dancers, "
3330.979,I always think of dance and bodily movement 
3334.83,and communication through bodily movement 
3336.6,"as a form of wordlessness, "
3338.64,like a state of wordlessness. 
3340.23,"In fact, the few times when I think "
3342.0,that maybe I'm actually dancing modestly well 
3345.84,"for the context that I'm in, "
3347.52,or I see other people dancing 
3348.96,"and they seem to just be very much in the movement, "
3351.42,"it's almost like a state of non-language, "
3354.42,non-spoken language. - Hmm hmm. 
3357.591,- And yet what you're telling me is 
3359.79,that there's a direct bridge at some level 
3362.7,between the movement of the body and language. 
3365.67,So is there a language of the body 
3368.55,that is distinct from the language of speech? 
3372.03,"And if so, or if not, how do those map onto one another? "
3375.81,What does that Venn diagram look like? 
3377.46,"- Yeah, yeah. "
3379.68,"So, let me define first dance in this context "
3382.38,of vocal learning species. 
3384.6,This is the kind of dancing 
3386.13,that we are specialized in doing 
3388.41,and the vocal learning species are specialized in doing 
3391.38,is synchronizing body movements of muscles 
3394.56,to the rhythmic beats of music. 
3397.05,"And for some reason, we like doing that. "
3399.57,We like synchronizing to sound 
3402.719,and doing it together as a group of people. 
3405.39,And that kind of communication amongst ourselves 
3409.11,is more like the effective kind of communication 
3411.81,"I mentioned earlier, "
3413.04,unlike the semantic kind. 
3414.9,"So we, humans, are using our voices more "
3418.5,"for the semantic, abstract communication, "
3422.46,but we're using learned dance 
3424.47,for the effective emotional bonding kind of communication. 
3429.21,It doesn't mean we can't communicate semantic information 
3432.24,"in dance, and we do it, "
3434.49,but it's not as popular. 
3436.44,"You know, like a ballet that, you know, in the Nutcracker, "
3439.77,"it is popular, you know, "
3441.18,"where they are communicating, "
3443.01,"you know, the Arabian guy comes out, "
3445.98,which I was the Arabian guy in the ballet Nutcracker. 
3448.2,"That's how I remember. - Oh, yeah? "
3449.033,"- Yeah, for the Westchester Ballet Company, "
3450.78,when I was a teenager. 
3453.33,"You know, we're trying to communicate meaning "
3455.7,"and our ballet dancing, it can go on "
3457.35,with a whole story and so forth. 
3459.63,But people don't interpret that as clearly as speech. 
3462.72,"You know, they're seeing the ballet "
3464.61,"with semantic communication, "
3466.2,"with a lot of emotional content, "
3468.57,"whereas you go out to a club, you know, "
3471.0,"yeah, you're not communicating, "
3473.91,"okay, how you're feeling today? "
3475.17,Tell me about your day and so forth. 
3477.33,You're trying to synchronize with other people 
3479.97,in an effective way. 
3481.35,"And I think that's because, "
3484.44,the dance brain circuit 
3486.96,"inherited the more ancient part of the speech circuit, "
3490.08,which was for singing. 
3492.15,- I always had the feeling 
3493.23,"that with certain forms of music, in particular opera, "
3497.16,but any kind of music where there's some long notes sung 
3503.34,"that at some level, "
3505.83,there was a literal resonance created 
3509.22,between the singer and the listener. 
3513.153,Or I think of like the deep voice of a Johnny Cash 
3515.97,"or where at some level, "
3517.41,you can almost feel the voice in your own body. 
3520.38,"And in theory, that could be the vibration of the "
3525.57,or the firing of the phrenic nerve 
3526.95,controlling the diaphragm for all I know. 
3529.04,Is there any evidence that there's a coordination 
3531.12,between performer and audience 
3533.693,at the level of mind and body? 
3540.72,"- I'm going to say, possibly, yes. "
3544.11,And the reason why is 
3545.22,because I just came back from a conference 
3547.35,on the neurobiology of dance- 
3550.47,"- Clearly, I'm going to the wrong meetings. "
3552.153,"- Yeah, a colleague invited me. "
3553.506,"- You know, vision science sounds be so boring. "
3554.76,"- Yes, well, one of my colleagues, "
3556.71,"Tecumseh Fitch and Jonathan Fritz, "
3558.84,"they organized, well, a particular section "
3561.6,on this conference in Virginia. 
3563.79,And this is the first time I was in the room 
3565.89,with so many neuroscientists 
3568.17,studying the neurobiology of dance. 
3569.76,"It's a new field now, in the last five years. "
3572.58,And there was one lab 
3576.9,"where they were putting EEG electrodes on the dancers, "
3581.61,"on two different dancers partnering with each other, "
3584.49,"as well as the audience, you know, seeing the dance "
3589.38,"and some, you know, argued, "
3590.91,"okay, if you're listening to the music as well, "
3592.283,how are you responding 
3593.58,'cause you're asking a question about music 
3595.68,and I'm giving you an answer about dance. 
3598.08,"And what they found is that, you know, the dancers, "
3602.31,"when they resonated with each other during the dance, "
3604.65,"or the audience listening to the dancers and the music, "
3607.8,there's some resonance going on there 
3609.69,that they've score as higher resonance. 
3613.11,Their brain activity with these wireless EEG signals 
3616.47,are showing something different. 
3618.09,"And so that's why I say possibly, yes. "
3620.7,It needs more rigorous study 
3623.22,"and you know, this is some stuff they publish, "
3625.71,"but it's not prime time yet, "
3627.54,but they're trying to figure this out. 
3629.4,- Love it. 
3630.233,"So at least if I can't dance well, "
3632.31,maybe I can hear and feel 
3634.44,what it is to dance in a certain way. 
3636.213,"- Yes, that's right. "
3637.65,"And this will be, some people will think that they, "
3641.61,even songs that they hear 
3643.77,and they can almost sing to themselves in their own head 
3646.89,and they know what they want it to sound like. 
3649.163,"And you know when it really sounds good, "
3651.27,"what it sounds like, "
3652.59,but they can't get their voice to do it. 
3655.5,"- I'm raising, for those listening, "
3656.76,I'm raising my hand. 
3658.29,No musical ability. 
3660.12,Others in my household have tremendous musical ability 
3663.3,"with instruments and with voice, but not me. "
3666.21,"- Yeah, well, and so this is one of my selfish goals "
3671.79,of trying to find the genetics 
3673.77,of why can some people who sing really well and some not. 
3677.76,Is there some genetic predisposition to that? 
3680.547,And then can I modify my own muscles 
3682.89,of brain circuits to sing better? 
3684.45,- You're still after the sing. 
3686.244,I guess this is what happens 
3687.077,when siblings vary in proficiency 
3690.75,is that competitiveness amongst brothers 
3693.51,and sisters never goes away. 
3694.83,"- I've been trying to be as good as my brother, "
3696.78,"Mark and Victor, you know, for my entire life. "
3700.35,"- Well, watch out, Mark and Victor, "
3701.43,he's coming for you with neuroscience to back him. 
3705.03,"Earlier, you said that you discovered that you could dance. "
3709.41,That caught my ear. 
3711.36,"It sounds like you didn't actually have to, "
3712.98,I'm not suggesting you didn't work hard at it. 
3715.047,"But at the moment where you discovered it, "
3717.6,"it just sort of was a skill that you had, "
3720.27,"that up until that point, "
3721.92,"you didn't target a life in the world of dance, "
3726.15,"but the fact that you quote, unquote, "
3728.077,"""discovered that you could dance really well"" "
3730.17,and then went to this incredible school of dance 
3731.94,"and did well, "
3733.53,tells me that perhaps there is an ability 
3736.41,that was built up in childhood 
3738.78,and or that perhaps we do all have 
3741.57,different genetic leanings for different motor functions. 
3744.9,"- Yeah, well, for me, there could be, "
3747.6,both explanations could be possible. 
3749.34,"For the first, yeah, I grew up in a family, "
3752.28,"listening to Motown songs, "
3754.29,"you know, dancing, you know, at parties and so forth, "
3757.8,"family parties and, you know, "
3759.36,"an African American family, basically. "
3761.55,"And so I grew up dancing from a young child, "
3768.42,"but this discovery, you know, maybe dancing even moreso, "
3774.57,"in terms of a talent, "
3777.03,"it could, the genetic component, "
3778.71,"if it really exists, I don't know. "
3780.21,"You know, with my "
23andMe,"results, you know, "
3783.75,it says I have the genetic substitutions 
3787.83,"that are associated with, you know, "
3790.2,high intensity athletes and fast twitch muscles. 
3793.17,And who knows. 
3794.16,Maybe that could have something to do with 
3796.14,me being able to synchronize my body 
3800.7,"to rhythmic sounds, maybe, "
3803.91,"maybe, better than some others. "
3806.43,It turns out that my genetics also show 
3808.92,that I have a genetic substitute 
3811.35,that makes it hard for me to sing on pitch. 
3814.68,"And so that does correlate with my, you know, "
3817.08,"even though I can sing on this pitch, "
3818.28,"especially if I hear a piano or, you know, "
3820.89,"kind of playing it, but, "
3822.51,"you know, maybe that's why my siblings, you know, "
3824.64,who didn't have that genetic predisposition 
3827.01,in his 
23andMe,"results, you know, "
3829.44,"it could go along with the genetic component, as well. "
3832.62,- I'm imagining family gatherings with 
23andMe,data 
3836.16,"and intense arguments about it, "
3838.29,innate and learned ability. - Yes. 
3839.94,- Fun. 
3841.17,Love to be an attendant. 
3842.85,I'm not inviting myself to your Thanksgiving dinner 
3844.89,"by the way, but I suppose I am. "
3847.17,- You're welcome to. - Thank you. 
3849.27,I'll bring my 
23andMe,data. 
3851.52,I'd love to chat a moment about facial expression 
3854.67,"because that's a form of motor pattern that, "
3857.213,"you know, I think for most people out there "
3860.37,"just think about smiling and frowning, "
3862.35,"but there are, of course, you know, thousands, "
3864.48,if not millions of micro expressions 
3867.45,"and things of that sort, "
3868.65,many of which are subconscious. 
3870.99,And we are all familiar with the fact that 
3874.68,when what somebody says 
3876.27,doesn't match some specific feature 
3878.4,of their facial expression 
3880.35,"that it can call, you know, "
3882.51,"that mismatch can cue our attention, "
3885.21,especially among people that know each other very well. 
3887.91,"Like somebody will say, well, you said that, "
3890.43,"but your right eye twitched to the, you know, "
3893.58,a little bit in a way that tells me 
3895.35,"that you didn't really mean that, "
3896.49,these kinds of things. 
3897.69,"Or when, in the opposite example, "
3901.8,when the emotionality and the content of our speech 
3905.04,"is matched to a facial expression, "
3907.2,"there's something that's just so wonderful about that, "
3911.25,because it seems like everything's aligned. 
3912.99,- [Erich] Yeah. 
3913.823,- So how does the motor circuitry 
3916.29,that controls facial expression 
3918.0,"map onto the brain circuits that control language, "
3921.6,"speech, and even bodily and hand movements? "
3923.4,"- Yeah, and you ask a great question "
3926.1,because we both know some colleagues 
3928.02,like Winrich Freiwald at Rockefeller University 
3930.63,who study facial expression and the neurology behind it. 
3933.99,And now we both share some students that we're co-mentoring. 
3937.53,And talk about this same question that you brought up. 
3941.31,And what I'm learning a lot 
3943.17,is that non-human primates have a lot of diversity 
3946.59,in their facial expression like we humans do. 
3949.2,And what we know about the neurobiology 
3952.14,of brain regions controlling those muscles of the face 
3955.62,is that these non-human primates 
3957.15,and some other species that don't learn 
3958.83,"how to imitate vocalizations, "
3960.75,they have strong connections from the cortical regions 
3965.79,"to the motor neurons that control facial expressions, "
3969.36,but absent connections or weak connections 
3972.42,to the motor neurons that control the voice. 
3974.76,"So I think our diverse facial expression, "
3978.93,"even though it's more diverse in these non-human primates, "
3981.03,"there was already a preexisting diversity of communication, "
3985.68,whether it's intentional or unconscious 
3988.08,through facial expression in our ancestors. 
3991.5,"And on top of that, we humans now add the voice "
3995.76,along with those facial expressions. 
3998.1,- I see. 
3999.886,"And in terms of language learning when we're kids, "
4002.78,"I mean, children, fortunately are not told "
4005.21,to fake their expressions 
4006.38,or to smile when they say I'm happy. 
4009.38,"So at some point, everybody learns, for better or for worse, "
4012.95,"how to untangle these different components of hand movement, "
4018.53,"body posture, speech, and facial expression. "
4021.41,- [Erich] Yes. 
4022.243,"- But in their best form, I would say, "
4025.7,"assuming that the best form is always, "
4027.47,"I guess there are instances where, you know, "
4029.03,"for safety reasons, one might need "
4030.65,to fain some of these aspects of language. 
4033.92,"But in most cases, when those are aligned, "
4036.74,it seems like that could reflect that 
4039.65,"all the different circuitries are operating in parallel, "
4042.32,but that the ability to misalign these 
4045.47,is also a powerful aspect to our maturation. 
4049.91,"I can think of theater, for instance, "
4051.83,where deliberate disentangling of these areas is important. 
4056.72,"But also we know when an actor, "
4059.39,when it feels real. - Yep. 
4061.34,"- And when it looks like, "
4062.69,when bad acting is oftentimes 
4064.52,when the facial expression or body posture 
4066.5,just doesn't quite match what we're hearing. 
4068.06,- [Erich] Yeah. 
4068.93,"- So are these skills that people, "
4072.17,that learn and acquire according 
4073.61,to adaptability and profession? 
4075.23,Or do you think that all children and all adults 
4078.59,eventually learn how to couple 
4080.0,and uncouple these circuits a little bit? 
4082.46,"- Yeah, I think it's this similar argument "
4085.25,I mentioned earlier about the innate and learned 
4088.37,for the vocalizations. 
4089.6,"And by the way, when I say, "
4090.95,we humans have facial expressions 
4092.72,associated with our vocalizations 
4094.64,"in a different way than primates, non-human primates, "
4097.04,it's the learned vocalizations I'm talking about. 
4099.59,So there is a common view out there 
4103.7,that facial expressions in non-human species 
4106.43,"like nonhuman primates, "
4108.14,"or you can have them in birds, too, "
4110.24,"are innate, all right. "
4113.48,And so they're reflexive and controlled. 
4116.24,I don't believe that. 
4117.073,I think there's some learned component to it. 
4118.85,"And I think we have more learning component to it as well, "
4121.88,but we also have an innate component. 
4124.88,And so if you try to put your hands behind your back 
4128.3,"and hold your fist, or even just not, "
4129.89,"and try to speak and try to communicate, "
4132.44,it's actually harder to do. 
4133.79,You have to force yourself or put it by your side. 
4137.15,This comes naturally. 
4138.41,Facial expressions comes naturally 
4139.88,because there's an innate component. 
4142.07,"And yes, you have to learn how to dissociate the two, "
4146.36,communicate something angry with your hands 
4148.37,"or with your face, "
4149.48,"but, you know, politely with your voice. "
4153.59,"It's very hard to separate those two, "
4156.32,because there is that innate component 
4158.33,that brings them together. 
4161.18,"So it's like an email, too. "
4162.41,"You're emailing and someone says something by email, "
4165.68,"someone can interpret that angrily or gently, "
4170.42,and it becomes ambiguous. 
4172.67,The facial expressions get rid of that ambiguity. 
4176.15,- So glad you brought that up 
4177.02,"because my next question was, "
4178.67,and is about written language. 
4181.31,"The first question I'll ask is when you write, "
4184.1,"either type or write things out by hand, "
4186.77,do you hear the content of what you want to write 
4191.87,in your head? 
4192.83,"Just, you personally. "
4194.6,"- Yes, I do. "
4195.74,"Yeah, and I know that I do, "
4199.58,because I was trying to figure out a debate about this issue 
4203.54,and trying to resolve the debate 
4206.03,with my own self experimentation on me. 
4209.06,"- I asked that because, "
4211.531,"a quite well-known colleague of ours, "
4212.72,"Karl Deisseroth at Stanford, "
4214.7,"who's been on this podcast, you know, "
4216.879,"his optogenetics fame and psychiatry fame, et cetera. "
4218.81,"- Yeah, I know him. - Yeah, he sends his regards. "
4221.757,- Okay. [laughs] 
4222.86,- Told me that his practice for writing 
4227.3,and for thinking involves a quite painful process 
4232.31,of forcing himself to sit completely still 
4236.18,"and think in complete sentences, "
4238.37,to force thinking in complete sentences. 
4240.047,"And when he told me that, "
4241.31,I decided to try this exercise and it's quite difficult. 
4243.95,"First of all, it's difficult "
4244.88,"for the reason that you mentioned, "
4246.59,"which is that with many thoughts, "
4248.36,I want to look around 
4249.193,"and I start to gesticulate with my hands, right? "
4252.14,"So there it is, again, "
4253.01,"the connection between language and hand movement, "
4255.68,even if one isn't speaking. 
4258.47,And the other part that's challenging is 
4261.86,"I realize that while we write in complete sentences, "
4265.16,"most of the time, we'll talk about how that's changing now. "
4268.057,"- Right. - In texting, et cetera. "
4270.14,"That we don't often think in complete sentences, "
4274.61,"and specifically in simple declarative sentences, "
4278.75,"that a lot of our thoughts would be, "
4280.73,if they were written out onto a page 
4283.34,would look pretty much like passive language 
4287.3,"that a good copy editor or a good editor would say, "
4290.36,"ugh, like we need to cross this out, "
4291.95,make this simple and declarative. 
4293.63,So what I'm getting at here is 
4295.88,"what is the process of going from a thought to language, "
4300.17,to written word? 
4302.18,"And I also wanted to touch on handwritten versus typed, "
4306.92,"but thought to language, to written word. "
4309.65,What's going on there? 
4310.7,What do we know about the neural circuitry? 
4313.07,"And I was going to ask, why is it so hard? "
4315.47,But now I want to ask why is this even possible? 
4318.74,It seems like a very challenging 
4320.6,neural computational problem. 
4322.25,"- Yeah, yeah. "
4323.69,"And coming from the linguistic world, "
4327.86,"and even just the regular neurobiology world, "
4330.08,going back to something I said before 
4331.79,about a separate language module in the brain. 
4334.4,"You know, there was this thought or hypothesis "
4336.74,that this language module 
4338.57,has all these complex algorithms to them. 
4341.69,"And they're signaling to the speech circuit, "
4344.48,"how to produce the sounds, "
4346.43,"the hand circuit, how to write them or gesture, "
4350.24,the visual pathway on how to interpret them from reading 
4354.38,and the auditory pathway for listening. 
4357.29,"I don't think that's the case, all right. "
4359.93,"And you know, that this thinking where "
4361.7,there's this internal speech going on. 
4363.89,What I think is going on is 
4366.05,"to explain what you're asking is about, "
4368.99,"that I'm going to take it from the perspective, "
4370.49,reading something. 
4371.66,You read something on a paper. 
4373.79,The signal from the paper goes through your eyes. 
4376.76,"It goes to the back of your brain, "
4378.08,to your visual cortical regions eventually. 
4381.44,And then you now got to interpret that signal 
4384.08,in your visual pathway of what you're reading. 
4387.11,How are you going to do that in terms of speech? 
4389.27,That visual signal then goes to your speech pathway 
4392.62,"in the motor cortex in front here, in Broca's area. "
4395.78,And you silently speak what you read 
4398.78,in your brain without moving your muscles. 
4401.33,"And sometimes actually, if you put electrodes, EEG, "
4405.8,"EMG electrodes on your laryngeal muscles, "
4408.95,"even on birds, you can do this, "
4410.57,you'll see activity there while reading 
4413.87,"or trying to speak silently, "
4416.39,even though no sound's coming out. 
4418.55,And so your speech pathway 
4422.03,is now speaking what you're reading. 
4425.54,"Now to finish it off, "
4427.55,that signal is sent to your auditory pathways 
4429.77,so you can hear what you're speaking in your own head. 
4433.28,- That's incredible. 
4434.12,- And this is why it's complicated 
4436.13,"because you're using like three different pathways, "
4439.16,"the visual, the speaking motor one, "
4441.137,and the auditory to read. 
4444.17,"Oh, and then you got to write, right? "
4446.9,"Okay, here comes the fourth one. "
4448.7,Now the hand areas next to your speech pathway 
4451.49,has got to take that auditory signal 
4453.29,or even the adjacent motor signals for speaking 
4456.11,and translate it into a visual signal on paper. 
4459.29,"So, you're using at least four brain circuits, "
4463.43,which includes the speech production 
4465.47,and the speech perception pathways to write. 
4468.35,- Incredible. 
4469.55,"And finally, explain to me why, "
4473.03,"so I was weaned teaching undergraduates, "
4475.7,graduate students and medical students 
4477.23,"and I've observed that when I'm teaching, "
4480.56,I have to stop speaking 
4481.97,if I'm going to write something on the board. 
4484.25,I just have to stop all speaking completely. 
4486.68,- [Erich] Right. 
4487.719,- It turns out this is an advantage to catch 
4489.14,because it allows me to catch my voice. 
4491.36,"It allows me to slow down a bit, you know, "
4493.91,breathe and inhale some oxygen and so on 
4496.46,because I tend to speak quickly 
4497.69,if I'm not writing something out. 
4499.85,"So there's a break in the circuitry for me, "
4502.04,or at least they are distinct enough 
4503.63,that I have to stop and then write something out. 
4506.57,"- Yes, that does imply competing brain circuits "
4510.38,for your conscious attention. 
4513.89,- We have colleagues up at Columbia Med 
4516.92,"who are known, at least in our circles, "
4519.98,"for voice dictating their papers, not writing them out, "
4523.61,but just speaking into a voice recorder. 
4526.25,I've written papers that way. 
4527.72,It doesn't feel quite as natural for me 
4531.47,as writing things out. - Yeah. 
4532.88,- But not because I can go quickly from thought 
4535.67,to language to typing. 
4536.883,I type reasonably fast. 
4538.25,I can touch type now. 
4539.33,"I don't think I ever taught my, "
4540.59,I think I taught myself. 
4541.61,I never took a touch typing course. 
4543.23,But it just sort of happened. 
4544.063,"Now, I think, my motor system "
4545.81,seems to know where the keys are 
4547.34,"with enough accuracy, that it works. "
4553.07,This is remarkable to me that any of us can do this. 
4556.28,"But when it comes to writing, "
4559.31,what I've found is that if my rate of thought 
4562.94,"and my rate of writing are aligned nicely, things go well. "
4567.98,"However, if I'm thinking much faster than I can write, "
4571.4,that's a problem. 
4572.72,"And certainly, if I'm thinking more slowly "
4575.18,"than I want to write, that's also a problem. "
4577.94,And the solution for me 
4579.59,has been to write with a pen. 
4581.48,I'm in love with these. 
4582.53,"And I have no relationship to the company, "
4584.45,"at least not now, although if they want to come, "
4586.13,"you know, if they want to work with us, "
4587.84,I love these Pilot V
"5,",V
7's,
4589.85,because not necessarily because of the ink 
4592.49,"or the feel, although I like that as well. "
4594.59,"But because of the rate that it allows me to write, "
4597.26,"they write very well slowly, "
4598.58,and they write very well quickly. 
4600.5,"And so I have this theory, "
4603.98,"supported only by my own anecdata, "
4606.65,"no peer reviewed study, "
4608.24,that writing by hand is fundamentally different 
4613.28,than typing out information. 
4615.74,Is there any evidence that this motor pathway for writing 
4620.81,is better or somehow different 
4624.38,than the motor pathway for typing? 
4626.93,"- Yeah, that's interesting. "
4629.36,And I don't know of any studies. 
4631.7,"I have my own personal experience as well, "
4633.47,"but trying to put this into the context, "
4636.2,"if I had to, you know, "
4638.06,"design an experiment to test the hypothesis here that, "
4641.295,"you know, to explain your experience and mine, "
4643.67,"is that writing by hand, "
4646.7,"I would argue, requires a different set of less skills "
4652.07,with the fingers than typing. 
4655.04,So you have to coordinate your fingers more 
4658.25,"in opposite directions and so forth with typing, "
4662.69,but also writing by hand requires more arm movement. 
4666.445,"And so therefore, I would argue that "
4672.474,the difficulty there could be 
4675.2,in the types of muscles and the fine motor control 
4678.83,you need of those muscles 
4680.15,along with speaking in your brain at the same time. 
4682.49,"- So basically, I'm a course, I'm a brute. "
4684.53,"So it makes sense that I would have, "
4686.013,a more primitive writing device would work. 
4687.98,"- That's right, yes. "
4689.09,"But, let me answer this in terms "
4693.259,"of my own personal experience, right. "
4694.733,What I find is I can write something faster by hand 
4702.38,"for a short period of time, compared to typing. "
4705.59,And that is because I think 
4706.82,I run out of the energy in my arm movements 
4710.72,faster than I run out of muscle energy 
4712.79,in my finger movements. 
4715.58,And I think it takes longer time 
4718.46,"for us to write words with our fingers, "
4721.31,"because, and in terms of the speech. "
4723.83,"So I think your writing, "
4726.08,"whether it's by hand or typing and your speech, "
4729.29,they only will align very well 
4731.69,if you can type as fast as you can speak 
4734.54,or write as fast as you can speak in your head. 
4736.61,- I love it. 
4737.443,"So what you've done, if I understand correctly, "
4739.4,"is created a bridge between thought and writing, "
4742.73,and that bridge is speech. 
4744.74,"- That bridge is speech, that's right. "
4747.08,That's right. 
4747.913,"When you're writing something out, "
4749.12,you're speaking it to yourself. 
4751.19,"And if you're speaking faster than you can type, "
4753.44,you've got a problem. 
4755.39,- Interesting. 
4756.874,"I do a number of podcast episodes that are not with guests, "
4759.41,but solo episodes. 
4760.4,"And as listeners know, "
4761.45,"these are very long episodes, often two or more hours. "
4764.63,And we joke around the podcast studio 
4767.6,that I will get locked into a mode of speech 
4770.54,where some of it is more collaborative and anecdotal 
4774.32,and then I'll punch out simple declarative sentences. 
4778.46,I find it very hard to switch from one module to the next. 
4782.09,The thing that I have done 
4783.95,in order to make that transition more fluid 
4787.43,and prep for those podcast episodes 
4789.92,is actually to read the lyrics of songs 
4793.43,and to sing them in my head 
4795.71,as a way of warming up my vocal chords. 
4797.72,"But luckily for those around me, when I do that, "
4801.29,I'm not actually singing out loud. 
4803.75,"And so this, what you're telling me "
4806.99,supports this idea that even when we are imagining singing 
4812.15,"or writing in our mind, "
4814.22,we are exercising our vocal chords. 
4816.47,- You're actually getting little low potentials 
4819.8,"of electrical currents reaching your muscles there, "
4822.77,which also means you're exercising 
4824.21,"your speech brain circuits too, without actually, you know, "
4827.06,going with the full-blown activity in the muscles. 
4829.91,- Incredible. - Yeah. 
4830.743,And this idea of singing helps you as well. 
4836.0,"Even with Parkinson's patients and so forth, "
4838.07,"when they want to say something, "
4839.03,singing or listening to music helps them move better. 
4841.31,"And the idea there is that the brain circuits for singing, "
4845.18,or let's say the function of the brain circuits for speech 
4847.94,being used for singing first is the more ancestral trait. 
4851.45,And that's why it's easier to do things with singing 
4854.27,sometimes than it is with speaking. 
4856.22,- I love it. 
4858.17,Stutter is a particularly interesting case 
4862.28,"and one that every once in a while, "
4864.86,I'll get questions about this from our audience. 
4868.34,"Stutter is complicated in a number of ways, "
4871.1,"but culturally, and my understanding from these emails "
4874.55,that I receive is that 
4875.84,stutter can often cause people to hide and speak less 
4880.19,because it can be embarrassing. 
4881.99,And we are often not patient with stutter. 
4885.17,"We also have the assumption that if somebody's stuttering, "
4887.54,"that they're thinking is slow, "
4888.62,"but it turns out there are many examples, "
4890.93,"historically of people who could not speak well, "
4893.15,but who were brilliant thinkers. 
4896.39,"I don't know how well they could write, "
4897.92,but they found other modes of communication. 
4901.34,"I realize that you're not a speech pathologist or therapist, "
4905.12,but what is the current neurobiological 
4908.24,understanding of stutter 
4909.44,"and, or what's being developed "
4911.9,in terms of treatments for stutter? 
4913.55,"- Yeah, so we actually accidentally "
4917.78,came across stuttering in songbirds. 
4920.3,And we've published several papers on this 
4923.0,to try to figure out the neurobiological basis. 
4924.92,The first study we had was a brain area 
4928.4,"called the basal ganglio, "
4929.6,or the striatum part of the basal ganglia 
4932.99,"involved in coordinating movements, "
4934.91,"learning how to make movements, "
4936.83,"when it was damaged in a speech-like pathway in these birds, "
4942.11,what we found is that they started to stutter 
4945.26,as the brain region recovered. 
4948.08,"And unlike humans, "
4950.75,they actually recovered after three or four months. 
4953.75,And why is that the case? 
4954.86,Because bird brains undergoes new neurogenesis 
4958.13,in a way that human or mammal brains don't. 
4961.79,And it was the new neurons that were coming in 
4965.0,"into the circuit, but not quite, you know, "
4967.85,with the right proper activity 
4970.58,"was resulting in this stuttering, in these birds. "
4974.48,"And after it was repaired, "
4975.89,"not exactly the old song came back after the repair, "
4979.82,but still it recovered a lot better. 
4982.37,"And it's now known, "
4984.02,"they call this neurogenic stuttering in humans, "
4989.06,damage to the basal ganglia 
4990.5,or some type of disruption 
4992.45,"to the basal ganglia at a young age, "
4994.43,also causes stuttering in humans. 
4996.71,"And even those who are born with stuttering, "
5001.51,it's often the basal ganglia that's disrupted 
5004.9,than some other brain circuit 
5006.49,and we think the speech part of the basal ganglia. 
5009.46,- Can adults who maintain a stutter from childhood 
5013.0,repair that stutter? 
5014.41,"- They can repair it with therapy, "
5016.81,"with learning how to speak slower, "
5019.45,learning how to tap out a rhythm. 
5022.0,"And yeah, I'm not a speech pathologist, "
5023.77,but I started reading this literature 
5025.84,"and talking to others, that you know, "
5028.0,colleagues who actually study stuttering. 
5030.49,"So yes, there are ways to overcome the stuttering "
5034.93,"through, you know, behavioral therapy. "
5039.76,And I think all of the tools out there 
5044.14,"have something to do with sensory motor integration, "
5047.77,controlling what you hear with what you output 
5051.31,in a thoughtful controlled way helps reduce the stuttering. 
5055.93,- There are a couple examples from real life 
5057.67,"that I want to touch on, "
5058.927,"and one is somewhat facetious, "
5061.319,"but now I realize, is a serious neurobiological issue, "
5066.22,serious meaning I think interesting. 
5068.62,"Which is that every once in a while, "
5071.17,I will have a conversation with somebody 
5073.15,who says the last word of the sentence along with me. 
5077.05,"And it seems annoying in some instances, "
5080.83,but I'm guessing this is just a breakthrough 
5082.9,of the motor pattern 
5083.86,that they're hearing what I'm saying very well. 
5086.32,So I'm going to interpret this kindly 
5087.82,and think they're hearing what I'm saying. 
5090.01,They're literally hearing it in their mind 
5093.55,and they're getting that low-level electrical activity 
5096.55,to their throat. 
5097.39,And they're just joining me 
5100.209,"in the enunciation of what I'm saying, "
5102.67,probably without realizing it. 
5104.68,Can we assume that that might be the case? 
5106.27,"- Well, I wouldn't be surprised so that, you know, "
5108.79,the motor theory of speech perception 
5110.8,"where this idea originally came, "
5112.12,what you hear is going through your speech circuit 
5115.42,and then also activating those muscles slightly. 
5119.44,"So yes, so one might argue, "
5123.61,"okay, is that speech circuit now interpreting "
5126.37,what that person is speaking? 
5127.9,"Now, you're listening to me "
5129.52,and is going to finish it off 
5130.96,because it's already going through their brain 
5133.87,and they can predict it? 
5134.8,That would be one theory. 
5136.9,"And I don't think the verdict out there is known, "
5138.82,but that's one. 
5139.99,The other is synchronizing turn-taking in the conversation 
5147.49,where you're acknowledging that we understand each other 
5152.05,by finishing off what I say. 
5155.455,And it's almost like a social bonding kind of thing. 
5158.56,"The other could be, "
5159.58,I want the person to shut up 
5160.78,so I can speak as well and take that turn. 
5163.21,And each pair of people have a rhythm to their conversation. 
5168.31,And if you have somebody who's over talkative 
5170.41,"versus under talkative of vice versa, "
5172.84,that rhythm can be lost in them finishing ideas 
5175.48,and going back and forth. 
5176.92,"But I think having something to do with turn-taking, "
5180.37,"as well, makes a lot of sense. "
5182.32,- I have a colleague at Stanford who says 
5184.27,that interruption is a sign of interest. 
5187.379,[Erich laughs] 
5188.212,I'm not sure that everyone agrees. 
5189.19,I think it's highly contextual. 
5190.69,- [Erich] Yes. 
5191.523,- But there is this form of a verbal nod 
5194.65,"of saying, hmm hmm or things of that sort. "
5196.42,And they're many of these. 
5198.67,"And I'm often told by my audience, you know, "
5200.74,that I interrupt my guests and things of that sort. 
5203.11,"Oftentimes, I'll just get caught in the natural flow "
5205.06,"of the conversation, but. - Right. "
5206.66,"Well, I think we've had pretty good turn-taking here, "
5209.68,I hope. 
5210.513,- So far so good. - I feel that way. 
5211.87,"- I'm glad you feel that way, "
5213.07,because especially in the context of a discussion 
5214.93,about language. - Yes. 
5216.25,- It seems important. 
5219.19,"Texting is a very, very interesting evolution of language "
5225.67,"because what you've told us is that we have a thought, "
5229.54,it's translated into language. 
5231.52,"It might not be complete sentences, "
5233.02,"but texting, I have to imagine this is the first time "
5235.75,in human evolution where we've written with our thumbs. 
5238.6,"So I don't know, "
5240.01,it seems more primitive to me than typing with fingers 
5242.05,"or writing with hands, but hey, "
5243.07,who am I to judge the evolution of our species 
5245.74,in one direction or the other? 
5247.3,"But the shorthand grammatically, "
5251.38,often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form 
5254.65,of texting is an incredible thing to see. 
5258.76,"Early in relationships, romantic relationships, "
5261.31,people will often evaluate the others text 
5264.28,and their ability to use proper grammar 
5267.1,"and spelling, et cetera. "
5268.51,This often quickly degrades. 
5270.67,And there's an acceptance 
5271.87,"that we're just trying to communicate through shorthand, "
5274.33,"almost military like shorthand, "
5277.9,"but with internally consistent between people, "
5280.69,"but there's no general consensus of what things mean, "
5282.94,"but, you know, WTFs and like, "
5285.94,and OMGs and all sorts of things. 
5287.59,- [Erich] Right. 
5289.39,- I wonder sometimes whether or not 
5291.37,we are getting less proficient at speech 
5294.82,because we are not required to write and think 
5299.17,in complete sentences. - Hmm hmm. 
5301.69,- I'm not being judgemental here. 
5302.92,I see this in my colleagues. 
5304.36,I see this in myself. 
5305.98,This is not a judgment of the younger generation. 
5309.91,"I also know that slang has existed for decades, "
5314.89,if not hundreds of years. 
5316.36,But I also know that I don't speak the same way 
5318.28,"that I did when I was a teenager, "
5320.26,"because I've suppressed a lot of that slang, "
5322.33,"not because it's inappropriate or offensive, "
5325.3,"although some of it was, frankly, "
5328.12,but because it's out of context. 
5330.52,So what do you think's happening to language? 
5333.04,"Are we getting better at speaking, worse at speaking? "
5336.1,And what do you think the role of things 
5338.26,like texting and tweeting 
5339.7,"and shorthand communication, hashtagging, "
5342.97,what's that doing to the way that our brains work? 
5345.31,"- Yeah, I think that, "
5348.01,"well, one, in terms of, you know, "
5351.55,measuring your level of sophistication and intelligence 
5354.37,"when you say OMG, right. "
5356.59,I think that also could be a cultural thing 
5359.08,"that, ah, you belong to the next generation. "
5361.93,"If you're an, you know, "
5362.98,"or you're being cool, "
5363.91,"if you're an older person, you know, "
5365.98,"using OMG and other things that the, you know, "
5369.04,younger generation would use. 
5371.05,"But if I really think about it clearly, "
5376.33,texting actually has allowed 
5379.33,for more rapid communication amongst people. 
5384.119,"I think, without the invention of the phone before then, "
5387.67,"or, you know, texting back and forth, "
5390.1,you had to wait days for a letter to show up. 
5393.37,You couldn't call somebody on the phone 
5394.81,"and talk as well, you know? "
5395.947,And so this rapid communication 
5397.87,in terms of the rapid communication of writing in this case. 
5401.59,"So I think actually, "
5404.02,it's more like a use it or lose it 
5406.54,kind of a thing with the brain. 
5410.14,"The more you use a particular brain region or circuit, "
5413.62,the more enhanced. 
5414.52,It's like a muscle. 
5416.32,"The more you exercise it, the more healthier it is, "
5419.11,the bigger it becomes and the more space it takes 
5421.21,and the more you lose something else. 
5423.37,So I think texting is not decreasing 
5430.54,"the speech prowess, "
5432.04,or the intellectual prowess of speech. 
5434.23,"It's converting it and using it a lot in a different way, "
5438.94,"in a way that may not be as rich in regular writing, "
5443.26,because you can only communicate so much nuance 
5447.55,"in short-term writing, "
5449.62,"but whatever is being done, "
5453.19,you got people texting hours and hours 
5455.29,and hours on the phone. 
5456.55,"So whatever, your thumb circuit is going to get pretty big, "
5460.36,actually. [laughs] 
5462.01,"- I do wonder whether, you know, "
5464.29,many people have lost their jobs based on tweets. 
5467.08,- [Erich] Hmm hmm. 
5468.1,- The short latency between thought and action 
5471.55,and distribution of one's thoughts 
5473.83,is incredible. - Yes. 
5475.93,- And I'm not just talking about people 
5480.07,who apparently would have poor prefrontal top-down control. 
5483.97,"This is geek speak by the way, "
5485.26,for people that lack impulse control. 
5487.36,"But high-level academics, "
5488.86,I'm not going to point fingers at anyone. 
5490.54,"But examples of where you see these tweets and you go, "
5493.57,what were they thinking? - Yep. 
5495.85,"- So presumably, there's an optimal strategy "
5499.81,"between the thought speech motor pathway, "
5504.4,especially when the motor pathway engages communication 
5507.34,with hundreds of thousands of people 
5509.17,and retweets in particular 
5510.64,and the cut and paste function 
5511.473,and the screenshot function 
5513.22,are often the reason why speech propagates. 
5515.68,- [Erich] Yep. 
5516.513,"- So to me, it's a little eerie that, "
5520.6,just that the neural circuitry can do this 
5524.32,and that we are catching up a little bit more slowly 
5528.85,"to the technology, "
5530.14,and you've got these casualties of that mismatch. 
5533.8,"- I think that's a good adjective used, the casualties, "
5539.32,"you know, of what's going on, "
5540.37,"because yes, it is the case with texting, "
5543.31,what you're really losing there 
5545.47,"is less so the ability to write, "
5548.32,but more the ability to interpret what is being written. 
5552.01,And you can over or under interpret 
5553.75,something that somebody means. 
5557.65,"On the flip side of that, you know, "
5560.2,"if somebody's writing something very quick, "
5563.59,"they could be writing instinctually, "
5566.11,"more instinctually, their true meaning, "
5569.29,and they don't have time to modify 
5571.84,and color code what they're trying to say. 
5575.05,And that's what they really feel 
5577.72,and as opposed to saying it in a more nuanced way. 
5580.21,So I think both sides of that casualty are present. 
5585.04,"And that's a downturn, you know, "
5587.35,"unintended negative consequence of short-term, "
5592.51,"I mean, short-word communications. "
5594.82,"- Yeah, I agree that this whole phenomenon "
5597.4,could be netting people that normally 
5600.58,would only say these things out loud 
5602.29,once inside the door of their own home. 
5604.15,- Right. - Or not at all. 
5605.11,- [Erich] Right. 
5606.37,- It's an interesting time that we're in. 
5608.29,These are these speech and language and motor patterns. 
5611.172,"- So part of the human evolution for language, "
5612.88,I think this is all part of our evolution. 
5615.31,- That's right. - Yeah. 
5616.722,"- So for those of you thinking terrible thoughts, "
5618.25,please put them in the world and be a casualty. 
5620.2,"And for those of you that are not, "
5621.52,please be very careful with how proficient 
5624.16,your thought to language to motor action goes. 
5627.085,- [Erich] Yes. [laughs] 
5627.97,- Maybe the technology companies 
5629.38,"should install some buffers, some AI-based buffers. "
5632.65,"- Right, that's taking some EEG signals "
5634.81,"from your brain while you're texting to say, "
5636.85,"okay, this is not a great thought, slow down. "
5640.99,"- Right, or this doesn't reflect your best state. "
5644.86,That brings me to 
5646.18,"what was going to be the next question anyway, "
5648.22,which is we are quickly moving toward a time 
5650.89,where there will be an even faster transition 
5655.24,"from thought to speech, to motor output, "
5658.6,and maybe won't require motor output. 
5660.76,What I'm referring to here 
5661.63,"is some of the incredible work of our colleagues, "
5664.3,Eddie Chang at UCSF and others 
5666.01,who are taking paralyzed human beings 
5669.55,and learning to translate the electrical signals 
5672.49,"of neurons in various areas, "
5673.81,"including speech and language areas, "
5675.52,to computer screens that type out 
5677.5,what these people are thinking. 
5678.4,"In other words, "
5679.233,paralyzed people can put their thoughts into writing. 
5682.33,That's a pretty extreme and wonderful example 
5685.21,of recovery of function. - Hmm hmm. 
5687.7,- That is sure to continue to evolve. 
5690.34,"But I think we are headed toward a time, "
5692.83,not too long from now 
5694.0,where my thoughts can be translated into words on a page 
5698.53,if I allow that to happen. 
5700.45,"- Yeah so, and Eddie Chang's work, "
5703.0,"which I admire quite a bit and cite in my papers, "
5707.2,I think he's really one of those at the leading edge 
5710.17,"of trying to understand within humans, "
5713.47,the neurobiology of speech. 
5715.6,"And he may not say it directly, but you know, "
5717.82,I talked to him about this. 
5718.99,It supports this idea that the speech circuit 
5721.96,"and the separate language module, "
5723.61,I don't really think that there's a separation there. 
5726.85,"So with that knowledge, "
5728.8,"yes, and putting electrodes into human brain "
5731.32,and then translating those electrical signals 
5733.39,to speech currents. 
5734.83,"Yeah, we can start to tell what is that person thinking? "
5738.25,"Why, because we often think in terms of speech. "
5742.21,And without saying words. 
5744.97,And that's a scary thought. 
5746.5,And now imagine if you can now translate 
5749.32,those into a signal that transmits something wirelessly 
5752.62,and someone from some distant part of the planet 
5755.65,is hearing your speech from a wireless signal 
5758.71,without you speaking. 
5760.96,"So probably that won't be done in an ethical way, "
5764.77,"who knows, you know? "
5766.854,"But I mean, the ethics of doing that probably, "
5768.97,"you know, might not happen, but who knows? "
5771.1,"We have these songbirds, you know. "
5773.774,"If we apply the same technique to them, "
5775.0,we can start to hear what they're singing 
5776.41,"in their dreams or whatever, "
5778.48,even though they don't produce sound 
5779.8,so we can find out by testing on them. 
5782.35,- It's coming. - Yes. 
5783.28,"- One way or another, it's coming. "
5786.13,For those listening who are interested 
5788.23,"in getting better at speaking and understanding languages, "
5792.49,are there any tools that you recommend? 
5794.74,"And here again, "
5796.354,"I realize you're not a speech therapist, "
5797.86,but here I'm not thinking about 
5799.12,ameliorating any kind of speech deficiency. 
5802.24,"I'm thinking, for instance, "
5804.07,do you recommend that people read 
5806.77,different types of writing? 
5809.47,Would you recommend that people learn how to dance 
5811.42,in order to become better at expressing themselves verbally? 
5815.5,"You know, and feel free to have some degrees of freedom "
5820.48,in this answer. 
5821.59,These are obviously not peer-reviewed studies 
5824.2,"that we're referring to, although there may be, "
5827.14,but I'm struck by the number of things 
5830.11,"that you do exceedingly well, "
5831.52,"and I can't help but ask, "
5833.649,"well, the singing, which I realize it may, "
5837.7,"your brother didn't pay me to say this, "
5838.96,"may not be quite as good as your brothers yet, "
5841.42,"but is getting, you'll surpass him, "
5843.19,I'm guessing at some point. 
5844.353,â™ª Getting there â™ª 
5845.254,- Getting there. 
5846.087,[both laughing] 
5846.92,"Exactly, there you go. "
5849.67,"You know, should kids learn how to dance "
5852.28,and read hard books and simple books? 
5855.94,What do you recommend? 
5856.773,Should adults learn how to do that? 
5858.07,Everyone wants to know how 
5858.903,"to keep their brain working better, so to speak. "
5861.76,But also I think people want to be able to speak well 
5864.61,and people want to be able to understand well. 
5866.62,"- Yeah, so what I've discovered personally, right, "
5870.58,"is that, so when I switched "
5872.35,"from pursuing a career in science from a career in dance, "
5879.61,"I thought one day I would stop dancing, "
5882.58,"but I haven't because I find it fulfilling for me, "
5886.87,"you know, just as a life experience. "
5889.18,"So ever since I started college, "
5891.76,"you know, my late teens and early twenties, "
5895.36,I kept dancing even till this day. 
5898.39,"And there've been periods of time, "
5899.5,like during the pandemic 
5901.0,where I slowed down on dancing and so forth. 
5904.3,"And when you do that, you realize, okay, "
5906.43,there are parts of your body 
5907.78,"where your muscle tone decreases a little bit and somewhat, "
5910.694,or you could start to gain weight. 
5912.64,I somehow don't gain weight that easily. 
5914.29,"And I think it's related to my dance, "
5915.88,if that's meaningful to your audience. 
5918.97,"But what I found is, you know, "
5922.557,"in science, we like to think of a separation "
5924.79,between movement and action and cognition. 
5928.3,And there is a separation for you 
5929.65,"between perception and production, "
5931.66,"cognition being perception, "
5933.58,"production being moving, right. "
5935.83,But if the speech pathways 
5937.84,"is next to the movement pathways, "
5939.82,"what I discover is by dancing, "
5942.34,it is helping me think. 
5944.95,It is helping keeping my brain fresh. 
5947.2,"It's not just moving my muscles, "
5949.27,I'm moving or using the circuitry in my brain 
5953.05,to control a whole big body. 
5956.44,You need a lot of brain tissue to do that. 
5958.75,"And so I argue, "
5959.89,"if you want to stay cognitively intact into your old age, "
5965.23,you better be moving 
5966.55,"and you better be doing it consistently, "
5968.38,"whether it's dancing, walking, running, "
5971.14,"and also practicing speech, "
5974.41,"oratory speech and so forth or singing, "
5976.84,is controlling the brain circuits 
5978.58,that are moving your facial musculature. 
5980.47,And it's going to keep your cognitive circuits also in tune. 
5984.64,And I'm convinced of that from my own personal experience. 
5987.97,"- Yeah, for me, long, slow runs "
5990.88,are a wonderful way to kind of loosen the joints 
5994.24,"for long podcasts, especially the solo podcast, "
5998.11,which can take many hours to record. 
6000.12,"And without those long slow runs, "
6003.27,"at least the day before, or even the morning of, "
6005.82,"I don't think I could do it, at least not as well. "
6008.19,"- All right, well, you're experiencing something similar. "
6010.74,So that's an N of two. 
6011.94,"- Yeah, N of two. "
6013.77,I'm tempted to learn how to dance 
6015.72,because there are a lot of reasons to learn how to dance. 
6018.218,- [Erich] Yes. 
6019.051,- And people can use their imagination. 
6021.06,I definitely want to get the opportunity 
6023.64,to talk about some of the newer work 
6025.89,that you're into right now about genomes of animals. 
6030.87,As you perhaps can tell 
6032.43,"from my quite authentic facial expressions, "
6035.07,I adore the animal kingdom. 
6037.92,I just find it amazing. 
6039.12,"And it's the reason I went into neurobiology, in part. "
6042.93,"So many animals, so many different patterns of movement, "
6045.42,"so many body plans, so many specializations, "
6049.41,what is the value of learning the genomes 
6051.96,of all these animals? 
6053.85,"You know, I can think of conservation-based, you know, "
6058.23,"schemes of trying to preserve these precious critters, "
6062.1,but what are you doing with the genomes of these animals? 
6064.17,What do you want to understand about their brain circuits? 
6066.537,And how does this relate to some of the discussion 
6068.43,we've have been having up until now? 
6069.33,"- Yeah, I've gotten very heavily involved in genomes, "
6074.4,"you know, not just to get at an individual gene "
6076.98,"involved in the trade of interest, like spoken language, "
6081.48,"but I realize that, you know, "
6084.78,nature has done natural experiments for us 
6088.62,with all these species out there with these various traits 
6091.62,"and the one that I'm studying, like vocal learning, "
6093.84,"has evolved multiple times among the animal kingdom, "
6096.48,"even if it's rare, it's multiple times. "
6099.51,And the similar genetic changes occurred in those species. 
6105.81,But to find out what those genetic changes 
6108.39,that are associated with the trait of interests 
6110.58,"and not some other trait like flying in birds, "
6113.4,"as opposed to singing, "
6116.49,"you have to do what's called comparative genomics, "
6118.83,even in the context of studying the brain. 
6121.017,And you need their genomes to compare the genomes 
6124.17,"and do like a GWA, a genome-wide association study, "
6127.2,"not just within a species like humans, but across species. "
6130.62,And so you need good genomes to do that. 
6133.53,"Plus, I've discovered I'm also interested "
6136.23,in evolution and origins. 
6137.88,How did these species come about a similar trait 
6142.35,"in last, you know, "
300,million years or 
60,"million years, "
6145.95,depending who you're talking about. 
6147.72,"And you need a good phylogenetic tree to do that, "
6150.9,"and to get a good phylogenetic tree, "
6152.64,you also need their genomes. 
6154.59,"And so, because of this, "
6155.94,I got involved in large scale consortiums 
6158.64,"to produce genomes of many different species, "
6161.82,including my vocal learners 
6163.23,and their closest relatives that I'm fans of. 
6167.4,But I couldn't convince the funding agencies 
6169.23,to gimme the money to do that just for my own project. 
6172.62,But when you get a whole bunch of people together 
6175.35,"who want to study various traits, "
6177.21,"you know, heart disease, "
6179.43,"or loss and gain in flight and so forth, "
6183.51,suddenly we all need lots of genomes to do this. 
6186.84,And so now that got me into a project 
6189.69,to lead something called the Vertebrate Genomes Project 
6192.66,to eventually sequence all 
"70,",
000,species on the planet. 
6196.74,"And Earth BioGenome Project, "
6198.9,"all eukaryotic species, all two million of them. "
6203.16,And to no longer be in a situation 
6206.79,where I wish I had this genome. 
6208.95,"Now we have the genetic code of all life on the planet, "
6212.31,create a database of all their traits 
6214.62,and find the genetic association 
6216.6,with everything out there 
6218.97,that makes a difference from one species to another. 
6222.45,One more piece of the equation to add to this story 
6227.4,is what I didn't realize as a neuroscientist 
6230.88,"were that these genomes are not only incomplete, "
6235.17,"but have lots of errors in them, "
6238.23,"false gene duplications, "
6240.15,where mother and father chromosomes 
6241.8,"were so different from each other, "
6243.93,"that the genome algorithm, "
6245.58,assembly algorithms treated them as two different genes 
6248.34,in this part of the chromosome. 
6250.5,So there are a lot of these false duplicated genes 
6252.9,"that people thought were real, but were not "
6256.17,or missing parts of the genome 
6258.48,because the enzymes used to sequence the DNA 
6261.75,couldn't get through this regulatory region 
6263.85,that folded up on itself 
6266.16,and made it hard to sequence. 
6268.56,And so I ended up in these consortiums 
6272.7,"pulling in the genome sequencing companies, "
6275.64,developing the technology to work with us 
6278.73,to improve it further 
6280.05,and the computer science guys 
6282.27,"who then take that data and that technology, "
6284.55,and try to make the complete genomes 
6286.29,and make the algorithms better 
6288.3,to produce what we now just did recently 
6291.87,led by an effort by Adam Phillippy 
6293.79,is the first human Telomere-to-Telomere Genome 
6296.52,"with no errors, all complete, no missing sequence. "
6300.75,And now we're trying to do the same thing with vertebrates 
6304.02,and other species. 
6304.853,"Actually, we improved that before we got to the, "
6307.263,"what we call telomere-to-telomere, "
6309.03,from one end of the chromosome to another. 
6311.22,And what we're discovering 
6313.59,is in this dark matter of the genome 
6315.78,"that was missing before, "
6317.67,turns out to be some regulatory regions 
6320.55,that are specialized in vocal learning species 
6323.34,and we think are involved in developing speech circuits. 
6326.58,- Incredible. 
6327.413,"Well, so much to learn. "
6329.7,And we're going to learn from this information. 
6332.13,"Early on in these genome projects and connectome projects, "
6335.28,I confess I was a little bit cynical. 
6337.02,This would be about 
"10,",
15,years ago. 
6339.06,"I thought, okay, necessary, "
6340.38,but not sufficient for anything. 
6342.63,"We need it, but it's not clear what's going to happen, "
6344.58,but you just gave a very clear example 
6346.23,of what we stand to learn from this kind of information. 
6349.62,"And I know from the conservation side, "
6352.59,there's a huge interest in this 
6353.79,because even though we would prefer 
6355.41,"to keep all these species alive rather than clone them, "
6358.8,these sorts of projects do offer the possibility 
6361.32,of potentially recreating species that were lost. 
6364.23,- [Erich] Right. 
6365.063,"- Due to our own ignorance or missteps, or what have you. "
6369.36,"- Yes, and along those lines, "
6373.44,"because, you know, we got involved in genomics, "
6376.11,some of the first species that we start working on 
6379.35,are critically endangered species. 
6381.54,"And I'm doing that not only for, you know, "
6385.86,perspectives to understand their brains 
6387.51,"and the genes involved in their brain function, "
6389.37,but I feel like it's a moral duty. 
6391.8,So the fact that now I become more involved 
6394.56,in genome biology 
6396.09,and have helped develop these tools 
6397.65,"for more complete genomes, "
6399.03,"let's capture their genetic code now, before they're gone. "
6403.83,And could we use that information 
6406.56,"to resurrect the species at some future time, "
6409.44,"if not in my lifetime, "
6410.94,in some time in the future and generations ahead of us. 
6414.78,"And so, in anticipation of that, "
6419.55,"we create a database, we call the GenomeArk "
6423.06,"and no pun intended like Noah's Ark, "
6425.94,meant to store the genetic code 
6428.31,as complete genome assemblies as possible 
6430.83,for all species on the planet 
6433.2,"to be used for basic science, "
6434.67,but also some point in the future. 
6437.31,"And because of that, "
6439.38,funding agencies or private foundations 
6441.69,that are interested in conservation 
6443.46,"have been reaching out to me now, a neuroscientist, "
6446.64,to help them out in producing high quality genome data 
6450.36,"of endangered species that they can use, "
6452.43,"like Revive & Restore, "
6454.14,who want to resurrect the passenger pigeon 
6456.54,"or Colossal, who wants to resurrect the wooly mammoth. "
6459.75,And so we're producing high quality genomes 
6461.97,"for these groups, for the conservation projects. "
6464.7,- What a terrific and important initiative. 
6467.25,"And I think for those listening today, "
6469.11,they now certainly understand the value 
6473.311,of deeply understanding the brain structures 
6476.49,and genomes of different species. 
6478.41,"Because I confess, "
6480.33,"even though I knew a bit of the songbird literature, "
6482.82,and I certainly understand 
6483.87,"that humans have speech and language, "
6485.46,I had no idea that there was so much convergence 
6488.07,"of function, structure and genomes. "
6490.257,"And to me, you know, I feel a lot more like "
6493.38,an ape than I do a songbird. - Right. 
6496.08,- And yet here we are with the understanding 
6498.573,that there's a lot more similarity 
6500.4,between songbirds and humans 
6502.68,than I certainly ever thought before. 
6504.39,"- Yeah, something very close to home for us humans, "
6507.39,I can give you an example of is evolution of skin color. 
6512.01,"And skin color, we use it unfortunately, "
6515.13,for racism and so forth. 
6517.17,We use it also for good things to let in more light 
6519.84,"or let out less light depending on the part of the planet, "
6522.9,"you know, our population evolved in. "
6525.36,And most people think dark-skinned people 
6527.61,all evolved from the same dark-skinned person 
6529.98,and light-skinned people all evolved 
6531.66,"from the same light-skinned person, "
6532.77,but that's not the case. 
6534.42,Dark skin and light skin amongst humans 
6537.45,"has evolved independently multiple times, "
6540.63,"like in, you know, the Pacific islands versus Africa. "
6543.63,And it's just depending on the angle 
6546.36,of light hitting the Earth 
6548.31,as to whether you need more protection from the sun 
6550.65,"or less protection, "
6552.69,that's also associated with Vitamin D synthesis in the skin. 
6556.71,"And so, and each time, "
6562.17,"where darker or lighter skin evolved independently, "
6566.1,"it hit the same gene, you know, "
6568.71,the mela [finger snaps]. 
6570.51,- Melanin. - Melanin receptors. 
6572.34,"That's right, yes, yeah. "
6573.75,Genes that are involved in melanin in formation. 
6577.08,"And so those genes evolve some of the same mutations, "
6581.01,even in different species. 
6582.6,It's not just humans. 
6584.25,"In equatorial regions, they are darker-skinned animals "
6588.15,than going away from the equator. 
6590.52,"- Oh, right, I think of Arctic foxes "
6592.14,"and things of that sort. - Yep, that's right. "
6593.326,"That's right, polar bears, you know, "
6596.19,and so some of the same genes are used 
6600.18,in evolutionary perspective to evolve in a similar way 
6603.09,within and across species. 
6605.07,- Incredible. - Yeah. 
6606.12,And that's same thing happening in the brain too. 
6608.22,Language is no exception. 
6609.9,"- Well, I have to say, "
6610.733,"as somebody who is a, you know, career neuroscientist, "
6614.1,"but as I mentioned several times now, "
6615.75,"who also adores the animal kingdom, "
6618.18,"but is also obsessed with speech and language, "
6623.04,"at a distance not as a practitioner of music and dance, "
6628.71,this has been an incredible conversation 
6631.23,and opportunity for me to learn. 
6632.997,And I know I speak for a tremendous number of people 
6635.577,"and I just really want to say, "
6636.81,thank you for joining us today. 
6638.76,You are incredibly busy. 
6639.96,It's clear from your description of your science 
6642.387,"and your knowledge base, "
6643.47,"that you are involved in a huge number of things, "
6646.62,"very busy, so thank you for taking the time "
6648.51,to speak to all of us. 
6650.25,"Thank you for the work that you're doing, "
6652.02,"both on speech and language, "
6653.61,but also this important work on genomes 
6655.74,and conservation of endangered species and far more. 
6660.66,"And I have to say, "
6662.13,if you would agree to come back 
6663.33,"and speak to us again sometime, "
6664.98,I'm certain that if we were to sit down even six months 
6667.17,"or a year from now, there's going to be a lot more to come. "
6668.92,"- Yeah, we have some things cooking "
6670.939,and thank you for inviting me here 
6673.44,to get the word out to the community 
6676.44,of what's going on in the science world. 
6678.45,"- Well, we're honored and very grateful to you, Erich. "
