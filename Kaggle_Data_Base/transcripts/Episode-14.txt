0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.25 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
5.7 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.235 I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a Professor
11.08 of Neurobiology
and Ophthalmology
13.21 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.01 Today, my guest is
Dr. Lex Fridman Dr.
17.92 Lex Fridman is an expert
in electrical and computer
20.29 engineering, artificial
intelligence, and robotics.
23.17 He is also the host of the
Lex Fridman Podcast, which
26.5 initially started
as a podcast focus
28.27 on technology and
science of various kinds,
30.86 including computer
science and physics,
33.1 but rapidly evolved to include
guests and other topics
36.52 as a matter of focus,
including sport.
40.21 For instance, Dr. Lex
Freedman is a Black Belt
43.09 in Brazilian jujitsu.
44.35 And he's had numerous
guests on who
45.88 come from the fields
of Brazilian jujitsu,
47.77 both from the coaching side
and from the competitor side.
52.18 He also has shown
an active interest
54.43 in topics such as chess
and essentially anything
57.73 that involves intense activation
and engagement of the mind
61.33 and/or body.
62.57 In fact, the Lex
Fridman podcast has
64.12 evolved to take on
very difficult topics
66.85 such as mental health-- he's
had various psychiatrists
69.44 and other guests on that
relate to mental health
71.44 and mental illness, as well as
guest focused on geopolitics
75.7 and some of the more
controversial issues
77.68 that face our times.
79.0 He's had comedians, he's had
scientists, he's had friends,
83.68 he's had enemies on his podcast.
85.96 Lex has a phenomenal, I would
say a 1 in an eight billion
89.86 ability to find these people,
make them comfortable,
94.21 and in that comfort, both
try to understand them
98.53 and to confront them and to
push them so that we all learn.
102.52 All of which is to say that
Lex Fridman is no longer just
105.31 an accomplished scientist,
he certainly is that.
108.01 But he has also become one of
the more preeminent thought
110.59 leaders on the planet.
111.95 And if there's anything
that really captures
113.8 the essence of Lex
Fridman, it's his love
116.32 of learning, his desire to share
with us, the human experience,
120.2 and to broaden that experience
so that we all may benefit.
123.52 In many ways, our discussion
during today's episode
125.95 captures the many
facets of Lex Fridman,
128.35 although no conversation, of
course, could capture them all.
131.56 We sit down to the
conversation just days
133.36 after Lex returned from
Ukraine, where he deliberately
136.48 placed himself into the
tension of that environment
139.57 in order to understand the
geopolitics of the region
142.48 and to understand
exactly what was
144.88 happening at the level of the
ground and the people there.
148.18 You may notice that he carries
quite a lot of both, emotion
152.35 and knowledge and understanding.
154.21 And yet in a very
classic Lex Fridman way,
156.83 you'll notice that
he's able to zoom out
158.65 of his own experience around
any number of different topics
161.5 and view them through
a variety of lenses
164.21 so that first of all, everyone
feel included, but most of all,
168.01 so that everyone learned
something new, that
170.56 is to gain new perspective.
172.51 Our discussion also ventures
into the waters of social media
175.57 and how that
landscape is changing
177.64 the way that science and
technology are communicated.
180.43 We also get into the topics of
motivation drive and purpose,
183.73 both finding it and executing
on that drive and purpose.
187.43 I should mention that this is
episode 100 of the Huberman Lab
190.84 Podcast.
191.62 And I would be remiss
if I did not tell you
194.17 that there would be no
Huberman Lab Podcast,
196.75 were it not for Lex Fridman.
198.4 I was a fan of the
Lex Fridman Podcast
200.38 long before I was ever invited
on to the podcast as a guest.
203.5 And after our first
recording, Lex
205.84 was the one that suggested
that I start a podcast.
208.27 He only gave me two
pieces of advice.
210.32 The first piece of advice
was, start a podcast.
213.31 And the second
piece of advice was
215.23 that I not just make it me
blabbing into the microphone
218.71 and staring at the camera.
220.12 So I can safely say
that I at least followed
222.61 half of his advice, and that
I am ever grateful for Lex,
226.0 both as a friend, a
colleague in science,
228.85 and now fellow podcaster for
making the suggestion that we
232.15 start this podcast.
233.47 I already mentioned
a few of the topics
235.24 covered on today's podcast.
236.74 But I can assure you that
there is far more to the person
240.31 that many of us
know as Lex Fridman.
242.423 If you are somebody interested
in artificial intelligence,
244.84 engineering, or robotics,
today's discussion
247.3 is most certainly for you.
248.87 And if you are not,
but you are somebody
250.63 who is interested in world
politics, and more importantly,
253.48 the human experience,
both the individual
256.24 and the collective
human experience,
258.579 Lex shares what can
only be described
261.13 as incredible insights
into what he views
264.43 as the human experience and what
is optimal in order to derive
268.24 from our time on this planet.
269.83 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
271.602 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
274.06 roles at Stanford.
275.14 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
277.42 to bring zero cost to
consumer information
279.37 about science and
science-related tools
281.23 to the general public.
282.52 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
284.02 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
286.43 Our first sponsor is LMNT.
288.28 LMNT is an electrolyte drink
with everything you need
290.98 and nothing you don't.
292.12 That means the electrolytes,
sodium, potassium,
294.95 and magnesium are in LMNT
in the correct ratios.
297.73 But it has no sugar.
299.68 As I mentioned before
on the podcast,
301.51 electrolytes are
critical to the function
303.4 of every cell in the
body, and especially
305.65 the cells in your brain,
meaning neurons or nerve cells.
309.07 Indeed, the ability
for nerve cells
310.68 to be active and communicate
with one another critically
313.17 depends on sodium,
potassium, and magnesium.
316.02 You can get electrolytes
from a variety of sources.
318.6 But it's often hard to get
them in the proper ratios,
320.91 even from food.
321.99 So if you're somebody who's
exercising a lot and sweating,
324.633 or if you're somebody
following, for instance,
326.55 a low carbohydrate or even a
semi-low carbohydrate diet,
329.88 that will cause you to
excrete electrolytes.
332.04 I tend to have my
LMNT first thing
333.78 in the morning when I wake up
or within the first few hours
336.54 of waking, any time while
or after I'm exercising,
339.57 or I've sweat a lot, such
as exiting the sauna.
341.76 If you'd like to try LMNT
you can go to drinkLMNT--
344.34 that's LMNT..com/Huberman to
claim a free element sample
348.42 pack with your purchase.
349.53 Again, that's drinkLMNT,
LMNT.com/Huberman to my free
354.24 sample pack.
355.02 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Levels.
357.51 Levels is a program
that lets you
359.01 see how different foods affect
your health by giving you
361.343 real-time feedback on your
diet using a continuous glucose
363.99 monitor.
364.77 Now blood glucose or blood
sugar is a critical aspect
367.495 of your immediate
and long term health,
369.12 and indeed, your
feelings of vigor
371.01 and mental clarity and
well-being at any moment.
374.1 One of the key things is to know
how different foods and food
376.74 combinations and
timing of food intake
379.11 is impacting blood glucose.
380.85 And with Levels,
you're able to assess
382.8 all of that in real time.
384.87 I tried Levels.
385.95 And what it taught
me, for instance,
387.49 was that I can eat certain
foods at certain times of day.
389.91 But if I eat them at
other times a day,
391.86 I get a blood sugar crash.
393.51 It also taught me,
for instance, how
395.19 to space my exercise
and my food intake.
398.07 It turns out for me, exercising
fasted is far more beneficial.
401.37 That's something I
learned using Levels.
403.14 And it's completely
transformed, not
404.97 just the spacing and timing
of my diet and exercise,
408.24 but also use of things like
the sauna and other activities.
411.6 It's been a tremendous
learning for me
413.58 that's really shaped an enormous
number of factors in my life
416.19 that have led to me feeling
far more vigorous with far more
419.37 mental focus and physical
strength and endurance.
422.262 So if you're interested in
learning more about Levels
424.47 and trying a continuous
glucose monitor yourself,
426.78 go to levels.link/Huberman.
429.21 Again that's levels.link,
L-I-N-K/Huberman.
432.84 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
435.78 Eight Sleep make smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating,
438.54 and sleep tracking capacity.
440.55 I've talked many
times on this podcast
442.53 about the critical relationship
between sleep and body
445.17 temperature.
446.16 That is in order to fall
asleep and stay deeply asleep
449.3 throughout the night,
our body temperature
451.05 needs to drop by
about 1 to 3 degrees.
453.39 And conversely when we
wake up in the morning,
456.09 that is in large part,
because of our body heating up
459.36 by 1 to 3 degrees.
461.008 Now people have different
core body temperatures.
463.05 And they tend to run colder or
hotter throughout the night.
465.57 Eight Sleep allows you
to adjust the temperature
467.623 of your sleeping
environment so that you
469.29 have the optimal temperature
that gets you the best night's
471.81 sleep.
472.35 I started sleeping on
an Eight Sleep mattress
474.225 cover about eight months ago.
475.53 And it has completely
transformed my sleep.
477.87 I sleep so much deeper,
I wake up far less
480.78 during the middle of
the night, if at all,
482.56 and I wake up feeling far
better than I ever have,
485.04 even after the same
amount of sleep.
487.07 If you want to try
Eight Sleep, you can go
488.82 to eightsleep.com/Huberman to
save up to $400 off their sleep
493.29 fit holiday bundle, which
includes their new Pod 3 cover.
496.71 Eight Sleep currently
ships in the USA,
498.57 Canada, United Kingdom,
select countries in the EU,
501.42 and Australia.
502.62 Again, that's
eightsleep.com/Huberman.
505.29 And now for my discussion with
Dr. Lex Fridman, welcome back.
510.43 LEX FRIDMAN: It's good
to be back in a bedroom.
513.0 This feels like a porn set.
514.26 I apologize to open that way.
516.46 I've never been in a porn
set, so I should admit this.
518.84 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Our
studio has being renovated.
520.84 So here we are for the
monumental recording
524.52 of episode 100--
525.987 LEX FRIDMAN: Episode
100 of the Huberman Lab
527.82 Podcast, which was inspired
by the Lex Fridman Podcast.
532.032 Some people already
know the story.
533.49 But I'll repeat it again
for those that don't.
536.97 There would not be a
Huberman Lab Podcast,
539.55 were it not for Lex Fridman.
541.05 Because after recording
as a guest on his podcast
545.49 a few years ago, he
made the suggestion
547.17 that I start a podcast.
548.58 And he explained
to me how it works.
550.27 And he said, "You
should start a podcast.
552.81 But just make sure
that it's not you
554.31 blabbing the whole
time, Andrew."
555.75 And I only sort of
followed the advice.
558.27 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
well, you surprised me,
560.55 surprised the world, that
you're able to talk for hours
565.08 and cite some of the
best science going on
567.87 and be able to
give people advice
569.61 without many interruptions
or edits or any of that.
572.52 I mean, that takes an
incredible amount of skill
575.548 that you're probably born with.
576.84 And some of it is developed.
578.22 I mean, the whole science
community is proud of you, man.
581.22 Stanford is proud of you.
583.35 So yeah, it's a beautiful thing.
585.728 It was really surprising.
586.77 Because it's unclear
how a scientist can
589.2 do a great podcast
that's not just
591.408 shooting the shit
about random stuff,
592.95 but really is giving very
structured, good advice
596.25 that's boiling down the
state of the art science
600.15 into something that's
actually useful for people.
602.43 So that was impressive.
603.958 It's like holy shit, he
actually pulled this off.
606.0 And doing it every week
on a different topic--
612.01 I mean, I'm usually
positive, especially
615.19 for people I love and support.
616.81 But damn, I thought,
there's no way
618.448 he's going to be able to pull
this off week after week.
620.74 And it's been only getting
better and better and better.
623.23 Had a whole rant on a recent
podcast, I forget with who,
626.23 of how awesome you are
with Rana el Kaliouby.
629.44 She's a emotion recognition
person, AI person.
633.97 And then she didn't
know who you were.
636.76 And I was like, what
the hell do you mean?
639.563 And I just went on this whole
rant of how awesome you are.
641.98 Is hilarious.
643.6 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm
very gratified to hear this.
646.06 I'm-- it's a little
uncomfortable for me to hear
648.67 but listen, I'm just really
happy if people are getting
652.72 information that they like
and can make actionable.
655.3 And it was inspired by you.
656.89 And look right back at you.
660.34 I've followed a number of
your structural formats.
664.99 Attire, I don't wear a tie.
666.845 I'm constantly reminded
about this by my father.
668.845 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
669.01 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Who says
what-- he'd saw my podcast.
670.7 And he was like, why
don't you dress properly
672.34 like your friend Lex?
673.215 He literally said that.
675.19 And it's a debate that
goes back and forth.
677.51 But nonetheless--
678.77 LEX FRIDMAN: How does it feel?
680.02 Episode 100.
681.22 How does it feel?
682.23 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You know, I think.
682.72 LEX FRIDMAN: Can you
imagine you're here?
684.67 You hear after so many
episodes and done so much.
687.55 I mean, the number of
hours is just insane.
691.065 The amount of
passion, the amount
692.44 of work you put into
this, what's it feel like?
696.67 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It feels great.
698.47 And it feels very much
like the horizon is still
701.86 at the same distance
in front of me.
703.36 Every episode, I just try
and get information there.
706.642 And the process that we
talked about on your podcast.
708.85 We won't go into it of
collecting information,
711.383 distilling it down
to some simple notes,
713.05 walking around,
listening to music,
714.58 trying to figure out
what the motifs are,
717.898 and then-- as just like you,
I don't use a teleprompter
720.19 or anything like that.
721.27 There's very minimal notes.
722.65 So it feels great,
and I love it.
724.52 And again, I'm just grateful
to you for inspiring it.
728.35 And I just want to keep
going and do more of it.
730.79 And I should say
I am also relieved
735.31 that we're sitting here because
you recently went overseas
739.21 to a very intense war zone,
literally, the Ukraine.
745.06 And the entire time
that you were there,
748.3 I was genuinely concerned.
750.16 The world's a unpredictable
place, in general.
753.25 And we don't always get the only
vote and what happens to us.
756.65 So first of all,
welcome back safely,
759.67 one peace, one alive peace.
761.87 And what was that like?
765.21 I mean, at a broad level,
at a specific level,
769.11 what drew you there?
770.4 What surprised you?
771.78 And how do you think it changed
you in coming back here?
776.68 LEX FRIDMAN: I think
there's a lot to say.
778.43 But first, it is
really good to be back.
780.61 One of the things
that when you go
782.59 to a difficult part of the world
or a part of the world that's
785.38 going through
something difficult,
787.27 you really appreciate how
great it is to be an American.
791.83 Everything.
792.64 The easy access to food.
795.67 Despite what people think, the
stable, reliable rule of law.
801.33 The lack of corruption in that
you can trust that if you start
806.91 a business or if you take
on various pursuits in life
810.99 that there's not going to
be at-scale manipulation
814.89 of your efforts such
that you can't succeed.
816.91 So this kind of
capitalism is in it's--
821.73 the ideal of capitalism is
really still burning bright
825.39 in this country.
826.09 And it really makes you
appreciate those aspects.
828.72 And also just the ability to
have a home for generations,
834.87 across generations.
836.11 So you can have your
grandfather live
838.53 in Kentucky in a certain city.
840.3 And then his children lived
there, and you live there,
844.59 and then it just
continues on and on.
846.96 That's the kind of thing you can
have when you don't have war.
850.38 Because war destroys
entire communities.
853.86 And it destroys
histories, generations,
857.97 like life stories that stretch
across the generations.
860.485 So--
860.985 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah.
861.86 I didn't even think about
that until you said just now.
864.152 But photographs, hard drives
get destroyed or just abandoned.
867.51 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
868.26 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries.
870.69 I mean, nowadays, things
exist in the cloud
872.64 but are still a lot of--
874.02 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
874.26 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--material goods
875.635 that are irreplaceable, right.
877.71 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even in rural
parts of the United States,
881.49 they don't exist in
the cloud, right.
883.14 A lot of people still, well,
even in towns, they still
886.62 love the physical photo
album of your family.
890.4 A lot of people still
store their photographs
892.86 of families in the VHS tapes and
all that kind of stuff, yeah.
897.33 But I think-- there's so many
things I've learned and really
903.17 felt the lessons.
904.85 One of which is nobody gives a
damn when your photos are gone
909.44 and all that kind of
stuff, your house is gone.
912.33 The thing time and time
again I saw for people
915.71 that lost everything is how
happy they are for the people.
920.69 They love the friends, the
family that are still alive.
924.44 That's the only thing
they talk about.
926.93 That, in fact, they
don't mention actually
931.16 with much dramatic sort
of vigor about the trauma
935.91 of losing your home.
936.84 They're just non-stop saying
how lucky they are that person X
941.01 person Y is still here.
942.81 And that makes you realize
that when you lose everything,
946.63 it's still--
947.28 it makes you realize
what really matters,
949.45 which is the people
in your life.
951.06 I mean, a lot of people kind
of realize that later in life,
953.52 when you're facing mortality,
when you're facing your death,
956.25 or you get a cancer
diagnosis, that kind of stuff.
959.22 I think people here in
America, in California,
962.64 with the fires, you you
can still lose your home.
966.12 You are going to
realize, like, nah.
967.62 It doesn't really matter.
968.89 It's a pain in the ass
but what matters is still
972.33 the family, the
people, and so on.
975.09 I think the most intense thing--
978.508 I talked to several hundred
people, some of which
980.55 is recorded.
981.54 I've really been
struggling to put that out
985.5 because I have to
edit it myself.
987.58 And so you're talking about 30,
40 hours of footage, and it--
990.81 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is
emotionally struggling?
991.86 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
It is extremely difficult.
992.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you
like emotional struggle?
993.45 LEX FRIDMAN: It's
extremely difficult.
994.81 So I talked to a
lot of politicians.
996.31 The number two in the
country, number three.
998.16 I'll be back there to
talk to the president
1000.05 to do a three-hour conversation.
1002.6 Those are easy to edit.
1003.92 They're really heartfelt
and thoughtful folks
1007.7 from different perspectives
on the geopolitics of the war.
1011.9 But the ones that
really hard to edit
1013.64 is like grandmas that are
in the middle of nowhere.
1016.58 They lost everything.
1017.608 They still have hope,
they still have love.
1019.4 And some of them have--
1021.65 some of them, many of
them, unfortunately,
1023.63 have now hate in their heart.
1025.4 So in February, when
Russia invaded Ukraine,
1031.829 this is the thing I
realized about War.
1034.53 One of the most
painful one lessons
1037.44 is that war creates
generational hate.
1043.339 We sometimes think about war
as a thing that kills people,
1047.359 kills civilians, kills
soldiers, takes away lives,
1050.93 injures people.
1052.16 But we don't
directly think about
1055.1 the secondary and
tertiary effects
1057.23 of that which lasts decades.
1059.91 Which is anyone who's lost
the father or a mother
1063.11 or a daughter or a son,
they now hate not just
1069.52 the individual
soldiers or the leaders
1071.5 that invaded their country but
the entirety of the people.
1075.08 So it's not that they
hate Vladimir Putin
1079.81 or hate the Russian military.
1081.82 They hate Russian people.
1084.48 So that tears the
fabric of a thing
1086.85 that, for me-- my half
my family's from Ukraine,
1092.28 half of my family
is from Russia.
1094.11 But there is--
1095.49 I remember the pain the
triumph of World War two
1101.31 still resonates through
my entire family tree.
1104.94 And so, you remember when
the Russians and Ukrainians
1107.37 fought together against
this Nazi invasion.
1110.4 You remember a lot of that.
1113.05 And now, to see the fabric
of this peoples torn apart
1118.93 completely with hate is really,
really difficult. For me,
1121.69 just to realize that
things will just never
1124.6 be the same on this particular
cultural, historical aspect.
1128.05 But also, there's so many
painful ways in which
1132.85 things will never be the same.
1134.48 Which is we've seen that
it's possible to have
1136.66 a major hot war in
the 21st century.
1141.12 I think a lot of people
are watching this.
1142.87 China is watching this.
1143.95 India is watching this.
1144.92 United States is watching this
and thinking we can actually
1148.81 have a large-scale war.
1151.04 And I think the lessons
learned from that.
1153.8 Might be the kind that lead
to a major World War III
1158.6 in the 21st century.
1160.71 So one of the things I realized
watching the whole scene
1165.765 is that we don't know
shit about what's going
1167.64 to happen in the 21st century.
1169.39 And it might-- we kind of have
this intuition like surely
1172.035 there's not going
to be another war.
1173.535 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like
we'll just coast.
1174.345 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
1175.17 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1176.087 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic.
1177.37 Yeah--
1177.87 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And back to normal.
1178.92 LEX FRIDMAN: Back to normal--
1179.29 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Whatever that is.
1180.707 LEX FRIDMAN: But you
have to remember,
1183.21 at the end of World War I,
as Woodrow Wilson called it,
1187.98 the war to end all wars.
1189.48 Nobody ironically,
in a dark way,
1192.87 it was also the roaring 20s
when people believed this.
1196.02 There will never be
another World War.
1198.3 And 20 years after that,
the rise of Nazi Germany.
1204.51 A charismatic leader
that captivated
1206.4 the minds of
millions and built up
1208.5 a military that can
take on the whole world.
1211.54 And so it makes you realize
that this is still possible.
1215.46 This is still possible.
1216.66 And then the tension.
1218.76 You see this-- the media
machine, the propaganda
1222.72 machine, that I've gotten
to see every aspect of.
1226.37 It's still fueling that division
between America and China.
1231.14 Between Russia and India.
1234.32 And then Africa has
a complicated thing
1237.263 that's trying to figure
out who are they with,
1239.18 who are they against.
1240.29 And just this tension is
building and building.
1243.06 And like it makes you
realize like we might--
1247.07 the thing that might
shake human civilization
1251.69 may not be so far off.
1255.64 That's a realization
you get to really feel.
1259.39 I mean, there's all
kinds of other lessons.
1261.68 And one of which is propaganda.
1263.92 Is I got to--
1265.3 I get a lot of letters, emails.
1266.89 And some of them are full
of really intense language,
1271.36 full of hate from
every side toward me.
1275.65 Or, well, the hate is
towards me as representing
1280.21 side X. And X stands as a
variable for every side.
1286.23 So either I'm a Zelensky
show, or I'm a Putin show,
1290.31 or I'm a NATO show,
or I'm an America--
1295.62 America show--
American empire show.
1298.35 Or I'm a Democrat
or a Republican.
1301.14 Because it's already been,
in this country, politicized.
1304.91 I think there's a sense of
Ukraine is this place that's
1309.2 full of corruption.
1310.32 Why are we sending money there?
1311.66 I think that's kind
of the messaging
1313.7 on the Republican side.
1315.41 On the Democratic side--
1316.89 I'm not even keeping track
of the actual messaging
1320.03 and the conspiracy theories
and the narratives,
1322.91 but they are-- the
tension is there.
1325.16 And I get to feel it directly.
1327.02 And what you get to
really experience
1329.0 is there's a large
number of narratives
1332.75 that all are extremely
confident themselves that they
1336.62 know the truth.
1338.88 People are convinced,
first of all,
1341.3 that they're not being lied to.
1342.89 People in Russia think
there's no propaganda.
1345.95 They think that,
yes, yes, there is
1348.38 like state-sponsored
propaganda, but we're all
1351.08 smart enough to ignore the lame
propaganda that's everywhere.
1357.71 They know that we can think
on our own, we know the truth,
1360.68 and everybody kind of
speaks in this way.
1362.63 Everybody in the
United States says,
1364.56 well, yes, there's
mainstream media,
1366.08 they're full of messaging and
propaganda, but we're smart.
1369.35 We can think on our own.
1370.86 Of course, we see through that.
1372.41 Everybody says this.
1373.94 And then the conclusion
of their thought
1376.13 is often hatred towards some
group, whatever that group is.
1380.51 And the more you've
lost, the more
1382.16 intense the feeling of hatred.
1384.48 It's a really
difficult field to walk
1390.66 through calmly and
with an open mind
1393.42 and try to understand
what's really going on.
1397.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's super intense.
1399.27 That's the only words that
come to mind as I hear this.
1401.85 You mentioned something that
it seems that hate generalizes.
1405.54 It's against an entire
group or an entire country.
1410.86 Why do you think it is that
hate generalizes and that love
1415.26 may or may not generalize?
1417.9 LEX FRIDMAN: I've
had-- sort of one,
1419.4 as you can imagine, the
kind of question I asked
1424.04 is, do you have love
or hate in your heart?
1428.71 It's a question I
asked almost everybody.
1430.8 And then I would dig
into this exact question
1432.93 that you're asking.
1435.74 I think some of the most
beautiful things I've
1438.5 heard which is people
that are full of hate
1440.93 are able to
self-introspect about it.
1443.99 They know they shouldn't feel
it, but they can't help it.
1447.44 It's not-- they know that
ultimately the thing that
1450.56 helps them and helps everyone
is to feel love for fellow man,
1455.21 but they can't help it.
1458.79 They know.
1459.47 It's like a drug, they
say like hate escalates,
1463.7 it's like a vicious spiral.
1465.59 You just can't help it.
1467.43 And the question I
also asked is, do you
1470.3 think you'll ever be
able to forgive Russia?
1473.61 And after much thought almost--
1478.68 it's split, but most
people will say no.
1483.65 I will never be able to forgive.
1485.737 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And because
of the generalization
1487.82 you talked about earlier, that
could even include all Ru--
1490.195 LEX FRIDMAN: All Russians.
1490.47 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
In that statements,
1490.885 they mean all Russians.
1492.05 LEX FRIDMAN: Because
if you do nothing
1499.34 that's as bad or worse
than being part of the army
1506.75 that invades.
1507.78 So the people that are
just sitting there,
1509.75 the good Germans, the people
that are just quietly going
1512.75 on with their lives, you're
just as bad, if not worse,
1516.59 is their perspective.
1518.353 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Earlier, you said
1519.77 that going over
to the Ukraine now
1524.51 allowed you to
realize just so many
1526.85 of the positives of being
here in the United States.
1530.15 I have a good friend.
1531.422 We both know him.
1532.13 I won't name him
by name, but we've
1533.96 communicated the
three of us from
1536.24 tier-one Special Operations.
1537.71 He spent years
doing deployments.
1539.6 Really amazing individual.
1541.46 And I remember when the pandemic
hit, he said on a text thread
1546.83 you know, Americans aren't used
to the government interfering
1549.74 with their plans.
1550.82 Around the world,
many people are
1553.34 familiar with governments
dramatically interfering
1556.352 with their plans.
1557.06 Sometimes even in a
seemingly random way.
1559.76 Here we were not
braced for that.
1562.88 I mean, we get speeding
tickets, and there's lines
1566.69 to vote and things like that.
1567.93 But I think the pandemic
was one of the first times,
1570.477 at least in my life, that I
can remember where it really
1572.81 seemed like the government was
impeding what people naturally
1575.75 wanted to do.
1576.8 And that was a shock
for people here.
1579.71 And I have a what might
seem like a somewhat
1583.58 mundane question,
but it's something
1585.08 that I saw on social media.
1586.22 A lot of people were
asking me to ask you,
1589.49 and I was curious about too.
1591.92 What was a typical
day like over there?
1594.17 Were sleeping in a bed, were
you sleeping on the ground?
1597.648 Everyone seems to want to know.
1598.94 What were you eating?
1599.66 Were you eating once a day?
1600.785 Were you eating your steak?
1602.09 Or were you-- were you in fairly
deprived conditions over there?
1605.63 I saw a couple photos
that you posted out
1610.55 of doors in front of rubble.
1613.55 With pith helmet on in one case.
1615.08 What was that typical
day like over there?
1620.87 LEX FRIDMAN: So
there's two modes.
1623.25 One of them-- I spent
a lot of time in Kyiv,
1626.21 which is much safer than--
1631.785 it may be obvious to state
but for people who don't know,
1634.16 it's in the middle
of the country,
1635.577 and it's much safer
than the actual front.
1638.38 The word the battle
is happening.
1640.07 So much, much safer
than Kyiv even
1642.92 is Lviv which is the
Western part of the country.
1645.63 So the times I
spent in Kyiv were
1647.48 fundamentally different than
the time I spent at the front.
1650.25 And I went to the
Kherson region,
1652.86 which is where a lot of really
heated battle was happening.
1655.983 There's several areas.
1656.9 So there's Kharkiv.
1658.61 It's in the Northeast
of the country.
1660.71 And then there's Donbas region,
which is East of the country.
1663.86 And then there's Kherson
region, which, by the way,
1667.37 I'm not good at geography, so
is the Southeast of the country.
1672.587 And that's where, at
least when I was there,
1674.42 was a lot of really
heated fighting happening.
1677.1 So when I was in
the Kherson region,
1679.37 it's what you would imagine.
1684.37 The place-- I stayed in a
hotel where all the lights
1687.22 have to stay off.
1688.54 So the entire town,
all the lights are off.
1691.72 You have to navigate
through the darkness
1693.79 and use your phone
to shine, and so on.
1695.715 ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is
terrible for the circadian
1697.84 system.
1698.32 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1698.71 LEX FRIDMAN: That's exactly--
1699.35 I was this-- how can I do this?
1700.96 Where's my element
and Athletic Greens?
1703.21 How can I function?
1704.44 No.
1706.87 There's I think it was balanced
by the deep appreciation
1711.09 of being alive.
1711.715 [LAUGHTER]
1712.49 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Right now I-- mean,
1713.99 this is the reason
that I asked--
1715.05 LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise.
1715.33 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This is the reason
1716.788 I ask is we get used to all
these creature comforts.
1719.362 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
1720.07 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
we don't need them,
1723.31 but we often come
to depend on them
1725.41 in a way that makes us
feel like we need them.
1727.66 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
but very quickly,
1729.61 there's something about
the intensity of life
1734.965 that you see in people's
eyes because they're
1736.84 living through a war that makes
you forget all those creature
1739.06 comforts.
1739.87 And it was actually--
1741.94 I'm somebody who hates
traveling and so on.
1743.92 I love the creature habits.
1745.93 I love-- I love the
comfort of the ritual right
1750.07 but all of that was
forgotten very quickly.
1752.23 Just the intensity of
feeling, the intensity of
1754.9 love that people have for
each other, that was obvious.
1758.29 In terms of food--
1759.35 so there's a curfew.
1761.41 So depends on what
part of the country.
1764.53 But usually, you basically have
to scamper home like 9:00 PM.
1768.88 So the hard curfew in a lot of
places is 11:00 PM at night.
1774.07 But by then, you
have to be home.
1777.67 So-- in some places, it's 10:00.
1780.32 So at 9:00 PM, you
start going home.
1783.05 Which, for me, was
kind of wonderful
1785.44 also because I get to spend--
1789.31 I get to be forced to spend time
alone and think for many hours
1795.28 in wherever I'm staying.
1797.14 Which is really nice.
1798.1 And everywhere there's a
calmness and the quietness
1800.225 to the whole thing.
1801.16 In terms of food, once a day.
1804.43 Just the food is incredibly
cheap and incredibly delicious.
1810.05 People are still--
one of the things
1811.73 they can still take pride
in is making the best
1816.8 possible food they can.
1818.18 So meat-- but they do
admire American meat,
1822.712 so the meat is not as great as
it could be in that country.
1825.17 But I ate borsch every day,
all that kind of stuff.
1828.35 Mostly meat.
1830.21 So spend the entire day--
1832.49 wake up in the
morning with coffee,
1834.53 spend the entire day
talking to people.
1836.52 Which for me is very
difficult because
1839.63 of the intensity of the story.
1840.88 It's one after the
other after the other.
1842.69 We just talk to regular
people, talk to soldiers,
1845.14 talk to politicians,
all kinds of soldiers.
1849.85 I talked to people there who
are doing rescue missions, so
1853.69 Americans.
1855.295 I hung out with Tim Kennedy.
1857.887 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah?
1858.97 The great Tim Kennedy.
1860.26 LEX FRIDMAN: The great
Tim Kennedy, who--
1863.53 also him and many
others revealed to me
1868.78 one of the many
reasons I'm proud to be
1870.85 an American is how trained
and skilled and effective
1878.23 American soldiers are.
1879.64 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I guess for
listeners of this podcast maybe
1881.56 we should familiarize
them with who
1882.97 Tim Kennedy is because I
realized that a number of them
1885.1 will know, but--
1885.55 LEX FRIDMAN: How do you do that?
1886.883 How do you try to
summarize a man?
1888.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
1891.34 We can be accurate
but not exhaustive,
1893.38 as any good data are
accurate but not exhaustive.
1898.15 Very skilled and accomplished
MMA fighter, very skilled
1900.88 and accomplished former
Special Operations member,
1904.75 American Patriot, and
podcaster too, right?
1907.87 Does he have his own podcast?
1909.49 LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe.
1910.45 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe.
1911.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We know Andy
Stumpf has his own podcast.
1913.18 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1913.66 LEX FRIDMAN: Which is
an amazing podcast.
1914.74 Yeah, Andy's great.
1915.55 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1916.9 Clearing Hot podcast
with Andy Stumpf.
1918.7 LEX FRIDMAN: But
also Tim Kennedy
1920.075 is like the embodiment of
America to the most beautiful
1923.95 and the most ridiculous degree.
1925.54 So he's like what you imagine--
1930.03 what is it, Team America?
1933.9 I just imagine him
shirtless on a tank rolling
1936.96 into enemy territory
just screaming
1938.96 at the top of his lungs.
1939.96 That's just his personality.
1941.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
But not posturing.
1943.015 He actually does the
work, as they say.
1944.64 LEX FRIDMAN: So
this is the thing.
1946.057 He really embodies that.
1947.73 Now, some of that is just
his personality and humor.
1951.03 I'd like to sort of comment
on the humor of things,
1953.22 not just with him.
1954.33 There's very one other
interesting thing I've learned.
1956.67 But also when he's
actually helping people
1959.52 he's extremely good
at what he does,
1961.78 which is building
teams that rescue, that
1964.59 go into the most dangerous areas
of Ukraine, dangerous areas
1968.64 anywhere else, and
they get the job done.
1970.96 And one of the things I
heard time and time again,
1974.68 which what's really
interesting to me,
1977.6 that Ukrainian soldiers said
that comparing Ukrainian,
1982.84 Russian, and American
soldiers, American soldiers
1986.05 are the bravest, which was
very interesting for me
1989.14 to hear given how
high the morale is
1990.91 for the Ukrainian soldiers.
1992.26 But that just
reveals that training
1994.54 enables you to be brave.
1997.31 So it's not just about how well
trained they are and so on,
2000.18 it's how intense and ferocious
they are in the fighting.
2003.3 And it makes you realize,
this is American army,
2006.9 not just through the technology,
especially the special force
2010.99 guys.
2011.49 They're still one of
the most effective
2014.46 and terrifying
armies in the world.
2016.66 And listen, just
for context, I'm
2019.11 somebody who is, for the most
part, anti-war, a pacifist.
2024.25 But you get to see some of the
realities of war kind of wake
2029.81 you up to what needs to get
done to protect sovereignty,
2035.87 to protect some of the values,
to protect civilians and homes
2040.645 and all that kind of stuff.
2041.77 Sometimes war has to happen.
2044.43 And I should also
mention the Russian side
2046.18 because while I haven't gotten
to experience the Russian side
2051.3 yet I do fully plan to travel to
Russia, as I've told everybody.
2055.469 I was very upfront with
everybody about this.
2058.87 I would like to hear
the story of Russians.
2061.139 But I do know from the Ukrainian
side, like the grandmas--
2064.71 I love grandmas.
2065.969 They told me stories that
the Russians really--
2068.699 the ones that entered their
villages, they really, really
2072.87 believed they're saving
Ukraine from Nazis,
2075.21 from Nazi occupation.
2077.38 So they feel that
Ukraine is under control
2082.44 of Nazi organizations
and they believe
2085.65 they're saving
the country that's
2087.319 their brothers and sisters.
2092.1 I think propaganda and I think
truth is a very difficult thing
2099.51 to arrive with in that war zone.
2101.53 I think in the 21st
century one of the things
2103.56 you realize that so much of war,
even more so than in the past,
2107.64 is an information war.
2109.68 And people that just use Twitter
for their source of information
2114.12 might be surprised to know
how much misinformation there
2117.54 is on Twitter, like real
narratives being sold,
2121.95 and so it's really hard
to know who to believe.
2125.04 And through all of that you
have to try to keep an open mind
2128.76 and ultimately
ignore the powerful
2132.33 and listen to actual
citizens, actual people.
2135.03 That's the other
maybe obvious lesson
2137.4 is that war is waged by
powerful, rich people,
2143.9 and it's the poor
people that suffer.
2146.76 And that's just visible
time and time again.
2150.41 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned
the fact that people still
2153.29 enjoy food or the
pleasure of cooking,
2155.27 or there's occasional humor
or maybe frequent humor.
2158.9 I know Jocko Willink has
talked about this in warfare
2161.87 in that all the elements of
the human spirit and condition
2166.01 still emerge at various times.
2169.513 I find this amazing,
and you and I
2170.93 have had conversations
about this before,
2172.638 but the aperture of the mind.
2176.288 The classic story
that comes to mind
2178.13 is the one of Viktor
Frankl or Nelson Mandela.
2181.25 You put somebody into a
small box of confinement
2183.98 and some people break
under those conditions
2187.94 and other people
find entire stories
2191.36 within a centimeter
of concrete that
2194.75 can occupy them, real stories
and richness or humor or love
2200.12 or fascination and surprise.
2202.13 And I find this so interesting
that the mind is so adaptable.
2205.002 We talked about creature
comforts and then lack
2206.96 of creature comforts and
the way that we can adapt,
2210.32 and yet, humans are
always striving,
2212.42 it seems, or one would hope,
for these better conditions
2215.12 to better their conditions.
2217.05 So as you've come back--
2219.11 and you've been here
now back in the States
2221.48 for how long after your trip?
2223.14 LEX FRIDMAN: Depends
on this podcast
2224.64 release but it felt
like I've never
2227.27 left, so practically
speaking, a couple months.
2231.297 ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
2232.13 Yeah.
2232.49 And we won't be shy.
2233.37 We're recording
this mid-September.
2235.91 LEX FRIDMAN: We actually
recorded this several years ago
2238.5 so we're anticipating
in the future.
2240.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This is where we're
2241.5 going to start telling you this
is a simulation, you and Joe.
2244.1 I'm still trying to figure
out what that actually means.
2247.58 I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge
2249.8 one of our sponsors,
Athletic Greens.
2251.99 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
is a vitamin mineral probiotic
2256.31 drink that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
2259.64 I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012
2262.4 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2264.68 The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason
2267.097 I still take Athletic Greens,
once or usually twice a day,
2270.17 is that it gets
me the probiotics
2272.27 that I need for gut health.
2273.92 Our gut is very important.
2275.06 It's populated by
gut microbiota that
2277.57 communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically
2280.07 all the biological
systems of our body
2281.78 to strongly impact our
immediate and long term health,
2285.32 and those probiotics
in Athletic Greens
2287.27 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
2291.03 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains
2292.67 a number of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals
2294.59 that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs
2297.2 are met, and it tastes great.
2299.832 If you'd like to try
Athletic Greens you can go
2301.79 to athleticgreens.com/huberman
and they'll give you five free
2306.05 travel packs that make it really
easy to mix up Athletic Greens
2308.867 while you're on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera,
2311.45 and they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3, K2.
2315.05 Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman
2317.66 to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply
2320.24 of vitamin D3, K2.
2321.932 I know I speak for
many people when
2323.39 I say that we are very
happy that you're back.
2325.91 We know that it's not going
to be the first and last trip,
2328.79 that there will be
others, and that you'll
2331.1 be going to Russia as well
and presumably other places
2333.62 as well in order to explore.
2336.51 And I have to say, as a
podcaster and as your friend,
2340.25 I was really inspired at
your sense of adventure
2344.45 and your sense of
not just adventure,
2347.648 but thoughtful,
respectful adventure.
2349.19 You understood what
you were doing.
2350.6 You weren't just going there
to get some wartime footage
2352.82 or something.
2353.362 This wasn't a kick or a thrill.
2355.22 This is really serious
and remains serious.
2358.22 So thank you for doing it,
and please, next time you go,
2363.38 bring Tim Kennedy again.
2367.01 LEX FRIDMAN: I feel like
Tim Kennedy gets you into--
2369.368 will take you because
he really loves
2370.91 going to the most dangerous
places and helping people.
2373.47 So I think he'd get me into
more trouble than it's worth.
2376.32 And I should mention
that, I mean,
2379.82 there's many reasons I
went, but it's definitely
2382.01 not something I take
lightly or want to do again.
2384.532 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
2385.49 LEX FRIDMAN: So I'm doing
things that I don't want to do,
2387.89 I just feel like I have to.
2389.27 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You're compelled.
2390.02 LEX FRIDMAN: So I
don't think there's--
2391.73 now I'll definitely talk
about it, as we all should.
2394.43 There's different
areas of the world that
2396.17 are seeing a lot of suffering.
2397.68 Yemen.
2399.995 There's so many atrocities
going on in the world today,
2403.2 but this one is just
personal to me so I want to--
2408.09 I feel like I'm qualified
just because of the language.
2410.43 So most of the talking,
by the way, I was doing,
2412.89 it was in Russian.
2414.51 And so because of the language,
because of my history,
2418.24 I felt like I had to do
this particular thing.
2420.75 I think it's, in many ways,
stupid and dangerous, and that
2424.71 was made clear to me.
2427.14 But I do many things
of this nature
2428.82 because the heart
pulls towards that.
2433.05 But also there's
a freedom to not--
2437.51 I'm afraid of death, but I
think there's a freedom to--
2443.27 it's almost like,
OK, if I die, I
2446.42 want to take full advantage of
not having a family currently.
2450.65 I feel like when you
have a family there's
2452.81 a responsibility for others
so you immediately become
2456.5 more conservative and careful.
2458.09 I feel like I want to
take full advantage
2460.22 of this particular
moment in my life
2461.81 when you can be a little
bit more accepting of risk.
2465.377 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
you should definitely
2467.21 reproduce at some point.
2469.01 Maybe before next time you
should just freeze some sperm.
2472.67 LEX FRIDMAN: I--
2473.6 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that--
2474.32 LEX FRIDMAN: Is that what
you do with ice baths?
2475.55 Is how that works?
2476.36 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
know, it's interesting.
2477.32 There's always an opportunity
to do some science protocols.
2480.47 You know that there are
products on the internet,
2482.57 and there are actually a few
decent manuscripts looking
2485.63 at how cold exposure can
increase testosterone levels,
2489.83 but it doesn't happen
by the cold directly.
2493.38 Good scientists, as the authors
of those papers, were and are,
2497.18 realized that it's the
vasoconstriction and then
2500.09 the vasodilation.
2502.715 As people warm up again
there's increased blood flow
2505.22 to the testicles,
and in women it
2506.848 seems there's probably
increased blood flow
2508.64 to the reproductive organs as
well after people warm back up.
2512.06 So that seems to cause some
sort of hyper nourishment
2515.45 of the various cells, the
Sertoli and Leydig cells
2519.53 of the testes that
lead to increased
2521.33 output of testosterone and in
women testosterone as well.
2525.12 So the cold exposure in
any case is obviously a--
2530.21 do you do the ice bath?
2531.17 Are you into that?
2531.68 LEX FRIDMAN: I've
not done that yet.
2532.31 ANDREW HUBERMAN: As a
Russian you probably consider
2534.435 that a hot tub.
2535.07 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly.
2536.81 Yeah.
2537.47 It's a nice thing to have fun
with every once in a while
2541.19 to warm up.
2541.91 No, I haven't done that.
2543.227 Been kind of waiting
to maybe do it together
2545.06 with you at some point.
2545.99 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
2546.33 LEX FRIDMAN: Because
we have a guide.
2547.872 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
We have one here.
2549.288 It'll be
straightforward for you.
2550.74 I always say that the
adrenaline comes in waves,
2552.74 and so if you just
think about it walls,
2554.21 like you're going through a
number of walls of adrenaline
2556.01 as opposed to going for time,
it becomes rather trivial.
2558.518 With your jujitsu
background and what
2560.06 you'll immediately recognize
the physiological sensation.
2562.97 Even though it's
cold specifically,
2565.093 it's the adrenaline
that makes you
2566.51 want to hop out of the thing.
2567.718 LEX FRIDMAN: And
you've seen Joe's.
2569.3 So Joe set up a
really nice man cave--
2573.29 or it's not even a cave
because it's so big.
2575.82 It's like a network
of man caves.
2578.42 But it has a ice bath and
a sauna next to each other.
2582.425 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one of
those here, ice bath and sauna.
2585.05 So we'll have to get you
in it one of these days.
2587.245 LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble.
2588.62 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe
tonight, maybe tomorrow.
2590.578 No, although there is a--
2592.475 I don't know the underlying
physiological basis
2594.86 but there does seem to
be a trend toward truth
2597.65 telling in the sauna.
2599.6 Some people will refer
to them as truth barrels.
2601.618 Mine's a barrel sauna
shaped like a barrel.
2603.41 Who knows why?
2604.01 Maybe under intense
heat duress people just
2606.86 feel compelled to share.
2608.06 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I have
a complicated relationship
2610.227 with saunas because of
all the weight cutting.
2612.74 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
2613.64 LEX FRIDMAN: Some of
the deepest suffering--
2614.81 sorry to interrupt--
2615.65 I've done was in the sauna.
2617.615 It's very-- I mean, I've gone
to some dark places in a sauna
2621.08 because, I mean, I wrestled
my whole life, judo, jujitsu,
2625.16 and those weights cuts
can really test the mind.
2629.24 So you're-- truth telling.
2632.323 Yeah, it's a certain
kind of truth
2633.74 telling because
you're sitting there
2635.24 and the clock moves slower than
it has ever moved in your life.
2640.2 Yeah.
2640.7 So I usually, for
the most part, I
2642.58 would try to have a bunch of
sweats, garbage bags, and all
2646.88 that kind of stuff, and run.
2648.45 It's easier because you
can distract the mind.
2650.57 In the sauna you can't
distract the mind.
2652.52 It's just and all the excuses
and all the weaknesses
2657.47 in your mind just
coming to the surface,
2659.18 and you're just sitting there
and sweating-- or not sweating.
2662.03 That's the worst.
2662.87 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And talk
about visual aperture.
2664.28 You're in a small box so it also
inspires some claustrophobia
2667.1 even if you're not
claustrophobic.
2669.71 That's absolutely true.
2671.28 And the desire to just
get out of the thing
2674.3 is where you get a pretty
serious adrenaline surge
2677.33 from in the sauna as well.
2679.79 Now, the sauna actually will--
2681.98 it won't deplete testosterone
but it kills sperm.
2684.44 So for people that--
2686.24 sperm are on a 60
day sperm cycle
2687.93 so if you're trying
to donate sperm--
2689.835 because that's what
got us on to this--
2691.46 or fertilize an egg or
eggs in whatever format,
2695.69 dish or in vivo, as we say
in science, which means--
2698.66 well, you can look it up, folks.
2702.89 The 60 day sperm cycle.
2704.1 So if you go into
a really hot sauna
2706.67 or a hot bath or a
hot tub, in 60 days
2709.94 those sperm are going to be--
2711.165 a significantly
greater portion of them
2712.79 will be dead, will
be non-viable.
2714.83 So there's a simple solution.
2716.21 People just put ice pack down
there or a jar, not this jar,
2721.61 but a jar of cold fluid between
their legs and just sit there,
2725.302 or they go back and
forth between the ice
2727.01 bath and the sauna.
2727.94 But you probably-- if you're
going to go back over there
2730.89 you should freeze sperm.
2732.722 We're going to do a couple
episodes on fertility when
2734.93 it's relatively inexpensive.
2736.55 And you're young so
you probably do it now
2738.42 because there is a association
with autism as males get older.
2742.8 It's not a strong one.
2743.88 It's significant but it's
still a small contribution
2746.31 to the autism phenotype.
2747.42 LEX FRIDMAN: As you age
don't sperm get wiser or no?
2750.63 There's no science to back that?
2751.98 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but men
can conceive healthy children
2754.64 at a considerable age.
2755.97 But in any case--
2758.19 but no, they don't get wiser.
2760.192 What happens is interesting--
2761.4 LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak.
2762.21 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it's a
little bit like the maturation
2764.4 of the brain in the sense
that some of the sperm
2766.4 get much better at swimming
and then many of them
2769.02 get less good.
2770.07 Motility is a strong correlate
of the DNA of the sperm.
2773.02 LEX FRIDMAN: This is
probably a good time
2774.728 to announce that I'm
selling my sperm as an NFTs.
2777.9 I wanted to see how much that--
2779.31 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness.
2780.18 LEX FRIDMAN: Riding
the crypto wave.
2781.17 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, your
children, your future children
2783.587 and my future children, are
supposed to do jujitsu together
2786.27 since I've only done
the one jujitsu class
2788.16 so I'm strongly vested
in you having children.
2791.82 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
2792.84 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But only
in the friendly kind of way.
2796.02 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes.
2797.315 Friendly competition
kind of way.
2798.69 Yeah.
2799.38 Dominance of the clan.
2800.98 Yep.
2802.8 For sure.
2804.91 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving
on to science, but still
2809.1 with our minds in the Ukraine.
2811.26 Did you encounter any scientists
or see any universities?
2816.08 As we know, in this country
and in Europe and elsewhere,
2819.9 science takes infrastructure.
2821.97 You need buildings, you need
laboratories, you need robots,
2824.61 you need a lot of equipment,
and you need minus 80 freezers
2829.68 and you need incubators
and you need money
2832.08 and you need technicians.
2833.37 And typically it's been
the wealthier countries
2835.65 that have been able to
do more research for sake
2838.38 of research and development
and prioritization.
2842.64 Certainly the Ukraine had
some marvelous universities
2845.25 and marvelous scientists.
2848.44 What's going on with science
and scientists over there?
2852.93 And gosh, can we even
calculate the loss of discovery
2857.1 that is occurring as a
consequence of this conflict?
2860.5 LEX FRIDMAN: So science goes on.
2864.54 Before the war Ukraine had
a very vibrant tech sector,
2868.02 which means engineering
and all that kind of stuff,
2871.44 and Kyiv has a lot of
excellent universities
2873.39 and they still go on.
2875.07 The biggest hit, I
would say, is not
2878.34 the infrastructure
of the science,
2879.76 but the fact, because
of the high morale,
2882.91 everybody is joining
the military.
2885.4 So everybody is
going to the front
2886.87 to fight, including you, Andrew
Huberman, would be fighting,
2891.04 and not because you have
to but because you want to.
2894.1 And everybody you know
would be really proud
2895.96 that you're fighting,
even though everyone tries
2899.08 to convince, Andrew
Huberman, you
2901.48 have much better
ways to contribute.
2904.7 There's deep honor in fighting
for your country, yes,
2906.97 but there are better ways to
contribute to your country
2910.36 than just picking up a gun that
you're not that trained with
2914.08 and going to the front.
2915.31 Still, they do it.
2917.65 Scientists, engineers,
CEOs, professors, students--
2923.078 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men and women?
2924.37 LEX FRIDMAN: Actors--
men and women.
2926.29 Obviously, primarily
men, but men and women.
2930.91 Much more than you would
see in other militaries,
2933.64 women are-- everybody.
2935.11 Everybody wants to fight.
2936.31 Everybody's proud of fighting.
2937.81 There's no discussion
of pacifism.
2942.93 Should we be fighting?
2944.09 Is this right?
2944.99 Is this-- everybody's
really proud of fighting.
2950.09 So there's this
kind of black hole
2951.53 that pulls everything,
all the resources,
2953.99 into the war effort that's
not just financial but also
2958.07 psychological.
2959.06 So it's like if you're a
scientist it feels like what--
2964.48 it feels almost like
you're dishonoring humanity
2972.1 by continuing to do things
you were doing before.
2975.73 There's a lot of people that
converted to being soldiers.
2978.16 They literally watch
a YouTube video
2980.89 of how to shoot
a particular gun,
2983.21 how to arm a drone
with a grenade.
2986.02 If you're a tech
person you know how
2988.0 to work with drones so
you're going to use that,
2990.31 use whatever skills you got,
figure out whatever skills
2993.4 you got and how to use them to
help the effort on the front.
2997.21 And so that's a big hit.
2999.16 But that said, I've talked
to a lot of folks in Kyiv--
3002.7 faculty primarily in the
tech economics space,
3006.39 so I didn't get a chance
to interact with folks who
3008.82 are on the biology, chemistry,
neuroscience side of things,
3013.74 but that still goes on.
3015.13 So one of the really
impressive things about Ukraine
3018.51 is that they're able to maintain
infrastructure like road, food
3022.35 supply, all that kind of stuff,
education, while the war is
3027.06 going on, especially in Kyiv.
3028.74 The war started
where nobody knew
3032.07 whether Kyiv was going to be
taken by the Russian forces.
3034.87 It was surrounded.
3036.78 And a lot of experts from
outside were convinced that
3042.77 Russia would take
Kyiv, and they didn't.
3045.66 And one of the really
impressive things as a leader--
3049.047 one of the things I
really experienced
3050.63 is that a lot of people
criticized Zelenskyy
3053.33 before the war.
3054.86 He only had about
30% approval rate.
3057.14 A lot of people
didn't like Zelenskyy.
3059.51 But one of the
great things he did
3062.96 as a leader, which I'm not
sure many leaders would
3065.66 be able to do, is when Kyiv
was clearly being invaded he
3071.06 chose to stay.
3073.04 He stayed in the capital.
3074.33 Everybody, all the American
military, the intelligence
3079.43 agencies, NATO, his own staff,
advisors all told him to flee,
3084.17 and he stayed.
3085.44 And so I think that was a
beacon, a symbol for the rest,
3090.073 for the universities,
for science,
3091.49 for the infrastructure
that we're staying too,
3094.61 and that kept the
whole thing going.
3097.82 There's an interesting social
experiment that happened,
3101.97 I think for folks who
are interested in gun
3104.04 control in this
country in particular,
3106.33 is one of the decisions
they made early on
3110.34 is to give guns to everybody.
3113.35 Semi-automatics.
3114.37 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Early on in the war?
3115.51 LEX FRIDMAN: Early
on in the war, yeah.
3117.135 So everybody got a gun.
3119.24 They also released
a bunch of prisoners
3120.91 from prison because
there was no staff
3123.94 to keep the prisons running.
3129.11 And so there's a
very interesting
3131.99 psychological experiment of,
like, how is this going to go?
3135.89 Everybody has a gun.
3137.385 Are they going to
start robbing places?
3139.01 Are they going to
start taking advantage
3140.677 of a chaotic situation?
3141.95 And what happened is
that crime went to zero.
3146.48 So it turned out that
this, as an experiment,
3149.54 worked wonderfully.
3150.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a
case where love generalized.
3152.96 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
3153.47 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or
at least hate did not.
3154.79 We don't know if it's
love or it's sort of lack
3156.8 of initiative for common
culture directed hate.
3160.07 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
3160.82 I don't-- right.
3163.28 I think that's very correct
to say that it wasn't
3166.52 hate that was unifying people.
3168.35 It was love of country,
love of community.
3170.93 It's probably the same thing
that will happen to humans when
3173.84 aliens invade as well.
3176.57 It's the common effort.
3177.89 Everybody puts everything
else to the side.
3180.35 Plus just the sheer amount
of guns is similar to Texas.
3184.88 You realize, well,
there's going to be
3187.76 a self-correcting mechanism very
quickly because the rule of law
3191.3 was also put aside, right?
3194.68 Basically the police
force lost a lot of power
3198.4 because everybody else
has guns and they're
3200.23 kind of taking the law
into their own hands.
3203.14 That system, at least
in this particular case
3205.78 in this particular moment
in human history, worked.
3209.71 It's an interesting
lesson, you know?
3212.952 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is.
3213.91 I had an interesting contrast
that I'll share with you
3216.97 because you mentioned Texas.
3218.2 So not so long ago
I was in Austin.
3220.195 I often visit you or others
in Austin, as you know.
3222.97 And many doors that I walked
past, including a school,
3226.84 said no firearms
past this point.
3230.312 It was a sticker on the door.
3231.52 You see this on
hospitals sometimes.
3233.08 I saw this at Baylor College
of Medicine, et cetera.
3236.56 Relatively common
to see in Texas,
3239.11 not so common in California.
3241.69 And then I flew to the
San Francisco Bay Area,
3244.81 was walking by an elementary
school in my old neighborhood,
3248.41 and saw a similar
sticker and looked at it
3250.3 and it said, no peanuts
or other allergy
3254.83 containing foods past
this point on the door
3257.407 of this elementary school.
3258.49 So quite a different
contrast, guns and peanuts.
3261.94 Now, peanut allergies,
obviously, are very serious
3264.37 for some people, although
there's great research out
3266.537 of Stanford showing that
early exposure to peanuts
3269.47 can prevent the allergies.
3271.45 But don't start rubbing yourself
in peanut butter, folks,
3274.0 if you have a peanut allergy.
3274.99 That's not the best
way to deal with it.
3276.657 In any case, the
contrast of what's
3278.35 dangerous, the contrast of
the familiarity with guns
3284.71 versus no familiarity.
3286.09 In Israel and elsewhere you see
machine guns in the airport.
3289.78 In Germany, Frankfurt, you see
machine guns in the airport.
3292.54 Not so common in
the United States.
3294.91 So again, I feel like there's
this aperture of vision.
3298.0 There's this aperture of
pleasures versus creature
3301.57 comforts and lack of
creature comforts,
3304.12 and then there's this
aperture of danger, right?
3307.695 People who are
familiar with guns
3309.07 are familiar with people
coming in and setting
3310.987 their firearm on the table
and eating dinner, you know?
3313.54 But if you're not accustomed
to that it's jarring, right?
3317.63 LEX FRIDMAN: I should mention--
3319.09 people know this
throughout human history--
3321.22 but the human ability
to get assimilated now,
3327.76 get used to violence
is incredible.
3331.49 So you could be living
in a peaceful time,
3334.57 like we're here now, and
there would be one explosion,
3338.38 like a 9/11 type of situation.
3340.18 That would be a huge shock.
3341.44 It's terrifying.
3342.19 Everybody freaks out.
3343.31 The second one is a huge drop
off in how freaked out you get.
3347.23 And in a matter of
days, sometimes hours,
3350.65 it becomes the normal.
3352.33 I've talked to so many
people in Kharkiv,
3354.79 which is one of the towns that's
seen a lot of heated battle.
3358.93 You ask them, is it safe there?
3361.772 In fact, when I went to the--
3365.51 closer and closer to the
war zone you ask people,
3367.58 is it safe?
3369.22 And their answer's usually,
yeah, it's pretty safe.
3372.53 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
all signal to noise.
3375.79 LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody has told
me except Western reporters
3379.96 sitting in the West
Side of Ukraine,
3381.91 it's really dangerous here.
3383.95 Everyone's like,
yeah, it's good.
3387.46 My uncle just died yesterday.
3390.1 He was shot.
3392.2 But it's pretty good.
3394.09 The farm is still running.
3397.246 How do I put it?
3398.95 They focus on the
positive, that's one.
3400.72 But there's a
deeper truth there,
3402.86 which is just get used
to difficult situations
3406.065 and the stuff that
make you happy
3407.44 and the stuff that
make you upset
3409.36 is relative to that new
normal that you establish.
3411.733 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I grew up in California
3413.65 and there were a
lot of earthquakes.
3414.73 I remember the '89
quake, I remember
3416.35 the Embarcadero
Freeway pancaking
3418.06 on top of people and cars.
3419.56 I remember I moved to
Southern California,
3421.562 there was a Northridge quake.
3422.77 Wherever I move there
seem to be earthquakes.
3424.645 I never worry about
earthquakes, ever.
3426.28 I just don't.
3427.06 In fact, I don't
like the destruction
3429.07 they cause, but every once
in a while an earthquake will
3430.9 roll through and it's
kind of exciting.
3432.07 It sounds like a
train coming through.
3433.12 It's like, wow, like
the Earth is moving.
3434.71 You know?
3435.21 Again, I don't want
anyone to get harmed,
3436.93 but I enjoy a good rumble
coming through nonetheless.
3442.51 It's signal to noise.
3443.57 But if I saw a
tornado I'd freak out,
3446.082 and people from the Midwest
are probably comfortable with--
3448.54 Dan Gable, the great
wrestler from the Midwest
3450.325 that you know and I've
never met but I have
3451.87 great respect for, he's
probably-- sees a tornado
3454.0 and is like, ah, yeah.
3454.78 Maybe.
3455.14 Yeah.
3455.68 You know?
3456.46 So I think signal
to noise is real.
3460.73 Before I neglect,
although I won't
3463.25 forget, speaking of signal
to noise and environment,
3467.69 you are returning
to or have gone back
3470.48 to one of your original
natural habitats,
3474.11 which is the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology which
3477.98 is--
3478.48 LEX FRIDMAN: Natural
habitat, yeah.
3479.21 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's actually
difficult to pronounce in full.
3480.98 MIT, right?
3482.06 So you've been spending some
time there teaching and doing
3485.808 other things.
3486.35 Tell us what you're up
to with MIT recently.
3488.39 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I'm
really glad that you,
3491.06 being on the West Coast, know
the difference between Boston,
3493.74 New York.
3494.24 I feel like a lot of people
think it's like the East Coast.
3497.04 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
very different, especially
3499.04 the Bostonians and New Yorkers.
3500.397 LEX FRIDMAN: They
get very aggressive.
3501.98 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness.
3502.67 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I love it.
3504.47 I gave lectures there in
front of a in person crowd.
3508.385 ANDREW HUBERMAN: What
were you talking about?
3510.26 LEX FRIDMAN: For the
AI, so different aspects
3512.18 of AI and robotics, machine
learning-- machine learning.
3517.26 So for people who know the
artificial intelligence field
3520.1 they usually don't
use the term AI,
3521.57 and people from outside AIs.
3523.7 The biggest breakthroughs
in the machine
3525.77 learning field with some
discussion of robotics
3529.37 and so on.
3530.4 Yeah.
3530.9 It was in person.
3531.77 It was wonderful.
3533.55 I'm a sucker for that.
3534.5 I really avoided teaching
or any kind of interaction
3538.28 during COVID because people
put a lot of emphasis
3543.17 on but also got comfortable
with remote teaching,
3545.81 and I think nobody enjoyed it.
3548.51 Except there's a notion
that it's much easier to
3553.54 do because you don't
have to travel.
3558.52 You can do it in your
pajamas kind of thing.
3560.87 But when you actually
get to do it,
3563.08 you don't get the
same kind of joy
3565.72 that you do when
you're teaching.
3567.34 As a student you don't get the
same kind of joy of learning.
3570.528 It's not as effective and
all that kind of stuff.
3572.57 So to be in person together
with people, to see their eyes,
3575.74 to get their excitement, to
get the questions and all
3578.71 the interactions,
that was awesome.
3580.42 And I'm still a sucker and a
believer in the ideal of MIT,
3587.65 of the University.
3588.705 I think it's an
incredible place.
3590.08 There's something
in the air still.
3592.3 But it really hit--
3594.22 the pandemic hit
universities hard because--
3597.52 and I can say this.
3598.36 This is not you saying it.
3599.443 This is me saying it.
3601.03 That administrations--
as in all cases
3605.02 when people criticize
institutions,
3606.94 the pandemic has given more
power to the administration
3610.24 and taken away power from
the faculty and the students,
3612.79 and that's from
everybody involved,
3614.93 including the administration.
3616.27 That's a concern
because a university
3618.01 is about the teachers
and the students.
3620.29 That should be primary.
3621.64 And whenever you have
a pandemic there's
3623.74 an opportunity to increase
the amount of rules.
3626.11 One of the things that
really bothered me,
3628.34 and I'll scream from
the top of the MIT dome,
3632.74 about this is they've instituted
a new temp ticket system.
3637.69 Which is if you're a visitor
to the campus at MIT,
3641.24 you have to register.
3642.268 You have to, first of all,
show that you're vaccinated,
3644.56 but more importantly, there's
a process to visiting.
3647.71 You need to get
permission to visit.
3650.08 One of the reasons I loved MIT,
unlike some other institutions,
3655.39 MIT just leaves the
door open to anyone.
3659.59 In classrooms you can roll
in the ridiculous characters.
3662.71 The students that
are usually doing
3665.95 business stuff or economics
can roll into a physics class
3669.1 and just-- you're
kind of not allowed
3671.71 but it's a gray area
so you let that happen,
3675.567 and that creates a flourishing
of a community that
3677.65 was beautiful.
3678.4 And I think adding extra rules
puts a squeeze on and limits
3683.26 some of the
flourishing, and I hope
3686.05 some of that
dissipates over time
3687.82 as we kind of let go of
the risk aversion that
3693.543 was created by the pandemic.
3694.71 As we kind of enter
the normal return back
3698.35 some of that
flourishing can happen.
3699.95 But when you're actually
in there with the students,
3703.9 it was magic.
3704.96 I love it.
3705.5 I love it.
3706.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, some
of your earliest videos
3707.62 on your YouTube channel were
of you in the classroom, right?
3710.62 That's how this all started.
3711.85 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
3712.27 Yeah.
3712.77 That's how YouTube--
putting stuff on YouTube
3716.03 is terrifying, right?
3717.405 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, especially
3718.78 at the time when you did it.
3719.947 Again, you're a
pioneer in that sense.
3723.19 You did that, Jordan
Peterson did that.
3724.96 Putting up lectures is--
3728.74 yeah.
3729.97 I teach still.
3730.84 Every winter I teach--
3732.52 direct a course, and I'll
be doing even more teaching
3734.83 going forward.
3735.5 But the idea of those
videos being on the web is--
3740.68 yeah, that spikes my
cortisol a little bit.
3742.48 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
3743.23 It's terrifying
because you get--
3744.73 and everybody has a
different experience.
3746.59 For me being a junior
research scientist
3751.0 the kind of natural
concern is like, who am I?
3754.79 And when I was giving
this lecture it's like,
3757.75 I don't deserve any of this.
3758.917 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's your
humility coming through,
3761.125 and I actually
think that humility
3762.67 on the part of an
instructor is good
3764.44 because those that think that
they are entitled, and who else
3770.44 could give this lecture?
3771.58 Then I worry more.
3773.742 I once heard-- I don't
know if it's still
3775.45 true-- that at Caltech,
the great California
3778.45 Institute of Technology
not far from here,
3781.33 that many of the
faculty are actually
3783.31 afraid of the students.
3784.833 Not physically
afraid, but they're
3786.25 intellectually afraid because
the students are so smart.
3789.4 And teaching there can
be downright frightening,
3792.62 I've heard.
3793.12 But that's great.
3793.87 Keeps everybody on their toes.
3797.617 And you know, I've been
corrected in lecture
3799.45 before at Stanford
and elsewhere.
3801.52 When my lab was at UC San
Diego where someone will say,
3804.11 hey, wait, last lecture you said
this and now you said that--
3808.45 or on the podcast.
3809.32 You know?
3809.82 And I think it's that
moment where you sometimes
3812.59 feel that urge to defend and
you go, oh, you're right,
3815.413 and I think it depends
on how one was trained.
3817.33 My graduate advisor was
wonderful at saying,
3820.36 I don't know, all the time.
3821.59 And she went to Harvard,
Radcliffe, UCSF, and Caltech.
3825.7 Brilliant woman.
3827.29 And had no problem
saying, I don't know.
3829.07 LEX FRIDMAN: I don't
have that problem either.
3830.12 So I usually have two guys
that somebody speaks up,
3832.88 grab them, drag them out of
the room, never see them again.
3837.08 So everybody is
really supportive.
3838.96 You don't understand that the
amount of love and support
3841.32 I get is--
3841.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Especially when
the last few students are there
3843.61 and everybody seems to be
nodding as you're going.
3846.065 No, I think that I'd love to
sit-in on one of your lectures.
3849.25 I know very little about AI,
machine learning, or robotics.
3852.31 But--
3852.81 LEX FRIDMAN: Have you
ever talked at MIT?
3854.518 Have you ever given lectures?
3856.545 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah.
3857.97 When I went on the job market
as a faculty member my final two
3861.51 choices were between
MIT Picower--
3863.79 I had an on-paper offer.
3865.26 Wonderful place.
3866.19 Wonderful place to
do neuroscience.
3867.72 And UC San Diego, which is a
wonderful neuroscience program.
3872.003 In the end it made
sense for me be
3873.42 on the West Coast
for personal reasons,
3875.045 but there's some amazing
neuroscience going on there.
3878.22 Goodness.
3878.76 And that's always been true
and is going to continue.
3881.62 It's been a long time since
I've been invited back there.
3884.4 Oddly enough when I started
doing more podcasting--
3887.16 and I still run a lab but I
shrunk my lab considerably
3891.66 as I've done more podcasting--
3893.46 I've received fewer
academic lecture
3895.71 invites, which makes sense.
3896.94 But now they're
sort of coming back.
3898.537 And so when people
invite now I always
3900.12 say, do you want me to talk
about the ventral thalamus
3904.11 and its role in
anxiety and aggression
3907.02 or do you want me to
talk about the podcast?
3909.09 And my big fear is
I'm going to go back
3910.29 to give a lecture about
the retina or something
3911.91 and I'll start off with
an Athletic Greens read
3913.868 or something like
that just reflexively.
3915.81 Just kidding.
3916.38 That wouldn't happen.
3917.255 But listen, I think
it's great to continue
3920.43 to keep a foot in both places.
3922.403 I was so happy to
hear that you're
3923.82 teaching at MIT because
podcasting is one thing,
3926.253 teaching is another, and
there's overlap there
3928.17 in the Venn diagram.
3929.04 But listen, the students
that get to sit-in
3931.445 on one of your
lectures-- and you
3932.82 may see me sitting
there in the audience
3934.487 soon when I creep
into your class.
3936.735 LEX FRIDMAN: In sunglasses.
3937.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right.
3938.22 Wearing a red shirt.
3939.87 You won't recognize me.
3942.81 Are certainly
receiving a great gift.
3945.42 I've watched your lectures on
YouTube, even the early ones,
3947.94 and listen, I know you to
be a phenomenal teacher.
3951.447 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
there's something about--
3953.28 so I'm also doing--
3955.49 I stayed up pretty
late last night
3957.96 working for a
deadline on a paper.
3960.3 One of the things
that I hope to do
3963.6 for hopefully the rest of my
life is to continue publishing,
3968.08 and I think it's really
important to do that
3972.21 even if you continue the podcast
because you want to be just
3976.44 on your own intellectual
and scientific journey
3980.07 as you do podcasting.
3983.04 At least for me, and especially
on the engineering side
3985.53 because I want to
build stuff, and I
3988.41 think that keeps
your ego in check,
3992.18 keeps you humble
because I think if you
3994.82 talk too much on a microphone
you start getting--
3998.54 you might lose track
of the grounding that
4002.8 comes from engineering
and from science
4004.57 and the scientific process and
the criticisms that you get,
4007.03 all that kind of stuff.
4007.87 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And how
slow and iterative it is.
4009.55 We have two papers right now
that are in the revision stage,
4012.25 and it's been a very long road.
4014.26 And I was asked this recently
because I met with my chairman.
4016.93 He said, do you want to
continue to run a lab or are
4018.4 you just going to go
full time on the podcast?
4019.87 And Stanford has been very
supportive, I must say,
4021.953 as I know MIT has been of you.
4024.64 And I said, oh,
I absolutely want
4026.32 to continue to be involved
in research and do research.
4028.975 And when you start
talking about these papers
4030.85 and we're looking over my--
this was my yearly review
4032.92 and looking back
I'm like, goodness,
4034.09 these papers have been in
play for a very long time.
4036.38 So it's a long road but
you learn more and more,
4039.34 and the more time you
spend myopically looking
4041.95 at a bunch of data the more you
learn and the more you think.
4044.92 I totally agree.
4046.12 Talking to these
devices for podcasts
4048.13 is wonderful because it's fun.
4050.12 It relieves a certain itch that
we both have and hopefully it
4053.62 lands some important information
out there for people,
4055.96 but doing research is the--
4060.865 I guess if you know, you know.
4062.18 There's the unpeeling
of the onion,
4065.62 knowing that there could
be something there.
4067.63 There's just nothing like it.
4069.46 LEX FRIDMAN: I mean, you do--
4070.73 especially with the pandemic.
4072.53 And for me, both
Twitter and the podcast
4076.96 have made me much more
impatient about the slowness
4079.72 of the review process because--
4081.707 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Twitter will do that.
4083.29 LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will.
4084.373 But even with podcast
you have a cool--
4086.08 you'll find something cool
and then you have ideas
4089.05 and you'll just say them and
they'll be out pretty quickly.
4092.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Then we do a
post right now about something
4093.73 that we both found interesting
and it's out in the world.
4095.65 Yep.
4095.95 LEX FRIDMAN: And
you can write up
4096.85 something, like there
is a culture in computer
4099.13 science of posting stuff
on arXiv and preprints
4102.162 that don't get annual review,
and sometimes they don't even
4104.62 go through the review process
ever because people just
4107.59 start using them if it's code.
4109.33 And it's like, what's
the point of this?
4111.279 It works.
4112.54 It's self evident that it works
because people are using it,
4116.62 and that I think applies
more to engineering fields
4120.25 because it's an actual
tool that works.
4122.26 It doesn't matter if-- you don't
have to scientifically prove
4125.05 that it works.
4125.689 It works because it's
using for a lot of people.
4127.689 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry
to interrupt, but I just--
4129.981 for point of reference,
the famous paper
4131.835 describing the
double helix which
4133.21 earned Watson and
Crick the Nobel Prize
4135.25 and should have earned Rosalind
Franklin Nobel Prize too,
4138.55 of course, but they got it for
the structure of DNA of course.
4142.84 That paper was never
reviewed at Nature.
4145.09 They published it because its
importance was self evident,
4148.75 or whatever.
4149.547 They decided--
4150.13 LEX FRIDMAN: So the editors.
4151.51 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was that
purely editorial decision,
4153.13 I believe.
4153.662 I mean, that's what I
was told by someone who's
4155.62 currently an editor at Nature.
4157.54 If that turns out
to not be correct
4159.31 someone will tell us in
the comments for sure.
4161.38 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I think--
4162.1 ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's
pretty interesting, right?
4163.149 LEX FRIDMAN: That's
really interested.
4163.689 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps the
most significant discovery
4165.981 in biology and
bioengineering which
4168.069 was leading to
bioengineering as well,
4169.84 of course, of the last
century was not peer reviewed.
4174.04 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, but--
4175.06 so Eric Weinstein,
but many others
4177.31 have talked about
this, which is, I mean,
4181.01 I don't think people understand
how poor the peer review
4187.27 process is.
4188.41 Just the amount of--
because you think peer
4190.51 review it means all the
best peers get together
4194.59 and they review your
stuff, but it's unpaid work
4197.74 and it's usually a
small number of people.
4199.49 And they have a very
select perspective
4201.59 so they might not be the
best person, especially
4203.59 if it's super novel work.
4204.94 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's
who has time to do it.
4206.2 I'm on a bunch of
editorial boards still.
4208.15 Why, I don't know, but I
enjoy the peer review process
4211.21 and sending papers out.
4212.2 Oftentimes the best
scientists are very busy
4214.42 and don't have time to review.
4215.77 And oftentimes the
more premiere journals
4219.55 will select from a kind
of a unique kit of very
4222.7 good scientists who are
very close to the work,
4225.98 sometimes the people are
very far from the work.
4227.98 It really depends.
4228.67 LEX FRIDMAN: And both
have negatives, right?
4230.503 If you're very close
to the work there's
4232.21 jealousy, and all those
basic human things.
4234.04 Very far from the
work you might not
4235.54 appreciate the
nuanced contribution,
4237.672 all that kind of stuff.
4238.63 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
there's psychology.
4239.62 Sorry to interrupt again, but
a good friend of mine who's
4241.995 extremely successful
neuroscientist,
4244.03 Howard Hughes
investigator, et cetera,
4245.86 always told me that they--
4247.495 I won't even say whether
or not who they are.
4249.92 They select their
reviewers on the basis
4252.16 of who has been publishing
very well recently because they
4255.167 assume that that
person is going to be
4256.75 more benevolent because
they have been doing
4258.61 well so that the love expands.
4260.205 LEX FRIDMAN: That's a good
point to that, actually.
4262.33 But the idea is that
editors might actually
4266.05 be the best reviewers, so that
was the traditional-- that's
4269.74 the thing I wanted to mention
that Eric Weinstein talks
4272.26 about, that back several
decades ago editors had
4275.77 much more power.
4276.67 And there is something to be
made for that because editors
4279.88 are the ones who are responsible
for crafting the journal.
4284.38 They really are
invested in this,
4287.74 and they're also
often experts, right?
4290.04 It makes sense for
an editor to have
4291.54 a bit of power in this case.
4293.58 Usually if an idea is truly
novel you could see it,
4298.03 And so it makes
sense for an editor
4301.11 to have more power
in that regard.
4302.7 Of course for me,
I think peer review
4305.22 should be done the
way tweets are done,
4306.85 which is crowdsourced
or Amazon reviews.
4309.187 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let
the crowd decide.
4310.77 LEX FRIDMAN: Let
the crowd decide,
4312.187 and let the crowd add depth
and breadth and context
4319.77 for the contribution.
4321.096 So if the paper overstates
the degree of contribution,
4326.29 the crowd will
check you on that.
4329.37 If there's not enough support
or the conclusions are not
4332.52 supported by the evidence, the
crowd will check you on that.
4336.39 There could be, of course,
political bickering
4339.312 that enters the
picture, especially
4340.77 on very controversial
topics, but I
4342.87 think I trust the
intelligence of human beings
4344.878 to figure that out.
4345.67 And I think most of us
are trying to figure
4348.9 this whole process out.
4349.98 I just wish it was
happening much faster
4352.74 because on the important
topics, the review
4355.44 cycle could be faster.
4357.33 And we learned
that through COVID
4358.74 that Twitter was
actually pretty effective
4361.98 at doing science communication.
4363.99 It was really interesting.
4365.92 Some of the best
scientists took to Twitter
4368.28 to communicate their own
work and other people's work,
4371.88 and always putting
into the caveats
4374.13 that it's not peer reviewed and
so on, but it's all out there
4378.06 and the data just moves so fast.
4380.19 And if you want
stuff to move fast,
4382.38 Twitter is the best medium
of communication for that.
4384.93 It's cool to see.
4385.882 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to take a brief break
4387.84 and thank our sponsor,
InsideTracker.
4390.75 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
4393.39 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
4395.85 to help you better
understand your body
4397.56 and help you reach
your health goals.
4399.36 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
4401.97 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
4404.922 your immediate and
long term health
4406.38 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
4408.955 The problem with a
lot of blood and DNA
4410.58 tests out there, however,
is that you get data
4412.77 back about metabolic
factors, lipids, and hormones
4415.31 and so forth, but you don't
know what to do with those data.
4417.81 InsideTracker
solves that problem
4419.76 and makes it very easy
for you to understand
4421.95 what sorts of nutritional,
behavioral, maybe even
4425.58 supplementation
based interventions
4427.83 you might want to
take on in order
4429.51 to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic factors, hormones,
4432.21 lipids, and other
things that impact
4433.89 your immediate and long
term health to bring
4435.96 those numbers into the
ranges that are appropriate
4438.45 and, indeed, optimal for you.
4440.19 If you'd like to try
InsideTracker you can visit
4442.23 insidetracker.com/huberman to
get $200 off an ultimate plan
4446.88 or 34% off the entire site as
a special Black Friday deal now
4451.41 through the end of November.
4452.64 Again, that's
insidetracker.com/huberman,
4455.61 and use the code
Huberman at checkout.
4457.92 I'm now on Twitter
more regularly,
4460.77 and initially it
was just Instagram.
4462.57 And I remember you and I used to
have these over dinner or drink
4467.19 conversations where I'd say,
I don't understand Twitter.
4469.83 And you'd say, I don't
understand Instagram.
4471.81 And of course, we
understand how it worked
4473.56 and how to work each
respective platform,
4475.72 but I think we were both
trying to figure out
4478.29 what is driving the psychology
of these different venues
4481.35 because they are quite distinct
psychologies for whatever
4484.8 reason.
4485.4 I think I'm finally starting
to understand Twitter and enjoy
4487.9 it a little bit.
4489.15 Initially I wasn't
prepared for the level
4492.96 of reflexive scrutiny.
4496.47 It sounds a little
bit oxymoronic,
4498.0 but that people pick
up on one small thing
4499.8 and then drive it
down that trajectory.
4501.93 It didn't seem to be happening
quite as much on Instagram,
4504.42 but I love your tweets.
4506.13 I do have a question
about your Twitter account
4510.51 and how you-- do you have sort
of internal filters of what
4513.33 you'll put up and won't put up?
4515.31 Because sometimes you'll
put up things that
4517.47 are about life and reflections.
4518.79 Other times you'll put up
things like what you're
4521.73 excited about in
AI, or of course,
4524.67 point to various podcasts
including your own,
4526.89 but others as well.
4529.11 How do you approach
social media?
4530.99 Not in how do you
regulate your behavior
4532.923 on there in terms of how
much time, et cetera.
4534.84 I know you've talked
about that before.
4536.465 But you know, what's your
mindset around social media
4540.09 when you go on there to either
post or forage or respond
4546.87 to information?
4548.02 LEX FRIDMAN: I think
I try to add some--
4552.09 not the sound cliche, but some
love out there into the world
4556.83 into, as OJ Simpson
calls it, Twitter world.
4561.3 I think there is this viral
negativity that can take hold,
4566.43 and I try to find the right
language to add good vibes out
4571.62 there.
4572.13 And it's actually
really, really tricky
4574.17 because there's something about
positivity that sounds fake.
4580.26 I can't quite put
my finger on it,
4582.45 but whenever I talk about
love and positive and almost
4587.55 childlike in my curiosity
and positivity, people
4591.99 start to think, surely he
has skeletons in the closet.
4596.79 There's dead bodies
in his basement.
4598.8 This must be a fake--
4600.09 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
No, it's the attic.
4601.59 LEX FRIDMAN: It's the attic?
4602.25 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The attic.
4602.67 LEX FRIDMAN: I keep
mine in the basement.
4604.378 That's the details.
4605.25 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was
referring to your attic.
4606.27 I don't have an attic or a
basement, nor dead bodies.
4608.872 I just want to be very clear.
4610.08 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
4610.83 I do have an attic and actually
I haven't been up there.
4615.13 Maybe there is bodies up there.
4616.45 But yes, I prefer the basement.
4618.132 It's colder down there.
4619.09 I like it.
4620.62 No, but there's an assumption
that this is not genuine
4624.19 or it's disingenuous
in some kind of way.
4628.04 And so I try to find the
right language for that kind
4630.58 of stuff, how to be positive.
4632.89 Some of it I was really inspired
by Elon's approach to Twitter.
4638.14 Not all of it, but
when he just is silly.
4643.09 I found that silliness--
4646.81 I think it's Hermann Hesse
said something to paraphrase--
4653.833 one of my favorite writers--
4655.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same.
4656.35 LEX FRIDMAN: I
think in Steppenwolf
4658.75 said, learn what is
to be taken seriously
4662.59 and laugh at the rest.
4665.11 I think I try to be
silly, laugh at myself,
4669.28 laugh at the absurdity
of life, and then in part
4672.91 when I'm serious, try to
just be positive, just
4677.29 to see a positive perspective.
4679.81 And also, as you said,
people pick out certain words
4683.728 and so on and they
attack each other,
4685.27 attack me over certain usage
of words in a particular tweet.
4689.17 I think the thing I try to do is
think positively towards them,
4694.24 like do not escalate.
4695.83 So whenever somebody's
criticizing me and so on,
4698.74 I just smile.
4700.84 If there's a lesson to
be learned, I learn it
4703.09 and then I just send
good vibes their way.
4706.15 Don't respond, and
just hopefully,
4709.87 through karma and through the
ripple effect of positivity,
4715.3 have an impact on them and
the rest of the Twitter.
4718.87 And what you find
is that builds--
4722.74 your actions create
the community.
4725.08 So how I behave gets me
surrounded by certain people.
4729.25 But lately, especially Ukraine
is one topic like this,
4734.23 I also thought
about talking to--
4737.53 somebody who reached out
to me is Andrew Tate,
4739.9 who's extremely controversial.
4742.18 From the perspective of a lot
of people is a misogynist.
4745.51 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I've heard his name
4747.01 and I know that there's a lot
of controversy around him.
4749.343 Maybe you could familiarize me.
4751.33 I've been pretty nose
down in podcast prep
4753.37 and I tried to do this
vacation thing for about three,
4756.37 four weeks.
4757.09 LEX FRIDMAN: I've
heard about that.
4757.81 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
4758.727 And it sort of worked.
4760.54 I did get some time in
the Colorado wilderness
4762.91 by myself, which was great.
4765.47 I did get some downtime.
4769.12 But in any event, it mainly
consisted of reading and--
4773.77 LEX FRIDMAN: And nature?
4775.42 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading
and nature, sauna, ice bath,
4778.33 working out, good food,
a little extra sleep,
4781.64 these kinds of things I
really felt I needed it.
4783.64 But I am pretty
naive when it comes
4786.85 to the kind of
current controversies
4789.4 but I've heard his
name, and I think
4791.72 he's been deplatformed
on a couple of platforms.
4793.72 Do I have that right?
4794.56 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's
been-- so I should also
4796.518 admit that while I might
know more than you,
4799.94 it's not by much.
4801.47 So it's like a
five-year-old talking
4803.26 to a four-year-old right now.
4804.542 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he
an athlete, a podcaster?
4806.5 LEX FRIDMAN: So basic summary,
he used to be a fighter,
4811.34 a kickboxer, I believe.
4813.26 Was pretty successful.
4814.57 And then during
that and after that
4818.92 I think he was on
a reality show,
4821.08 and he had all these programs
that are basically pickup
4825.82 artist advice.
4827.11 He has this community of
people where he gives advice
4829.9 on how to pick up women, how to
be successful in relationships,
4833.75 how to make a lot of
money, and it costs money
4837.73 to enter those programs.
4839.27 So a lot of the criticism
that he gets is kind of--
4843.31 it's like a pyramid scheme
where you convince people
4848.05 to join so that they
can make more money
4850.01 and then they convince others
to join, and that kind of stuff.
4852.593 But that's not why I'm
interested in talking to him.
4854.89 I'm interested because
one of the guests--
4857.59 maybe I should mention who, but
one of the female guests I had,
4861.31 really a big scientist, said
that her two kids that are 13
4867.55 and 12 really look up
to Andrew to entertain--
4871.57 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it male
children, female children?
4873.82 LEX FRIDMAN: Male.
4874.81 And I hear this
time and time again.
4876.74 So he is somebody that a lot of
teens, young teens, look up to.
4882.43 So I haven't done
serious research.
4886.96 I usually try to avoid doing
research until I agree to talk
4891.07 and then I go deep.
4892.88 But there is an
aspect to the way
4896.74 he talks about women that, while
I understand and I understand
4903.0 certain dynamics in
relationships work for people
4906.09 and he's one such
person, but I think
4911.11 him being really disrespectful
towards women is not what I--
4918.03 it's not how I see what
it means to be a good man.
4921.98 So the conversation I
want to have with him
4924.14 is about masculinity.
4925.43 What does masculinity
mean in the 21st century?
4928.47 And so when I think
about that kind of stuff,
4931.43 and because we're
talking about Twitter,
4934.08 it's like going into a war zone.
4936.42 I'm a happy go
lucky person, but--
4939.698 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're
like, send me to Ukraine,
4941.74 but I don't want to have
this conversation on Twitter.
4944.1 LEX FRIDMAN: Because
it's a really, really,
4946.69 really tricky one because
also, as you know,
4950.58 when you do a podcast,
everybody wants you to win.
4958.59 It's everything
you do is positive.
4960.36 Maybe you'll say the wrong
thing as inaccurate thing
4963.7 and you can correct yourself.
4965.55 With Andrew Tate, with Donald
Trump, with folks like this,
4970.32 you have to--
4971.58 I mean, it's a
professional boxing.
4973.47 I think you have
to push the person.
4975.6 You have to be really eloquent.
4977.202 You have to be also empathetic
because you can't just
4979.41 do what journalists
do, which is talk down
4981.0 to the person the entire time.
4982.26 That's easy.
4983.23 The hard thing is to
empathize with the person,
4985.2 to understand them, to
steel man their case,
4988.29 but also to make your own case.
4990.01 So in that case about what
it means to be a man, to me
4993.09 a strong man is somebody
who is respectful to women.
4996.51 Not out of weakness, not out
of social justice warrior
4999.24 signaling, and all that kind
of stuff, but out of that's
5002.24 what a strong man does.
5004.13 They don't need to be
disrespectful to prove
5006.56 their position in life.
5008.06 He is often-- now, a lot of
people say it's a character.
5012.65 He's being misogynistic.
5014.69 He's being a misogynist as a
kind of-- for entertainment
5017.51 purposes.
5018.09 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So like an avatar.
5019.548 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
5020.36 But to me, that avatar has a
lot of influence on young folks
5024.8 so the character has impact.
5028.633 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Oh, I don't think
5030.05 you can separate the
avatar and the person
5033.35 in terms of the
impact, as you said.
5035.27 In fact, there are
a number of accounts
5037.34 on Twitter and Instagram and
elsewhere which people have
5039.92 only revealed their first
names or they give themself
5042.71 another name or they're
using a cartoon image.
5045.17 And part of that, I
believe, in at least
5047.807 from some of these individuals
who actually know who they are,
5050.39 I understand as an attempt to
maintain their privacy, which
5054.05 is important to many people.
5057.05 And in some cases so that
they can be more inflammatory
5062.96 and then just pop up
elsewhere as something
5065.15 else without anyone knowing
that it's the same person.
5067.583 LEX FRIDMAN: Some of--
this is the dark stuff.
5069.5 I've been reading a lot about
Ukraine and Nazi Germany,
5074.12 so the '30s and
the '40s and so on,
5075.92 and you get to see how
much the absurdity turns
5079.37 to evil quickly.
5080.49 One of the things I worry--
5081.848 one of the things
I really don't like
5083.39 to see on Twitter
and the internet
5085.52 is how many statements
end with LOL.
5088.85 It's like you think just because
something is kind of funny
5095.36 or is funny or is
legitimately funny,
5098.03 it also doesn't have a
deep effect on society.
5102.36 So that's such a
difficult gray area
5105.68 because some of the best
comedy is dark and mean,
5109.76 but it reveals some important
truth that we need to consider.
5112.67 But sometimes comedy
is just covering up
5116.51 for destructive
ideology, and you
5120.95 have to know the line
between those two.
5123.26 Hitler was seen as a joke in
the late '20s and the '30s
5126.95 in Nazi Germany until the
joke became very serious.
5130.61 You have to be careful
to know the difference
5133.28 between the joke and the
reality and do all that.
5136.73 I mean, in a conversation--
5138.77 I'm just such a big
believer in conversation
5140.96 to be able to reveal something
through conversation,
5144.86 but I don't know.
5145.73 One of the big--
5146.99 you and I challenge
ourselves all the time.
5149.42 I don't know if I
have what it takes
5152.24 to have a good, empathetic,
but adversarial conversation.
5158.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I need to learn
more about this Tate person,
5162.44 or not learn about them.
5163.58 Yeah.
5164.21 It sounds like maybe
it's something to skip.
5165.86 I don't know because, again, I'm
not familiar with the content.
5168.5 But I was going to
ask you whether or not
5170.45 you've seeked out
or whether or not
5172.19 you would ever consider
having Donald Trump as a guest
5174.5 on your podcast.
5175.5 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I've
talked to Joe a lot about this
5178.43 and I really believe I can have
a good conversation with Donald
5188.68 Trump, but I haven't seen many
good conversations with him.
5195.32 So part of me thinks--
5198.89 part of me believes
it's possible,
5201.26 but he often effectively
runs over the interviewer.
5206.238 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You could
sit him down, give him
5208.28 an element in Athletic Greens.
5210.26 LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax.
5211.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That nice, cool, air
5213.35 conditioned black
curtain studio you've got
5216.29 and a different
side might come out.
5218.48 Context is powerful.
5219.77 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good at this,
5221.88 which is relaxing the person.
5223.52 Like here, have a drink.
5226.25 Smoke a joint, or
whatever it is.
5228.83 But this energy of
just, let's relax,
5231.02 and there's laughter and so on.
5232.55 I don't think-- as
people know, I'm just
5237.74 not good at that kind of stuff.
5239.46 So I think the way I could have
a good conversation with him
5243.17 is to really understand
his worldview,
5246.5 be able to steel
man his worldview
5248.18 and those that support him.
5249.65 Which is, I'm sorry
to say for people
5252.77 who seem to hate Donald Trump,
is a very large percentage
5255.29 of the country.
5256.2 And so you have to really
empathize with those people.
5259.13 You have to empathize with
Donald Trump, the human being,
5262.29 and from that perspective,
ask him hard questions.
5266.85 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So who do you think
5268.35 is the counterpoint
if you're going
5270.57 to seek balance in your guests.
5272.97 If you're going
to have Trump on,
5274.42 then you have to have who on?
5276.96 LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
that's interesting.
5278.58 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Anthony Fauci seems
5281.25 to be strongly associated
with counter values, at least
5285.33 in the eye of the public.
5287.91 I think he's retiring soon, but.
5290.675 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
he's retiring.
5292.05 So that's really
interesting, Anthony Fauci.
5295.38 Yeah, definitely, but I don't
think he's a counterbalance.
5298.5 He's a complicated,
fascinating figure
5301.92 who seems to have attracted
a lot of hate and distrust,
5305.5 but also--
5306.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
love from some people.
5307.02 LEX FRIDMAN: And love.
5307.53 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
love from some people.
5309.322 I mean, I know people, not
even necessarily scientists,
5312.66 who have pro-Fauci shirts.
5315.54 I've seen people with anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly,
5319.23 but who adore him.
5320.693 There are people who adore
him in the same way there
5322.86 are people that adore Trump.
5324.027 It's so interesting that
one species of animal
5327.75 you get such divergent
neural circuitry.
5329.88 LEX FRIDMAN: It
almost feels like it's
5331.59 by design and every single topic
we find tension and division is
5336.475 fascinating to watch.
5337.35 I mean, I got to really witness
it from zero to a hundred
5341.43 in Ukraine, where there is
not huge significant division.
5347.34 There was in certain parts of
Ukraine, but across Europe,
5350.86 across the world there
was not that much division
5352.95 between Russia and Ukraine,
and it was just born
5355.83 overnight, this intense hatred.
5358.74 You see the same kind of stuff
with Fauci over the pandemic.
5362.7 At first we were all
huddled in uncertainty.
5367.83 There is a togetherness
with the pandemic.
5369.653 Of course, there
is more difficult
5371.07 because you're isolated.
5372.21 But then you start
to figure out--
5375.295 probably the politicians and
the media try to figure out,
5377.67 how can I take a side
here and how can I
5380.52 now start reporting on
this side or that side
5383.58 and say how the
other side is wrong?
5385.3 And so I think Anthony Fauci
is a part of just being used
5391.7 as a scapegoat
for certain things
5393.47 as part of that kind of
narrative of division.
5396.89 But I think-- so Trump is
a singular figure that,
5403.32 to me, represents something
important in American history.
5405.88 I'm not sure what
that is, but I think
5408.48 you have to think-- you
put on your historian hat,
5411.3 go forward in time,
and think back.
5414.18 How will he be remembered 20,
30, 40, 50 years from now?
5418.53 Who is the opposite of that?
5422.9 You have to--
5424.89 I would really have
to think about that
5426.78 because Trump was so singular.
5428.64 I think AOC is an
interesting one,
5431.19 but she's so young it's
unclear to know how--
5435.36 if she represents a legitimately
large scale movement or not.
5440.64 Bernie Sanders is an
interesting option,
5442.92 but I wish he would be
30, 40 years younger.
5446.13 The young Bernie
would be a good--
5447.78 ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are
scientists working on that.
5450.03 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think so.
5452.547 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
him specifically, but--
5454.38 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah.
5456.24 Maybe him.
5457.187 We never know.
5457.77 There is a big conspiracy
theory that Putin is--
5460.44 that that's a body double.
5463.08 It's no longer him.
5464.105 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Bernie is Putin?
5465.48 LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no.
5466.802 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm having a
hard time merging that image.
5469.26 LEX FRIDMAN: The conspiracy
theory is-- no, no, no.
5471.385 That the Putin we see on
camera today is a body double.
5475.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
one thing that in science,
5478.14 and in particular,
in anatomy, there's
5481.95 a classification scheme for
different types of anatomists,
5485.91 which they either say you're
a lumper or a splitter.
5489.21 Some people like to call a
whole structure something,
5491.43 not necessarily
just for simplicity
5493.15 but for a lot of reasons.
5494.502 And then other people like
to microdivide the nucleus
5496.71 into multiple names.
5497.58 And of course, people used to
be able to name different brain
5499.47 structures after themselves.
5500.89 So that would be the nucleus of
Lex and the Huberman vesiculus
5505.86 or whatever.
5507.6 Less of that nowadays.
5510.21 And by the way, those structures
don't actually exist just yet.
5514.09 We haven't defined those yet.
5515.613 I was making those names up.
5516.78 But what's interesting is it
seems like in the last five
5521.82 years, there's been
a lot of trend--
5525.27 there's been a trend, excuse
me, toward a requirement
5528.93 for lumping.
5530.19 You can't say-- it seems that
it's not allowed, if you will,
5533.95 to say, hey, yeah, you know--
5536.31 and here I'm not stating my--
5537.98 I will never reveal
my preferences
5539.49 about pandemic related things
for hopefully obvious reasons.
5543.9 Some people will say
vaccines, yes, but masks, no.
5546.78 Or vaccines and masks,
yes, but let people work.
5550.077 And other people will say,
no, everyone stay home.
5552.16 And then other people will
say, no, no vaccines, no masks.
5554.61 Let everybody work.
5555.51 No one was saying no vaccines,
no masks, and stay home,
5558.61 I don't think.
5560.13 So there's this sort
of lumping, right?
5565.5 The boundaries around
ideology really
5569.79 did start to defy science.
5571.732 I mean, it wasn't scientific.
5572.94 It was one part science-ish
at times and sometimes
5576.81 really hardcore science.
5577.92 Other times it was
politics, economics.
5579.78 I mean, we really
saw the confluence
5581.61 of all these different
domains of society
5583.71 that use very different
criteria to evaluate the world.
5587.19 I mean, as a
scientist, I remember
5589.92 when the vaccines
first came out and I
5591.99 asked somebody, one
of the early concerns
5594.57 I had that was actually
satisfied for me was,
5598.84 how does this thing turn off?
5600.257 If you start generating
mRNA, how does it actually
5602.34 get turned off?
5602.965 So I asked a friend, they
know a lot about RNA biology.
5606.36 And I said, you know,
how does it turn off?
5608.4 They explained it to me and
I was like, OK, makes sense.
5611.565 I asked some other questions.
5614.37 But most people aren't
going to think about it
5616.68 at that level of
detail necessarily,
5618.51 but it did seem
that there was just
5620.76 kind of amorphous
blobs of ideology
5623.43 that they grabbed on
to things and then
5625.38 there was this need for
a chasm between them.
5628.26 It was almost felt like it
became illegal, in some ways,
5632.1 to want two of the things from
that menu and one of the things
5636.63 from that menu.
5637.32 I really felt like I
was being constrained
5639.09 by a kind of like
Bento box model
5641.49 where I didn't get to define
what was in the Bento box.
5644.22 I could either have Bento
box A or Bento box Z,
5648.15 but nothing in between.
5649.297 LEX FRIDMAN: And I
think on that topic
5650.88 and I think a lot of
topics, most people
5655.62 are in the middle with
humility, uncertainty,
5658.32 and they're just kind of
trying to figure it out.
5660.55 And I think there is just
the extremes defining
5664.59 the nature of this division.
5666.505 So I think it's the
role of a lot of us
5668.13 in our individual
lives, and also
5670.14 if you have a
platform of any kind,
5672.66 I think you have to try to walk
in the middle with the empathy
5675.84 and humility.
5676.44 And that's actually what science
is about is the humility.
5680.44 I'm still thinking about
who's the opposite of Trump.
5683.49 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
maybe there is none.
5685.282 I mean, maybe Fauci is
orthogonal to Trump.
5687.18 I mean, not everything
has an opposite.
5688.99 I mean, maybe he's
an n of 1 maybe
5692.37 he's in the minority
of one because he
5694.32 was an outsider from Washington
who then made it there.
5698.4 LEX FRIDMAN: But also I wonder--
5703.15 you have to pick your battles
because every battle you fight
5706.84 you should take very seriously.
5708.34 And just the amount
of hate I get,
5710.92 I got, and I still get
for having sat down
5713.95 with the Pfizer CEO, that was
a very valuable lesson for me.
5717.55 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, that
one got you a lot of heat?
5719.86 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it
still does because--
5721.81 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because you
had some pretty controversial
5724.333 guests on from time to time.
5725.5 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that one--
5727.66 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he
still the Pfizer CEO?
5729.52 LEX FRIDMAN: I believe so.
5730.54 ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs
turn over like crazy.
5731.89 This is the thing
I didn't realize.
5733.348 In science if somebody moves
institutions it's a big deal.
5736.37 Most people don't have more
than two moves in their career,
5739.42 maybe.
5740.05 But they often move to the
next building is a big deal.
5743.27 But it in biotech--
5745.57 it's like have a former
colleague of mine
5747.76 from San Diego and
he's been a CEO here,
5749.44 then he's a CEO there.
5750.357 He went back to a company
he was a CEO before.
5752.89 He's probably back
at the university
5754.39 we worked at for all I know.
5755.86 It's amazing how much
moving around there.
5757.81 It is a very
itinerant profession.
5759.79 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
I think they're--
5761.41 in certain companies, I guess
in biotech would be the case,
5763.9 the CEO is more of like a
manager type so you can--
5768.7 jumping around benefits
your experience
5770.92 so you become better and
better being a manager.
5773.23 There's some leader
revolutionary CEOs
5777.19 that stick around for
longer because they're
5779.62 so critical to
pivoting a company,
5783.28 like the Microsoft
CEO currently.
5785.83 Sundar Pichai is
somebody like that.
5788.2 Obviously, Elon Musk is
somebody like that that
5791.05 is part of pivoting a company
into new domains constantly,
5794.66 but yeah.
5795.16 In biotech there's a machine.
5798.34 In the eyes of a lot of people,
big pharma is like big tobacco.
5806.995 It's the epitome of everything
that is wrong with capitalism.
5811.78 It's evil, right?
5813.28 And so I showed up
in the conversation
5815.38 where I thought with
a pretty open mind
5817.33 and really asked what I
thought were difficult
5821.08 questions of him.
5822.49 I don't think he's ever sat
down to a grilling of that kind.
5826.01 In fact, I'm pretty sure
they cut the interview short
5828.64 because of that, and
I thought literally it
5831.85 was hot in the room
and we're sweating
5833.74 and I was asking
tough questions.
5835.84 For somebody that half the
country or a large percent
5838.915 of the country believes he's
alleviated a lot of-- he
5842.47 helped, through the financial
resources that Pfizer has,
5846.7 helped alleviate a lot of
suffering in the world.
5849.173 And so I thought for
somebody like that,
5850.84 I was asking pretty
hard questions.
5852.67 Boy, did I get to
hear from the side--
5856.42 usually one of the sides is
more intense in their anger.
5863.29 So there are certain
political topics--
5868.55 like with Andrew
Tate, for example,
5872.48 I would hear from a very--
5876.23 it would probably be
the left, far left,
5878.51 that would write very angrily.
5881.33 And so that's a group
you'll hear from.
5883.67 The Pfizer CEO, I didn't
get almost any messages
5888.2 from people saying, why
did you go so hard on him?
5894.14 He's an incredible human,
incredible leader and CEO
5896.57 of a company that helped
us with the vaccine
5900.05 that nobody thought would be
possible to develop so quickly.
5902.87 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You did not
get letters of that sort?
5904.07 LEX FRIDMAN: I did not.
5905.028 I mean, here and there,
but the sea of people
5908.15 that said everything
from me being
5910.7 weak that I wasn't able
to call out this person,
5913.31 how do you sit down, how do
you platform this evil person,
5917.21 how do you make him look
human, all that kind of stuff.
5921.26 And you have to deal with that.
5922.58 You have to-- of
course, it's great.
5925.67 It's great because I have to
do some soul searching, which
5928.88 is like, did I?
5930.83 You have to ask
some hard questions.
5932.6 I love criticism like that.
5933.89 You get to--
5935.36 I had some low points.
5937.01 There's definitely some despair
and you start to wonder,
5939.5 was I too weak?
5941.83 Should I have talked to him?
5944.23 What is true?
5945.73 And you sit there alone
and just marinate in that.
5949.23 Hopefully over time
that makes you better,
5950.98 but I still don't know what the
right answer with that one is.
5953.563 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I feel
that money plays a role here.
5959.902 When people think
big pharma, they
5962.74 think billions of dollars--
5964.55 maybe even trillions
of dollars, really.
5966.49 And certainly people who make a
lot of money get scrutiny that
5974.98 others don't.
5975.58 Part of it is that they are
often not always visible,
5978.55 but I think that there is
a natural and reflexive--
5982.45 and I'm not justifying it.
5984.31 I certainly don't
feel this because I
5986.8 know some people who
are very wealthy,
5989.02 some people who are very poor.
5990.97 I can't say it scales
with happiness at all.
5994.67 People are always
shocked to hear that,
5998.89 but that's what I've observed
in very wealthy people.
6002.1 But that people who
have a lot of money
6004.59 are often held to a
different standard
6007.8 because people resent
that, some people resent
6011.7 that, and maybe there are
other reasons as well.
6014.7 I mean, among people
who are very wealthy,
6017.85 oftentimes the wish
is for status, right?
6021.51 Not money.
6022.05 You get a bunch of
billionaires in a room,
6023.94 and unless one of
them is Elon, who
6026.91 also has immense status
for his accomplishments,
6030.9 typically if you put a
Nobel Prize winner in a room
6033.45 with a bunch of
billionaires they're
6034.98 all talking to that person.
6036.78 Right?
6037.44 And there are many very
interesting billionaires.
6039.93 But status is something that is
often but not always associated
6047.46 with money, but is a much
rarer form of uniqueness
6053.17 out there, a
positive uniqueness--
6055.21 if one considers status positive
because there's a downside to.
6059.74 So I wonder whether or not the
Pfizer CEO caught extra heat
6063.91 because people
assume, and I probably
6065.86 assume also, that his
salary is quite immense.
6068.5 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
6069.25 So because I have a
lot of data on this.
6071.203 I can answer it.
6071.87 It's a very good hypothesis.
6073.64 Let's test that scientifically.
6075.1 ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's about to
tell me it's a great hypothesis
6076.81 but it's wrong.
6078.1 I know the smirk.
6079.06 I know the smirk.
6079.842 LEX FRIDMAN: I honestly
think it's wrong.
6081.55 That effect is there
for a lot of people,
6083.77 but I think the distrust
is not towards the CEO.
6088.12 The distrust is
towards the company.
6089.8 One of the really
difficult soul searching I
6092.2 had to do, which is just having
to interact with Pfizer folks
6096.16 at every level, from
junior to the CEO,
6099.53 they're all really nice people.
6101.91 They have a mission.
6103.2 They talk about trying
to really help people
6105.522 because that's the
best way to make
6106.98 money is to come
up with medicine
6109.17 that helps a lot of people.
6111.06 The mission is clear.
6112.71 They're all good people, a lot
of really brilliant people,
6115.89 PhDs.
6117.24 So you can have a system
where all the people are good,
6120.66 including the CEO.
6121.74 And by good, I mean
people that really
6124.47 are trying to do everything.
6125.94 They dedicate their
whole life to do good.
6128.58 And yet, you have to think
that that system can deviate
6134.4 from a path that does good
because you start to deceive
6139.2 yourself of what is good,
you turn it into a game
6141.84 where money does come into
play from a company perspective
6145.47 where you convince yourself
the more money you make,
6148.75 the more good you'll
be able to do.
6150.28 And then you start to focus
more and more and more
6153.24 on making more money, and then
you can really deviate and lose
6158.07 track of what is actually good.
6160.05 I'm not saying necessarily
Pfizer does that,
6162.54 but I think companies
could do that.
6164.04 You can apply that criticism
to social media companies,
6167.13 to big pharma companies.
6169.77 One of the big lessons for me--
6171.93 I don't know what the answer
is, but that all the people
6175.47 inside the company
can be good, people
6178.175 you would want to
hang out with, people
6179.8 you would want to work with,
but as a company is doing evil.
6184.5 That's a possibility.
6185.61 So the distrust I don't think
is towards the billionaire
6189.09 individual, which I do
see a lot of in this case.
6192.39 I think it's Wall
Street distrust,
6195.54 that the machinery of this
particular organization
6199.35 has gone off track.
6200.508 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's the
generalization of hate again.
6202.8 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
6203.76 And then good luck
figuring out what is true.
6207.075 This is the tough stuff.
6208.29 But I should say
the individuals--
6212.64 individual scientists
at the NIH and Pfizer
6218.82 are just incredible people.
6222.411 They're really brilliant people.
6225.09 I never trust the administration
or the business people--
6227.91 no offense, business people.
6229.35 But the scientists
are always good.
6232.26 They have the right
motivator in life.
6235.23 But again, they can
have blinders on.
6237.93 Too focused on the science.
6239.28 Nazi Germany has a
history of people
6241.02 just too focused on
the science and then
6243.12 the politicians use the
scientists to achieve
6245.702 whatever end they want.
6246.66 But if you just look narrowly
at the journey of a scientist,
6251.61 it's a beautiful one
because they're ultimately
6253.83 in it for the
curiosity, the moment
6257.1 of discovery versus money.
6259.32 I mean, prestige probably does
come into play later in life,
6262.44 but especially young scientists.
6265.47 They're after the--
it's like they're
6268.74 pulling at the
threat of curiosity
6270.27 to try to discover
something big.
6271.945 They get excited by
that kind of stuff,
6273.57 and it's beautiful to see.
6275.13 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It
is beautiful see.
6275.97 I have a former
graduate student,
6277.345 now a postdoc at
Caltech, and I don't even
6279.75 know she had a cell phone.
6280.87 She would come in the lab, put
her cell phone into the desk,
6283.68 and she was
tremendously productive.
6285.51 But that wasn't why
I brought it up.
6288.27 She was productive as a side
effect of just being absolutely
6291.18 committed and
obsessed to discover
6293.16 the answers to the
questions she was
6294.66 asking as best she could, and
it was-- you could feel it.
6298.23 You could just feel the
intensity, and just incredibly
6302.13 low activation energy.
6303.21 If there was an experiment to
do she would just go do it.
6306.69 You're teaching at MIT.
6308.49 You are obviously
traveling the world,
6312.03 you're right on the podcast
a lot of coverage of chess
6314.76 recently, which is interesting.
6316.09 I don't play chess but--
6317.17 LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, I have
some scientific questions
6318.84 to you about that.
6319.53 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK.
6320.53 Sure.
6322.02 Let's get to those for sure.
6323.22 And then--
6323.79 LEX FRIDMAN: You're
not going to like it.
6324.69 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no.
6325.69 OK.
6326.46 And then also some very--
6329.1 do I have to spell
Massachusetts again?
6331.552 LEX FRIDMAN: Of course.
6334.23 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Also you still seem
6336.18 to have a proclivity for finding
guests that are controversial,
6338.92 right?
6339.42 You're thinking about Tate,
we're talking about Trump,
6340.92 we're talking about the Pfizer
CEO, we're talking about Fauci.
6343.77 These are intense people.
6345.73 And so what we're
getting folks is a--
6348.06 we're not doing
neuroimaging here
6349.53 in the traditional sense of
putting someone into a scanner.
6351.6 What we're doing
here is we're using,
6353.142 as the great Karl Deisseroth,
who was on your podcast--
6356.327 LEX FRIDMAN: Thank you for that.
6357.66 Thank you for connecting us.
6358.71 He's an incredible person.
6359.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's an
incredible psychiatrist,
6361.902 bioengineer, and human
being and writer,
6363.99 and your conversation
with him was phenomenal.
6366.88 I listened to it twice.
6368.55 I actually have taken notes.
6370.5 We talk about it
in this household.
6372.15 We really do.
6374.28 His description of
love is not to be
6377.892 missed, I'll just
leave it at that,
6379.35 because if I try and say
it I won't capture it well.
6381.517 But we're getting
a language based
6385.89 map of at least a portion
of Lex Fridman's brain here.
6390.73 So what else is going on
these days in that brain
6395.01 as it relates to robotics, AI?
6398.13 Our last conversation
was a lot about robots
6401.04 and the potential for
robot-human interaction.
6403.44 Even what is a robot, et cetera.
6406.02 Are you still working on robots
or focused on robots, and where
6410.642 is science showing up in your
life besides the things we've
6413.1 already talked about?
6414.04 LEX FRIDMAN: So I
think the last time
6415.582 we talked was before Ukraine.
6417.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes.
6418.32 You were just about to leave.
6420.42 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
6421.72 I mean--
6422.22 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
that's why I went on.
6423.09 I was like, you
know, this might be
6424.35 the last-- you said you
wanted to come out here
6426.3 before or after.
6426.967 I was like, come
out there before.
6428.79 I want to see you before you go.
6430.2 But here you are in the flesh.
6433.47 LEX FRIDMAN: So a lot of--
6435.51 just a lot of my mind has
been occupied, obviously,
6438.543 with that part of the world.
6439.71 But most of the
difficult struggles
6442.98 that I'm still going through
is that I haven't launched
6446.07 the company that
I want to launch
6447.81 and the company
has to do with AI.
6451.03 I mean, it's maybe a
longer conversation,
6453.0 but the ultimate dream is
to put robots in every home.
6456.15 But short term I see
there a possibility
6460.26 of launching a
social media company,
6462.3 and it's a nontrivial
explanation why that
6466.17 leads to robots in the home.
6467.55 But it's basically
the algorithms
6470.22 that fuel effective
social robotics, so
6474.06 robots that you can form
a deep connection with.
6476.65 And so I've been really-- yeah,
I've been building prototypes
6480.06 but struggling that
I don't have maybe,
6485.07 if I were to be critical,
the guts to launch a company.
6490.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or the time.
6491.825 LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
it's combined.
6493.2 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
you've got the guts.
6494.16 I mean, it's clear if you'll
do an interview with the Pfizer
6497.19 CEO and you're considering
putting this Tate
6499.11 fellow on your podcast and
you've gone to the Ukraine
6502.59 that you have the guts.
6506.31 It means not doing quite
a lot of other things.
6508.427 LEX FRIDMAN: That's what I mean.
6509.76 It does take-- the thing
is, as many people know,
6514.56 when you fill your
day and you're busy,
6517.65 that busyness becomes an excuse
that you use against doing
6523.08 the things that scare you.
6524.73 A lot of people use
family in this way.
6526.83 You know, my wife,
my kids, I can't.
6531.3 When in reality some of the most
successful people have a wife
6534.21 and have kids and have
families and they still do it.
6537.97 And so a lot of times we can
fill the day with busy work,
6541.02 with--
6543.201 yeah, of course, I have podcasts
and all this kind of stuff.
6546.22 And they make me happy and
they're all-- they're wonderful
6548.67 and there's research,
there's teaching, and so on.
6551.29 But all of that can just serve
as an excuse from the thing
6553.71 that my heart says is
the right thing to do,
6557.04 and that's why I don't
have the guts, the guts
6560.19 to say no to
basically everything
6562.05 and then to focus all out.
6563.64 Because part of it is
I'm unlikely to fail
6568.95 at anything in my life
currently because I've already
6571.92 found a comfortable place.
6574.095 With a startup it's
mostly going to be--
6576.84 most likely going to
be a failure, if not
6578.79 an embarrassing failure.
6581.19 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
the machine learning data
6583.32 that I'm aware of--
6584.36 I don't know a lot
about machine learning,
6586.11 but within the realm
of neuroscience,
6588.09 say that a failure
rate of about 15%
6591.54 is optimal for
neuroplasticity and growth.
6594.72 Whether or not that translates
to all kinds of practices
6597.96 isn't clear, but getting
trials right 85% of the time
6602.01 seems to be optimal
for language learning,
6604.89 seems to be optimal
for mathematics,
6607.41 and it seems to be optimal
for physical pursuits
6610.68 on average, right?
6611.58 I'm sure I'm going--
6613.405 you have more machine
learning geeks
6616.297 that listen to your podcast
than listen to this podcast,
6618.63 but it doesn't mean you have
to fail on 15% of your weight
6621.93 sets, folks.
6622.5 I mean, it could be 16%.
6624.0 No, I'm just kidding.
6626.52 It's not exact, but it's a
pretty good rule of thumb.
6630.093 LEX FRIDMAN: I think a
lot of startup founders
6632.01 would literally murder
for 85% chance of success.
6637.17 I think given all the
opportunities I have,
6641.01 the skill set, the funding,
all that kind of stuff,
6644.82 my chances are relatively
high for success.
6647.67 But what relatively high
means in the startup world
6650.46 is still far, far below 85.
6653.79 You're talking about
single digit percentages.
6655.89 Most startups fail.
6657.062 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I think it means--
6658.77 the decision to focus on the
company and not on other things
6661.27 means the decision to close
the hatch on dopamine retrieval
6664.86 from all these other things that
are very predictable sources
6667.65 of dopamine.
6669.45 Not that everything is
dopamine, but dopamine
6672.45 is, I think, the primary
chemical driver of motivation.
6675.75 If you know that you can get
some degree of satisfaction
6679.38 from scrolling social media
or from that particular cup
6682.74 of coffee, that's what
you're going to do.
6684.61 That's what you're going to
consume unless you somehow
6687.45 invert the algorithm
and you say,
6691.14 it's actually my
denial of myself
6694.71 drinking that coffee that's
going to be the dopamine.
6697.29 Right?
6697.79 LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting.
6699.045 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
that's the beauty
6699.9 of having a forebrain is that
you can make those decisions.
6702.69 This is the essence,
I do believe,
6704.65 of what we see of David Goggins.
6706.37 There's much more there.
6707.37 There's a person that none
of us know and only he knows,
6711.55 of course.
6712.11 But the idea that the pain
is the source of dopamine.
6717.94 The limbic friction, as I
sometimes like to call it,
6720.18 is the source of dopamine.
6721.32 That runs counter to how
most nervous systems work,
6724.23 but it's decision based, right?
6726.63 It's not because his
musculature is a certain way
6729.24 or he had CRISPR or something.
6731.76 It's because he decides that.
6734.94 And I think that's
amazing, but what
6737.065 it means in terms of
starting a company
6738.69 and changing priorities is
a closing the hatch on all
6742.2 or many of the current
sources of dopamine
6744.31 so that you can derive
dopamine from the failures
6747.0 within this narrow
context, and there's
6748.92 a very reductionist view
and neurocentric view
6754.243 of what we're talking about.
6755.41 But I think about this a lot.
6757.02 I mean, the decision to choose
one relationship versus another
6760.59 is a decision to close down
other opportunities, right?
6763.59 So I think that the
decision to order one thing
6767.64 off the menu versus others
is the decision to close down
6770.7 those other hatches.
6771.94 So I think that you
absolutely can do it.
6774.7 It's just a question of,
can you flip the algorithm?
6777.93 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
6778.68 Remap the source of
dopamine to something else.
6781.472 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
6782.43 And maybe go out there
not to succeed but make
6786.24 the-- the journey is the
destination type thing,
6788.67 but when you're financially
vested in your time--
6791.795 and as far as I
know, we only get
6793.17 one life, at least
on this planet
6795.36 and you want to spend
that wisely, right?
6799.08 LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot of the
people that surround you--
6803.96 people are really
important, and I
6807.02 don't have people around me that
say you should do a start up.
6813.558 It's very difficult to
find such people because--
6815.6 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is Austin
big startup culture right now?
6817.25 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it is.
6817.82 It is.
6817.97 But it doesn't make sense
for me to do a startup.
6820.26 This is what the people
that love me my whole life
6822.778 have been telling me,
it doesn't make sense
6824.57 what you're doing right now.
6826.34 Just do the thing you
were doing previously.
6828.26 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why
do I get the sense
6829.13 that because they
are saying this
6830.42 you're apt to go against them?
6831.47 LEX FRIDMAN: No.
6831.56 Actually, I was never
that, unfortunately.
6833.36 Unfortunately, I need--
6836.12 I've talked to people I love,
my parents, family, and so on,
6839.63 friends.
6840.38 I'm one of those people that
needs unconditional support
6843.98 for difficult things.
6845.54 I know myself coaching
wise is good--
6849.98 so here's how I
get coached best.
6852.86 Let's say wrestling.
6854.39 I like a coach that says,
you want to win the Olympics?
6860.03 They will not-- if
I say I want to win
6862.258 the gold medal at the
Olympics in freestyle
6864.05 wrestling I want a coach that
doesn't blink once and hears me
6870.05 and believes that I
can do it, and then
6872.99 is viciously intense and
cruel to me on that pursuit.
6879.62 If you want to do
this, let's do this.
6881.77 Right?
6882.65 But that's support.
6885.35 That positivity, I don't--
6888.05 I'm never-- I'm not energized,
nor do I see that as love,
6894.29 a person saying--
6896.06 basically criticizing that.
6898.37 Saying, you're too old to win
the Olympic gold medal, right?
6903.89 Or all the things
you can come up with.
6906.59 That's not helpful to me
and I can't find a dopamine,
6909.71 or I haven't yet, a dopamine
source from the haters.
6914.57 Basically people that are
criticizing you, trying
6916.97 to prove them wrong.
6919.43 It never got me off.
6920.87 It never--
6922.808 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas some
people seem to like that.
6925.1 I mean, David Goggins
seems to come to mind.
6928.34 He seems driven by many sources.
6929.96 He has access--
6930.92 I don't know because
I've never asked him,
6932.78 but if I were to
venture a guess,
6935.25 I'd say that he probably
has a lot of options
6938.3 inside his head as how to
push through challenge.
6941.54 Not just overcome pain,
but he'll post sometimes
6945.65 about the fact that
people will say
6947.69 this or people will do this
and talk about the pushback
6951.35 approach.
6951.86 He'll also talk
about the pushback
6954.29 approach that's purely
internal that doesn't
6956.33 involve anyone else.
6957.32 Great versatility there.
6958.55 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
6959.3 There's literally
like a voice he
6960.68 yells that represents
some kind of devil that
6965.81 wants him to fail,
and he calls them
6969.68 bitch and all kinds of things
saying, you know, fuck you.
6972.44 I'm not.
6973.49 There's always an enemy and
he's going against that enemy.
6976.91 I mean, I wish--
6977.872 maybe that's something.
6978.83 I mean, it's really interesting.
6980.163 Maybe you can remap it this
way so that you can construct--
6985.28 that's a kind of
obvious mechanism.
6987.17 Construct an amorphous
blob that is a hater that
6991.58 wants you to fail, right?
6993.17 That's kind of the
David Goggins thing.
6995.54 And that blob says you're
too weak, you're too dumb,
7001.9 you're too old,
you're too fat, you're
7003.97 too whatever, and getting you
to want to quit and so on.
7007.55 And then you start getting
angry at that blob,
7009.76 and maybe that's
a good motivator.
7011.29 I haven't personally
really tried that.
7013.18 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I've
had external challenge when
7016.42 I was a postdoc, very
prominent laboratory--
7020.26 several prominent
laboratories, in fact,
7021.93 were working on the
same thing that I was,
7023.68 and I was just
this lowly postdoc
7025.18 working on a project
pretty independent
7026.86 from the lab I was in.
7027.82 And there was
competition but there
7030.04 was plenty of room for everybody
to win, but in my head--
7033.82 and frankly, I won't
disclose who this is.
7037.03 And because there was some
legitimate competition there
7040.6 and a little bit of
friction-- not too much,
7042.73 healthy scientific friction--
7045.16 yeah, I might have pushed
a few extra hours or more,
7048.88 a little bit.
7049.45 I have to say, it
felt metabolizing.
7053.29 It felt catabolic, right?
7056.86 I couldn't be sustained by it.
7058.24 And I contrast that with
the podcast or the work
7060.94 that my laboratory
is doing now focused
7062.89 on stress and human performance,
et cetera, and it's pure love.
7067.96 It's pure curiosity and love.
7069.4 I mean, there are hard
days, but I never-- there's
7071.8 no adversary in the picture.
7074.53 They're the practical
workings of life that--
7077.845 LEX FRIDMAN: That was the thing
that Joe really inspired me on,
7080.47 and people do create
adversarial relationships
7083.44 in podcasting because you get--
7086.11 YouTubers do this.
7088.471 They hate seeing somebody
else be successful.
7090.89 There's a feeling of
jealousy, and some people even
7097.06 see that as healthy.
7099.61 Mr. Beast is somebody, some
of these popular YouTubers,
7103.03 how do they get 100 million
views and I only get 20 views?
7106.452 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted his entire--
7108.41 according to him,
his entire life
7110.1 he's been focused on becoming
this massive YouTube channel.
7112.7 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that,
he's inspiring in many ways,
7114.908 but there's some
people that become
7116.54 famous for doing much less
insane pursuit of greatness
7124.61 than Mr. Beast.
7125.69 People become famous and
on social media and so on,
7128.93 and it's easy to
be jealous of them.
7130.97 One of the early things
I've learned from Joe just
7133.91 being a fan of his
podcast is how much
7135.8 he celebrated everybody.
7137.18 And again, maybe I ruined
my whole dopamine thing
7140.9 but I don't get energized by
people that become popular.
7145.04 In the podcasting
space and YouTube,
7147.24 it doesn't-- it's awesome.
7148.67 All of it is awesome and
I'm inspired by that.
7151.82 But the problem is that's
not a good motivator.
7154.28 Inspiration is like, oh,
cool, humans can do this.
7156.935 This is beautiful.
7158.0 But it's not--
7159.14 I'm looking.
7159.8 I'm looking for a
forcing function.
7163.14 That's why I gave away
the salary from MIT.
7165.35 I was hoping my bank
account had zero.
7167.9 That would be a forcing
function to be like, oh shit.
7171.45 You know?
7171.95 And you're not allowed
to have a normal job,
7174.09 so I wanted to launch--
7175.16 and then the podcast
becomes a source of income.
7178.8 So it's like, goddammit.
7179.943 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
7180.86 Yeah.
7181.36 Well, and here I have
to confess my biases.
7187.25 You are so good at what you
do in the realm of podcast--
7192.375 and you're excellent at
other things as well,
7194.25 I just have less
experience in those things.
7197.84 I know here I'm taking
the liberty of speaking
7200.208 for many, many people
in just saying,
7201.75 I sure as hell hope you
don't shut down the podcast.
7207.42 But as your friend
and as somebody
7209.76 who cares very deeply about
your happiness and your deeper
7212.61 satisfaction, if it's
in your heart's heart
7216.06 to do a company, well then,
damn it, do the company.
7220.98 LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot
of it I wouldn't even
7222.93 categorize as happiness.
7224.58 I don't know if you have
things like that in your life,
7227.25 but I'm probably the happiest
I could possibly be right now.
7231.533 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's wonderful.
7232.95 LEX FRIDMAN: But
the thing is there's
7234.792 a longing for the
start up that has
7236.25 nothing to do with happiness.
7237.54 It's something else.
7238.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's that itch.
7239.58 That's that itch.
7240.288 LEX FRIDMAN: I'm pretty sure
I'll be less happy because it's
7243.09 a really tough process.
7246.75 I mean, to whatever degree
you can extract happiness
7250.62 from struggle, yes, maybe.
7252.33 But I don't see it.
7253.39 I think I'll have some
very, very low points.
7255.3 There's a lot of people
who find companies--
7258.54 found companies know about.
7261.93 And I also want to
be in a relationship,
7263.74 I want to get married,
and sure as hell
7266.58 a startup is not
going to increase
7268.62 the likelihood of that.
7270.758 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We
could start up a family
7272.55 and start a company.
7273.832 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's a--
7275.04 I'm a huge believer
in that, which
7277.02 is get in a relationship
at a low point
7280.32 in your life, which is--
7283.305 [LAUGHTER]
7283.862 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry.
7284.82 I'm not disputing your stance,
nor am I agreeing with it.
7288.57 It's just every once
in a while there's
7291.21 a Lex Fridmanism that hits a
particular circuit in my brain.
7295.84 I have to just laugh out loud.
7297.09 LEX FRIDMAN: I just
think that it's
7299.19 easy to have a relationship
when everything is good.
7302.04 The relationships that become
strong and are tested quickly
7306.33 are the ones when
shit is going down.
7308.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, then
there's hope for me yet.
7316.818 Before we sat down I was
having a conversation
7319.53 with my podcast
producer, who is a--
7322.635 I wouldn't say avid, rather he's
a rabid consumer of podcasts
7326.55 and finds these amazing
podcasts, small podcasts
7331.27 and unique episodes.
7332.73 Anyway, we were talking
about some stuff
7335.49 that he had seen and read
in the business sector,
7338.11 and he was talking about
the difference between job,
7342.0 career, and a calling, right?
7343.74 And I think he was
extracting this
7345.54 from conversations of CEOs
and founders, et cetera.
7350.76 I forget the specific
founders that
7354.12 brought this to light for him.
7355.65 But that this idea that
if you focus on a job
7358.98 you can make an income, and
hopefully you enjoy your job
7361.4 or not hate it too much.
7362.4 A career represents a
sort of, in my mind,
7365.25 a kind of series of
evolutions that one
7366.9 can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera.
7369.54 But a calling has a whole
other level of energetic pull
7375.3 to it because it
includes career and job
7377.61 and it includes this
concept of a life.
7380.13 It's very hard to draw the line
between a calling in career
7383.31 and a calling in the
other parts of your life.
7385.66 So the question,
therefore, is, do
7389.67 you feel a calling
to start this company
7393.6 or is it more of a compulsion
that irritates you?
7399.81 Is it something you
wish would go away
7401.64 or is it something that
you hope won't go away?
7404.372 LEX FRIDMAN: No, I
hope it won't go away.
7406.08 It's a calling.
7406.77 It's a calling.
7407.84 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's beautiful.
7409.257 LEX FRIDMAN: It's like
when I see a robot--
7414.51 when I first
interacted with robots,
7416.61 and it became even stronger the
more sophisticated the robots
7419.19 I interacted, with
I see a magic there.
7422.31 And you're like,
you look around,
7424.29 does anyone else see this magic?
7427.2 It's kind of like maybe
when you fall in love,
7430.41 like that feeling.
7434.16 Does anyone else
notice this person
7435.712 that just walked in the room?
7436.92 I feel that way
about robots, and I
7439.92 can elaborate what that
means but I'm not even sure I
7444.15 can convert it into words.
7445.47 I just feel like the
social integration
7451.93 of robots in society will create
a really interesting world.
7456.17 And our ability to
anthropomorphize
7459.16 when we look at a robot and
our ability to feel things
7462.4 when we look at a robot is
something that most of us
7464.89 don't yet experience,
but I think
7466.75 everybody will experience
in the next few decades.
7469.76 And I just want to be
a part of exploring
7474.43 that because it hasn't been
really thoroughly explored.
7477.52 The best roboticists
in the world
7479.65 are not currently working
on that problem at all.
7482.43 They try to avoid human
beings completely,
7484.57 and nobody's really
working that problem
7487.122 in terms of when you
look at the numbers.
7488.83 All the big tech companies
that are investing money,
7491.29 the closest thing
to that is Alexa
7494.23 and basically being a servant
to help tell you the weather
7499.27 or play music and so on.
7500.66 It's not trying to
form a deep connection.
7502.67 And so sometimes you
just notice the thing.
7507.34 Not only do I notice the magic.
7510.29 There's a gut
feeling, which I try
7512.75 not to speak to because
there's no track record,
7516.03 but I feel like I can be good
at bringing that magic out
7522.14 of the robot.
7523.43 And there's no data that
says I would be good at that,
7526.74 but there's a feeling.
7527.817 It's just a feeling.
7531.253 Because I've done
so many things--
7532.67 I love doing playing guitar,
all that kind of stuff, jujitsu.
7536.96 I've never felt that feeling.
7538.43 When I'm doing
jujitsu I don't feel
7540.8 the magic of the genius
required to be extremely good.
7544.88 At guitar I don't
feel any of that.
7546.77 But I've noticed that in
others, great musicians,
7551.285 they notice the magic
about the thing they do
7556.16 and they ran with it.
7557.34 And I just always thought--
7560.03 I think it had a different
form before I knew robots
7563.51 existed, before I existed.
7565.49 The form was more about
the magic between humans.
7575.145 I think of it as love, but
the smile that two friends
7578.34 have towards each other
when I was really young.
7580.48 And people would be excited
when they first know each other
7584.28 and notice each other,
and there's that moment
7588.09 that they share that
feeling together.
7591.11 I was like, wow, that's
really interesting.
7593.43 It is really interesting
that these two
7595.25 separate intelligent
organisms are
7597.02 able to connect all of a sudden
on this deep emotional level.
7600.05 It's like, huh.
7602.075 It's just beautiful to see,
and I notice the magic of that.
7605.0 And then when I started a
programming-- programming,
7610.58 period, but then programming
AI systems, you realize, oh,
7613.88 that could be--
7614.8 that's not just between
humans and humans.
7616.55 That could be humans and
other entities, dogs, cats,
7621.42 and robots.
7622.22 And so I-- for some reason
it hit me the most intensely
7626.3 when I saw robots.
7628.19 So yeah, it's a calling.
7629.96 But it's a calling that I can
just enjoy the vision of it,
7641.29 the vision of a future world, of
an exciting future world that's
7644.89 full of cool stuff, or I can
be part of building that.
7647.92 And being part of
building that means
7649.84 doing the hard work
of capitalism, which
7652.09 is like raising funds from
people, which for me, right
7657.61 now, is the easy part, and
then hiring a lot of people.
7660.815 I don't know how much you know
about hiring, but hiring--
7663.19 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring
excellent people.
7664.33 LEX FRIDMAN:
Excellent people that
7665.747 will define the
trajectory of not only
7667.84 your company, but your whole
existence as a human being.
7670.81 And building it up, not
failing them because now
7674.05 they all depend on you,
and not failing the world
7677.92 with an opportunity
to bring something
7680.29 that brings joy to people.
7681.46 And all of that
pressure, just non-stop
7685.358 fires that you have to put out.
7686.65 The drama, the having
to work with people
7689.59 you've never worked with like
lawyers and human resources
7693.01 and supply chain.
7694.51 And because this is
very compute heavy,
7700.99 the computer infrastructure,
managing security,
7703.9 cybersecurity, because you're
dealing with people's data.
7707.93 So now you have to understand
not only the cybersecurity
7712.36 of data and the privacy, how
to maintain privacy correctly
7715.09 with data, but also the
psychology of people trusting
7717.7 you with their data.
7718.66 And how, if you look at Mark
Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey
7724.96 and those folks,
they seem to be hated
7726.88 by a large number of people.
7728.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed--
7729.69 I didn't--
7730.338 LEX FRIDMAN: Much less so, yes.
7731.63 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think I
always think of Jack as a loved
7734.62 individual, but--
7736.21 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, you
have a very positive view
7738.49 of the world, yes.
7739.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I like Jack a
lot and I like his mind and I--
7741.85 someone close to him
described him to me
7745.6 recently as he's an
excellent listener.
7748.545 That's what they
said about Jack,
7749.92 and that's my
experience of him too.
7752.11 Very private person so
we'll leave it at that.
7754.24 But listen, I think
Jack Dorsey is
7760.456 one of the greats of
the last 200 years
7765.52 and is just much quieter
about his stance on things
7769.145 than a lot of people.
7770.02 But much of what we see in
the world that's wonderful,
7773.03 I think we owe him
a debt of gratitude.
7775.04 I'm just voicing my
stance here, but--
7777.133 LEX FRIDMAN: And the person.
7778.3 This is really important.
7779.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
7780.057 LEX FRIDMAN: A wonderful
person, a brilliant person,
7782.74 a good person,
but you still have
7785.77 to pay the price of making
any kind of mistakes
7790.06 as the head of a company.
7791.53 You don't get any extra bonus
points for being a good person.
7795.64 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But his
willingness to go on Rogan
7797.83 and deal directly and say,
I don't know an answer
7803.423 to that in some cases.
7804.34 But to deal directly with some
really challenging questions
7806.98 to me earned him
tremendous respect.
7809.092 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
7809.8 As an individual.
7810.79 He was still part of him--
7813.04 you've said-- OK,
and I love Jack too,
7815.35 and I interact with him often.
7816.77 ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's
been on your podcast.
7817.78 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
7818.95 But he's also part of a
system, as we talked about,
7821.83 and I would argue that Jack
shouldn't have brought anyone
7825.64 else with him on that podcast.
7828.58 If you go--
7829.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Oh, that's right.
7829.36 He had a cadre of--
7830.71 LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, he had I
guess the head legal with him.
7836.71 And also it requires a
tremendous amount of skill
7840.22 to go on a podcast
like Joe Rogan
7842.41 and be able to win over
the trust of people
7845.62 by being able to be
transparent and communicate
7847.75 how the company really works
because the more you reveal
7850.385 about how a social
media company works,
7852.01 the more you open
up for security,
7855.1 the vector of attacks increases.
7857.32 Also, there's a lot of
difficult decisions in terms
7859.81 of censorship and
not that are made
7861.85 that if you make
them transparent
7863.89 you're going to get an order
of magnitude more hate.
7866.568 So you have to make all
those kinds of decisions,
7868.61 and I think that's one of
the things I have to realize
7873.43 is you have to take that
avalanche of potentially
7880.84 hate if you make mistakes.
7883.33 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you
have a very clear picture
7886.96 of this architecture
of what's required
7889.63 in order to create a company.
7891.92 Of course, there's
division of labor too.
7894.102 I mean, you don't have to do
all of those things in detail,
7896.56 but finding people that
are excellent to do--
7899.92 to run the critical
segments is obviously key.
7903.973 I'll just say what
I said earlier,
7905.39 which is if it's in your heart's
heart to start a company,
7909.55 if that, indeed,
is your calling,
7911.2 and it sounds like it
is, then I can't wait.
7915.552 LEX FRIDMAN: Does the
heart have a heart?
7917.26 I don't know.
7917.71 What's that
expression even mean?
7919.09 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not.
7920.5 LEX FRIDMAN: We
romanticize the heart.
7921.04 ANDREW HUBERMAN: In my lab
at one point, early days
7922.81 we worked on cuttlefish, and
they have multiple hearts,
7925.27 but they pump green
blood, believe it or not.
7927.43 Very fascinating animal.
7929.47 Speaking of hearts
and green blood,
7933.76 earlier today
before we sat down I
7935.89 solicited four questions on
Instagram in a brief post.
7941.342 LEX FRIDMAN: Do you want to--
7942.55 ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you'll--
7943.12 LEX FRIDMAN: --look
at some of them?
7944.62 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, let's
take these in real time.
7947.2 My podcast team is always
teasing me that I never
7949.54 have any charge on my phone.
7951.19 I'm one of these people that
likes to run in the yellow,
7955.69 or whatever it is.
7956.502 LEX FRIDMAN: An iPhone?
7957.46 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
7957.835 LEX FRIDMAN: It's funny
how always the iPhone
7959.92 people are out of battery.
7961.07 It's weird.
7961.57 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I just got a new one.
7962.41 LEX FRIDMAN: So weird.
7962.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, this
one has plenty of battery.
7964.18 I just got a new one so
I have different numbers
7966.19 for different things,
personal and work, et cetera.
7970.21 I'm trying that now.
7972.55 All right.
7973.9 Get into the--
7976.21 LEX FRIDMAN: I have a chess
thing too to mention to you.
7978.765 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Oh, yes, please.
7980.14 Will I insult you if I look up
these questions as you ask me?
7983.387 LEX FRIDMAN: No, no.
7984.22 But I will insult you by asking
you this question because I
7986.53 think it's hilarious.
7987.52 So there's been a controversy
about cheating where
7990.19 Hans Niemann, who
is a 2,700 player--
7992.527 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah.
7993.61 LEX FRIDMAN: --was
accused of cheating.
7994.48 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I saw that
clip on your clips channel.
7995.8 By the way, I love
your clips channel,
7997.12 but I listen to
your full channel.
7998.537 LEX FRIDMAN: The big accusation
is that he cheated by having--
8002.13 I mean, it's half
joke but it's starting
8004.41 getting me to wonder whether--
8007.41 so that you can cheat by having
vibrating anal beads so you
8012.6 can send messages to--
8014.772 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let's
rephrase that statement.
8016.98 Not you can, but one can.
8019.06 LEX FRIDMAN: One can.
8019.935 One can.
8020.37 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, thank you.
8020.91 LEX FRIDMAN: That was
a personal attack, yes.
8022.785 But it made me realize, I mean--
8024.272 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just going
to adjust myself in my seat
8026.73 here.
8027.863 LEX FRIDMAN: I use
it all the time
8029.28 for podcasting to
send myself messages
8031.62 to remind myself of notes.
8034.53 But it's interesting.
8035.52 I mean, it--
8036.97 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not
going to call you again.
8039.63 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that's
exactly where I keep my phone.
8042.96 It did get me down this
whole rabbit hole of, well,
8045.66 how would you be able to
send communication in order
8050.92 to cheat in different sports?
8052.27 I mean, that doesn't even have
to do with chess in particular,
8055.9 but it's interesting
in chess and poker
8058.15 that there's mechanisms
modern day where
8062.83 you're streaming live
the competition so people
8066.16 can watch it on TV.
8067.51 If they can only send
you a signal back, they--
8073.98 it's just a fun little
thing to think about
8076.35 and if it's possible
to pull off.
8078.54 So I wanted to get your
scientific evaluation of that--
8083.41 ANDREW HUBERMAN: To
cheat using some sort
8085.38 of interoceptive device?
8086.73 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
8087.48 Vibrating of some kind.
8088.438 Yeah.
8088.938 Or no, no.
8089.55 That's one way to send
signals is, like, Morse code,
8091.95 basically.
8092.73 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
8093.647 So there's a famous--
8095.55 I believe there's
a famous real world
8097.95 story of physics students--
8100.722 I'm going to get
some of this wrong
8102.18 so I'm saying this in
kind of coarse form
8105.162 so that somebody
will correct this.
8106.62 But I believe it was physics
graduate students from UC Santa
8111.18 Cruz or somewhere else,
maybe it was Caltech--
8114.42 a bunch of universities
so that no one associates
8117.615 it with any one university
that went to Vegas
8120.63 and used some sort of tactile
device for card counting thing.
8127.38 This was actually
demonstrated also--
8130.575 not this particular
incident, I don't think--
8132.45 in the movie Casino
where they spotted a--
8137.235 I remember Robert
De Niro, who you
8138.99 have a not so vague resemblance
to, by the way, in Taxi Driver.
8143.7 LEX FRIDMAN: God, I wish I had
a De Niro impression right now.
8147.39 Travis Bickle.
8148.752 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Look it up, folks.
8150.21 Travis Bickle is if Lex ever
shaved his head into a Mohawk.
8154.5 LEX FRIDMAN: I would.
8155.41 ANDREW HUBERMAN: So he had a
tapping device on his ankle
8158.418 that was signaling.
8159.21 Someone else was counting
cards and then signaling
8161.4 to that person.
8162.27 So yeah, that could be
done in the tactile way.
8166.29 It could be done,
obviously, earpieces
8168.39 if it's deep earpiece.
8169.44 I think there are ways
that they look for that.
8172.14 Certainly any kind
of vibrational device
8174.27 in whatever orifice provided
someone could pay attention
8177.54 to that while still
playing the game.
8180.22 Yeah, I think it's
entirely possible.
8181.95 Now, could it be
done purely neurally?
8184.905 Could there be
something that was--
8187.02 and listen, it wouldn't have
to even be below the skull.
8189.37 This is where whenever people
hear about Neuralink or brain
8191.97 machine interface
they always think,
8193.08 oh, you have to drill
down below the skull
8194.83 and put a chip below
into the skull.
8196.65 I think there are people
walking around nowadays
8198.65 with glucose monitoring devices,
like Levels-- which I've used
8201.389 and it was very informative
for me, actually,
8204.299 as a kind of an experiment.
8205.59 Gave me a lot of interesting
insights about my blood sugar
8208.027 regulation, how it reacts to
different foods, et cetera.
8210.36 Well, you can implant
a tactile device
8215.28 below the skin with
a simple incision.
8217.95 Actually, one of the
neurosurgeons at Neuralink
8219.93 I know well because he
came up at some point
8222.65 through my laboratory
and was at Stanford,
8224.4 and he actually has put in a
radio receiver in his hand,
8227.45 and his wife has it too.
8228.45 And he can open locks
of his house and things
8230.878 like that, so he's been doing--
8232.17 LEX FRIDMAN: Under the skin?
8232.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Under the skin.
8233.76 You can go to--
8234.69 LEX FRIDMAN: How does that work?
8235.18 So how do you use--
8235.68 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A piercer.
8236.805 You go to a body
piercer type person
8239.735 and they can just
slide it under there,
8241.36 and it's got a battery
life of something
8243.61 and some fairly long duration.
8245.299 LEX FRIDMAN: How do you
experience the tactile--
8247.299 the haptics of it?
8248.25 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no.
8248.52 That just allows him to
open certain locks with just
8250.74 his hand, but you could easily
put some sort of tactile device
8254.309 in there.
8255.18 LEX FRIDMAN: But does it
have to connect to the nerves
8257.43 or is it just like--
just vibration?
8259.379 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
No, just vibration.
8260.32 LEX FRIDMAN: And
you can probably
8261.209 sense it even if it's
under the skin, I wonder.
8263.01 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it can be by-- it
8263.85 can be Bluetooth linked.
8264.959 I mean, I've seen--
there's an Engineering
8267.54 Laboratory at the University
of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana,
8270.87 that's got an amazing
device which is
8272.632 about the size of a Band-Aid.
8273.84 It goes on the
clavicles and it uses
8276.99 sound waves pinged into the
body to measure cavitation.
8280.379 Think about this for a moment.
8282.219 This is being used in
the military where,
8284.16 let's say, you're leading
an operation or something.
8287.129 People are getting shot,
shot at, and on a laptop
8289.87 you can see where the
bullet entry points are.
8292.552 Are people dead?
8293.219 Are they bleeding out?
8294.95 Entry, exit points.
8296.67 You can get-- take it out
of the battlefield scenario.
8299.82 You can get breathing, body
position 24 hours a day.
8303.299 There's so much that you can
do looking at cavitation.
8305.549 So these same sorts of
devices on 12 hour Bluetooth
8309.27 could be used to send
all sorts of signals.
8312.36 Maybe every time you're
supposed to hold your hand--
8315.059 I'm not a good gambler
so I only play roulette
8317.73 when I go to Vegas because
you just long, boring games,
8321.433 but you get some good mileage
out of each out of each run,
8323.85 usually.
8324.389 But maybe every time
you're supposed to hold,
8329.07 the person gets a
stomach cinching
8331.559 because this is stimulating
the vagus a little bit
8334.2 and they get a little
bit of an ache.
8335.742 So it doesn't have
to be Morse code.
8337.77 It can be yes, no, maybe.
8339.959 Right?
8341.06 It can be green, red,
yellow type signaling.
8344.245 It doesn't have to be very
sophisticated to give somebody
8346.62 a significant advantage.
8348.45 Anyway, I haven't thought
about this in detail
8350.4 before this conversation
but, oh, yeah,
8352.29 there's an immense landscape.
8353.498 LEX FRIDMAN: I don't
know if you know
8355.04 a poker player named Phil Ivey?
8356.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, I don't
follow the gambling thing.
8359.19 LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
he's considered
8360.12 to be one of the
greatest poker players
8361.745 of all time legitimately.
8363.447 He's just incredibly good.
8364.53 But he got-- there's
this big case where
8369.12 he was accused of
cheating and prove--
8372.284 and it's not really
cheating, which
8373.86 is what's really fascinating.
8375.45 Is it turns out--
8378.54 so he plays poker.
8379.68 Texas Hold'em, mostly,
but all kinds of poker.
8381.959 It turns out that the grid
on the back of the cards
8385.95 is often printed a
little bit imperfectly,
8389.6 and so you can use the
asymmetry of the imperfections
8395.09 to try to figure
out certain cards.
8396.83 So if you play and you remember
that a certain card is, like--
8401.06 I think the 8 in that deck that
he was accused of-- an 8 and 9
8405.08 were slightly different
symmetry wise.
8408.65 So he can now ask
the dealer actually
8412.58 to rotate it to
check the symmetry.
8414.17 So you would ask the dealer
to rotate the card to see that
8417.17 there's-- to detect the
asymmetry of the back
8419.24 of the card, and now he
knows which cards are
8422.12 8's and 9's or likelier to be
8's and 9's, and he was using
8426.8 that information to play
poker and win a lot of money.
8431.45 But it's just a
slight advantage.
8433.4 And his case is-- and
in fact, the judge
8437.0 found this, that he's
not actually cheating,
8439.1 but it's not right.
8440.42 You can't use this kind
of extra information.
8442.83 So it's fascinating that you
can discover these little holes
8445.43 in games if you pay
close enough attention.
8447.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
8448.36 It's fascinating.
8449.55 And I think that I
did watch that clip
8453.35 about the potential of a
cheating event in chess,
8456.05 and the fact that a
number of chess players
8458.93 admit to cheating at some
point in their career.
8461.84 Very, very interesting.
8463.015 LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
it was online.
8464.39 So online cheating
is easier, right?
8467.18 When you're playing
online cheating
8469.4 in a game where the machine
is much better than the human,
8472.04 it's very difficult to
prove that you're human.
8474.32 And that applies, by the
way, another really big thing
8476.9 is in social media, the bots.
8479.193 If you're running a
social media company
8480.86 you have to deal with the
bots and they become--
8483.68 one of the really
exciting things
8485.39 in machine learning and
artificial intelligence, to me,
8488.0 is the very fast improvement
of language models.
8491.72 So neural networks
that generate text,
8494.17 that interpret text, that
generate from text, images
8497.195 and all that kind of stuff.
8498.32 But you're now going to
create incredible bots that
8504.08 look awfully a lot like humans.
8505.97 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, at least they're
8506.54 not going to be those
crypto bots that
8507.98 seem to populate my comment
section when I post anything
8510.378 on Instagram.
8510.92 I actually delete those
even though they add
8512.753 to the comment roster and if--
8516.71 they bother me so much.
8519.41 I spend at least 10, 15 minutes
on each post just deleting
8522.06 those.
8522.56 I don't know what
they need to do
8523.935 but I'm not interested
in those, whatever
8527.39 it is they're offering.
8529.94 Speaking of nonbots,
I'm going to assume
8531.68 that all the questions
are not from bots.
8533.72 There are a lot of
questions here--
8535.46 more than 10,000 questions.
8537.05 Goodness.
8537.95 I'll just take a few,
working from top to bottom.
8546.52 What ideas have you been
wrestling with lately?
8549.16 And I think about
the company as one,
8551.35 but as I scroll to the
next, what are some others?
8554.995 LEX FRIDMAN: Well, some of
the things we've talked about,
8557.37 which is the ideas of how
to understand what is true,
8568.46 what is true about a human
being, how to reveal that,
8570.89 how to reveal that
through conversation, how
8572.84 to challenge that
properly, that it leads
8576.2 to understanding not derision.
8577.79 So that applies to
everybody from Donald Trump
8580.16 to Vladimir Putin.
8585.11 Also another idea is there's
a deep distrust of science
8588.98 in trying to understand-- the
growing distrust of science,
8591.68 trying to understand what's
the role of those of us
8595.22 that have a foot in the
scientific community,
8600.14 how to regain some
of that trust.
8604.7 Also, there's-- as we talked
about, how to find and how to--
8612.78 yeah, how to find and how to
maintain a good relationship.
8615.51 I mean, that's really been--
8617.085 I've never felt
quite as lonely as I
8619.53 have this year with Ukraine.
8621.78 It's just like, so many
times I would just lay there
8625.8 and just feeling so deeply alone
because I felt that my home--
8631.26 not my home literally
because I'm an American.
8634.5 I'm a proud American.
8635.7 I'll die an American.
8637.02 But my home in the
sense of generationally,
8640.08 my family's home, is now going--
8644.7 has been changed forever.
8647.01 There's no more being proud of
being from the former Russia
8652.61 or Ukraine.
8654.23 It's now a political
message to say--
8657.68 to show your pride, and so
it's been extremely lonely.
8660.38 And within that world, with
all the things I'm pursuing,
8663.26 how do you find a
successful relationship?
8665.01 It has been tough.
8666.26 But obviously-- and
there's a huge number
8668.15 of technical ideas
with the startup of,
8669.98 like, how the hell do
you make this thing work?
8672.72 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
the relationship topic
8674.76 is one we talked a
little bit about,
8676.45 and last time we touched on
in a little bit more detail.
8680.35 We're going to come back to
that, so I've made a note here.
8685.26 What or who inspired
Lex, you, to wear
8688.71 a suit every time you podcast?
8690.39 That's a good question.
8691.54 I don't know the answer to that.
8694.49 LEX FRIDMAN: So there's two
answers to that question.
8697.34 One is a suit and two is
a black suit and black tie
8703.0 because I used to do--
8705.29 I used to have more variety,
which is like it was always
8708.363 a black suit but
I would sometimes
8709.78 do a red tie and a blue tie.
8712.48 But that was mostly me
trying to fit in to society
8714.82 because varieties-- you're
supposed to have some variety.
8718.525 What inspired me at first
was a general culture
8726.058 that doesn't take
itself seriously
8728.08 in terms of how you present
yourself to the world.
8730.76 So in academia,
in the tech world,
8732.97 at Google, everybody was wearing
pajamas and very relaxed.
8737.57 In the tech.
8738.107 I don't know how it
is in the science,
8739.69 in the chemistry,
biology, and so on.
8741.83 But in computer science
everybody was very--
8747.12 I mean, very relaxed in
terms of the stuff they
8750.72 wear so I wanted to try
to really take myself
8753.54 seriously and take every
single moment seriously
8755.88 and everything I do
seriously, and the suit
8758.16 made me feel that way.
8759.34 I don't know how it looks,
but it made me feel that way.
8761.92 And I think, in terms
of people I look up
8763.77 to that wore a suit that made
me think of that is probably
8767.13 Richard Feynman.
8768.96 I see--
8769.49 ANDREW HUBERMAN: He was
a wonderful human being.
8771.49 LEX FRIDMAN: I see him as the
epitome of class and humor
8775.41 and brilliance, and
obviously I could never
8779.91 come close to that kind of--
8784.24 be able to simply explain
really complicated ideas
8787.54 and to have humor and wit,
but definitely aspire to that.
8791.98 And then there's
just the Mad Men,
8794.89 that whole era of the '50s,
the classiness of that.
8797.68 There's something
about a suit that
8801.25 both removes the importance
of fashion from the character.
8805.18 You see the person.
8806.32 I think not to--
8810.8 I forgot who said this.
8811.76 Might be, like, Coco Chanel
or somebody like this.
8814.55 Is that you wear a shabby dress
and everyone sees the dress.
8822.86 You wear a beautiful dress
and everybody sees the woman.
8827.6 So in that sense it was--
8830.36 hopefully I'm quoting
that correctly, but--
8832.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good.
8834.1 LEX FRIDMAN: I think
there's a sense in which
8837.14 a simple, classy suit
allows people to focus
8842.81 on your character and then do
so with the full responsibility
8846.41 of that, this is who I am.
8848.85 Yeah.
8849.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love
that, and I love what
8851.225 you said just prior to that.
8852.41 My father, who, again,
is always asking me
8854.84 why I don't dress formally
like you do always
8859.28 said to me growing
up, if you overdress
8861.98 slightly, at least people know
that you took them seriously.
8866.18 So it's a sign of respect for
your audience too in my eyes.
8870.53 Someone asked, is there an AI
equivalent of psychedelics?
8875.51 And I'm assuming they
mean is there something
8878.78 that machines can do
for themselves in order
8881.63 to alter their neural circuitry
through unconventional
8885.08 activation patterns.
8887.06 LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously.
8888.89 Well, I don't know exactly
how psychedelics work,
8891.59 but you can see that with
all the diffusion models
8896.48 now with Dali and the
stable diffusion that
8899.18 generates from text, art.
8904.3 It's basically a small
injection of noise
8908.29 into a system that has
a deep representation
8911.17 of visual information.
8914.3 So it is able to convert text to
art in introducing uncertainty
8919.96 into that noise into that.
8922.33 That's kind of maybe.
8923.762 I could see that as a
parallel to psychedelics,
8925.72 and it's able to create
some incredible things.
8928.405 From a conceptual
understanding of a thing,
8931.78 it can create incredible
art that no human, I think,
8936.25 could have at least
easily created
8938.29 through a bit of
introduction of randomness.
8941.05 Randomness does a lot of work
in the machine learning world.
8945.03 Just enough.
8946.74 ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are
a lot of requests of you
8951.6 for relationship,
a lot of requests
8954.0 about statistics about you,
data about you specifically.
8958.89 Flipping past those,
what was the hardest belt
8963.45 to achieve in jujitsu?
8964.5 I would have assumed
the black belt,
8966.0 but is that actually true?
8968.963 LEX FRIDMAN: No.
8969.63 I mean, everybody has
a different journey
8971.338 through jujitsu, as people know.
8973.71 For me, the black belt
was the ceremonial belt,
8978.78 which is not usually the case,
because I fought the wars.
8984.48 I trained twice a day for I
don't know how many years--
8987.73 seven, eight years.
8988.8 I competed nonstop.
8991.02 I competed against people
much better than me.
8993.24 I competed against many
and beaten many black belts
8996.36 and brown belts.
8998.1 I think, for me personally,
the hardest belt
9004.16 was the brown belt because,
for people who know jujitsu,
9010.76 the size of tournament divisions
for blue belts and purple belts
9016.07 is just humongous.
9017.51 Like Worlds, when I competed
at Worlds it was, like,
9019.82 140 people in a division,
which means you have to win--
9022.982 I forget how many times,
but seven, eight, nine times
9025.19 in a row to medal.
9028.01 And so I just had to put in a
lot of work during that time.
9033.62 And especially for competitors,
instructors usually
9036.68 really make you earn a belt.
So to earn the purple belt was
9040.97 extremely difficult.
Extremely difficult. And then
9043.16 to earn the brown
belt means I had
9044.66 to compete nonstop against other
purple belts, which are young.
9048.5 You're talking about-- the
people that usually compete
9051.56 are, like, 23, 24,
25-year-olds that are shredded,
9055.61 incredible cardio.
9057.18 They can, for some reason, are
in their life where they can--
9059.87 no kids, nothing.
9061.01 They can dedicate
everything to this pursuit
9063.51 so they're training two,
three, four times a day.
9065.75 Diet is on point.
9067.56 You're going-- and for me,
because they're usually bigger
9072.92 and taller than me and
just more aggressive,
9075.26 actual good athletes, yeah, I
had to go through a lot of wars
9078.5 to earn that brown
belt. But then--
9080.25 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got to
try this jujitsu thing.
9081.68 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, you should.
9082.58 But it's a different--
9083.51 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, I tried it.
9084.927 I did the one class, but I
really want to embrace it.
9087.71 LEX FRIDMAN: As you know,
many pursuits like jujitsu
9091.1 are different if you're doing it
in your 20s and 30s and later.
9093.83 It's like it's a different--
9096.38 you're not-- you can have a
bit of an ego in your 20s.
9099.2 You can have that
fire under you,
9100.64 but you should be more
zenlike and wise and patient
9107.0 later in life.
9108.15 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, one would hope.
9110.96 That's the wisdom.
9112.31 LEX FRIDMAN: I think
Rogan is still a meathead.
9114.38 He still goes hard and
crazy and he's still
9116.93 super competitive on
that, so some people can--
9119.21 Jocko is somebody like that.
9120.555 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, whatever they're
9122.18 doing they're doing something
right because they're still
9124.555 in it, and that's
super impressive.
9127.64 There were far too many
questions to ask all of them,
9131.58 but several, if not many, asked
a highly appropriate question
9136.76 for where we are in the
arc of this discussion.
9139.4 And this is one, admittedly,
that you ask in your podcast
9144.08 all the time, but I
get the great pleasure
9146.33 of being in the question
asker seat today.
9150.75 And so, what is your
advice to young people?
9158.22 LEX FRIDMAN: So I just
gave a lecture at MIT
9160.07 and the amount of love I
got there is incredible.
9166.12 And so of course, who
you're talking to is usually
9169.36 undergrads, maybe young
graduate students, and so there
9173.29 one person did ask for advice
as a question at the end.
9176.86 I did a bunch of Q&A. So my
answer was that the world will
9182.23 tell you to find a work-life
balance, to explore,
9190.9 to try to--
9196.36 try different fields
to see what you really
9198.61 connect with, variety,
general education, all
9202.72 that kind of stuff.
9204.35 And I said in your
20s I think you
9206.44 should find one thing
you're passionate about
9209.71 and work harder at that than
you worked at anything else
9213.25 in your life.
9214.34 And if it destroys
you, it destroys you.
9216.97 That's advice for in your 20s.
9219.37 I don't know how universally
true that advice is,
9224.11 but I think at least
give that a chance.
9226.51 Sacrifice, real sacrifice
towards a thing you
9230.38 really care about,
and work your ass off.
9232.54 That said, I've
met so many people,
9235.24 and I'm starting to
think that advice is best
9238.72 applied or best tried in
the engineer disciplines,
9242.42 especially programming.
9244.85 I think there's a bunch of
disciplines in which you
9247.67 can achieve success
with much fewer hours,
9249.86 and it's much more
important to actually
9252.62 have a clarity of
thinking and great ideas
9255.95 and have an energetic mind.
9257.9 The grind in certain disciplines
does not produce great work.
9261.77 I just know that in computer
science and programming
9264.95 it often does.
9265.91 Some of the best people ever
that have built systems,
9269.45 have programmed systems are
usually like the John Carmack
9272.99 kind of people that drink
soda, eat pizza, and program
9276.95 18 hours a day.
9278.64 So I don't know actually.
9281.0 You have to, I think, really
go discipline specific.
9284.78 So my advice applies
to my own life
9286.77 which has been mostly
spent behind that computer,
9289.61 and for that you really, really
have to put in the hours.
9293.69 And what that means
is essentially
9295.16 it feels like a grind.
9297.53 I do recommend that you should
at least try it in your own.
9301.4 That if you interview some of
the most accomplished people
9305.84 ever, I think if
they're honest with you
9308.9 they're going to
talk about their 20s
9312.53 as a journey of a lot of pain
and a lot of really hard work.
9315.95 I think what really
happens, unfortunately,
9319.32 is a lot of those successful
people later in life
9321.8 will talk about
work-life balance.
9323.84 They'll say, you
know what I learned
9325.52 from that process is that it's
really important to get, like,
9331.07 sun in the morning,
to have health,
9333.005 to have good relationships.
9334.13 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire a chef.
9335.01 LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, a chef.
9335.75 Exactly.
9336.47 But I think you have
forgot-- those people have
9340.37 forgotten the value
of the journey they
9343.82 took to that lesson.
9345.41 I think work-life balance is
best learned the hard way.
9350.5 My own perspective.
9352.27 There are certain things you
can only learn the hard way,
9354.8 and so you should learn
that the hard way.
9357.01 Yeah, so that's
definitely advice.
9358.75 And I should say that I
admire people that work hard.
9364.9 If you want to get
on my good side,
9367.718 I think there are the
people that give everything
9369.76 they got towards something.
9371.2 It doesn't actually
matter what it
9372.617 is, but towards achieving
excellence in a thing.
9378.862 That's the highest thing that
we can reach for as human beings
9383.98 I think is excellence
at a thing.
9387.1 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.
9388.44 Well, speaking of
excellent at a thing.
9390.81 Whether or not it's teaching
at MIT or the podcast
9394.17 or the company that
resides in the near future
9399.147 that you create--
9402.63 once again, I'm speaking for
an enormous number of people
9405.12 that excellence and hard
work, certainly, are woven
9409.35 through everything that you do.
9411.33 Every time I sit down with
you I begin and finish
9414.57 with such an immense feeling
of joy and appreciation
9418.62 and gratitude, and it wouldn't
be a Lex Fridman podcast,
9424.8 or in case of Lex even
being a guest on a podcast,
9428.64 if the word love weren't
mentioned at least 10 times.
9431.58 So the feelings of gratitude
for all the work you do,
9436.47 for taking the time here today
to share with us what you're
9439.59 doing, your thoughts,
your insights, what
9442.53 you're perplexed about and what
drives you and your callings.
9445.948 LEX FRIDMAN: Can I read a poem?
9447.24 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please.
9449.73 He was trying to
cut me off post.
9451.11 That was getting a little long.
9452.64 LEX FRIDMAN: No.
9453.307 No, no, no.
9454.272 I was thinking
about this recently.
9455.73 It's one of my favorite
Robert Frost poems, and I--
9460.155 because I wrote several
essays on it, as you do,
9462.57 because I think it's a
popular one that's read.
9465.99 Essays being, like, trying
to interpret poetry,
9468.39 and it's one that
sticks with me.
9470.99 I mean, both its calm beauty,
but in the seriousness
9475.14 of what it means because I
ultimately think it's the--
9480.12 so "Stopping by a Woods
on a Snowy Evening."
9482.55 I think it's ultimately
a human being, a man,
9485.61 asking the old Sisyphus, the
old Camus question of, why live?
9492.57 I think this poem,
even though it
9495.15 doesn't seem like it is a
question of a man contending
9498.81 with suicide and
choosing to live.
9504.07 Whose woods these
are, I think I know.
9506.62 His house is in the
village, though.
9508.69 He will not see me stopping
here to watch his woods fill up
9512.11 with snow.
9513.31 My little horse
must think it queer
9515.8 to stop without a farmhouse near
between the woods and frozen
9519.64 lake, the darkest
evening of the year.
9522.47 He gives this
harness bells a shake
9524.66 to ask if there's some mistake.
9527.07 The only other sound's the sweep
of easy wind and downy flake.
9532.04 The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep,
9535.19 but I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep,
9540.24 and miles to go before I sleep.
9543.53 The woods representing
the darkness,
9546.05 the comfort of the woods
representing death,
9548.12 and he's a man choosing to live.
9551.84 Yeah, I think about that often,
especially my darker moments
9555.82 is you have promises to keep.
9562.45 Thank you for having me, Andrew.
9564.67 You're a beautiful human being.
9566.537 I love you, brother.
9567.37 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
love you, brother.

9608.35 During today's episode we
did not discuss supplements,
9610.87 but on many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab podcast
9613.75 we do discuss supplements
because while supplements
9616.54 aren't necessarily
for everybody,
9617.98 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
9620.17 for things like enhancing
sleep and focus and hormone
9622.72 augmentation and so forth.
9624.137 The Huberman Lab
podcast has partnered
9625.72 with Momentous
Supplements because they
9627.82 are of the very highest quality
and they ship internationally.
9631.45 In addition to that, they have
single ingredient formulations
9634.33 that allow you to devise the
supplement regimen that's
9637.18 most effective and most
cost effective for you.
9639.553 If you'd like to see the
supplements discussed
9641.47 on the Huberman Lab
podcast, please go

sites I provide
9680.26 science and science related
tools for mental health,
9682.682 physical health, and
performance, some of which
9684.64 overlap with information covered
on the Huberman Lab podcast,
9687.52 but often which is distinct
from information covered
9690.28 on the Huberman Lab podcast.
9691.51 So again, that's @hubermanlab
