0.36 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.89 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
6.114 [upbeat music]
9.15 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.24 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.35 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.31 Today, we are going to discuss light
17.22 and the many powerful uses of
light to optimize our health.
20.92 We're going to discuss the use of light
22.73 for optimizing skin health,
appearance, and longevity,
26.31 for wound healing, for
optimizing hormone balance,
29.69 and for regulating sleep, alertness, mood,
32.73 and even for offsetting dementia.
35.03 One of the reasons why light
has such powerful effects
37.58 on so many different
aspects of our biology
40.27 is that it can be translated
into electrical signals
43.85 in our brain and body,
45.14 into hormone signals
in our brain and body,
47.66 and indeed into what we call
49.42 cascades of biological pathways,
51.61 meaning light can
actually change the genes
54.77 that the cells of your bodies express.
56.72 And that is true throughout the lifespan.
59.17 Today, I will discuss the mechanisms
60.8 by which all of that occurs.
62.66 I promise to make it
clear for those of you
64.52 that don't have a biology background.
66.4 And if you do have a biology background,
68.35 I'll try and provide sufficient depth
70.12 so that it's still of interest to you.
72.07 And I promise to give you tools,
74.3 very specific protocols that are extracted
76.27 from the peer-reviewed literature
77.67 that will allow you to use
different so-called wave lengths,
80.69 which most of us think of as colors,
82.77 of light in order to modulate your health
85.67 in the ways that are
most important to you.
88.03 For those of you that are thinking
89.01 that the use of light to modulate health
90.85 falls under the category of woo science,
92.72 pseudoscience, or biohacking,
95.17 well, nothing could be
further from the truth.
97.86 In fact, in 1903, the Nobel
Prize was given to Niels Finsen,
102.36 he was Icelandic, he lived in Denmark,
104.75 for the use of phototherapy
for the treatment of lupus.
108.85 So there's more than a hundred
years of quality science
112.18 emphasizing the use of light,
114.72 and as you'll soon see, the
use of particular wavelengths
118.42 or colors of light in order
to modulate the activity
121.92 of cells in the brain and body.
124.2 So while it is the case that
many places and companies
128.06 are selling therapies and products
130.41 related to the use of flashing
lights and colored lights,
134.56 promising specific
outcomes from everything
137.26 from stem cell renewal to
improvement of brain function,
141.08 and some of those don't
have any basis in science,
144.46 there are photo therapies that
do have a strong foundation
148.53 in quality science,
149.53 and those are the
studies and the protocols
151.53 that we are going to discuss today.
153.27 But I thought that people
might appreciate knowing that
156.29 over a hundred years ago,
157.42 people were thinking
about the use of light
159.2 for the treatment of various diseases
160.67 and for improving health.
161.81 And indeed many of those
therapies are used today
165.13 in high quality hospitals
and research institutions
168.57 and, of course, clinics
and homes around the world.
171.15 One of the more exciting
examples of phototherapy
173.25 in the last few years
174.54 is the beautiful work of Dr. Glen Jeffery
176.52 at University College London.
178.26 The Jeffery Lab is known
for doing pioneering
180.3 and very rigorous research
181.38 in the realm of visual neuroscience.
183.45 And in the last decade or so,
184.71 they turned their attention
to exploring the role
187.02 of red light therapy for
offsetting age-related vision loss.
191.78 What they discovered is
that just brief exposures
195.1 to red light early in the day
197.0 can offset much of the vision loss
198.96 that occurs in people 40 years or older.
201.89 And what's remarkable about these studies
203.81 is that the entire duration of the therapy
206.59 is just one to three minutes,
208.01 done just a few times per week.
210.13 What's even more exciting
211.4 is that they understand the mechanism
213.01 by which this occurred.
215.0 The cells in the back of the eye
216.3 that convert light information
into electrical signals
219.23 that the rest of the brain can understand
221.05 and create visual images from,
222.84 well, those cells are
extremely metabolically active.
226.06 They need a lot of ATP or energy.
229.87 And as we age,
231.39 those cells get less efficient
233.57 at creating that ATP and energy.
236.37 Exposure to red light early in the day,
238.99 and it does have to be early in the day,
241.09 allowed those cells to
replenish the mechanisms
243.96 by which they create ATP.
245.98 I'll talk about these experiments
247.7 in more detail later in the episode
249.36 and the protocols so that you
could apply those protocols
252.01 should you choose.
253.13 But I use this as an example
of our growing understanding
257.75 of not just that phototherapies
work but how they work.
262.03 And it is through the linking
of protocols and mechanism
265.87 that we, meaning all of us,
268.14 can start to apply phototherapies
269.67 in a rational, safe, and powerful way.
272.45 I'm pleased to announce
273.283 that I'm hosting two live events this May.
276.11 The first live event will be hosted
277.63 in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
280.31 The second live event will be hosted
281.93 in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
284.31 Both are part of a lecture series entitled
286.31 The Brain Body Contract,
287.9 during which I will discuss
science and science-based tools
290.94 for mental health, physical
health, and performance.
293.61 And I should point out
294.63 that while some of the material I'll cover
296.84 will overlap with information covered here
298.69 on the Huberman Lab Podcast
300.107 and on various social media posts,
302.14 most of the information I will
cover is going to be distinct
305.31 from information covered on
the podcast or elsewhere.
308.2 So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,
310.73 Portland on May 18th.
312.09 You can access tickets by
going to hubermanlab.com/tour.
316.18 And I hope to see you there.
317.64 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
319.32 that this podcast is separate
320.69 from my teaching and
research roles at Stanford.
323.01 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
325.1 to bring zero cost to consumer information
327.01 about science and science-related tools
329.14 to the general public.
330.51 In keeping with that theme,
331.66 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
334.44 Our first sponsor is Athletic
Greens, also called AG1.
338.35 I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,
341.29 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
343.71 The reason I started taking AG1
345.39 and the reason I still take
AG1 once or twice a day
348.44 is that it covers my foundational
350.24 vitamin, mineral, and probiotic needs.
352.54 It also has adaptogens
and things like zinc
354.99 for immune system function,
356.7 but the probiotics are one
of the key features in there.
359.47 I've done several podcasts
on the gut microbiome,
361.79 which are these trillions of microbiota
363.63 that live in our digestive tract,
365.11 and that are crucial
for our immune system,
367.09 brain function, and so on.
369.44 One way to enhance our gut microbiome
371.68 to ensure that it's healthy
372.9 is to make sure that we
get the correct probiotics.
375.6 And Athletic Greens has
the correct prebiotics
378.33 and probiotics that ensure
a healthy gut microbiome.
381.64 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
383.09 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
385.89 to claim a special offer.
387.23 They'll give you five free travel packs
388.76 that make it very easy
to mix up Athletic Greens
390.81 while you're on the road,
391.68 so in the car and on the plane.
393.17 I should mention the
Athletic Greens is delicious.
395.1 I love the way it tastes.
395.933 I mix mine with some water
396.99 and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
398.51 This special offer is the
five free travel packs
400.71 plus a year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.
403.61 Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important
405.64 for a tremendous number
of biological functions.
408.13 Many of us who get sunlight
get enough vitamin D3.
411.53 Many of us, even if we do get sunlight,
413.61 do not get enough Vitamin D3.
415.54 So the year's supply of
vitamin D3 also has K2,
418.56 which is important for
cardiovascular function
420.44 for calcium regulation.
422.09 Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
424.76 to get the five free travel packs
426.11 and the year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.
428.68 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Thesis.
431.24 Thesis makes custom nootropics.
433.59 Nootropic is a smart drug.
435.7 And personally, I'm not a big fan
437.52 of the concept of a smart drug,
439.31 at least not the way that most people talk
441.12 about smart drugs or nootropics,
for the following reason.
445.43 Being smart involves various things.
447.61 There is creativity, there's focus,
449.61 there's task switching, and so on.
451.58 And each one of those
involves different operations
453.9 in the brain.
454.733 Different neural circuits,
different neurochemicals
456.51 have to be deployed in order for us to,
458.97 for instance, be very focused
or for us to be very creative
462.14 or for us to be able
to switch tasks easily.
465.41 Thesis understands this.
466.75 And for that reason, they've
developed custom nootropics
470.09 that are aimed at getting
your brain and body
472.6 into particular states for
particular types of work
476.39 or physical activity.
477.97 In order to accomplish that,
they've created unique blends
480.49 of high quality ingredients.
481.72 And each of those blends is designed
483.5 to get your brain and body
into a particular mode,
485.69 such as focus, clarity, or motivation.
488.28 I've been using Thesis nootropics
for over six months now.
491.34 And I have to say it's
been a total game changer
493.38 and very unique from the experience
495.32 of using sort of what I
call catchall nootropics.
498.15 So with Thesis, it's really directed
499.92 toward particular brain-body states.
501.99 I should also mention
502.823 that they tailor those
custom blends to you.
505.15 So by taking a quiz on their site,
506.95 they will tailor the blend to
you and your specific needs
509.3 and the things you don't want.
510.66 So if you want to try
your own personalized
512.36 nootropic starter kit,
513.25 you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.
516.89 You'll take a three-minute quiz,
518.14 and Thesis will send you
four different formulas
520.18 to try in your first month.
521.41 And then based on the outcomes with those,
523.41 they can update your formulations for you.
525.52 That's takethesis.com/huberman

531.21 Today's episode is also
brought to us by LMNT.
533.8 LMNT is a properly
balanced electrolyte drink
536.37 that has no sugar.
538.37 When we get our electrolytes
in the proper ratios,
540.86 the cells of our brain and
body can function optimally.
543.53 Many people are surprised to find
545.09 that when they increase
their sodium intake,
547.16 provided that it is a proper balance
549.13 with potassium and magnesium,
550.67 they can think more clearly,
552.07 they recover from exercise better,
553.59 and they have more energy.
555.28 There is no surprise as to
how that all works, however.
558.52 Every cell of your body requires
559.89 the electrolytes to function.
561.21 And in particular, the
neurons of your brain and body
563.49 require sodium in order to function.
565.81 So while people with
pre-hypertension and hypertension
568.87 definitely need to be careful
570.17 about increasing their sodium intake,
571.95 many people do well to
increase their sodium intake,
574.82 again, provided it's in the proper balance
577.05 with potassium and magnesium.
578.86 LMNT provides that proper balance.
581.28 If you'd like to try LMNT,
582.53 you can go to drinklmnt,
583.9 that's L-M-N-T,

596.49 Okay, let's talk about light.
597.9 First, I want to talk
about the physics of light,
600.52 and I promise to make that very clear,
602.01 even if you don't have
a background in physics.
603.8 And then I want to talk
about the biology of light,
606.66 meaning how light is
converted into signals
609.71 that your brain and body can use
611.88 to impact things like
organ health or disease,
615.31 or how it can use light
617.0 in order to repair particular organs,
619.17 like your skin, your eyes,
your brain, et cetera.
622.12 The physics of light
can be made very simple
624.18 by just illustrating a
few key bullet points.
626.88 The first bullet point
628.17 is that light is electromagnetic energy.
631.76 If the word electromagnetic
feels daunting to you,
634.69 well, then just discard that
635.9 and just think of light as energy
638.65 and think of energy as something
640.25 that can impact other
things in its environment.
643.74 Now, the way to imagine light
646.13 or to conceptualize light as energy
648.42 is that all around you light is traveling
650.65 in these little wavelengths.
651.61 And the reason, for those
of you that are watching,
653.23 I'm making a little
wavey motion with my hand
655.05 is that's actually the way
656.01 that light energy moves in little waves.
658.06 Just like sound waves are coming at you
659.79 and impinging on your ears,
661.05 if you can hear me talking right now,
662.15 that is happening,
663.3 those are sound waves,
664.14 meaning the movement of
air particles out there
667.07 impacting your ear drum.
668.23 Well, light energy is just little bits
670.77 of electromagnetic energy
traveling through your environment
674.11 all the time in these little waves
676.77 and impinging on your brain
and body and eyes, et cetera.
680.77 And as I mentioned before,
682.24 energy can change the way
that other things behave.
685.76 It can cause reactions
in cells of your body.
689.23 It can cause reactions in
fruit, for instance, right?
692.04 You see a piece of
fruit and it's not ripe,
694.35 but it gets a lot of
sunlight and it ripens.
696.05 That's because the
electromagnetic energy of sunlight
699.3 had an impact on that plant or that tree,
702.42 or even on the fruit directly.
704.32 As a parallel example of energy
706.21 and its ability to impact other things,
709.41 we are all familiar with food
710.8 and the fact that food has calories.
712.86 Calorie is a measure of energy.
715.46 It has everything to do with
how much heat is generated
718.56 when you burn a particular
article of food,
720.84 believe it or not.
721.87 And it turns out that how hot
a given article of food burns
726.72 gives you a sense of how much energy
728.36 it can provide your body
729.75 in terms of your body's ability
to store or use that energy.
733.96 So again, think of light
as electromagnetic energy,
736.91 but really put that word
energy into capital letters,
741.03 embed that in your mind, going forward,
742.95 and you'll understand most
of the first bullet point
746.6 of what light is in terms
of the physics of light.
749.91 Now, the second thing that
you need to understand
751.9 about the physics of light
753.13 is that light has many
different wavelengths,
755.82 and the simplest way to conceptualize this
757.56 is to imagine that cover
of that Pink Floyd album,
759.72 where there's a prism.
760.79 You have a white beam of
light going into that prism.
763.72 And then the prism
splits that beam of light
766.21 into what looks like a rainbow.
768.13 So you got your reds,
your orange, your greens,
769.69 your blues, your purples, et cetera.
771.87 Anytime we have light in our environment,
774.11 that is so-called white light.
775.77 It includes all those wavelengths,
777.71 but sunlight and other forms of light
780.89 also have other wavelengths
of light that we can't see.
785.05 So when we think about the rainbow,
786.42 that's just the visible spectrum of light.
789.14 There are also wavelengths of light
791.06 that are not visible to us,
792.47 but that are visible
to some other animals,
795.32 and that can still impact
your brain and body
799.17 because there is still
energy at those wavelengths.
802.95 I'll give a few examples of this.
804.99 Humans are not a species that can see
807.46 into the infrared realm of the spectrum.
811.43 A pit viper, meaning a snake
that has infrared sensors,
816.01 however, can sense in the infrared.
818.95 So if you were to walk through a jungle
821.03 and there's a pit viper there,
822.69 it sees you as a cloud of heat emission
826.39 because your body is emitting
infrared energy all the time.
831.23 You're casting off infrared energy.
833.79 The snake can see it, you can't.
835.81 If you were to put on a
particular set of goggles
838.74 that were infrared goggles,
841.24 well, then you would be able
to see the heat emissions
843.62 of any organism, human or otherwise,
846.06 that could emit infrared energy.
849.79 Let's take the opposite
end of the spectrum.
851.98 We are familiar with seeing things
853.35 that are blue or green or very pale blue.
856.38 But as we say below that,
858.78 meaning even shorter
wavelength light is out there.
861.46 Ultraviolet light is a really
good example of light energy
864.95 that's coming from the sun
and is in our environment
866.987 and is being reflected
off surfaces all the time.
869.76 We don't see it.
870.63 And yet, if it's very bright outside,
873.44 that ultraviolet light can burn our skin.
876.32 As you'll learn in today's episode,
878.14 ultraviolet light can
also positively impact us.
882.8 In fact, I will describe a particular set
884.78 of new results that show
that ultraviolet light
888.24 viewed for just a few minutes each day,
891.21 or landing on the skin for
just a few minutes each day,
893.63 can actually offset a lot of pain.
896.49 It actually has the ability
to reduce the amount
899.37 of pain sensed by your body.
900.99 And we now understand the
specific circuits in the brain
903.47 and body that allow that to happen.
905.23 I'll talk about that
906.063 and the related protocols
a little bit later.
908.37 So the important thing to understand
909.56 about the physics of light
910.88 is that there's energy at all
these different wavelengths.
913.35 We only see some of those wavelengths,
915.66 which basically is to
say that light impacts us
919.07 at many different levels.
921.38 And the so-called levels
that I'm referring to
924.03 are the different wavelengths of light.
926.1 And you're welcome to think
927.3 of the different wavelengths
of light as different colors,
929.77 but do understand that there
are truly colors of light
933.29 that you and I can't see,
935.24 and yet that have powerful
impact on your brain and body.
938.49 Now, the third bullet point to understand
940.5 about the physics of light
941.93 is that different wavelengths of light,
944.27 because of the way that
their wave travels,
947.94 can penetrate tissues to different depths.
951.83 This is very, very important.
954.0 Today, we're going to talk a
lot about red light therapies
956.43 and near-infrared light therapies.
959.97 Those are so called longer wavelengths.
962.34 Longer wavelengths, just think
963.32 of a bigger, longer wave, right?
966.38 A bigger curve, as opposed
to short wavelength light,
968.71 which is going to be shorter, right?
970.82 A short wavelength
light would be something
972.21 like blue or green light
or ultraviolet light.
975.67 Blue, green, and ultraviolet light,
977.89 because its shortwave length light,
979.68 doesn't tend to penetrate
tissues very easily.
983.67 It has to do with the way
that the physics of light
985.55 interacts with the physical
properties of your skin
987.82 and other tissues of your body.
989.25 But basically, if you
were to shine UV light
991.28 onto your arm, for instance,
993.03 it could impact the skin
on the surface of the arm,
995.31 maybe some of the cells just
beneath the top layer of skin,
999.02 but it wouldn't penetrate much deeper.
1001.89 Long wavelength light like red
light and near-infrared light
1005.98 has this amazing ability to
penetrate through tissues,
1010.01 including your skin.
1011.32 And so if we were to shine red light
1013.49 or near-infrared light onto your arm,
1017.14 it would pass through
that top layer of skin.
1019.92 It might impact it a little bit,
1021.49 but it could penetrate
deeper into your skin,
1024.82 not just to the skin layers,
1026.03 but maybe even down to the bone,
1027.7 maybe even down to the bone marrow.
1029.57 And for many people, this
will be hard to conceptualize.
1031.86 You think, "Well, wait,
I've got the skin there.
1033.4 Doesn't the light just bounce off?"
1034.84 And the answer is no,
1035.98 because of the way that
long wavelength light
1039.57 interacts with the absorbance
properties of your skin.
1042.89 Absorbance properties are just the way
1044.09 that the skin takes light energy
1046.21 and converts it into a
different form of energy.
1049.33 And your skin is not able to
take long wavelength light,
1052.81 like red light and near-infrared
light, and absorb it.
1056.38 But the tissues deeper in your body can.
1059.67 So if you shine a red light
or near-infrared light
1062.22 onto the surface of your skin,
1063.54 you'll see a red glow there
1065.14 as a reflectance on the
surface of your skin.
1067.47 But a lot of the photon energy,
1069.74 the light energy in
those longer wavelengths
1072.03 is indeed passing through
those top layers of skin,
1074.88 into the deeper layers of skin,
1076.42 and can even make it into
the deep layers of your arm.
1079.66 And as we start to transition
from the physics of light
1081.93 to the biological impacts of light,
1084.87 just understanding that the
different wavelengths of light
1087.42 impact our tissues at different levels,
1089.33 literally at different depths,
1090.98 will help you better understand
1092.89 how light of different colors,
of different intensities
1096.26 and how long you are
exposed to those colors
1099.66 and intensities of light can
change the way that the cells
1103.53 and the organs of your body work.
1105.74 And if it didn't sound weird enough
1107.06 that you can pass light
through particular tissues
1109.84 and have them land and be absorbed
1111.79 at tissues deeper in your body,
1114.51 well, it turns out that
different wavelengths of light
1117.56 are also best absorbed by
particular so-called organelles
1122.52 within your cells.
1123.57 What are organelles?
1124.403 Organelles are the different compartments
1126.28 and different functions
within a given cell.
1128.94 So for instance, your mitochondria,
1130.46 which are responsible for generating ATP
1132.367 and energy in your cells,
1134.95 those exist at a particular depth,
1137.02 at a particular location within a cell.
1138.61 They're not all at the cell surface.
1139.94 They sit somewhat deeper in the cell.
1141.81 The nucleus of your
individual cells contains DNA,
1145.18 and that sits at a
particular depth or location
1147.16 within your cell.
1149.27 Different wavelengths of light
1150.74 not only can penetrate
down into different tissues
1153.52 and into different cells of your body,
1155.64 but they can also penetrate
1157.46 and access particular organelles,
1159.57 meaning mitochondria or the nucleus
1162.22 or the different aspects of your cells
1164.07 that are responsible
for different functions.
1166.45 This is exquisitely important,
and it's exquisitely powerful
1171.38 because as you'll learn today,
1172.83 particular wavelengths
of light can be used
1174.76 to stimulate the function
of particular organelles
1177.21 within particular cells,
1179.04 within particular organs of your body.
1181.58 I can think of no other
form of energy, not sound,
1185.32 not chemical energy, so not drugs,
1187.84 not food, not touch, no form of energy
1193.05 that can target the particular locations
1195.75 in our cells, in our organelles,
1198.72 in our organs and in our body,
1200.77 to the extent that light can.
1202.44 In other words, if you had to imagine
1204.68 a real world surgical tool by
which to modulate our biology,
1209.99 light would be the sharpest
1211.67 and the most precise of those tools.
1213.86 Now, let's talk about
how light is converted
1215.32 into biological signals.
1217.09 There's several ways in
which that is accomplished,
1219.65 but the fundamental thing to understand
1222.22 is this notion of
absorption of light energy.
1226.95 Certain pigments or colors
1230.46 in the thing that is
receiving the light energy,
1233.83 meaning the thing that
the light energy lands on,
1237.41 are going to absorb particular
wavelengths of light.
1240.51 Now, I promise you that you
already intuitively know
1243.37 how this works.
1244.74 For instance, if you were to sit outside
1247.31 on a very bright sunny day,
1249.19 and you had a table in
front of you that was metal,
1252.56 you might find it hard to
look down at that metal table
1255.02 because it's reflecting a lot of light
1256.95 of particular wavelengths.
1259.26 If that table were pitch black, however,
1262.04 it wouldn't reflect quite as much,
1264.57 and you would be able to
comfortably look at at it.
1268.02 If that table were red, it
might be somewhere in between.
1270.9 If that table were green,
1272.87 it would be also somewhere in between,
1274.73 but let's say it were very light blue.
1276.55 Well, then it might reflect
almost as much as a table
1279.76 that were just metal or
a white table surface.
1283.44 So the absorbance properties
of a given surface
1286.46 will determine whether or not
light energy goes and stays
1290.23 at that location and has
an impact on that location
1293.31 or whether or not it bounces off.
1296.37 Every biological function of light
1298.76 has to do with the absorbance
or the reflectance of light
1303.08 or light passing through
that particular thing,
1306.82 meaning that particular cell
or compartment within a cell.
1311.91 I'd like to make it clear how this works
1313.56 by using the three primary examples
1315.87 of how you take light in your environment
1318.96 and convert it into biological events.
1323.08 We have photoreceptors
in the back of our eyes.
1325.99 These photoreceptors
come in two major types,
1328.72 the so-called rods and the cones.
1330.38 The rods are very elongated,
they look like rods.
1333.12 And the cones look like little triangles.
1336.01 Rods and cones have
within them photopigment.
1340.84 They have dark stuff that's
stacked up in little layers.
1344.34 Rods absorb light of
essentially any wavelength.
1347.41 There's some variation to that,
1348.76 but let's just say rods don't care
1352.06 about the different colors of light.
1354.93 They will absorb light
energy, photon energy,
1357.73 if it's red, if it's green, if it's blue,
1360.03 if it's yellow, doesn't matter,
1362.1 as long as that light is bright enough.
1364.21 And it turns out that rods
are very, very sensitive.
1366.53 They can detect very, very
small numbers of photons.
1370.81 And rods are essentially what you use
1373.19 to see in very low light conditions.
1375.43 We'll return more to vision later.
1377.47 The cones come in three major varieties.
1380.95 At least for most people
who aren't colorblind,
1382.99 you have so-called red cones,
green cones, and blue cones.
1385.33 But they're not really
red, green, and blue
1386.85 in the back of your eye.
1387.94 They are cones that either absorb
1390.18 long wavelength light, red,
1393.02 that absorb medium
wavelength light, green,
1396.12 or short wavelength light, blue.
1399.72 The reason that they can absorb
1401.29 different wavelengths of light
1402.64 is they have different photopigments.
1404.77 So much as the example I gave before,
1406.96 where you have different tables outside
1409.63 in the sunny environment,
1410.82 and some are reflecting
light more than others,
1412.7 others are absorbing
light more than others,
1415.5 well, so too, the photoreceptors,
meaning the cones,
1419.31 are absorbing light of
different wavelengths
1422.31 to different extents.
1423.76 And in an absolutely incredible way,
1426.6 your brain is actually able
to take that information
1429.03 and create this perception
that we have of color.
1431.42 But that's another story altogether
1432.87 that we'll just touch on
a little bit more later,
1435.51 but that if you want to learn all about,
1437.07 you can go to our episode on vision.
1441.2 So that's photoreceptors
in the back of your eye,
1443.79 absorbing light of different
wavelengths, rods, and cones.
1447.15 The other place, of course,
1448.21 where light can impact our body
1450.01 is on our surface, on our skin.
1452.67 And skin has pigment too.
1454.67 We call that pigment melanin.
1457.01 We have within our skin
multiple cell types,
1459.89 but in the top layer of skin,
which is called the epidermis,
1463.1 we have keratinocytes,
and we have melanocytes.
1467.4 And the melanocytes are the cells
1469.74 that create pigmentation of the skin.
1471.39 And of course there is wide
variation in the degree
1474.8 to which there is
pigmentation of the skin,
1477.2 which has to do with genetics,
1478.63 also has to do with where
you were born and raised,
1481.14 how much light exposure you
have throughout the year, right?
1483.76 So people toward the equator
1485.04 tend to have more melanocyte activity
1486.94 than people who are
located at the North Pole.
1489.41 And of course, people live
at different locations
1491.3 throughout the Earth,
1492.133 regardless of their genetic background
1493.96 or where they were born.
1494.89 And so, as you all know,
with light exposure,
1498.42 those melanocytes will
turn on genetic programs
1502.6 and other biological programs
1504.41 that lead to enhanced
pigmentation of the skin,
1506.77 which we call tanning.
1508.77 The way they do that is by
absorbing UV light specifically.
1512.75 So with melanocytes,
1514.23 we have a very specific example
1516.63 of how a pigment absorbs
light of a particular length,
1520.33 in this case, ultraviolet
shortwave length light,
1523.25 which in turn creates a
set of biological signals
1526.91 within those cells that
in turn creates changes
1529.59 in our skin pigmentation.
1531.04 So we have photoreceptors,
we have melanocytes.
1533.333 And the third example I'd like to provide
1535.29 is that of every cell of your body.
1537.62 And what I mean by that is
that every cell of your body,
1540.38 meaning a cell that is
part of your bone tissue
1544.59 or your bone marrow or heart
tissue or liver or spleen,
1548.8 if light can access those cells,
1551.56 it will change the way
that those cells function
1553.83 for better or for worse.
1556.54 For many organs within our body
1558.68 that reside deep to our skin,
1562.11 light never arrives at those cells.
1565.36 A really good example of this
1566.69 that we'll touch on later is the spleen.
1569.44 Unless you have massive
damage to your body surface,
1572.59 unless you literally
have a hole in your body,
1574.79 light will never land
directly on your spleen,
1578.1 but the spleen still
responds to light information
1581.8 through indirect pathways.
1584.14 And those indirect pathways arise
1586.42 through light arriving on the skin
1588.23 and light arriving on the eyes.
1590.65 So a key principle
1591.81 that I'm going to return
to again and again today
1594.57 is that the ways in which
light can impact the biology
1598.63 of your organelles, your cells,
1600.64 your organs, and the tissues,
and indeed your whole body,
1603.53 can either be direct,
1605.41 so for instance, light onto
your skin impacting skin
1608.28 or light onto your photoreceptors
1609.83 impacting the photoreceptors of your eye,
1612.1 or it can be indirect.
1613.92 It can be light arriving
on your photoreceptors,
1616.95 the photoreceptors then
informing another cell type,
1619.91 which informs another cell type,
1621.78 which then relays a signal
1623.22 in kind of a bucket brigade manner
1625.62 off to the spleen and says to the spleen,
1627.577 "Hey, there's a lot of UV light out here.
1630.4 We're actually under stress.
1632.11 In fact, there's so much UV light
1633.73 that you need to activate
an immune program
1636.75 to protect the skin."
1638.15 And in response to that,
1639.21 the spleen can deploy certain
signals in certain cell types
1641.96 to go out and start repairing skin
1643.64 that's being damaged by UV light.
1645.44 So we have direct signals
and we have indirect signals,
1648.42 but in every case,
1651.0 it starts with light of
particular wavelengths
1654.31 being absorbed by particular
pigments or properties
1657.92 of the surfaces that
those light waves land on.
1662.33 And as you recall from our discussion
1663.87 about the physics of light, remember,
1665.64 it's not just about light impinging
1667.5 on the surface of your body.
1668.59 Light can actually
penetrate deep to the skin
1671.98 and access at least certain
tissues and cells of your body.
1675.83 Even though you can't see
those wavelengths of light,
1678.43 they are getting into you all the time.
1681.02 So perhaps the best way
to wrap this discussion
1684.11 about the physics and the biology of light
1686.15 with a bit of a bow
1687.85 is to think about light as a transducer,
1691.27 meaning a communicator of what's going on
1693.93 in the environment around you
1695.76 and that some of those signals
are arriving at the surface
1699.15 and impacting the surface of your body.
1701.27 But many of those signals
are being taken by cells
1704.1 at the surface of your body,
1705.83 meaning your melanocytes in your skin
1707.63 and the photoreceptors of your eyes,
1709.48 and then being passed off
as a set of instructions
1713.35 to the other organs and
tissues of your body.
1715.76 Light can impact our biology in very fast,
1718.98 moderately fast, and slow ways.
1721.52 But even the slow ways in which
light can impact our biology
1725.23 can be very powerful
and very long-lasting.
1728.37 Just as a quick example
of the rapid effects
1731.77 of light on our biology,
1733.95 if you were to go from a room
that is dimly lit or dark
1738.36 into a very brightly lit room,
1741.11 you would immediately feel very alert.
1744.6 You might say, "No, that's the not true.
1745.99 Sometimes I wake up and it's
dark, and I kind of stumble out
1749.08 and it's lighter out in the next room.
1751.03 And it takes me a while to wake up."
1752.53 Ah, but if we were to move you from a room
1755.08 that was very dark to very bright,
1757.1 a signal conveyed from your eyes
1759.89 to an area of your brain stem
called the locus coeruleus
1763.17 would cause the release of adrenaline
1765.78 similar to the release of adrenaline
1767.52 if you were to be dropped
into very, very cold water
1770.01 all of a sudden.
1770.91 Just an immediate wake-up
signal to your brain and body.
1773.55 So that's an example of a rapid effect
1775.9 of light on your biology,
1777.55 not a very typical one, but nonetheless,
1779.76 one that has a hardwired
biological mechanism.
1783.53 At the other end of the spectrum
1785.56 are what we call slow
integrating effects of light
1788.49 on our biology.
1789.98 So what I mean by that are
ways in which your body
1793.32 is taking information about
light in the environment,
1796.64 not in the sort of snapshot, acute sense,
1799.76 but averaging the amount of
light in your environment.
1802.54 And that average light information
1805.28 is changing the way
that your biology works.
1807.97 But even though this is a slow process,
1810.65 as I mentioned before,
it's a very powerful one.
1813.49 The primary example of this
1815.53 are so-called circannual rhythms.
1818.34 Circannual rhythms are
literally a calendar
1821.88 that exists within your
body that uses not numbers,
1826.45 but amounts of hormone that are released
1828.87 into your brain and body
each day and each night
1831.87 as a way of knowing where you are
1834.13 in the 365-day calendar year.
1837.56 Now that might seem kind of
crazy, but it's not crazy.
1840.96 The Earth travels around
the sun once every 365 days.
1845.07 And depending on where you are
on the Earth, where you live,
1850.27 you are going to get more or
less light each day on average,
1854.92 depending on the time of year.
1856.56 So if you're in the Northern Hemisphere,
1858.85 in the winter months, days are
shorter, nights are longer.
1862.94 In the summer months, days are
longer, nights are shorter.
1866.04 And of course, things
change whether or not you're
1869.1 in the Northern Hemisphere
or the Southern Hemisphere,
1871.7 but nonetheless in short
days you have more darkness,
1876.64 that's obvious.
1877.88 And if you understand that
light arriving on the eyes
1883.88 is absorbed by a particular cell type
1886.19 called the intrinsically
photosensitive ganglion cell.
1889.05 It's just a name.
1889.883 You don't need to know
the name, but if you want,
1891.19 it's the so-called intrinsically
1892.35 photosensitive ganglion cell,
1893.48 also called the melanopsin cell
1895.33 because it contains an opsin,
1896.81 a photopigment that absorbs
shortwave length light
1901.96 that arrives through sunlight.
1903.73 Those cells communicate to
particular stations in the brain
1907.51 that in turn connect to
your so-called pineal gland,
1911.68 which is this little pea-sized gland
1913.43 in the middle of your brain
1914.7 that releases a hormone called melatonin.
1917.65 And the only thing you
need to know is that light
1920.45 activates these particular cells,
1922.21 the intrinsically
photosensitive melanopsin cells,
1924.55 which in turn shuts down
the production of melatonin
1928.46 from the pineal gland.
1931.02 If you think about this
in terms of the travel
1933.91 of the Earth around the
sun across the year,
1936.98 what it means is that in short days,
1939.6 because there's very
little light on average
1942.08 landing on these cells,
1944.73 the duration of melatonin
release will be much longer
1948.17 because as I mentioned
before, light inhibits,
1950.86 it shuts down melatonin.
1952.58 Whereas in the summer months,
much more light on average
1956.1 will land on your eyes, right?
1957.58 Because days are longer.
1959.01 Even if you're spending more time indoors,
1960.45 on average, you're going to get more light
1963.54 to activate these cells.
1965.16 And because light shuts
down melatonin production,
1968.207 what you'll find is that the
duration of melatonin release
1971.32 for the pineal is much shorter.
1974.42 So melatonin is a transducer.
1977.51 It's a communicator of
how much light on average
1980.63 is in your physical environment.
1983.0 What this means is
1985.09 for people living in
the Northern Hemisphere,
1987.46 you're getting more melatonin
release in the winter months
1990.58 than you are in the summer months.
1992.68 So you have a calendar system
that is based in a hormone,
1998.72 and that hormone is using
light in order to determine
2002.159 where you are in that
journey around the sun.
2006.2 Now, this is beautiful.
2007.1 At least to me, it's beautiful
2008.54 because what it means is that
the environment around us
2011.9 is converted into a signal
2013.87 that changes the environment within us.
2016.9 That signal is melatonin,
2018.82 and melatonin is well known for its role
2021.22 in making us sleepy each night
2022.95 and allowing us to fall asleep.
2024.81 Many of you have probably heard before,
2026.25 I am not a big fan of
melatonin supplementation
2028.93 for a number of reasons,
but just as a quick aside,
2032.2 the levels of melatonin
that are in most supplements
2034.39 are far too high to really
be considered physiological.
2037.52 They are indeed super
physiological in most cases,
2040.21 and melatonin can have a
number of different effects,
2042.96 not just related to sleep,
2045.17 but that's supplemented melatonin.
2047.73 Here, I'm talking about
our natural production
2050.4 and release of melatonin
2051.5 according to where we are in
the 365-day calendar year.
2057.13 Endogenous melatonin,
meaning the melatonin
2059.08 that we make within our bodies naturally,
2060.96 not melatonin that's supplemented,
2063.61 has two general categories of effects.
2066.8 The first set of effects are
so called regulatory effects
2069.18 and the others are protective effects.
2070.94 The regulatory effects are for instance,
2072.83 that melatonin can
positively impact bone mass.
2077.58 So melatonin can, for instance,
2079.35 turn on the production of osteoblasts,
2081.85 which are essentially stem
cells that make more bone for us
2085.87 that make our bones stronger
2087.46 and that can replace
damaged aspects of our bone.
2091.1 Melatonin is also involved in maturation
2093.25 of the gonads during puberty,
the ovaries and the testes.
2096.89 Although there, the effects of melatonin
2098.65 tend to be suppressive on maturation
2101.33 of the ovaries and testes,
2102.82 meaning high levels of melatonin
2104.66 tend to reduce testicle volume
2107.56 and reduce certain
functions within the testes,
2110.92 including sperm production
and testosterone production.
2113.63 And within the ovaries,
melatonin can suppress
2116.73 the maturation of eggs, et cetera.
2118.63 Now, I don't want anyone to get scared
2120.08 if you've been taking melatonin.
2121.59 Most of the effects of melatonin
2122.83 on those functions are reversible,
2125.22 but I should point out
that one of the reasons
2127.31 why children don't go into
puberty until a particular age
2130.67 is that young children
2132.08 tend to have chronically
high endogenous melatonin.
2134.79 And that is healthy to
keep them out of puberty
2137.41 until it's the right time
for puberty to happen.
2140.74 So melatonin can increase bone mass,
2143.44 but reduces gonad mass, so to speak.
2146.89 It's going to have varying effects
2148.77 depending on the ratios and
levels of other hormones
2151.247 and other biological events in the body.
2153.26 But as you can see,
2154.17 melatonin has these powerful
regulatory on other tissues.
2157.57 I should also mention that
melatonin is a powerful modulator
2160.91 of placental development.
2162.16 So for anyone that's pregnant,
2163.52 if you're considering
melatonin supplementation,
2165.88 please, please, please
talk to your OB/GYN,
2168.56 talk to your other doctor as well.
2171.01 You want to be very, very cautious
2172.41 because of the powerful
effects that melatonin can have
2174.69 on the developing fetus and placenta.
2176.95 For people that are not
pregnant, in fact, all people,
2180.05 melatonin has a powerful effect
2182.69 on the central nervous system as a whole.
2184.99 Your brain and spinal cord
are the major components
2187.02 of your central nervous system ,
2188.48 and melatonin, because it's
associated with darkness,
2193.07 which is just another way of saying
2194.24 that light suppresses melatonin,
2195.897 melatonin is thereby
associated with the dark phase
2199.23 of each 24-hour cycle,
2201.84 it can have a number of different effects
2204.75 in terms of waking up or making
our body feel more sleepy.
2208.38 And it does that by way of impacting cells
2210.46 within our nervous system,
2211.49 literally turning on certain brain areas,
2214.09 turning off other brain areas.
2215.62 And it does that through a whole cascade
2217.11 of biological mechanisms,
2218.52 a bit too detailed to get into today.
2220.51 So melatonin is regulating
how awake or asleep we are.
2223.04 It tends to make us more
asleep, incidentally.
2225.98 It's regulating our timing of puberty,
2228.88 and it's regulating how our gonads,
2231.34 the testes and ovaries, function,
2232.94 even in adulthood, to some extent.
2234.83 And it's regulating bone mass.
2237.46 As I mentioned before,
2238.293 melatonin also has protective effects.
2240.51 It can activate our immune system.
2242.21 It is among the most potent antioxidants.
2245.55 So it is known to have
certain anti-cancer properties
2248.18 and things of that sort,
2249.67 which is not to say that you
simply want more melatonin.
2252.17 I think a lot of people get misled
2253.9 when they hear something like,
2255.18 melatonin has anti-cancer properties.
2258.01 That doesn't mean that cranking
up the levels of melatonin
2260.5 by supplementing it, or by
spending time in darkness
2263.67 and not getting any light,
2264.56 which would, of course, inhibit melatonin,
2265.823 is going to be beneficial
for combating cancer.
2268.54 That's not the way it works.
2270.59 It is actually the rise
and fall of melatonin
2274.05 every 24-hour cycle
2275.69 and the changes in the duration
of that melatonin signal
2278.51 throughout the seasons
2279.87 that has these anti-cancer
and antioxidant effects.
2283.34 So when we think about
light impacting our biology,
2287.14 the reason I bring up melatonin
2288.7 as the primary example of that
2290.34 is A, because melatonin impacts
so many important functions
2292.953 within our brain and body,
2294.46 but also because hormones
in general, not always,
2297.87 but in general, are responsible
2299.27 for these slow modulatory
effects on our biology.
2302.73 And so I'm using this as an example
2304.84 of how light throughout the year
2306.78 is changing the way
that the different cells
2309.29 and tissues and organs
of your body are working,
2311.1 and that melatonin is the
transducer of that signal.
2314.34 So at this point,
2315.173 we can say light powerfully
modulates melatonin,
2318.09 meaning it shuts down melatonin.
2319.72 Melatonin is both beneficial
for certain tissues
2322.47 and suppressive for other
tissues and functions.
2326.28 What should we do with this information?
2327.82 Well, it's very well established now
2330.89 that one of the best
things that we can all do
2333.13 is to get the proper amount
of sunlight each day.
2336.63 And by proper, I mean appropriate
for that time of year.
2340.37 So in the summer months
where the days are longer
2343.6 and nights are shorter,
2344.82 we would all do well to get
more sunlight in our eyes.
2348.25 And again, it's going to be to our eyes
2350.14 because as you recall,
2351.98 the pineal sits deep in the brain,
2354.27 and light can't access
the pineal directly,
2356.36 at least not in humans.
2357.87 So in order to get light
information to the pineal
2362.65 and thereby get the
proper levels of melatonin
2366.16 according to the time of year,
2367.61 we should all try and get
outside as much as possible
2370.96 during the long days of summer and spring.
2374.2 And in the winter months, it makes sense
2376.06 to spend more time indoors.
2377.76 For those of you that suffer
2378.84 from seasonal effective disorder,
2380.2 which is a seasonal depression,
2381.49 or feel low during the
fall and winter months,
2384.22 there are ways to offset this.
2385.34 We did an entire episode on
mood and circadian rhythms
2387.92 where we described this.
2389.15 So it does make sense for some people
2390.5 to get more bright light in
their eyes early in the morning
2392.97 and throughout the day during
the winter months as well.
2396.05 But nonetheless, changes in melatonin,
2399.42 meaning changes in the duration
2401.09 of melatonin release across the
year are normal and healthy.
2404.12 So provided that you're not
suffering from depression,
2406.8 it's going to be healthy to
somewhat modulate your amount
2409.57 of indoor and outdoor
time across the year.
2411.69 The other thing to understand
2413.27 is this very firmly established fact,
2415.08 which is light powerfully
inhibits melatonin.
2419.31 If you wake up in the middle of the night,
2421.01 and you go into the bathroom
and you flip on the lights,
2423.36 and those are very bright,
overhead, fluorescent lights,
2426.52 your melatonin levels,
2428.09 which would ordinarily be quite high
2430.21 in the middle of the night
2431.043 because you've been eyes
closed in the dark, presumably,
2433.85 will immediately plummet
to near zero or zero.
2437.04 We would all do well
regardless of time of year
2440.08 to not destroy our melatonin
in the middle of the night
2444.41 in this way.
2445.42 So if you need to get up
in the middle of the night
2446.99 and use the restroom,
2447.823 which is a perfectly normal
behavior for many people,
2450.92 use the minimum amount of light required
2453.99 in order to safely move
through the environment
2457.12 that you need to move through.
2459.78 Melatonin needs to come
on early in the night.
2462.48 It actually starts rising in
the evening and towards sleep.
2466.33 But then as you close your
eyes and you go to sleep,
2468.25 melatonin levels are
going to continue to rise
2470.72 at least for several hours into the night.
2473.63 Again, if you get up in
the middle of the night,
2475.25 really try hard not to flip
on a lot of bright lights.
2477.95 If you do that every once in a while,
2479.5 it's not going to be a problem.
2481.06 But if you're doing
that night after night,
2483.01 you are really disrupting
this fundamental signal
2487.49 that occurs every night,
2489.03 regardless of winter,
spring, summer, et cetera.
2491.13 And that is communicating information
2493.53 about where your brain and
body should be in time.
2497.1 And I know that's a little
bit of a tricky concept,
2498.92 but really our body is
not meant to function
2501.88 in the same way during the winter months,
2503.38 as the summer months.
2504.57 There are functions that
are specifically optimal
2508.03 for the shorter days of winter.
2509.67 And there are functions that
are specifically optimal
2511.84 for the longer or days of summer.
2513.84 So again, try to avoid bright
light exposure to your eyes
2518.56 in the middle of the night.
2519.61 And for those of you that
are doing shift work,
2521.61 what I can say is try and
avoid getting bright light
2524.14 in your eyes in the middle
of your sleep cycle.
2526.1 So even if you're sleeping
in the middle of the day,
2527.47 because you have to work at night,
2528.77 if you wake up during that about of sleep,
2531.21 really try hard to limit
the amount of light,
2533.39 which is going to be harder
for shift workers, right?
2535.61 Because there are generally
a lot more lights on
2537.45 and bright lights outside,
2538.54 so you would want to close the blinds
2540.1 and limit artificial light inside.
2542.42 One way to bypass some
of the inhibitory effects
2545.98 of light on melatonin
2547.45 is to change your physical environment
2550.01 by, for instance, dimming the lights.
2552.04 That's one simple way, very low-cost way.
2554.03 In fact, you'll save money
by dimming the lights
2555.81 or turning them off.
2556.75 The other is if you
are going to use light,
2559.17 using long wavelength light,
because, as you recall,
2561.87 these intrinsically
photosensitive melanopsin cells
2564.09 within your retina that convey the signal
2566.77 about bright light in your environment
2569.07 to impact melatonin,
to shut down melatonin,
2571.78 respond to short wavelengths of light.
2573.89 So red light is long wavelength light.
2575.9 You now understand that
from our discussion
2577.8 about the physics of light.
2579.66 And if you were to use
amber-colored light or red light
2583.45 and even better, dim
amber or dim red light
2586.73 in the middle of the night,
2587.563 well, then you would probably
not reduce melatonin at all
2591.13 unless those red lights and amber lights
2593.07 are very, very bright.
2594.12 Any light, provided it's bright enough,
2596.31 will shut down melatonin production.
2598.9 One final point about melatonin,
2600.757 and this relates to melatonin
supplementation as well,
2604.01 is that now that you understand
2605.96 how potently melatonin can impact things
2608.11 like cardiovascular
function, immune function,
2609.95 anti-cancer properties, bone mass,
2612.28 gonad function, et cetera,
2614.37 you can understand why it would make sense
2616.71 to be cautious about
melatonin supplementation,
2619.01 because supplementation
tends to be pretty static.
2621.53 It's X number of milligrams per night,
2624.49 whereas normally endogenously
the amount of melatonin
2628.35 that you're releasing each night
2629.45 is changing according to time of year,
2632.17 or if you happen to live in an area
2634.37 where there isn't much change
in day length across the year,
2636.97 so for instance, if you
live near the equator,
2639.19 well, then your body is accustomed
to having regular amounts
2642.73 of melatonin each night.
2644.05 When you start supplementing melatonin,
2646.21 you start changing the total
amount of melatonin, obviously,
2649.28 but you're also changing
the normal rhythms
2652.28 in how much melatonin is being released
2655.03 into your brain and body
2656.36 across the 365-day calendar year.
2659.05 So while I'm somebody
2660.23 who readily embraces
supplementation in various forms,
2664.02 for things like sleep
and focus, et cetera,
2666.41 when it comes to melatonin,
I'm extremely cautious.
2670.1 And I think it's also
one of the few examples
2672.61 where a hormone is available
without prescription,
2675.86 over the counter.
2676.693 You just go into a pharmacy
or drugstore or order online,
2678.7 this hormone, which is known
2680.41 to have all these powerful effects.
2681.91 So I get very, very concerned
2683.358 when I hear about people taking melatonin,
2685.72 especially at the levels that are present
2687.43 in most supplements.
2688.6 It's been recognized for a very long time,
2690.63 and in fact, there are now
data to support the fact
2693.59 that animals of all
kinds, including humans,
2696.63 will seek out mates and
engage in mating behavior
2699.89 more frequently during the
long days of spring and summer.
2704.19 That's right, in
seasonally-breeding animals,
2706.86 of course, this is the case,
2708.7 but in humans as well,
2710.9 there is more seeking out
of mates and mating behavior
2713.83 in longer day times of year.
2716.89 Now, you could imagine
at least two mechanisms
2719.57 by which this occurs.
2721.56 The first mechanism we could
easily map to melatonin
2725.41 and the fact that melatonin is suppressive
2728.04 to various aspects of the
so-called gonadal axis,
2731.47 which is basically a fancy way of saying
2734.05 that melatonin inhibits
testosterone and estrogen output
2737.73 from the testes and from the ovaries.
2740.15 I just want to remind people
that both males and females
2742.32 make testosterone and estrogen,
2744.72 although in different ratios, typically,
2746.33 in males versus females,
2747.64 and that both testosterone and estrogen
2750.61 are critical for the desire to
mate and for mating behavior.
2755.9 There's a broad misconception
that testosterone
2758.609 is involved in mating behavior
2760.32 and estrogen's involved
in other behaviors,
2762.02 but having enough estrogen is critical
2764.68 for both males and females
2765.96 in order to maintain the desire to mate,
2768.08 and indeed the ability to mate.
2770.21 I discuss this on the episode
2772.0 on optimizing testosterone and estrogen.
2774.36 So if you'd like more details on that,
2775.98 please see that episode of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.
2779.34 Okay, so if melatonin is suppressive
2782.88 to the so-called gonadal axis
and reduces overall levels
2787.41 of testosterone and estrogen
in males and females
2790.03 and a light inhibits melatonin,
2793.56 then when there's more light,
then there's less melatonin
2796.75 and more hormone output from the gonads.
2799.57 And indeed that's how the system works,
2801.73 but that's not the entire story.
2803.75 It turns out that there is a second
2806.12 so-called parallel pathway,
2807.82 meaning a different biological pathway
2810.55 that operates in parallel
2812.34 to the light suppression
of melatonin pathway
2815.5 that provides a basis for longer days,
2818.73 inspiring more desire to mate
and more mating behavior.
2822.08 So if we think of the first
pathway involving melatonin
2825.27 as sort of a break on these
reproductive hormones,
2828.52 the second mechanism is
more like an accelerator
2831.12 on those hormones.
2832.09 And yet it still involve light.
2835.11 As I'm about to tell you,
in animals such as mice,
2838.77 but also in humans,
2840.64 exposure to light, in
particular UV blue light,
2844.07 so short wavelengths of light,
2846.17 can trigger increases in
testosterone and estrogen
2849.22 and the desire to mate.
2850.82 Now what's especially important
about this accelerator
2853.67 on the desire to mate and
mating behavior and hormones
2856.85 is that it is driven by exposure to light,
2860.95 but it is not the exposure
of light to the eyes.
2864.77 It turns out that it is
the exposure of your skin
2868.17 to particular wavelengths of light
2870.25 that is triggering
increases in the hormones,
2872.89 testosterone, and estrogen,
2874.51 leading to increased desire to mate.
2877.06 As it turns out, your skin,
2879.27 which most of us just think of as a way
2881.44 to protect the organs of our body
2883.39 or something to hang
clothes on or ornaments on,
2886.34 if you're somebody who
has earrings and so forth,
2889.48 your skin is actually an endocrine organ,
2892.38 meaning it is a hormone-producing
2895.22 and hormone-influencing organ.
2898.24 I promise what I'm about to tell you next
2899.7 will forever change the way that you think
2901.56 about your skin and light
and the desire to mate,
2905.8 and indeed even mating behavior.
2908.44 I think the results are best understood
2910.6 by simply going through the primary data,
2913.03 meaning the actual research on this topic.
2915.4 And to do so, I'm going
to review a recent paper
2917.59 that was published in
the Journal Cell Reports,
2920.0 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.
2922.12 This is a paper that came out in 2021,
2925.42 entitled "Skin Exposure to UVB light
2928.68 induces a skin, brain, gonad
axis, and sexual behavior.
2933.13 And I want to emphasize
that this was a paper
2935.81 that focused on mice
2938.22 in order to address specific mechanisms,
2940.6 because in mice,
2941.65 you can so-called knock
out particular genes.
2944.28 You can remove particular
genes to understand mechanism.
2946.64 You just can't do that in humans
2948.19 in any kind of controlled way,
2950.0 at least not at this point in time.
2952.2 And this study also explores humans
2955.42 and looked at human
subjects, both men and women.
2959.38 The basic finding of this study was that
2962.43 when mice or humans were exposed to UVB,
2966.33 meaning ultraviolet blue light,
so shortwave length light
2968.53 of the sort that comes
through in sunshine,
2971.01 but is also available through
various artificial sources.
2975.95 If they received enough exposure
2978.59 of that light to their skin,
2981.32 there were increases in
testosterone that were observed
2984.87 within a very brief period of time,
2987.03 also increases in the hormone estrogen.
2990.12 And I should point out that
the proper ratios of estrogen
2992.577 and testosterone were maintained
in both males and females,
2995.85 at least as far as these data indicate,
2998.76 and mice tended to seek out
mating more and mate more.
3004.48 There were also increases
in gonadal weight,
3007.63 literally increases in testy
size and in ovarian size
3011.3 when mice were exposed to this UVB light
3014.08 past a certain threshold.
3015.54 Now, as I mentioned before, the
study also looked at humans.
3018.2 They did not look at
testy size or ovarian size
3021.98 in the human subjects.
3023.3 However, because they're humans,
3025.28 they did address the psychology
of these human beings
3029.0 and addressed whether or
not they had increases
3031.47 in, for instance, aggressiveness
or in passionate feelings
3034.84 and how their perception
of other people changed
3038.7 when they were getting a
lot of UVB light exposure
3042.36 to the skin.
3043.24 So before I get into some of
the more important details
3045.39 of the study and how it was done
3047.08 and how you can leverage this
information for yourself,
3049.79 if you desire,
3052.04 I just want to highlight some
of the basic findings overall.
3055.65 UVB exposure increased these
so-called sex steroid levels
3059.41 in mice and humans.
3060.72 The sex steroid hormones,
when we say steroids,
3063.81 we don't mean anabolic
steroids taken exogenously.
3066.53 I think when people
hear the word steroids,
3067.92 they always think steroid
abuse or use, rather.
3070.955 Steroid hormones, such as
testosterone and estrogen,
3073.93 went up when mice or humans
had a lot of UVB exposure
3078.002 to their skin.
3079.25 Second of all, UVB light
exposure to the skin
3082.81 enhanced female attractiveness,
3084.66 so the perceived attractiveness
of females by males,
3087.82 and increased the receptiveness
3090.12 or the desire to mate in both sexes.
3093.39 UVB light exposure also
changed various aspects
3096.68 of female biology related to fertility,
3099.05 in particular follicle growth.
3101.53 Follicle and egg maturation
3103.8 are well-known indices of fertility,
3107.31 and of course, correlate
with the menstrual cycle
3109.76 in adult humans and is related overall
3112.9 to the propensity to become pregnant.
3116.367 UVB light exposure enhanced
maturation of the follicle,
3119.39 which just meant that more
healthy eggs were being produced.
3122.58 These are impressive effects.
3123.94 First of all, they
looked at a large number
3125.9 of variables in the study.
3127.2 And the fact that they looked
3128.12 at mice and humans is terrific.
3130.19 I think that oftentimes we
find it hard to translate data
3133.1 from mice to humans.
3133.95 So the fact that they
looked at both in parallel
3136.31 is wonderful.
3138.49 In the mice and in the humans,
3140.3 they established a protocol
3142.8 that essentially involved
exposing the skin to UV light
3146.95 that was equivalent to
about 20 to 30 minutes
3149.44 of midday sun exposure.
3151.38 Now, of course, where
you live in the world
3153.09 will dictate whether
or not that midday sun
3154.73 is very, very bright and
intense or is less bright.
3157.67 Maybe there's cloud cover, et cetera.
3159.4 But since I'm imagining that
most people are interested
3163.13 in the ways to increase testosterone
3165.73 and/or estrogen in humans
3167.75 and are not so much interested
3168.87 in increasing testosterone in mice,
3171.1 I'm going to just review what they did
3172.85 in the human population
or the human subjects.
3175.94 What they did is they had people,
3178.28 first of all, establish a baseline.
3180.07 And the way they established a baseline
3181.36 was a little bit unusual,
3182.67 but will make perfect sense to you.
3184.56 They had people wear long sleeves
3186.02 and essentially cover up and
avoid sunlight for a few days
3188.82 so they could measure
their baseline hormones
3190.75 in the absence of getting
a lot of UVB light exposure
3194.378 from the sun or from other sources.
3196.63 Now, of course, these people had access
3198.88 to artificial lights,
3200.02 but as I've pointed out
on this podcast before,
3202.06 it's pretty unusual that
you'll get enough UVB exposure
3205.45 from artificial lights throughout the day.
3208.03 And in the morning you
need a lot of UVB exposure,
3210.71 or we should be getting a lot
of UVB exposure to our eyes
3214.11 and to our face and to our
skin throughout the day,
3216.05 provided we're not getting sunburnt.
3217.74 This is actually a healthy
thing for mood and for energy
3220.22 throughout the day.
3221.22 It's only at night,
basically between the hours
3223.94 of about 10:00 pm and 4:00 am,
3226.31 that even a tiny bit of UVB
exposure from artificial sources
3229.74 can mess us up in terms of our sleep
3231.667 and our energy levels, and so on.
3233.46 And that's because of
the potent effect of UVB
3235.88 on suppressing melatonin.
3238.08 So the point here is that
they establish a baseline
3241.22 whereby people were getting
some artificial light exposure
3244.23 throughout the day,
3245.063 but they weren't getting outside a lot.
3246.69 They weren't getting a lot of sunlight.
3248.38 And then they had people receive a dose
3251.75 of UVB light exposure
3254.06 that was about 20 to 30 minutes outdoors.
3256.86 They had people wear short
sleeves, no hat, no sunglasses.
3260.35 Some people wore sleeveless shirts.
3261.92 They encouraged people to wear shorts.
3263.61 So they were indeed wearing clothing.
3266.01 They were not naked.
3267.4 And they were wearing
clothing that was culturally
3270.31 and situationally appropriate,
3271.47 at least for the part of the world
3272.98 where this study was done.
3274.39 And they had people do that
two or three times a week.
3277.15 So in terms of a protocol
3278.37 that you might export from this study,
3279.89 basically getting outside
for about 30 minutes,
3282.04 two or three times a week
in a minimum of clothing,
3284.73 and yet still wearing enough clothing
3287.22 that is culturally appropriate.
3288.97 They were outside, they
weren't sun bathing,
3291.21 flipping over on their back and front.
3292.62 They were just moving about doing things.
3293.87 They could read, they could talk,
3295.44 they could go about other activities,
3297.56 but they weren't wearing a broad brim hat
3299.59 or a hat of any kind,
3300.58 just getting a lot of sun
exposure to their skin.
3303.75 They did this for a total
of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.
3308.03 So this took several weeks, right?
3310.1 It took about a month,
if you think about it,
3311.45 two or three times per week
3312.38 for a total of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.
3315.81 These treatments, of course,
are just being outside
3317.33 in the sun.
3318.42 And then they measured hormones,
3320.9 and they measured the psychology
3322.12 of these male and female adult subjects.
3324.95 Let's first look at the
psychological changes
3327.11 that these human subjects experienced
3328.98 after getting 10 to 12 of
these UVB light exposure
3333.09 outdoor and sunlight type treatments.
3335.41 They did this by collecting blood samples
3337.12 throughout the study,
3338.43 and they saw significant increases
3340.99 in the hormones, beta-estradiol,
3342.73 which is one of the
major forms of estrogen,
3345.27 progesterone, another
important steroid hormone,
3348.45 and testosterone in both men and women.
3351.72 Now, an important point is
that the testosterone increases
3355.24 were significantly higher in
men that happened to originate
3359.33 from countries that had low UV exposure
3364.08 compared to individuals from countries
3365.56 with high UV exposure.
3367.97 Now, this ought to make sense
3370.11 if we understand a little bit
3371.37 about how the skin functions
as an endocrine organ.
3374.01 Many of you have probably
heard of vitamin D3,
3377.07 which is a vitamin that we all make.
3379.73 Many people supplement it as well
3381.21 if they need additional vitamin D3.
3384.32 We all require sunlight in
order to allow vitamin D3
3388.84 to be synthesized and perform
its roles in the body.
3392.2 And it turns out that
people who have darker skin
3395.15 actually need more vitamin D3
and/or more sunlight exposure
3399.73 in order to activate that D3 pathway,
3402.22 than do people with paler skin.
3405.3 And this should make sense to all of you
3407.49 given what you now
understand about melanocytes,
3410.19 that cell type that we discussed earlier,
3411.76 because melanocytes have
pigment within them.
3414.84 And if you have darker skin,
3416.67 it means that you have more melanocytes
3419.3 or that you have melanocytes
3420.58 that are more efficient
at creating pigment.
3423.99 And as a consequence,
3426.01 the light that lands on your skin
3426.909 will be absorbed by those melanocytes,
3429.42 and less of it is able
to impact the D3 pathway.
3432.75 Whereas if you have pale skin,
3434.07 more of the light that lands on your skin
3436.11 can trigger the synthesis
3438.2 and assist the actions of vitamin D3.
3442.37 Similarly, in this study, they found
3444.35 that people who had paler skin
3445.183 and/or who originated from countries
3448.21 where they had less UVB light
exposure across the year
3452.3 had greater, meaning more
significant, increases
3455.53 in testosterone overall
3456.97 than did people who
already were getting a lot
3459.64 of UVB exposure.
3461.12 This led them to explore
so-called seasonal changes
3463.85 in testosterone that occurred normally
3466.44 in the absence of any
light exposure treatment.
3469.71 So up until now, I've been
talking about the aspects
3472.66 of this study involving
people getting outside
3475.18 for about 20 to 30 minutes
per day in sunlight,
3478.01 in a minimum of clothing.
3479.47 There was an increase
in testosterone observed
3481.87 in both men and women.
3483.3 The increases in testosterone were greater
3485.32 for people that had paler
skin than darker skin.
3488.56 So the data I'm about to describe
3490.27 also come from this same
paper, but do not involve
3493.03 20 to 30 minute daily
sun exposure protocols.
3496.13 It's simply addressing whether
or not testosterone levels
3499.68 change as a function of time of year.
3504.01 They measure testosterone
across the 12-month calendar.
3507.86 This study was done on subjects living
3509.7 in the Northern Hemisphere
for the entire year.
3512.23 And so in the months of
January, February, and March,
3515.54 of course, the length of days is shortest
3518.65 and the length of nights is longest.
3521.1 And, of course, in the
spring and summer months,
3523.64 June, July, August, September, and so on,
3525.75 the days are much longer
and the nights are shorter.
3527.78 And what they observed was very obvious.
3531.61 They observed that testosterone levels
3534.62 were lowest in the winter months
3536.82 and were highest in the months
3538.42 of June, July, August, and September.
3541.28 Now, these are very important data.
3543.08 At least to my knowledge,
3543.913 these are the first data
systematically exploring the levels
3547.49 of sex steroid hormones in humans
3550.0 as a function of time of year
3551.62 and thereby as a function
3553.45 of how much sunlight
exposure they're getting.
3556.0 And what's remarkable about these data
3557.95 is that they map very
well to the data in mice
3560.68 and the other data in
this paper on humans,
3563.6 which illustrate that if you're
getting more UVB exposure,
3568.04 your testosterone levels are higher.
3569.81 This study went a step further
3571.09 and explored whether or not
the amount of sunlight exposure
3573.78 that one is getting to their skin
3575.27 influences their psychology
3577.42 in terms of whether or not
they have increased desire
3580.13 to mate and so on.
3581.6 It's well known that sunlight exposure
3583.97 to the eyes can increase mood.
3586.81 And I talked about this
in the podcast episode
3588.775 with my guest, Dr. Samer Hattar,
3590.684 who's the director of
the chronobiology unit
3592.8 at the National Institutes
of Mental Health.
3594.43 And Samer's recommendation
3595.72 is that people get as
much bright light exposure
3597.55 as they safely can in the
morning and throughout the day
3600.23 for sake of both sleep and energy,
3602.45 but also for enhancing mood
and regulating appetite.
3606.9 In this study, it was found
3608.84 that both males and
females had higher levels
3612.03 of romantic passion after
getting the UV treatment.
3616.18 In fact, some of them reported
increases in romantic passion
3618.76 from just one or two
of these UV treatments.
3621.49 So they didn't have to go
through all 10 or 12 in order
3624.58 to get a statistically
significant increase in passion.
3628.43 Now, when we talk about passion,
3630.06 as the authors of this paper acknowledge,
3632.03 there's really two forms.
3632.99 There is emotional and sexual,
3634.69 and they parse this pretty finely.
3636.44 I don't want to go into all the details,
3637.98 and we can provide a reference
and link to this study
3639.76 if you'd like to look at those details.
3641.76 But what they found was that women
3644.61 receiving this UVB light exposure
3647.7 focused more on increases
3649.55 in physical arousal and sexual passion,
3651.78 whereas the men actually scored higher
3653.75 on the cognitive dimensions of passion,
3655.62 such as obsessive thoughts
about their partner and so on.
3658.26 Regardless, both males and females
3661.56 experienced and reported a
increase in sexual passion
3665.45 and desire to mate.
3666.92 And we now know there were increases
3668.66 in testosterone and estrogen,
3670.52 which of course could be driving
the psychological changes,
3673.23 although I'm sure that those
interact in both directions,
3675.86 meaning the hormones no
doubt affect psychology
3679.43 and no doubt the psychology,
3681.24 these changes in passionate feelings,
3682.99 no doubt also increased
3684.91 or changed the hormone levels as well.
3686.95 And I want to reemphasize
3689.41 that there was a component of the study
3691.43 that had no deliberate
daylight, sunlight exposure
3695.32 for 20 or 30 minutes,
3696.38 but rather just looked at hormone
levels throughout the year
3699.63 and found that the increase in day length
3704.02 correlated with increases
3705.46 in testosterone and sexual passion.
3707.45 Now, in my opinion, this
is a very noteworthy study
3710.18 because it really illustrates
that sunlight and day length
3714.36 can impact the melatonin pathway
3716.43 and thereby take the foot off the brake,
3719.64 so to speak, on testosterone, estrogen,
3722.617 and the desire to mate.
3724.01 It also emphasizes that
sunlight, UVB light,
3728.25 can directly trigger hormone pathways
3731.4 and desire to mate and mating behavior.
3734.13 Now, this study went a step further
3735.53 in defining the precise mechanism
3737.54 by which light can
impact all these hormones
3739.537 and this desire to mate.
3741.6 And here, understanding
the mechanism is key
3743.7 if you want to export
a particular protocol
3746.17 or tool that you might apply.
3749.34 We talked earlier about how
UVB light exposure to the eyes
3752.47 triggers activation of
these particular neurons
3754.61 within the eye,
3755.67 and then with centers deeper in the brain,
3757.94 and eventually the pineal gland
3759.82 to suppress the output of melatonin
3762.2 and thereby to allow
testosterone and estrogen
3765.07 to exist at higher levels
3766.23 because melatonin can inhibit
testosterone and estrogen.
3770.62 In this study,
3771.7 they were able to very clearly establish
3774.14 that it is sunlight exposure to our skin
3777.49 that is causing these hormone increases
3779.47 that they observed in mice and humans.
3782.15 And the way they did that
3783.61 was to use the so-called
knockout technology,
3786.69 the ability to remove specific genes
3788.73 within specific tissues of the body.
3791.11 And what they found is that UVB light,
3793.65 meaning sunlight-exposed skin,
3797.42 upregulated, meaning
increased the activity
3799.53 of something called p53,
3801.03 which is involved in
the maturation of cells
3804.06 and various aspects of cellular function.
3806.03 And the cells they were focused
on were the keratinocytes,
3809.89 which you are now familiar with
from our earlier discussion
3812.56 about the fact that the
epidermis of your skin
3815.14 contains mainly keratinocytes
and melanocytes.
3818.95 Sunlight exposure increased
p53 activity in the skin.
3823.06 And p53 activity was required
for the downstream increases
3828.06 in ovarian size, in testicular size,
3831.03 in testosterone increases,
in the estrogen increases,
3835.58 and the various other changes
3837.31 that they observed at
the physiological level
3840.02 when animals or humans
were exposed to sunlight.
3843.11 So these data are important
because what they mean
3844.96 is that not only is it important
3846.95 that we get sunlight
exposure early in the day
3849.87 and throughout the day to our eyes,
3851.69 at least as much as is safely possible,
3854.05 but that we also need to
get UVB sunlight exposure
3856.75 onto our skin if we want to
activate this p53 pathway
3861.07 in keratinocytes and the
testosterone and estrogen increases
3865.69 that are downstream of that p53 pathway.
3868.43 So even though the gene knockout
studies were done on mice,
3873.27 they clearly show that if
you remove p53 from the skin,
3876.63 that these effects simply do not occur.
3879.24 So in terms of thinking about a protocol
3881.64 to increase testosterone and estrogen,
3883.56 mood and feelings of passion,
3885.9 the idea is that you would want
3887.8 to get these two to
three exposures per week,
3891.6 minimum of 20 to 30 minutes
of sunlight exposure
3895.51 onto as much of your body
3897.49 as you can reasonably expose it to.
3899.84 And when I say reasonably, I mean,
3902.08 of course you have to
obey cultural constraints,
3904.41 decency constraints.
3905.71 And of course you have
to also obey the fact
3908.69 that sunlight can burn your skin.
3910.66 So many people are probably going to ask,
3912.967 "What happens if you wear sunscreen?"
3915.25 Well, in theory, because
sunscreen has UV protection,
3919.73 it would block some of these effects.
3921.88 Now I'm not suggesting
3922.713 that people do away
with sunscreen entirely.
3924.62 I do hope to do an episode all
about sunscreen in the future
3927.81 because sunscreen is a bit
of a controversial topic.
3931.0 Skin cancers are a real thing,
3932.76 and many people are especially
prone to skin cancer,
3935.66 so you need to take that seriously.
3937.57 Some people are not very
prone to skin cancers
3939.84 and can tolerate much more sun exposure.
3942.66 You're probably familiar
with the simple fact
3944.51 that if you've gone outside
on the beach with friends,
3947.93 some people get burned
very easily, others don't.
3949.99 So you really should prioritize the health
3952.47 and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin.
3954.88 However, these data and
other data point to the fact
3958.78 that we should all probably be striving
3961.54 to get more sunlight
exposure onto our skin
3964.21 during the winter months
3965.71 and still getting sunlight
exposure onto our skin
3968.97 in the summer months,
3970.05 provided we can do that
without damaging our skin.
3972.8 Another set of very impressive
effects of UVB light,
3975.69 whether or not it comes from sunlight
3976.78 or from an artificial source,
3978.95 is the effect of UVB light
on our tolerance for pain.
3982.44 It turns out that our tolerance for pain
3984.35 varies across the year
3986.19 and that our pain tolerance is increased
3989.39 in longer day conditions.
3992.16 And as we saw with the effects of UVB
3994.85 on hormones and mating,
3997.84 again, this is occurring
via UVB exposure to the skin
4002.237 and UVB exposure to the eyes.
4005.16 I want to just describe two studies
4006.75 that really capture the
essence of these results.
4009.52 I'm going to discuss these in
kind of a top contour fashion.
4012.54 I won't go into it as quite as much depth
4014.26 as I did the last study,
4015.46 but I will provide links
to these studies as well.
4019.01 The first study is entitled
4020.91 Skin Exposure to Ultraviolet
B Rapidly Activates
4024.6 Systemic, Neuroendocrine, and
Immunosuppressive Responses.
4027.57 And you might hear that and think,
4028.403 "Oh, immunosuppressive that's bad."
4029.9 But basically what they observed
is that even one exposure
4034.89 to UVB light changed the
output of particular hormones
4038.49 and neurochemicals in the body,
4040.1 such as corticotropin
hormone and beta-endorphins,
4043.67 which are these endogenous opioids.
4045.75 We've all heard of the opioid crisis,
4047.33 which is people getting
addicted to opioids
4049.5 that they are taking in
drug form, pharmaceuticals.
4052.83 But here I'm referring to endorphins
4055.09 that our body naturally
manufactures and releases
4057.57 in order to counter pain
4059.11 and act as somewhat of a
psychological soother also,
4064.13 because, of course, physical
pain and emotional pain
4066.41 are intimately linked
in the brain and body.
4068.74 What they found was that
exposure to UVB light
4071.98 increased the release of
these beta-endorphins.
4075.08 It caused essentially the release
4076.64 of an endogenous pain killer.
4079.41 Now, a second study that
came out very recently,
4083.04 just this last week, in fact,
4084.81 published in the journal Neuron,
4086.07 Cell Press journal, excellent journal,
4088.29 is entitled A Visual Circuit Related
4090.29 to the Periaqueductal Gray Area
4092.42 for the Antinociceptive Effects
of Bright Light Treatment.
4095.33 I'll translate a little
bit of that for you.
4098.01 The periaqueductal gray is
a region of the mid-brain
4101.65 that contains a lot of neurons
4104.18 that can release endogenous opioids,
4106.89 things like beta-enkephalin,
things like enkephalin,
4110.85 things like mu opioid.
4112.25 These are all names of chemicals
4114.36 that your body can manufacture
4115.67 that act as endogenous pain killers
4117.65 and increase your tolerance for pain.
4119.52 They actually make you
feel less pain overall
4121.93 by shutting down some of the neurons
4123.78 that perceive pain or by
reducing their activity.
4127.15 Not to a dangerous level, right?
4128.69 They're not going to
block the pain response
4130.17 so that you burn yourself unnecessarily
4132.66 or harm yourself unnecessarily,
4134.2 but they act a bit of a
pain killer from the inside.
4139.01 If you heard the word antinociceptive,
4141.31 nociception is basically
the perception or the way
4146.49 in which neurons respond
to painful stimuli.
4149.46 So you can think of nociceptive events
4151.73 in your nervous system as painful events.
4154.09 And there I'm using a broad brush.
4155.76 I realized that the
experts in pain will say,
4157.557 "Oh, it's not really a pain circuit,"
4159.55 et cetera, et cetera.
4160.5 But for sake of today's discussion,
4162.89 it's fair to say that nociception
is the perception of pain.
4166.52 So if this title is A
Visual Circuit Related
4169.55 to the Periaqueductal Gray,
4171.36 which is this area that releases
these endogenous opioids
4174.24 for the antinociceptive,
the anti-pain effects
4176.87 of bright light treatment,
4180.18 the key finding of this study
4181.57 is that it is light landing
on the eyes and captured
4186.78 by the specific cells I
was talking about earlier,
4189.02 those intrinsically photosensitive
melanopsin ganglion cells
4191.827 is the long name for them,
4193.1 but these particular neurons in your eye,
4194.95 and in my eye incidentally,
4197.32 that communicate with
particular brain areas.
4200.64 These brain areas have names.
4201.75 If you want to know
them, for you aficionados
4204.09 or for you ultra curious folks,
4205.76 they have names like the ventral
lateral geniculate nucleus
4208.15 and the intergeniculate leaflet.
4209.62 The names don't matter.
4210.82 The point is that light
landing on the eyes
4213.43 is captured by these melanopsin cells.
4216.74 They absorb that light,
4218.04 translate that light
into electrical signals
4220.25 that are handed off to areas of the brain,
4222.04 such as the ventral geniculate.
4224.49 And then the ventral
geniculate communicates
4227.69 with this periaqueductal gray area
4230.32 to evoke the release of
these endogenous opioids
4234.0 that soothe you and lead
to less perception of pain.
4238.02 This is a really important study
4239.41 because it's long been
known that in longer days
4243.39 or in bright light environments,
4244.67 we tolerate emotional
and physical pain better.
4248.6 Previous studies had shown
4250.03 that it is light landing on our skin
4253.03 that mediates that
effect, but only in part.
4255.5 It couldn't explain the entire effect.
4257.44 This very recent study indicates
4259.42 that it's also light arriving at the eyes,
4262.39 and in this case, again, UVB
light, ultraviolet blue light
4265.2 of the sort that comes from sunlight,
4268.4 that is triggering these anti-pain
4271.02 or pain-relieving pathways.
4272.74 So once again, we have
two parallel pathways.
4275.23 This is a theme you're going to hear
4276.36 over and over and over again,
not just in this episode,
4279.08 but in all episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast,
4281.51 because this is the way that
your brain and body are built.
4284.81 Nature rarely relies on one mechanism
4287.96 in order to create an
important phenomenon,
4290.23 and pain relief is an
important phenomenon.
4292.46 So we now have at least two
examples of the potent effects
4295.95 of UVB light exposure to
the skin and to the eyes.
4299.61 One involving activation of testosterone
4304.008 and estrogen pathways,
as it relates to mating,
4306.38 and another that relates to
reducing the total amount
4310.25 of pain that we experience
4311.66 in response to any painful stimuli.
4314.24 So for those of you that are
thinking tools and protocols,
4317.19 if you're somebody who's
experiencing chronic pain,
4320.17 provided you can do it safely,
4321.8 try to get some UVB exposure,
ideally from sunlight.
4326.22 I think the 20 to 30-minute protocol,
4327.96 two or three times per
week is an excellent one,
4330.57 seems like a fairly low
dose of UVB light exposure.
4334.32 It's hard to imagine getting
much damage to the skin.
4337.38 Of course, if you have
very sensitive skin,
4339.78 or if you live in an area of the world
4342.07 that is very, very bright
4343.347 and has intense sunlight at
particular times of year,
4346.42 you'll want to be cautious.
4347.87 Heed the warnings and
considerations about sunscreen
4350.49 that I talked about earlier,
or about wearing a hat.
4352.92 But the point is very clear.
4354.9 Most of us should be
getting more UVB exposure
4358.3 from sunlight.
4360.14 I can already hear the
screams within the comments
4362.58 or rather the questions
within the comments, saying,
4364.577 "Well, what if I live
in a part of the world
4366.26 where I don't get much UVB exposure?"
4368.79 And I want to emphasize something
that I've also emphasized
4370.989 in the many discussions on this podcast
4373.16 related to sleep and circadian
rhythms and alertness,
4375.5 which is even on a cloud-covered day,
4379.41 you are going to get far
more light energy, photons
4383.19 through cloud cover than
you are going to get
4386.67 from an indoor light source,
an artificial light source.
4390.18 I can't emphasize this enough.
4392.73 If you look outside in the morning
4394.09 and you see some sunlight,
4396.13 if you see some sunlight
throughout the day,
4397.78 you would do yourself a great favor
4400.41 to try and chase some of that sunlight
4402.14 and get into that sunlight
to expose your eyes
4405.13 and your skin to that sunlight
as much as you safely can.
4408.17 And when I say as much as you safely can,
4410.61 never ever look at any light,
4411.94 artificial, sunlight, or otherwise,
4413.67 that's so bright that
it's painful to look at.
4415.34 It's fine to get that light
4416.73 arriving on your eyes indirectly.
4418.86 It's fine to wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses.
4421.38 In fact, if you think about
the biology of the eye
4423.64 and the way that those lenses work,
4425.13 that you will just serve
to focus that light
4427.52 onto the very cells that
you want those light beams
4430.296 to be delivered to,
4431.95 whereas sunglasses that
are highly reflective
4434.22 or trying to get your sunlight exposure
4436.05 through a windshield of a car
4438.01 or through a window simply won't work.
4440.98 I'm sorry to tell you,
4442.1 but most windows are designed
to filter out the UVB light.
4446.25 And if you're somebody who's
really keen on blue blockers
4449.05 and you're wearing your
blue blockers all day,
4451.04 well, don't wear them outside.
4453.06 And in fact, you're probably
doing yourself a disservice
4455.95 by wearing them in the
morning and in the daytime.
4458.31 There certainly is a
place for blue blockers
4460.14 in the evening and nighttime,
4461.35 if you're having issues with
falling and staying asleep.
4464.17 But if you think about it, blue blockers,
4466.07 what they're really doing
4466.903 is blocking those short wavelength,
UVB wavelengths of light
4470.92 that you so desperately need
to arrive at your retina
4473.86 and of course, also onto your skin
4475.99 in order to get these
powerful biological effects
4478.66 on hormones and on pain reduction.
4482.09 And in terms of skin exposure,
4484.37 these data also might make
you think a little bit
4486.59 about whether or not you
should wear short sleeves
4488.16 or long sleeves,
4488.993 whether or not you want to wear
shorts or a skirt or pants.
4491.83 It's all going to depend
on the context of your life
4493.96 and the social and other variables
4496.32 that are important, of course.
4497.85 I don't know each and every
one of your circumstances,
4500.59 so I can't tell you to do
X or Y or Z, nor would I,
4505.48 but you might take into consideration
4507.22 that it is the total
amount of skin exposure
4510.33 that is going to allow you to
capture more or fewer photons,
4514.21 depending on, for instance,
4516.23 if you're completely cloaked in clothing
4518.03 and you're just exposed in
the hands, neck, and face
4521.46 such as I am now,
4522.64 or whether or not you're
outside in shorts and a T-shirt,
4525.15 you're going to get very,
very different patterns
4528.36 of biological signaling activation
4530.84 in those two circumstances.
4532.19 Many of you I'm guessing are wondering
4533.93 whether or not you should
seek out UVB exposure
4537.17 throughout the entire year
or only in the summer months.
4539.66 And that's sort of going to depend
4541.68 on whether or not you
experience depression
4545.26 in the winter months,
4546.53 so called seasonal effective disorder.
4548.92 Some people have mild, some
people have severe forms
4551.19 of seasonal effective disorder.
4552.31 Some people love the fall and
winter and the shorter days.
4555.19 They love bundling up.
They love the leaves.
4556.92 They love the snow, they love the cold,
4558.21 and they don't experience
those psychological lows.
4560.17 So it varies tremendously.
4561.96 And there are genetic differences
4563.84 and birthplace origin differences
that relate to all this,
4567.83 but really it has to be considered
on a case-by-case basis.
4572.68 I personally believe,
and this was reinforced
4575.84 by the director of the chronobiology unit
4579.08 at the National Institutes of
Mental Health, Samer Hattar,
4581.62 that we would all do well
to get more UVB exposure
4585.12 from sunlight throughout the entire year,
4587.77 provided we aren't burning our skin
4589.26 or damaging our eyes in some way.
4592.47 In addition to that,
during the winter months,
4594.8 if you do experience some drop in energy
4598.06 or increase in depression
or psychological lows,
4603.03 it can be very beneficial
to access a SAD lamp.
4607.5 Or if you don't want to buy a SAD lamp,
4609.35 'cause oftentimes they
can be very expensive,
4611.27 you might do well to simply
get a LED lighting panel.
4615.12 I've described one before.
4616.49 And I want to emphasize that I
have no affiliation whatsoever
4620.17 to these commercial sources,
4621.87 but I've described one before
and I'll describe it again.
4623.72 And we can provide a link to
a couple examples of these
4626.16 in the show, in the show
note captions, excuse me.
4629.45 This is a 930 to 1,000
lux, L-U-X, light source
4634.84 that's designed for drawing.
4636.4 It's literally a drawing box.
4637.74 It's a thin panel. It's
about the size of a laptop.
4640.51 Very inexpensive compared
to the typical SAD lamp.
4642.73 I actually have one,
4643.563 and I position it on my desk all day long.
4645.55 I also happen to have
skylights above my desk.
4647.78 I'm fairly sensitive to
the effects of light.
4649.91 So in longer days I feel much better
4651.29 than I do in shorter days.
4652.23 I've never suffered
4653.15 from full-blown seasonal
effective disorder,
4655.18 but I keep that light
source on throughout the day
4658.73 throughout the year.
4659.69 But I also make it a point to
get outside and get sunlight
4662.11 early in the morning and several
times throughout the day.
4664.55 And if it's particularly overcast outside
4667.27 or there just doesn't seem
to be a lot of sunlight
4669.67 coming through those clouds,
4670.96 I will try to look at that light source
4673.54 a little bit more each day
4674.88 in order to trigger these mechanisms.
4677.42 Now, some people may
desire to get UVB exposure
4680.16 to their skin and they want to do that
4682.16 through sources other than sunlight.
4683.92 And there it's a little
bit more complicated.
4686.15 There are, of course, tanning salons,
4688.33 which basically are beds of UVB light.
4690.7 That's really all they are.
4692.16 I've never been to one.
4693.13 I know people do frequent them
4694.63 in certain parts of the world.
4697.07 There, of course, people
are covering their eyes.
4699.32 They are only getting UVB
exposure to their skin, typically
4701.78 because the UVB exposure,
or intensities rather,
4704.92 tend to be very, very high.
4706.56 And so you can actually damage your eyes.
4707.92 If you're looking at a very, very bright
4709.94 artificial UVB source up close.
4712.53 So you really have to explore
these options for yourself.
4715.19 Sunlight of course, being the original
4717.15 and still the best way
to get UVB exposure.
4720.78 So without knowing your particular
circumstances, finances,
4724.51 genetics, or place of origin, et cetera,
4727.39 I can't know whether or not
4728.59 you need to use artificial sources.
4729.89 You're going to have to gauge that.
4731.65 Meanwhile, getting outside, looking at
4735.25 and getting some exposure
of UVB onto your skin
4739.33 is going to be beneficial
4740.55 for the vast majority of people out there.
4743.38 And in fact, it's even
going to be beneficial
4745.53 for people that are blind.
4748.13 People that are blind,
provided they still have eyes,
4750.77 often maintain these melanopsin cells.
4754.23 So even if you're low vision or no vision,
4756.24 getting UVB exposure to your eyes
4758.11 can be very beneficial for sake of mood,
4761.06 hormone pathways, pain
reduction, and so forth.
4764.4 A cautionary note, people who
have retinitis pigmentosa,
4768.82 macular degeneration, or glaucoma,
4771.39 as well as people who are
especially prone to skin cancers
4774.73 should definitely consult
with your ophthalmologist
4777.66 and dermatologist before
you start increasing
4780.13 the total amount of UVB exposure
4781.97 that you're getting from any
source, sunlight or otherwise.
4784.99 There are additional, very
interesting and powerful effects
4787.78 of UVB light, in particular
on immune function.
4794.06 All the organs of our
body are inside our skin.
4797.33 And so information about
external conditions,
4800.5 meaning the environment that we're in,
4802.25 need to be communicated to the
various organs of our body.
4806.41 Some of them have more direct access
4808.7 to what's going on outside.
4810.63 So for instance, the cells in your brain
4813.83 that reside right over
the roof of your mouth,
4815.64 your hypothalamus, they
control hormone output,
4817.468 and they control the biological functions
4820.6 that we call circadian functions,
4821.98 the ones that change every 24 hours.
4824.47 Well, those are just
one or two connections,
4827.1 meaning synapses away from
those cells in your eye
4829.8 that perceive UB, UVB light, excuse me.
4833.44 Other organs of your
body, such as your spleen,
4836.01 which is involved in the
creation of molecules
4838.92 and cells that combat infection,
4841.26 well, those are a long ways away
4842.99 from those cell in your eye.
4843.823 And in fact, they're a long
ways away from your skin.
4847.28 There are beautiful studies showing
4848.94 that if we get more UVB
exposure from sunlight
4853.26 or from appropriate artificial sources,
4857.26 that spleen and immune
function are enhanced,
4860.83 and there's a very logical,
4863.16 well-established circuit
as to how that happens.
4866.07 Your brain actually
connects to your spleen.
4869.35 Now, it's not the case
that you can simply think,
4872.047 "Okay, spleen, turn on,
release killer cells,
4874.72 go out and combat infection."
4876.41 However, UVB light arriving on the eyes
4880.73 is known to trigger
activation of the neurons
4883.56 within the so-called
sympathetic nervous system.
4886.07 These neurons are part of the larger thing
4888.4 that we call the autonomic nervous system,
4890.14 meaning it's below or not
accessible by conscious control.
4894.21 It's the thing that
controls your heartbeat,
4895.59 controls your breathing
and that also activates
4898.06 or flips on the switch
of your immune system.
4901.04 When we get a lot of
UVB light in our eyes,
4903.6 or I should say sufficient
UVB light in our eyes,
4906.9 a particular channel, a
particular set of connections
4910.15 within the sympathetic
nervous system is activated,
4913.26 and our spleen deploys
immune cells and molecules
4917.38 that scavenge for and combat infection.
4920.33 So if you've noticed that
you get fewer colds and flus
4923.9 and other forms of illness
in the summer months,
4926.83 part of that could be because
of the increase in temperature
4930.47 in your environment,
4931.303 because typically longer
days are associated
4933.31 with more warmth in your environment
4935.66 as opposed to winter days,
4936.85 which are short when it
tends to be colder out.
4939.59 Well, that's true, but it's also the case
4944.0 that people around you
have fewer colds and flus
4946.48 and that you will get infected
with fewer colds and flus
4949.68 and other infections,
because if those infections,
4954.52 whether or not they're bacterial or viral,
4956.94 arrive in your body,
right, if you inhale them
4959.43 or they get into your
mouth or on your skin,
4962.0 your spleen meets those
infections with a greater output.
4965.55 In other words, the soldiers
of your immune system,
4967.58 the chemicals and cell
types of your immune system
4970.24 that combat infection
4972.15 are in a more ready,
deployed stance, if you will.
4976.49 If you want to know more
about the immune system
4978.21 and immune function,
4979.07 I did an entire episode
about the immune system
4981.47 and the brain, you can find
that at hubermanlab.com.
4984.85 We talk about cytokines,
4985.95 we talk about killer cells,
B cells, T cells, et cetera,
4988.06 a lot of detail there.
4989.54 So we often think about the summer months
4991.76 and the spring months as fewer
infections floating around.
4995.35 But in fact, there aren't fewer
infections floating around.
4998.89 We are simply better at
combating those infections,
5001.5 and therefore there's less
infection floating around.
5005.13 So we are still confronted
with a lot of infections.
5007.67 We're just able to combat them better.
5009.96 What does this mean in terms of a tool?
5011.41 What it means is that
during the winter months,
5013.88 we should be especially
conscious of accessing UVB light
5018.61 to enhance our spleen function,
5021.35 to make sure that our
sympathetic nervous system
5023.75 is activated to a sufficient level
5026.21 to keep our immune system
deploying all those killer T cells
5029.55 and B cells and cytokines
5031.13 so that when we encounter the infections,
5032.89 as we inevitably will, right,
5034.8 we're constantly being bombarded
with potential infections,
5037.78 that we can combat those infections well.
5040.28 And as just a brief aside,
5042.02 but I should mention, a brief aside
5043.65 that's related to tens of
thousands of quality studies,
5047.29 it is well known that
wound healing is faster
5050.58 when we are getting
sufficient UVB exposure.
5053.94 Typically, that's associated
with the longer days
5056.36 of spring and summer.
5057.74 It is known that turnover of hair cells,
5061.43 the very cells that
give rise to hair cells
5063.61 are called stem cells.
5064.443 They live in little
so-called niches in our skin
5067.08 with these hair stem cells,
5068.51 and your hair grows faster in longer days.
5071.04 That too is triggered by UVB exposure,
5074.49 not just to the skin, but to the eyes.
5077.56 That's right.
5078.48 There was a study published
5079.67 in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences
5082.31 a couple of years ago that
showed that the exposure
5086.26 of those melanopsin
ganglion cells in your eyes
5088.59 is absolutely critical for
triggering the turnover
5092.23 of stem cells in both the skin and hair,
5096.38 and also turns out in nails.
5098.69 So if you've noticed that your skin,
5100.81 your hair and your nails look
better and turn over more,
5103.63 meaning grow faster in longer days,
5106.61 that is not on a coincidence.
5108.1 That is not just your perception.
5109.83 In fact, hair grows more,
skin turns over more,
5113.55 meaning it's going to look more youthful.
5114.92 You're going to essentially
remove older skin cells
5118.007 and replace them with new cells,
5120.36 and all the renewing cells
and tissues of our body
5123.7 are going to proliferate,
5124.82 are going to recreate themselves more
5127.45 when we're getting sufficient
UVB light to our eyes
5130.29 and also to our skin.
5132.01 And so while some of you
may think of light therapies
5136.23 such as red light
therapies or UVB therapies
5138.6 as kind of new agey, or just biohacking,
5141.05 again, a phrase I don't particularly like,
5142.95 this notion of biohacking,
5144.25 'cause it implies using
one thing for a purpose
5147.47 that it was never tended to have,
5150.7 well, it turns out that
UVB exposure and red light,
5154.3 as we'll soon see, is a very potent form
5157.55 of increasing things like
wound healing and skin health
5160.19 for very logical
mechanistically backed reasons.
5164.71 So while I can't account for everything
5167.52 that's being promoted out there
5168.67 in terms of this light source
5169.9 will help your skin look more youthful
5171.31 or will help heal your scars,
5174.4 the mechanistic basis for
light having those effects
5177.61 makes total sense.
5179.19 But what you should consider, however,
5181.29 is that if the particular light therapy
5183.75 that you're considering
involves very local application
5187.62 rather than illuminating
broad swaths of skin,
5192.61 and if it has no
involvement with the eyes,
5195.05 meaning there's no delivery
of UVB or red light
5198.9 or the other light therapy to the eyes,
5201.44 it's probably not going to
be as potent a treatment
5204.98 as would a more systemic activation
5208.16 of larger areas of skin and the eyes.
5211.13 Now, again, a cautionary note,
5212.85 I don't want people taking
technologies that were designed
5215.09 for local application and
beaming those into the eyes.
5218.3 That could be very, very bad
5219.5 and damaging to your
retinal and other tissues.
5222.55 Certainly, wouldn't want
you taking bright light
5225.22 of very high intensity of any kind
5227.48 and getting cavalier about that.
5229.6 Typically, the local
illumination of say a wound
5232.97 or a particular patch of acne
5234.41 or some other form of skin treatment
5237.05 involves very high intensity light.
5238.87 And if the intensity is too high,
5240.47 you can actually damage that skin.
5242.41 And so as we'll talk
about in a few moments,
5244.91 most of those therapies for modifying skin
5247.41 involve actually burning
off a small, very thin layer
5251.64 at the top of the epidermis
5253.51 in efforts to trigger the renewal
5255.67 or the activation of stem cells
5257.05 that will replenish that with new cells.
5259.89 So there's a fine line to be
had between light therapies
5264.37 that are very localized and intense,
5266.01 which are designed to damage skin
5268.19 and cause reactivation of new stem cells,
5272.54 whether that's hair cells
or skin cells, et cetera,
5274.78 versus systemic activation
across broad swaths of skin
5277.597 and the eyes.
5278.43 You really have to consider
this on a case-by-case basis,
5280.91 but at least for now just consider
5283.74 that increases in
hormones, reduction in pain
5288.24 by way of increases in enkephalin
5290.68 and other endogenous opioids,
5292.72 improving immune status
by activating the spleen,
5295.72 and so on, and so on
5297.41 really are all the downstream consequence
5299.58 of illuminating large swaths of skin
5301.95 and making sure that those
neurons within the eye
5303.98 get their adequate UVB exposure
5306.28 or other light wavelength exposure,
5308.27 not simply beaming a
particular wavelength of light
5311.38 at a particular location on the body
5313.01 and hoping that that
particular illumination
5315.41 at a particular location on the body
5317.15 is going to somehow change
the biology at that location.
5320.5 Our biology just really
doesn't work that way.
5323.35 It's possible, but in general,
5325.27 systemic effects through
broad scale illumination
5328.45 and illumination to the eye,
5329.73 combined with local
treatments are very likely
5332.32 to be the ones that have the most success.
5334.4 Now, I'd like to shift our attention
5335.73 to the effects of light
on mood more specifically.
5338.03 We talked about this
5338.863 in terms of seasonal effective disorder,
5340.72 but many of us don't suffer
5341.89 from seasonal effective disorder.
5343.41 So I'd like to drill a little deeper
5344.88 into how light impacts mood.
5347.67 And here, I want to, again,
paraphrase the statements
5351.79 of Dr. Samer Hattar
5354.5 at the National Institutes
of Mental Health,
5356.81 I should mention the director
of the chronobiology unit
5358.96 at the National Institutes
of Mental Health
5360.7 and perhaps one of the top one
to two to three world experts
5366.04 in how light can impact mood, appetite,
5368.23 circadian rhythms, and so forth.
5371.69 Samer stated on the podcast,
5373.07 and he said in various
other venues as well,
5376.24 that getting as much UVB light
in our eyes and on our skin
5380.6 in the early day and throughout the day
5382.41 as is safely possible is going
to be beneficial for mood.
5385.53 There's also another time of day,
5388.14 or rather I should say a time of night
5389.85 in which UVB can be leveraged
in order to improve mood,
5394.45 but it's actually the
inverse of everything
5396.37 we've been talking about up until now.
5399.41 We have a particular neural
circuit that originates
5402.52 with those melanopsin cells in our eye
5404.94 that bypass all the areas of the brain
5407.25 associated with circadian clocks,
5409.15 so everything related to
sleep and wakefulness,
5411.59 that's specifically
dedicated to the pathways
5414.8 involving the release of
molecules like dopamine,
5417.01 the neuromodulator that's
associated with motivation,
5419.94 with feeling good, with feeling
like there's possibility
5423.87 in the world, and so on and so forth,
5425.8 and other molecules as well,
5426.96 including serotonin and some
of those endogenous opioids
5429.75 that we talked about before.
5432.27 That particular pathway
involves a brain structure
5434.39 called the perihabenular nucleus.
5436.75 The perihabenular nucleus gets input
5439.74 from the cells in the eye
that respond to UVB light,
5443.44 and frankly, to bright light
of other wavelengths as well,
5446.79 'cause as you recall, if
a light is bright enough,
5449.49 even if it's not UV or blue light,
5451.36 it can activate those cells in the eye.
5453.87 Those cells in the eye
5454.77 communicate to the perihabenular nucleus.
5457.41 And as it turns out, if
this pathway is activated
5461.11 at the wrong time of each 24-hour cycle,
5464.78 mood gets worse, dopamine
output gets worse,
5469.78 molecules that are there
specifically to make us feel good,
5473.21 actually are reduced in their output.
5477.04 So while UVB exposure in the
morning and throughout the day
5481.4 is going to be very
important for elevating
5484.41 and maintaining elevated mood,
5486.53 avoiding UVB light at
night is actually a way
5490.87 in which we can prevent activation
5493.7 of this eye to perihabenular pathway
5496.92 that can actually turn on depression.
5498.93 To be very direct and succinct about this,
5501.68 avoid exposure to UVB light
from artificial sources
5505.85 between the hours of 10:00 pm and 4:00 am.
5508.48 And if you're somebody
who suffers from low mood
5511.82 and overall has a kind of mild depression
5514.71 or even severe depression,
5515.98 of course, please see a psychiatrist,
5517.93 see a trained psychologist,
get that treated,
5520.97 but you would do especially
well to avoid UVB exposure
5526.51 from artificial sources, not
just from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am,
5529.61 but really be careful about
getting too much exposure to UVB
5533.0 even in the late evening,
5534.41 so 8:00 pm perhaps to 4:00 am.
5537.22 I can't emphasize this enough,
5539.57 that if you view UVB light,
5541.79 you activate those neurons
in your eye very potently.
5544.57 And if those cells communicate
to the perihabenular nucleus,
5548.1 which they do,
5548.933 you will truncate or reduce
the amount of dopamine
5551.65 that you release.
5553.41 So if you want to keep your mood elevated,
5556.16 get a lot of light, UVB
light, throughout the day,
5558.92 and at night, really be cautious
about getting UVB exposure
5562.87 from artificial sources.
5564.16 Now let's say you're somebody
who has no issues with mood.
5566.96 You're just the happiest
person all year long,
5569.54 or maybe you just have subtle
variations in your mood.
5572.56 You feel great about that.
5575.03 Turns out that you still
want to be very careful
5577.94 about light exposure
5579.57 between the hours of 10:00
pm or so, and 4:00 am,
5582.87 in fact, even during sleep.
5585.03 There's a recent study that just came out
5586.84 in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences,
5589.75 and it's entitled Light
Exposure During Sleep
5592.76 Impairs Cardiometabolic Function.
5595.84 This is a very interesting study
5597.69 where they took human
subjects, young adults,
5600.22 and having them sleep in rooms
5602.65 that had different lighting conditions,
5604.04 either dim light or slightly bright light.
5607.92 Now, many people can't fall
asleep in brightly lit rooms,
5610.49 so they acknowledge this.
5611.978 These were not very brightly lit rooms.
5613.96 These were rooms that
had just a little bit
5616.26 of overhead room lighting, a hundred lux,
5619.26 which is not very bright at all.
5621.29 Or they had them sleep in a
room that had very dim light,
5623.92 which is less than three lux.
5625.8 If you want to get a sense
of how bright three lux is
5629.16 versus a hundred lux,
5630.78 I would encourage you to download
the free app Light Meter.
5633.91 I have no relationship to the app.
5635.42 It's a pretty cool app, however.
5636.58 I've used it for a long time,
5637.58 where you can basically point your phone
5640.08 at a particular light
source, sun or otherwise,
5642.36 and you just press the button
5643.29 and it'll give you an
approximate readout of lux,
5645.62 which is the light intensity
5647.72 that the phone happens
to be staring out at
5650.17 at that location.
5651.003 It's not exact, but it's a pretty good
5654.08 back-of-the-envelope
measure of light intensity.
5657.46 So these subjects were either
sleeping in a very dim room,
5660.41 three lux is very, very dim,
5662.18 or a somewhat dim room, a hundred lux.
5665.93 In this study, they measured
things like melatonin levels.
5669.21 They looked at heart rate,
5670.96 they looked at measures of
insulin and glucose management.
5675.94 Now, in previous episodes,
5678.07 I've talked about how
glucose, blood sugar,
5680.43 is regulated by insulin
5682.43 because you don't want your glucose levels
5683.96 to be too high, hyperglycemia,
or too low, hypoglycemia.
5687.58 And the hormone insulin is
involved in sequestering
5690.4 and shuttling glucose in the bloodstream.
5692.52 Basically, how well you manage
glucose in the bloodstream
5695.41 can be indirectly measured
by your insulin levels.
5698.49 And it's well known that sleep deprivation
5701.49 can disrupt glucose regulation by insulin.
5707.0 However, in this study,
subjects were sleeping
5709.4 the whole night through.
5710.233 It just so happens that some
of the subjects were sleeping
5712.17 in this very dimly lit room, three lux,
5713.937 and other subjects were sleeping
5715.41 in a somewhat dimly lit
room, a hundred lux.
5719.76 What's incredible about this study
5721.73 is that both rooms were
sufficiently dimmed
5724.18 that melatonin levels were
not altered in either case.
5727.51 This is really key.
5728.343 It's not as if one group
experienced a lot of bright light
5731.5 through their eyelids and others did not.
5733.64 Melatonin levels were not disrupted.
5735.57 And given how potently
light can inhibit melatonin,
5738.28 this speaks to the fact
5739.79 that this very dim condition of three lux
5742.52 and the somewhat dim
condition of a hundred lux
5744.89 was not actually perceived by the subjects
5748.07 nor was it disrupting
these hormone pathways.
5750.76 They also looked at glucose responses.
5753.29 They had people essentially
take a fasting glucose test
5756.48 in different conditions.
5757.38 I won't go into all the details,
5758.95 but here's what they found.
5760.41 In healthy adults, even
just one night of sleeping
5764.44 in a moderately lit environment,
5766.92 this hundred lux
environment, caused changes,
5770.93 increases in nighttime heart rate,
5772.63 which means that the
sympathetic nervous system
5774.44 was overly active as compared to people
5776.62 that slept in a completely dark
5778.34 or in a very, very dimly lit room.
5780.9 Decreases in heart rate variability,
5783.49 and here I should point out
that heart rate variability
5785.76 or HRV is a good thing, we
want heart rate variability.
5788.71 So they saw increases in heart rate,
5790.38 decreases in heart rate variability,
5792.48 and increases in next
morning insulin resistance,
5796.36 which is an indication that
glucose management is suffering.
5800.79 So this is powerful.
5803.33 The results of this study
essentially indicate
5805.86 that even just one night of
sleeping the whole night through
5809.14 in a dimly lit environment
is disrupting the way
5812.49 that our autonomic nervous
system is functioning,
5814.97 altering so called autonomic tone,
5817.55 making us less relaxed
is probably the best way
5820.3 to describe it,
5821.5 even though we are asleep,
5823.13 disrupting the way
5824.46 that our cardiometabolic
function operates,
5827.57 such that we have lower
heart rate variability
5829.86 and increased insulin resistance.
5832.91 This is not a good thing
for any of us to experience.
5835.69 So while we've mainly been talking
5837.63 about the positive effects of UVB light
5839.48 and other forms of light,
5841.21 now we have two examples.
5842.95 One from the work of Hattar and colleagues
5845.27 showing that UVB exposure
via the perihabenula
5848.8 can diminish the output of dopamine
5851.37 and other molecules that make us feel good
5853.09 if that UVB exposure is
in the middle of the night
5855.38 or late evening.
5856.81 And now we have yet
another study performed,
5859.33 in this case, in humans,
5860.84 indicating that even if we fall asleep
5862.957 and sleep the whole night through,
5864.58 if the room that we're
sleeping in has too many lux,
5867.54 too much light energy,
5868.86 that light energy is no doubt
going through the eyelids,
5871.86 which it can, activating
the particular cells
5874.93 in the eye that trigger an increase
5877.93 in sympathetic nervous system activation
5879.91 and disrupting our metabolism.
5882.37 And this study rests on a
number of other recent studies
5885.66 published in Cell, which
is a superb journal,
5887.96 and other journals, showing
that during the course
5890.21 of a healthy, deep night's sleep,
5893.09 our body actually transitions
5894.187 through various forms
of metabolic function.
5896.8 We actually experience
ketosis-like states.
5900.42 We experience glucogenesis.
5903.0 We experience different
forms of metabolism
5905.24 associated with different stages of sleep,
5907.23 not something that we're
going into in depth
5909.08 in this podcast, we will
in a future podcast.
5911.8 What this study shows is that
light exposure even in sleep
5915.97 is disrupting our autonomic, in this case,
5918.53 the sympathetic arm of the
autonomic nervous system
5920.95 in ways that are disrupting
metabolism, probably in sleep,
5924.28 but certainly outside of
sleep so that we wake up
5927.03 and have our first meal of the day.
5928.45 Or even if you're intermittent fasting,
5929.7 you eat that first meal of the day,
5931.32 if your sleep is taking
place in an environment
5934.31 that's overly illuminated,
5936.59 well, that's disrupting
your cardiac function
5939.31 and your metabolism.
5940.72 I've been talking a lot about UVB light,
5942.48 which is short wavelength light.
5944.15 So UV light, blue light,
5945.27 maybe even some blue green light,
5947.18 that's going to be short wavelength light.
5948.68 Now, I'd like to shift our attention
5949.8 to the other end of the spectrum,
5951.16 meaning the light spectrum,
5952.35 to talk about red light
and infrared light,
5954.36 which is long wavelength light.
5956.25 Many so-called low level light therapies,
5959.97 the acronym is LLLT, low
level light therapies,
5963.99 involve the use of red
light and infrared light.
5967.6 Sometimes, low level light
therapies involve the use of UVB,
5971.1 but more often than not these days,
5972.76 when we hear LLLT, low
level light therapy,
5975.76 it's referring to red light
5977.54 and near-infrared light therapies.
5981.95 Low level light therapies have
been shown to be effective
5984.61 for a huge number of biological phenomenon
5987.64 and medical treatments.
5989.42 I can't summarize all of those now.
5990.94 It would take me many, many hours.
5992.77 It would be an effective
episode for curing insomnia,
5995.41 but it wouldn't inform you
properly about the use of light
5998.81 for your health.
5999.8 Rather, I'd like to just emphasize
6001.38 some of the top contour of those studies
6003.55 and point out that for instance,
6006.01 low level light therapy
with infrared light
6008.16 has been shown to be effective
for the treatment of acne
6010.96 and other sorts of skin lesions.
6013.0 There have been some really
nice studies actually
6015.2 where they use subjects as
their own internal control.
6018.01 So people, believe it or not,
6019.15 agreed to have half of their face
6020.82 illuminated with red light
or near-infrared light,
6023.91 and the other half of their
face serve as a control,
6026.05 and to do that for
several weeks at a time.
6028.33 And you can see pretty
impressive reductions
6031.1 in skin lesions, reductions
in scars from acne,
6035.22 and reduction in acne lesions themselves,
6038.22 meaning the accumulation of new acne cysts
6041.02 with low level light therapy,
6042.57 using red light and infrared light.
6044.6 Sometimes however, there is
a resistance of that acne
6049.28 to the low level light therapy,
6050.62 such that people will get
an initial improvement,
6052.8 and then it'll go away despite
continuing the treatment.
6055.7 So you're probably asking, or
at least you should be asking,
6058.27 how is it that shining
red light on our skin
6060.77 can impact things like acne
and wound healing, et cetera?
6064.64 Well, to understand that,
we have to think back
6066.76 to the beginning of the episode
6068.37 where I described how
long wavelength light,
6070.73 such as red light and near-infrared light,
6073.1 which is even longer than red light,
6075.16 can pass through certain
surfaces, including our skin.
6079.18 So our skin has an epidermis,
which is on the outside,
6081.83 and the dermis, which
is in the deeper layers.
6084.44 Red light and infrared light can pass down
6087.15 into the deeper layers of our skin,
6089.06 where it can change the metabolic function
6091.437 of particular cells.
6092.9 So let's just take acne as an example.
6095.65 Within the dermis, the
deep layers of our skin,
6097.93 we have what are called sebaceous glands
6099.73 that actually make the oil
that is present in our skin.
6103.74 Those sebaceous glands are
often nearby hair follicles.
6106.71 So if you've ever had a
infected hair follicle,
6110.15 that's not a coincidence
6111.52 that hair follicles tend to get infected.
6113.12 Part of it is because there's
actually a portal down
6116.27 and around the hair follicle,
6117.128 but the sebaceous gland is
where the oil is created.
6120.55 That is going to give rise to,
for instance, acne lesions.
6123.8 Also, in the dermis, in the
deep layers of the skin,
6126.94 are the melanocytes.
6128.02 They're not just in the epidermis,
6128.96 they're also in the
deeper layers of the skin.
6131.82 And you have the stem cells that give rise
6134.78 to additional skin cells.
6136.86 If the top layers of the
epidermis are damaged,
6139.24 those stem cells can become activated.
6141.3 And you also have the stem cells
6143.57 that give rise to hair follicles.
6145.38 So by shining red light
or near-infrared light
6149.68 on a localized patch of skin,
6151.63 provided that red light is
not of such high intensity
6154.98 that it burns the skin,
6156.55 but is of sufficient
intensity that it provides
6159.15 just a little bit of damage to
the upper layers of the skin,
6162.48 the epidermis,
6163.86 and that it triggers
certain biological pathways
6167.24 within the cells of the sebaceous gland
6169.54 and the stem cells within
the hair cell niche
6172.51 and the stem cells in skin,
6174.05 what happens is the top layers of the skin
6176.69 are basically burned off
by a very low level of burn
6180.51 and/or the cells in the deeper layer
6182.46 start to churn out new cells,
6183.93 which go and rescue the lesion,
6187.4 essentially clear out the
lesion and replace that lesion
6190.67 with healthy skin cells.
6193.62 This does work in the
context of wound healing,
6197.47 getting scars to disappear.
6199.05 It also works to remove certain
patches of pigmentation.
6203.01 There are sometimes cases
6204.01 where people will get a red blotchiness
6206.9 due to certain skin conditions
6208.61 or some darker pigmentation
that they want remove,
6211.37 or that they need removed,
6212.61 because it's a potential
skin cancer threat.
6216.07 Now, how is red light actually doing it
6217.88 within the cells of the sebaceous gland,
6219.55 the stem cells, et cetera?
6221.04 Well, long wavelength light
6223.22 can actually get deep into the skin,
6225.22 I mentioned that before,
6226.053 but can also get into individual cells
6229.8 and can access the so-called organelles,
6231.76 which I described at the
beginning of the episode.
6233.38 In particular, they can
access the mitochondria,
6235.83 which are responsible for producing ATP.
6238.56 Now, the simple way to think about this
6240.58 for sake of this discussion
is that as cells age,
6246.16 and in particular, in very
metabolically active cells,
6250.36 they accumulate what are called ROSs,
6252.83 reactive oxygen species.
6255.01 And as reactive oxygen species go up,
6258.81 ATP energy production in
those cells tends to go down.
6262.39 It's a general statement,
6263.44 but it's a general statement
that in most cases is true.
6267.21 There are some minor exceptions
that don't concern us
6269.91 that have to do with cell
types different than the ones
6271.963 that I'm talking about now.
6273.57 So the way to think about
this is that red light passes
6275.9 into the deeper layers of the skin,
6278.02 activates mitochondria,
which increases ATP,
6280.97 and directly or indirectly reduces
6283.36 these reactive oxygen species.
6285.09 These reactive oxygen
species are not good.
6288.25 We don't want them.
6289.39 They cause cellular
damage, cellular death.
6292.39 And for the most part just inhibit the way
6295.15 that our cells work.
6296.7 So if you've heard of red light
6298.59 or near-infrared light therapies
6300.8 designed to heal skin
or improve skin quality
6304.06 or remove lesions,
6305.08 or get rid of scars or
unwanted pigmentation,
6307.9 that is not pseudoscience,
that is not woo science.
6312.39 That is grounded in the very
biology of how light interacts
6315.67 with mitochondria and
reactive oxygen species.
6318.41 Some of you may also find
it interesting to note
6320.58 that some of the cream-based treatments
6322.77 for acne, for instance,
6324.29 like retinoic acid, Retin-A,
6326.63 is actually a derivative of vitamin A.
6330.07 And the pathway involving
retinoic acid and vitamin A,
6333.76 believe it or not,
6334.593 is very similar to the
natural biological pathway
6338.56 by which photopigments in the
eye convert light information
6341.9 into biological changes
within those cells.
6344.67 So the key point here is that light
6347.58 is activating particular pathways in cells
6350.3 that can either drive death of cells
6352.86 or can make those cells
essentially younger
6355.73 by increasing ATP
6357.73 by way of improving
mitochondrial function.
6360.57 And in recent years, there have been some
6362.53 just beautiful examples that exist,
6365.41 not only in the realm of skin biology,
6367.75 but in the realm of
neurobiology whereby red light
6371.83 and near-infrared light
can actually be used
6373.81 to enhance the function of the cells
6375.66 that, for instance, allow us to see better
6377.81 and indeed cells that
allow us to think better.
6380.64 So now I'd like to review those data
6382.35 because not only are they
interesting in their own right,
6385.69 but they also point to
some very interesting
6388.53 and powerful application of
low-cost or zero-cost tools
6391.96 that we can use to improve our vision.
6394.5 If you are somebody who's
interested in the use of red light
6397.05 or near-infrared light,
6398.91 so-called LLLT, low level light therapies,
6401.77 for treatment of dermatologic issues,
6404.16 so anything related to skin,
6405.95 I will include a link to a
excellent set of reviews.
6409.2 The first one is Light-emitting
Diodes in Dermatology:
6412.29 A Systematic Review of
Randomized Controlled Trials.
6415.26 That one includes review of a
very large number of studies,
6418.52 came out just a few years ago in 2018,
6420.87 and I think is very clearly
6422.71 and cleanly laid out for anyone to access.
6425.23 And you can see the degree of effects
6426.7 of red light, for instance,
6427.533 on treatment of acne
or scarring, et cetera.
6429.4 And I'll also provide a
link to another review,
6432.06 which is Low-level Light Therapy in Skin:
6434.35 Stimulating, Healing, and Restoring.
6436.12 So for those of you that
are interested, again,
6438.13 in dermatologic issues
6439.48 and the kind of restoring youthfulness
6441.98 and the kind of general themes
of anti-aging and longevity
6445.87 and how red light therapies
can be used for that,
6448.77 I would encourage you to
take a look at those reviews.
6451.38 What you're going to find
is that rarely, if ever,
6455.28 is there a study looking at whole body
6457.19 red light illumination
6458.88 for sake of treating and improving skin.
6461.95 And I mention this because
I get a lot of questions
6464.35 about infrared sauna
and global illumination
6468.19 with red lights.
6469.44 We'll talk more about cases
6471.2 where global illumination
of your whole body
6473.43 or your whole face with
red lights might be useful,
6476.59 but in terms of infrared sauna,
6478.42 I've mentioned on this podcast before,
6479.92 and I will certainly go deeper on this
6481.43 in an upcoming episode,
6482.44 all about the use of heat and temperature
6484.88 for augmenting our biology,
6486.98 but in general, infrared
saunas don't get hot enough,
6491.88 temperature-wise, in order to trigger some
6494.93 of the important effects on growth hormone
6496.81 and heat shock proteins and
some of the other things
6498.8 that sauna has been shown
to be excellent for.
6501.99 That's a general statement.
6502.93 I realize there are some infrared saunas
6504.55 that do get hot enough.
6506.44 There are very few data on the use
6509.41 of whole body illumination
with infrared saunas
6512.62 that really point to any specific
6514.68 mechanistically supported effects.
6517.43 Almost all the positive effects
that you're going to see
6519.41 of red light and
low-level light therapies,
6521.9 certainly the ones
discussed in the reviews
6523.35 that I just mentioned,
6524.22 are going to be the consequence
6526.84 of very directed illumination
of particular patches of skin
6530.74 that are seeking repair,
6532.19 that people are seeking the repair of.
6534.3 So again, I don't want to
disparage infrared saunas,
6538.05 but in general, they don't get hot enough
6539.41 to trigger most of the positive effects
6541.1 that sauna have been demonstrated to have.
6543.9 And it's unclear at all
as to whether or not
6547.03 they can enhance skin
quality, youthfulness,
6549.38 restore top layers of
skin that are damaged,
6554.2 repair acne, et cetera.
6555.76 So more on heat saunas and infrared saunas
6558.14 and their comparison
in an upcoming episode.
6560.72 So let's talk about a
clear set of examples
6563.58 where red light and near-infrared light
6566.81 have been shown to have
positive effects on our health.
6570.41 And these are the data that I
referred to at the beginning
6572.92 of the episode from Dr. Glen Jeffery
6575.21 at University College London,
6577.07 who, again, is a longstanding member
6580.62 of the neuroscience community,
6581.71 working on visual neuroscience,
6583.26 and who over the last decade or so
6585.45 has really emphasized the
exploration of red light
6588.57 and near-infrared light for restoration
6591.55 of neuronal function as we age.
6594.02 This is absolutely critical.
6595.24 We know that we don't
accumulate many new brain cells
6599.41 as we get older.
6600.243 And in some areas of our nervous system,
6602.27 such as our neural retina,
which is the part of our eye,
6605.33 that's responsible for
translating light information
6607.63 to electrical signals so that we can see,
6610.2 we don't get any new cells after the time
6612.81 in which we were born.
6614.02 So the ability to keep our neurons healthy
6616.6 is extremely important
for our visual system,
6619.43 extremely important for our hippocampus,
6622.19 an area of the brain involved in memory.
6624.3 And I should just mention that even
6626.61 if people don't get Alzheimer's,
6628.08 there's always going to be some degree
6630.01 of age-related dementia.
6631.9 Sadly, nobody is as cognitively sharp
6635.7 in the years before they die,
6636.99 as they are 20 years before that.
6639.24 It's just never the case.
6640.36 We're all getting worse at thinking,
6642.55 feeling, perceiving, et cetera.
6644.53 The question is how quickly
we are getting worse.
6646.73 So any mechanism by which we can preserve
6649.59 or reverse neuronal function
6651.64 turns out to be immensely beneficial.
6655.4 The Jeffery Lab has published
two studies in recent years
6659.02 on humans that looked
directly, no pun intended,
6663.54 at how red light and near-infrared light
6665.83 can improve visual function.
6668.33 I'm going to describe the
parameters of those studies.
6670.35 And then I'm going to describe
what they found, exactly.
6674.47 The mechanistic motivation
for these studies, again,
6678.35 traces back to this effect
of light on mitochondria.
6682.52 So to go a little bit deeper
6683.5 into that mechanism just briefly
6685.92 so that you can frame
any potential protocol
6688.17 that you would develop,
6690.64 when light arrives on
cells, including neurons,
6696.05 that light can penetrate into the cells
6697.65 if it's of the appropriate wavelength.
6699.02 Red light can do that,
it can get into cells,
6700.82 it can access the mitochondria,
6702.27 it can increase ATP.
6704.9 In general, anytime ATP is doing its thing
6707.87 to increase energy in cells,
6710.1 it's involving this thing
called cytochrome c,
6714.48 which is an oxidase.
6715.64 Anytime you hear ase, A-S-E, in biology,
6718.77 it's going to be an enzyme.
6719.83 It's involved in some process
of degrading a molecule
6722.97 and creating another molecule, typically.
6725.24 So ATP and cytochrome c
is going to give you ATP.
6728.48 Now, that's a great thing,
but it creates a byproduct.
6733.33 It breaks things down, such
that you get these ROSs,
6736.12 these reactive oxygen species.
6738.12 And those reactive oxygen species,
6739.9 for those of you that want to know,
6741.19 are involved in things
like redox signaling.
6743.9 And reactive oxygen
species actually change
6747.32 which genes are made in a cell.
6749.61 So the goal of any
treatment is to keep neurons
6752.3 or other cells youthful
and functioning well,
6755.88 and to prevent or reverse aging,
6758.92 is going to be to increase ATP
6761.35 and to reduce reactive oxygen species,
6764.18 and in doing so, to disrupt
some of the normal pathways
6768.53 associated with aging.
6771.91 The Jeffery Lab approached these studies
6773.64 with that understanding
of how mitochondria
6775.84 and reactive oxygen species and ATP work.
6778.42 And what they did was exquisitely simple
6781.62 to the point of being elegant.
6782.91 And what they found was
really, really exciting.
6785.29 What they did is they had people,
6788.65 subjects that were either
younger, so in their 20s,
6791.45 or 40 years old or older,
6795.03 view red light of about 670 nanometers.
6798.01 670 nanometers would
appear red to you and me.
6801.54 They, they had them do that, excuse me,
6803.66 at a distance that was
safe for their eyes,
6805.66 so at about a foot away.
6807.77 Now, a foot away from a
very intense red light
6811.73 could actually be damaging to the eyes,
6813.06 so they had them do this
at about a foot away
6815.24 from a red light that was
of low enough intensity
6817.99 that it did not damage the eyes.
6819.99 And they had them do that anywhere
6821.31 from two to three minutes per day.
6824.15 And in one study, they had them do that
6825.88 for a long period of
time of about 12 weeks.
6828.39 And in the other study,
6829.223 they had them do that just
for a couple of weeks.
6831.72 What's remarkable is that
when you collapse the results
6834.6 across these two studies,
6836.13 what they found is that when
looking at these subjects
6838.71 ranging from 28 years old
to about 72 years old,
6842.92 the major findings were
that in individuals
6846.43 40 years old or older,
6848.96 so in the 40 to 72-year-old bracket,
6852.97 but not in the subjects
younger than 40 years old,
6856.65 they saw an improvement
in visual function.
6860.16 That improvement in visual function
6861.5 was an improvement in visual acuity,
6863.82 meaning the ability to
resolve fine detail,
6866.9 and using a particular
measure of visual function,
6870.52 which is called the Tritan exam.
6874.12 T-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan exam,
6876.94 which specifically addresses the function
6880.37 of the so-called short wavelength cones,
6882.4 the ones that respond
to green and blue light,
6885.04 they saw a 22% improvement
in visual acuity,
6888.88 which in the landscape of visual testing
6892.27 is an extremely exciting result.
6895.4 Okay, so I think in most studies
of improvements of vision,
6899.26 you'd be very excited to see
an improvement of 5% or 10%.
6903.35 So a 22% improvement in visual acuity,
6906.56 even though it's in
this very specific form
6909.02 of visual testing, this Tritan
exam or this Tritan score,
6913.76 well, that turns out
to be very significant
6916.05 and translates to the real
world in an important way.
6920.23 In particular, as we age,
6923.11 we tend to lose certain
neurons within our retina,
6926.16 but we don't tend to lose cones.
6928.55 We tend to lose rods.
6930.21 We tend to lose other
cells within the retina,
6932.32 including the cells that
connect the eye to the brain,
6934.29 the so-called ganglion cells.
6935.84 Cones, for whatever reason,
6937.62 are pretty resilient to age-related loss.
6940.26 However, because rods and cones both
6944.51 are not just among the most
metabolically active cells
6947.76 in your entire body,
6949.15 but the most metabolically
active cells in your entire body
6953.01 that's right, your rods and
cones are the cells that demand,
6956.25 and that use the most energy
of all the cells in your body,
6960.98 not your skin cells,
6961.86 not your spleen, not your stomach cells.
6963.76 Even if you talk a lot,
6964.96 not the cells that are
responsible for moving your mouth.
6967.18 It is the rods and cones
of your neural retina
6969.72 that are responsible for
using the most amount of ATP
6973.047 and energy in your entire body.
6975.66 And because of that,
6977.01 those cells tend to accumulate a lot
6979.71 of reactive oxygen species as we age.
6983.18 Red light of the sort
used in these studies
6985.41 was able to reduce the amount
of reactive oxygen species
6989.97 in the rods and cones and
to rescue the function
6993.38 of this particular cone type,
6995.24 the short wavelength and
medium wavelength cones,
6997.06 which if you think about the study,
6998.5 is a little bit surprising,
6999.75 because it was red light
and near-infrared light,
7002.38 not short wavelength light,
7004.12 that was used in order to
create this improvement
7007.04 in cellular function.
7008.55 But if you step back a little bit further,
7011.01 it makes perfect sense because
there's nothing specific
7014.75 about the red light in the sense
7016.27 that it gets delivered only to red cones.
7019.59 That red light and near-infrared
light is being absorbed
7022.41 by all the photoreceptors within the eye,
7024.69 the rods and the blue cones
7026.67 and the green cones and the red cones.
7028.46 It's just that the red cones
absorb that light best.
7031.8 So the important takeaway here
7034.58 is that viewing red light
and near-infrared light
7037.88 at a distance at which it is safe
7039.82 for just a couple of minutes each day
7042.46 allowed a reversal of the
aging process of these neurons,
7045.94 which some people have
heard me say before,
7048.66 and I'll just say it again,
7050.35 the retina, including your photoreceptors,
7052.23 are not just connected to your brain.
7054.21 They're not just near your brain.
7055.31 They are actual central
nervous system tissue.
7057.45 They are the only two
pieces of your brain,
7059.59 meaning your neuroretinas
are the only two pieces
7061.5 of your brain that reside
outside your skull,
7063.33 or at least outside the cranial vault.
7065.05 So here we're seeing a
reversal of the aging process
7068.3 in neurons by shining red
light on those neurons.
7071.6 Now, of course, the Jeffery Lab
7074.1 is primarily interested in vision,
7075.75 and humans are most dependent on vision
7078.09 as a sense to navigate
the world and survive.
7079.91 So this is really wonderful.
7081.27 Here, we're looking at a therapy
7083.07 that can reverse age-related vision loss,
7086.58 at least in some individuals.
7088.73 But as you can imagine,
7089.61 the study was also done on these cells
7090.99 because they reside outside the skull
7093.11 and you can shine light
directly on them, right?
7095.36 I'm sure that there are
many people out there
7097.02 who are interested in how
they can improve the function,
7099.47 say, of the neurons in their
brain responsible for memory.
7102.62 And in a few minutes,
7103.453 I'll describe the non-invasive
applications of light
7107.02 to try and restore the function
of those cells as well.
7111.08 So a little bit more about the
studies from the Jeffery Lab.
7115.94 One of the things that they observed was
7118.2 a reduction in so-called
drusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.
7121.78 Drusen are little fatty deposits,
7125.77 little cholesterol deposits,
7127.47 that accumulate in the eye as we age.
7129.92 We've all heard about cholesterol
7131.58 within our veins and arteries
7133.13 and how that can clog
our veins and arteries
7135.69 and how, of course, clogging
of veins and arteries
7138.76 is not a good thing.
7139.79 Well, our neural retina
being so metabolically active
7142.58 requires a lot of blood flow.
7144.17 It's heavily vascularized,
7146.18 and drusen are a special
form of cholesterol
7149.12 that accumulate in the eye.
7151.3 As it turns out, these red light
7152.93 and near-infrared light therapies
7155.06 explored by the Jeffery Lab
7156.5 were able to actually reduce or reverse
7159.61 some of the accumulation of drusen.
7161.63 And so in addition to reducing
reactive oxygen species,
7165.67 the idea in mind now is that red light
7168.01 may actually reduce cholesterol deposits
7171.56 and reactive oxygen species
7174.12 in order to improve neuronal function.
7176.56 So what should you and
I do with these results?
7178.76 Or should we do anything
with these results?
7180.28 Well, first of all, I want to emphasize
7182.24 that even though these
studies are very exciting,
7184.72 they are fairly recent.
7185.97 And so more data, as always, are needed.
7189.01 There's some additional
features of these studies
7190.69 that I think are also
important to consider.
7192.63 First of all, the exposure to red light
7195.82 needed to happen early in the day,
7198.41 at least within the first
three hours of waking.
7202.04 How would one do that?
7203.14 Well, nowadays there are a number
7204.67 of different red light panels
7206.64 and different red light sources
7208.91 that certainly fall within
the range of red light
7211.78 and near-infrared light
that one could use.
7214.3 I don't have any affiliation
to any companies or products
7217.74 that promote or make
those red light therapies.
7221.67 I do own a red light panel,
7223.43 so I confess I have started
using this protocol.
7225.95 I am older than 40 years old.
7227.82 I also have been experimenting
with these red light panels
7230.93 as a way of addressing other
changes in biological tissues,
7235.55 for which I'm doing blood work, et cetera.
7237.18 And I'm going to talk about
that in a future episode,
7239.52 but that, of course, is
what I call anecdata.
7241.68 It only relates to my experience.
7243.22 So today, and certainly on all episodes
7246.42 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
7247.74 we emphasize peer-reviewed
studies almost exclusively,
7250.75 talking about anecdata
7252.05 only when highlighting it as anecdata.
7254.87 So if you're somebody who wants
7256.52 to explore red light therapy,
here's what you need to do.
7259.63 You need to make sure that
that red light source,
7262.15 whatever source you happen to use,
7264.19 whether or not you
purchase it or make one...
7265.54 And in fact, these red light sources
7267.3 are very, very easy to make.
7268.89 You could essentially
take a bright flashlight
7271.63 and cover it with a film or a filter
7274.13 that would only allow
particular long wavelengths
7277.42 to pass through.
7278.253 This would be very easy to look up online
7279.88 and figure out how to do this.
7280.75 You could probably do this for,
you know, just a few dollars
7283.55 or you could purchase a red light unit
7285.51 if that was within your budget
7287.47 and something that you're interested in.
7289.0 You want to make sure
that it's not so bright
7290.84 that you're damaging your eye.
7292.61 A good rule of thumb is that something
7294.36 isn't painful to look at.
7295.92 And in fact, I should just emphasize
7297.4 that any time you look
at any light source,
7299.56 sunlight or otherwise, that's painful
7301.5 and makes you want to
squint or close your eyes,
7303.05 that means it's too bright to look at
7304.91 without closing your eyes.
7306.02 Okay, that's sort of a duh,
7307.42 but I would loathe to think
7308.96 that anyone would harm themselves
7310.42 with bright light in any way.
7311.77 I don't just say that to protect us.
7312.98 I say that to protect you, of course,
7314.87 because you are responsible
for your health.
7316.73 And again, retinal
neurons do not regenerate.
7319.32 Once they are gone and
dead, they do not come back.
7322.17 There's no technology to replace them
7323.78 at this current state in time.
7326.27 So please don't damage your retinas.
7328.4 So is a red light source safe to look at
7330.87 if it is not painful to look at?
7333.5 Chances are it is.
7334.58 And yet I would still encourage you
7336.02 to talk to your optometrist
or ophthalmologist
7339.22 before getting into any
extensive protocols.
7341.94 But if you are still determined
7343.23 to pursue the sorts of protocols
7345.05 that are in the Jeffery studies,
7346.27 certainly we'll provide
a link to those studies.
7348.45 Again, it involved looking
at these red light panels,
7351.17 blinking aloud for two
minutes to three minutes
7356.3 every morning for a period
of two weeks or more.
7361.65 And if you're older than 40,
7364.87 that could very well have an effect.
7366.24 If you're longer, younger
than 40, excuse me,
7368.56 that's unlikely to have an effect.
7370.8 At least that was what was observed
7372.5 in these particular studies.
7374.11 The lights were not flashing.
7375.56 It was continuous illumination.
7377.26 Again, you're allowed to blink.
7378.84 It does not have to even
be direct illumination.
7380.66 It can be somewhat indirect illumination,
7382.5 much as we described for
the use of UVB light before.
7386.26 The wavelength of light is important.
7388.23 It is red light and near-infrared light
7390.22 that is going to be
effective in this scenario.
7394.05 The authors of this study
emphasized that it was red light
7396.76 of 670 nanometers in wavelength
7400.27 and near-infrared light of
790 nanometers in wavelength
7405.81 that were effective
7406.87 and that those wavelengths
could be complimentary.
7409.76 That's probably why, or
maybe it's just coincidental,
7413.24 but it's a fortunate coincidence
7415.27 that a lot of the commercially
available red light panels
7417.73 that you'll find out there
7418.563 combine both red light
and near-infrared light.
7421.51 However, I want to emphasize
that most of the panels
7424.31 that are commercially available
7426.12 are going to be too bright to
safely look at very close up.
7430.52 And in fact, that's why most
of those red light panels
7433.04 are designed for illumination of the skin
7435.01 and oftentimes arrive in their packaging
7437.56 with eye protectors that
are actually designed
7440.08 to shield out all the red light.
7441.8 So take the potential dangers
of excessive illumination
7446.26 of the eyes with any
wavelength of light seriously.
7449.29 But if you're going to explore
670 and 790 nanometer light
7452.85 for sake of enhancing neuronal function,
7456.38 set it at a distance that's
comfortable to look at,
7458.69 and that doesn't force you to squint
7460.38 or doesn't make you feel
uncomfortable physically,
7462.98 as if you need to turn away
7465.51 during the period
7466.343 of that two to three-minute
illumination each day.
7470.25 In terms of turning away from light,
7472.43 I'll just briefly mention
that that is not an accident
7476.04 or a coincidence that
you have that response
7477.81 to very bright light.
7479.03 There is a so-called
photic avoidance pathway
7482.03 that involves cells within your retina,
7483.68 these ganglion cells that communicate
7485.29 with yet another brain station,
7488.15 a certain area of your
thalamus that communicate
7490.98 to areas of your brain that
are associated with pain.
7493.61 So literally that can trigger headache,
7495.38 and that can trigger the squint reflex.
7498.42 Biology is just beautiful in this way.
7500.47 Too much light is bad for us
in that it can damage our eyes
7503.52 and other aspects of our body.
7505.19 So if we look at a
light that's too bright,
7507.43 our eyes send a signal to the brain
7509.02 that gives us a sort of a headache
7510.41 and a desire to squint and turn away.
7512.14 So that can be a useful guide
7514.08 in terms of gauging how
bright a light should be
7516.74 or at least how far away you
should be from a bright source
7520.02 in order to safely engage
with that light source.
7523.14 So the studies I just
described, once again,
7525.92 involve the use of red
light early in the day
7528.02 within three hours of waking
7529.43 and are for the sake of
improving neuronal function.
7531.8 Red light has also been
shown to be beneficial
7535.81 late in the day and even
in the middle of the night.
7538.2 And when I say middle of the night,
7540.3 I'm referring to studies that
explore the use of red light
7543.13 for shift workers.
7544.64 I know that most people are not working
7546.42 in the middle of the night,
at least I hope they're not,
7548.07 but some of you may do
that from time to time.
7550.47 All-nighters for studying,
7551.48 I confess I still pull
all-nighters every once in a while
7553.61 to prepare things like
podcasts and other deadlines.
7556.6 I really try not to, happens
less and less as I get older,
7559.78 because I think I get more disciplined
7561.59 and/or less good at pulling all-nighters.
7565.01 But I realize that many
people are doing shift work,
7567.38 or they have to work
certainly past 10:00 pm.
7569.79 Or maybe they're taking
care of young children
7571.65 in the middle of the night,
and they have to be up.
7574.09 In that case, red light can
actually be very beneficial.
7576.45 And nowadays there are a
lot of sources of red light
7579.05 available just as red light bulbs.
7580.88 You don't need a panel.
7581.97 So what I'm basically saying
is that it can be beneficial
7585.26 to use red lights at night.
7588.14 The study I'd like to emphasize
in this context is entitled,
7590.83 Red Light: A Novel
Non-pharmacological Intervention
7594.21 to Promote Alertness in Shift Workers.
7596.723 It's a beautiful study.
7598.04 They explored the use of
different wavelengths of light,
7601.4 so blue light of 460 nanometers
7603.93 or red light or dim white light,
7606.74 of different brightnesses, et cetera,
7609.54 and looked at things like melatonin.
7612.74 How much does light of a given color
7615.19 and intensity suppress melatonin?
7616.85 They looked at cortisol, a stress hormone.
7618.62 They looked at wakefulness,
7620.37 how much or to what degree
could a given color of light
7623.64 increase wakefulness at
different hours of the day?
7626.25 The takeaway from this
study is very clear.
7628.34 If you need to be awake late
at night for sake of shift work
7631.393 or studying or taking care
of children, et cetera,
7634.81 red light is going to be your best choice
7637.54 because if the red light
is sufficiently dim,
7642.15 it's not going to inhibit
melatonin production,
7645.04 and it's not going to
increase cortisol at night.
7648.11 Cortisol should be high early in the day,
7650.84 or at least should be elevated relative
7652.39 to other times of day if you are healthy.
7654.52 A late shifted increase
in cortisol, however,
7656.87 9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol,
7659.06 is well known to be
associated with depression
7662.15 and other aspects of mental health,
7664.36 or I should say mental illness.
7666.4 So if you do need to be awake
at night or even all night,
7670.14 red light is going to be
the preferred light source.
7673.66 And in terms of how bright to make it,
7675.41 well, as dim as you can,
7678.18 while still being able
to perform the activities
7680.09 that you need to perform.
7680.923 That's going to be your best guide.
7683.09 I'll provide a link to this study as well.
7685.46 Again, it's a really important study
7688.15 because it emphasized that
there are forms of light,
7690.36 red light, provided it's dim,
7692.28 that can allow you to
stimulate the alertness
7695.42 that light landing on
the eyes can provide.
7699.13 So it allows you to stay awake
7700.23 and to do whatever work
that you need to do.
7702.55 It does not seem to alter
melatonin production,
7706.07 so that's good.
7706.903 It does not seem to alter levels
7708.92 or timing of cortisol production.
7711.04 So yet another case where
red light used correctly
7714.72 can be beneficial.
7715.83 Up until now, we've been talking
7717.04 about the effects of shining
different wavelengths of light
7719.785 on the skin or on our eyes
7723.16 and the downstream health
consequences of that illumination.
7727.61 However, one of the most important goals
7729.6 of science and medicine is to figure out
7732.05 how to change the health of our brain.
7734.62 And of course, our brain is
contained within our skull,
7738.28 and therefore we can't just shine light
7741.21 onto the outside of our head
7743.49 and expect it to change the activity
7745.41 of neurons deep within the brain,
7747.03 unless those neurons are
linked up with our eyes
7751.59 or with our skin.
7752.62 And as it turns out, even
though there are a lot
7754.43 of brain areas that are
connected through neural circuits
7757.71 and hormone circuits through our eye,
7759.61 and believe it or not, also to our skin,
7762.28 many brain areas are not.
7765.86 Brain areas such as the hippocampus,
7767.83 which is involved in learning and memory,
7770.28 brain areas such as our neocortex,
7773.22 well, some areas of our neocortex
such as our visual cortex
7776.51 are indirectly linked to our eyes,
7778.41 so if we shine light in our eyes,
7779.66 we can change the activity
of neurons in our neocortex,
7782.45 but there are other brain areas
7784.97 that are not directly or
even indirectly connected
7788.86 to our visual system,
7790.1 not at least in any immediate way.
7793.14 So that raises the question
7794.14 of how do you change the
activity of neurons in the brain?
7796.45 Well, there's pharmacology.
7798.14 You can take pills, you can inject drugs
7801.1 that will change the
pharmacology of neurons
7802.657 and the way they operate and fire.
7804.86 Of course, antidepressants
are one such instance,
7807.81 opioid drugs are another.
7809.75 There's a huge array of
psychoactive compounds,
7812.74 meaning compounds that
will change the levels
7814.73 of chemicals in your brain.
7816.8 Some of those work,
7817.68 many of them also carry side effects.
7820.73 It's all rather indirect,
7822.58 meaning you have lots of different cells
7824.36 in different areas of your brain
7825.34 that utilize the same chemicals.
7826.67 So a drug, for instance,
to increase serotonin
7829.1 for sake of improving depression
7831.54 will also often have the effect
7833.59 of reducing certain neurons
7837.02 output of serotonin in the hippocampus
7839.01 and cause changes in
appetite or changes in libido
7841.3 and so on and so forth.
7843.49 You could imagine using
electrical stimulation,
7845.29 putting wires into the brain
7846.48 and stimulating specific brain areas
7848.55 in order to activate the
neurons in those brain areas.
7851.36 And certainly that works and
has been done experimentally
7854.01 and is done during
neurosurgery exams, et cetera,
7856.9 but involves removing a piece of skull.
7859.65 So that's not very practical.
7861.34 In principle, light
would be a wonderful way
7864.39 to modulate the activity of
neurons deep within the brain.
7868.51 But again, the skull is in the way.
7871.56 Recent studies, however,
have figured out ways
7874.43 that light can be delivered to the eyes
7876.73 to change global patterns
of firing in the brain
7880.25 in ways that can be
beneficial to the brain.
7882.69 And the work that I'm referring to now
7885.53 is mainly the work of Li-Huei Tsai at MIT,
7888.6 Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and her colleagues.
7892.21 And what they've discovered
that there's a particular
7894.88 pattern of brain activity
called gamma activity.
7898.97 Gamma activity is one so-called wavelength
7902.1 of electrical activity in the brain,
7904.24 so not wavelengths of light,
7905.27 but wavelengths of electrical
activity in the brain
7908.01 that can be restorative
for certain aspects
7910.55 of learning and memory
7911.6 and can actually help create
molecular changes in neurons
7915.21 that lead to clearance of debris
7917.65 and even reductions in
age-related cognitive decline.
7921.8 So the way to think about brain
waves and brain oscillations
7926.97 is that neurons are electrically active,
7929.32 that involves chemicals, et cetera.
7931.15 And they can be active in
very slow, big waveforms.
7934.877 So you can think of, you
know, Delta waves, meaning,
7938.31 so you can imagine a wave
of electrical activity
7940.43 that comes along very infrequently.
7942.24 So a given neuron fires,
7944.28 and then some period of time later fires,
7946.97 and then some period of
time even later fires.
7949.73 Or you can imagine that that
same cell is very active,
7952.55 fires, fires, fires, fires, fires.
7954.39 You can imagine if it's firing very often,
7956.05 it's going to be short wavelength, right?
7958.45 Shorter gaps between firing.
7960.38 Or if it's firing very seldom,
7963.6 you're going to think about that
7965.51 as longer wavelength firing.
7967.31 Turns out that gamma waves
are one pattern of firing
7971.07 that lead to downstream
metabolic functions
7974.81 and biological functions that
end up clearing away debris
7977.38 that's associated with aging in cells
7980.25 and that also lead to molecular changes
7983.34 that enhance the kind of
youthfulness of neurons,
7986.43 so to speak.
7989.23 How do we induce gamma
oscillations within the brain?
7992.45 Well, what Li-Huei Tsai and colleagues
7995.73 have beautifully shown
7997.26 is that by delivering certain
patterns of light flicker,
8002.08 so lights going on and off
at a particular frequency,
8005.35 the brain as a whole starts to entrain,
8008.53 meaning it matches to
those particular patterns
8010.9 of light flicker,
8011.733 even though many of the
brain areas that do this
8014.4 are not directly within the
visual system or visual pathway.
8018.71 So the studies that I'm
referring to are several,
8022.09 but the one that I'd like
to highlight is entitled,
8023.95 Gamma Entrainment Binds
Higher-Order Brain Regions
8026.82 and Offers Neuroprotection.
8029.318 What they essentially did
8030.67 was to expose subjects to 40 hertz,
8034.87 which is a particular
frequency of illumination,
8038.12 to the eyes.
8039.17 So it's light goes on, light goes off,
8041.36 light goes on, light goes off
at a frequency of 40 hertz.
8046.25 And when they did that and
they recorded the activity
8049.31 of neurons within the brain,
8050.41 not just within the
visual areas of the brain,
8052.96 but within other areas as well,
8054.87 they observed increased
gamma oscillations,
8058.86 meaning that the electrical
activity of the brain at large
8063.07 started to match to the patterns of light
8066.11 that were delivered to the eyes.
8068.02 This is really exciting and very unique
8069.77 from the different types of phototherapies
8071.72 that we've been talking
about up until now.
8073.22 All the patterns of phototherapy
8075.21 that we've been talking about up until now
8076.73 involved constant illumination
with a given wavelength.
8079.34 Here, it is wavelength generating
patterns of illumination,
8084.93 light on, light off, light on, light off,
8086.62 at a particular frequency.
8088.53 So what they found, for instance,
8089.78 using this pattern of stimulation,
8091.25 and by the way, the
stimulation was called genus,
8093.69 gamma entrainment using
sensory stimulation,
8096.18 so G-E-N-U-S,
8097.32 gamma entrainment using
sensory stimulation,
8100.03 had a number of really
interesting effects.
8101.61 First of all, it reduced
so-called amyloid plaques
8104.95 and phosphorylated tau.
8106.71 Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau
8108.4 are associated with Alzheimer's
8109.81 and normal age related cognitive decline.
8112.89 So this is incredible, right?
8115.96 A pattern of flashing
light delivered to the eyes
8119.28 creates a pattern of neuronal firing,
8121.4 not just in the visual areas of the brain,
8123.16 but in other areas of the brain as well,
8125.64 that in turn trigger molecular pathways
8128.75 that reduce some of the markers
8132.05 and the cause age-related
cognitive decline in Alzheimer's.
8135.58 And in parallel to that,
they observed an upregulation
8139.16 of some of the biological pathways
8140.939 that lead to enhancement
of neuronal function,
8143.53 maintenance of synapses,
8144.66 which are the connections between neurons,
8146.53 and so on, and so on.
8148.35 They have discovered and
list out a huge number
8150.85 of these biological effects,
8152.45 both the reduction in
bad things, so to speak,
8155.3 and the improvement in
good biological pathways.
8159.12 And I find these studies so exciting
8162.1 because, first of all,
they're non-invasive, right?
8165.6 There's no drilling through the skull.
8167.56 They are very tractable
in the experimental sense,
8171.79 meaning that you can imagine
8174.06 that if 40 hertz stimulation turns out
8175.97 to be the very best stimulation protocol
8177.86 to induce these gamma
oscillations, well, great,
8180.4 but because it's non-invasive,
8182.33 it's fairly easy to explore
50 hertz stimulation,
8185.14 100 hertz stimulation,
20 hertz stimulation,
8187.54 and to do that with different
wavelengths of light.
8190.247 And so that's what's happening now.
8191.83 The Tsai lab and other
labs are really starting
8193.64 to explore the full range of variables
8196.7 that can impact oscillations
within the brain
8199.71 and their downstream consequences.
8201.49 So again, this is phototherapy,
8203.64 but phototherapy of a very different sort
8205.51 that we've been talking
about up until now.
8207.89 It's phototherapy designed
to trigger activation
8210.96 of biological pathways far
away from the very tissue
8214.25 that's being illuminated.
8215.26 And it calls to mind the
same sorts of mechanisms
8217.017 that we were talking about earlier,
8218.36 where illumination of
the skin with UVB light
8220.87 is setting off an enormous
number of different cascades
8223.15 in different organs and tissues,
8224.55 including the spleen, the
testes, the ovaries, and so on.
8228.17 So again, light has
these powerful effects,
8231.79 both locally on the cells that
the light is delivered to,
8235.09 but also systemically
in terms of the cells
8238.47 that are changing their
electrical and chemical outputs,
8241.7 are modifying lots and lots
of biological programs.
8244.75 Is there an actionable tool
related to these studies yet?
8247.97 Well, that sort of depends
on how adventurous you are.
8250.29 Right now, these studies
are being explored
8252.9 in the context of clinical trials,
8254.53 in people with Alzheimer's, dementia,
8256.35 and other forms of neurodegeneration.
8260.33 Is it dangerous to look at
a 40-hertz flickering light?
8264.12 Well, in general, the
answer is going to be no.
8266.86 However, if you're prone
to epilepsy, for instance,
8270.02 staring at a flickering light
8271.19 of a given continuous frequency
can induce seizure, right?
8275.21 That might surprise some of you,
8276.59 but it shouldn't, because
as this study illustrates
8280.08 and as anyone who's ever been out at night
8282.62 to a club or something illustrates,
8285.69 when you look at a strobe
light, for instance,
8287.83 your whole world of
visual perception changes,
8289.96 but actually, the rhythm at
which you perceive music,
8293.23 at which you perceive conversation,
8294.47 at which you perceive
the movement of your body
8296.24 actually changes according to the patterns
8298.74 of visual flicker,
8299.75 in most cases, strobe,
8301.21 if we're using the sort
of club dancing example.
8304.84 Your brain is in training
to its outside environment.
8308.13 So given the power of flickering lights
8310.86 to entrain brain rhythms,
8313.14 I think at this stage, it's
probably too preliminary
8316.54 to really suggest a specific protocol,
8318.8 but I would definitely keep an eye out
8321.45 for these sorts of studies.
8323.75 They are coming out all the time.
8325.32 And I think in a very short period,
8327.96 we are going to see specific protocols
8330.45 that one could use even at home,
8333.06 and of course, these are
non-invasive protocols,
8334.93 in order to place the brain
into a particular state,
8338.72 not just for sake of
offsetting neurodegeneration,
8341.58 but also for enhancing focus,
8343.93 for enhancing the transition into sleep,
8345.95 and other brain states as well.
8347.66 Today, I covered what I would
say is a lot of information.
8351.28 My goal was to give you an understanding
8353.04 of how light can be used
to change the activities
8356.72 of cells, organelles within
those cells, entire organs,
8361.45 and how that can happen
locally and systemically.
8365.93 We talked about the power of
light to impact our biology
8368.55 at the endocrine level, neuronal level,
8370.4 immune level, mood, et cetera,
8373.51 through both illumination
of the eyes and the skin
8376.68 and other tissues as well.
8378.73 I realize that even though
this was a lot of information,
8382.39 there are many aspects of
phototherapy that I did not cover.
8386.42 I know there's a lot of
interest nowadays, for instance,
8388.54 in the use of red light and
other wavelength light therapies
8392.19 for ovarian health and testicular health.
8395.46 In fact, I get a lot of questions such as,
8399.14 can red light be used to
improve testosterone output?
8402.23 And if so, is that best accomplished
8404.46 by shining red light on the skin
8406.76 or directly on the
gonads, on the testicles?
8409.54 I'm going to cover those
data at a future time.
8413.5 Right now, the studies that
have been done in rodents,
8416.26 I don't think are easily
enough translated to humans.
8419.2 And the studies that are
happening in humans now
8421.5 are exciting in the sense that
they hold a lot of potential,
8424.56 but the data aren't clear yet.
8427.58 However, the data using UVB
on the skin of men and women
8433.01 in order to increase hormone,
8435.27 in particular testosterone
and estrogen output,
8437.26 those data, I think, are very exciting
8439.42 and very actionable when we
talked about those earlier.
8442.03 So if you want more information
8443.91 on how phototherapy can be used,
8445.65 certainly we will do another
episode on phototherapy
8448.83 in these other contexts.

8497.1 During today's podcast,
8498.24 we didn't really talk about supplements,
8499.65 but we do talk about supplements
and their various uses
8502.58 in many other episodes of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.
8505.53 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
8507.94 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them.
8510.37 For that reason, we've
partnered with Thorne,
8512.7 T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne supplements
8515.14 are the very highest
quality and stringency.
8517.91 If you'd like to see the
Thorne supplements that I take,
8520.18 you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
8524.15 And there you can get 20%
off any of the supplements
8526.79 that I take.
8527.623 And if you happen to navigate
deeper into the Thorne site,
8530.72 through that portal,
thorne.com/u/huberman,
8533.69 you can also get 20% off
any of the other supplements
8536.43 that Thorne makes.

8541.243 It's hubermanlab on Instagram.
8542.57 It's also hubermanlab on Twitter.
8544.36 And at both places, I provide science
8547.23 and science-based tools,
8548.23 some of which overlap with
the content of this podcast,
8550.81 much of which is unique from
the content of this podcast.
8553.63 If you're not already
subscribing to our newsletter,
8555.76 you might consider doing so.
8557.22 It's the so-called Neural
Network Newsletter.
8559.29 You can find it at hubermanlab.com.
8560.95 Just go into the menu, look
up Neural Network Newsletter.
8563.9 You provide email. It is zero cost.
8566.06 We provide summaries of podcasts,
8568.17 summaries of actionable

8578.35 I'm also pleased to announce
8579.41 that we have some live events coming up.
8581.28 So I will be giving a lecture
8582.81 called the Brain Body Contract,
8584.3 where I'll talk about science
and science-based tools,
8586.46 some of which overlap with the content
8588.1 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
8589.27 much of which is unique
8590.35 and has never been
presented publicly before.
8592.99 The first one is going
to be May 17th, 2022
8596.11 in Seattle, Washington.
8597.33 The second one is going to be
May 18th in Portland, Oregon.
8601.5 To access tickets, you can go
8602.93 to the link at hubermanlab.com/tour.
8606.41 So thank you once again
for joining me today
8608.48 for this deep dive discussion
into phototherapies,
8611.7 meaning the power of light
8612.84 to modulate our biology and health.
8614.98 And as always, thank you for
your interest in science.
