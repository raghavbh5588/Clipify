0.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the,"Huberman Lab podcast,"
2.25,where we discuss science
and,science-based tools
4.68,for everyday life.
5.43,[MUSIC PLAYING]
9.355,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
and,I'm a professor
11.11,of neurobiology
and,ophthalmology
13.39,at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.07,Today my guest is
Dr.,Sam Harris.
17.65,Dr. Sam Harris did his
undergraduate,training
20.02,in philosophy at
Stanford,University
22.69,and then went on to do his
doctorate,in neuroscience
25.03,at the University of
California,at Los Angeles.
27.77,He is well known
as,an author who
29.47,has written about
everything,from meditation
31.96,"to consciousness, free will."
33.91,And he holds many
strong,political views
36.07,that he's voiced on social
media,and in the content
38.56,of various books as they relate
to,philosophy and neuroscience.
42.28,During today's
"episode,",I mainly talk
44.53,to Dr. Harris about his
views,and practices related
47.44,"to meditation,"
"consciousness,",and free will.
50.77,"In fact, he made"
several,important points
52.96,about what a proper meditation
practice,can accomplish.
55.93,"Prior to this episode, I"
thought,that meditation
58.72,was about deliberately changing
one's,conscious experience
61.81,in order to achieve
things,such as deeper
64.209,"relaxation, a heightened"
sense,of focus or ability
67.15,"to focus generally,"
elevated,"memory, and so on."
70.75,What Sam taught me and what
you'll,soon learn as well
73.27,is that while
meditation,does indeed
75.28,hold all of those
valuable,"benefits,"
77.53,the main value of a
meditation,"practice,"
79.81,or perhaps the greater value
of,"a meditation practice,"
82.99,is that it doesn't
just,allow one
85.72,to change their
conscious,"experience,"
87.7,but it actually can
allow,a human being
90.19,to view consciousness itself.
92.08,That is to understand what the
process,of consciousness is.
95.89,"And in doing so, to"
profoundly,shift the way
98.74,that one engages with the
world,and with oneself
101.2,"in all practices, all"
"environments,","and at all times,"
105.11,both in sleep and
in,waking states.
107.41,And in that way
making,meditation
109.3,perhaps the most potent
and,important portal
112.93,by which one can access novel
ways,of thinking and being
116.89,and viewing one's
life,experience.
118.79,We also discussed the so-called
mind-body,problem and issues
122.11,of duality and free will.
124.03,Concepts from philosophy and
neuroscience,"that, fortunately,"
126.88,thanks to valuable experiments
and,deep thinking on the part
131.11,of people like Dr.
Sam,"Harris and others,"
133.84,is now leading people to
understand,really what free
137.11,will is and isn't.
138.7,Where the locus of free will
likely,"sits in the brain,"
141.73,if it indeed resides
in,the brain at all.
144.32,And what it means to
be,a conscious being
147.16,and how we can modify our
conscious,states in ways that
149.71,allow us to be more functional.
151.34,"We also discuss perception,"
both,visual perception auditory
154.24,"perception, and especially"
interesting,"to me,"
157.03,"and I think as well, hopefully"
to,"you, time perception,"
160.84,which we know is very
elastic,in the brain.
164.08,The literal frame
rate,by which we
166.33,process our conscious experience
can,expand and contract
169.84,dramatically depending
on,our state of mind
172.75,and how conscious we are
about,our state of mind.
175.42,So we went deep into
that,topic as well.
177.95,Today's discussion was indeed
an,intellectual deep dive
180.97,into all the topics that I
mentioned,"a few moments ago,"
183.74,but it also included
many,practical tools.
186.07,"In fact, I pushed"
Sam,to share with us
188.71,what his specific practices
are,and how we can all
192.01,arrive at a clearer and better
understanding,of a meditation
195.28,practice that we can
each,and all apply.
197.5,So that we can derive these
incredible,"benefits, not just"
200.53,the ones related to stress
and,"focus and enhanced memory,"
203.44,but the ones that relate
to,our consciousness.
206.32,That is to our deeper sense
of,self and to others.
209.23,Several times during
today's,"episode,"
210.85,I mentioned the Waing Up app.
212.41,The Waking Up app was
developed,"by Sam Harris,"
214.72,but I want to emphasize that my
mention,of the app is in no way
218.14,a paid promotional.
219.22,Rather the Waking Up
app,is one that I've
221.05,used for some period of time
now,"and find very, very useful."
224.525,I have family members
that,also use it.
226.15,Other staff members here
at,the Huberman Lab podcast
228.43,use it because we find it
to,be such a powerful tool.
231.52,Sam has generously offered
Huberman,Lab podcast listeners
234.4,a 30-day completely free
trial,of the Waking Up app.
237.542,If any of you want to
try,"it, you can simply go"
239.5,to wakingup.com/huberman to
get,that 30-day free trial.
243.252,During today's
"discussion,",we didn't just
244.96,talk about meditation
consciousness,and free will.
247.81,We also talked
about,psychedelics.
249.34,Both their therapeutic
applications,for the treatment
251.65,of things like
depression,"and PTSD,"
254.06,but also the use
of,psychedelics.
255.85,And we discussed Sam's
experiences,with psychedelics
258.519,as they relate to expanding
one's,consciousness.
261.1,I also asked Sam about
his,views and practices
263.74,related to social media.
265.39,Prompted in no small part by
his,recent voluntary decision
269.11,to close down his
Twitter,account.
271.06,So we talked about his
rationale,"for doing that,"
273.58,how he feels about doing that.
275.44,And I think you'll find that
to,be very interesting as well.
277.94,"Before we begin, I'd"
like,to emphasize
279.612,that this podcast is separate
from,my teaching and research
282.07,roles at Stanford.
283.12,"It is, however, part of my"
desire,and effort to bring
285.43,zero-cost-to-consumer
information,about science
287.65,and science-related tools
to,the general public.
290.23,In keeping with
that,"theme, I'd like"
291.73,to thank the sponsors
of,today's podcast.
294.26,Our first sponsor is Levels.
296.08,Levels is a program that lets
you,see how different foods
298.78,and behaviors affect
your,health by giving you
300.97,real-time feedback using a
continuous,glucose monitor.
304.51,One of the most
important,factors
305.92,in your immediate
and,long-term health
307.503,are your blood sugar levels.
308.692,And not just your overall blood
sugar,levels but your blood
311.15,sugar levels throughout the day
in,response to different foods
313.733,"you eat, to fasting if you're"
into,"fasting, to exercise,"
317.16,and so forth.
318.14,I started using Levels
some,time ago in order
321.02,to figure out how different
foods,impact my blood sugar
323.54,"levels, and indeed, it"
does,that very well.
325.88,It allowed me to see
how,certain foods really
327.8,spike my blood sugar and
others,keep it more level.
330.44,"And in particular, how foods"
that,I eat after exercise
333.29,can help raise my blood
glucose,just enough but not so
335.9,much that then I get a crash
two,"or three hours later,"
338.25,which was what was happening
before,I started using Levels.
340.79,I've made certain
adjustments,to my diet.
342.53,I can now eat post-exercise
and,still have plenty of energy
345.62,throughout the day
without,any issues.
347.45,It also has helped me understand
how,different behaviors impact
350.48,my blood glucose levels.
351.68,If you're interested in learning
more,about Levels and trying
354.222,a continuous glucose
monitor,"yourself,"
356.0,go to levels.link/huberman.
358.49,Again that's levels.link
spelled,L-I-N-K /huberman.
362.6,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by WHOOP.
365.21,WHOOP is a fitness
wearable,device
366.95,that tracks your daily
activity,and sleep
369.05,but goes beyond activity
and,sleep tracking
371.36,to provide real-time feedback
on,how to adjust your training
374.42,and sleep schedules in order
to,feel and perform better.
377.57,"Six months ago, I started"
working,with WHOOP
379.52,as a member of their
scientific,advisory council
381.95,as a way to help WHOOP advance
their,mission of unlocking
384.77,human performance.
386.25,"And as a WHOOP user,"
I've,experienced
387.92,firsthand the health
benefits,of their technology.
390.98,"It's clear, based"
on,"quality research,"
392.84,that WHOOP can inform you
how,"well you're sleeping,"
395.18,how to change your
sleep,"habits, how"
396.68,to change your activity habits.
398.06,Even how to modify different
aspects,"of your nutrition,"
401.01,"exercise, sleep, and"
lifestyle,in order
403.46,to maximize your
mental,"health, physical"
405.32,"health, and performance."
406.32,So whether or not
you're,an athlete
407.39,or you're exercising
simply,"for health,"
409.28,WHOOP can really
help,you understand
411.2,how your body functions
under,different conditions
413.6,and how to really program
your,"schedule, nutrition"
415.97,"and exercise, and many"
other,factors of your life
418.73,in order to really optimize
your,"health and performance,"
421.32,including your cognition.
422.798,If you're interested
in,"trying WHOOP,"
424.34,you can go to join WHOOP
spelled,whoop.com/huberman.
429.11,That's join whoop.com/huberman
today,and get your first month
432.75,free.
433.25,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Eight Sleep.
436.01,Eight Sleep make smart mattress
covers,"with cooling, heating,"
438.71,and sleep-tracking capacity.
440.51,I've talked many times
before,on this podcast
442.58,about the fact that sleep
is,the fundamental layer
445.22,"of mental health, physical"
"health,",and performance.
447.45,Now one of the key things for
getting,a great night's sleep
449.908,every single night is to
optimize,the temperature
452.36,of your sleeping environment.
453.8,"Put simply, in order to fall"
asleep,"and stay deeply asleep,"
457.22,your body temperature needs to
drop,by about 1 to 3 degrees.
460.22,"And waking up, on"
the,"other hand,"
461.97,involves a heating of your
body,by about 1 to 3 degrees.
465.47,"With Eight sleep, you"
can,tune the temperature
468.35,of your mattress
cover,or mattress
470.36,to be cooler or hotter depending
on,whether or not you tend
473.48,to run too hot or too cold.
474.86,And you can even vary
it,across the night
476.63,so that you can access the best
deep,sleep early in the night.
479.51,"The so-called REM sleep,"
rapid,"eye movement sleep,"
481.64,that's more pronounced in
the,later half of the night.
483.89,And doing so really
get,your sleep
485.39,optimized not just
in,terms of duration
487.52,but in terms of quality and
the,overall architecture
490.04,of your sleep.
490.73,This has a profound influence
on,"your alertness, focus, mood,"
493.993,and many other important
factors,throughout the day.
496.16,If you'd like to

530.36,"And now, for my discussion"
with,Dr. Sam Harris.
533.6,Dr. Sam Harris.
534.65,SAM HARRIS: [LAUGHTER]
536.3,ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're
just,talking about this.
537.35,"SAM HARRIS: Yes, doctor."
537.605,ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
are,indeed a doctor.
538.91,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
539.743,SAM HARRIS: I cannot save
your,"life, but I am--"
542.34,I might save your non-existent
soul,if we talk long enough.
545.652,ANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHTER]
"Well,",neither of us
547.61,"are clinicians, but"
we,are both brain
550.61,explorers from the
different,perspectives.
553.712,Some overlapping.
554.42,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
555.29,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm
really,excited to have
556.64,this conversation.
557.6,I've been listening to
your,voice for many years
560.63,learning from you
for,many years.
562.35,And I'd be remiss
if,I didn't say
564.65,"that my father, who's"
also,"a scientist,"
567.44,is an enormous fan of
your,Waking Up app.
570.772,SAM HARRIS: Nice.
571.48,That's great.
571.61,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
has,spent a lot of time
573.83,over the last few years.
575.87,He's in his late 70s.
577.07,He's almost 80.
578.21,He's a theoretical
physicist,walking
580.31,to the park near his
apartment,and spending
582.47,time meditating with the app.
584.143,Or sometimes
separate,from the app
585.56,but using the same sorts
of,meditations in his head.
587.785,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
588.26,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So he kind
of,toggles back and forth.
590.51,And even-- I
shouldn't,say-- even
592.73,"but-- yes, even in"
his,"late 70s, has"
595.16,reported that it
has,significantly
597.68,shifted his awareness of self
and,his conscious experience
602.54,of things happening
in,and around him.
605.12,And he was somebody
"who,","I think,"
607.72,already saw himself as
a,pretty aware person.
612.472,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
613.18,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thinking about
quantum,mechanics and the rest.
616.72,So a thank you from
him,indirectly.
618.64,"SAM HARRIS: Oh, that's great."
619.848,ANDREW HUBERMAN: A thank
you,from me now directly.
622.63,And I really want to use that as
a,way to frame up what I think
625.63,is one of the more interesting
questions,in not just science
629.23,and philosophy and
psychology,"but all of life,"
631.94,which is what is this
thing,that we call a self?
635.62,"As far as I know, we have"
not,localized the region
638.92,in the brain that
can,entirely account
641.41,for our perception of self.
643.18,"There are areas, of course,"
that,"regulate proprioception,"
646.21,our awareness of where
our,limbs are in space.
648.8,Maybe even our awareness of
where,we are in physical space.
651.73,"There are such circuits,"
as,we both know.
653.62,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
654.328,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But when
we,"talk about sense of self,"
657.93,I have to remember this kind
of,neuroscience 101 thing
661.818,that we always say.
662.61,"When you teach memory, you"
say,"you wake up every morning,"
665.13,and you remember who you are.
666.48,You know who you are.
667.62,Most people do.
668.85,Even if they lack memory systems
in,the brain for whatever
671.58,"reason, pretty much everyone"
seems,to know who they are.
675.52,What are your thoughts on what
that,whole thing is about?
678.9,And do we come into the
world,feeling that way?
681.36,I would appreciate answers from
the,perspective of any field--
685.922,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
686.63,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --including
"neuroscience,",of course.
687.83,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
688.05,"Well, big question."
688.98,"I mean, the problem is we"
use,the term self in so
691.98,"many different ways, right."
693.36,And there's one sense
of,"that term, which"
698.4,is the target of
"meditation,",and it's
700.59,the target of deconstruction
by,"the practice and by,"
703.65,"as you said, any"
surrounding,philosophy.
705.42,"So you'll hear, and"
you'll,"hear it from me,"
708.03,that this self is
an,"illusion, right."
711.48,And that there's a
psychological,freedom that
714.84,can be experienced on the
other,side of discovering
717.0,it to be an illusion.
719.683,And some people don't
like,that framing.
721.35,Some people would insist that
it's,"not so much an illusion,"
724.47,"but it's a construct, and"
it's,"not what it seems, right."
729.99,But it's not that every use of
the,term self is illegitimate.
734.43,And there are certain types of
selves,that are not illusory.
737.58,"I mean, I'm not saying"
that,people are illusions.
740.73,I'm not saying that you
can't,talk about yourself
746.4,as distinct-- yourself
as,the whole person
748.8,and with as
psychological,continuity
751.53,with your past experience
as,being distinct
755.01,from the person and
psychological,continuity
757.74,"of some other person, right."
758.907,I mean-- because
"obviously,",we have
760.365,to be able to
conserve,those data.
762.09,It's not fundamentally
mysterious,
764.04,that you're going
to,wake up tomorrow
765.63,morning still being
psychologically,continuous
768.09,with your past and
not,"my past, right."
770.22,"And if we swapped lives, that"
would,demand some explanation.
776.92,So the illusorines
of,the self doesn't
779.46,cut against any of
those,obvious facts.
782.07,So the sense of self
that,is illusory.
786.21,"And again, we might want to"
talk,about self in other modes
788.85,because there's just
a,lot of interest
791.85,there psychologically and
ultimately,scientifically.
797.55,The thing that doesn't exist--
799.77,it certainly doesn't
exist,as it seems
801.51,and I would want to argue
that,it actually is just
803.61,"a proper illusion,"
is,this the sense
808.75,that there is a subject
interior,to experience
812.95,in addition to experience.
814.31,So most people feel
like,they're having
816.58,an experience of the world.
817.847,And they're having their--
an,experience of their bodies
820.18,in the world.
821.39,And in addition
to,"that, they feel"
823.75,that they are a subject internal
to,"the body, very likely"
828.37,in the head.
829.03,Most people feel like they're
behind,their face as a kind
832.42,of locus of awareness and
thought,and intention and that
837.4,every-- it's almost like
they're--,you're a passenger
840.01,inside your body.
841.24,You don't-- most people don't
feel,identical to their bodies.
844.03,And they can
imagine,this is sort
846.88,"of the origin, the"
psychological,"origin,"
849.07,"the folk psychological origin,"
of,a sense of that there
852.82,might be a soul that could
survive,the death of the body.
855.28,"I mean, most people are"
what,my friend Paul Blum
857.8,calls common sense do lists.
859.72,You-- you're just the
default,expectation
863.8,seems to be that whatever the
relationship,between the mind
867.43,"and the body, there"
is,this-- there's
870.58,some promise of
separability,"there, right."
873.29,That the-- and whenever you
really,push hard on the science
878.063,"side and say, well, no,"
"no,",the mind is really
879.98,just what the brain
is,"doing, that"
882.05,begins to feel more and more
counterintuitive,"to people,"
884.84,and there still seems
some,residual mystery
887.93,that at death maybe something
is,going to lift off the brain
892.06,"and go elsewhere, right."
893.06,So there's this sense of
dualism,that many people have.
896.33,"And obviously, that's supported"
by,many religious beliefs.
901.61,But this feeling it is a
very,peculiar starting point.
907.31,People feel that in a--
910.55,they don't feel identical
to,their experience.
912.948,"As a matter of experience,"
they,feel like they're
914.99,on the edge of experience.
917.6,Somehow appropriating
it,from the side.
920.67,You kind of on the
edge,of the world.
922.47,And the world is out there.
924.05,"Your body is, in"
some,"sense, an object"
927.17,in the world which is
different,from the world.
930.59,The boundary of your
skin,is still meaningful.
933.38,You can sort of loosely
control,your body.
936.65,"I mean, you can't control it--"
you,can control your gross
939.08,and subtle voluntary
motor,"movements,"
941.99,but you can't-- you're
not,controlling everything
945.428,your body is doing.
946.22,You're not controlling
your,heartbeat
947.762,and your hormonal
secretions,and all of that.
951.925,And so there's a
lot,that's going
953.3,on that is in the dark for you.
955.61,And then you give someone an
instruction,"to meditate, say."
961.53,"And you say, OK, well,"
let's,examine all of this
963.53,from the first person side.
964.655,Let's look for this
thing,you're calling I.
967.64,"And again, I is not"
identical,to the body.
970.85,People feel like their
hands,are out there.
972.642,And when-- if they're
going,"to meditate,"
974.308,they're going to close
their,eyes very likely.
976.225,And now they're going to
pay,attention to something.
978.391,They're going to pay attention
to,the breath or the sounds.
980.87,And it's from the point of view
of,being a locus of attention
985.01,that is now aiming attention
strategically,"at an object,"
988.17,"like the breath, that there's"
this,dualism that is set up.
992.15,"And ultimately, the ultimate"
promise,of meditation.
996.42,"I mean, there are"
really,two levels
998.64,at which you could be
interested,in meditation.
1002.21,One is very straightforward and
remedial,and non paradoxical
1006.89,and very well subscribed.
1008.42,And it's the usual set of claims
about,all the benefits you're
1012.262,going to get from meditation.
1013.47,So you're going to
lower,"your stress,"
1014.66,and you're going to
increase,"your focus,"
1016.46,and you're going to stave
off,"cortical thinning,"
1018.83,and there's all
kinds,of good things
1020.33,that science is saying
meditation,will give you.
1025.77,And none of that entails
really,drilling down
1028.77,on this paradoxical claim
that,the self is an illusion
1031.17,or anything else of that sort.
1034.0,But from my point of
"view,",the real purpose
1037.2,of meditation and
its,real promise
1038.819,is not in this long
list,of benefits.
1042.45,And I'm not discounting
any,of those
1044.67,though the science for many
of,them is quite provisional.
1049.29,It's in this deeper claim that
if,you look for this thing
1053.04,you're calling I. If
you,look for the sense
1055.11,that there's a thinker
in,addition to the mirror
1059.22,"rising of the next thought,"
"say,",you won't find that thing.
1063.34,"And you can-- what's more,"
you,cannot find it in a way
1067.81,that's conclusive and
that,"matters, right."
1070.99,And it has-- there's
a,host of benefits
1073.81,that follow from that
discovery,which are quite
1079.98,a bit deeper and more
interesting,than engaging
1082.62,meditation on the
side,of its benefits.
1084.27,"You know, de-stressing,"
increasing,"focus,"
1086.49,and all the rest.
1088.08,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a
number,of questions related--
1089.19,SAM HARRIS: Sure.
1089.4,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to
what,you just said.
1091.108,"And first of all, I agree that"
the,evidence that meditation
1095.19,"can improve focus,"
reduce,"stress, et cetera."
1097.08,It's there.
1097.71,It's not an enormous pile of
"evidence,",but it's growing.
1101.22,And--
1101.72,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1101.79,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I
think,that especially
1103.54,for some of the shorter
"meditations,",which
1105.36,I these days view more
as,perceptual exercises.
1109.5,I've talked about this
in,the podcast before.
1112.14,But for those who haven't heard
it,before about perception.
1114.88,You can have extra perception
extending,to things
1117.51,beyond the confines
of,your skin.
1118.92,"Interception, which"
"is,","I think, also"
1121.23,includes the surface of the
skin,but everything inward.
1124.26,And meditation through eyes
closed,typically involving
1128.82,some sort of attentional
"spotlighting,",something
1131.13,we'll get into more.
1133.08,Interior receptive versus
external,"receptive events,"
1135.37,"et cetera, including thoughts."
1137.16,And-- so I think of--
1139.47,at a basic level
meditation,as somewhat
1142.08,of a perceptual exercise.
1144.69,You can tell me where
you,"disagree there,"
1146.4,and I would expect and
hope,that you would.
1148.755,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1149.756,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I would
like,to just touch on this idea
1152.256,that you brought up because
it's,such an interesting one.
1154.631,Of this idea that our bodies
are,containers and that
1157.17,we somehow view
ourselves,as passengers
1160.02,within those containers.
1162.0,That's certainly
been,my experience.
1164.37,And the image that
I,have is of--
1167.68,"as you say, that is"
of,myself or of people
1170.34,out there that sit a few
centimeters,below the surface
1174.39,or that sit entirely
in,their head.
1176.46,"And, of course,"
the,brain and body
1178.59,are connected through
the,nervous system.
1180.36,I think sometimes
a,brain is used
1182.778,to replace a nervous
"system,",and that
1184.32,can get us into trouble
in,terms of coming up
1186.33,with real directions
and,definitions.
1188.49,But the point is that
there,is something special
1192.193,about the real
estate,in the head.
1193.61,I think for as much
as,"my laboratory,"
1195.68,and many other scientists
are,really interested
1198.08,in brain-body connections
through,the nervous system
1200.54,and other organ systems that
the,nervous system binds
1204.29,that if you cut
off,"all my limbs,"
1207.2,"I'm going to be different, but"
I'm,fundamentally still Andrew.
1210.14,SAM HARRIS: Right.
1210.89,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Whereas,if we were
1212.348,to lesion a couple of
square,millimeters out
1214.34,"of my parietal cortex,"
it's,an open question
1217.4,as to whether or not I would
still,seem as much like Andrew
1220.563,to other people and to myself--
1221.855,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1222.17,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --even.
1222.74,And so there is something
fundamentally,different
1224.782,about the real estate
in,the cranial vault.
1227.09,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1227.21,"I mean, we are--"
1227.45,ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can
even,"remove both of my eyes,"
1229.16,I'd still be Andrew.
1229.993,And those are two pieces of
my,central nervous system
1232.49,that are fundamental to my
daily,"life, but I'd still be me."
1237.29,Whereas-- and this
"doesn't,","I think,"
1239.78,just apply to memory systems.
1240.988,"I mean, I think"
there,are regions
1242.363,of the frontal cortex
"that,","when destroyed,"
1244.16,have been shown to modify
personality,and self-perception
1247.88,in dramatic ways.
1249.15,So it's a sort of obvious
point,"once it's made,"
1251.63,but I do think it's worth
highlighting,because there
1254.465,does seem to be something
special,about being
1256.34,in the head.
1256.88,The other thing is that
sitting,a few centimeters
1262.2,below the surface or
riding,in this container
1265.14,makes sense to me.
1266.4,Except I wonder if
you've,ever experienced
1270.18,a shift as I have when
something,very extreme happens.
1273.84,Let's use the negative
example,of all of a sudden
1277.2,you're in a fear state.
1278.4,"All of a sudden, it feels as"
if,your entire body is you
1282.03,or is me.
1283.53,And now I need to get this
thing--,the whole container
1286.68,and me to some place of
safety,in whatever form.
1291.49,"This is also true, I"
"think,",in ecstatic states--
1293.73,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1294.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --where
you,can feel really--
1294.84,"when people say embodied,"
I,wonder whether or not
1297.09,we normally oscillate below
the,surface of our body.
1299.445,"When I say oscillate,"
I,mean in neural terms.
1301.32,"I mean, maybe our"
sensory,experience
1303.18,is not truly at
the,bodily surface
1305.52,but sits below the
bodily,surface more
1307.847,at the level of organ
systems,and within our head.
1309.93,And then certain
things,that jolt us--
1312.3,our autonomic nervous system
into,heightened states
1315.24,bring us into states of--
1317.616,bring us closer to the
surface,and therefore include
1320.4,all of us.
1321.39,"Again, I don't want to take us"
down,a mechanistic description
1324.48,of something that doesn't exist.
1326.19,But does any of that
resonate,in terms
1328.8,of how you are thinking
about,or describing the self?
1331.08,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah."
1332.13,There's a lot there.
1333.69,"First, on the point of"
the,brain being the locus
1336.99,of what we are as minds.
1340.193,"Yeah, I mean, there"
are,people who
1341.61,will insist that sort of
the,whole nervous system
1345.21,has to be thought of as a--
1346.977,when you're talking
about,our emotional life
1348.81,and the insulas
connection,to the gut.
1355.38,And just the sense of self
extends,beyond the brain.
1360.39,But I totally take your
point,that a brain transplant
1364.23,is a coherent
"idea,",and you would
1366.33,expect to go with the brain
rather,than with the viscera.
1369.12,"And so, in that"
"sense,",we really are
1372.72,the old philosophical
thought,experiment
1375.09,of being a brain in a VAT.
1376.44,"I mean, we essentially"
are,already--
1377.94,"the VAT is our skull, and we're"
virtually,in that situation.
1383.003,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
A,horrible movie.
1384.42,I'm sorry I can't
help,but interrupt.
1385.485,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1385.65,ANDREW HUBERMAN: When
I,"was a teenager,"
1387.42,my sister and I used
to,go to the movies
1388.56,"every once in a while,"
and,we'd trade off
1390.09,who could pick the movie.
1391.26,And she took me to see once
the,movie Boxing Helena.
1394.537,SAM HARRIS: Oh yeah.
1395.37,ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
David,Lynch film--
1396.69,SAM HARRIS: Which I
never,saw that again.
1397.38,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--where,he amputates
1398.31,the limbs of a woman who he's
obsessed,by and keeps her.
1400.85,It's a really horrible--
1401.85,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1402.33,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --film.
1403.33,"And about 20 minutes into it,"
my,sister just turned to me
1405.84,"and said, I'm so sorry."
1407.402,And the question there
was,whether or not
1409.11,two siblings should actually
persist,in a movie like that.
1411.59,SAM HARRIS: Right.
1411.96,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we
decided,to persist in the movie
1413.46,so that we could
laugh,about it later.
1415.44,But it was rather disturbing.
1416.793,I don't recommend the movie.
1417.96,Nor do I recommend
seeing,it with a sibling.
1419.793,"But in that movie, the woman,"
he,takes her as a container
1424.14,and restricts her movement.
1425.61,Quite sadistic and
horrible,thing really.
1429.6,"David Lynch, interesting"
mind,perhaps.
1432.96,But the idea was to question
how,much of the person
1437.46,persists in the absence of their
ability,"to move, et cetera."
1440.13,Could there be love?
1441.03,Could there be these
other,affections?
1443.55,"Anyway, a rather"
extreme,example.
1445.26,But one that still haunts me.
1447.218,And I suppose I'm
thinking,about still now.
1449.01,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah."
1449.7,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
1450.617,"SAM HARRIS: Well, so just"
to,"follow that point,"
1454.5,there's a lot about us that we
don't,have access to unless we
1460.05,enact it physically.
1461.22,"Like if I ask you, do you"
still,know how to ride a bike?
1466.65,There's no place in
your,memory where
1468.78,you can inspect but just
sitting,in your chair
1472.32,that you've retained
the,knowledge of how
1474.63,to ride a bike.
1475.662,Procedural memory
is,different from
1477.12,semantic or episodic memory.
1478.35,"If I asked you, do"
you,know your address?
1482.4,"Yes, you can recall your"
address,just sitting there.
1485.73,But if you had had a micro
stroke,that neatly dissected
1488.79,out your ability to
ride,a bike and left
1491.49,everything else
"intact,",you might
1493.773,think you could ride a bike.
1494.94,"But suddenly, you"
stand,up next to one.
1496.963,And you have no idea
what,to do with it.
1498.63,And that would be
a,discovery that
1500.047,would only happen if
you,were motorically
1502.44,engaged with that object.
1506.01,And I'm sure we could
probably,come up
1507.99,with 100 things about us
that,really seem core to us
1511.53,and not separable from
our,personhood which
1518.39,seemed to only get
invoked,when we're
1521.78,"out they're moving in the world,"
and,"we have limbs, et cetera."
1529.53,"No, it's the seat"
of,"consciousness,"
1536.948,the right framework
to,talk about all
1538.49,"of this, from my"
point,"of view, is"
1539.42,consciousness and its contents.
1541.018,So we have consciousness.
1542.06,The fact that there's something
that,"is like to be us,"
1544.94,the fact that the world
and,our internal experience
1549.35,is illuminated.
1550.79,It has a qualitative character.
1554.277,"And then, there's"
the,question of what
1555.86,is that qualitative character?
1558.05,What kinds of information
do,we have access to?
1560.33,What does it feel like to be us?
1561.95,How do different states
of,arousal change that?
1565.88,So you talked about fear.
1566.96,"Yeah, fear can change"
a,lot of things.
1571.58,And various neurological
"deficits,",or you
1574.64,can add drugs to the mix.
1575.85,You add psychedelics
that,radically transform
1578.69,the contents of consciousness.
1580.31,From my point of
"view,",consciousness
1581.81,itself is simply the
"cognizance,","the awareness,"
1586.79,that is the flood lights
by,which any of that stuff
1591.14,appears.
1591.98,So consciousness doesn't change.
1596.33,But its contents change.
1598.01,And to come back to meditation
for,"a second, many people"
1602.45,think meditation
is,about changing
1604.61,the contents of consciousness.
1606.12,There are some contents you
want,to get rid of like anxiety.
1609.29,Other contents you
want,"to encourage,"
1611.57,"like calm, and unconditional"
"love,",or some other classically
1615.8,"pleasant, prosocial emotion."
1618.74,And that's all fine.
1619.88,That's all possible.
1621.23,But the real wisdom of
the,2000-year-old wisdom
1627.35,of meditation that really is the
chewy,center of the Tootsie Pop
1631.58,is a recognition of what
consciousness,itself is always
1636.08,already like regardless
of,the contents in it
1638.54,and the changes in contents.
1639.98,And this is why we
might,talk about this.
1643.01,But this is why they're
mutually,compatible.
1646.52,"Psychedelics and meditation,"
for,"me, are somewhat orthogonal."
1649.31,Because psychedelics is all
about,making wholesale changes
1652.94,to the contents
of,consciousness.
1654.32,And there's some wonderful
consequences,of doing that.
1658.07,There can be some harrowing
and,terrifying consequences
1660.677,of doing that.
1661.26,"But generally speaking,"
I,"think used wisely,"
1665.137,they can be incredibly valuable.
1666.47,And the therapeutic
potential,there is enormous.
1670.16,But the crucial disjunction
here,is that there really
1675.56,is something to recognize about
ordinary,"waking consciousness,"
1678.63,the consciousness that's
compatible,with my driving
1681.08,a car to get here on time.
1683.15,You don't have to have the
pyrotechnics,of being on LSD
1688.58,to see to transcend the
central,illusion that I'm
1696.24,saying is the thing
to,"be transcended,"
1698.19,which is the sense that there
is,a duality between subject
1701.52,and object in every
moment,of experience.
1704.94,And to take it back to something
you,said about just all
1707.58,of our different modes
in,"ordinary life,"
1710.13,the interesting thing is I
think,people are constantly
1712.5,losing their sense of self.
1714.6,And they're not aware of it.
1715.92,And there's probably an
analogy,to the visual system
1721.59,"here, which is to visual"
"saccade,",which perhaps you've
1726.6,spoken about at some
point,on your podcast.
1728.55,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not enough.
1729.43,So please.
1729.98,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
1730.71,So what happens every
time,"we move our eyes,"
1733.35,this is called a saccade.
1734.73,And we do that about three times
a,second or so just normally.
1739.89,There is the region
of,motor cortex
1743.37,that affects that
movement,sends what's
1746.55,called an efferent copy of
that,"motor movement, which"
1752.43,is used as information
that,propagates back
1755.04,"to visual cortex, that"
suppresses,the data of vision
1759.39,while the eyes are moving.
1760.92,Because otherwise if
you,"weren't doing that,"
1763.223,every time you
moved,"your eyes, it"
1764.64,would seem like the visual scene
itself,was lurching around.
1767.58,And people can experience
this,for themselves
1769.83,if they just touch one of
their,"eyeballs on the side,"
1773.22,"not all that hard,"
and,kind of jiggle it.
1775.505,"And then, you can"
roll,it around.
1776.88,You can jiggle it
from,side to side.
1778.38,You can see a movement
of,the eyeball that's
1783.39,not governed by your
oculomotor,system
1786.06,delivers a jiggling
of,the world.
1787.98,Because your brain is
not,anticipating it
1790.163,in the same way.
1790.83,And you're not producing
that,same predictive copy
1796.5,of the movement.
1797.86,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
a,little bit like--
1800.447,we have some action sports
filmmakers,on our staff
1802.53,"here that the gimbal,"
that,"holds an iPhone,"
1805.66,like you see the
kids,on surfboards
1807.183,or skateboards or something.
1808.35,They're going to hold a
phone,while moving around
1810.392,"or the people, the"
vloggers--,does anyone
1812.49,even still use that for phrase?
1813.85,SAM HARRIS: I don't know.
1814.892,I guess.
1816.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Moving around
and,"it's image stabilization,"
1818.73,"essentially, that keeps"
the,camera steady.
1821.97,And these are more than
"cameras,","of course,"
1824.647,"for those listening,"
point,at my eyes.
1826.23,But they do far more than
just,what a camera would do.
1828.48,But this internal system
of,"image stabilization, I"
1832.5,can see perhaps where
you're,"going with this,"
1835.29,that it allows us to remain in
a,"self-referencing scheme, as"
1842.12,opposed to paying attention
to,just how confusing it
1845.84,is to track the visual
world,at some level.
1847.703,"SAM HARRIS: Well, actually"
where,"I'm going is,"
1849.62,that people are having this
suppression,of vision three
1854.75,times a second on average.
1856.58,And they're not experiencing it.
1858.83,You're effectively going blind.
1862.67,And you're not noticing it.
1865.897,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's very fast.
1867.23,"SAM HARRIS: Yes, it's very fast."
1868.563,Now there's an analogous
"suppression,","I would say,"
1875.45,of the sense of self that
occurs,every time attention gets
1880.96,absorbed significantly
in,its object.
1884.53,We even have this concept of
losing,yourself in your work.
1889.81,Classic flow experiences
have,this quality.
1893.86,And this tends to be why
they're,so rewarding.
1898.09,If you're in some athletic
activity,"or an aesthetic one,"
1905.29,or you could be having
"sex,",or whatever
1907.15,"it is, some peak experience,"
its,peakness usually
1911.5,entails there being
some,brief period
1915.01,where there was no distance
between,you and the experience.
1919.462,"For that moment,"
you,were no longer
1920.92,looking over your own shoulder
or,anticipating the next moment
1925.09,"or trying to get somewhere,"
where,"you weren't,"
1927.79,or micromanaging errors.
1932.44,There's just the flow of unity
with,whatever the experience
1938.29,"is, a surfer on the wave."
1941.89,And we love those experiences.
1944.78,And then we are continually
abstracted,away from them
1950.77,by our thinking about them.
1952.477,"We're thinking, oh my"
"god,","that was so good,"
1954.31,or how do I get back to that?
1955.518,Or you're looking at a sunset.
1957.22,It's the most beautiful
sunset,you've ever seen.
1959.65,And then you're continually
interrupting,the experience
1963.64,of merely seeing it with
a,commentary about how
1967.21,amazing this is.
1968.05,"And I wonder, what real"
estate,prices are here?
1970.54,"I mean, is it possible"
that,I could move here.
1972.52,And your mind is just
continually,narrating
1976.96,a conversation you're having
with,"yourself, however"
1979.72,paradoxically.
1980.41,"I mean, you're telling"
yourself,things
1982.93,that you already know as
though,there are two of you
1986.5,rather often.
1988.96,I'm looking for--
which,is the water.
1991.867,"And it's, oh, there it is."
1992.95,But I'm the one seeing it.
1995.5,"Who am I saying,"
"oh,",there it is to.
1998.26,Is there someone else
who,needs to be informed
2000.99,about the thing I already saw.
2003.66,So there's something about
our,internal dialogue
2006.39,that is paradoxical.
2009.78,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there
any,neurologic condition
2014.136,call it soulectomy or anything
like,that where somehow people
2017.85,feel more unified with the
self,"on a continual basis,"
2021.9,the observer and
the,actor within?
2026.22,State more as a
complete,sentence.
2029.25,Is there any known
neurological,syndrome--
2032.697,"makes it sound like a bad thing,"
but,it could be a good thing.
2035.28,--whereby people
feel,that the actor
2038.25,and the observer within them
are,unified continually?
2041.46,SAM HARRIS: There's
not,a pathological one.
2043.38,Some the work on the
default-mode,network
2045.9,suggests that that's at
least,part of the story.
2049.03,So the default-mode
"network,",which
2052.98,has been talked about a
lot,of late because it
2055.71,has come up both in the
meditation,literature
2058.8,and in the psychedelic
literature.,
2061.08,But its original discovery
was,that-- and the reason
2065.4,why I was called the
default,mode was is
2067.199,that in virtually every
neuroimaging,experiment ever
2070.05,"run, they found that between"
"tasks,",when the brain was just
2074.37,"in its default state, these"
midline,structures would
2078.81,increase their activity.
2080.76,And then they would
reliably,diminish
2083.55,whenever the person in
the,scanner was on task.
2087.96,"And usually, that meant"
some,outward looking
2092.31,visual discrimination task.
2093.81,But it could be visual.
2095.73,It could be semantic.
2096.84,But it tends to be
their,eyes are open.
2098.732,And they're paying
attention,to something
2100.44,that's being broadcast to
them,"through monitor goggles,"
2104.588,or they're looking at a mirror
that's,showing them a computer
2107.13,monitor.
2108.97,But so the general
insight,"was, there"
2112.17,are these midline
structures,in the brain that
2114.12,seem to be increasing
their,activity when
2118.38,the brain is idling
between,"tasks, waiting"
2121.11,for something to happen.
2122.8,And then further
experiments,found
2125.76,tasks that actually upregulated
activity,there beyond baseline.
2131.73,And those tasks seem
to,be self referential.
2135.87,So that when you ask people--
2137.38,you give them a list of words.
2138.63,"And you say, well, do any"
of,these apply to you?
2143.25,Or you ask people
to,think about--
2148.02,"Actually, one experiment I did."
2149.43,When you're challenging
people's,"beliefs, when you're"
2153.09,challenging beliefs
that,have more
2155.37,"of a personal significance, like"
political,"or religious beliefs,"
2158.64,you get an upregulation
in,these regions
2160.65,as opposed to just generic
beliefs,about you're
2163.92,in Los Angeles.
2164.92,This is a table.
2165.69,That is something to which
people,are not holding fast
2169.92,as a matter of identity.
2173.65,"So anyway, both meditation"
and,psychedelics
2177.9,seem to suppress activity
in,"these regions, which"
2182.04,we know are associated with
both,"self-talk, mind-wandering,"
2188.01,and explicit acts of
self,representation.
2189.985,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Could,we say that they
2191.61,are somewhat
autobiographical,because they
2193.65,access memory systems?
2195.18,And in the way you're
describing,"them,"
2197.803,and in the way that
a,"colleague of mine,"
2199.47,who's been a guest
on,this podcast--
2200.8,I don't know if you've
interacted,with him before.
2202.14,But I think you'd very much
enjoy,whatever interaction you
2205.11,would have. --is David Spiegel.
2206.85,He's our associate
chair,of psychiatry.
2208.8,He and his father
actually--,his father
2210.66,then he founded hypnosis as
a,valid clinical practice
2215.19,in psychiatry.
2215.85,"And hypnosis, which is obviously"
a,heightened sense of attention
2218.97,"with deep relaxation, is"
known,to dramatically suppress
2222.3,the default-mode network.
2224.337,He talks about this a lot.
2225.42,And I always wonder as
we,take down activity
2230.55,within the default-mode
"network,",what what surfaces
2236.46,"in its place, does that"
somehow,reflect that the two
2240.45,are normally in a push-pull?
2242.1,Because that's not
necessarily,the case.
2244.14,"When I fall asleep,"
I,can hallucinate.
2245.91,But that doesn't mean
that,"during the day,"
2247.83,the fact that I'm
looking,at objects
2249.63,is what's preventing
me,from hallucinating.
2251.79,"If I close my eyes,"
I,can get imagery.
2253.65,But there's this
different,"illusion,"
2256.62,the illusion of antagonistic
circuitry,sometimes.
2259.722,I don't want to
take,"us off course,"
2261.18,but the default-mode network
seems,"to ""want to be there,"""
2265.715,"quote, unquote."
2266.34,It seems to be fighting
for,"our attention,"
2270.03,unless we give ourselves
a,"visual target,"
2271.77,"or an auditory target, or"
some,salient experience
2274.35,"of some kind, it sounds like."
2275.82,"And then, I'm surprised to"
hear,that meditation reduces
2280.41,activity in the default-mode
network,at some level
2282.78,because meditation
to,me oftentimes
2286.05,involves paying attention
to,some perceptual target.
2290.55,Maybe you could
eventually,explain
2292.98,as to how it might do
that,or why it might.
2295.757,SAM HARRIS: And I don't
think,it's the whole story
2297.84,"because, obviously,"
outward-going,attention is
2301.66,not--
2305.08,even if you're having
the,kind of egoic
2307.65,"saccade that I'm talking about,"
where,you're actually not
2310.78,clearly aware of yourself.
2312.58,You're not clearly
defining,yourself
2314.44,as separate from experience for
the,"moment of paying attention,"
2319.21,so you are sort of losing
yourself,in your work.
2321.25,That's not the same
thing,as having
2322.93,the clear meditative insight of
selflessness,that I'm claiming
2326.5,is the goal of meditation.
2329.41,But to wind back to the
original,"point I was making,"
2333.28,and the reason why I drew the
analogy,"to visual saccades,"
2337.3,I do think there's a continuous
interruption,in our sense
2341.23,of self that goes unrecognized.
2347.19,But the conscious acquisition
of,the understanding
2353.35,that the self is an illusion
is,a different experience
2356.94,because you're then
focusing,on this absence.
2361.2,"Actually, there's"
another,analogy
2363.21,to the visual system
that,"applies here,"
2366.61,which is to the optic
blind,"spot, which"
2371.07,is a good analogy for
me,because it cuts
2373.08,through a bunch of
false,assumptions
2374.97,as to where you
would,look for this
2377.7,or how this relates to
ordinary,experience.
2381.0,So as many people know
that,in both eyes we have
2384.96,what's called the
blind,"spot, which"
2386.94,is a consequence of the
optic,nerve transiting
2390.21,"through the retina,"
unlike,cephalopods.
2393.93,I think cephalopods
have,"their optic nerve,"
2397.95,as an omniscient being
would,"have engineered it,"
2402.42,connecting the
retina,from the back.
2404.52,"And therefore, there"
is,no area of blindness
2408.083,associated with its transit
back,through the retina.
2410.25,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But our
receptors,are one the outside.
2411.99,SAM HARRIS: Exactly.
2412.77,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Humans,",for whatever
2414.312,"reason, put photoreceptors--"
"well,",I always
2416.19,say I wasn't consulted
on,the design phase.
2418.08,"Something put photoreceptors,"
combination,"of things,"
2421.92,put photoreceptors in the back.
2423.27,And so you actually have to
send,the highway of information
2426.3,through the pixel
center,of the eye.
2430.45,Cephalopods and
"drosophila,",basically
2435.06,"invertebrates, the design"
is,more at its face logical.
2440.4,"Mammals, very illogical"
"design,",at least as far
2443.97,as our judgments go.
2445.44,SAM HARRIS: But it
gives,me a good analogy.
2447.25,So I'll take it.
2448.462,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to,take a brief break
2450.42,and acknowledge our
"sponsor,",Athletic Greens.
2453.09,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
vitamin-mineral,probiotic drink
2456.6,that also contains digestive
enzymes,and adaptogens.
2459.69,I started taking Athletic
Greens,way back in 2012.
2462.87,So that's 10 years
now,of taking Athletic
2464.85,Greens every single day.
2466.21,So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,this podcast.
2468.51,The reason I started
taking,"Athletic Greens,"
2470.4,and the reason I still
take,"Athletic Greens,"
2472.41,is that it covers all of my
foundational,nutritional needs.
2475.475,So whether or not
I'm,eating well
2476.85,"or enough or not, I'm sure that"
I'm,covering all of my needs
2479.88,"for vitamins,"
"minerals,","probiotics,"
2481.8,adaptogens to combat stress.
2483.72,And the digestive enzymes
really,help my digestion.
2486.42,I just feel much better when
I'm,drinking Athletic Greens.
2488.928,If you'd like to
try,"Athletic Greens,"
2490.47,you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman.,
2493.26,And for the month
of,"January, they"
2494.873,have a special
offer,where they'll
2496.29,give you 10 free travel
"packs,",plus a year
2498.96,"supply of vitamin D3, K2."
2500.91,Vitamin D3 and K2 are
vital,"for immune function,"
2504.06,"metabolic function,"
hormone,"health,"
2505.71,but also calcium regulation
and,heart health.
2508.2,"Again, that's"
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2511.17,to claim their special offer in
the,month of January of 10 free
2514.2,"travel packs, plus a year"
supply,of vitamin D3 and K2.
2517.362,SAM HARRIS: So in
any,"case, we have"
2518.82,"this blind spot, which I"
think,most people learn
2523.41,this in school.
2524.58,"Although, my daughters had not"
been,taught this in school.
2526.997,I just showed them this for
the,first time a month ago.
2529.66,And they were
briefly,fascinated.
2531.48,And then they went to
return,to their screen time.
2534.0,"But anyway, you can"
take,a piece of paper.
2536.58,And you make two marks on it.
2538.17,And then you cover one eye.
2539.7,And you fixate on one mark.
2543.162,"I mean, you can"
look,this up online
2544.62,if you need details
about,how to do this.
2546.93,And while staring at
one,"fixation point,"
2550.38,you move the paper
back,and forth.
2552.312,And you can get it
to,a place where
2553.77,the other mark disappears.
2556.11,And you can run this
experiment,long enough
2558.51,to satisfy yourself
that,there is
2560.4,in fact a blind spot in
your,"visual field, which"
2562.68,with one eye closed you
don't,normally notice.
2566.7,The reason why you
have,to cover one eye
2568.56,is because each eye
compensates,for the blind spot
2571.05,of the other.
2572.97,Which is to say that
if,you close one eye
2574.95,"and survey the visual scene,"
something,"really is missing,"
2578.455,whatever you're looking at.
2579.58,If you're looking at
a,"crowd of people,"
2581.205,somebody is missing a head
and,you're not noticing it.
2583.68,And it's not easy to notice
because,the brain doesn't
2589.68,tend to vividly represent
the,absence of information.
2594.76,"I mean, it's just part of the"
game,that's not being rendered.
2597.93,It's not showing up as a
break,in the visual field.
2602.32,It's just not there.
2603.99,"And I mean, people have"
argued,that there's
2607.02,a filling-in phenomenon
that,"happens,"
2609.57,but I think that can be
misunderstood,or exaggerated.
2612.947,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But the
eye,"movements themselves,"
2615.03,that you described before--
2616.77,"I guess, I should say"
that,the saccade analogy
2620.37,about transiently and
repetitively,erasing the self
2624.78,"works perfectly here because,"
"indeed,","microsaccades,"
2627.57,"little smaller saccades, occur"
all,the time also prevent
2629.94,our eyes from fixating
in,one location
2632.017,long enough to observe
our,"blind spot,"
2633.6,even if one eye is closed.
2635.55,So if the experiment's done with
paralytics,to essentially lock
2639.36,"eyes at one location, basically,"
things,start disappearing.
2642.3,SAM HARRIS: It just fades away.
2642.81,ANDREW HUBERMAN: We
all,love to think
2643.38,"that we start hallucinating, but"
"actually,",we start going blind.
2646.26,And those experiments
have,been done on humans.
2648.6,I hear they're quite terrifying.
2650.832,"SAM HARRIS: I mean, you can"
do,that for yourself too.
2653.04,It begins to just all
melt,away in a warm glow.
2659.07,No psychedelics required.
2661.05,But the interesting
point,there is
2664.56,that when you ask
"yourself,","OK, so"
2667.62,because as a consequence
of,"the eyes' anatomy,"
2670.26,there's this thing
you,can see that is
2674.28,absent from your experience.
2676.92,But the question
"is,",where is that
2679.83,in relationship to the
rest,"of you, to your mind?"
2683.29,Is that deep within?
2684.48,Or is that in some sense right
on,the surface of experience?
2687.76,And there's expectation
that,people have.
2691.31,"Again, I think"
conflating,meditation
2694.01,with a search for changes in
the,context of consciousness.
2697.49,They're looking for
much,more subtle things
2701.84,to notice about the mind or
much,vaster things to notice.
2707.03,Psychedelics sets
up,this expectation
2709.88,that you do a massive
dose,"of mushrooms or LSD,"
2714.11,and everything changes.
2716.15,"I mean, you get this"
full,beatific vision.
2720.17,And you get not only visual
"changes,",but emotional changes.
2725.12,"And you get synesthesia,"
where,you have
2729.26,much more mind in so many ways.
2733.8,So they begin having
these,"experiences,"
2736.97,or reading the mystical
"literature,","you begin to think,"
2739.35,"OK, well, then freedom is really"
elsewhere,or it's deep within.
2745.1,It's not coincident with
the,ordinary awareness
2750.32,that can see this
coffee,cup clearly
2753.92,and that can just
transition,attention
2755.69,to reading an email
with,the full sobriety
2760.55,of ordinary waking
consciousness.,
2764.63,"But the truth is, this"
insight,"into selflessness,"
2767.39,this insight into the nonduality
of,"subject and object,"
2770.93,is as close to ordinary
consciousness,as this insight
2776.51,into the optic blind spot.
2778.13,Where do you have to
go,to have this insight
2780.267,into the blind spot?
2781.1,you don't have to go anywhere.
2783.3,You just have to set up the
experiment,correctly such
2786.29,that you can see the data.
2791.13,But the data is
right,on the surface.
2792.81,It's almost too close
to,you to notice.
2795.39,If it's at all hard
to,"notice, it's"
2797.79,"because it's so close,"
rather,than it's
2799.98,deep within or far away.
2802.18,And there are other
analogies,like--
2804.973,I don't even remember.
2805.89,"There's Mind's Eye,"
pieces,"of artwork,"
2807.81,that were the random
dot,"stereo grams, where"
2810.43,we have an image that pops out.
2812.28,I always find it very difficult
to,see those because I
2814.53,have a very dominant eye.
2816.39,But some people can see.
2817.44,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
People,can't see those.
2819.107,These images that used to
be,at the touristy shops.
2821.468,"But people say, oh,"
there,"it is, the whale."
2823.26,"And I'm thinking,"
I,don't see it.
2826.11,Kids that swim a lot
when,"they're younger,"
2828.75,and they tend to breathe
just,to one side--
2831.202,I don't know if this was you.
2832.41,This was definitely me.
2833.368,They tend to keep
one,eye closed.
2836.22,You set up a pretty
strong,ocular dominance.
2838.74,Biasing your vision to one or
the,"other eye early in life,"
2841.422,whether or not you're learning
how,to be a bow hunter
2843.63,or you're learning how
to,throw darts or shoot
2846.12,"billiards or anything that,"
involves,selectively viewing
2850.253,the world through one eye
for,even a couple of hours
2852.42,can set up a permanent
asymmetry,in the weighting
2859.185,flow of visual information
from,the eye to the brain.
2861.81,"It's reversible, but only"
through,the reverse gymnastics
2864.48,of covering up the
other,eye intentionally.
2866.43,So actually I had to be
reversed-patched,for a while
2868.71,because I was seeing
"double,",because I
2869.85,lost binocular vision.
2870.9,I don't stand a chance in hell
of,seeing an image pop out
2876.21,of a random dot
"stereogram,",which
2877.98,is kind of ironic because I did
my,PhD on binocular circuitry.
2881.19,"But nonetheless, if"
people,"can see these,"
2886.82,"or if they can't, I"
think,they provide
2889.293,a really terrific
example,of what you're
2890.96,"talking about as a larger theme,"
which,is that perceptually you
2894.237,see a bunch of dots.
2895.07,"And then all of a sudden,"
what,you thought wasn't there
2898.8,"is suddenly there, but"
can,just disappear again.
2901.46,There are certain
visual,"illusions,"
2903.05,"if we were to include others,"
that,"once you see them,"
2905.51,you cannot unsee them.
2907.01,"So there's the faces-vases,"
figure-ground,type stuff.
2911.96,SAM HARRIS: Bi-stable percepts.
2913.4,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Bi-stable,percepts.
2914.9,And then there's sort
of,ocular competition.
2917.42,You show two different images to
the,"eyes, each of the two eyes."
2920.48,And it is near
impossible,for people
2923.18,to perceive them
both,simultaneously.
2925.662,So it's a little bit of
what,you're describing.
2927.62,"I mean, these seem to"
be,fundamental features
2929.18,about the way the neural
circuits,"are organized,"
2931.37,that they don't want to stay
fixated,on any one thing
2935.6,for very long.
2936.26,"To do so either takes training,"
intense,"interest, intense fear,"
2939.8,intense excitement.
2941.12,"When I say intense, I guess,"
I,come back to this idea
2943.37,that the autonomic
nervous,system is somehow
2945.203,governing our ability to
spotlight,at any one location
2949.19,for very long.
2950.45,Is that a useful framework?
2951.93,Or is that going to take
us,down a different path?
2953.61,"SAM HARRIS: Well, it's sort"
of,a different path for this.
2955.985,"I mean, the only"
point,I was making
2957.98,is that the
seemingly,paradoxical
2961.01,claim that something can
be,right on the surface
2964.25,and yet hard to see.
2969.8,"And again, this seems to"
justify,the expectation held
2974.78,"by, I would think,"
the,vast majority
2976.88,of people who get interested
in,"these spiritual things,"
2980.75,"for lack of a better word,"
that,the truth must somehow
2985.34,be deep within.
2988.13,There's some distance between
the,one who is looking
2992.93,and the thing that
has,to be found right
2995.06,and that you have to go through
this,long evolution of changes.
2998.357,"I mean, there are many"
metaphors,that set this up.
3000.44,It's like you're at
the,"base of a mountain,"
3002.232,and you have to
climb,to the top.
3004.1,And so you have
to,"find the path,"
3006.2,however secure it
is,to get you there.
3010.24,But there really is a distance
between,your starting point
3014.11,and the goal.
3015.05,And what I'm arguing--
3017.29,"and this is a kind of a nondual,"
to,use a term of jargon--
3023.83,this is a nondual
approach,"to meditation,"
3027.04,as opposed to a dualistic one.
3029.44,The path and the
goal,"are coincident,"
3034.42,that you have to unravel the
logic,by which you would seek
3039.07,something that's outside
of,the present moment's
3042.97,"experience, i.e. not available,"
really,not available to you
3047.59,now.
3049.45,Because so many things
worth,"having, so many skills"
3053.96,"worth acquiring, really are"
not,available to you now.
3057.23,It's like if you
want,"to be a pianist,"
3059.46,or if you want to
speak,"Chinese, there's"
3062.42,something you don't know.
3063.807,And then you want
to,learn that thing.
3065.39,And there's a whole process.
3067.07,And you might not be
capable,of doing it.
3070.28,And real mastery is far away.
3073.07,If you've never hit
a,"golf ball, and you"
3075.41,want to hit a golf ball
300,"yards straight,"
3078.747,I can pretty much
guarantee,you're not
3080.33,going to do that initially.
3081.71,And you're not going
to,do it on day two.
3084.02,And you're not going to do it
reliably,for the longest time.
3087.23,And there's real
training,in front of you
3090.26,to be able to do that reliably.
3094.26,"An insight into, and"
really,"the core insight,"
3098.43,"I mean, the insight that is the"
core,"of the Buddha's teaching,"
3101.88,to take one historical
example,"of this,"
3107.44,really is available now.
3113.08,"I mean, granted, it can be"
very,"hard, one, for people."
3115.88,"I mean, I had"
probably,spent a year
3118.39,on silent retreat in one week
to,three month increments
3122.56,before I got the
point,I'm making now.
3128.69,"I mean, literally,"
these,are retreats
3131.39,where you spend 12 to 18
hours,"a day just meditating,"
3135.59,trying to unpack the kinds
of,claims I'm making now.
3143.3,So it's possible to
rigorously,overlook this.
3147.78,It's possible to stand in
front,of the mind's eye image
3150.8,and stare in a way
that,is guaranteed
3153.86,not to give you
pop,out and to be
3156.53,adept at staring in that way.
3159.84,So it's possible to be misled.
3161.42,And so what I'm
trying,to argue here
3163.1,is that there's a fair
amount,of leverage
3166.36,you can get with better
"information,",which
3169.03,can cut the time course of
your,searching for this thing
3172.0,and cancel your false
expectations,about just
3174.76,where this is in relation
to,your ordinary waking
3177.64,consciousness.
3179.65,And it's possible to
get,bad information
3182.5,and to have a bunch
of,experiences.
3184.37,You go you go and do
an,ayahuasca trip.
3187.3,And it's incredibly valuable.
3189.31,And it's valuable
for,all the ways
3190.93,in which it changed the
contents,of your consciousness
3193.24,in startling ways.
3194.98,And you had insights
into,your past
3196.72,and into your relationships
and,into why you're
3198.88,not as loving as you might be.
3200.38,And there's lots to think about.
3201.85,"And you're like, OK,"
that's,all great.
3203.44,That's all something
that,we can talk about.
3206.26,But it truly is orthogonal.
3210.13,"I mean, it makes a"
point,"of contact,"
3211.63,"or what I'm talking about,"
it's,really just at one point.
3214.36,And it's at the point
where,this sense
3218.37,of subject-object
division,in consciousness
3221.37,is illusory and vulnerable
to,investigation.
3224.92,And if you investigate it as
the,right plane of focus--
3229.26,you pick the analogy you
"want,",whether it's setting up
3233.43,the optic blind spot experiment
in,"just the right way,"
3238.08,so that you can see that
the,data is not there.
3244.02,"I mean, the bi-stable percept is"
great,because when you see one
3248.76,"of these images, like"
the,"vase-face diagram,"
3252.78,or the Dalmatian that it
looks,"like a mess of dots,"
3256.2,and then you see the image
of,a Dalmatian dog pop out--
3260.04,"once you see it, you"
really,can't unsee it.
3263.44,"I mean, once you have the"
requisite,conceptual anchor
3267.94,"to it, then every time you look,"
you're,going to find it again.
3271.51,"And eventually, it"
becomes,effortless.
3273.64,"And that's what,"
"ultimately,","meditation is,"
3276.16,"I mean, this kind of meditation."
3277.72,You ultimately
learn,to recognize
3281.77,that there's no
separation,between you
3284.59,and your experience.
3285.91,There's not the
experience,on the one hand
3288.16,and the self on the other.
3290.5,There's just experience.
3292.54,"There's just seeing, hearing,"
"smelling,","tasting, touching,"
3295.0,"thinking, feeling,"
"proprioception,",
3297.13,add whatever channels of
information,you want to that.
3301.48,But there's just the totality
of,the energy of consciousness
3308.07,and its contents.
3308.91,And it's not that
you're,on the riverbank.
3313.83,And this is how it can
seem,"in the beginning,"
3316.02,even when you're practicing
meditation,fairly diligently.
3319.08,You can seem like
you're,"on the riverbank,"
3321.0,watching the contents of
consciousness,flow by.
3323.61,And meditation is the act
of,doing that more and more
3328.59,"dispassionately, so you're no"
longer,grabbing at the pleasant
3331.648,or pushing the unpleasant away.
3332.94,You're just kind of relaxing in
the,most non-judgmental frame
3337.65,"of mind, just"
witnessing,the flow.
3341.73,But if you're doing
that,"dualisticly,"
3344.82,you feel like the meditator.
3346.32,You feel like the
subject,aiming attention.
3348.58,And so now you're
on,the riverbank
3350.07,watching everything go past.
3351.96,"But the truth is,"
you,are the river.
3356.22,Experience itself is that there
is,just experience itself.
3359.52,You're not on the
edge,of experience.
3361.95,And everything you can
notice,is part of the flow.
3367.02,And there's no point from
which,to abstract yourself away
3371.04,from the flow to
stand,outside it
3373.95,"and to say, OK, this is my life."
3376.45,This is my experience.
3377.56,This is my body.
3378.54,"Yes, you can do that."
3379.53,"I mean, those are"
all,just thoughts.
3381.03,But that's more of the flow.
3382.65,And so there's a process by
which,you would eventually
3386.79,recognize that there's
no,distance between you
3390.66,and your experience.
3391.66,"And again, you can wait"
for,those moments in life
3394.2,where experience gets so
"good,","or so terrifying,"
3398.28,it's just so salient.
3400.56,Your amygdala is
driving,so hard.
3402.66,"I mean, so you're"
in,"a war, and you"
3404.67,can't think about anything
because,the enemy is
3407.13,shooting at you.
3407.85,And this is the most
thrilling,video game
3409.558,you've ever played in your life.
3410.97,And your life is on the line.
3412.41,Or you're at the peak
of,"some athletic event,"
3417.27,where you don't know how you're
doing,"the things you're doing,"
3421.32,but it's all happening
automatically.,
3424.77,But those are 1/100
of,1% of one's life.
3431.31,And you know what I'm
calling,meditation
3434.24,is a way of simply understanding
the,mechanics of a tension
3439.38,whereby you are denying yourself
that,unity of experience
3443.55,so much of the time and
recognizing,that it's
3447.36,based on a misperception
of,the way consciousness
3451.29,always already is.
3452.105,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, if"
there,wasn't an incentive
3454.23,to learn how to meditate
"properly,",that was one.
3460.63,And I've been meditating
for,a fair amount
3463.24,"since I was in my teens, but"
more,along the lines of paying
3466.45,attention to breath and
open-observer,"type meditation,"
3473.26,or focused-attention.
3474.285,I would suppose more of
the,focused-attention type.
3476.41,We'll get into these
a,little bit later.
3477.61,But I have a number of questions
related,to what you just said.
3480.235,SAM HARRIS: Sure.
3482.35,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love the idea
that,this thing that we would
3487.69,all do well to understand to
observe,consciousness of self
3492.43,as opposed to trying to alter
the,contents of consciousness
3497.5,may sit much closer to
us,than one might think.
3503.35,And because it sits
so,"close to us,"
3506.22,that might be one of the
reasons,why we miss it.
3508.5,I go right to a
visual,system example.
3510.81,"I mean, if you're"
wearing,corrective lenses
3513.58,and there's a
speck,"on your lens,"
3515.13,typically you're looking
out,"through the lens,"
3517.047,and so you wouldn't
observe,that speck.
3518.91,Any number of different
analogies,could work here.
3521.22,The fact that there
are,"states, however"
3525.21,"few, positive and negative,"
extreme,ecstasy and extreme
3530.91,"fear being the two, I"
"think,",most obvious ones
3533.85,that seems like
we,"agree on, that"
3535.29,allow us to capture the
sense,of completeness of self
3539.28,or the unity of the
observer,and the actor.
3545.33,The fact that those are
seldom,"for the nontrained,"
3548.81,"for the nonmeditator,"
suggests,to me two things.
3552.44,I think one perhaps worth
exploring,more than the other.
3555.56,But one is that what's really
being,revealed in the states
3560.33,where we can feel the
unity,of the observer
3562.28,and the actor is understanding
something,fundamental
3565.67,"about the algorithm, not"
the,"online algorithm,"
3568.535,but the algorithm that
is,our nervous system.
3570.41,Just as you mentioned
cephalopods.,
3572.24,"I mean, mantis shrimp see an"
enormous,array of color hues
3575.75,that we don't.
3578.15,Their maps and
representations,of the world
3579.95,are fundamentally different.
3581.117,Pit vipers see in the infrared.
3583.38,We're restricted to
somewhat,of a limited range
3585.65,within the color
"spectrum,",but still more
3587.6,vast than that of dogs or cats.
3590.33,So understanding
that,for seeing what
3594.04,a pit viper can see for
moments,would be informative.
3598.7,Perhaps sensing-heat emissions
as,"a human might be invasive,"
3604.097,maybe that's why we don't do it.
3605.43,"So the question is, to just"
make,"it straightforward,"
3611.1,why would the system
be,designed this way?
3614.07,"Again, neither of us were"
consulted,in the design phase.
3616.472,"But that brings me to, perhaps,"
the,more tractable question
3618.93,"was, which is about development."
3622.29,I'm a great believer that the
neural,circuits that encouraged
3627.51,"healthy parent-child relations,"
or,unhealthy parent-child
3630.45,relations as the case
may,"be, in childhood stem"
3632.82,from the initial
demands,of internal
3635.282,"versus external states, which"
is,exactly what we're talking
3637.74,"about, which is that a young"
child,feels anxious because it
3640.59,needs his diaper change.
3641.59,It doesn't really know it needs
its,diaper changed or it's cold
3644.55,or it's uncomfortable or it's
hungry,or it's overly full.
3647.76,And so it vocalizes.
3649.052,And then some external
source,comes to us
3650.76,and relieves that hopefully.
3652.552,And so the fundamental
rule,that we first learn
3654.51,is not that we have a self or
that,"things fall down, not up."
3658.98,But it's that when
"uncomfortable,",
3663.15,externalize that discomfort.
3664.98,And it will be relieved
by,an outside player.
3666.89,"And then, of course, there's a"
repurposing,of that circuitry
3669.39,for adult romantic attachments.
3670.8,I don't think
anyone,doubts that.
3672.63,And that can explain a lot
indeed,about attachment
3675.16,and so forth.
3677.23,So something about our
developmental,wiring
3680.4,and the algorithms that
these,neural circuits run
3683.97,"tend to bias most people,"
the,"nonpractice meditators,"
3688.14,to live a somewhat
functional,life at least
3694.92,without this awareness
of,actor and observer.
3698.64,And so what you're
really,talking about
3700.65,is a deliberate intervention
to,understand and resolve
3706.59,that gap in the algorithm.
3708.775,Do I have that right?
3709.65,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
3709.99,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I'm,more or less
3710.58,restating what you said
in,"a way that, I'm hoping,"
3712.8,will serve as a
jumping,off point.
3714.84,Why questions are always very
dangerous,"in biology, or any."
3720.568,SAM HARRIS: Or in relationship.
3721.86,ANDREW HUBERMAN: What's that?
3722.37,SAM HARRIS: Or in relationship.
3723.18,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Or,in relationship.
3723.93,Right.
3724.43,Exactly.
3725.038,"Although, I think it all"
does,really hearken back
3727.08,to this early
developmental,"wiring which,"
3728.61,"of course, is modifiable."
3729.652,That's the beauty of
the,"nervous system is,"
3732.42,it's the one organ that seems
to,be able to change itself
3734.91,at least to some degree.
3738.71,So what are your thoughts
about,the organization
3741.08,of the circuitry to essentially
under,normal conditions to not
3744.89,reveal what seems to be one of
its,more important and profound
3748.76,"and, for dare I say,"
enlightening,features.
3753.92,It's almost as if we are
potentially,like mantis shrimp.
3757.16,We can see so many more
colors,than we actually see.
3761.18,"And yet, we don't."
3764.54,Most people opt not to.
3766.68,And I would argue that
one,of the great strengths
3770.57,of the Waking Up
"app,","for instance,"
3772.49,is that it essentially walks
you,through the process of being
3775.67,able to arrive at these
things,without having
3778.16,to go to one-year or three-year
long,silent meditation
3782.75,retreats.
3783.35,So if you could just elaborate
for,a moment before we move on.
3786.08,What are your thoughts
about,how the circuitry is
3788.18,arranged by default versus--
3790.64,and what that means for there
to,"be an intervention, that we"
3795.5,have to intervene in the self
in,order to reveal the self.
3798.71,"SAM HARRIS: Well, so there"
are,"two big questions there,"
3801.603,one about evolution and
one,about development.
3803.52,So with respect
to,"evolution, it's"
3807.62,important to recognize
that,evolution doesn't
3811.28,see our deepest concerns
about,human flourishing
3815.06,and human well-being.
3816.08,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
all,about the offspring.
3818.48,SAM HARRIS: We are set up
to,spawn and to survive
3822.5,long enough to help our progeny
spawn,if we can do that.
3827.21,And that's it.
3828.92,And so anything that was
good,"for that, including"
3833.18,tribalism and xenophobia and all
kinds,of hardware and software
3841.1,flaws that revealed
themselves,to be flaws
3844.602,"in the present time, when"
we're,trying to build
3846.56,a viable global civilization.
3848.78,But they redounded to the
advantage,of our ancestors
3852.47,"somehow, or there are things"
about,us that were simply not
3856.76,"selected for, they"
just,came along
3858.32,"for the ride, what Stephen"
Jay,Gould called a spandrel.
3863.63,So we are not set
up,by evolution
3868.31,to be as happy as
we,possibly can be
3872.99,and to do almost anything
that,interests us well.
3877.01,"I mean, we're not"
set,up by evolution
3878.75,to be mathematicians
or,musicians
3881.66,or to create democracies
that,are healthy.
3885.08,"I mean, evolution"
can,see none of this.
3887.78,And we are doing
these,things based
3891.17,on cognitive and
emotional,hardware
3895.46,that we are leveraging
in,new directions.
3898.49,"I mean, we are primates."
3900.32,And we're communicating
with,small mouth noises.
3903.807,"I mean, we're"
language-using,primates.
3905.39,And all of that is
clearly,evolved.
3909.36,And we're doing these amazing
"things,",including science.
3912.44,"However improbably,"
where,we're actually
3914.96,"able to, almost"
entirely,"with language,"
3920.75,understand reality
that,at a scale
3924.2,that exceeds us in
both,"directions,"
3926.12,"I mean, the very vast and"
the,"very small, and also"
3929.42,"temporally, the very old."
3931.43,We have visions
of,the far future.
3933.56,We can figure out
where,an asteroid
3936.14,is going to cross Earth's
orbit,"1,000 years from now"
3940.01,if we just do the math.
3941.09,And it's amazing that we
can,"do all of those things,"
3943.257,but evolution is
blind,to all of that.
3945.98,And so in terms of what we care
about,and certainly in terms
3951.58,of what's going to ensure
our,"survival as a species,"
3955.12,we have flown the perch that
was,created for us by evolution.
3958.57,"I mean, it's not just"
the,primate things.
3961.7,And so it is with learning
how,to regulate our emotions
3966.22,and punch through
to,a self concept
3970.09,or beyond a self
concept,that is more
3972.52,"normative, psychologically, that"
allows,us to not be terrorized
3978.1,by our ape-ish genes as
fully,"as we seem to be,"
3982.78,even in the presence of more
and,more destructive technology.
3986.35,"I mean, we're still"
practically,chimpanzees armed
3990.85,with nuclear weapons.
3991.99,And that is increasingly
dysfunctional.,
3994.6,And very soon we're going to
be,"in the presence of minds,"
3998.89,"or apparent minds,"
that,we have built
4001.02,that are as
intelligent,as we are
4003.75,"and very quickly, probably 15"
minutes,"after that, far more"
4006.99,intelligent than we are.
4008.14,And so what we do with all
of,"that is, again, something"
4011.64,that we have to figure out
based,"on the minds we have,"
4017.19,"the minds we can build,"
the,minds we can change.
4021.0,We can meddle with
our,own genomes now.
4022.95,And that will produce
its,own consequences
4027.15,in ourselves and in
future,generations
4030.66,if we meddle with the germline.
4032.28,"And again, all of that"
is,just evolution.
4036.45,It's just sort of the
womb,"we came out of,"
4038.31,but it didn't
anticipate,any of that.
4042.93,Mother nature simply not had
our,best interests at heart.
4046.5,"And we might die off, and"
from,the point of view
4049.98,of mother nature that's fine
because,99% of every species
4054.18,dies off.
4058.0,So there's that.
4059.75,But when you're talking
about,"the individual,"
4063.34,developmentally-- we all
come,"into this world,"
4065.71,"again, as a fairly"
hairless,primate
4070.3,that needs a tremendous
amount,of care by others.
4072.82,And the logic of that is
that,the reason why we're not
4080.32,a gazelle that can run 45
minutes,"later and then,"
4083.83,"basically, do all the"
gazelle,things perfectly soon
4087.91,thereafter.
4090.22,The reason why we have
this,"time of immaturity,"
4097.3,and has become
functional,"for us,"
4099.34,is that we're far
more,"flexible, and we"
4103.06,can learn based on the needs
of,an environment to do so much
4108.279,more than a gazelle can.
4109.81,And language is part of that.
4112.359,And in the last
"10,000","years or so,"
4118.02,culture increasingly has been
more,and more a part of that.
4120.81,And there's probably a layer
at,which we can plausibly
4123.479,talk about cultural evolution
and,cultural evolution
4126.45,interacting with biological
evolution,to change us.
4130.245,But when you're talking
about,the development
4132.12,"of an individual, each of us"
comes,"into this world, I think,"
4138.39,not recognizing
ourselves,in any sense
4142.14,that would make sense to reify.
4146.937,"I mean, it's not that"
there's,nothing there.
4148.77,"I mean, there could be some kind"
of,proto-self differentiation.
4151.68,But I think it
takes,a long while.
4155.399,And there is very
likely,a coincidence
4159.0,between really
recognizing,others.
4163.26,We recognize others first.
4165.24,certainly in
relationship,immediately.
4166.95,And we orient to human faces.
4168.6,And we even detect other humans
as,good and bad moral actors
4174.743,"very early, I mean,"
certainly,long
4176.16,before we recognize
ourselves,in a mirror.
4180.569,"The experiments run, again, this"
is,"Paul Blume and colleagues,"
4184.71,experiments run on the
moral,hardware and software
4189.12,of developing toddlers.
4191.723,But I think at
this,"point, they've"
4193.14,pushed it down all the
way,"to six months of age,"
4195.93,where you'll get these infants
staring,at a puppet show.
4199.38,And they'll show
a,greater interest
4204.49,in classically good actors
versus,"bad actors, cooperators"
4208.68,"versus defectors, in"
various,puppet show games.
4215.08,So it's not that we have no
mind,and no proto-awareness
4221.08,"of others and of self, but"
what,"eventually happens,"
4225.58,certainly as we become at
all,"facile with language use,"
4230.98,is that we become aware
that,not only are we
4235.33,"in relationship to others,"
but,we are an object
4238.24,in the world for them.
4240.25,So we have enough people
pointing,at us in our cribs
4244.87,and impinging upon
our,experience.
4247.99,"You're being physically moved,"
and,"prodded, and touched,"
4251.53,"and consoled, or not consoled."
4254.08,And just imagine
what,all of these--
4256.54,you're on the receiving end
of,"10,000 interventions."
4260.77,And you're completely
helpless,for the longest time.
4264.19,And all of that
"attention,",you have
4266.38,all of these people
coming,up to the crib
4268.87,and making faces at you--
4270.183,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Cheering,for you.
4271.6,SAM HARRIS: And it's
all,pointed at you.
4274.15,There's a classic
magical,narcissism
4278.38,that gets constructed
there,if you
4281.65,take the psychological
"literature,",at least
4284.68,a certain strand
of,"it, seriously."
4287.26,And I think it's largely apt
to,think of a child at that age
4293.44,as a kind of--
4298.46,there is a kind of
narcissistic,structure
4300.98,"there, where it's all"
kind,of going inward.
4304.19,And at a certain point
you,"realize, OK, I'm"
4308.9,the center of all of this.
4311.03,It's not just a movie where
you're,"completely absorbed in,"
4318.14,and you've lost
your,sense of self.
4320.0,"I mean, to talk to yet"
another,example of what
4325.237,it's like as a grown up
to,lose our sense of self.
4327.32,And one of the things I
think,we find so fascinating
4330.5,about television and film
is,that when we get totally
4333.77,"absorbed in it, we're in this"
very,unusual circumstance where
4337.67,our brain is
basically,reading it
4340.52,as we're in the classic
social,circumstance.
4343.28,We're presented with the facial
displays,of other people.
4347.91,"In fact, sometimes these"
people,are 10 feet tall
4351.62,or their faces are 10 feet tall.
4353.3,You have a close-up
in,a movie theater.
4355.2,"So it's like a super stimulus,"
in,terms of evolution.
4359.51,And they can be making direct
eye,"contact with a camera,"
4363.89,so you have this gigantic
face,staring at you.
4366.53,"And yet, you're totally"
uncomplicated,socially.
4368.87,You can't be seen.
4370.25,And something you know
you,can't be seen.
4372.78,And so you completely
lose,self consciousness.
4377.0,"And yet, you're able to examine"
with,"completely free attention,"
4381.77,"again, because you're"
totally,"unimplicated,"
4384.98,the facial minutia and the
mimetic,facial play of people
4391.55,at a very close range.
4394.25,"I mean, you have physically"
just,"about to kiss your spouse,"
4400.97,like that's what a
close-up,is in a film.
4403.89,You never get that
close,to people.
4406.52,"And yet, here you're"
in,a situation
4408.68,where you're unobserved.
4409.74,And you know that.
4410.49,"And so I mean, this"
is,"a bit of a tangent,"
4412.91,but it's the other side
of,what's happening
4415.34,developmentally for a kid.
4418.97,When you're in a movie
theater,"watching a movie,"
4421.19,you are truly invisible.
4422.99,"And yet, you're right there."
4425.99,However harrowing
the,human drama
4428.66,"is, you're seeing it play out."
4430.22,And you're seeing it up close.
4432.02,"And it is, in principle,"
a,social encounter
4435.35,that your genes are ready
"for,",but they're not ready
4438.23,for you to be invisible.
4439.46,And so that's what's
so,magical about it.
4442.77,But what happens developmentally
for,a kid is that you're not
4445.82,"invisible, you are an"
object,that is constantly
4448.4,"being overrun, the boundaries"
of,your sensory engagement
4455.12,with the world are constantly
being,impinged upon by others.
4458.12,"And at a certain point,"
you,"recognize, OK, I'm"
4461.78,at the center of this.
4462.89,And the way this gets
enshrined,"as a self, I think"
4468.83,is probably coincident
with,our learning
4472.43,the language game we
learn,to play with others.
4475.97,We're talking to others.
4477.11,People are talking to us.
4478.4,"And at a certain point,"
we're,"talking to ourselves,"
4482.33,even when the other
people,leave the room.
4484.76,And you can hear it.
4485.66,If you ever have
been,with a toddler
4487.37,when they're externalizing
their,"self-talk,"
4491.87,you hear them talking
to,themselves.
4493.46,They're playing.
4494.127,And they're having
a,conversation.
4496.11,They were talking
to,"you, the parent."
4498.02,"But then you left the room,"
and,they're still talking.
4500.33,"You come back in, and"
they're,still talking.
4502.49,And what happens
to,"us, strangely,"
4507.72,and this comes back to
the,"logic of evolution,"
4512.17,we never stop because
evolution,never
4515.95,thought to build us an
off-switch,for this.
4518.2,"I mean, language is so useful."
4520.69,And it gets tuned up
so,strongly for us.
4524.26,And there was never a
reason,to shut it off.
4526.178,There was never a reason
to,give you this ability
4528.22,"to say, oh, wouldn't it be nice"
to,have four hours of quiet
4530.95,"now, like no self-talk."
4533.32,And so for most of
"us,","I mean, I think"
4535.0,"there are people who, for"
whatever,neurological reason
4537.88,"or idiosyncratic reason,"
undoubtedly,there'd
4541.39,be a neurological reason for
"it,",don't have any self-talk.
4546.13,But for most of
"us,",we are covertly
4550.36,talking basically all the time.
4553.36,And there's an
imagistic,component
4556.11,of this for many people.
4557.11,You're visualizing
things,as well.
4558.64,But there's just a ton of
white,noise in the mind that
4565.06,feels a certain way.
4566.5,And what you discover
in,"meditation,"
4569.77,"ultimately, is that"
the,self is what
4574.23,it feels like to be
thinking,without knowing
4576.54,that you're thinking.
4577.64,A thought arises uninspected
and,seems to just become you.
4582.72,Like you and I are talking now.
4584.25,And people are listening to us.
4587.09,They're struggling to follow
the,train of this conversation
4590.45,because it is competing
with,the conversation that's
4593.0,happening in their heads.
4594.47,So I'll be saying something.
4595.97,And a person listening will
"say,","well, what does that mean?"
4600.95,"Or like, oh, but wait a minute,"
he,just contradicted himself.
4604.52,And there's a voice
in,your head that
4606.35,is also vying for your
attention,much of the time.
4611.51,So the first discovery
people,make in meditation
4614.63,is that it's just so
hard,to pay attention
4616.61,"to anything, the breath,"
or,"a mantra, or a sound,"
4619.76,"whatever it is, because"
you're,thinking.
4624.273,You're thinking about the thing
you,need to do in an hour.
4626.69,"And oh, it's so good that"
I,downloaded this app.
4628.927,This is really good.
4629.76,This is going to be good for me.
4631.093,But that chatter
isn't,showing up.
4635.0,You're not far back enough in
the,"theater of consciousness,"
4641.28,so as to see it emerge.
4642.71,It is just sneaking
up,behind you.
4644.87,And it feels like me again.
4646.88,It feels like when someone is
thinking,"the thought, well,"
4650.76,what the hell does that mean?
4652.67,They're not seeing
it,as an emerging
4655.07,object in consciousness.
4656.39,It just feels like me.
4661.76,"Subjectively, is like"
the,mind contracts
4665.06,around this appearance
in,consciousness.
4668.33,And it really is just a sound
with,the voice of the mind.
4672.56,If you actually can inspect
"it,",it is deeply inscrutable
4677.78,that we ever feel identified
with,our thoughts.
4680.03,"I mean, how is it that"
we,could be a thought?
4683.42,A thought just arises
and,passes away.
4685.31,"And when you inspect it,"
when,"you go to inspect it,"
4689.94,it unravels.
4692.07,It's the least substantial
possible,thing.
4697.11,"But yet, it could be a"
thought,of self-hatred.
4701.37,"It could be a thought,"
that,"unrecognized,"
4704.88,totally defines your mood.
4711.47,"I mean, again, this all"
can,seem kind of abstract.
4714.777,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Well,","no, but I think"
4716.36,it's extremely concrete
from,the perspective
4718.82,of the neural circuits
that,will return
4720.62,to maybe in a few minutes.
4722.31,I'd like to take a
brief,break and thank
4724.61,our sponsor Inside Tracker.
4726.86,Inside Tracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
4729.5,that analyzes data
from,your blood and DNA
4731.96,to help me better
understand,your body
4733.67,and help you reach
your,health goals.
4735.47,I've long been a believer in
getting,regular blood work done
4738.08,for the simple reason that
many,of the factors that impact
4741.032,your immediate and
long,term health
4742.49,can only be analyzed from
a,quality blood test.
4745.025,The problem with a lot
of,blood and DNA tests
4746.9,"out there. however,"
is,that you get data
4748.85,"back about metabolic factors,"
"lipids,","and hormones,"
4751.39,"and so forth, but you don't"
know,what to do with those data.
4753.89,Inside Tracker
solves,that problem
4755.87,and makes it very easy
for,you to understand
4758.06,"what sorts of nutritional,"
"behavioral,",maybe even
4761.66,supplementation-based
"interventions,",
4763.94,you might want to
take,on in order
4765.62,to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic,"factors, hormones,"
4768.29,"lipids, and other"
things,that impact
4770.0,your immediate and long-term
health,to bring those numbers
4772.73,into the ranges
that,are appropriate
4774.53,and indeed optimal for you.
4776.3,If you'd like to
try,"Inside Tracker,"
4777.83,you can visit
insidetracker.com/huberman,
4780.35,and get 20% off any of
Inside,Tracker's plans.
4782.9,That's
insidetracker.com/huberman,
4785.51,to get 20% off.
4786.83,If you could elaborate a bit on
this,notion of internal chatter
4790.37,and external stimuli and
the,bridge between them
4794.03,because I think for some
people,that might be intuitive.
4797.39,"I think for others,"
it's,not so obvious
4802.34,that language is
ongoing,in the backdrop.
4808.738,"And then sometimes, I"
think,some people are
4810.53,more tuned into that language.
4814.28,"For some people,"
it's,louder volume.
4816.02,"For some people,"
it's,more structured.
4819.612,I have a colleague
at,Stanford who's
4822.77,been on this podcast
called,Deisseroth.
4824.54,"He's one of, like, the"
preeminent,bioengineers.
4826.19,He's also a psychiatrist.
4827.232,And he has a--
4827.96,he doesn't call it a
meditative,"practice,"
4829.44,but he has a practice
where,"each evening,"
4831.148,after his five kids are put
down,"to sleep, you know--"
4834.27,they're older now--
4837.02,and in the quiet of the
late,"hours of the night,"
4841.44,"early morning, he"
sits,and forces
4843.11,himself to think in
complete,"sentences,"
4844.91,"with punctuation, for an hour."
4847.118,This is the way that he has
taught,himself to structure
4849.41,"his thinking, because of"
the,very fact that you're
4851.99,"describing, which is"
that,"ordinarily, there"
4854.06,is an underlying structure
to,"what's internal,"
4856.49,but it's disrupted by external
"events,",And these are--
4860.36,"typically, it's"
not,coherent enough
4863.24,to really make meaning from.
4865.012,So it's almost like
somebody,sitting down
4866.72,to write in complete
"sentences,",but forcing
4868.512,himself to do it in his head.
4870.11,"But for many people,"
including,"myself,"
4872.06,that's a foreign experience.
4873.98,And we only experience structure
through,our interactions
4877.34,with the world and other people.
4879.95,I've taken the time to try and
explore,ideas with eyes closed.
4884.48,And I've been able to do that.
4886.827,There are certain
pharmacologic,states
4888.41,that we could talk about
that,facilitate that.
4890.63,"And no, those are"
not,amphetamines.
4892.31,Those do exactly the
"opposite,",by the way.
4894.98,But I think people
exist,in varying degrees
4900.5,of structured and unstructured
internal,"dialogue,"
4904.58,and in varying
depths,of recognition
4908.81,of that internal dialogue.
4910.53,"And so the question,"
I,"suppose, is,"
4912.5,just the recognition that
there's,"a dialogue ongoing,"
4915.89,"internally-- is that,"
"itself,",valuable?
4918.122,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
4918.83,And that also can
take,some time.
4921.02,"So, I mean, here's"
a,claim I would
4922.97,make that some people
might,find surprising.
4925.91,But I think this is an
objectively,true claim about
4931.16,"the subjectivity of most people,"
which,is that unless you have
4935.872,a fair amount of training--
let's,say you just happen to be
4938.33,some kind of savant in this
"area,","which most people,"
4940.91,"by definition, aren't, or"
you,have a remarkable amount
4944.15,of training in what's called
concentration,practice
4947.63,in meditation--
4950.21,I believe this is a true claim--
that,if we just put a stopwatch
4955.16,"on this table, and people"
could,just watch it 30 seconds
4959.48,"elapse, and I set all of our"
"listeners,","or your viewers,"
4965.9,"the task, for the"
next,"30 seconds,"
4969.99,just pay attention to anything--
your,"breath, you know,"
4973.07,"or the sight of your hand,"
or,"the sight of the clock,"
4976.94,or any object--
4979.55,"without getting lost in thought,"
without,getting momentarily
4982.82,distracted by this conversation
you're,having with yourself.
4990.027,A couple of things would happen.
4991.36,One is no one would be
able,"to do it, right?"
4994.5,And this is not just a
superficial,inability.
5000.26,"I mean, if your"
life,"depended on it,"
5002.01,you wouldn't be able to do it.
5003.26,"I mean, if the fate of"
civilization,"depended on it,"
5005.96,none of our listeners
would,be able to do this.
5010.46,"And yet, some percentage of them"
are,so distracted by thought
5016.22,that they will actually
try,this experiment
5018.98,and think they succeeded.
5020.022,Right?
5020.522,"And for these people,"
what,happens is
5022.07,you put them on a
meditation,"retreat,"
5024.02,and you have them
spend,12 hours a day
5026.36,"in silence, doing"
nothing,but this.
5028.04,Right?
5028.54,So the practice is just
pay,attention to the breath
5031.04,"when they're sitting,"
and,"then eventually, you"
5033.05,incorporate everything--
sounds,and other sensations.
5035.33,And then you interleave that
with,"walking meditation, where"
5037.893,they're paying attention just
to,the sensations of lifting
5040.31,and moving and
placing,their feet.
5041.96,And then once the
practice,"is going,"
5044.24,you incorporate sounds
and,sights and everything.
5046.76,So you can pay
attention,"to everything,"
5048.385,"but the goal is,"
for,"every moment,"
5052.81,you are going to cultivate
this,"faculty of mind,"
5056.47,which increasingly is
known,as mindfulness.
5059.09,Right?
5059.59,And mindfulness is nothing
other,than this very careful
5063.34,attention to the contents
of,consciousness.
5066.49,But the crucial
piece,is it is not
5071.11,a moment of being
lost,in thought.
5072.83,Right?
5073.33,You're not blocking thoughts.
5075.55,Thoughts themselves can arise.
5076.93,But in those moments
of,"being truly mindful,"
5079.21,you're noticing
thoughts,as thoughts.
5081.43,Whether it's language
in,"the mind or images,"
5084.28,"you're noticing those, too,"
as,spontaneous appearances
5087.49,in consciousness.
5089.74,"So if most people-- you know,"
certainly,anyone who thinks
5095.46,they can pay attention to--
5097.83,who can do the experiment
successfully,that I just
5100.86,suggested-- pay attention
to,something for 30 seconds
5103.23,without being lost in thought--
5105.06,you put those people on a
meditation,"retreat, what"
5107.94,they're going to experience
"is,","you know, on the first day,"
5111.33,they're going to
"feel,","like, oh, yeah."
5113.07,"I was with the breath, or"
I,"was walking-- you know,"
5114.75,I was with the
sensations,of walking--
5116.49,"and I'd be there for, like,"
five,"minutes solid, and then"
5119.353,I would get lost in thought.
5120.52,And then I'd come back.
5121.44,"And then five more minutes,"
I'd,"be lost in thought,"
5123.15,and then get back.
5123.93,But as the days progressed--
5126.78,"even, you know, 10 days in to"
a,silent meditation retreat--
5130.11,they're going to experience
more,and more distraction.
5134.19,It's going to seem
"like,","OK, wait a minute."
5136.83,Now I can't pay
attention,to anything
5139.08,for more than 5 seconds.
5140.94,Right?
5141.81,"That is progress, right?"
5143.31,Because what they're discovering
is,just how distractible
5147.06,they are.
5147.6,Right?
5148.1,"And you know, for"
some,"people, that"
5151.593,will be immediately obvious.
5152.76,"For some people, it'll"
actually,take a lot of practice
5155.22,to realize just how
distracted,they are.
5157.523,ANDREW HUBERMAN: What you
just,"said, which was that,"
5159.69,"at some point, we can start"
noticing,our thoughts--
5167.05,I can notice my thoughts--
but,"what you're talking about,"
5169.72,"as a goal state, is not"
being,"distracted by thoughts,"
5174.76,but actually seeing
the,relationship
5176.26,"between thoughts, self, and"
other,types of perceptions.
5179.11,"And here, I think recognizing"
and,seeing thoughts
5182.71,is a form of perception.
5184.0,It's just an
internally-directed,perception.
5187.42,This raises a topic that
I'm,"also obsessed by,"
5192.25,which I think neuroscience
can,"somewhat explain,"
5194.62,but still incompletely--
5198.16,that the circuits and
"mechanics,","et cetera,"
5200.65,are not yet known-- which
is,about time perception.
5204.61,"And you know, a"
simple,analogy would
5209.65,be that there are a lot of
small,objects flying around
5213.545,in the space that we happen
to,"be having this discussion,"
5215.92,but they're moving so fast
that,I can't perceive them.
5218.44,"Or they're entirely stationary,"
so,I can't perceive them
5220.93,because of the reasons
we,talked about
5222.513,before in the visual system.
5223.72,My eyes are moving
in,perfect concert
5225.58,with these small
object,"movements,"
5228.52,"and therefore, I"
am,blind to them.
5231.85,SAM HARRIS: Right.
5233.58,ANDREW HUBERMAN: A slight
shift,in time perception--
5237.06,"think of this, perhaps, as"
a,"change in the frame rate,"
5241.0,right?
5241.5,Camera frame rates.
5242.34,"A faster frame rate, you"
can,capture slow motion.
5244.897,"Slower frame rate,"
you're,going to get
5246.48,more of a strobe-type effect if
the,frame rate is low enough.
5249.18,SAM HARRIS: Right.
5249.93,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right?
5252.18,Could it be that our time
perception,"is not one thing,"
5257.42,but we have one rate of
perceiving,time for external
5260.63,objects at a given distance--
which,we know is true--
5263.22,another frame rate for
objects,that are up close-- we
5266.39,"know this to be true, even"
if,those objects are moving
5268.64,"at the exact same speed, right?"
5270.05,"I mean, this would be"
the,"sitting on a train,"
5271.25,the rungs on the fence seem to
be,"going by very, very fast,"
5274.17,but the ones in the distance
seem,to be moving slowly.
5276.45,This is the way the visual
system,and time perception
5279.02,interconnect at some level.
5281.638,You're up on a skyscraper--
the,little ants
5283.43,of cars and people down below.
5286.097,You know they're moving
much,faster than you
5287.93,"perceive them to move, but"
it's,a distance effect.
5290.36,"SAM HARRIS: I mean,"
you,"see a plane,"
5291.86,it's going to be going
300,miles an hour.
5293.3,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.
5293.78,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
5294.02,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And,it's not because
5295.07,of the lack of resolution.
5296.21,The lack of resolution
is,incidental.
5298.94,We know this because in
"animals,","such as hawks,"
5302.18,that have twice the degree
of,"acuity, as far as we know,"
5305.54,they have the same
distance-associated,shifts
5309.35,in time perception.
5310.79,So could it be
that,we are running
5312.44,multiple streams of time
"perception,",multiple cones
5315.89,"of attention, that include cones"
of,"attention to our thoughts,"
5318.89,"and that somehow,"
through,"meditation,"
5320.6,we start to align the frame
rate,for these different streams
5323.69,of attention so that they
all,"fall into the same movie,"
5329.12,if you will--
although,it's not just
5330.62,a movie with visual content.
5332.12,What I'm doing here
is,"clearly, I'm"
5334.1,becoming a lumper
rather,than a spreader.
5335.99,I'm sure this violates certain
rules,of time perception
5338.675,"and neural circuitry,"
but,I'm not sure
5340.85,that it's entirely
"untrue,",either.
5344.06,And does it survive at
"all,",as a possible model
5348.035,for what you're describing?
5349.16,And if the answer
is,"no, I'm perfectly"
5350.743,comfortable with that.
5352.44,"SAM HARRIS: Well, it's dependent"
on,what you mean by meditation.
5359.64,"This is where, sort"
"of,",the particularities
5361.44,of what one is doing
with,one's attention
5363.75,under the frame of
meditation,really
5366.66,"matter, because there are"
ways,"to practice mindfulness,"
5370.83,"in particular, where"
the,frame rate really
5374.04,"does seem to go way, way up."
5375.61,Right?
5376.11,And there's actually been
some,"research done on this,"
5378.69,where you take people before
and,after a three-month silent
5382.38,"meditation retreat, and you"
give,them some kind of visual
5386.07,discrimination task where
they,have to detect--
5390.39,I think they used
a,tachistoscope.
5393.69,Is that the tool for?
5394.913,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I'm,not familiar.
5396.33,SAM HARRIS: Something
that,"presents, you know,"
5398.986,very quick pulses of light.
5400.86,"And in any case, just"
in,"any sensory channel,"
5407.263,I would imagine you can make
finer-grained,discriminations
5409.68,if you're practicing mindfulness
in,"a very specific way, which"
5413.34,is to be making these
fine-grained,discriminations
5416.43,"more and more, and do nothing"
else,"for three months, which"
5420.362,is a way of practicing.
5421.32,So the classic
mindfulness,practice
5425.49,in what's called
Vipassana,meditation
5428.91,is to pay scrupulous attention
to,"seeing, hearing, smelling,"
5434.62,"tasting, touching in a way"
that,breaks everything down
5440.19,into these kind of
microscopic,sensory moments.
5444.27,"So you know, rather than feel"
your,"hands pressing together,"
5450.9,what you're trying to
feel,with your attention
5452.91,and you're feeling
more,and more is
5454.83,all of the sensations of
pressure,and temperature
5458.7,and movement such that
the,feeling of hands
5463.44,completely disappears.
5464.46,You realize that a
hand,"is a concept,"
5466.2,and all you have is this cloud
of,punctate and very brief
5471.66,sensations.
5472.45,And so anything you think you
have,"as a datum of experience,"
5477.87,as you bore into it
with,"your attention,"
5482.21,it resolves into this kind of
diaphanous,cloud of changing
5489.35,sensation.
5489.98,And that can be even something
as,"captivating as, like,"
5495.64,a serious pain in your body.
5497.53,"I mean, you can have could have"
injured,"your neck, you know?"
5500.65,And so you have some
excruciating,pain in your neck.
5503.08,If you just are willing to
pay,"attention to it, you know,"
5505.735,and just pay 100% attention to
"it,",a couple of things happen.
5510.98,One is your resistance
to,"feeling it goes away,"
5514.39,"by definition, because now your"
goal,is to just pay attention
5517.03,to it.
5517.53,And you recognize that so much
of,the suffering associated
5520.93,with the pain was borne of
the,resistance to feeling it.
5524.2,You're bracing against it and
all,"of your thinking about it,"
5527.06,you know?
5527.56,"You're thinking,"
"like,","well, you know,"
5529.143,why did I do this to
"myself,",or should I
5530.92,"see an orthopedist, or how"
long,is this going to last?
5533.59,And maybe I herniated a disk.
5536.65,"Like, all of that self-talk"
is,producing anxiety.
5539.59,And I'm not saying there's never
anything,to think about there.
5542.29,But either you can do something
about,it in the moment or you
5545.54,can't.
5546.04,And so much of our suffering
in,the presence of pain is
5550.36,"the result of resisting it,"
worrying,"about it, thinking--"
5554.05,just all of the--
5555.28,everything we're
doing,"with our minds,"
5556.93,"but just feeling it, right?"
5560.47,So when you just
feel,"it, again, it"
5564.22,breaks apart into this
ever,shifting collection
5570.67,of different sensations.
5572.26,"And it's not one thing, and"
it,never stays the same.
5576.88,So two things happen there.
5578.51,One is there can be a
tremendous,amount of relief that
5581.38,happens there where you can
achieve,"a level of equanimity,"
5585.7,even in the presence of really
unpleasant,physical sensation.
5591.08,And this is true of
mental,sensation as well.
5593.05,As it's true of emotions.
5594.16,The classically
negative,emotions
5596.05,"like anger, depression, or fear."
5599.11,The moment you become
willing,to just feel them
5601.45,in all of their punctate
and,"changeable qualities,"
5608.65,they cease to be what
they,were a moment ago.
5613.15,When you're talking
about,"emotional states,"
5615.91,they cease to map back on
to,you and your self concept
5619.33,as meaningful in the same way.
5620.99,"So that suddenly, the"
anxiety,"you feel, let's say,"
5624.58,before going out on stage to
give,"a talk, a moment ago,"
5630.07,"it had psychological meaning,"
it,"felt like, I'm anxious."
5633.7,How do I get rid of this?
5634.87,Why am I this sort of person?
5636.23,Should I have taken
a,beta blocker?
5638.29,This is the conversation
you're,having with yourself.
5641.275,The moment you just
become,willing to feel it
5643.15,as the pure energy of the
physiology,"of cortisol release,"
5649.2,it ceases to have any meaning.
5652.17,It ceases to be a
problem,"in that moment,"
5654.72,because it's no more--
5656.1,it no more maps onto
the,kind of person
5658.02,you are then a feeling
of,indigestion or a pain
5662.04,in your knee maps onto the
kind,of person you are.
5665.565,"It's just sensation, anyway."
5668.483,Back to the main
point,"here, which"
5669.9,"is that, if you train"
your,attention in this way
5673.47,to notice the particularities
of,sensory experience
5677.97,"and emotional experience,"
you're,looking
5679.83,for the atoms of experience.
5683.57,You get better and better at
that,and certain things happen.
5688.72,But one thing that I
really,do think happens
5692.46,is there's a kind of frame
rate,change in the data stream
5697.89,where you really are just--
you're,"just noticing much,"
5700.3,much more.
5702.9,All of that is a very
interesting,way of training.
5705.51,It's not what I tend
to,recommend now.
5708.06,It's a great
preliminary,practice
5709.95,"for what I do recommend,"
because,it really
5713.94,teaches you the difference
between,being lost in thought
5716.34,"and not, it really teaches"
you,what mindfulness is.
5718.95,But it tends to be done by 99.9%
of,"people in a dualistic way,"
5728.25,"which, again, you're set"
up,"to think, OK, I'm over"
5731.37,here as the locus of attention.
5734.1,And I'm continually getting
distracted,by thought.
5736.65,And the project is to not
do,that anymore and actually
5739.47,pay attention to the breath
and,sounds and sensations.
5744.54,And every time I
get,"lost in thought,"
5746.25,I'm going to go back here.
5747.333,But this whole dance
of,"I'm lost in thought,"
5752.28,now I'm strategically directing
my,"attention again, all of this"
5756.29,seems to ramify
this,sense of self.
5758.54,The of there's one
to,be doing this.
5761.39,There's somebody holding
the,spotlight of attention
5764.18,and getting better
at,coming back
5766.64,to the object of meditation.
5770.0,"Again, it's inevitable"
that,99.9% of people
5773.775,are going to start
there,and stay there
5775.4,for some considerable
period,of time.
5777.45,But the thing I like to do
when,I talk about all of this
5781.91,is undercut the false
assumptions,that are anchoring
5785.54,all of that as
early,"as possible,"
5787.55,"because where, I"
"think,",you want to be
5790.76,is recognizing that there
is,no place from which
5794.75,to aim attention.
5796.22,This whole dualistic setup
of,subject and object
5799.13,is the thing that is
already,not there.
5801.56,And it's not that it's there
and,you meditate it out
5804.8,of existence successfully.
5806.45,It's really not there.
5808.13,And if you learn
how,"to look for it,"
5810.38,you can see that it's not there
and,feel that it's not there.
5813.14,And it no longer
seems,to be there.
5815.36,It's like it's not--
5816.83,"and it becomes like, again,"
like,a bi-stable percept where
5819.785,you looked at it long
enough,"and you thought,"
5821.66,"OK, now I see the vase and"
the,face and I can't unsee it.
5827.74,"And every time I look,"
it's,"there again, right?"
5833.06,So yeah.
5834.17,So to come back
to,the example you
5837.02,gave with your
colleague,at Stanford
5841.68,whose book I know I have.
5842.97,I haven't read it.
5843.87,This is a-- he wrote
a,"book, Projections."
5846.46,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
5847.832,SAM HARRIS: So it's
on,my stack to read.
5849.96,But it's the opposite--
5854.227,what I'm recommending
"is,","essentially,"
5855.81,the opposite end
of,the continuum
5857.4,of the internal
exercise,he was doing.
5860.82,So rather than-- so
he's,doing something
5863.52,"very deliberate and controlled,"
and,he is deliberately
5869.1,thinking in complete
sentences,and commandeering
5874.945,the machinery of thought
and,attention in a way
5879.6,that I would imagine.
5880.62,"I mean, I'd be interested"
to,talk to him about it.
5882.703,"But I would imagine, he really"
feels,like he's doing that.
5887.025,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
He's,an engineer--
5888.675,as you've describe it in
this,"way, it reminds me,"
5892.15,"he's a physician, but"
he's,also an engineer.
5894.9,So it's really about
taking,the raw materials
5897.57,of thought and engineering
something,structured from it.
5900.16,SAM HARRIS: Right.
5900.91,Right.
5901.41,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I haven't
been,in Carl's mind.
5904.032,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
5904.74,But if we got him
talking,"on that,"
5906.207,I'm sure we would get
a,sense of what it is.
5908.04,ANDREW HUBERMAN: We'll do that
conversation,at some point.
5911.25,It's the exact opposite
of,what you're describing.
5912.48,SAM HARRIS: Exact
opposite,would be
5913.938,to recognize that the sense of
control,is a total illusion.
5921.48,Because you don't know what
you're,going to think next.
5924.6,"And even he, in the most"
laborious,"way, I mean,"
5927.84,he could just get as
muscular,as he wants with it.
5932.25,He still doesn't know what
he's,going to think next.
5936.87,Because thoughts simply arise.
5940.14,You can run this
experiment,for yourself.
5942.06,And this connects up to
the,topic of free will
5944.88,which we might want to touch.
5946.23,"But I mean, just think"
of,any category of thing.
5949.89,If I asked you to think
of,the names of cities
5952.89,or of friends you have or of
famous,people you can remember
5958.5,exist or think of
nouns,or anything.
5965.22,And just watch what
comes,percolating
5967.74,into consciousness right now.
5971.906,There are things
you,"can't think of,"
5973.427,there are things you
don't,know the name of.
5975.26,There are languages
you,"don't speak,"
5977.15,there are famous people you've
never,seen or never heard of.
5980.45,So you have no control
over,that part.
5982.16,Like those names
and,faces are not
5984.74,going to suddenly come
streaming,into consciousness.
5988.13,But the totality of
facts,and figures
5991.76,and faces and names
that,"you do know,"
5995.35,only some will come
vying,for inclusion.
5999.4,And there's a sort of--
6002.1,we could make guess
and,we know something
6005.433,about the neurology of this.
6006.6,But you depending
on,what channel
6011.712,you're waiting for
thoughts,"in, I mean,"
6013.38,it's going to be
different,if it's visual
6015.088,or semantic or episodic memory.
6017.84,"I mean, all of these"
things,are different.
6019.59,But wherever you
point,your inner
6022.98,gaze of attention and wait
for,the next face or name.
6028.95,Certain things are going
to,come and certain things
6031.83,aren't going to come.
6032.79,And how you land on one--
6035.67,there'll be this process
if,"you're paying attention,"
6037.96,"you might think, let's say we"
go,"with names of cities, right?"
6042.99,"So you'll think of Paris,"
you'll,"think of London,"
6045.15,"you'll think of Rome,"
you'll,think of Sedona.
6048.48,So these names will come.
6050.44,And if I ask you to
just,"say one, right?"
6053.71,So just--
6054.21,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Minneapolis
is,what came to mind.
6055.77,"For me, it was very"
straightforward.,
6056.83,"It was Minneapolis, the"
famous,person was Joe Strummer
6059.08,and they just like--
6060.09,I can give you reasons why
I,think those came to mind.
6062.88,Recent conversations.
6064.01,SAM HARRIS: OK.
6065.97,So we know a fair bit
about,much of this.
6070.35,"So one, we know that"
your,"reasons, obviously,"
6074.46,could be right or wrong.
6075.46,They're very likely
to,be wrong because we
6077.37,have this confabulatory
storytelling,mechanism even
6080.46,in an intact brain
where,we just--
6083.64,we seem to never
lack,for the reasons
6085.74,why something came
to,"mind, and we"
6087.515,can know we can
manipulate,people
6088.89,in ways that prove that
people,are just reliably
6091.38,wrong and confident.
6092.58,"You know, confidently"
so,about the reasons
6094.742,why they thought of
things,or did things.
6096.45,"But leaving that aside, even"
if,"you're completely accurate,"
6101.715,there are people's
names,who you know
6103.8,and cities names that you
know,that inexplicably just
6108.03,didn't come to mind.
6108.945,And if we ran this
experiment,again and again
6110.82,"and again, they"
wouldn't,come to mind
6112.5,if your brain was in
precisely,the state
6114.3,it was in a moment ago.
6115.725,If we could return
your,brain to the state
6117.57,it was in a moment
"ago,",correcting
6119.61,for all the deterministic
changes,and all
6122.61,the random changes that would
have,"to be corrected for,"
6125.49,it to just get--
all,the synapses
6127.35,and the synaptic weights
and,everything in the state
6130.47,it was in to produce Joe
Strummer,in Minneapolis.
6133.98,"If we rewind that movie, that"
part,"of the movie of your life,"
6137.7,you are going to say Joe
Strummer,in Minneapolis
6140.16,a trillion times in a row.
6141.57,"So this is why, in my view,"
the,notion of free will
6144.6,makes absolutely no sense.
6147.227,And you can add as much
randomness,to that process
6149.31,as you want.
6150.03,It still doesn't get you the
freedom,people think they have.
6153.722,There's another conversation
to,have about why none of that
6156.18,matters and why
things,only get better
6157.83,once you admit to yourself
that,free will is an illusion.
6160.32,"And yes, you can get in"
shape,and you can diet
6162.24,and you can do all the
things,you want to do
6164.073,and you don't have to
think,about free will.
6166.26,"But from a contemplative,"
meditative,"point of view,"
6172.83,the thing to notice is
that,everything is just
6175.59,springing into view.
6177.81,There's no place from
which,you are authoring
6180.54,"your next thought, because"
you,would have to think it
6182.97,before you think it.
6184.29,Like there is just this
fundamental,mystery
6189.09,at our backs that is disgorging
everything,that we experience.
6193.597,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
What,if I'm speaking?
6195.18,So if I'm talking
about,something
6197.22,and I have some command
of,"that information,"
6200.49,I can often sense what I'm
going,to say next and then
6203.25,find myself saying it.
6204.51,"And hopefully, that's what they"
say,and not something else.
6206.968,I certainly said things
I,didn't intend to say
6209.07,or never thought I
would,say in life.
6210.75,But when engaged in
speech,"or action,"
6214.98,it at least gives us
the,"illusion, I think,"
6217.68,that we somehow have more
command,over our thoughts.
6220.455,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6221.64,Well you have a script.
6222.94,"I mean, it's like there are"
things,you know a lot about
6225.51,and you've talked
about,"them a lot,"
6228.21,and you know you
have,the things you
6230.34,want to say about those
things,and the things
6232.38,you don't want to say or
you,wouldn't want to say.
6235.83,And you know you can--
6237.24,it still is a bit of a high wire
"act,",because you can misspeak
6240.0,or you can fail to get
to,the end of a sentence
6241.958,in a grammatically correct way.
6244.26,"And again, all of this--"
"objectively,",this whole process
6247.62,is mysterious to you.
6249.49,You don't know how you follow
the,rules of English grammar.
6253.44,Like your tongue is doing it
somehow,"and when it fails,"
6259.74,"it fails, and you're just"
as,surprised as the next guy
6262.8,that it failed.
6263.58,And you mispronounce
a,"word, and OK, I"
6266.548,don't know what happened there.
6267.84,"But if it keeps happening, I'm"
going,to worry I had a stroke.
6270.82,"And if it stops, I'm not"
going,to worry about it.
6276.31,So it's still
mysterious,even when
6279.15,"you're doing it in a very rote,"
"deliberative,",and repetitive
6285.99,way.
6286.53,But when you're
talking,about something
6289.65,you've talked about a
lot,and you know where
6292.497,"you're going to go, right?"
6296.358,We have many
conversations,"like this,"
6301.02,it is somewhat analogous
to,like a golf swing.
6303.24,"Where it's like, you know"
how,"you want to do it,"
6304.86,it's going to be
all,kinds of errors
6306.0,that are going to creep
into,your execution of it
6308.042,in real time.
6308.98,"But there's like you,"
"basically,",have a pattern.
6311.82,And so you have certain
linguistic,patterns
6314.46,which you're following.
6316.95,"Again, none of this is"
a,"proof of free will,"
6320.58,but I will grant you that
"phenomenologically,",it
6323.16,feels different than just
waiting,for the next thought
6326.01,to come.
6327.09,"But my point is that,"
even,if you are--
6333.23,"I mean, you can trim it down"
to,the simplest possible thing.
6335.73,Like you take two things
you,like to drink.
6341.52,You like coffee
and,you like tea.
6343.78,And you're deciding
which,to have.
6345.42,Both are on offer.
6346.26,You've got two cups
in,front of you.
6348.54,"And the question is,"
here,I've got water
6351.51,"and I've got coffee, which"
am,I going to drink next?
6354.39,"Incredibly, it's as simple"
as,possible decision.
6357.87,And no matter how long I
make,"this decision process,"
6362.37,I could literally sit for
an,hour trying to figure out
6364.62,which to reach for next.
6366.66,And I could have my
reasons,"why, and I"
6368.61,could have all my self talk.
6372.715,There's going to be a
final,change in me that's
6376.09,going to be the proximate
cause,of me deciding one
6378.55,over the other.
6379.54,"And that, no matter"
how,laborious
6382.57,I can make it seem in terms
of,"my reasoning about it,"
6388.66,it is going to be fundamentally
mysterious,as to why I went
6392.8,with one rather than the other.
6394.81,Whatever story I have--
6395.92,because it's like-- it's still
going,to be as mysterious
6399.79,as you thinking of Joe
Strummer,when you absolutely--
6405.7,you know of the existence of
Marilyn,Monroe just as much.
6411.28,And yet she simply
didn't,occur to you.
6413.56,It's fundamentally mysterious.
6415.09,Like there are people who
are,even more famous than Joe
6417.67,Strummer to you.
6420.04,"I mean, I'm sure he may be"
somebody,who you have thought
6423.25,"a lot about, but"
there,are people
6426.49,who like if we could just
inventory,your conscious life
6429.76,going back the last
10,"years, there"
6431.723,are people who you've thought
about,more than Joe Strummer
6434.14,yet they didn't appear.
6436.09,And that is mysterious.
6438.158,"And they could have,"
but,they didn't.
6442.72,What I'm saying is that
this,mystery never gets
6446.32,banished in our experience.
6448.15,Whatever stories.
6449.24,We have to tell about it.
6451.09,"Because if the story is, oh,"
"well,",I went for the water
6454.39,because I think I've been
drinking,too much coffee.
6459.61,I listen to Andrew
Huberman's,podcast
6461.72,and he was talking about
"caffeine,",and I think--
6463.72,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's,"good for us,"
6464.5,but you don't want to overdo it.
6465.44,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6465.67,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
6465.94,SAM HARRIS: OK.
6466.18,"So let's say that is,"
"actually,",the causal chain.
6468.28,"Like, I listen to"
your,"podcast, you"
6469.738,say something
about,"caffeine, now"
6471.46,I'm self conscious
about,my coffee intake.
6474.31,But that's just adding a
couple,of links to the chain.
6478.74,There's still this
fundamental,"mystery of, well,"
6482.18,why did I find that persuasive?
6484.04,And why did I find it persuasive
now,and not five minutes ago
6488.24,when I was drinking the coffee?
6489.86,Like why did I just remember it
"now,",or why was it effective?
6494.07,You only have-- your
experience,in every moment
6499.27,is precisely what it is
and,not one bit more.
6504.22,And this subsumes even moments
of,real resolve and effort
6509.14,and picking yourself
up,by your bootstraps
6511.35,and changing everything.
6512.35,It's like you're on
a,diet and you're
6514.81,tempted to eat chocolate.
6516.46,And you think you're
about,to reach
6518.0,"and say, no, I'm not"
breaking,this diet.
6520.48,This diet is actually
going,to stick.
6522.91,Why did that arise in
that,moment and not
6527.59,at this analogous moment
on,your last diet?
6530.26,And why did it arise now
to,precisely the degree
6533.47,that it did?
6535.03,Why will it be as
effective,as it
6537.85,will be and have the
half-life,that it will
6539.89,have and not 10% more or less.
6543.76,All of those are always
mysterious,to you.
6546.045,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, could"
we,"give, as we did before,"
6549.61,an evolutionary and a
developmental,explanation?
6552.07,An evolutionary
explanation,might
6553.48,be that directed attention
and,action is metabolically
6557.92,demanding.
6558.7,It would be inefficient
or,impossible
6562.33,"for us to be in constant,"
deliberate,action with access
6566.11,to all the relevant information
as,to why we would do anything.
6569.03,"So our ideas, literally,"
spring,to the surface
6573.34,at the last possible
moment,in order
6575.89,to offset the great metabolic
requirements,of having ideas
6581.47,that are related to
goal-directed,action
6583.75,or that goal-directed
action,is expensive.
6585.7,That's one idea.
6586.42,The other idea would
be--,and we know
6588.01,"this as a fact, which is"
"that,","initially, the brain is"
6590.83,fairly crudely wired.
6592.078,That's not true within the
neural,circuits that control
6594.37,"breathing, heart"
"rate,","et cetera,"
6596.17,but within the neural circuits
of,"sensory perception, thought,"
6599.21,et cetera.
6599.71,They're fairly crudely wired.
6601.24,And then across
"development,",there's
6603.73,a progressive pruning
back,and also in parallel
6607.008,"to that, a strengthening"
of,the connections
6608.8,that underlie directed
action,and thought.
6611.59,"And here, I don't mean directed"
as,"in free will, I mean,"
6614.11,just that I can decide
to,imagine an apple
6617.29,and imagine that
"apple,",for instance.
6619.405,SAM HARRIS: Right.
6621.783,But your decision--
6622.575,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There,seems to be
6623.992,some maintenance of the fine
random,wiring in systems.
6628.56,"I mean, we've seen"
this,"even in worms,"
6630.81,"in flies, in so-called lower"
invertebrates,and lower
6635.28,vertebrates.
6635.79,And we see this in humans.
6637.2,And it seems to be that
there's,a lot of background
6640.23,spontaneous activity.
6641.28,"I mean, I've sunk electrodes"
into,"the brains of humans,"
6644.26,"macaques, carnivores, and mice."
6646.26,"And in every case, most of"
what,you hear is called hash
6648.667,and it has nothing
to,do with hashish.
6650.25,Is just [VOCALIZING]
on,the audio monitor
6652.32,which is picking up a
bunch,of action potentials.
6655.26,As you're listening to a
chorus,of action potentials.
6658.63,But it's rare to find a neuron
that,faithfully [VOCALIZING]
6662.07,fires to represent some
sensory,stimulus in the world.
6665.79,And you can arrange that
marriage,experimentally
6669.19,so that you can arrive at those
strong,signal to noise events.
6672.1,But I was always struck
by,how much noise there
6674.38,is in the system all
around,all the time.
6677.05,"And people argue, is the"
noise,"really noise, et cetera?"
6680.772,There's still a lot
of,debate about that.
6682.48,But I can imagine that some
of,the spontaneous nature
6685.87,of thoughts just
relates,to the fact
6687.37,that there's a lot of
background,spontaneous activity
6689.32,in the brain.
6690.11,"Now, why that is a"
whole,other discussion.
6692.48,But if I were to set up two
constraints,that there's
6695.29,a lot of spontaneous
"activity,",it's
6696.97,going to generate
random,thoughts.
6699.27,"Thankfully, not"
much,"random action,"
6700.77,although there's a little bit
of,random action in our daily
6703.52,lives.
6704.02,"And then against that say,"
"well,",any deliberate thought
6707.28,or motion is going
to,be expensive.
6711.18,It's a metabolically
expensive,organ to begin with.
6713.68,And so you just have to--
6715.08,evolution has arrived at a place
where,spontaneous geysering up
6720.09,of things upon which like
deliberate,thoughts and action
6724.47,are superimposed is
the,best arrangement
6727.5,overall for this very
metabolically,demanding organ.
6730.687,"I mean, what I"
basically,gave was just
6732.27,kind of a biological description
of,just one narrow aspect
6736.06,of it.
6736.56,But can we get
comfortable,with that?
6738.76,And the reason I say get
comfortable,is that I'm--
6741.48,"and here, admittedly,"
I'm,forcing a little bit
6743.43,of a striptease
towards,what I think I
6745.14,and everyone else wants to
"know,",which is how to meditate
6747.515,"and why, in particular,"
meditation,convinces us
6750.75,that something
doesn't,necessarily
6752.485,"have to be eliminated, but"
that,was actually never there.
6754.86,I feel like we've now set
up,a sort of almost like a--
6759.84,you're not contradicting
yourself,"by any means,"
6761.82,"but in my mind, there's"
a,contradiction.
6763.68,And here's the contradiction.
6766.66,I love this statement
that,meditation over time
6770.44,or done properly reveals
to,us that we're actually
6772.84,not trying to make the gap
between,actor and observer
6776.47,go away.
6777.01,It was actually never there.
6778.617,"To me, that's one of the"
more,important statements
6780.7,"that I, perhaps,"
have,ever heard.
6782.14,And it inspires me to go further
down,"this path of meditation,"
6784.78,because I've never
experienced,that.
6786.47,SAM HARRIS: Right.
6787.22,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
"deliberately,","and certainly,"
6789.262,not through meditation.
6790.63,"If I ever experienced it,"
it,was transient enough
6793.69,that I'm intrigued to
experience,it more.
6796.288,"So on the one hand,"
you're,telling me
6797.83,something was never there.
6799.04,And there's a
profound,experience
6800.92,to be heard by anyone that's
willing,to do the work
6803.86,to arrive at that experience
of,the loss of that illusion.
6807.94,"On the other hand, I'm"
hearing,that there's
6811.43,a profound gap that
really,"does exist,"
6814.52,which is that we believe
that,our thoughts are somehow
6820.27,from us.
6821.98,"And indeed, they're from in the"
cranial,"vault someplace, maybe,"
6825.37,in the body a bit as well.
6827.41,But that we over attribute the
degree,to which we are that
6835.54,and that is us in a way that's
"volitional,",that we control.
6839.74,And so once I'm hearing
that,there's something--
6841.885,there's an illusion that we can
eliminate,and on the other hand
6844.51,I'm hearing that there's
an,illusion that we can't
6846.593,"eliminate, and maybe"
these,are unrelated
6848.98,and I'm bridging them in
an,"unimportant way, that"
6852.52,seems only important to me.
6853.78,"But somehow, I can't"
resolve,these two
6856.42,and maybe the thing
to,"do then is, can we"
6859.0,separate them in terms of
a,practice to witness them?
6862.9,That would allow us to
resolve,them separately.
6866.86,SAM HARRIS: Right.
6867.64,So I think I'm
hearing,the problem.
6871.36,There's this-- let me bracket
the,whole free will discussion
6876.04,because it really is the flip
side,of this coin that I'm--
6881.95,the obverse of which is
the,illusion of the self.
6884.77,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So at least--
6886.12,I might be on the right track.
6887.02,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6887.34,Yeah.
6887.54,ANDREW HUBERMAN: They are
the,opposite sides of a coin.
6889.75,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
6890.245,Yeah.
6890.41,ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
6890.545,Great.
6891.045,Because to me they seem
very,different in essence.
6893.385,SAM HARRIS: No.
6894.01,Because what I'm calling
the,sense of self
6896.56,and what I think
most,people feel
6898.51,as their core sense of
self,is this feeling of--
6903.88,"I mean, it's the feeling of"
being,"the locus of attention,"
6907.24,but it's also the feeling of
being,the locus of agency.
6910.21,I can do the next thing.
6912.58,"Like, who's doing this?"
6913.9,Who's reaching for the cup?
6915.04,I am.
6915.61,Right?
6916.11,"I intended this, and"
now,I'm doing the thing.
6919.57,And my conscious intention
is,the proximate cause
6923.17,"of my reaching, right?"
6926.738,And so I'm the author of
my,"thoughts and actions,"
6928.78,essentially.
6930.19,And my specific uses
of,"attention, right?"
6932.98,So I can pay attention to the
"breath,","I get lost in thought,"
6935.95,I come back to the breath.
6937.36,"But on some level, the thoughts"
themselves,are more of my
6944.05,doing something with
almost,authorial intent.
6949.9,"Like I'm thinking like, what the"
hell,is this guy talking about?
6955.82,Who's thinking these thoughts?
6957.07,I am.
6958.87,The person who really
doesn't,get what I'm saying
6960.97,is thinking something like that.
6963.01,What the fuck is this
guy,talking about?
6964.735,I know I'm here.
6966.67,"I'm a self, I'm a"
"body,",I'm a mind.
6970.33,I can reach for things.
6971.5,That these intentional
actions,are
6973.66,different from things
that,happen to me.
6976.48,A voluntary action is different
from,an involuntary one.
6979.63,So having a tremor is
different,from consciously
6982.63,deciding to pick up a glass.
6985.42,"So obviously, everything"
I'm,saying about meditation
6990.43,and the self and
free,will in order
6992.56,to be a sane picture of a
human,mind and of reality
6995.86,has to conserve the
data,of experience
6998.53,"such that, yes,"
I,can acknowledge
7000.33,the difference between a tremor
and,a deliberative voluntary
7004.17,motor action.
7008.706,And the things you
do,volitionally
7010.92,are different not just
psychologically,and
7013.59,"behaviorally, but they just"
have,different implications
7016.41,for like in a court of law.
7017.94,You accidentally hit
someone,with your car
7020.047,or you did it on
"purpose,",that's still
7021.63,a distinction that matters.
7023.84,"Importantly, it tells us a lot"
about,the global properties
7027.75,of your mind such that we
have,a sense of what you're
7030.09,likely to do in the future.
7031.05,If you're someone who
likes,running over people
7033.008,"with your car,"
you're,a psychopath
7034.935,who we need to worry about.
7036.06,If you're is someone
who,"did it by accident,"
7037.893,well then you may be culpable
for,the level of negligence
7042.9,that allow that to happen.
7044.34,But you're a very different
person,and we you differently
7047.43,and we're wise to.
7049.68,"So anyway, we can"
bracket,all of that.
7056.1,"There's this-- I mean,"
there,are some fundamental--
7058.79,there are some false
assumptions,about the underlying
7063.08,"logic of this process, which,"
I,"think, is worth addressing."
7067.49,Is actually-- there was a kind
of,found object in the news
7071.27,that I talk about at one point.
7074.03,I forget where it
is,in Waking Up app.
7076.22,But there was a story that
I,stumbled on the internet.
7080.31,I think it's about
12,or 13 years old.
7082.55,Of a tourist bus in--
7085.088,I think it was in Norway.
7086.13,It was somewhere
in,Northern Europe.
7089.9,And it had about
30,people on it.
7091.47,And one person was
described,as an Asian woman.
7095.36,And they went to a rest stop
and,everyone got off the bus.
7100.86,And shopped and had lunch.
7103.25,And this Asian woman changed her
clothing,for whatever reason.
7107.3,And they all got
back,on the bus.
7109.65,I think the relevance of
it,being an Asian woman
7111.65,is that there were
language,barriers that
7113.9,explain what later happened.
7116.27,So everyone gets
back,"on the bus,"
7117.8,the Asian woman has
changed,her clothing.
7119.93,And the bus is about to leave
but,"then someone notices, hey,"
7122.93,there was an Asian woman who
got,off the bus who isn't--
7125.63,it hasn't come back yet.
7126.89,And they tell the driver this.
7129.53,And this poses a problem.
7131.093,So now everyone's waiting
for,this person to return.
7133.26,"But in fact, everyone"
was,on the bus.
7134.942,This woman had just
changed,"her clothing,"
7136.65,and was not recognized
by,her fellow travelers.
7140.51,So everyone gets concerned as
this,tourist doesn't show up.
7146.39,And they start looking for her.
7149.45,And they can't find her.
7150.78,And so a search party is formed.
7152.36,"And the Asian woman, because"
of,"whatever language barrier,"
7158.295,heard that there was
a,"missing tourist,"
7159.92,so she joins the
search,"party, which,"
7162.05,"in fact, is looking for her."
7163.97,And this goes on into the night.
7165.77,And they're readying
helicopters,for a dawn patrol
7169.28,to find the missing tourist.
7171.68,"Now, at some point"
along,"the way,"
7173.37,I think it was at like
3:00,"in the morning,"
7175.34,this tourist realizes that she
is,the object of this search.
7181.07,"And obviously, the"
whole,thing unravels.
7184.07,She confesses that she changed
her,clothes and the problem
7187.88,is solved.
7188.64,But the problem is not
solved,by the logic
7193.61,that the seeker is expected.
7195.84,"So it's like, it's"
not,true to say
7198.53,that the missing
tourist,was found
7201.35,in the way that was expected.
7202.882,Because a missing
tourist,was never lost.
7204.59,The missing tourist was
part,of the search party.
7207.847,So when you think about
it,"from her point of view,"
7209.93,"like what happened, she's"
part,of the search party.
7212.81,She's looking for the
missing,tourist not knowing
7216.2,"that she, in fact, is"
the,missing tourist.
7218.99,So what happens at the moment
she,realizes that everyone's
7225.47,looking for her?
7228.942,The search isn't
consummated,in the way
7232.37,that is implied by the logic
of,everyone's use of attention.
7236.21,And yet the problem evaporates.
7238.85,And there's something
deeply,analogous
7242.3,about the structure of that
and,the meditative journey.
7248.03,"Precisely in, again, not talking"
about,all the possible changes
7252.283,in the contents of consciousness
that,"could be good,"
7254.45,"which, again, they"
come,along for the ride
7257.0,anyway when you do the
thing,I'm talking about.
7261.48,It's on this point of
looking,for the self
7263.97,and not finding it.
7265.06,And there is this sense
"that,","OK, the self is here,"
7270.33,and it's a problem.
7271.29,It is the string upon which
all,"of my conscious states,"
7275.43,"mostly unhappy ones, are strong."
7277.85,It's the thing that is at
the,center of my anxiety.
7282.177,It's the thing that I
don't,feel good about.
7284.01,It's the thing that when
"criticized,",I let implode.
7289.62,It's the center of my
"problem,",and now I'm
7291.553,trying to feel better.
7292.47,And meditation has
been,handed to me
7294.57,as a possible remedy
for,my situation.
7299.19,And it's billed as a remedy.
7300.63,"And in fact, I'm"
hearing,from this guy
7303.48,that this is the thing that is
going,to cause me to realize
7306.75,that my self isn't where--
7309.0,or as I thought it was.
7311.59,So now I'm going to look.
7313.02,"And so again, the"
sense,"is, I start out"
7319.36,far away from the goal here.
7320.8,I start out with a problem.
7322.78,I'm now meditating on the
evidence,of my enlightenment.
7326.17,I can feel my problem.
7327.61,I feel that I'm distracted
and,distractible.
7330.13,And I feel as this sort
of,cramp at the center
7333.04,"of my life, that's me."
7334.69,And I'm not as happy as
I,"want to be, I'm not"
7336.61,as confident as I want to be.
7337.975,I'm more distractible
than,I want to be.
7339.77,"And now, I'm paying"
attention,to the breath.
7344.52,This is what the search
party,feels like.
7346.59,This is what the
confused,tourist feels
7349.56,like in her own search party.
7351.15,And she's looking for
the,missing person.
7356.67,So the angle of--
7358.71,the inclination of
all,of this is--
7361.8,and the logic of it is all
"wrong,","understandably so,"
7367.44,given how we all get
into,this situation.
7370.29,But it's useful
to,continually try
7373.93,to undercut it and recognize
that,the thing that's
7380.94,being looked for is actually
right,"on the surface, which"
7384.78,"is, there is no one looking."
7387.06,There is no place
from,which you are--
7389.58,if you're paying attention
to,the breath or to sounds
7392.64,or noticing the
next,"thought arise,"
7395.67,this sense that you
are,over here doing
7399.12,that thing is actually what
it's,like to be thinking
7403.13,and not knowing that
you're,thinking.
7405.793,There's an
undercurrent,of thought
7407.21,that's going uninspected
in,that moment.
7409.53,And so there is just--
7412.5,there's a continually
looking,"for the mind,"
7415.31,looking for the
center,"of experience,"
7417.07,looking for the one who is
"looking,","which, again, which"
7419.93,is the orienting practice here.
7423.23,And there's a lot more I
say,"about this, obviously,"
7426.71,over waking up.
7428.09,But it's the experiment you
have,to perform in order
7432.81,to get ready to recognize that
the,search party was formed
7438.975,"in error, essentially."
7440.37,And the problem
that,you're trying
7443.61,to solve with this
practice,does evaporate
7447.6,"in a similar way, which is"
"like,",you don't actually
7450.93,get there in the way
that,you're hoping for.
7455.52,It's like you drop out
the,bottom of this thing
7457.89,in an unexpected way.
7460.68,There's actually another
similar,parable or anecdote
7466.2,that I don't remember
if,it's Zen or Sufi or--
7468.3,"I mean, I'm sure it's"
been,re-appropriated
7470.05,in many different ways or by
many,different traditions.
7473.19,But the case of somebody who's
lost,in a town and they're
7478.08,asking for directions and you
can,put this in Manhattan.
7482.252,"Let's say, you're wandering"
Manhattan,"and you're a tourist,"
7484.71,you don't know
where,anything is.
7486.085,"And you stop and ask someone,"
where,is Central Park?
7489.69,And the person thinks for a
second,"and they says, oh, yeah."
7492.18,"Unfortunately, you can't get"
to,Central Park from here.
7496.02,"Now, that is a very strange--"
7498.15,"I mean, you think about"
that,for a second.
7499.9,"You realize, OK,"
that's,an absurd.
7504.09,There is no place that you can't
get,to from the place you're
7506.97,starting on Earth.
7508.717,ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
failure,to describe
7510.3,the physical relationships
between,anything in the world.
7513.072,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
7513.78,That's just not the
world,we live in.
7515.52,So but it's a funny thing.
7517.48,But on some level that
is,true of meditation.
7522.0,It's like you can't
get,there from here.
7525.66,The sense of view as
subject,isn't brought along
7529.68,to this thing
you're,looking for.
7535.75,It's almost like
you're,making a fist
7538.23,and you're trying to
get,to an open hand.
7543.03,The fist doesn't get to
take,that journey as a fist.
7548.7,The fist doesn't go
along,for the ride.
7550.39,The fist comes apart.
7553.35,"And on some level,"
the,subjectivity
7555.9,is an attentional fist.
7560.805,It is a contraction of energy.
7563.19,"Again, it's so much bound up"
and,"thought for most of us,"
7568.56,most of the time.
7569.93,And when properly
"inspected,",there's
7573.44,just this evaporation
of,the starting point.
7577.07,But there's not this fulfillment
"of,",I'm going to get--
7580.82,this fixed is just going to--
7584.27,"if life gets good enough, if"
I,"get concentrated enough,"
7586.85,"focused enough, if"
I,"austere enough,"
7590.21,"if I renounce enough,"
if,"I desire less, if I--"
7594.74,with enough good
"intentions,",this fist
7597.83,is going to move into some
sort,of sublime condition.
7601.01,That's not the logic
of,the process.
7605.12,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I really
appreciate,these models
7608.76,and analogies for
conscious,experience
7610.65,both as most people experience
them,and harbor them
7614.19,and as a way to frame
what's,possible through
7618.0,a proper meditation practice.
7620.26,I do want to talk about
what,a proper meditation
7622.26,practice looks like a bit.
7625.21,"But at some point, I do want to"
raise,"a model of, maybe, even"
7631.11,just perceptual awareness to
see,if it survives the filters
7635.31,that you've provided.
7638.25,"But first, briefly, and"
then,we can return to it.
7643.44,What does this meditation
practice,or set of practices
7647.52,look like?
7648.09,"Obviously, the app"
is,a wonderful tool.
7650.58,I've started using it.
7651.54,As I mentioned at the
"beginning,",my father's
7653.43,been using it for a
while,and many people
7655.41,have derived great
benefit,from it.
7657.25,But if we were to break
it,"down, meditation"
7661.26,into some basic component
parts,as we have broken down
7667.26,normal perceptual experience in
some,of its component parts--
7670.425,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
7671.645,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I can
just,throw out some things
7673.77,that I associate
with,"meditation,"
7675.45,and maybe you can elaborate
on,how these may or may not
7678.42,be applied.
7679.0,"For instance, there"
is,almost always
7683.25,a ceasing of robust
motor,movement.
7687.54,I know they're walking
meditations,and so forth.
7689.62,But it seems like sitting or
lying,"down and, perhaps, not"
7693.27,always but often limiting
our,"visual perception,"
7696.87,closing the eyes.
7697.695,SAM HARRIS: Right.
7698.65,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Directing
a,mind's eye someplace.
7702.69,Is there a dedicated effort
toward,generating imagery?
7707.01,What are the component parts?
7708.48,And where I'm really going
with,"this is, why would those"
7711.09,"component parts, eventually,"
allow,for this dissolution
7714.42,of the fist or the
realization,that there
7717.63,is no distinction between
actor,and observer and so on.
7721.572,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
7722.28,Yeah.
7722.78,"Well, so to answer the second"
question,"first, ultimately,"
7726.0,meditation is not a
practice,that you're
7730.26,adding to your life.
7732.36,It's not a doing
more,of anything.
7733.86,It's actually ceasing
to,do something.
7735.81,It's ultimately non-distraction.
7738.78,"I mean, ultimately, you're"
recognizing,what consciousness
7741.42,is like when you're
no,longer distracted
7743.64,by the automatic
arising,of thought.
7747.293,It's not the
thoughts,"don't arise,"
7748.71,it's not that you
can't,"use them,"
7750.085,it's not that you become
irrational,"or unintelligent,"
7755.43,"I mean, all of that-- you"
still,"have all of your tools,"
7757.95,but everything is in plain view.
7761.93,"I mean, there's an analogy in"
Tibetan,"Buddhism which I love,"
7764.6,which is you're kind of in
the,"final stage of meditation,"
7770.02,thoughts are like thieves
entering,an empty house.
7772.99,There's nothing
for,them to steal.
7774.91,"So in the usual case,"
thoughts,are-- there really
7778.63,is something in jeopardy.
7780.01,"Every time a thought comes,"
I'm,"not meditating anymore,"
7782.71,"and not only that,"
I,feel terrible
7784.84,because of what I'm thinking
about,most of the time.
7788.86,And so it's totally
understandable,
7792.595,that thoughts seem like a
problem,in the beginning.
7794.72,And for certain
types,"of meditation,"
7796.63,they are explicitly
thought,of as a problem
7799.09,because you're trying
to,focus on one thing
7801.94,to the exclusion of everything
"else,",including thought.
7804.37,And that is what I called the
concentration,practice earlier.
7809.07,And that's a training
that,can be good to do.
7812.76,It becomes a tool that you can
use,for other kinds of insight.
7817.11,But it's a very specific
and,it's kind of brittle
7820.65,skill in the end.
7821.79,"I mean, it's a skill."
7822.898,Just like I'm going to
pay,attention to one thing
7824.94,and I'm going to do that so
well,that everything else is
7827.4,going to fade out.
7828.655,And it's somewhat
analogous,to what you
7830.28,described in the visual system.
7832.62,If have a laser focus
to,"one fixation point,"
7836.16,everything else in your visual
field,begins to fade out.
7841.43,"But meditatively, if you have"
a,"laser focus on any one thing,"
7845.05,whether it's the breath or a
candle,"flame or whatever it is,"
7850.69,not only does--
7852.04,"I mean, let's use the"
breath,for a second.
7856.712,Because your eyes can be closed.
7860.61,"I mean, you can lose"
all,sense of everything.
7862.832,"I mean, you can lose"
all,sense of hearing
7864.54,and your physical
body,can disappear.
7866.43,"I mean, like, literally, it"
can,become incredibly subtle
7869.28,and vast and drug-like.
7872.28,And many people
approach,meditation
7875.94,thinking climbing the
ladder,of those changes
7879.33,"into subtlety and vastness,"
that's,the whole game.
7883.41,And it can be a deeply
rewarding,game to play.
7887.28,And it also does come with all
kinds,of ancillary benefits.
7890.73,"I mean, all the"
focus,and the calm
7892.515,and the smoothness
of,emotional states.
7895.98,"I mean, all of that comes"
with,greater concentration.
7898.26,And it can be quite wonderful.
7900.96,"But again, at best, that's a"
tool,to aim in the direction
7905.22,that I'm talking about now
with,"respect to meditation,"
7908.89,which relates to more what
I,would call mindfulness
7912.54,generically.
7915.03,"And ultimately,"
non-dual,mindfulness.
7917.91,So mindfulness
generically,and for most
7921.45,"people, certainly"
in,"the beginning,"
7924.08,dualistically is
just,the practice
7927.17,of paying careful attention to
whatever,is arising on its own.
7934.23,"Now in the beginning, it's"
natural,to take a single object
7937.86,like the breath as
a,starting point.
7939.93,It's an anchor.
7942.18,"But very, very quickly, over the"
course,of even your first week
7946.14,"of doing this, teachers and"
various,sources of information
7951.99,will recommend that once you get
some,facilities-- once you know
7955.57,the difference between
being,lost in thought
7957.57,and actually paying attention
to,"the breath, well,"
7960.06,then you can open
it,up to everything.
7961.912,You can open up the sounds
and,other sensations
7963.87,in the body and
moods,and emotions.
7967.35,"And even, ultimately,"
thoughts,themselves.
7971.55,"So very quickly,"
you,can recognize
7973.53,that thoughts are
not,intrinsically
7976.91,the enemy to this practice.
7978.29,They are also just spontaneous
appearances,in consciousness
7981.5,that can be observed.
7983.78,But for some considerable
period,"of time,"
7986.81,people will feel that
there,is a place from which
7989.42,that observation is happening.
7991.22,"There's just, I'm now the"
one,who's being mindful.
7996.2,And however attenuated that
sense,"of self can be, I mean,"
8000.78,"again, it can get"
very,expansive.
8002.76,"I mean, you can lose--"
8005.49,"as you get anything, just"
a,"modicum of concentration,"
8009.57,you know it becomes
very,drug-like
8011.61,and you get the boundaries
of,your body dissolve.
8015.03,And your feeling of having
a,body can disappear.
8018.9,"And you if your eyes are closed,"
you,know your visual field--
8022.543,"I mean, most people, when they"
close,"their eyes initially,"
8024.96,they just forget about
their,visual field.
8026.71,But if you close
your,"eyes right now,"
8028.77,you notice your visual
field,is fully present.
8031.74,"And we call it dark,"
but,it's not quite dark.
8035.67,There is a sort of scintillating
some,field of color and shadow
8042.84,that's there in the darkness
of,your closed eyes.
8045.57,And that can become
a,sky-like domain
8050.1,of vast visual
expression,that opens up
8057.18,as you get more concentrated
with,your eyes closed right.
8061.05,So you can very much be aware
of,seeing with your eyes closed
8064.62,in a meditative practice.
8068.33,But from the point of
view,"of mindfulness,"
8071.77,the logic is not to care about
any,of the interesting changes
8076.57,and experience that come
as,a result of practicing
8079.54,"in this way, because"
the,underlying goal
8083.19,is to be more and more
equanimous,with changes.
8089.39,So it's not to grasp at
what's,pleasant or interesting
8091.69,and not to push what's
unpleasant,or boring
8096.04,or otherwise not
engaging,in a way.
8100.96,What you want is just a kind
of,a sky-like mind that just
8105.07,allows everything to appear.
8106.51,And you're not
clinging,to anything
8108.6,or reacting to anything.
8111.16,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I ask
you,what your thoughts are
8113.47,about the differences between
"nouns,","adjectives, and verbs"
8119.59,in the context of what
we're,talking about
8121.925,in you're describing?
8122.8,And the reason I bring this
up,"is that as you know,"
8126.94,I know everything in
biology,is a process.
8129.1,We would never ever
"say,","oh, the perception"
8132.85,of that red line on
a,painting is a noun.
8137.77,"I mean, it's an event"
in,the visual system.
8139.87,You're abstracting
some,understanding
8141.91,about that thing in
the,outside world.
8144.02,And I think it's very useful
in,thinking about the brain.
8149.08,People will notice I notice--
8150.34,"I, excuse me, actively avoid"
the,"use of the word mind,"
8153.37,"because I figure, especially,"
with,"sitting across from me,"
8156.25,that I'll step in it if I do.
8159.34,But the brain generates
a,series of perceptions
8164.22,or what have you by through
"processes,",not nouns.
8168.33,And so when thinking about
"biology,",I think of development
8171.29,is an arc of processes.
8173.303,Aging is an arc-- perception
is,an arc of processes.
8175.47,They just exist on
different,time scales.
8177.3,And so a little bit
of,what I'm hearing
8180.21,is that inside of an
effective,"meditation practice,"
8184.03,there's a little bit of
certainly,non-judgment
8187.35,but discarding of the
noun,and the adjective
8191.1,modes of language.
8192.75,Like red apple.
8193.629,OK.
8194.129,"It's a red apple,"
but,then you need
8196.59,to eliminate some other
adjectives,about it.
8198.93,"It's a rotten apple,"
it's,a ripe apple.
8202.049,And instead view the
appearance,and disappearance
8204.87,"of that apple as just a thing, a"
process,as opposed to an event.
8209.86,"And now, events,"
we,could really get
8211.379,into the language aspect of it.
8212.745,That just reveals how
diminished,language
8215.76,is to describe the workings
of,the brain at some level.
8220.73,I don't know if any
of,these resonates.
8222.68,"But it seems to me, the"
goal,or one of the goals
8225.08,is to start to understand
the,algorithm that
8227.959,is the fleeting nature of
perception,but to not focus
8231.41,on any one single perception.
8233.18,And then to not even focused
on,"one single algorithm,"
8235.7,"but to, at some"
"level,",there's a--
8239.12,what is revealed to
the,meditator over time
8241.91,is some sort of
macroscopic,principle
8244.969,about the way perceptions
work,at a deeper level.
8250.129,That there's a deeper principle
there,that sits below our--
8254.78,certainly our normal
everyday,awareness.
8256.95,But that in paying attention to
the,mechanics of all this stuff
8259.67,"and not judging those mechanics,"
not,"naming those mechanics,"
8262.549,or just naming them
and,let them pass by.
8264.53,That there's some
action,"function,"
8266.54,some verb is revealed.
8268.219,And that maybe that
verb--,may be the word
8270.2,to describe that
verb,is mindfulness.
8272.51,Maybe mindfulness is really
just,a verb to describe that.
8276.44,I don't know.
8278.362,Is there anything here?
8279.32,Or am I-- I don't know
if,I'm creating just
8282.53,like useless straw or
if,there's actually
8284.959,a seed here of something real.
8286.35,"But to me, any time I want"
to,understand something
8288.74,"in biology or psychology, I"
try,and broaden the time domain
8292.711,"and think in terms of verbs,"
not,nouns or adjectives.
8294.919,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
8295.7,"Yeah, yeah."
8296.27,No.
8296.99,"That's very useful,"
and,that's somewhat
8299.99,adjacent to this
distinction,I'm making
8301.82,between dualistic and
non-dualistic,ways
8304.52,of experiencing the world.
8306.299,"So even dualistically,"
everything,is still a process.
8309.92,And we're misled
by,the reification
8312.889,that noun talk gives us.
8316.25,And this applies not just to
something,"like mindfulness,"
8318.98,but even to something
like,the self.
8321.08,So the sense of self
is,also a process.
8325.04,"I mean, it's a verb,"
it's,not-- so we're self
8328.219,in more than we are ourselves.
8332.84,And there are-- even appropriate
uses,of the term self
8339.26,that don't go away
even,when you recognize
8342.65,"that the core subject,"
"self,",is an illusion.
8346.669,There are states of self where
you,can recognize in your life
8351.799,that you inhabit very different
modes,of being depending
8356.33,on the context.
8357.15,So like there are
moments,where you--
8359.18,just by walking into
a,"certain building,"
8362.09,you suddenly transition into
a,different state of self.
8364.79,"Like suddenly, you"
pass,through a door
8367.37,and now you are a customer
in,"a store, right?"
8370.16,So we know what that
customer,feeling is.
8372.59,"Like, you're now the person"
who's,getting the attention.
8375.23,It's a very formalized
type,of attention
8377.18,from the person who is running
the,store or a restaurant.
8382.129,You're a customer
at,a restaurant.
8383.99,That's a-- I just remembered
something,that's funny.
8389.03,That was born of a
mismatch,of this.
8391.88,I'll come back to
that,in a second.
8394.91,So there are-- so
we,go through it.
8400.41,You can be a student in
the,"presence of a teacher,"
8402.87,you're going to be a
parent,in the presence
8404.662,"of a son or a daughter,"
you,can be a spouse
8407.538,in the presence of your spouse.
8408.83,And all of those shadings of--
8412.34,like the change in context
really,does usher in some
8420.8,fundamental
psychological,changes
8422.93,in just the states
of,consciousness
8425.12,that are available to you.
8427.49,And some of this is really--
8428.72,"I mean, I'm sure we could"
understand,a lot about this
8432.77,personally and generically.
8435.41,But it is pretty mysterious.
8438.72,"I mean, there are"
people,who I know
8441.43,who I'm with them
in,"a certain way,"
8444.73,and based on something
I'm,"getting off of them,"
8449.74,I can't be that--
8451.57,I'm effortlessly
one,"way with them,"
8454.3,and there's no way I could be
that,way with somebody else.
8458.35,I don't know if it's the
pheromones,"or their facial,"
8461.142,"just the way they are,"
their,facial expression.
8463.1,"But I mean, there are"
people,with whom I'm really
8467.05,kind of effortlessly
"funny,",and there
8469.3,are people with whom
I,couldn't even--
8470.95,it would never occur to me to be
funny,no matter what happened.
8474.28,And I have long
standing,relationships
8476.74,"with these people, so all"
of,that's very mysterious.
8482.14,"But anyway, the"
difference,there is not
8485.41,in this core sense of
subject,in relationship
8489.25,"to all the objects, it's in"
kind,of the states of self.
8494.44,And all of that is very verby.
8496.99,All this is a
pattern,of changes.
8499.43,It's a pattern of
what's,available
8500.98,"and what's not available,"
the,capacities there that
8504.4,come online or not in
those,various contexts.
8508.63,"But no, the memory"
I,"just had, which"
8510.37,I hadn't had in a long time.
8512.92,But it was one of
these,moments where
8514.84,I realized the power of
these,shifts in context
8519.55,for states of self.
8520.84,"So once, I was a young man."
8524.77,I think I was probably
22,"or so, and single."
8531.04,"And like, you're just"
"like,",trying to figure out
8533.38,how do you meet women?
8535.0,And how does one get
confident,to do this well?
8537.88,And I walked into a restaurant
and,a kind of a woman
8546.55,"was walking toward me, toward"
the,front door of the restroom.
8550.84,But she was walking toward me
in,a way where I just by default
8553.45,assumed she was the
hostess,in the restaurant.
8557.41,But she wasn't the
"hostess,",she was just
8561.62,someone who had just
eaten,"there, I guess."
8563.74,"So I walked through,"
and,she comes out.
8565.39,And so there's a fundamental
misunderstanding,in me
8567.88,that's set up by literally just
this,change in architecture.
8571.42,And so I just said
hi,to her in a way
8573.73,that I presumably I would
say,hi to any hostess who
8576.07,was coming up to ask me
where,I wanted to sit.
8579.94,But what had
actually,happened is
8581.65,I had said hi to a
total,stranger in a way
8584.56,that I tended at
that,point never
8586.423,to say hi to total
strangers,because I was shy
8588.34,and it was just like that.
8590.23,"But apparently, I gave her"
like,"a 10,000 watt high"
8594.37,of all of the confidence
you,would have if you
8597.13,were that sort of person.
8598.27,And it just ushered
in,a complete like--
8601.42,so I went to my
"table,","and this woman,"
8603.4,I came back into the restaurant
and,"gave me her phone number,"
8606.61,which was something that
was,just a completely
8608.53,"foreign experience to me,"
and,it was based completely
8612.01,on my misunderstanding of
the,situation I was in.
8615.64,And so anyway--
8618.547,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Among
the,misunderstandings
8620.38,that one can have and then
action,"and engage in life,"
8623.68,I would say that was a
somewhat,adaptive one.
8626.35,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, but"
then,"you realize that, OK,"
8628.54,but then there
are,certain people
8630.16,who recognize this
machinery,to whatever degree
8633.73,or have kind of natural
aptitudes,for bringing
8636.16,certain things online or not
such,that they can consciously
8642.55,"make these states of self,"
this,"level of gregariousness,"
8646.36,"say, available to them"
in,the circumstances
8650.65,where it's is actually
useful,to them.
8652.27,So if you're single and
you,"want to meet people,"
8654.43,"well, it's actually very"
helpful,to feel confident enough
8658.6,to just go say hi to strangers
and,ask them how they're doing
8661.33,and to be online in that way.
8665.98,Where at that point in my
"life,","in that circumstance,"
8670.785,"by default, I was"
going,to ignore
8672.16,this stranger who I was
passing,by in the doorway
8674.68,of a restaurant.
8675.59,But thinking she
was,"the hostess,"
8677.53,I was engaging her fully.
8680.71,"So anyway, you can"
consciously--,"again,"
8682.81,this does not invoke
free,will at all.
8684.55,"But yes, you can"
consciously,decide
8686.2,to play with these
mechanisms,such
8688.3,that you can decide
what,states of self
8693.61,would be more normative to have
given,what you want in life.
8697.0,And you can become increasingly
attentive,to the ways in which
8701.56,you get played by the world.
8703.543,You're a kind of instrument.
8704.71,Your mind is a
kind,of instrument.
8706.127,Your brain is a kind of
instrument,that is continually
8709.0,getting played by the
situations,"you are in,"
8712.51,and you can become more
of,an intelligent curator
8716.23,of your conscious states and
your,conscious capacities
8719.36,just by noticing
the,changes in you.
8721.12,"Like, in graduate school,"
it's,something I talk about.
8724.42,I think at some
point,"in waking up,"
8727.07,this became very stark for me
because,I was an old graduate
8732.96,student.
8733.46,I had taken 11 years off at
Stanford,between my sophomore
8737.12,and junior year.
8737.96,So when I went back to school--
8739.752,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Talk
about,a leave of absence.
8741.71,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, but I"
"mean,","Stanford had this,"
8743.75,you might know this.
8745.653,They have this stop out policy
where,you never really drop
8748.07,"out, you just stop as you want."
8749.362,You can always go back.
8750.41,You don't have to
write,letters saying
8751.993,that you still exist
every,two years as you
8754.22,do in other schools.
8755.15,"So anyway, I showed"
up,after 11 years.
8760.1,"So I was really on a deadline,"
and,I felt late for everything.
8763.37,So I'm kind of
finishing,my degree
8765.44,as quickly as I can
as,"an undergraduate,"
8767.498,and then I jump into
graduate,"school,"
8769.04,and I'm an old graduate student.
8772.724,There's a real sense of urgency.
8774.62,"Like, I'm late."
8775.38,I should have done this earlier.
8776.713,I want to get this stuff done.
8778.37,But then 9/11 happened.
8781.19,And just as I had finished
my,"coursework getting my PhD,"
8786.47,and I was just getting
into,my research but 9/11
8790.16,intersected with my
life,in such a way
8791.777,that I just had to drop
everything,and write
8793.61,my first book.
8794.52,And I did that.
8795.21,And then I just had to
drop,everything and write
8797.21,my second book because of the
response,to the first book.
8799.64,"And so essentially, I"
had,"like, four years,"
8801.89,where I was AWOL doing my PhD.
8805.52,But I still had a toe in
the,lab and I was still
8807.77,showing up occasionally.
8808.79,But I was becoming this
kind,of cautionary tale
8811.1,from the point of
view,"of grad school,"
8812.78,but I was also becoming kind of
a,famous or semi-famous writer
8817.16,because my first book had been
a,"New York Times best seller,"
8821.24,so I was getting some
notoriety,as a writer.
8824.71,And so I was doing things
"like,",I was giving a Ted Talk
8827.127,but I still hadn't
finished,graduate school.
8828.96,So it was I think that
timing's,"is right, maybe"
8832.363,I had just finished
graduate,school when
8834.03,I gave the Ted Talk.
8834.87,"But anyway, so I was"
rowing,in two boats
8839.01,and one boat was
sinking,or showing
8841.23,every sign of being damaged.
8843.48,And I was literally
"like,",getting letters
8845.91,from the head of the
department,"saying,"
8847.635,we're concerned about you.
8848.91,"But on the other hand, I was"
becoming,a quasi celebrity
8854.07,"in that world too, at least in"
a,world that was overlapping.
8858.54,So I was having the experience
of,going in the moment where
8863.31,this crystallized for me
in,a fairly peculiar way
8867.96,"was, I had a meeting"
at,like 3:00 o'clock
8870.48,with my advisor who
was,"just this guy,"
8872.91,"Mark Cohen, in the brain"
mapping,center at UCLA who's
8875.76,a fantastic guy.
8878.31,Great advisor.
8879.39,I did not extract as much wisdom
from,him as I should have.
8883.59,Brilliant scientist.
8884.7,"And for him, I'm late."
8889.38,"At least, in my head--"
8890.31,he is not that he was riding
me,"so hard but in my head,"
8892.65,I'm very self
conscious,about how
8894.45,I'm not living up to his
expectations,at this point.
8899.11,So I have a meeting with
him,"at 3:00 o'clock,"
8901.11,and I'm just kind of
wilting,under his gaze
8905.97,and my own imagined
inner,gaze of his.
8911.36,"But two hours later,"
I,have a meeting
8914.43,"with his boss, a dinner"
meeting,with his boss
8917.73,who wants to meet with me to get
advice,on launching his book.
8921.383,We have the same
publisher,but I'm
8922.8,"like, the much bigger"
author,"at Norton,"
8926.325,and he's coming
to,me for advice.
8930.12,And so I'm ricocheting between
two,diametrically opposite self
8935.52,"states that are-- again, this"
comes,down to architecture.
8938.412,It's literally like
the,state I was
8939.87,in walking into one building
and,then leaving and walking
8942.54,into another building
on,the same campus.
8946.71,And they were completely
opposite,self concepts.
8952.2,"Like, in one context,"
I,am a fuckup.
8957.0,"In another context,"
I'm,a celebrity.
8959.52,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you
have,"mastery and virtuosity,"
8962.37,and we're developing
it,very quickly.
8964.59,SAM HARRIS: But so
"again,",this is a kind
8966.93,of a stark version of that.
8968.44,But everyone has
some,version of this
8971.04,just in bouncing between
talking,to their mom
8974.61,and then talking to
their,best friend
8976.29,and then talking to a stranger
and,talking to someone who's
8980.052,"very successful,"
talking,to someone
8981.51,who's not very successful.
8983.01,You notice your vulnerability
to,all of this stuff.
8985.86,"And ultimately, what"
you,want is a level
8991.54,of psychological integrity that
is,truly divorceable from that.
8996.76,"Now, I'm not I'm not"
saying,you're ever
8999.07,"going to get it perfect, there's"
always,going to be some--
9003.62,"I mean, I can't talk about"
the,ultimate fulfillment
9007.64,of this process.
9009.41,"I'm not a Buddha, I'm not saying"
I've,finished the project.
9012.86,But I think there's more and
more,as you become sensitive
9020.81,to these changes and you become
sensitive,to what it's like
9023.48,to actually not be
psychologically,reactive
9027.32,and not be definable by your
own,"self-concept, your own--"
9032.708,you're not identifying
with,"anything,"
9034.25,you're not hanging
your,"hat on anything,"
9035.917,you're not thinking about
yourself,in the kind of terms
9042.41,that you would export
to,others and then
9044.57,care about what they
think,about you.
9047.33,There's a kind of
invulnerability,
9050.9,that arises that's not borne
of,"being well defended,"
9057.18,it's born of being evaporated.
9060.11,"It's like, you're no longer"
keeping,score in those ways.
9063.185,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Once
"again,",I really appreciate
9065.81,that description
because,"these days,"
9068.09,I'm really intrigued
by,something
9070.85,we've known for a long
time,that you're certainly
9073.4,familiar with is the prefrontal
cortex's,ability to establish
9076.73,context dependent rule sets.
9078.38,A Stroop task would
be,basic example
9080.96,of reading numbers
or,letters on cards
9083.6,and then switching
to,having to report
9085.19,the colors that the letters
and,numbers are written in.
9087.23,It's a basic task.
9088.19,"But prefrontal cortex,"
obviously,important for setting
9091.64,context dependent thought and
behavior,and directed action.
9095.0,But within the context of all
these,different variations
9098.66,"of the self, depending on"
graduate,school or relationship
9104.42,where sitting alone
in,"one's room,"
9106.36,there are different
rule,sets arise
9108.1,"and somehow, we are able to have"
a,coherent sense of self that
9112.09,encompasses all of those.
9113.92,Functional people can toggle
between,them as needed and not
9118.33,overlap them inappropriately.
9119.77,At least not to the
extent,that it's
9121.66,career failing or life failing.
9123.31,Although there are sad
examples,"of that, many of which"
9128.2,exist in the Twitter space.
9130.63,"I know several colleagues,"
not,"directly of mine,"
9133.84,but people who threw mistakes
made,"with their thumbs,"
9137.14,where they forgot
context,or forgot
9140.89,to realize that the context on
social,media is near infinite.
9145.0,But the context that
existed,in their head
9146.77,might not be clear in the
way,that they communicated
9149.26,"something, and they"
lost,their jobs
9151.48,by saying what were perceived
as,insensitive things.
9154.27,"In some cases were, in fact,"
"offensive,",insensitive things.
9157.45,"In some cases, it's debatable."
9160.97,"In any case, I think that the"
image,that now comes to mind
9165.23,relates to something you've said
several,"times, that it's not"
9168.44,about eliminating
"something,",it's
9170.0,about revealing that something
was,never actually there.
9173.055,And then in terms of
sensory,experience
9174.68,and these different
aspects,"of the self,"
9176.57,I have this image
in,my mind of--
9178.97,I'm not an experienced
scuba,"diver,"
9180.65,but I've done enough of it.
9181.84,I've worn a wetsuit.
9182.87,You wear a complete
wetsuit,with the hood.
9184.67,And this idea if you were
born,"into that wetsuit,"
9188.54,"you might think that yeah,"
you,nudge up or lean up
9192.47,against a wall and you
experience,it one way.
9196.73,But were you to
shed,"that wetsuit,"
9198.68,"you go, wow, there's"
this,incredible landscape
9201.14,of somatosensory experience
that,I had no idea.
9204.71,It goes way beyond
levels,of sensitivity.
9206.66,Right now you're talking about
fine,two point discrimination
9209.16,"and light strokes,"
and,this could
9210.59,be positive or negative
pain,in other ways too.
9213.23,But what you're
describing,is essentially
9215.12,that the wetsuit was
never,"really there,"
9217.88,but was created through
a,series of action steps.
9221.9,And I think what we're
migrating,towards here
9224.3,"is a set of for most,"
non-intuitive,or non-reflexive
9231.2,action steps that reveal
to,"us that in fact, we're"
9235.25,not wearing the wetsuit.
9236.72,"Now, you raised one"
"topic,",which I think
9240.542,is analogous to
this,"wetsuit, which"
9242.0,is this notion of distraction.
9243.47,"That normally, distraction is"
masking,what would otherwise
9246.11,be a better experience of life.
9251.65,I can think of
distraction,as falling
9254.05,into two different bins.
9255.4,One would be the
kind,of distraction
9257.38,that is internally generated.
9259.06,"Like, the fact that"
thoughts,arise and pull me
9261.46,down different alleyways
and,avenues of my brain
9265.06,and my thoughts
and,my experience.
9269.26,And that would compete
with,my ability
9272.02,to really focus on something.
9274.83,And then another
form,of distraction
9276.84,which captures my ability
to,focus intensely
9280.62,but has me focusing
on,the wrong things.
9283.17,"And here, I think"
the,judgment of wrong
9286.08,is reasonable to include
"if,","for instance, I'm"
9289.65,being impulsively yanked to
something,on social media.
9294.6,I'm being impulsively yanked
to,someone else's pain
9296.85,and experience and
somehow,confusing
9298.62,that with my own experience.
9300.12,This isn't empathy but
just,being yanked around.
9302.29,My attention as a spotlight
is,kind of like over
9304.29,"here, over there."
9305.16,I'm not feeling
as,if I'm the one
9306.945,standing behind that
spotlight,controlling it
9308.82,"or I'm not the spotlight,"
just,to keep with what
9311.913,we've been building up here.
9313.08,So could you tell us a
little,bit about distraction
9316.8,and tell me whether
or,not these two
9320.08,forms are in any way
accurate,or inaccurate?
9323.17,I'd be happy for them
to,be inaccurate.
9324.868,And whether or not there are
other,forms of distraction
9327.16,that we need to be
on,the lookout for.
9328.85,"And again, I think"
what,most people
9331.21,"are seeking is, what is the way"
to,not just enhance our ability
9334.48,to focus but to shed this
wetsuit-like,cloak that limits
9338.8,our experience that I'm
calling,and that you've
9341.14,called distraction?
9342.685,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, distraction"
is,one component of it.
9347.99,The other aspect of it is
identification,with thought.
9351.64,And the feeling of self
is,bound up in the sense
9355.33,"that I'm the thinker,"
I'm,"the one attending,"
9359.03,I'm the one vulnerable.
9360.61,I'm the inner homunculus that's
vulnerable,to experience.
9365.66,And it can be
gratified,"by it or not,"
9367.96,and it's constantly trying
to,improve it or mitigate
9371.32,negative aspects of it.
9373.945,It's the sense that
there's,kind of a rider
9376.163,on the horse of
consciousness,as opposed
9377.83,to just consciousness
and,its contents.
9380.42,"So again, it rides atop this"
illusion,"of control, et cetera."
9386.6,So to go all the way back to the
question,"you asked about, just"
9391.72,"what is in it, what I"
recommend,as a starting point
9395.11,for meditation.
9398.797,Some of your assumptions
"are,","in fact, true."
9400.63,"Yes, I often recommend"
at,the beginning people
9403.51,close their eyes and you
do,a sitting practice
9406.42,and it's different from
a,walk in practice.
9408.5,"I mean, you can do"
"both,",but people
9409.958,tend to start sitting
with,their eyes closed.
9413.2,"But again, ultimately"
where,this is going
9415.87,is it's not an art
of--,meditation
9419.35,properly recognized is not
an,artifice that you're
9422.05,adding to your life.
9423.37,"It's not even a practice,"
it,is less rather than more.
9428.71,"And therefore, it is also"
coincident,with potentially
9433.63,every waking moment.
9435.7,There's nothing that you
can,do with your attention
9439.52,once you know how to meditate.
9440.77,That in principle
excludes,meditation
9443.65,because meditation
is,just a recognition
9447.58,of an intrinsic character of
consciousness,in each moment.
9450.693,And all you have
in,each moment is
9452.11,"consciousness and its contents,"
whatever,you're doing.
9457.14,"So in the beginning, you'll be"
very,deliberate and precious
9461.55,about deciding to
practice,"meditation,"
9464.032,and you'll set aside 10
minutes,"in the morning,"
9465.99,and you'll do that.
9467.28,And it'll seem very different
from,the next 10 minutes
9469.65,when you're spilling
out,onto your to-do list
9473.31,and you're trying to figure
out,what the day looks like.
9476.28,"But ultimately,"
you,want to erase
9479.28,this boundary between formal
practice,and the rest of life
9481.89,such that it's just
not,remotely findable.
9488.959,And that's achievable.
9490.95,And I think even from
the,"very beginning,"
9492.69,you can relax this conceptual
distinction,between meditation
9495.99,"and its antithesis, because it's"
not,at the level of anything
9500.49,"you're doing, it's at"
the,level of what's
9505.68,happening in your
relationship,to thought.
9507.99,"Like, what can you notice?"
9510.81,It's + transition from
the,by-stable percept.
9516.62,You're looking at the
image,and you see nothing.
9521.5,Let's say it's the
"Dalmatian,",it's
9523.51,just the spots on the paper.
9524.71,And you don't see anything.
9527.15,And then all of a sudden the
Dalmatian,or the face of Jesus
9529.69,or whatever the image is
pops,"out and then you see it,"
9533.83,it's the transition from
nothing,to something.
9536.83,The practice becomes
the,transition
9538.63,from being lost in thought
and,then waking up.
9543.43,And breaking the
spell,"of thought,"
9547.69,and identification of thought
is,very much like waking up
9550.9,from a dream and having--
9554.71,it's like that transition.
9557.23,Like you're having a
dream,and couple of things
9562.645,are true there.
9563.27,"I mean, it's a psychosis"
that,is just not--
9569.03,we don't problematize
because,you're safely in bed
9571.12,and you're not moving
or,unless you've got
9572.87,some kind of sleep disorder.
9575.12,You're not walking
around,harming
9577.01,yourself or anybody else.
9579.23,But to be in bed
and,to not know it
9582.95,and to think you're
running,along a beach
9585.71,or you're getting tried for
murder,in a court of law
9589.04,or whatever the
thing,is that you're
9590.57,completely delusional
"about,",that is psychosis.
9593.78,And it's like
you're,fundamentally
9595.49,unaware of your circumstance.
9596.9,And then two things
can,happen there.
9598.73,You can either become lucid
within,"the dream, which"
9601.73,"is interesting, and there's"
a,whole phenomenology
9604.07,of that which can be practiced.
9607.22,"But more commonly,"
you,can just wake up
9609.53,from the dream and
all,"of a sudden,"
9611.51,the problem you thought
you,"had is no longer there,"
9615.48,and you have a completely
different,context
9618.17,for your conscious life.
9619.97,"Now, you know you're safely"
in,bed all the while.
9623.57,There really is
something,analogous
9626.66,when you break this
identification,with thought.
9629.81,You're having a
thought,that seems
9632.09,to be some kind of moral or
psychological,emergency and yet
9645.04,the moment you see
daylight,"around,"
9646.78,the moment you see
that,the mind is larger
9650.08,"than this mere appearance,"
then,suddenly you
9654.91,have a degree of freedom
that,a moment ago was
9657.4,just unthinkable.
9658.57,"And you recognize, you"
sort,"of come to in a way,"
9663.19,you recognize your
circumstance,in a way
9665.117,that you weren't a moment ago
when,you were just talking
9667.45,"to yourself, when you were just"
identical,to that conversation.
9671.48,So this is all to say that
"ultimately,",meditation--
9677.05,"I mean, so again, there's"
another,apparent paradox here.
9679.91,Many people who don't
know,much about meditation
9681.91,will say things
"like,","well, for me,"
9685.5,running is my meditation
or,skiing or rock climbing
9689.16,or playing the guitar
or,something they like
9691.98,to do that gives them an
experience,"of flow, that's"
9696.06,what they go to feel better
and,that's the opposite of all
9699.27,the chaos of their lives
or,their time on Twitter
9703.38,or whatever it is.
9707.17,And virtually every
"case,",it's not
9709.3,true to say that that is
effectively,meditation.
9712.18,By learning to play
the,"guitar, you're"
9713.77,not going to learn what
I'm,calling meditation.
9716.89,And you're not going
to,learn it by cycling
9719.65,and getting-- no matter how good
you,"get at any of those things,"
9722.38,you're not going to learn
it,by doing those things.
9724.505,"But paradoxically, I"
"mean,","not really, but it"
9728.72,can seem like a paradox.
9729.86,Once you know how to
"meditate,",then you
9732.29,can meditate doing
all,of those things.
9734.39,Meditation is totally compatible
with,playing the guitar
9736.73,or skiing or doing any
ordinary,thing you like to do.
9740.75,So once you know
how,"to meditate,"
9743.09,"and again, it's totally"
natural,in the beginning
9745.28,to formalize it and to set
aside,time each day to do it
9748.46,because it is a training.
9749.693,"I mean, it is something"
that,"in the beginning,"
9751.61,you have to get used to.
9752.74,But once you're
getting,"used to it,"
9756.24,then there is no good reason
not,to be experiencing
9759.62,this thing I'm
calling,"meditation,"
9761.57,this insight into the center
looseness,"of consciousness,"
9767.33,the non-selfhood
of,consciousness.
9771.53,You should experience
it,when you're
9774.74,playing your favorite
sport,or when you're having
9777.08,a conversation with somebody.
9780.6,Then to come back to
your,initial assumption
9782.88,"about eyes closed,"
a,"lot of practice,"
9786.67,even formal practice
can,be done eyes open.
9789.15,And it's important
to,do it as open
9791.1,because so much of our
anchoring,of our sense of self
9794.43,is based on visual cues.
9796.24,"I mean, we know that you"
can,if you give people
9799.14,"the right visual cues,"
you,can translocate
9801.937,their sense of self.
9802.77,You can give them an
out-of-body,experience
9804.84,"with a video display,"
where,you can literally
9808.02,make them feel like there's
a,body swapping illusion.
9811.398,You can make them feel that
they're,in another person's
9813.69,body looking back
at,their body if you
9816.96,run the cameras the right way.
9818.31,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've done this
in,"VR, seeing an image of--"
9821.34,they create an avatar
for,you and then
9822.93,your bodily movements generate
the,"movements of the avatar,"
9825.78,and you start gaining presence
as,they call it in the VR lingo
9830.52,very quickly.
9831.51,And then pretty
"soon,",you lose sense
9834.87,of your own bodily
representation.,
9837.12,And it's a little eerie.
9839.52,What's eerie is to me
is,"going back into,"
9843.78,"of course never left, but back"
into,your actual body when
9847.11,the VR goggles pop off.
9848.82,The world seems
almost,overwhelming
9850.65,the number of
sensory,stimuli that
9852.66,"are in a laboratory room,"
which,is actually quite sparse.
9857.1,So exactly what
you,"described, this"
9858.69,translocation of notions of
self,through visual experience.
9862.62,SAM HARRIS: But
"conversely,",when you
9864.12,lose the sense of
"self,",the sense of self
9866.76,"I'm talking about,"
it,can be especially
9869.49,vivid and salient
with,eyes open.
9872.82,Because so many of your
reference,points to selfhood
9876.09,are delivered
"visually,",especially
9878.46,in a social situation.
9879.58,"So like, I'm talking to you,"
you're,looking back at me.
9882.69,So the implication
of,your gaze is
9885.42,that I'm over here behind my
face,implicated by your gaze.
9890.28,So the sense that you're
looking,at something
9893.28,is the sense of self
in,that social context.
9896.58,And if your facial expression
"changes,",I'm saying something
9899.79,and if you kind of
furrow,"your brow, like,"
9902.13,what the hell is he-- and I can
read,"into that facial change,"
9905.07,some interstate of yours
that,is salient to me.
9908.25,"All of a sudden, we've"
got,this sort of dance of.
9910.5,"Like, I'm noticing"
you,"reacting to me,"
9913.08,and that's changing the way
I'm,feeling about what I'm--
9917.59,That's the purview of
every,neurosis everyone
9921.6,"didn't want, right?"
9922.56,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
every,relationship.
9924.227,I had a girlfriend when I was
a,"post-doc who was very, very--"
9928.32,"she was brilliant,"
"really,",still is.
9930.6,And she always said that
every,"relationship, there"
9934.035,are four arrows.
9934.95,She used to say she's a
"neuroscientist,",still is.
9937.08,And said there's the arrow of--
9940.206,"she was talking to me,"
so,"she said, me to you"
9942.735,and kind of what you
perceive,coming from me.
9944.61,And then there's
you,"to me, and then"
9945.93,there's an arrow from the middle
going,right back at of each one
9948.72,"of us, which is our"
own,perception of what
9950.617,the other person is
thinking,"about us,"
9952.2,and it's feeding back
on,the other arrow.
9954.0,And she gave me this
very,clear but model
9957.72,of basically relationships.
9960.3,"The relationship failed, but"
it,"was good while it lasted,"
9962.91,I should say.
9965.25,But the four arrow
model,of relationships
9967.68,actually shows up in every type
of,"one-on-one relationship,"
9971.64,and is probably an
under,description
9973.26,of the total number of arrows.
9974.79,But is I think it's exactly
what,you're describing
9976.29,is that perception of self
through,the eyes of other
9978.66,whether or not we're empathic
or,not strongly shapes
9981.45,the way that we access
different,context dependent rule
9983.75,sets about what we're
going,to say or not.
9985.5,"And it's very dynamic, right?"
9987.072,SAM HARRIS: Yeah.
9987.78,But the freedom that I think we
want,and people can sometimes
9992.7,experience this
just,"haphazardly,"
9994.39,but the center of the bull's
eye,from the meditative point
9997.59,of view is to get off that
ride,entirely and to--
10002.15,so that losing the sense
of,self in this context
10004.88,of a social encounter is to
give,"up your face, essentially."
10013.58,And what that entails
is,or what that gives
10018.56,you is the free attention to
actually,just pay attention
10022.58,to the other person.
10023.69,And the other person
is,now no longer quite
10026.78,an object in the
world,"for you, there's"
10029.66,really just a kind of a totality
of,which that person is a part.
10036.16,"And actually, Martin Buber,"
the,mystical Jewish philosopher
10043.06,talked about the
I-thou,relationship.
10045.25,And I think it's been a long
time,since I've read Buber.
10048.34,But and I don't know
if,he goes far enough
10052.24,"to be truly non-dualistic, but"
there's,distinction between I
10055.42,and thou because the thou
part,"of it is, I think,"
10060.67,potentially this.
10062.55,"Again, it's been several"
decades,since I read him.
10066.13,But there's a way of
beholding,another person where
10071.95,you have the free attention
to,simply behold them.
10077.44,You no longer care what
they,think about you.
10080.83,You don't feel neurotically
implicated,by their gaze.
10084.79,You don't feel-- you're simply
the,space in which they're
10088.6,"appearing, and so you're free."
10094.6,"So by definition, you're"
no,longer self-conscious.
10100.57,"And this phrase,"
"self-consciousness,",really
10102.4,"does get at this,"
what,I'm calling
10105.85,"the self, the illusory self"
as,a kind of contraction.
10109.33,And you can notice
this,for yourself.
10111.61,Just imagine what
it's,like to go
10115.51,from not being self-conscious to
suddenly,being self-conscious.
10119.74,And the proximate
cause,of this almost
10124.12,invariably is suddenly
recognizing,that somebody
10128.11,is looking at you.
10129.1,It's like you're in a
Starbucks,and you're alone
10131.935,and you're reading the
newspaper,or whatever it is.
10134.06,And this now sounds
highly,anachronistic.
10136.75,It's been three years since
I've,held a physical newspaper
10139.84,in a Starbucks.
10141.43,But you're just minding
your,own business.
10144.37,"And you look up,"
and,you're seeing
10147.4,a room full of strangers.
10149.36,But then you notice that
someone,is just looking at you.
10153.46,And so that moment
of,"eye contact,"
10156.25,suddenly that throws you back on
yourself,"as a kind of suddenly,"
10160.6,you're the object in the
world,for that other person.
10163.99,That recognition is
the,"tightening there,"
10169.73,the kind of contraction there
is,a further ramification
10176.51,of this feeling most of us
have,most of the time of being
10182.9,the center of experience.
10186.935,It's like we're all
walking,around with a fist.
10189.95,And in moments of
"self-consciousness,",
10191.69,the fist gets really tight.
10193.82,And that's the thing that gets
fully,relaxed when you discover
10199.07,"this, what in various point's"
called,the nature of mind
10203.87,or the non-dual nature
of,consciousness.
10206.69,It's just that there is no
center,to this experience.
10209.63,And when you
recognize,"no center,"
10211.97,then even when your gaze is
aimed,"at another person's gaze,"
10215.96,there is no implication
going,back to the center
10218.615,because there is no center.
10219.74,And rather than that being an
experience,of weird detachment
10225.41,"or confusion, it's"
actually,an experience
10229.76,of greater relationship because
you're,no longer defending it.
10234.82,You're not defending
anything,over here.
10237.35,You're not braced
against,"anything,"
10239.24,you're just the space in which
that,person is showing up.
10242.73,And so it's an
experience,of being
10246.14,much more comfortable in the
presence,"of another person,"
10250.58,"whatever your relationship,"
because,you're not contracting.
10256.19,"Again, and this is meditation."
10257.66,This is meditation that is
totally,compatible with having
10260.18,a conversation with somebody.
10262.31,And then when you notice
your,"self contracting,"
10264.86,when you notice you're
not,"meditating anymore,"
10268.76,you're actually reacting.
10269.84,"Like, they just said something"
or,looked a certain way
10272.21,"and now, you're cast"
back,upon yourself
10275.21,in relationship to
"them,",that becomes
10279.1,a kind of mindfulness alarm.
10281.11,Then it becomes the
unsatisfactoriness,of that.
10287.05,Psychologically becomes
more,and more salient.
10293.33,"Because one, that's not"
the,way you want to be.
10295.947,"I mean, it's like,"
it's,the antithesis
10297.53,of it being as comfortable
as,you were a moment ago.
10300.62,"But two, it's something"
you're,doing unnecessarily.
10306.54,"it's like, again, you're"
making,a fist when
10309.07,you don't have to make a fist.
10313.02,"Again, you can leave aside"
all,those circumstances
10315.18,where it's appropriate
to,react to someone.
10317.31,And I'm into martial
arts,and self defense.
10320.7,"And yes, you're not supposed"
to,be just this puddle of goo
10323.58,out in the world who can be
just,mistreated by people
10326.01,and never put up resistance.
10328.65,But it's psychologically
even,if a state like anger
10336.43,or contraction is sometimes
normative,"and appropriate,"
10340.9,"the question is, how long is it"
normative,and appropriate for?
10344.725,How long do you want
to,stay angry for?
10347.95,"In my experience, these kind of"
classically,negative emotions
10352.67,like anger and fear are
appropriate,as salience cues.
10357.77,They orient you to an emergency
or,a potential emergency.
10362.57,But then in dealing
with,"the emergency,"
10365.63,they're almost never the
state,you want to be in.
10370.1,"Like, it's better to actually be"
calm,in an emergency in a way.
10374.72,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, absolutely."
10377.12,"And again, the language is"
insufficient,to describe
10380.88,what you're telling us.
10382.22,But I think what
comes,to mind for me
10384.74,is this distinction between
situational,awareness
10387.38,and self-awareness.
10388.34,And we need both
but,under conditions
10391.31,"of emergency, true emergency,"
or,motivated desire.
10397.79,We need to dial down the
amount,of self-awareness
10403.7,in order to be more effective
within,the situational
10406.28,awareness.
10407.48,But you said something
very,important.
10409.58,And my lab has been
working,on fear-like states
10412.31,"for a long time, so I confess"
I'm,"going to rob this from you,"
10416.045,but I'll credit you
every,"time I describe it,"
10417.92,is that the fear of the
threat,detection state
10423.89,or set of events acts
as,a flag but is not
10428.45,meant to persist in the
way,that the flag went up
10432.26,if one is to be in their
most,adaptive state.
10435.41,"Actually, Jocko Willink and"
I,were talking about this.
10437.66,He talks a lot about detachment
and,"open gaze, things"
10440.24,that my lab is interested in
visual,system and autonomic
10442.73,interactions.
10443.43,So why broadening
the,gaze literally
10445.64,broadens the time
domain,of thinking
10447.365,and you come up
with,new solutions
10449.42,to complex problems in
real,time and so on.
10453.32,And you're describing
an,everyday set
10455.42,of interactions where
that,could be very useful.
10457.43,"And yet, there seems to be"
something,that about the way
10461.48,you describe meditation and
what,you've managed to arrive at
10465.17,and what practitioners of
meditation,"can arrive at,"
10468.74,which is something
more,than that.
10471.09,It's not just about being
effective,"or optimizing,"
10473.997,all the language we see thrown
around,a lot in the space
10476.33,"that I live in these days, but"
something,fundamentally more
10481.64,important about how to
experience,life and the self.
10487.07,This realization
that,what you thought
10489.14,was there was
never,"really there,"
10491.09,but that there are
constraints,that limit that.
10494.67,And so to try and fracture
those,constraints one by one.
10498.65,Would you say that
meditation,as a practice done
10501.26,for a few minutes each day
or,"with the app, that it's"
10503.66,kind of a step function?
10505.49,Is it very non-linear in
terms,of people's progress?
10510.44,I'm certainly going to go start
doing,more meditation based
10514.97,"on this discussion, truly."
10516.56,Because any time
someone,describes
10519.23,that there's kind of a myth
that,"we've been living in,"
10523.7,I become obsessed with the
idea,of dissolving that myth.
10527.15,That's a very seductive
"phrase,",so thank you
10529.76,for using that one.
10530.563,There is no better
marketing,"tool,"
10531.98,which is I realize what
you're,not trying to do here.
10534.188,But that's for me to
capture,my efforts.
10537.05,You tell me that there's
a,myth that I'm living in
10539.58,and that it can be
"dissolved,",and that opens up
10541.97,a better landscape.
10544.61,What is the process like?
10546.74,Do some people make
progress,very quickly?
10549.32,Do some people experience
kind,of step functions
10552.89,towards progress?
10554.12,What does the meditation
practice,look like over time?
10558.95,Do you still meditate or
have,you just threaded it
10561.17,"through your jujitsu, your"
"writing,","your daily life,"
10564.06,"your coffee, your time"
with,"your wife, et cetera?"
10566.465,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah,"
also,just to come back
10569.24,to talk about the
myth,for a second.
10570.74,So what you just enunciated
was,a kind of a second doorway
10574.61,into this whole project.
10576.0,"So like, the usual door is"
through,"the door of suffering,"
10581.787,for lack of a better word.
10582.87,When people feel unhappy in
a,variety of ways and they
10586.77,get more sensitized
to,the mechanics
10588.66,of their own unhappiness.
10590.04,And meditation is
one,of the things
10592.41,on the menu that
is,explicitly built
10595.05,as a remedy for unhappiness.
10598.83,And it is.
10599.52,And that's I think
that's,probably
10601.29,the most common path to this.
10602.67,But another path is just
intellectual,interest.
10605.562,"I mean, just wanting"
to,know what's
10607.02,real about the mind subjectively
in,a first person way.
10611.94,And there's no contradiction
between,"those two things,"
10614.25,and I'm motivated
by,both of them.
10615.67,But it's a totally
valid,doorway into this.
10622.49,There are definitely
step,functions.
10623.99,"I mean, I would say"
there,"are at least two,"
10628.1,and they really are
articulated,along
10631.88,the lines of the
framework,I've been
10635.06,describing of dualistic and
non-dualistic,mindfulness.
10638.75,"So in the beginning,"
you're,going to start out--
10641.81,99.9% of people will start out
dualistically,paying attention
10646.46,and noticing the difference
between,being distracted
10648.74,by thought and then being
on,"the object of attention,"
10652.71,whether it's the breath
or,sounds or whatever.
10655.41,"And eventually, that opens"
up,to all possible objects
10659.0,"of attention,"
including,thoughts.
10661.07,And there's still
this,fluctuation
10662.93,between being distracted and
then,being mindful of whatever.
10667.52,And the fact that it's open
to,all possible objects
10670.22,differentiates this
type,of practice
10671.99,from anything that is
narrowly,focused on one
10674.33,object like a mantra
or,a visualization
10677.06,as I was just saying.
10679.01,Those are other
paths,of practice
10680.78,that are more
concentration-based,and
10683.52,interesting.
10684.02,But the benefit of mindfulness
is,"that very quickly, you"
10689.01,realize it's by definition
compatible,with all possible
10691.53,"experience, because"
you're,not artificially
10695.07,contracting your attention
down,"to something,"
10697.32,you're just being aware
of,the next thing.
10699.57,"A sight, a sound,"
a,"taste, a thought."
10703.62,So the first step function
is,to very clearly experience
10709.55,the difference between
being,lost in thought
10712.46,and being clearly aware
of,"any part of experience,"
10715.95,including thought.
10716.96,"And to notice the freedom,"
the,comparative psychological
10721.52,freedom that gives.
10722.81,So something's made you
angry,and now you're
10725.893,thinking about all
the,reasons why
10727.31,you should be angry and
have,every right to be angry
10729.477,and what you're going to tell
that,"person when you see them,"
10732.47,and then you notice
you're,thinking.
10734.42,And you notice the connection
between,the thought
10737.12,and the anger.
10738.23,"Like, the minute spent lost"
in,thought about what's
10742.76,making you angry
is,the thing that
10744.89,dragged through the
physiology,of anger.
10749.27,And the moment you notice
that,"once you're mindful,"
10753.17,"once you can be mindful, you"
can,notice thought as thought
10756.2,and how quickly that dissipates.
10758.57,That's just the language
and,the imagery.
10760.46,You couldn't hold on
to,it if you wanted to.
10762.9,And then you notice the
physiology,of the anger
10765.08,is just this kind
of,"meaningless,"
10770.09,kind of inner incandescence
that,has its own half
10772.89,"life and degrades very,"
very,quickly when you're
10774.89,no longer thinking
about,the reasons
10776.39,why you should be angry.
10777.59,"You can't hold on to the anger,"
the,anger itself dissipates.
10781.46,And from the point of view of
the,"one who's being mindful,"
10784.79,this is tremendous relief.
10786.53,"And at minimum, it's"
a,degree of freedom.
10788.6,You can at that point
"decide,","well, how long"
10791.57,do I want to be angry for?
10793.07,Is it useful to stay angry?
10794.25,Do I want to be angry for
one,"minute, two minutes, five"
10796.542,"minutes, 10 minutes?"
10798.02,And before you have that
capacity,"to be mindful,"
10801.74,you're going to
helplessly,be as angry
10803.488,as you're going to be
for,as long as you're
10805.28,going to be that way
just,based on the time
10808.91,course of your thinking
about,"it, brooding about it,"
10811.1,telling your wife about it.
10814.412,It's just going to be this
conversation-based,misadventure
10818.09,in negative states
of,"mind, and you"
10823.94,are going to be the
hostage,of that for as long
10826.04,as you'll be the
hostage,of that.
10827.415,You have nothing
you,can do apart
10829.43,from just deciding to check
out,and watch Game of Thrones
10832.73,again for the third time.
10834.65,You can divert your attention
to,"something else, which is"
10838.46,sometimes a good thing to do.
10840.29,"But mindfulness, even"
dualistic,mindfulness
10843.26,gives you this capacity to just
observe,the mechanics of this
10848.09,and then get off the
ride,whenever you want.
10852.4,So that really is
a,step function.
10853.98,"First, there was a time"
before,"you could do that,"
10856.83,and then there's a time
after,which you can do that.
10860.11,The other step function
is,noticing that there
10865.22,is no one who is doing that.
10867.38,"I mean, this is the"
"non-duality,","the selflessness,"
10870.5,the centralessness of awareness.
10872.54,The fact that there's no place
from,which the mindfulness is
10875.27,being aimed but the
fact,that there's just
10878.15,this open condition in which
everything,"is appearing,"
10880.82,thoughts included.
10883.39,"To have you at that point, your"
mindfulness,no longer becomes--
10889.94,it's no longer this
dualistic,effort
10894.71,to strategically pay
attention,to anything
10897.89,as opposed to being
lost,"in thought,"
10900.44,it's just what's left when
the,present recognized
10906.71,thought unravels.
10908.6,"Even before it unravels,"
what's,recognized
10911.18,is you are simply identical
to,the condition in which
10914.99,everything is appearing.
10916.59,"Now, again, I'm not making"
a,Deepak Chopra-like
10922.1,metaphysical claim
about,the mind.
10924.86,I'm not saying the mind isn't
what,"the brain is doing,"
10927.53,and I'm not saying
that,you're recognizing
10929.477,the consciousness that
gave,birth to the universe.
10931.56,I'm not making any broad
claims,"about metaphysics,"
10934.97,I'm just talking about as
a,matter of experience.
10939.36,There is just this condition in
which,everything is appearing.
10942.533,And what you're
calling,"your body,"
10943.95,"again, as a matter"
of,experience--
10945.367,I'm not saying that we
can't,have third person
10948.03,conversations about physical
bodies,in the physical world.
10951.39,But as a matter of
"experience,",the only body
10954.09,you're ever going to directly
encounter,as your own
10958.71,is in appearance
and,consciousness.
10960.66,So consciousness is
not,"in your body,"
10964.12,what you're calling your
body,is in consciousness.
10967.17,"Visually, proprioceptively,"
it's,like everything is just
10970.98,appearing in this condition.
10972.22,"And again, this"
is,not a spotlight
10976.32,that you're aiming
at,"the body, there's"
10979.62,just this condition in which
"everything,",including anything
10983.25,you could call
yourself,is appearing.
10985.06,"And so yeah, the"
second,step function
10991.01,is to recognize that
this,is already true.
10996.09,Consciousness is already
without,this thing
10998.16,you've been calling your
ego,and hoping to unravel it
11002.99,through meditation.
11005.74,Consciousness is not going to
get,"any more selfless, any more"
11009.1,"centerless, any freer"
than,it always already
11011.86,is recognized as such.
11014.99,And so the step
function,at that point
11018.73,is your mindfulness
at,"that point,"
11021.41,the thing you come back to when
you're,no longer distracted
11024.2,is that recognition
again,and again.
11026.57,And then it becomes compatible
with,anything you would do.
11030.78,And so to answer
your,"question, yes,"
11032.36,"I still practice formally,"
"sometimes,",frequently.
11037.61,But I definitely miss days
and,I don't do it for--
11041.93,"I mean, I don't rule"
out,the possibility
11044.51,that I will go back on
retreat,at various times
11047.12,just to check in with that and
see,if that makes a difference.
11050.24,But I tend to sit for--
11057.42,"I mean, I've designed"
my,life so that I
11060.84,can spend a lot
of,time meditating
11064.08,without having to be
formally,meditating.
11066.07,"Like, so, I'll go for"
a,hike for two hours.
11069.263,And what I'm doing
when,I'm hiking
11070.68,is identical to what I'm doing
when,"I'm quote, ""meditating"","
11073.62,"sitting in a chair, doing"
nothing,but meditate.
11078.36,"So yeah, I'm very"
interested,in erasing
11086.22,the boundary between what
people,are calling meditation
11089.37,and the rest of life.
11090.52,And so in teaching
these,"things, I"
11093.782,tend to emphasize that
from,the beginning
11095.49,because I think it's
very,easy to set up--
11103.93,to get gold by a
bunch,of assumptions
11106.87,that cause you to be
very,split in your sense
11111.52,of what your life is about.
11113.11,And I'm sort of banking
my,meditation over here
11116.65,because I'm meditating two
hours,"a day diligently,"
11119.41,and it's going to be
really,good for me.
11121.72,"And then over here, this is the"
rest,"of my life, which is not"
11125.85,nearly as wise or as
useful,"or as like,"
11129.0,this is the stuff that is
still,the area of my problems.
11132.16,And I think it's useful to
recognize,"you've got one life,"
11139.37,and you've got this single
condition,"of consciousness,"
11143.75,and its contents in
every,mode of life.
11146.37,And there's something
to,recognize about it.
11148.61,And you're always free
to,recognize that.
11150.62,And truly even in your dreams.
11152.81,"I mean, it never stops."
11155.18,So that's what I
tend,to emphasize.
11157.803,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
"earlier,",you told us
11159.47,that meditation is not
about,changing the content
11162.68,of conscious experience.
11164.0,And in a different
podcast,"that you were on,"
11167.09,I heard you say something to
the,effect of that normally we
11171.32,are in our daily experience
and,unless we are trained
11173.81,"in meditation, unless"
we've,dissolved
11177.35,this illusion of the gap between
actor,"and self and observer,"
11184.55,that we require certain sensory
events,to create collisions
11191.0,within us and with the natural
world,that sort of blast us
11194.99,into a different mode of being.
11198.21,I want to use that
as,a way to frame up
11200.6,this idea that some things
such,as psychedelics
11204.44,"but also a very long hike,"
a,"very long fast, who knows?"
11211.52,"A banquet, different"
types,of life experiences
11215.09,do exactly the opposite of what
you're,describing meditation
11218.27,"does, which is"
that,they actively
11220.55,change the content of
our,conscious experience
11223.34,so much so that we
often,remember those
11225.41,for the rest of our lives.
11228.5,Could you tell us why
psychedelics,can be useful?
11234.51,"And here, I'll give the"
caveats,that maybe you'll
11236.66,"feel obligated to give as well,"
but,we're talking about safely
11240.47,"and responsibly,"
"age-appropriate,",
11242.54,"context-appropriate, ideally"
with,some clinical or other
11246.2,"type of guidance, legality"
"issues,","obeyed, et cetera."
11250.13,"All that stated, it"
was,psychedelics to me
11253.46,are an experience of
altered,"perception,"
11256.97,internal and external
"perception,",altered space time
11259.82,"relationship,"
somewhat,dreamlike.
11261.44,I think it was Alan Hobson at
Harvard,for a long time talked
11263.69,about the relationship between
psychedelic-like,states
11265.94,and dream-like states because
of,this distortion of space time
11270.47,dimensionality.
11272.63,And I haven't experimented
with,them much.
11277.61,I've been part of a clinical
"trial,","three doses of MDMA,"
11280.58,which certainly
altered,the quality
11283.52,of my conscious
experience,in ways
11285.26,that led to a lot of
lasting,"and at least for me,"
11287.63,valuable learning.
11289.203,So what are your what are your
thoughts,about psychedelics
11291.62,in terms of how they
intersect,with the discussion
11293.84,that we've been having?
11295.37,And what utility do they play
in,recognition of the self
11300.17,or in other sorts
of,brain changes?
11303.1,"SAM HARRIS: Well so, let's"
just,price in all those caveats
11307.52,that people can anticipate.
11310.84,These drugs are not
without,their risks.
11312.88,And one problem is that we
have,this single-term drugs
11318.31,"or psychedelics, which"
names,many different types
11320.92,"of substances, and"
they're,not all the same.
11323.2,"So like, MDMA is not even"
technically,a psychedelic.
11327.49,I think it has immense
therapeutic,"value,"
11329.98,and it actually
was,my gateway drug
11331.9,to this whole area of concern.
11335.185,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Amphetamine,"pathogen, right?"
11337.062,It's a sort of an
amphetamine,and a pathogen
11338.895,at the same time.
11339.34,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I mean"
"it's,",often called--
11341.08,ANDREW HUBERMAN: M pathogens.
11341.395,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah,"
and,a pathogen--
11342.91,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not a
"pathogen,",M pathogen.
11345.235,SAM HARRIS: And a pathogen or
an,"entactogen, it's been called."
11350.08,But it doesn't tend to
change,perception in the way
11352.9,that classic psychedelics do.
11354.43,"And it's also serotonergic,"
but,it has to be in some part
11360.76,differently.
11361.87,"And even LSD and psilocybin,"
which,are much more similar
11365.57,"and classic psychedelics,"
both,are also serotonergic
11368.53,"but they're not merely,"
and,they're also different.
11372.73,And the higher dose you take
of,"these drugs, the more--"
11375.76,"at lower doses everything,"
can,kind of seem the same.
11378.94,"At higher doses, they"
begin,to diverge.
11385.35,And we can talk about the
pharmacology,if you wanted to.
11388.7,But I would just say
that,"for many of us,"
11394.12,and certainly for
"me,",psychedelics
11396.43,were indispensable in the
beginning,in proving to me
11401.11,that this was--
11404.98,the first person interrogation
of,the mind was worth doing.
11409.66,Because I was somebody
who,"at age 17 or 18,"
11414.46,before I had any real experience
with,"MDMA or LSD or psilocybin,"
11424.0,if you had taught me how
to,"meditate at that point,"
11426.61,I think I would have just
bounced,off the whole project.
11430.24,I think I was so cerebral
in,just my engagement
11438.4,with anything.
11439.36,I was so skeptical of any of
the,religious and spiritual
11445.27,traditions that have given us
most,of our meditation talk
11452.17,that I think I just would have--
11454.45,And I know many of these people.
11456.37,I have tried to teach Richard
Dawkins,to meditate and Daniel
11459.707,Dennett to meditate.
11460.54,I've ambushed them
with,meditation
11463.0,both in a group
setting,and one-on-one.
11466.12,"Not Dan but Richard, I"
ambushed,on my own podcast
11470.62,with a guided meditation.
11472.36,And he closes his
"eyes,","he looks inside,"
11480.65,and there's nothing
of,interest to see.
11485.63,He doesn't have the
conceptual,interest in him
11491.47,that would cause him to
persist,long enough to find out
11495.25,that there's a there there.
11496.99,"Now, this is not a problem"
with,LSD or psilocybin or MDMA.
11503.07,I know that if I gave
him,100 micrograms of LSD
11506.22,or 5 grams of mushrooms or
25,milligrams of psilocybin--
11513.973,that's probably not
the,analogous dosage
11515.64,to the 5 grams of mushrooms.
11516.84,5 grams of mushrooms
would,be more than that.
11522.18,I forget what it is of
"MDMA,",maybe 120 milligrams.
11526.265,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
the,"maps dose, which"
11528.57,is the one that's under clinical
trials,is 125 milligrams
11531.66,with an option of a
75,milligram booster.
11534.39,"Funny, I remember it."
11535.53,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah,"
that's,"strange,"
11536.905,the facts that come to hand.
11539.55,But there's just no
possibility,that nothing's
11545.19,going to happen right now.
11546.3,"Something with a psychedelic,"
with,"MDMA, most people"
11550.35,tend to have certainly
under,"any kind of guidance,"
11552.48,"tend to have a very positive,"
pro-social,experience.
11558.66,But with a
"psychedelic,",you might
11561.24,have a somewhat
terrifying,experience
11567.74,"if you have quote, a bad trip."
11569.66,And I've certainly
had,those experiences
11571.4,on LSD and to some
"degree,",on psilocybin.
11575.03,But the prospect that
nothing,is going to happen
11579.74,is just in nearly a million
cases,out of a million just
11585.2,not in the cards.
11586.02,"I mean, just"
"neurophysiologically,",
11588.74,something is going to happen
with,the requisite dose of one
11591.89,of these drugs.
11593.51,And if that thing that
happens,is psychologically
11599.51,at all normative and pleasant
and,"interesting and valuable,"
11604.5,which it is so much of
the,time and certainly
11606.89,under the appropriate set
and,"setting and guidance,"
11612.32,it can be a lot of the time
for,virtually everybody.
11616.88,"Again, there are caveats."
11618.785,"If you're prone,"
if,you think you
11620.21,have a proclivity for
schizophrenia,or bipolar
11624.83,"disorder, this is almost"
certainly,not for you.
11628.7,And anyone doing the
studies,at Johns Hopkins
11632.0,for the therapeutic effects
of,"any of these drugs,"
11636.2,they're there ruling
out,people with--
11638.42,first degree relatives with any
of,these clinical conditions.
11645.25,So for somebody
like,me at 18 who
11649.81,didn't know that this was
an,area of not only interest
11655.18,but would it be the
center,of gravity
11658.09,"for the rest of his life, if"
only,he could pay attention
11661.09,clearly enough to
see,"that it could be,"
11665.2,I was someone who very likely--
11667.24,"again, I don't have the"
counterfactual,in hand.
11669.358,I don't know what
would,have happened
11670.9,if someone had
forced,me to meditate
11673.36,for an hour at that point.
11674.92,But I know I wasn't interested
in,it until I took MDMA.
11682.35,I know I wasn't having
these,kinds of experiences
11684.72,spontaneously that
showed,me that there
11688.05,was an inner landscape
that,was worth exploring.
11691.65,I was a very hard-headed skeptic
who,was very interested in lots
11695.25,"of things, but there was no"
alternative,to me just thinking
11699.63,more about those things.
11700.95,"I mean, the idea that there's"
some,other way of grasping
11705.12,cognitively at the
interesting,parts of the world
11710.4,beyond thinking about the
"world,",that just wouldn't
11714.75,have computed for me at all.
11719.7,No one ever gave me a book
to,read or I never had--
11724.92,"The noun, meditation,"
very,likely
11727.83,meant absolutely nothing to me
before,"I took my first dose of,"
11733.59,in this case it was MDMA.
11736.44,So what the drug experience
did,for me is it just proved--
11742.62,So one of the
limitations,of drug
11745.38,"is that, obviously, no matter"
how,"good the experience,"
11748.47,the drug wears off
and,then you're
11750.12,back to in more or
less,"your usual form,"
11754.65,and now you have a
memory,of the experience.
11757.32,And it can be a
fairly,dim memory.
11758.855,"I mean, some of"
these,experiences
11760.23,are so discontinuous with
normal,waking consciousness
11763.717,that it can be like
trying,to remember
11765.3,a dream that just degrades
over,the course of seconds.
11769.74,And then it could have been the
most,intense dream you've ever
11772.47,"had and for whatever reason,"
you,can barely get a purchase
11775.65,on what it was about.
11777.132,And there are some
psychedelic,experiences
11781.32,that are analogous to that.
11782.47,But for most people
most,"of the time,"
11785.22,there's a residue
of,this experience.
11787.02,"And with something like MDMA,"
they,can be quite vivid.
11792.44,Where you recognize there
was,a way of being that
11797.0,is quite different than what I'm
tending,"to access by default,"
11800.87,and it is different
in,ways that are just
11810.1,obviously better and
psychologically,more healthy.
11813.76,"I mean, it's possible to"
be,healthy psychologically
11817.6,in a way that I never imagined.
11821.62,And then when you link it up
to,the traditional literature
11826.84,"around any of this stuff,"
"again,",so much of it
11829.6,is shot through
with,superstition
11832.57,and other worldliness
of,religion.
11834.49,And as you know and I think
you're,"listeners probably know,"
11838.9,I've spent a lot of time
criticizing,all that.
11841.06,But there is a baby in the
bathwater,to all of that.
11844.27,It's not that somebody
like,Jesus or the Buddha
11849.76,or any of the matriarchs and
patriarchs,of the world's
11853.03,"religions, it's not that they"
were,all conscious frauds
11857.02,"or temporal lobe epileptics,"
there's,a pathological lens
11863.2,that you can put
on,top of all that.
11865.825,But once you have one of these
experiences,on psychedelics
11869.68,"or on a drug like MDMA, you"
know,that there's a there there.
11873.76,You know that unconditional
love,is a possibility.
11877.06,You know that feeling
truly,one with nature.
11883.57,"I mean, just so one"
with,nature that you
11886.33,could spend 10 hours
in,front of a tree
11889.27,and find that to be the
most,rewarding experience
11891.79,of your life.
11893.92,That's a possible
state,of consciousness.
11895.735,"Now, it may not be the"
state,of consciousness
11897.61,you want all the time.
11898.863,You don't want to
be,the crazy guy
11900.28,by the tree you
know,who can't have
11902.05,a conversation
about,anything else.
11904.76,But once you have one
of,"these experiences,"
11908.66,"you recognize, OK, there's"
some,reason why I'm not having
11914.01,the beatific vision right now.
11916.08,And I can't even figure out
how,to aim my attention so as
11919.44,to have anything like it.
11921.04,"And that's a problem,"
because,"it's available,"
11924.48,and it is among the best things
that,has ever happened to me.
11930.78,And now I can just only dimly
remember,what that was like.
11934.86,So how do I get back
there,on some level?
11938.01,"So that invites, again,"
a,logic of changes.
11941.76,A logic of seeking changes in
the,"contents of consciousness,"
11945.55,which sets someone up for
this,protracted or seemingly
11951.99,protracted and fairly
frustrating,search
11955.53,to game their
nervous,system so as
11959.13,to have those kinds of
experiences,more and more.
11963.87,"And again, it's not that"
that's,in principle fruitless
11967.32,but it is from the point of
view,"of the core insight,"
11971.97,the core wisdom of
what,I would take
11974.1,from a tradition like
"Buddhism,",which is not
11976.99,the only tradition that
has,"given voice to this,"
11978.99,but I would argue it's
given,it voice to it
11981.54,in the most articulate way.
11985.08,"Again, leaving aside"
any,of the superstition
11987.96,and other worldliness
and,miracles that we
11992.16,don't have to talk
about,at the moment.
11993.82,And you certainly don't
need,to endorse in order
11995.82,to be interested in this stuff.
12000.56,And so that's the
bifurcation,between all
12006.03,of the utility of
psychedelics,and what
12008.43,I'm talking about under
the,rubric of meditation
12012.15,"is at this point of OK, once you"
realize,"there's a there there,"
12016.53,what do you do?
12017.4,And what's the logic by
which,you're led to do it?
12020.13,And it's possible if
you're,only framework
12023.37,is the good
"experiences,",the good
12026.1,feels you had on
whatever,drug it was
12029.7,and a further discussion of
what,that path of changes
12037.89,can look like--
12039.24,and that can become in
a,"religious context,"
12041.13,it can come in just a
purely,psychedelic context
12043.73,or some combination of the two.
12048.19,I think you can be
misled,to just seek
12054.43,lots of peak experiences.
12055.708,You're just trying
to,string together
12057.25,a lot of peak experiences hoping
they're,"going to change you,"
12060.37,"every one of which,"
by,definition is
12063.34,going to be impermanent.
12065.17,It's first it wasn't
"there,","then it's there,"
12067.48,and then it's no longer there.
12069.05,And then you've
got,a memory of it.
12072.17,What I think what
everyone,really
12074.56,wants whether they know it or
"not,","and they're right to want,"
12077.47,is a type of freedom that
is,compatible with even
12082.33,ordinary states of
"consciousness,",which
12085.03,can ride along with them
into,extraordinary states
12088.15,of consciousness.
12089.09,So I hadn't done
psychedelics,for 25 years
12092.8,"because, again, they were super"
useful,"for me in the beginning,"
12096.1,then I discovered meditation on
the,"basis of those experiences,"
12101.23,got really into
meditation,"and realized,"
12103.0,"OK, this is a much more--"
12108.16,"conceptually, this makes"
much,more sense to me.
12110.26,This is delivering the goods
in,terms of my experience.
12115.6,There's no need to
keep,having these--
12117.4,seeking these peak
experiences,with drugs.
12121.21,But it had been 25 years
since,I had done that
12124.03,and there was this resurgence
in,research on psychedelics.
12126.73,And I was being asked
about,"psychedelics,"
12128.89,and I was talking about
their,"utility for me,"
12131.05,"but again, these were"
distant,memories.
12133.39,And there was also one type
of,psychedelic experience
12136.75,I was aware that
I,had never had.
12138.4,I had never done a high dose
of,mushrooms blindfolded.
12142.85,Every mushroom trip
I'd,ever had I'd
12144.46,been out in nature
and,interacting with--
12147.77,it's just been a very
transformed,sensory experience
12150.4,of the world and
of,other people.
12153.31,But I'd never done it
"alone,","blindfolded,"
12155.23,"just purely inwardly directed,"
and,at a high dosage.
12159.73,I'd done high doses of
LSD,but not mushrooms.
12166.72,So I did that and
it,was very useful.
12170.08,And I spoke about it on my
"podcast,",and there's actually--
12173.23,I think if you search
Sam,"Harris mushroom
12175.48 trip on YouTube, you"
get,the 19 minute version
12178.03,of my describing that trip.
12180.82,"It was incredibly useful,"
but,what was doubly useful
12185.05,was my mindfulness training in
the,context of that explosion
12191.29,of synesthesia.
12192.67,"I mean, it was such an"
overwhelmingly,strong
12195.28,"experience, and there"
were,so many moments where
12201.55,it could have gone
one,way or the other
12203.41,based on my sense
of,"just, OK, I'm"
12208.42,going to try to resist this.
12210.52,It was in truth irresistible
because,"it was just so much,"
12213.8,but there were moments where
I,"was aware of, OK, this is--"
12220.15,letting go of self
in,this context
12224.8,is the thing that
is,going to make
12230.227,the difference between
heaven,and hell
12231.81,here because there
are,experiences that
12234.48,are so extreme
that,you can't even
12237.03,tell if it's agony or ecstasy.
12240.18,Everything is turned up to 11.
12242.04,And the difference
between,the two is--
12246.18,the tipping point is just--
12248.37,really it's a high
wire,act in some sense.
12250.8,You could just fall to
one,side or the other.
12254.43,"Yeah, so what I think"
people,want is--
12260.57,they certainly want
to,be able to extract
12262.4,from the psychedelic
"experience,",wisdom
12265.88,that is applicable to ordinary
states,of consciousness.
12268.65,"It's like, what is the"
thing,you can realize
12271.22,in a moment of
having,a conversation
12272.93,with your child that
isn't,distracting you
12276.74,from that relationship?
12278.07,It's not a memory of
when,the world dissolved
12280.79,or when you were
indistinguishable,"from the sky,"
12284.36,but it's just a way of
having,free attention
12289.16,and unconditional
love,in this totally
12294.71,ordinary and potentially
chaotic,"human experience, which"
12300.02,can be psychologically
fraught,and you
12302.48,can meet iterations
of,yourself that you
12305.24,don't like that
are,not equipping
12307.19,you to be the best possible
person,in that relationship.
12310.64,And what we want to do is
cut,through all of that
12314.42,and actually be in
love,with our lives
12319.04,and with the people in our
lives,more and more of the time.
12322.26,And I'm not saying that repeated
psychedelic,journeys can't
12331.75,be integral to that
"project,",but you
12334.57,know that the project can't
be,being high all the time.
12339.31,So whatever is extractable from
the,occasional psychedelic trip
12344.86,has got to be manageable into
ordinary,waking consciousness.
12348.16,And the real point of contact
does,run through this--
12353.36,what I've been calling
the,illusion of the self.
12355.6,"And again, that part"
is,discoverable without
12360.13,any changes in contents.
12362.41,So you don't have to suddenly
feel,the energy of your body
12366.43,rush out and be continuous
with,the ocean of energy that
12370.48,is not your body.
12372.25,That's an experience
that's,"there to be had,"
12374.17,"I mean, there's no doubt."
12375.58,But the truth is just
looking,at this cup
12384.26,is just as formless and
as,mysterious as that when
12389.42,seen in the right
"way,",and that's
12392.12,what meditation encourages
one,to recognize.
12396.57,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
share,the experience
12399.08,that MDMA significantly
altered,my perception of what's
12403.97,possible in terms of an
emotional,stance towards self
12407.3,"and others, including"
"animals,",something that
12410.42,runs very deep for me and that
I,had been actively suppressing
12413.48,in anticipation of having
me,put my dog down.
12415.52,"But also, I don't know how"
to,"frame it except to say,"
12420.05,my lab did animal
research,"for years,"
12421.76,and I was always very conflicted
about,it because I love animals
12424.743,and yet I wanted to
understand,the brain
12426.41,and we need to work on
animal,"brains, and we--"
12430.55,SAM HARRIS: Rodents or what?
12431.72,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'll"
be,very direct about this.
12433.97,I've worked on many species.
12435.8,I've worked on mice and rats.
12440.99,"Admittedly, I've worked on--"
12442.28,I've done some cat experiments.
12443.99,"I've worked on large, non-human"
primates,including macaques.
12448.61,I no longer work on
any,of those species.
12451.4,"I've worked on cuttlefish,"
"cephalopods,",a discussion
12455.66,"for another time, brilliant"
little,"creatures, maybe"
12459.47,"as smart as us, or who knows?"
12461.9,Maybe smarter.
12462.98,And now I work on humans
because,I couldn't reconcile
12467.93,"the challenge inside me,"
which,was my love of animals
12471.32,and working on them.
12472.2,I just couldn't
do,it any longer.
12473.9,And MDMA didn't set
that,"transition,"
12477.32,that transition actually
had,been set a lot earlier.
12479.93,It's something I
really,grappled with.
12481.52,It didn't keep me up at
"night,",but it was always
12483.56,in the back of my mind.
12485.21,"In any event, I hope"
what,we discovered
12486.86,"was worthwhile, but this"
that's,a bigger debate.
12490.85,And I've strong
feelings,"about this,"
12492.47,and maybe it's a topic
for,another podcast.
12496.52,But I'm very happy that
now,"I work on humans,"
12499.37,and they can tell
me,if they want
12500.75,to be part of the
experiment,"or not,"
12502.25,and I trust them and
I,trust their answers.
12506.54,"I think that MDMA, in its role"
as,"an pathogen, I think really"
12510.77,did set an understanding
of,what's real and true.
12513.77,So I think truths
like,that become--
12517.34,I felt that they didn't
hit,me square in the face.
12520.34,The feeling behind the
conflict,"made itself evident,"
12524.057,and what to do about
it,made itself evident.
12525.89,So I suppose MDMA did
assist,the transition
12529.04,"to purely human research, as"
opposed,to animal research.
12532.658,The other thing that
I,noticed it did
12534.2,is it made it not
scary,to confront
12538.28,things that were scary to
confront,in my conscious life.
12541.243,And I could think about
things,"in my conscious life,"
12543.41,but it brought
them,close in a way
12545.81,that I could get closer
and,closer to the flame
12547.82,and then gain some
understanding.,
12549.32,I'm still amazed at how answers
"arrive,",both during the session
12556.46,and in the weeks and
months,that follow if one
12558.668,puts the attention to it.
12559.71,I think that's why
it's,important to have
12561.418,a guide of some sort
or,to have some pseudo
12563.81,structure because otherwise
one,can get attached
12568.16,to the sounds in the room.
12569.48,And there's probably
meaning,"there,"
12571.77,but I wanted to do
some,deeper work.
12573.65,I have not had experience
with,"psilocybin, at least"
12576.02,not since my youth.
12576.862,And I don't recommend
young,people do it.
12578.57,I regret doing LSD and
psilocybin,as a young person.
12580.948,I don't say that for politically
correct,reasons or liability
12583.49,"reasons, I just think my"
mind,was not developed.
12586.94,But I'm intrigued by something--
so,here's the question--
12591.27,how is it that psilocybin
in,particular and high dose
12593.78,psilocybin and the ego
dissolution,that people
12596.66,talk about on psilocybin--
how,do you think that lines up
12601.7,with some of the
experiences,that you've
12604.31,been describing for a
adequate,meditation practice?
12607.64,Because that's something that
I,did not experience on MDMA.
12610.46,"In fact, if anything, I"
experienced,for the first time
12613.67,what really feeling like
a,"isolated container was,"
12618.62,and the difference-- and how
empathy,and being bounded--
12621.385,"having, in other words,"
good,boundaries and empathy
12623.51,could be symbiotic.
12624.497,I experienced that for
the,first time there.
12626.33,And I do think that
there,is learning inside
12628.52,of these states that
translates,into everyday life
12630.8,when one is not on these states.
12632.588,And the last thing
I'll,"say is, no, I"
12634.13,don't feel the impulse to go
and,do 20 more MDMA sessions.
12638.84,I think the three as
part,of this study
12641.75,were very effective for me.
12645.08,"As I say, if you hear the"
calling,"again you might do it,"
12647.78,but I'm very curious about
psilocybin,in particular
12650.9,and this notion
of,ego dissolution
12652.94,because we've been
talking,about the self.
12654.92,"SAM HARRIS: Well, so"
there,are different ways
12657.65,In which the sense of self
can,be eroded or expanded.
12664.24,There's lots of experiences that
can,still have a center to them
12668.47,but be very novel
and,transformational.
12674.77,And one can reify
those,as a goal state.
12680.05,There's a concept in Buddhism
that,I think is useful.
12683.16,It doesn't translate
well,"to English,"
12686.52,or it can set up false
associations,in English
12691.29,that are unfortunate.
12692.28,But so there's a concept of
emptiness,"in Buddhism, which"
12696.99,"sounds, again, gray and"
dispiriting,"in English,"
12699.63,but it's cognate terms are
things,"like unconditioned,"
12712.15,"unconstrained, open, centralist."
12721.81,When I'm talking
about,"non duality,"
12723.4,when I'm talking about the
loss,of a sense of subject
12726.19,and then what's
"left,","in Buddhism,"
12728.41,they would often describe
what's,left as emptiness.
12730.84,But an emptiness
is,not a something.
12735.88,"Importantly, it's not"
the,"same thing as unity,"
12739.69,so it's not a oneness
because,it's--
12746.13,When the center drops
out,"of experience,"
12748.86,it's not like you are
suddenly,merged with the cup.
12754.65,"Now, granted, this is"
where,psilocybin and other
12758.91,psychedelics can give
a,false impression of I
12762.54,think what the goal is.
12763.83,You can have seeming
merging,experiences--
12767.1,you can have unity experiences
on,"psychedelics, which"
12770.04,"can be quite powerful,"
especially,with other people
12774.312,"and with nature,"
where,you can just
12775.77,feel the energy of
your,body becomes
12785.27,incredibly vivid and powerful.
12787.31,It's like everything is just
buzzing,with life energy.
12792.41,And then when you touch
another,person's hand
12795.32,or you touch a
"tree,",there can be
12798.41,this continuity of
"energy,",which can be
12801.38,this overwhelming experience.
12803.53,"And again, this is"
a,20 megaton change
12807.95,in the contents
of,consciousness.
12809.78,This is a non ordinary
state,of consciousness.
12814.76,To give some indication
of,how this happens--
12819.05,back in the day
when,I was in my 20s
12822.44,and I was experimenting with--
12824.09,"this was LSD, but"
some,friends and I
12827.212,had decided-- we had
this,brilliant idea.
12828.92,We would camp above Muir woods
and,then take some LSD at dawn
12834.38,and then walk down like a
mile,I think from the campsite
12838.19,into the actual
proper,grove of trees
12841.28,and commune with the giant
"redwoods,",the tallest
12844.4,trees on Earth.
12846.285,And so we dropped the acid at
"dawn,","and we start walking,"
12848.66,but the acid came on
almost,immediately.
12851.21,And we didn't get--
12852.08,"I mean, we got nowhere"
near,"the woods,"
12853.73,and we got stopped by
a,tree that was just
12855.98,like an ordinary
20,"foot oak tree,"
12858.823,the most boring
tree,in the world.
12860.24,And that tree absorbed
the,next six hours
12863.09,of our conscious attention
because,it was just--
12866.12,it was the tree of life.
12867.17,"I mean, there could"
be,no better tree.
12870.26,So we're talking about
nonordinary,states
12872.15,of consciousness wherein
a,merging with life
12876.86,and with the world is possible.
12881.72,So I'm not saying that kind
of,"experience isn't possible,"
12885.09,but there's a sort of
expanded,self reification.
12891.5,"It is a kind of ego dissolution,"
but,there's a kind of egoity
12896.45,that goes along for
the,"ride as well,"
12899.48,or can go along for the ride.
12900.86,And the real insight into
"emptiness,",the real centerless
12906.29,center of the bull's eye is a
recognition,that in some ways
12912.86,equalizes all experiences.
12914.72,"And again, it's just"
as,available now
12917.57,in this ordinary
podcasting,experience
12921.29,as it is when you're merging
hands,"on with an oak tree,"
12926.57,"and on 400 micrograms of acid,"
and,this is the whole universe.
12935.04,And so it's the equality
of,those two experiences
12940.58,that this concept of
emptiness,"captures, which"
12943.7,a concept of oneness doesn't
quite,capture because oneness
12947.09,is really this peak experience
of,being dragged out
12950.81,of your somethingness into
a,much bigger somethingness.
12955.79,Emptiness is just
no,center and then
12959.09,everything is in its own place.
12961.13,"There's still sights, and"
"sounds,","and sensations,"
12963.83,"and thoughts, and feelings, but"
there's,no there's no center
12967.52,and there's no
clinging,to anything.
12971.51,There's no clinging
to,"identity, there's"
12973.37,no clinging to the good
"stuff,",there's no there's
12975.83,no resistance to the bad stuff.
12978.34,So pleasant and unpleasant
get,"strangely equalized,"
12982.1,and it's very expansive.
12986.24,"And most importantly, it"
doesn't,block anything.
12989.87,"So yeah, if for whatever"
reason,if your nervous system
12992.21,is set up to have
"the,","oh my god, I'm"
12996.17,now merging with the
tree,"experience, that's"
12999.26,possible from the
state,of no center.
13002.38,And on my recent--
13005.11,"now not so recent,"
three,"years ago, it"
13006.955,"was right before COVID,"
but,my last big psychedelic
13011.71,"experience, I was very"
much,experiencing that.
13016.88,"Whereas, insofar as I--"
13020.69,"at the peak, there was no me"
to,remember any of this stuff.
13024.59,But insofar as I could
experiment,with--
13029.6,is this really different
from,anything else?
13031.88,There is a equalizing to
the,"emptiness recognition,"
13036.77,even in the presence of
a,completely transformed
13041.24,neurophysiology.
13044.3,"Again, there's a"
point,of contact.
13046.19,"I mean, the real point of"
contact,between psychedelics
13050.36,and meditation for me is--
13052.46,but for my experiences
on,"psychedelics,"
13054.632,I think there's
just,no way I would
13056.09,have had the free attention to
be,interested in the project
13060.2,at all.
13062.188,And there are other
aspects,to the project.
13063.98,It's not just having this
insight,"into selflessness,"
13067.28,it's all of the ethical
ramifications,of that.
13069.92,"It's just like, what kind"
of,person do you want to be?
13072.17,What are your values?
13074.48,"What is a good life,"
"altogether,",when
13077.18,you are talking
about,"relationships,"
13080.15,"and political engagement,"
and,the changes you can
13083.3,make in the world or not make?
13085.4,"It's just, what kind of"
person,do you want to be?
13087.59,There's a much
larger,consideration.
13090.41,"And I mean, as you discovered,"
an,experience on MDMA
13095.18,can really both expand your
model,"of what is possible,"
13103.33,"and what is desirable,"
what,is normative.
13105.13,"I mean, just what kind of self"
do,you want to be in the world?
13108.67,And it can also help
you,cut through things
13112.93,that are inhibiting
your,actualizing any
13116.26,of those possibilities in
ordinary,waking consciousness.
13119.913,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've certainly
found,that to be the case.
13122.33,"I mean, you raise a really"
important,"point, which"
13125.05,is that once these
learnings,"take place,"
13129.497,these understandings
take,place inside
13131.08,of psychedelic journeys--
13132.94,I do believe they translate
to,neuroplasticity.
13135.31,I do want to highlight
the,point for people.
13137.71,Oftentimes people
"say,","oh, you know,"
13139.96,this mushroom or
this,psychedelic
13144.25,"it opens plasticity, but"
of,"course, plasticity"
13147.01,has to be directed someplace.
13148.33,Plasticity is just a process
like,walking or anything
13151.78,"else, underlying neural process."
13153.68,And I think it's
impossible,for me
13156.04,to understand what
compartments,of my life
13158.44,have been impacted by
these,three MDMA sessions.
13161.87,"But in some ways, I"
wonder,"whether or not,"
13164.967,not just the transition
away,"from animal research,"
13167.05,but also a deeper
realization,of the love
13171.28,for learning and
sharing,information.
13174.04,I won't go so far as
to,say this podcast
13176.11,is happening because of
that,"particular session,"
13179.14,but these things they splay
out,into multiple domains
13182.62,of the self.
13183.25,And I do think that
the,key features that
13186.88,feel most important
to,me to mention
13189.04,are that it really identified
true,"loves, things that I truly"
13194.71,"love, and made me less"
cautious,about feeling
13199.97,how intense those
loves,really are.
13201.92,And then also lowered
the,inhibition point
13206.15,"of exploring, well,"
what,would that mean?
13209.235,And one of the reasons
I,"bring this up,"
13210.86,and why I think it's so
important,that you mentioned
13213.47,some issues around
politics,and ethics
13215.888,and that many things
have,splayed out
13217.43,from your exploration of
"psychedelics,","meditation,"
13220.46,"neuroscience, philosophy,"
all,"the things that are you,"
13223.25,"and of course, that's only"
a,"subset, is that so much"
13227.36,"of what I hear and see, so"
much,of what I hear and see
13231.2,"in the self-help space,"
contradicts,itself and leads
13237.49,back to the origin
without,a lot of progress.
13242.38,"For instance, we"
hear,absence makes
13244.45,the heart grow fonder but then
out,"of sight, out of mind."
13246.94,You hear about
radical,"acceptance,"
13248.92,but then what if it's radical
acceptance,of non acceptance?
13252.303,"I mean, there are"
some,experiences
13253.72,in people for which I radically
accept,the fact that I
13256.42,want nothing to do with them.
13258.88,Am I supposed to transcend that?
13260.4,So these are the questions I
think,that keep a lot of people
13262.9,from exploring things like
meditation,because they
13267.4,"feel like, well, is the idea"
to,just be OK with everything?
13270.61,Is radical acceptance
just,like--
13272.68,we'll just bulldoze me
with,things even if they--
13276.61,and my goal is to
somehow,surpass
13279.46,the idea that they're harmful.
13280.785,And I don't think
that's,actually
13282.16,the way any of this stuff
is,"supposed to work,"
13284.26,although I don't claim to be
the,authority on it either.
13288.22,I think notions of
radical,"acceptance,"
13290.95,"and radical honesty, and any"
number,of different sayings
13294.67,that one can find out there are
really,the most salient beacons
13298.75,and guides that most people have
in,order to try and navigate
13301.63,tough areas in their
"life,",including
13303.88,the relationship
to,"self, but others"
13305.68,and political orientations.
13307.36,And so I feel like
almost,all those things
13309.64,can be used to anchor down in
a,stance that may or may not
13312.52,be informed or to
open,up to ideas.
13316.7,And so I think that
none,of this can really
13320.17,be solved in a single
practice,"it sounds like,"
13322.27,"but it does seem to me, based"
on,"what you've told us today,"
13326.14,is that only through a deep
understanding,of the self
13329.62,"as it really is, as"
opposed,to this illusion
13333.52,"that you framed up,"
could,we actually
13336.82,arrive at some
answers,about what's
13338.41,actually right for each
and,every one of us.
13340.845,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah,"
I,"mean, there's"
13342.22,one generic answer that
I,think can be extracted
13345.88,both from psychedelics
and,from meditation
13350.71,and from just
thinking,more clearly
13352.45,about the nature of our lives.
13354.67,And it's to become
more,"process oriented,"
13359.23,and to be more and more
sensitive,to the mirage
13365.53,like character of
achieving,our goals.
13369.91,"Now, I'm not against"
achieving,goals.
13371.83,I have a lot of goals.
13373.66,I'm very busy.
13374.257,There are lots of things
I,"want to get done,"
13376.09,and I'm satisfied as
anyone,to finish a project.
13381.13,But if you look at
the,time course of all
13384.16,of that fulfillment and--
13388.84,there are a few lessons
everyone,I think has to draw.
13391.18,"One is, most of your life"
is,spent in the process.
13395.47,The moment at which the goal is
fully,"conquered, that is just--"
13400.75,"I mean, that has"
a,"tiny duration,"
13404.44,and it has a very
short,half life.
13410.53,The moment you arrive
at,"it, it begins"
13413.89,"to recede because,"
in,"the meantime,"
13415.97,you have all these
other,goals that
13417.43,have appeared on the horizon.
13419.2,You've got people asking
what,"you're going to do next,"
13422.08,"and in some sense, if"
you're,"focused on goals,"
13426.94,you can never arrive.
13429.19,And I think what we're
all,"looking for in life,"
13437.15,whether we're ever
thinking,about taking
13439.45,psychedelics or practicing
something,"like meditation,"
13443.83,we're looking for
good,enough reasons
13447.22,to let our attention
fully,rest in the present.
13453.61,That is the logic of success.
13456.97,"The sense like, I've got all"
these,things I want to do--
13459.49,if I could just get rich
"enough,","or fit enough,"
13461.92,"or dial in my sleep well enough,"
or,improve my life in all
13465.45,"of these ways, get the"
right,"relationship,"
13467.2,wouldn't it be
great,"to be married,"
13468.85,"I want to start a family,"
I,want all of these things.
13473.39,Why do I want these things?
13475.33,I want these things because
I'm,telling myself--
13478.96,all of those things
are,"wonderful,"
13480.64,I'm not I'm not discounting
those,relative forms
13483.43,of happiness or
sources,of happiness
13486.01,because it's all
completely,"valid,"
13487.57,it's completely valid
to,want those things.
13489.362,But one thing is
absolutely,"clear,"
13494.2,it's possible to be miserable
in,the presence of all
13497.2,of those things.
13498.4,"And you can add great wealth,"
and,"fame, and everything"
13501.79,"on top of that, and It's"
possible,to be absolutely
13504.13,miserable having everything
anyone,could seemingly want.
13509.267,You just have to
open,a newspaper just
13510.85,to see people living
out,that predicament--
13513.61,"spectacularly wealthy, famous,"
"healthy,",successful people
13517.6,who could do anything they
want,"in life, apparently,"
13520.06,and yet they're
doing,this thing that
13522.16,is completely dysfunctional
and,making them needlessly
13524.77,miserable.
13526.24,"I won't name names,"
13527.77,ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's
enough,of them out there.
13528.61,SAM HARRIS: Some people
come,to mind at the moment.
13533.64,So there is a clear dissociation
between,having everything
13538.77,and happiness that's possible.
13540.75,And it's also possible to
have,"very little, and almost"
13544.5,"nothing, and to be quite happy."
13546.75,"I mean, you might not"
have,"met these people,"
13549.06,but I have met people who have
spent,10 years alone in a cave.
13554.78,And they come out of
that,cave not floridly
13557.39,"neurotic or psychotic,"
they,come out
13559.34,of that cave beaming
with,compassion and joy.
13562.28,"And I mean, they've been taking"
MDMA,"for 10 years, essentially,"
13565.52,and they come out
of,the cave and now
13567.38,they're going to talk about it.
13570.86,And I'm not necessarily
recommending,that project
13572.94,to anyone.
13573.44,"I'm just saying, that is a"
psychological,possibility.
13575.96,So you have a double
dissociation,"here,"
13577.73,whether you can have
everything,"and be miserable,"
13579.772,or you can have nothing and
be,beaming with happiness.
13584.1,So what is it that we actually
want,in all of our seeking
13587.69,to arrange the
props,in our lives
13589.91,and to have a
convincing,enough story
13593.96,to tell about ourselves that
we're,doing the right thing?
13597.74,What is all of that
effort,predicated on?
13600.5,It's predicated on this
desire,and this expectation
13606.35,that if we could get all of
this,stuff in the right place
13610.88,and not have anything
terrifying,"to worry about,"
13613.79,everyone we love is healthy for
the,"moment, and we're healthy,"
13617.06,and we've got something to
look,"forward to on the weekend,"
13619.77,and there's not a
plumbing,leak in the house
13623.625,that we have to
immediately,"respond to,"
13625.25,"and we like our house, and"
our,"career is going fine,"
13628.94,and there's something
good,"to watch on Netflix,"
13631.29,"and we have all of it, now"
can,we just actually give
13636.79,up the war?
13637.83,Can we fully locate
our,sense of wellbeing
13642.76,in the present moment?
13644.41,Can we relax the impulse
to,brood about the past
13649.27,or think anxiously about
the,future for long enough
13652.84,to discover that all
of,this here is enough?
13657.25,Because our life our life is--
13660.79,we have this finite
resource,of--
13663.76,"I mean, we absolutely have"
the,"finite resource of time,"
13666.86,but within this the
finite,"continuum of time,"
13671.08,we have the even more
precious,resource
13673.36,of free attention that can find
our,fulfillment in the present.
13684.76,Because even if we're even
if,we're guarding our time
13687.55,to do the things that
are,"most important to us,"
13690.02,we can spend all of that
time,"regretting the past,"
13695.64,or anxiously
expecting,"the future,"
13699.51,and just bouncing
between,past and future
13702.54,in our thinking about
ourselves,"and our lives,"
13704.73,and basically just
dancing,over the present
13708.0,and never making
contact,with it.
13709.83,So I think what we want
is,a circumstance where
13715.78,a tension can be located in the
present,in a way that's truly
13718.9,fulfilling.
13719.41,And unless you have had
some,kind of radical insight
13723.92,that allows you to
do,"that on demand,"
13727.71,you are in some sense hostage to
the,circumstances of your life
13733.26,to do that for you.
13734.86,You're constantly
trying,to engineer
13737.94,a state of the world
that,will propagate back
13741.12,on a state of self
that,will make
13743.58,the present moment good enough.
13745.41,"And what meditation does, and"
psychedelics,to some degree
13749.25,"does this, but meditation"
very,"directly does this,"
13752.91,it reverses the causality
and,lets you actually
13758.37,change state such that
you,can be fulfilled
13761.19,before anything happens.
13764.01,Your happiness is
no,longer predicated
13766.11,on the next good
thing,happening.
13768.1,You can be in the presence
of,the next good or bad thing
13771.0,already being fulfilled
and,already being at peace.
13775.07,"I mean, there's a--"
13778.753,I think there are
misleading,nouns
13780.17,we can throw at
what,"is left there,"
13782.12,"but it is tranquility, peace,"
"freedom,","lack of contraction,"
13790.34,lack of conflict.
13791.24,"I mean, all of that can be"
more,and more of a default.
13794.88,And all of that is also
compatible,"with deciding, yeah,"
13799.16,why not get in shape?
13800.66,Why not engage this project?
13802.58,Why not change your career?
13804.89,"I mean, it's not it's not that"
you,need to be somebody who--
13808.76,"I mean, to your"
"point,",you can notice
13811.07,all of these non optimal
things,because no matter
13813.32,"how much you meditate,"
you're,very likely going
13817.16,to spend a lot of your time
still,"lost in thought, still"
13821.54,"identified with it,"
and,still caring
13824.75,about the difference between
dysfunction,and normativity
13829.533,in your life.
13832.64,"The question is, what can you"
what,can you locate when--
13838.86,"the question, it's"
"like,",how much can you
13841.92,puncture that seeking happiness
project,with the recognition
13848.4,that you're already free?
13851.94,That's what meditation
makes,possible.
13853.98,You can keep just
"1,000",times a day
13857.37,letting some daylight
into,this search space.
13861.81,But it is still compatible.
13864.45,"I mean, working out"
is,a great frame
13869.67,in which to look at
this,"because, I mean,"
13872.01,"in working out, when"
you,really work out--
13874.95,I'm thinking mostly of--
13876.397,"I mean, it's really"
"anything,",but it's
13877.98,"resistance training, or cardio,"
or,something like jujitsu.
13881.73,You're intentionally
putting,yourself
13884.13,in classically unpleasant
"circumstances,",physiologically.
13888.93,"I mean, imagine what it's like"
to,do anything to failure.
13897.25,"Well, if you just"
check,in on what
13899.05,that is like at the level
of,"sensation, I mean,"
13901.45,that is basically-- it feels
like,a medical emergency.
13904.93,If you were having
that,experience
13906.45,"for some other reason,"
like,if you woke up
13908.2,in the middle of
the,night and felt
13909.82,what it feels like
to,be deadlifting
13912.28,on your 10th rep on a set
where,"you would fail at 11,"
13920.32,that's an emergency.
13922.247,But because you understand
what,"you're doing in the gym,"
13924.58,and you've sought
"out,",and it's actually
13926.8,"something you like doing, and"
you,can get a real dopamine hit
13932.62,"from doing it, what"
you're,doing when you're
13939.76,doing that is you're owning a--
13942.88,you're actually transforming a
classically,negative experience
13951.62,into something that's almost
intrinsically,"positive,"
13954.95,certainly the net
on,it is positive.
13960.56,Being able to do
that,is more and more
13963.08,the experience of being
actually,"at peace,"
13967.76,even while exerting
really,intense effort
13970.91,in one direction.
13972.18,"So you can be straining, and"
I'm,sure physiologically showing
13976.94,"a lot of stress, I mean,"
I'm,"sure the cortisol is up,"
13979.7,"and blood pressure's up,"
heart,rate is certainly up.
13985.28,"So it's like, as far as the"
body,"is concerned, it's stress"
13989.447,as far as the eye can see.
13990.53,But you really can
be,deeply equanimous
13993.95,"and at peace, again, because"
of,"the frame around it,"
13996.795,because of the concepts
attached,"to it,"
13998.42,because you know
what,"you're doing,"
13999.878,you know why it's
"happening,",and you want it.
14003.31,So that's an attitude
you,can bring
14005.62,into other stressful things
that,take effort to accomplish.
14009.78,And so it's not
that,you just need
14011.41,to be a pushover when you
learn,"how to meditate,"
14014.32,"or when you take MDMA, or"
work,on yourself in any
14017.647,of these ways.
14018.23,But what I think
you,want to find
14022.74,is you want to find
your,point of rest
14025.65,in the midst of any struggle.
14029.307,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I would
say,"that, certainly"
14031.14,"MDMA but, and again, I have"
less,"experience with meditation,"
14036.03,but they really I think
put,"us, ultimately,"
14038.34,in positions of what can only
refer,to as real strength.
14041.58,These can make
what,before seemed
14043.8,like impossible
"decisions,",or even
14046.23,concepts or emotional
states,to even think
14048.81,about for any period of
time,without deliberately
14051.51,distracting or avoiding
in,some other way
14053.95,and be able to lean into
those,with open eyes.
14058.53,To me that's my
definition,of strength.
14060.463,I don't know what
other,people consider.
14062.13,But there's definitely something
real,there in each case.
14070.14,This may seem like a divergence
but,I and many other people
14074.25,are very curious about a
recent,"decision that you made,"
14077.41,which was to close your
account,on Twitter.
14084.26,You still have an Instagram
account,I noticed.
14087.81,"SAM HARRIS: I mean,"
my,team manages that.
14089.57,I've never--
14090.26,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a lot
friendlier,over at Instagram.
14091.94,I've been there a lot longer--
14092.75,SAM HARRIS: I've
never,even seen it.
14094.05,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, it's"
pretty,"good actually,"
14095.43,considering-- imagine
what,would happen
14097.055,if you did pay attention.
14098.24,They're doing a
good,job with it.
14100.59,But your decision to close
your,account on Twitter I think
14104.21,grabbed a lot of eyes
and,"ears, and there's"
14106.79,a lot of questions about why.
14108.17,It was a very large account.
14111.41,It correlated with a number of
things,"that, for the outsider,"
14114.32,people might be wondering
about,"new leadership, people"
14120.29,"who had been booted off, brought"
back,"on, or at least invited"
14123.56,"back on, and so on."
14126.05,You are certainly not obligated
to,explain your behavior
14129.56,to me or anybody
else,for that matter.
14133.58,But I'm curious if you
might,share with us
14137.96,what the motivation was for
taking,"the account down,"
14141.5,and how you feel
in,the absence of--
14144.32,"I mean, your thumbs"
presumably,are freed up
14147.53,to do other things.
14148.598,"SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I was"
getting,like an arthritic right
14150.89,"thumb I think, and I think it--"
14152.72,ANDREW HUBERMAN: If
you,"don't mind sharing,"
14153.68,I think there's a
lot,of curiosity
14155.27,about you and your routines.
14157.64,You've been very generous
in,"sharing your knowledge,"
14161.93,but also what makes
you,"tick, what"
14165.83,motivates pretty big
decisions,like that?
14168.42,It was a major platform for you.
14170.36,"SAM HARRIS: Right, yeah, so"
it,was the only social media
14173.39,platform I've ever engaged.
14174.95,"I mean, like you said,"
I,"have an Instagram,"
14177.71,I have a Facebook
"account,",but I've never
14180.86,used those as platforms.
14182.18,"I was never on them, I've"
never,followed people.
14185.81,All the posting has
just,come from--
14187.4,it's just marketing
from,my team.
14191.18,"But Twitter was me, I"
"mean,","for better or worse,"
14193.98,and I began to feel
more,and more for worse.
14197.54,And it was interesting
because,it was very--
14202.1,I've talked about it
a,"lot of my podcast,"
14205.13,about my love/hate relationship
with,Twitter over the years.
14208.7,Many good things came
to,"me from Twitter,"
14211.58,and I was following a
lot,of smart people.
14214.07,And it had become my newsfeed
and,my first point of contact
14219.17,with information each day.
14221.21,And I was really attached to it
just,"for that reason, just as"
14223.85,a consumer of content.
14228.38,And then it was also a
place,where I genuinely
14231.35,wanted to communicate with
people,and react to things.
14234.68,And I would see some article
that,"I thought was great,"
14237.53,and I would signal boost
it,to the people following
14241.76,me on Twitter.
14242.4,"And that was rewarding,"
and,I could literally
14245.51,help people on Twitter.
14246.74,"I mean, there are people who"
have,raised lots of money
14251.39,for on Twitter just by signal
boosting,their GoFundMe's.
14254.39,And so I was engaged in a
way,that seemed productive.
14261.1,But I was always worried that it
was,producing needless conflict
14267.0,for me and was giving
me,a signal in my life
14271.38,that I was being lured into
responding,to and taking
14275.79,seriously that was
out,of proportion
14278.19,to its representation of any
opinion,or set of opinions
14282.63,that I should be
taking,seriously.
14285.09,So I was noticing that--
14287.22,"and again, this"
evolved,"over years,"
14288.69,"I mean, this long predated"
recent,"changes to Twitter,"
14297.86,but I was noticing that many
of,the worst things that
14301.97,had happened for
me,professionally
14304.19,were first born on Twitter.
14306.02,"I mean, just like some conflict"
I,"got into with somebody,"
14309.14,or something that I felt like
I,needed to podcast about
14311.87,in response to on Twitter.
14315.5,"Just so much of it, either"
it's,"genesis was Twitter,"
14318.68,or it's the further spin of it
that,became truly unpleasant
14326.18,and dysfunctional
happened,on Twitter.
14327.8,It was just-- Twitter was
part,of the story when
14329.84,it got really bad.
14331.07,And I've had vacations
that,have gone sideways
14335.058,just because I got on
Twitter,"and said something,"
14337.1,and then I had
produced,a controversy
14338.93,that I had to
respond,"to, and then"
14340.347,I had to do a
podcast,about that.
14342.53,"And it was just, this is a mess."
14345.05,And so at that
"point,",I have friends
14349.34,who also had big
Twitter,platforms who
14351.92,would say why are you responding
to,anything on Twitter?
14356.24,Just tweet and ghost.
14359.96,Joe Rogan--
14360.71,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Yeah,",post and ghost.
14360.92,SAM HARRIS: sat me down and
tried,to give me a talking
14363.95,"to, as did Bill Maher."
14366.95,And both of them engage
Twitter,in that way.
14368.85,"I mean, I think they"
basically,never look
14370.558,at their ad mentions.
14371.66,They never see whats
coming,back at them.
14373.9,"They use it effectively, the"
way,"I use, or don't even, use"
14377.12,Instagram or Facebook.
14378.18,"I mean, I don't even see what's"
going,out there in my name.
14381.71,And so I could essentially
do,that for myself
14384.32,"on Twitter, presumably."
14385.61,And I did that for
some,"periods of time,"
14388.91,but then I would
continually,"decide, OK,"
14391.94,now it's all balanced
"again,",maybe I
14393.74,can just communicate here
because,it was very tempting
14396.65,for me to communicate
with,people
14398.03,because I would see
somebody,clearly
14401.32,misunderstanding something
I,"had said on my podcast,"
14404.54,"and I think, why not clarify"
this,misunderstanding?
14409.64,And my efforts to do that
almost,invariably produced a--
14417.65,sometimes it was a meandering
process,of discovery.
14422.39,"But often, it was just"
a,stark confrontation
14425.84,with what appeared to me to
be,just lunacy and malevolence
14430.79,on a scale that I'd never
encounter,elsewhere in my life.
14434.09,I'd never meet these
people,"in life,"
14437.24,and yet I was meeting these
people,by the tens of thousands
14441.35,on Twitter.
14441.98,And so the thing that began
to,worry me about it--
14446.8,"and again, I"
understand,that people
14448.3,have the opposite experience.
14450.967,"I mean, depending on"
what,you're putting out
14452.8,and the kinds of
topics,"you're touching,"
14455.41,you could have just
nothing,but love
14457.06,coming back at you on Twitter.
14459.4,But because I am very--
14462.52,"essentially, in the"
"center,","politically,"
14464.26,and because this is
now,"on my podcast,"
14467.11,this is not in
the,Waking Up app.
14469.57,I'm often criticizing
the,far left
14472.57,and criticizing the far right.
14474.88,I'm basically pissing off
everyone,some of the time.
14478.27,"It's different, if you're"
only,"criticizing the left,"
14483.04,no doubt you get
hate,"from the left,"
14484.84,but you have all the people on
the,right who just reflexively
14488.5,and tribally are expressing
their,"solidarity for you,"
14493.69,and who are dunking on
your,enemies for you
14497.47,and when your enemies
come,out of the woodwork.
14500.92,And if you're only
criticizing,"the right,"
14503.518,you get a lot of
pain,"from the right,"
14505.06,but you've got the people
on,the left who are tribally
14507.31,identified with the
"left,",who are just going
14509.44,to reflexively defend you.
14511.72,If you're in the center
criticizing,the left as hard
14515.56,as anyone on the right
ever,"criticizes the left,"
14519.4,and you're also criticizing
the,right as hard
14522.37,as anyone on the left
criticizes,"the right,"
14525.07,you're getting hate from
both,"sides all the time,"
14527.56,and no one is
reflexively,and tribally
14531.31,defending you because you
pissed,them off last time.
14534.037,You might be getting
hate,"from the left now,"
14535.87,and the people on the
right,agree with you
14537.73,but they can't forget the
thing,you said about Trump
14539.95,on that podcast
two,"podcasts ago,"
14543.31,so they're not
going,to defend you.
14545.0,And so I basically
created,hell for myself
14548.8,on Twitter because it
was,just a theater of--
14554.34,it was just pure cacophony
most,of the time.
14557.35,And what I was seeing was--
14560.31,"I mean, there's no way"
there's,this many psychopaths
14563.82,"in the world, but I was"
seeing,psychopaths everywhere.
14566.07,I was seeing the most
malicious,"dishonesty, and just"
14571.65,"goalpost moving, and hypocrisy."
14576.025,"I mean, some of it's"
"trolling,",and some
14577.65,"of it's real confusion, and"
some,"of it is psychopathy,"
14579.99,"but it's like, it was"
so,dark that I worried
14586.13,that it was actually giving me
a,very negative and sticky view
14594.17,of humanity that was--
14597.71,"I mean, one, I think it"
is,"inaccurate, but two,"
14602.24,it was something that I
was,returning to so much
14605.54,"because, again, I was checking"
Twitter,at least a dozen times
14609.562,"a day, and I'm sure there were"
some,days where I checked it
14612.02,100 times a day.
14612.87,"I mean, it was, again, it was"
my,main source of information.
14615.37,I was constantly reading
articles,and then
14617.78,putting my own stuff out.
14621.158,That it became this
kind,of fun house
14622.7,mirror in which I was looking
at,the most grotesque side
14625.7,of humanity and
feeling,implicated
14632.99,in ways that were
important,because it
14635.99,"was reputationally important,"
or,seem to be important.
14640.62,I know a lot of these people.
14642.35,These weren't just
faceless,"trolls,"
14644.15,these are people with whom
I,have had relationships
14647.72,and in some cases
"friendships,",who
14650.21,"because of what, largely,"
Trump,and COVID did
14654.29,to our political landscape in
the,"last half a dozen years,"
14659.63,we're beginning to
act,in ways that
14662.87,seemed starkly dishonest
and,crazy making to me.
14667.28,So I was just noticing that I
was,forming a view of people
14671.0,who I actually have had
dinner,with that was
14673.55,"way more negative, based"
on,"their Twitter behavior,"
14677.34,then I think would ever be
justified,by any way they would
14680.33,behave in life with me.
14682.73,"I mean, I was never going to"
have,a face-to-face encounter
14686.36,with any of these
people,that was
14688.49,"this malicious, and"
"dishonest,","and gaslighting,"
14692.06,and weird as what was
happening,hourly on Twitter.
14697.73,And so I just began
to,become more
14700.34,sensitive to what this was--
14705.8,just the residue of
all,"of this in my life,"
14708.38,and just how often the
worst,thing about me
14713.263,in my relationship with
the,"people in my life,"
14715.18,like just talking to
my,"wife or my kids,"
14717.43,was just the fact that I had
been,on Twitter at some point
14721.72,in the previous hour.
14724.52,And there was some
residue,of that
14728.125,in my interaction with them.
14729.798,"It's like, what are"
you,stressed out about?
14731.59,What are you annoyed about?
14732.715,What are you pissed off about?
14734.44,What can't you get
out,of your head?
14737.32,What is the thing
that,you now feel
14739.06,like you need to spend
the,next week of your life
14741.55,focused on because it
went,so sideways for you?
14745.87,All of that was Twitter.
14748.63,"I mean, literally 100%"
of,that was Twitter.
14750.59,"And so I just, at one point,"
it,was actually on Thanksgiving
14754.69,"day, I just looked"
at,this and I just--
14756.67,"I mean, there was very"
little,thought went into it.
14759.14,"I mean, literally,"
there,was more
14761.59,thought involved in whether I
wanted,coffee when you asked me
14766.133,when I showed up here.
14767.05,"I mean it was just like,"
at,a certain point I just I
14769.217,"just saw it, and I just"
ripped,the Band-Aid off.
14773.223,And to answer your
other,"question,"
14774.64,it's been almost
wholly,"positive,"
14777.94,as you might expect given the
litany,of pain and discomfort
14781.97,I just ran through.
14782.86,"But I mean, it's"
surprising,to recognize
14789.47,how much of a presence
it,was in my life
14793.07,given the sense of
what,is now missing.
14795.68,"I mean, there's no"
question,there's
14799.73,an addictive component to it.
14801.02,And when you see--
14801.77,"I mean, like when"
I,look at what Elon
14803.312,"is doing on Twitter, forget"
about,his ownership of it--
14807.32,I've got a lot to
say,about the choices
14810.56,"he's making for the platform,"
but,just his personal use of it
14815.0,is just so obviously
an,expression of--
14818.095,"I mean, I don't"
know,if addiction
14819.47,is the clinically
appropriate,"term,"
14824.24,but his dysfunctional attachment
to,using the platform.
14831.52,"Again, forget about changing"
it,"and owning it, but just"
14835.61,the degree to which it
is,pointlessly disrupting
14839.3,the life of one of the
most,productive people
14842.06,in any generation.
14848.09,That was also instructive
to,"me because I know Elon,"
14850.85,and from a friend's eye
view,"of the situation,"
14858.65,it's so obviously
not,good for him
14861.2,that he's spending this
much,time on Twitter.
14865.13,I just brought that back to me.
14866.75,"It's like, well, if"
it's,not-- if this
14868.34,is what it's doing
to,"Elon, and he's"
14869.84,got all these other
things,he could
14871.298,"be doing with his attention,"
how,much of my use of Twitter
14874.91,is actually a good idea and
optimize,to my well-being
14878.96,and the well-being of
the,people around me?
14882.36,"So anyway, there was an"
addictive,component to it I
14885.53,"think, and so when"
that,"got stripped off,"
14889.61,I do notice that there's--
14891.92,"I mean, there are times"
I,pick up my phone
14894.47,and I realize this is
like,the old me picking it
14896.63,up my phone for a reason that
no,longer exists because there's
14899.54,not that much--
14900.89,I have a Slack
channel,"with my team,"
14902.39,"and I've got email,"
"obviously,",but it's
14904.97,"like, that is not much of"
what,I was doing with my phone
14909.05,really in the end.
14910.07,And so it's just my
phone,is much less
14912.5,of a presence in my life.
14913.65,And so it's almost
wholly,"good, but yeah,"
14919.61,I think there is
some,danger in--
14923.08,or some possible
danger,in losing touch
14927.07,with certain aspects of
"culture,","which, again, I'm"
14929.17,not even sure--
14929.92,"I mean, there's this question of"
how,"much is Twitter real life,"
14932.545,and how much is it
just,a mass delusion?
14935.14,I don't know.
14936.28,But insofar as it
actually,matters
14938.59,what happens on
"Twitter,",or insofar
14942.73,as I was actually getting
a,news diet which I'm not
14945.43,going to be able to
recapitulate,"for myself,"
14947.59,or I'm just not in fact going
to,recapitulate for myself even
14951.37,"if I could, if any"
of,"that matters,"
14954.64,I haven't discovered that yet.
14956.86,"I mean, it was taking up an"
immense,amount of bandwidth
14959.98,and it's impressive.
14961.06,"I think I said, it was like"
I,amputated a phantom limb.
14967.27,"It was not a real limb, but it"
was,this continuous presence
14970.69,in my life that--
14975.81,"it's weird, it actually"
relates,to the concept
14978.06,of self in surprising
ways,because I
14980.31,felt there was a part of
myself,that existed on Twitter.
14985.62,And I just performed a
suicide,of that self.
14989.31,This is ending right
"now,","there's no residue,"
14992.52,there's nothing to go
back,"and check, it's gone."
14995.43,And I didn't go back
and,look at my--
14998.4,what's interesting to
consider,is that I'd
15000.32,been on Twitter for 12 years.
15003.58,I don't keep a journal.
15004.69,"I mean, Twitter, in"
my,timeline would
15006.643,have been a kind of journal.
15007.81,I could have gone back
to,a specific hour
15009.52,and a specific day and looked at
what,I was paying attention to.
15011.84,"I mean, that could have"
been,an interesting record
15013.923,of just who I've
been,"for a decade,"
15015.4,and probably a pretty
humbling,record of who I've
15018.31,been for a decade in terms
of,the kinds of things
15021.73,that captivated my attention.
15026.525,I didn't even think to
go,nostalgically just
15029.96,"look at any of that,"
or,see if any of it
15031.64,"was worth saving, or"
"archiving,",or thinking--
15033.71,I just-- delete.
15039.83,And so my actual sense of
who,I am and my engagement
15043.79,"with my audience, the world of"
people,who could potentially
15050.5,know me.
15051.28,What does it mean
to,have a platform?
15054.46,"Where do I exist, digitally?"
15056.8,My sense of all of
that,got truncated
15061.3,in a way that is
much,less noisy.
15067.31,"I mean, it's amazing"
how,much can't
15071.05,get fucked up now in my life.
15073.51,"It's like with Twitter,"
almost,anything could happen.
15078.78,The next tweet was
always,an opportunity
15081.48,to massively complicate my life.
15083.88,There is no analogous
space,for me now.
15086.8,And so it's what I'm going
to,"say on your podcast, what"
15089.16,I'm going to say on
my,"own podcast, what"
15090.827,I'm going to write next.
15092.37,That's much more deliberative
and,the opportunities
15101.63,to take my foot out of my mouth
or,to reconsider whether any
15105.56,of this is worth it.
15106.85,Is this the Hill I really
want,to die on now.
15111.5,It can be much more considered.
15114.56,"I mean, I think all"
of,that's to the good.
15117.39,But even more important
than,that is there's not--
15121.38,I'm not getting this
continuous,signal
15123.99,that is always
inviting,"a response,"
15126.49,"whether on Twitter, or on my"
own,"podcast, or anywhere else."
15131.92,And it's just much less noisy.
15135.3,"I mean, life is much"
less,noisy and cluttered.
15138.96,And that definitely
feels,better.
15143.25,That's 100% better.
15144.893,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
happy,to hear that.
15146.56,I know a number of people miss
you,"there, but you sound happy."
15150.84,I sense the genuine happiness.
15152.43,And several things
come,to mind--
15155.47,"first of all, thank you for"
sharing,your rationale there
15158.97,and how it went.
15159.637,I think for a lot of
people,"they think,"
15161.262,"oh, you must have walked"
around,in circles for hours
15163.53,talking about whether
it,"was delete,"
15165.6,as many good decisions
are,executed.
15170.34,I'm a big fan of Cal
Newport's,"work, deep work."
15172.83,"In many ways, Cal's--"
15174.45,"I've never met him,"
but,we know each other
15176.58,through the internet space.
15178.23,He's really ahead of his time
with,this notion of deep work
15181.92,and limiting distractions.
15183.82,I think he's even got
a,book about a world
15185.85,without email or
"something,",really extreme.
15188.013,"SAM HARRIS: So I mean,"
he,deserves some credit
15189.93,because he had been somewhat
a,proximate cause to this.
15193.17,He had been on my
"podcast,",and he
15194.82,had encouraged me
to,delete Twitter
15198.24,because I had been I had been
reaching,some kind of crisis
15203.94,point with it prior
to,that podcast
15206.04,and so we talked about it.
15207.21,And I had recorded that
podcast,but hadn't released it.
15210.75,I actually recorded
the,podcast the day
15212.64,before I wound up
deleting,"Twitter,"
15214.882,but I hadn't yet released it.
15216.09,So in my podcast with
"him,","in the intro to it,"
15218.85,I then give a post-mortem
on,my deleting it.
15222.03,But he was one of the
last,people who was
15224.46,in my head around these issues.
15226.54,"And actually, it"
was,not by accident
15228.51,I had invited him on the
podcast,because I increasingly
15231.18,wanted to think about whether
this,was totally dysfunctional.
15234.863,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm"
a,big fan of Cal Newport.
15237.03,And I am on social media.
15238.99,I'm on Twitter.
15239.7,I had some high-friction
interactions,"there,"
15243.84,and I have a process
for,dealing with those.
15246.33,I tend to avoid high-friction
confrontations,online.
15249.93,But Instagram is a much
friendlier,place by the way.
15253.12,If you want to come over
to,where the nice kids--
15255.49,the cool kids
actually,hang out--
15257.557,"SAM HARRIS: Strangely, I'm"
not,looking for a substitute.
15261.993,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Don't let
me,entice you over there.
15264.16,But I think that
this,notion of really
15266.91,being able to access what
Cal,"calls deep work, what"
15271.5,Rick Rubin talks about
being,able to touch
15274.5,the source of great creativity
and,"focus on a regular basis,"
15278.25,does require that one
have,"certain types of,"
15281.46,"and in some cases,"
zero,interaction
15283.26,with certain platforms.
15285.0,That merely being on a
platform,and blocking
15287.7,people that just won't provide.
15289.11,I think a lot of
energy,opens up.
15290.625,And I'm fascinated by
this,concept of energy.
15292.5,"I mean, we only"
have,"so much energy,"
15294.27,"neural energy, to devote."
15297.27,And in many ways
what,"you described,"
15299.64,there's really I think
striking,parallels
15301.74,to what we've been talking about
all,"along these last hours,"
15304.9,which is that sometimes
the,thing that
15307.02,"feels so powerful, that has"
such,"a gravitational pull,"
15311.4,and that we think this is
"experience,","this is life,"
15313.72,"this is just the way it is,"
actually,is an illusion.
15316.29,And when you step
away,"from it, you"
15318.3,realize that there's this whole
other,dimension of interactions
15321.42,that was available all along but
that,"we, for whatever reason,"
15326.94,were intervening in by way
of,"our reflexive, distracted"
15329.91,behavior.
15330.58,So I think there's
a,poetry there.
15332.79,SAM HARRIS: I was a
hard,"case, but yeah, I"
15335.46,"got religion on this point,"
and,it's a good change.
15339.273,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Well,","Sam, I want"
15340.69,to say a couple of things--
first,"of all, every time"
15346.19,you talk I learn
so,"much, and that's"
15350.81,in the dimensions of
"neuroscience,",even
15352.94,hard core neural circuitry
type,"stuff, which is my home."
15358.4,"When you talk about philosophy,"
or,"meditation, or psychedelics,"
15364.93,"and even politics, a topic that"
I'm,"woefully undereducated in,"
15370.57,but you have this amazing
ability,to blend and synergize
15375.297,across things.
15375.88,"And I think, today,"
what,occurs to me
15377.47,is that not only
is,that no accident
15379.84,because of your
"training,","and the rigor,"
15381.88,and the depth at
which,you've explored
15383.74,"these different topics, but"
also,your openness to it.
15386.71,"But I think, at least"
for,"me, above all"
15389.53,it's because I think you
are,able to encapsulate
15392.56,this idea of the self
and,the different ways
15395.68,in which we each and
all,can potentially
15398.23,interact with the environment
and,our inner landscape.
15403.15,Your description of
"meditation,","I have to say,"
15405.43,now has forever changed the
way,I think about meditation.
15409.46,I would no longer just think
of,it as a perceptual exercise.
15412.08,"On the podcast, I've"
been,talking about it
15413.83,as something to do for these
various,"benefits, the benefit"
15416.86,"set of more focus, lower stress,"
of,which certainly exists.
15420.79,But what you describe
"today,",has such an allure
15425.62,and holds such a promise
"that,","as I mentioned,"
15431.47,I'm certainly going
to,change my behavior.
15433.24,And I know I'm
speaking,on behalf
15434.8,"of many, many"
"people,",when I just
15436.9,want to extend my thanks
for,your coming here today
15440.41,to teach us even more
"because,","of course, you"
15443.53,have your podcast and the
"app,",the Waking Up app.
15447.73,"And the fact that, regardless"
of,"the political landscapes,"
15453.62,regardless of what neuroscience
feels,"about psychedelics,"
15456.83,or where things are
at,"any point in time,"
15459.56,you strike me as somebody who
is,very committed to sharing
15463.64,knowledge and thoughtful
deep,discourse
15466.91,so that people can benefit.
15468.2,And there are very
few,people like you.
15470.86,"In fact, there's"
probably,only just one.
15472.82,And so I feel very
grateful,to be
15474.32,sitting across the table from
him,for these last hours.
15477.155,"SAM HARRIS: Oh, nice, nice."
15478.28,"Well, I really"
enjoyed,"this, and I"
15480.375,want to congratulate
you,on what you've
15482.0,built here because your podcast
is,"everywhere, and I'm a fan."
15487.16,And even more than
"that,",I'm continually
15489.92,seeing the evidence of you
reaching,people and benefiting
15494.06,"people, and this is one of"
the,best examples of new media
15501.38,just carving out a space
that,people didn't really
15505.19,know existed because this is
not,"television, it's not radio,"
15509.54,it's not--
15510.6,"and all of a sudden,"
people,have time
15512.33,to hear a conversation
of,great length
15514.55,that goes into nitty gritty
scientific,detail on hormones.
15520.4,"I mean, who would have thought"
that,was even possible?
15522.66,"And so, yeah, I would"
just--,"congratulations,"
15525.53,it's fantastic to see.
15526.77,And I'm just very happy
for,the opportunity
15529.4,to talk to you and your people.
15530.935,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Well,","thank you,"
15532.31,it's very gratifying to hear.
15533.54,"And I feel very blessed,"
in,no small part because
15537.17,of our conversation today.
15538.61,Thank you so much.
15539.36,"SAM HARRIS: Nice,"
"well,",to be continued.
15540.08,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
