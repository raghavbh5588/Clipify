-,[Andrew] Welcome
1.154,"to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
where,"we discuss science,"
3.437,and science-based tools for everyday life.
9.24,"I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm"
a,professor of neurobiology
11.78,and ophthalmology at
Stanford,School of Medicine.
14.97,"Today, I have the pleasure of"
introducing,the first guest
17.57,of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
19.42,My guest is Dr. Karl Deisseroth.
22.07,"Dr. Karl Deisseroth is a medical doctor,"
24.34,he's a psychiatrist and
a,research scientist
26.9,at Stanford School of Medicine.
28.94,"In his clinical practice, he sees patients"
31.45,dealing with a range of
nervous,"system disorders,"
33.56,including obsessive
compulsive,"disorder, autism,"
37.32,"attention deficit disorders,"
"schizophrenia,","mania,"
41.46,"anxiety disorders, and eating disorders."
44.37,His laboratory develops and explores tools
47.71,with which to understand
how,the nervous system works
50.32,"in the healthy situation,"
51.94,as well as in disorders of the mind.
54.16,Dr. Deisseroth's laboratory
has,pioneered the development
57.35,"and use of what are called channelopsins,"
59.46,"proteins that come from algae,"
61.67,which can now be introduced
to,the nervous systems
64.33,"of animals and humans, in"
order,to precisely control
67.53,the activity of neurons
in,the brain and body
69.81,with the use of light.
71.57,This is a absolutely
transformative,"technology,"
75.03,because whereas certain drug treatments
77.1,can often relieve certain
symptoms,"of disorders,"
79.56,they often carry various side effects.
82.0,"And in some individuals,"
often,"many individuals,"
84.61,these drug treatments simply do not work.
86.92,The channelopsins and their
related,technologies stand
89.67,to transform the way that we
treat,"psychiatric illness,"
92.94,and various disorders of
movement,and perception.
96.36,"In fact, just recently,"
98.08,the channelopsins were
applied,"in a human patient,"
100.87,to allow an adult fully blind
human,"being to see light,"
104.62,for the very first time.
106.1,We also discuss Dr. Deisseroth's
newly,"released book,"
109.22,"which is entitled ""Projections:"
A,"Story of Human Emotions""."
113.0,"This is an absolutely remarkable book,"
115.64,that uses stories about his
interactions,"with his patients,"
119.47,to teach you how the brain works
121.47,"in the healthy and diseased state,"
123.31,and also reveals the
motivation,for and discovery
126.72,of these channelopsins
and,other technologies
129.27,"by Karl's laboratory,"
that,are being used now
132.3,to treat various disorders
of,"the nervous system,"
134.56,"and that in the future,"
136.06,are certain to transform
the,"fields of psychiatry,"
138.73,"mental health, and health in general."
141.02,I found our conversation to be
an,absolutely fascinating one
144.05,about how the brain functions
in,"the healthy state,"
147.23,and why and how it breaks
down,in disorders of the mind.
150.93,We also discuss the
current,status and future
153.73,of psychedelic treatments
for,"psychiatric illness,"
156.73,as well as we're understanding
157.81,how the brain works more generally.
159.81,"We also discuss issues of consciousness,"
162.08,and we even delve into
how,somebody like Karl
165.09,who's managing a full-time
clinical,practice
167.89,"and a 40 plus person laboratory,"
170.32,and a family of five children
and,"is happily married,"
173.38,"how he organizes his internal landscape,"
175.61,his own thinking in order to
manage,that immense workload
179.59,and to progress forward
for,the sake of medicine
182.41,and his pursuits in science.
184.4,I found this to be an
incredible,"conversation,"
186.37,I learned so much.
187.79,"I also learned, through the course"
189.38,"of reading Karl's book, ""Projections"","
191.65,that not only is he an
accomplished,"psychiatrist,"
194.21,and obviously an accomplished
research,scientist
196.99,"and a family man, but he's"
also,a phenomenal writer.
199.747,"""Projections"" is absolutely"
masterfully,written.
202.34,"It's just beautiful, and"
it's,"accessible to anybody,"
205.11,even if you don't have
a,science background.
207.44,"So, I hope that you'll"
enjoy,my conversation
209.9,"with Karl Deisseroth as much as I did,"
212.06,and thank you for tuning in.
213.44,"Before we begin, I want to point out"
215.38,that this podcast is
separate,from my teaching
217.18,and research roles at Stanford.
219.1,In my desire and effort to bring zero cost
221.16,to consumer information about science
222.537,and science related tools
to,"the general public,"
225.06,I'd like to acknowledge the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
228.0,Our first sponsor is Roka.
230.24,Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
232.09,"that in my opinion, are the"
very,highest quality out there.
235.37,The company was founded by
two,All-American swimmers
237.65,"from Stanford, and everything"
about,the eyeglasses
240.2,and sunglasses was developed
with,performance in mind.
243.82,One of the things I really
love,"about Roka sunglasses,"
246.7,is that unlike other sunglasses
that,make it hard to see
249.9,"when there's a lot of cloud cover,"
251.71,or when the shadows change
253.01,"or environmental conditions change,"
254.78,"with Roka sunglasses,"
they,clearly understand
257.41,"the signs of the visual system,"
259.02,because when I put them
on,"for the first time,"
260.86,I noticed that as I moved into shadows
263.25,or the cloud cover changed
or,the day got brighter
265.65,"or dimmer, everything"
was,still crystal clear.
268.52,And that's also because the lenses
270.02,"are tremendously high optical clarity,"
272.57,and the glasses are really lightweight.
274.63,You don't even notice that they're on.
276.63,"The other thing is that the eyeglasses,"
278.18,"I wear readers at night,"
they're,"incredibly lightweight,"
280.8,and for both the
sunglasses,"and eyeglasses,"
282.68,the aesthetic is terrific.
284.45,"Unlike a lot of performance eyewear,"
286.65,which frankly can look kind of cyborg-like
288.83,"and kind of ridiculous, the"
aesthetic,of the glasses
290.84,is such that you could
really,"wear them anywhere,"
293.22,indoors or outdoors.
294.99,"If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses,"
296.68,"you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com,"
299.8,"and enter the code ""Huberman"","
301.4,to save 20% on your first order.
303.65,"That's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,"
306.01,and enter the code
"Huberman,",at checkout.
308.19,Today's podcast is also
brought,to us by InsideTracker.
311.82,InsideTracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
314.19,that analyzes data from
your,"blood and DNA,"
316.92,to help you better understand your body
318.51,and reach your health goals.
320.34,I'm a big believer in getting
regular,blood work done.
323.22,And now with the advent
of,"good genetic DNA tests,"
326.3,I'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA.
329.16,The simple reason for this
is,that many of the factors
331.65,that impact our immediate
and,"longterm health,"
333.92,can only be measured and evaluated
336.03,with a quality blood test.
337.55,"And now, the DNA tests"
further,inform our immediate
340.39,and long-term health.
341.83,One of the problems with a lot
of,DNA tests and blood tests
344.49,"out there however, is that"
you,"get the information back,"
347.17,and you don't know what to
do,with that information.
349.19,"With InsideTracker, you"
get,the numbers back
351.39,of different metabolic
"factors,","hormones, et cetera,"
354.03,"but it also provides simple directives,"
356.2,as to how perhaps you might want to change
358.12,your nutritional intake
or,"your exercise regimen,"
361.01,"or other lifestyle factors,"
to,bring those numbers
363.9,into alignment with where
you'd,like them to be.
366.574,InsideTracker also makes this really easy.
368.67,They have a dashboard that
makes,organizing that all
370.65,"very simple, and they can"
even,have someone come
373.47,to your house to take
the,blood and DNA test.
375.9,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker,"
377.36,"you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman,"
380.37,to get 25% off any of
InsideTracker's,plans.
383.37,"Just use the code ""Huberman"", at checkout."
385.55,Today's episode is also brought
to,us by Athletic Greens.
388.65,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
390.18,vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
392.54,I started taking Athletic
Greens,"way back in 2012,"
395.52,"and I've taken it ever since,"
396.53,so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
399.07,The reason I started
taking,Athletic Greens
400.657,and that I continue to
take,"Athletic Greens,"
402.89,is that it covers all my
vitamin,"and mineral bases,"
405.76,and it covers my probiotic needs.
408.29,There's now a wealth of data showing
410.11,that probiotics support
a,"healthy gut microbiome,"
413.04,and that a healthy gut microbiome supports
415.21,the gut brain access for healthy mood.
417.07,It also supports
"metabolism,","immune function,"
419.91,"endocrine, that means hormone function,"
421.7,and a host of other important
biological,functions.
424.91,I drink it once or twice a day.
426.73,I mix it with water and a
little,bit of lemon juice
428.63,"or some lime juice, and"
it's,absolutely delicious.
431.11,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,"
432.69,"you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,"
435.76,"and if you do that, you"
can,"claim a special offer,"
438.46,where they will give you a
year's,supply of vitamin D3.
441.72,"In addition, they'll give"
you,five free travel packs.
444.25,Vitamin D3 as we all
"know,",is very important
446.78,for a huge range of biological
functions,and health.
450.01,"Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman,"
452.8,"for your Athletic Greens,"
the,"five free travel packs,"
455.04,and the year's supply of vitamin D3.
457.42,"And now, my conversation"
with,Dr. Karl Deisseroth.
461.76,"Well, thanks for being here."
463.11,- Thanks for having me.
464.58,"- It's been a long time coming for me,"
466.96,"because you may not know this,"
469.25,but one of the reasons
I,started this podcast
471.87,was actually so I could
have,this conversation.
473.947,[Karl laughs]
474.84,"It's but one, there are other reasons,"
477.47,but one of the goals is to
be,able to hold conversations
482.4,with colleagues of mine that
are,doing incredible work
485.59,"in the realm of science,"
486.71,and then here we also have
this,really special opportunity
489.58,because you're also a clinician.
491.27,You see patients and have for a long time.
493.67,So for people that
might,not be so familiar
496.08,with the fields of
"neuroscience,","et cetera,"
498.63,what is the difference between
neurology,and psychiatry?
502.932,"- Well, I'm married to a"
neurologist,and I am a psychiatrist
506.7,and we make fun of each
other,all the time.
511.102,A lot of neuroscientists and
a,lot of brain clinicians
513.84,actually think these two
should,be in the same field
516.532,"at some point in the future,"
518.24,"they were in the past,"
they,started together.
520.89,"Psychiatry though, focuses on disorders"
524.35,where we can't see something
that's,"physically wrong,"
527.69,"where we don't have a measurable,"
529.03,where there's no blood test
that,"makes the diagnosis,"
532.51,there's no brain scan that
tells,"us this is schizophrenia,"
534.977,and this is depression
for,an individual patient.
538.57,"And so psychiatry is much more mysterious,"
542.15,and the only tools we have are words.
545.64,Neurologists are fantastic physicians.
548.82,"They see the stroke on brain scans,"
552.18,they see the seizure and
the,pre-seizure activity
555.62,"with an EEG, and they can measure"
559.36,and treat based on those measureables.
562.58,"In psychiatry, we have"
a,"harder job, I think."
564.94,"We use words, we have"
rating,"scales for symptoms,"
569.14,we can measure depression and
autism,"with rating scales,"
571.94,but those are words still.
574.36,"And ultimately, that's what"
psychiatry,is built around.
577.19,It's an odd situation because
we've,"got the most complex,"
582.73,"beautiful, mysterious,"
585.38,incredibly engineered
object,"in the universe,"
588.35,and yet all we have are
words,to find our way in.
592.22,"- So, do you find that if"
a,patient is very verbal or
596.53,"hyper-verbal, that you have an"
easier,"time diagnosing them,"
600.13,as opposed to somebody who's
more,quiet and reserved?
603.68,"Or it's, I could imagine the"
opposite,might be true as well.
606.96,"- Well, because we only have words,"
608.62,you've put your finger on a key point.
610.81,"If they don't speak that much,"
in,"principle, it's harder."
614.09,The lack of speech can be a symptom.
615.86,"We can see that in depression,"
617.16,we can see that in the negative
symptoms,"of schizophrenia,"
619.82,we can see that in autism.
621.32,"Sometimes by itself, that is"
a,"symptom, reduced speech,"
625.22,but ultimately you do need something.
626.57,You need some words to help guide you
629.36,"and in fact, there's challenges"
that,I can tell you about
633.1,where patients with depression
635.303,"were so depressed, they can't speak."
638.15,That makes it a bit of a challenge
to,distinguish depression
641.42,from some of the other reasons
they,might not be speaking.
643.67,And this is sort of the art
and,the science of psychiatry.
647.63,- Do you find that there are patients
650.97,"that have, well, let's call"
them,comorbidities or conditions
654.48,where they would land in both
psychiatry,"and neurology,"
658.07,meaning there's damage to a
particular,area of the brain
661.13,and therefore they're depressed?
662.49,And how do you tease that
out,as a psychiatrist?
666.1,"- Yeah, this happens all the time."
668.18,Parkinson's disease is a great example.
672.28,It can be debilitating in so many ways.
675.54,"People have trouble moving,"
they,"have trouble walking,"
677.98,"they have trouble swallowing,"
679.65,and they can have a
truly,severe depression.
685.17,And this is where you
might,"say, ""Oh, well,"
686.99,"they've got a life-threatening illness"","
690.45,but there are plenty of
neurological,disorders
692.39,where depression is not a
strongly,"comorbid symptom,"
697.67,"like ALS, Lou Gehrig's"
"disease,","for example,"
700.05,depression is not strongly
comorbid,"in that disease,"
704.02,"but in Parkinson's, it"
is,extremely common.
706.86,"And as you know, in Parkinson's disease,"
709.38,we have loss of the dopamine
neurons,in the midbrain.
713.4,And this is a very specific
population,of cells
718.04,"that's dying, and probably that leads"
720.45,to both the movement
disorder,and the depression.
723.67,There are many examples of that
725.19,where these two fields come together
726.83,and you really need to work as a team.
729.27,"I've had patients in my clinic,"
that,I treat the depression
733.13,"associated with their Parkinson's,"
734.61,and a neurologist treats the movement
736.58,associated with the Parkinson's
and,we work together.
739.78,- Do you think we will
ever,have a blood test
742.21,for depression or schizophrenia or autism?
744.74,And would that be a good or a bad thing?
749.57,- I think ultimately there
will,be quantitative tests.
753.1,"Already, efforts are being made"
754.91,to look at certain rhythms in
the,brain using external EEGs
758.8,"to look at brain waves effectively,"
760.94,look at the ratios of certain frequencies
763.45,"to other frequencies,"
765.08,and there's some progress
being,made on that front.
767.51,It's not as good as it could be.
769.31,It doesn't really give you the confidence
771.14,for the individual patient
that,"you would like,"
774.24,"but ultimately, what's"
going,on in the brain
776.44,"in psychiatric disease is physical,"
779.76,and it's due to the
circuits,and the connections
782.7,and the projections in the
brain,that are not working
785.46,as they would in a typical situation.
787.97,And I do think we'll have those
measureables,at some point.
792.34,"Now, is that good or bad?"
794.766,"I think that will be good,"
795.687,and one of the challenges
we,have with psychiatry
799.38,is it is an art as well as a science
801.98,to elicit these symptoms in a precise way.
806.51,"It does take some time,"
and,it would be great
809.37,if we could just do quick measurements.
811.91,Could it be abused or misused?
815.24,Certainly.
816.073,"But that's I think true,"
for,all of medicine.
818.43,"- I want to know, and I'm"
sure,"there are several,"
820.37,but what do you see as
the,biggest challenge
822.7,facing psychiatry and the
treatment,of mental illness today?
829.3,- I think we're making progress
832.33,"on what the biggest challenge is,"
833.97,which I think there's
still,such a strong stigma
836.3,for psychiatric disease
837.68,"that patients often don't come to us,"
841.42,and they feel that they
should,be able to handle this
846.7,on their own.
848.61,And that can slow treatment.
850.77,It can lead to worsening symptoms.
853.72,"We know, for example,"
854.61,patients who have
untreated,anxiety issues.
857.91,If you go for a year or more
860.43,"with a serious untreated anxiety issue,"
862.69,that can convert to depression.
864.4,You can add another problem
on,top of the anxiety.
868.77,And so it would be...
871.21,Why do people not come for treatment?
872.73,They feel like this is
something,they should be able
875.21,"to master on their own, which can be true,"
878.3,"but usually, some help is a good thing."
883.23,- That raises a question
related,to something
885.71,I heard you say many
years,"ago at a lecture,"
888.4,"which was that, this"
was,a scientific lecture
891.36,"and you said, ""We don't"
know,how other people feel.
894.81,"Most of the time, we don't"
even,"really know how we feel."""
897.648,- [chuckles] Yeah.
898.481,- [Andrew] Maybe you could
elaborate,on that a little bit
901.665,and the dearth of ways that we
have,to talk about feelings.
907.5,"I mean, there's so many words."
909.0,"I don't know how many,"
910.12,but I'm guessing they're more
than,a dozen words to describe
912.92,"the state that I call sadness,"
but,"as far as I understand,"
916.33,we don't have any way of comparing that
917.76,in a real objective sense.
920.91,"As a psychiatrist, when"
your,job is to use words
923.52,"to diagnose, words of"
the,"patient to diagnose,"
926.87,do you maneuver around that?
928.65,And what is this landscape
930.24,that we call feelings or emotions?
933.13,- This is really interesting.
936.91,Here there's a tension between
the,words that we've built up
940.24,in the clinic that mean
something,"to the physicians,"
944.01,and then there's the
colloquial,use of words
946.2,"that may not be the same,"
947.28,and so that's the first
level,we have to sort out
949.6,"when someone says, ""I'm depressed"","
953.66,what exactly do they mean by that?
956.34,And that may be different
from,what we're talking about
958.52,in terms of depression.
959.5,So part of psychiatry is
to,"get beyond that word,"
962.92,and to get into how
they're,"actually feeling,"
965.425,get rid of the jargon and
get,to real world examples
969.85,of how they're feeling.
972.9,"So, how much do you look"
forward,into the future?
976.68,How much hope do you have?
979.01,How much planning are
you,doing for the future?
981.06,So here now you're
getting,into actual things
984.27,you can talk about that are unambiguous.
986.27,"If someone says, ""Yeah, I can't"
even,think about tomorrow.
990.19,I don't see how I'm going
to,"get to tomorrow""."
994.778,"That's a nice, precise"
thing,"that you know,"
996.95,"it's sad, it's tragic, but"
"also,",that means something.
1000.947,And we know what that means.
1002.24,That's the hopelessness
symptom,of depression.
1005.06,And that is what I try to do
1006.9,when I do a psychiatric interview.
1008.14,"I try to get past the jargon,"
1009.81,and get to what's actually
happening,in a patient's life
1012.01,and in their mind.
1013.41,"But as you say, ultimately,"
1015.287,[chuckles] and this shows up across...
1017.81,"I address this issue every day in my life,"
1020.97,whether it's in the lab where
we're,"looking at animals,"
1024.98,whether fish or mice or rats
and,"studying their behavior,"
1028.7,or when I'm in a conversation
with,just a friend
1032.23,"or a colleague, or when"
I'm,"talking to a patient,"
1035.81,I never really know what's going on
1037.64,inside the mind of the other person.
1040.72,"I get some feedback, I get words,"
1043.95,"I get behaviors, I get actions,"
but,I never really know.
1047.25,And as you said at the very
beginning,"of the question,"
1049.72,often we don't even have
the,words and the insight
1052.5,to even understand what's
going,on in our own mind.
1054.99,I think a lot of psychiatrists
are,pretty introspective.
1057.9,That's part of the reason
they,"end up in that specialty,"
1060.08,"and so, maybe we spend a little more time"
1064.21,than the average person
1065.05,"thinking about what's going on within,"
1066.66,but it doesn't mean we have the answers.
1069.48,- So in this area of trying to figure out
1073.64,what's going on under
the,"hood through words,"
1075.97,it sounds like certain words would relate
1078.93,to this idea of anticipation and hope.
1083.07,Is it fair to say that
that,somehow relates
1085.17,to the dopamine system in the sense
1086.93,that dopamine is involved
in,motivated behaviors?
1090.49,"I mean, if I say for instance,"
1093.19,and I won't ask you to
run,a session with me here
1095.97,[chuckles] for free.
[Karl,laughs]
1097.95,- We'll do that off camera.
1099.11,- [Andrew] Off camera. Right.
1100.76,"If I were to say, ""I just"
can't,imagine tomorrow.
1107.147,"I just can't do it."""
1108.92,"So that's not an action-based,"
1111.14,that's purely based on
my,"internal narrative,"
1114.73,"but I could imagine things like, you know,"
1117.28,I have a terrible time
"sleeping,","I'm not hungry,"
1120.63,"I'm not eating, so statements"
about,"physical actions,"
1123.51,I'm guessing also have validity.
1126.459,- Absolutely.
1127.292,- And there are now ways to measure
1130.29,the accuracy of those statements.
1131.83,"Like for instance, if"
I,"gave you permission,"
1133.73,"you could know if I slept last night,"
1135.89,or whether or not I was just saying
1137.11,I had a poor night's sleep.
1138.35,- Yes. That's right.
1139.47,- So in moving forward through 2021
1142.75,and into the next 10 and
100,"years of psychiatry,"
1145.73,do you think that the body
reporting,some of the actions
1151.05,of a human are going to become useful
1154.29,and mesh with the words in a way
1156.93,that's going to make your job easier?
1159.02,- I do think that's true.
1159.97,And the two things you've
"mentioned,","eating and sleeping,"
1162.59,those are additional criteria
1165.34,that we use to diagnose depression.
1166.91,"These are the vegetative signs,"
we,"call them of depression,"
1169.28,"poor sleep, and poor eating."
1170.54,"And if you have a baseline for somebody,"
1172.48,that's the real challenge there.
1174.06,What's different in that person?
1175.73,Some people with
"depressed,",they sleep more.
1177.76,Some people who are
"depressed,",they sleep less.
1180.56,"Some people who are depressed,"
1181.65,"they're more physically agitated,"
and,they move around more.
1184.97,"Some people who are depressed,"
1186.06,they move less even while they're awake.
1188.19,And so you need...
1189.27,Here's the challenge is
that,you can't just look
1191.86,at how they are now.
1193.23,"You have to get a baseline,"
and,then see how it's changed.
1197.32,And that can be a challenge
that,"raises ethical issues,"
1202.535,and how do you collect
that,baseline information
1204.74,from someone healthy?
1205.77,I don't think that's
something,we have solved.
1208.61,"Of course, with phones and"
accelerometers,"and phones,"
1211.92,"you could in principle,"
1212.98,collect a lot of baseline
information,"from people,"
1215.97,but that would have to be treated
1218.13,very carefully for privacy reasons.
1221.55,- And in terms of measuring
one's,"own behavior,"
1224.623,I've heard of work that's going on.
1225.456,Sam Golden up in the
University,of Washington
1230.46,who works on aggression in animal models
1232.12,was telling me that there's
some,"efforts that he's making,"
1234.64,and perhaps you're involved
in,"this work as well,"
1236.59,"I don't know, of devices"
that,would allow people
1241.2,"to detect, for instance,"
1242.63,when they're veering
towards,a depressive episode
1244.79,"for themselves, that they"
may,choose or not choose
1247.26,"to report that to their clinician,"
1248.85,maybe they don't even have a clinician.
1250.23,Maybe this person that you
referred,"to at the beginning,"
1253.41,this person who doesn't feel comfortable
1254.83,"coming to talk to you,"
1257.77,maybe something is measuring
changes,in the inflection
1260.12,"of their voice, or the speed"
1262.13,at which they get up from a chair.
1263.59,Do you think that those kind of metrics
1264.97,will eventually inform
"somebody,","""Hey, you know,"
1266.84,"you're in trouble""?"
1268.03,This is getting to back to the statement
1270.98,that I heard you make and
it,"rung in my mind now,"
1273.07,"I think for more than a decade,"
1274.41,"which is, ""Oftentimes, we"
don't,"even know how we feel."""
1277.02,- Yeah.
1277.853,"You know, that I do like,"
1279.08,because that gives the
patient,the agency to detect
1282.12,"what's going on, and even"
separate,"from modern technology,"
1285.19,this has been part of
the,art of psychiatry
1287.41,is to help patients realize
1289.08,that sometimes other people observing them
1292.06,can give them the earliest
warning,signs of depression.
1295.0,We see this very often in family.
1297.93,They'll notice when
the,patient is changing
1300.53,before the patient does.
1302.07,And then there are things
the,"patient may notice,"
1303.91,but not correctly ascribe
to,the onset of depression.
1307.52,And a classic example of that
1308.84,is what we call 'early morning awakening'.
1311.25,And this is something
that,can happen very early
1313.52,as people start to slide into depression.
1315.27,"They start to wake up earlier and earlier,"
1317.8,"just inexplicably, they're awake at-"
1319.86,"- This is like 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM awakening?"
1322.15,- It could start...
1322.983,"Yeah, it could start at"
5:00,"AM, could go to four,"
1325.645,and three-
-,And are unable
1326.478,to fall back asleep?
1327.311,- Unable to fall back asleep. Exactly.
1330.04,And they may not know
what,to do with that.
1332.42,"It could just be, [chuckles]"
from,"their perspective,"
1334.13,it's just something that's happening.
1335.87,But if you put enough of
that,"information together,"
1338.11,that could be a useful
warning,sign for the patient
1340.417,and it could help them seek treatment.
1342.046,And I think that is something
that,could be really valuable.
1344.91,- Interesting.
1345.95,"So, in this framework of"
needing,words to self-report
1351.94,or machines to detect how we feel
1354.377,and maybe inform a psychiatrist
how,"a patient feels,"
1359.92,touch on some of the technologies
1362.17,"that you've been involved in building,"
1364.12,"but as a way to march into that,"
1368.08,are there any very good treatments
for,psychiatric disease?
1372.23,"Meaning, are there currently"
any,"pills, potions,"
1375.65,forms of communication that
reliably,"work every time,"
1380.11,or work in most patients?
1381.57,And could you give a couple
examples,of great successes
1383.92,of psychiatry if they exist?
1385.42,- Yes.
1386.29,"Yeah, we are fortunate."
1387.43,And this [chuckles] coming
back,"to my, you know,"
1389.4,the joking between my wife and myself
1392.85,"in terms of neurology and psychiatry,"
1395.33,"we actually in psychiatry,"
despite,the depths
1398.67,"of the mystery we struggled with,"
1401.1,many of our treatments are actually...
1404.11,We may be doing better
than,some other specialties
1406.18,in terms of actually
causing,therapeutic benefit
1409.0,for patients.
1410.03,"We do help patients, the"
patients,who suffer from...
1414.77,"By the way, both"
medications,and talk therapy
1416.71,have been shown to be extremely
effective,"in many cases,"
1419.43,"for example, people with panic disorder,"
1422.67,"cognitive behavioral therapy,"
just,"working with words,"
1425.21,helping people identify the early signs
1427.32,of when they're starting to
move,"toward a panic attack,"
1429.61,what are the cognitions
that,are happening?
1432.11,"You can train people to derail that,"
1434.2,and you can very potently
treat,panic disorder that way.
1437.54,- How long does something
like,that take on average?
1440.43,"- For a motivated, insightful patient,"
1442.42,you can have a very
cookbooky,"series of sessions,"
1446.983,"that's six to 12 sessions, or even less"
1449.67,for someone who's very
insightful,and motivated
1452.06,and it can have a very
powerful,effect that quickly.
1455.53,"And that's just with words,"
1457.53,there are many psychiatric medications
1459.59,that are very effective for the conditions
1462.43,that they're treating.
1463.97,"Anti-psychotic medications,"
they,"have side effects,"
1466.68,"but boy, do they work!"
1467.97,They really can clear up
particularly,the positive symptoms
1471.3,"of schizophrenia for example,"
the,"auditory hallucinations,"
1475.34,"the paranoia, people's lives"
can,be turned around by these-
1479.17,- We should clarify positive symptoms.
1480.82,You mean not positive in
the,"qualitative sense,"
1483.81,you mean positive meaning
that,the appearance
1485.43,of something abnormal.
1486.65,- Exactly. Yeah.
1487.51,Thank you for that clarification.
1488.8,"When we say positive symptoms,"
1490.47,we do mean the addition of something
1492.21,"that wasn't there before,"
1493.13,"like a hallucination or a paranoia,"
1495.08,and that stands in contrast
to,the negative symptoms
1497.76,"where something is taken away,"
1499.45,and these are patients who are withdrawn.
1502.65,They have what we call thought blocking.
1505.25,They can't even progress forward
in,a sequence of thoughts.
1509.35,Both of those can be
part,"of schizophrenia,"
1512.17,the hallucinations and the paranoia
1514.42,"are more effectively treated right now,"
1515.96,but they are effectively treated.
1518.22,"And then, this is a frustrating,"
1521.42,and yet heartening aspect of psychiatry.
1523.95,There are treatments like
electroconvulsive,"therapy,"
1527.256,where it's extremely
effective,for depression.
1531.15,We have patients who
nothing,"else works for them,"
1535.49,"where they can't tolerate medications,"
1537.39,"and you can administer under a very safe,"
1540.81,"controlled condition,"
1542.53,where the patient's body is not moving.
1544.62,They're put into a very safe situation
1546.59,"where the body doesn't move or cease,"
1548.65,it's just an internal process
that's,triggered in the brain.
1552.82,This is an extraordinarily
effective,treatment
1554.86,for treatment-resistant depression.
1556.94,"At the same time, I find it [chuckles]"
1558.61,as heartening as it is to
see,patients respond to this
1562.235,"who have severe depression,"
I'm,also frustrated by it.
1566.21,Why can't we do something
more,"precise than this,"
1569.73,for these very severe cases?
1571.65,And people have sought
for,"decades to understand,"
1575.0,how is it that a seizure is leading
1577.41,to the relief of depression?
1579.08,And we don't know the answer yet.
1580.46,We would love to do that.
1581.57,"People are working hard on that,"
1583.45,but that is a treatment
that,does work too.
1586.366,In all of these cases
though,"in psychiatry,"
1588.27,the frustrating thing
is,that we don't have
1591.77,the level of understanding
that,a cardiologist has
1594.84,in thinking about the heart.
1595.95,"You know, the heart is,"
we,now know it's a pump.
1598.24,It's pumping blood. and so
you,can look at everything
1600.98,"about how it's working or not working,"
1603.43,"in terms of that frame,"
it's,clearly a pump.
1607.17,We don't really have that level
1609.24,"of, what is the circuit really"
there,for in psychiatry?
1615.256,And that's what is missing.
1616.93,"That's what we need to find,"
1618.64,so we can design truly effective
and,specific treatments.
1622.2,"- So, what are the pieces"
that,are going to be required
1625.97,"to cure autism, cure"
"Parkinson's,",cure schizophrenia?
1631.96,I would imagine there are several
elements,"and 'beens here',"
1636.27,"understanding the natural biology,"
1638.86,understanding what the
activity,"patterns are,"
1641.45,"how to modify those, maybe"
you,could just tell us
1644.43,"what you think, what is the"
Bento,Box of the perfect cure?
1650.07,- I think the first thing
we,need is understanding.
1654.14,Almost every psychiatric treatment
1655.56,"has been serendipitously identified,"
1657.67,just noting by chance that
something,that was done
1661.51,for some person also had a side effect-
1664.2,- Like lithium or something-
1665.09,"- Like lithium, is a good example."
1666.8,- Is it true that it was
the,urine of guinea pigs
1669.268,[Karl laughs]
given,lithium
1670.18,that was given to manic patients
that,made them not manic?
1672.88,Is that true?
1673.75,- I don't have firsthand
knowledge,"of that,"
1675.22,"but I would defer that,"
1677.28,but it's true for
essentially,"every treatment,"
1679.7,that the antidepressants originally arose
1683.09,"as anti-tuberculosis drugs, for example."
1685.561,- I did not know that.
1686.394,"- Yeah, and so this is a"
classic,example for illnesses
1690.52,"across all of psychiatry,"
1692.8,and of course there's
the,seizures as well.
1694.39,That was noticed that
patients,"who had epilepsy,"
1696.43,they had a seizure there
and,"also had depression,"
1699.38,"that they became much,"
at,"least for awhile,"
1701.44,they were improved after that seizure.
1703.63,- That's amazing.
1704.463,I don't want to take you
off,course of the question
1706.491,"answering the question I asked,"
1707.324,but I've heard before that if
autistic,"children get a fever,"
1711.32,"that their symptoms improve, is that true?"
1713.85,- I've done a fair bit
of,work with autism.
1717.87,"In my clinical practice,"
I,work with adult autism
1720.23,and I have heard statements like that
1722.46,and descriptions like that from
patients,and their families.
1728.04,That is very hard to study quantitatively
1730.3,because often with the
"children,",you have this
1734.01,not as quantitative as you'd like
1735.84,collection of symptom
information,from home.
1739.75,But I have heard that enough that I think
1742.0,there may well be something to that.
1747.104,And anytime you have a
"fever,",what's going on?
1748.96,"Well, we know all the cells in the brain,"
1751.527,"and I know this as an electrophysiologist,"
1753.58,if you just change the
temperature,"by a few degrees,"
1755.62,everything changes about how neurons work
1757.57,and that's even just a single neuron.
1759.51,It's even more likely to
be,complex and different
1762.42,with a circuit of neurons that
are,all affecting each other.
1765.12,"Just elevate the temperature a little bit,"
1766.77,everything's different.
1767.68,"And so, it's plausible for sure,"
1770.5,that things like that
could,happen and do happen.
1774.62,"And yet, when you think about"
"autism,","to take your example,"
1779.17,"yes, we see changes,"
1780.8,but what is the elements of
the,brain that's analogous
1785.26,to the pumping heart?
1786.63,When we think about the
symptoms,"of depression,"
1791.12,we think about motivation
and,dopamine neurons.
1793.99,"When we think about autism,"
it's,a little more challenging.
1798.24,There's a deficit in social interaction
1803.5,and in communication.
1806.22,And so where is that?
1807.397,[chuckles] Where is that situated?
1809.87,What is the key principle
governing,the social interaction?
1815.63,This is where we need the basic science
1817.78,"to bring us a step forward,"
1819.4,"so we can say okay, this is"
the,process that's going on.
1821.83,This is what's needed for
the,incredibly complex task
1825.18,"of social interaction,"
1827.01,where you've got incredibly
rich,data streams of sound
1830.56,"and meaning, eye contact, body movement,"
1833.13,and that's just for one person.
1834.26,What if there's a group of people?
1836.13,This is overwhelming
for,people with autism.
1839.587,What's the unifying thing there?
1841.94,"It's a lot of information,"
1843.534,and that maybe is unmatched
in,"any realm of biology,"
1848.52,the amount of information coming in
1849.9,"through a social interaction,"
1850.98,particularly with words and language.
1853.83,"And so then, that turns our"
attention,"as neuroscientists,"
1857.03,"we think, okay, let's think"
about,the parts of the brain
1860.11,that are involved in dealing with merging
1864.8,complex data streams that
are,very high in bit rate
1868.33,that need to be fused together
into,a unitary concept.
1872.74,"And that starts to guide us,"
1875.346,and we know other animals
are,"social in their own way,"
1877.537,and we can study those animals.
1879.08,And so that's how I think about it.
1881.15,"There's hope for the future,"
1882.41,thinking about the symptoms
as,"an engineer might,"
1885.67,and trying to identify the
circuits,that are likely working
1890.19,"to make this typical behavior happen,"
1892.41,and that will help us understand
how,it becomes atypical.
1895.15,"- So that seems like the first to me,"
1897.53,"the first been of this,"
what,I call the Bento Box
1901.01,"for lack of a better analogy,"
1903.02,that we need to know the circuits.
1904.69,We need to know the cells
in,the various brain regions
1907.87,and end portions of the body
1909.608,"and how they connect to one another,"
1912.28,and what the patterns of activity are
1914.5,under a normal 'healthy interaction'.
1917.82,- [Karl] Yeah.
1919.1,"- If we understand that, then"
it,"seems that the next step,"
1924.27,which of course could be
carried,"out in parallel, right?"
1926.48,Though that work can
be,done alongside work
1929.13,where various elements within
those,circuits are tweaked
1933.11,"just right, like the tuning"
of,"a piano in the subtle way,"
1936.19,or maybe even like the
replacement,of a whole set of keys
1938.31,"if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak."
1940.656,- Right.
1941.49,- You've been very involved
1942.66,in trying to generate those tools.
1946.41,"Tell us about channelopsins,"
1949.67,"why you created them,"
and,where they're at now
1954.44,in the laboratory and
perhaps,also in the clinic.
1958.57,"- Well, first of all, I"
give,nature the credit
1962.146,for creating channelrhodopsins.
1963.97,These are beautiful little
proteins,"that are made by algae,"
1968.15,single-celled green algae.
1970.31,And there's a great story in basic science
1973.19,"that our understanding of animal behavior,"
1977.51,"sensation, cognition"
and,action in our brains
1980.71,all the way back to a botanist
in,the 1850s and 1860s
1986.12,"in Russia, is where the story begins."
1988.55,So this was a botanist
named,Andrei Famintsyn
1992.34,"who worked at St. Petersburg,"
1994.9,and he had noticed in the
river,"near his laboratory,"
1999.97,that there were algae
that,he could look at
2003.7,"in a dish, in a saucer."
2005.17,He could put them there and he had light
2007.27,shining from the side.
2009.36,The green tinge in the saucer of water
2014.64,would move to a particular
distance,from the light
2018.82,"that he was shining from the side,"
2020.42,which was an amazing thing.
2022.47,"If he made the light brighter,"
2024.88,the green tinge would
back,off a little bit
2027.1,"to a more optimal location,"
so,just the right light level.
2030.43,So this was plant behavior.
2033.02,"It was light-driven plant behavior,"
2034.69,and he delves into this a little bit.
2036.21,"He identified that with microscopy,"
2038.73,he could see that there were
little,single-cell algae
2041.06,with flagella that were swimming
to,the right light level.
2045.38,"So behaving plants, and"
this,has been the secret
2047.92,that's helped us unlock so many principles
2050.9,of animal behavior.
2052.84,"So turns out,"
2055.54,these algae achieve this amazing results
2060.42,with a single gene that
encodes,a single protein.
2065.95,What's a protein?
2066.783,It's just a little bio-molecule
that,does a job in a cell.
2070.35,And these are proteins that
sit,in the surface of cells
2074.28,"in their surface membrane,"
2076.28,"and when a photon, a"
light,"particle hits them,"
2079.49,"they open a little pore, a"
little,hole in the membrane
2082.28,"and charged particles, ions like sodium"
2085.54,rush across the pore.
2088.26,"Now, why do they do that?"
2089.67,They do that to guide their
"flagella,","that signal coming in,"
2093.36,those ions coming in through the pore
2095.23,"in response to light,"
guide,"their flagella motor,"
2098.5,that guides them to a
particular,spot in the saucer.
2103.71,"Now, that's plant"
"behavior,","but it turns out,"
2106.83,"as you know, this movement"
of,"ions across the membrane,"
2109.91,this happens to also be a neural code
2112.5,in our brains for on or off.
2115.12,Sodium ions rushing into
the,"cells, turns them on."
2118.19,"It makes them fire away, fire"
action,potentials communicate
2121.47,"to the next cell down the chain,"
2124.5,and this is an amazing opportunity
2127.02,because we can borrow these proteins.
2131.32,"In fact, we can take the gene"
2132.85,"that directs the creation of the protein,"
2135.36,and we can use genetic
"tricks,",modern genetic tricks
2137.58,to put that gene into neurons
in,"the brains of mammals,"
2144.002,"and then use light to turn those cells,"
2146.57,the specific cells that
we,"put this gene into,"
2149.29,turn them on.
2150.25,"There are other opsins, we call them,"
2152.98,that you can use to turn cells off.
2155.3,"It's all fast, real time."
2157.92,You can play in patterns
of,activity in real time
2160.7,into cells or kinds of
"cells,",just as a conductor
2164.0,"elicits the music from the orchestra,"
2165.77,the strings and the woodwinds.
2167.7,And you can see what matters.
2169.8,"What matters for sensation,"
what,"matters for cognition,"
2172.27,"what matters for action, and"
we,call this optogenetics.
2175.36,"- Beautiful, and I must"
say,it was quite an honor
2178.57,and a privilege to watch optogenetics move
2182.02,from idea to discovery to the laboratory.
2186.82,"I think we were postdocs at the same time,"
2188.783,"- We were, huh?"
2189.616,- which is living proof that
people,"move at different rates,"
2192.34,because [laughs] it's a joke
at,"my expense by the way,"
2196.015,[Karl laughing]
2197.75,but it's really-
2198.81,- We end up in the same spot. [laughs]
2199.643,"- That's right, [laughs]"
"yeah,",more or less.
2201.77,"Physically, if not professionally,"
2204.21,"but nonetheless, it's been"
a,marvelous story thus far.
2208.46,And I'd like to...
2209.96,Maybe you could give us...
2210.793,I'd like to just touch
on,a couple examples
2213.27,of where the technology
resides,"in laboratories now,"
2216.85,so maybe the range of animals
that,"it's being used in,"
2219.23,and some of the phenomenon
2220.71,that channelrhodopsins
and,their related genes
2225.63,and proteins are starting
to,"elicit, what you've seen,"
2230.85,and then I'd like to talk
about,their applicability
2233.46,"to the clinic, which is I"
think,"the bigger mission,"
2236.95,if you will.
2238.04,- Yeah.
2238.873,"So this whole thing, you know,"
2242.7,"it's been about, now going on 17 years"
2245.83,that we've been putting
channelrhodopsins,into neurons.
2248.46,It started just like Andre
Famintsyn's,"work in a dish,"
2253.733,that was in 2004.
2254.776,"In 2007, we were putting"
these,"into behaving mice,"
2258.22,and we were able to with
a,"flick of a switch,"
2262.0,cause them to move one
direction,"or another,"
2264.71,by 2009-
2265.9,"- So basically, you're"
controlling,the mouse's behavior?
2268.36,"- Yeah, exactly. In real time."
2269.65,So we could make a mouse
that,was just sitting there
2271.31,"doing nothing, to then turn"
left,"very consistently,"
2274.67,"in fact, go around in a circle"
2275.99,and as soon as we turn off
the,"light, it would stop."
2278.1,That was an eye-opening moment.
2281.6,It took really a few years
to,make optogenetics work.
2285.03,There was a lot of putting all the...
2288.13,There are a lot of problems
that,had to be solved.
2289.68,These channelrhodopsins
actually,don't move many ions.
2294.19,"They have a small current,"
small,"conductance, as we say."
2297.1,And so we had to figure out
ways,to pack a lot of them
2300.14,"into cells without damaging cells,"
2303.47,"and still make them targetable,"
2305.21,so we don't want them to
just,"be in all the cells,"
2307.15,'cause then it becomes
just,like an electrode.
2309.53,You're just stimulating all
the,cells that are nearby.
2311.26,"We had to keep that specificity,"
2313.65,make them targetable to just
one,"kind of cell or another,"
2317.54,while still packing in
large,numbers of them
2319.47,into those cells.
2320.97,And we had to get in the light
in,"safe and specific ways,"
2323.49,and so it took probably
about,four or five years
2326.42,to really create optogenetics
between,2004 and 2009.
2330.62,"By the end of that time though,"
2331.84,we had all the basic light
"delivery,","gene delivery,"
2337.1,"principles worked out, and"
people,started to apply
2340.51,"the technology to fish, to rats, to mice,"
2345.57,"to non-human primates like monkeys,"
2349.89,"and just a couple months ago,"
2354.27,"my colleague, Botond Rosca in Switzerland,"
2357.07,succeeded in putting channelrhodopsins
2359.89,into the eyes of human beings
2361.69,and making a blind person to see.
2363.87,And so that's pretty cool.
2366.92,This was a patient with
retinal,"degeneration,"
2370.69,and he provided a channelrhodopsin
2372.96,into the eye of this patient
2374.667,and was able to confer
some,light sensitivity
2376.91,onto this patient that
wasn't,there before.
2378.82,- An amazing paper and discovery.
2380.68,"I realize it was one patient,"
2382.12,but it's such an important milestone.
2384.11,"- Well, as you say, it's"
a,very important milestone
2386.87,and the history of that is very deep.
2390.85,"Almost 10 years earlier,"
Botond,Rosca and I
2393.52,had published a paper in
science,"in human retina,"
2397.08,but X plants taken from cadavers
from,"someone who had died,"
2400.64,"the living retina taken out,"
2403.75,opsins put into this retinal tissue
2407.13,"and showing that it worked,"
recording,from the cells
2409.64,showing that in these
human,"retinal neurons,"
2412.21,that you could get light responses.
2414.66,"But then, from that moment,"
2416.77,almost 10 years of how
clinical,"development goes,"
2420.09,and this is a gene therapy
2421.5,and so you've got all the regulations
2424.06,and concerns and all that.
2425.27,It took almost 10 years
to,get to this point now
2427.83,where a living human being
has,a new functionality
2430.89,that wasn't there before.
2432.86,"Now, that's incredibly inspiring,"
2437.092,and it's a beautiful thing.
2438.33,"I would say though,"
2439.163,that the broader
significance,of optogenetics
2443.75,"is really still understanding,"
because,once you understand
2447.35,how the circuitry works and
which,"cells actually matter,"
2450.52,then any kind of treatment
becomes,more grounded and logical
2454.77,and specific and principled.
2457.21,And whether it's a
"medication,",or a talk therapy
2459.39,or brain stimulation treatment
2460.82,"with electrical or magnetic means,"
2463.51,"if you actually know what matters,"
2465.64,[chuckles] that is incredibly powerful.
2466.81,"And I think,"
2470.75,not intended to disparage
the,beautiful retinal work
2474.61,and conferring vision on
someone,"who couldn't see,"
2477.76,"of course that's wonderful,"
2481.13,and that's direct what you might call
2482.57,direct optogenetics in patients.
2484.18,Indirect is everything that
comes,from understanding.
2487.44,"Okay, we know these cells"
matter,"now, for this symptom."
2490.39,"Well, how can we target those cells"
2493.07,and help them work better
in,patients by any means?
2495.61,And I think that's the
broader,significance
2497.67,"of optogenetics, clinically."
2499.314,"- I know Botond well,"
2500.76,and you and Botond share
this,"incredible big vision,"
2506.8,that I think only a clinician
can,"really understand,"
2510.38,being in close contact within
the,suffering of patients
2514.61,as a ultimate motivator of
developing,"technologies,"
2517.68,"which makes me have to ask,"
2520.38,did you decide to become a scientist
2522.94,to find cures for mental disease?
2526.561,"- [chuckles] No, I didn't."
2530.05,It's a really important
question,to actually look back
2532.116,and see the steps that brought
you,to a particular place.
2536.51,And that was not what brought
me,initially to science
2540.67,"and it's okay I think,"
to,embrace [chuckles]
2543.47,the twists and turns
that,"life brings to you,"
2547.4,but I was always interested in the brain.
2549.09,"And so, that was something"
that,for me started
2552.65,from a very early age.
2555.3,We talked about being introspective.
2556.871,I noticed very early on I
had,a deep love of poetry
2561.53,"and stories, and I was a voracious reader,"
2566.62,and I was amazed by how
words,could make me feel
2572.9,in particular ways.
2574.555,"Even separate from their, of"
"course,","dictionary meanings,"
2578.42,"the rhythm, and how they work together,"
2581.19,even separate from meaning.
2583.26,And I was stunned by poets that
could,use words in new ways
2587.45,that were even divorced
from,"their meaning at all,"
2590.48,and yet could still
trigger,specific emotions.
2592.5,And this was always fascinating to me.
2595.82,"So, I wanted to understand that,"
2599.83,and so I was interested and I
became,interested in the brain
2603.32,"and I thought, well, I'm"
going,to to have to study
2605.21,"the human brain, because only"
human,beings can describe
2611.22,what's going on inside enough.
2614.11,"So in college, I began to"
steer,"myself toward medicine,"
2619.12,with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon.
2621.93,"And so I came here to medical school,"
2627.12,"and did an MD PhD program,"
2630.26,planning neurosurgery all the way through.
2632.11,The first rotation I did at
the,"end of medical school,"
2635.84,"as you know, you do rotations,"
2637.54,"you go through different specialties,"
2639.09,"and some of these are required rotations,"
2641.11,everybody has to do this summary elective
2642.87,where you can pick what you want to do.
2646.23,I elected to do the
neurosurgery,"first, [chuckles]"
2648.44,even before regular surgery.
2649.81,I was that sure I wanted
to,"do it, and I loved it."
2651.71,I had a fantastic time.
2653.41,There was an amazing patient
who,"had a thalamic damage,"
2657.63,and there was a neglect syndrome
2659.07,where the patient was not
able,to be aware of something
2662.63,that was right in front of him-
2664.86,- Even though their
vision,was perfectly fine?
2666.05,- Even though their vision
was,"perfectly fine, exactly."
2670.21,"And I loved the operating room,"
2671.48,I loved the rhythm of suturing
and,"the precision of it,"
2676.307,and I loved being able to
help,"patients immediately,"
2680.1,but then a required
rotation,"was in psychiatry,"
2685.37,which I was not looking forward to at all.
2688.47,"And that completely reset my whole life,"
2691.59,that experience in psychiatry.
2694.19,And it was at that moment that I saw
2696.61,"this is first of all, the greatest need,"
2700.17,the depth of suffering
2701.92,and the depth of the mystery together.
2705.85,"And also it was, I almost feel"
a,little guilty about this.
2709.24,It's so interesting too.
2711.193,"Yes, we can help."
2713.89,"Yes, there's need, but as a scientist,"
2717.26,"this is amazing, that someone's"
reality,can be different
2720.85,"from my own, with everything physically,"
2724.35,as far as we can tell the same
with,"the measures we have,"
2729.1,and yet we've got a different reality.
2730.52,"That is an amazing thing,"
and,if we can understand that
2734.06,"and help these people,"
that,would be just more
2738.36,than anybody could ask for.
2739.193,And so that's how I ended
up,"taking this path,"
2742.5,just a required rotation in psychiatry.
2746.3,- It all started with poetry?
2747.97,- And it started with poetry.
2749.39,"- Out of respect for poetry,"
2752.35,are there any favorites
that,you spend time with
2755.92,on a regular basis?
2757.54,"- I mean, the ones who"
got,me down this path
2761.95,"early on, I remember in"
childhood,"and high school,"
2765.99,Borges had an immense influence on me.
2769.28,I studied Spanish all the way
through,and reading his work.
2774.1,He was a great writer.
2775.6,He wrote both in English and in Spanish
2777.6,and being able to appreciate his poetry
2780.1,both in English and in Spanish
was,a pretty amazing thing.
2783.17,Not many poets can do that.
2785.72,- You're bilingual?
2786.86,"- I'm not, I wouldn't say."
2788.33,"Now I became, at one point"
I,was effectively fluent
2791.5,"in Spanish, and I'm pretty"
good,with medical Spanish still
2794.55,because we use Spanish all
the,time in the clinic here.
2799.54,"I wouldn't claim full fluency,"
but,it's something I can
2802.51,definitely use all the time.
2804.424,And that's been very
helpful,in the clinic.
2805.95,"- Yeah, Borges is wonderful."
2807.03,"As the son of an Argentine,"
I,grew up hearing about it
2809.87,and I learned that Borges'
favorite,city was Geneva.
2813.6,So I spent time in Geneva
only,for that reason.
2816.38,It's also turns out
2817.294,[Karl laughs]
to,be an interesting city.
2818.42,- Yes.
2820.24,- So you developed
methods,to control neurons
2824.77,with these algae proteins using light?
2829.22,- Yeah.
2830.3,"- In 2015, there was what I"
thought,was a very nice article
2834.38,published in the New
"Yorker,",describing your work
2837.23,and the current state of your work
2839.95,"in the laboratory and the clinic,"
2841.64,and an interaction with a patient.
2844.47,"So this as I recall, a woman"
who,"was severely depressed,"
2848.35,and you reported in that article
2850.39,"some of the discussion with this patient,"
2852.5,"and then in real time,"
2854.86,increased the activation of
the,"so-called vagus nerve,"
2858.28,this 10th cranial nerve that
extends,out of the skull
2860.41,and innervates many of
the,viscera and body.
2865.57,What is the potential
for,channelrhodopsins
2868.88,or related types of algae engineering
2872.33,to be used to manipulate the vagus?
2876.2,"Because I believe in that instance,"
2877.39,"it wasn't channelopsin stimulation,"
2879.02,"it was electrical stimulation, right?"
2880.76,"Or to manipulate for instance,"
2882.28,a very small localized
region,of the brain?
2884.88,Let me frame it a little bit differently
2887.46,in light of what we were talking
about,a couple minutes ago.
2890.85,My understanding is that if
somebody,has severe depression
2894.03,and they take any number
2895.79,of the available pharmaceutical
agents,"that are out there,"
2899.68,"SSRI, serotonergic agents,"
increased,"dopamine,"
2902.92,"increased whatever, that"
sometimes,"they experience relief,"
2906.4,but they're often serious side effects.
2908.25,"Sometimes they don't experience relief,"
2909.97,"but as I understand it,"
2912.12,channelopsins and their related
"technology,","in principle,"
2915.69,would allow you to turn on
or,off the specific regions
2920.67,of the brain that lead to
the,"depressive symptoms,"
2923.42,"or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit,"
2925.53,or a positive anticipation circuit.
2929.82,Where are we at now in terms
of,bringing this technology
2933.43,to the nervous system?
2935.01,"And let's start with the body,"
and,then move into the skull.
2938.96,- Yup.
2939.793,So starting with the
body,is a good example
2941.47,because it highlights the opportunity
2944.71,and how far we have to go.
2946.74,So let's take this example
of,vagus nerve stimulation.
2949.77,"So the vagus nerve, it's"
the,10th cranial nerve.
2952.14,"It comes from the brain, it goes down"
2954.13,and innervates the heart
and,innervates the gut.
2956.48,"And by innervate, I mean it"
sends,little connections down
2958.91,to help guide what happens in these organs
2962.182,in the abdomen and chest.
2965.87,"It also collects information back,"
2967.86,and there's information coming
back,from all those organs
2970.76,"that also go through this vagus nerve,"
2972.72,"the 10th cranial nerve, back to the brain."
2975.23,And so this is somewhat of a
super,"highway to the brain,"
2979.197,and it was the idea.
2980.32,And maybe the idea is maybe
we,"could put a little cuff,"
2983.21,a little electrical device
around,"the vagus nerve itself,"
2988.66,and maybe have just like
a,"pacemaker battery,"
2990.71,have a little power source
here,"under the clavicle,"
2993.41,"everything under the skin,"
and,have a little cuff
2996.531,"and drive signals, and maybe"
they'll,get back to the brain.
2999.41,So a way of getting into the brain
3000.96,without putting something
physical,into the brain.
3003.76,- And why the vagus?
3004.81,"I mean, it's there and it's accessible-"
3006.91,- That's the reason.
3007.765,- [chuckles] That's the reason?
3008.598,"- [chuckles] That's the reason, yes."
3009.431,- Really?
3010.264,- Yeah.
3011.097,- You're not kidding?
3011.93,- [Karl] I'm not kidding.
3012.763,- So stimulating the
vagus,"to treat depression,"
3013.72,simply because it's accessible.
3015.46,- It started actually
as,an epilepsy treatment
3019.487,"and it can help with epilepsy,"
but,"yes, it's simple."
3022.378,"- God, you got to love medicine."
3023.7,"As a scientist, this is"
where,I get to chuckle
3026.27,"and you say, I'm in the field of medicine"
3028.45,from that perspective.
3030.26,From the perspective of
a,"scientist and outsider,"
3033.2,the field of medicine
is,a field that goes in
3035.4,and tickles pathways
because,they're there.
3041.06,I don't know what to say.
It's,a little shocking.
3044.769,- Yeah.
3048.602,"And at least in my laboratory,"
3050.07,I always say you never do an
experiment,"because you can,"
3053.04,you do an experiment to
test,a specific hypothesis.
3056.078,- Yeah. Yeah.
3056.911,"I mean, there are stories people tell"
3059.64,so that the vagus nerve
lands,on a particular spot
3063.91,on the brain called the
solitary,"tract nucleus,"
3065.97,which is just one snaps
away,from the serotonin
3069.24,and dopamine and the norepinephrine-
3070.44,- So there's a link to
chemical,systems in the brain-
3073.31,that make an irrational choice?
3074.77,- Yes.
3075.603,"It's not irrational,"
3076.436,but I can tell you that
even,"if that were not true,"
3079.41,the same thing would have been tried.
3080.676,[Andrew laughs]
3081.84,- You guys would have done it anyway.
3082.673,- Because it's accessible. Yeah.
3083.97,- [Andrew] I see. Okay.
3086.31,- And why?
3087.143,"Well, it's again, not to disparage"
3090.52,what's been happening in
this,branch of medicine.
3093.97,"There's immense suffering,"
many,"treatments don't work,"
3097.36,and we try things.
3100.585,And this is how so many
advances,in medicine happen.
3103.0,When think about kidney dialysis
3104.67,"which has kept many people alive,"
3106.98,"that was just started by someone saying,"
3108.307,"""Hey, let's try this."
3109.76,Maybe there's something
building,up in the blood
3111.52,and maybe we can dialyze
something,"and help them."""
3113.43,"Yeah, it worked."
3114.263,And it was just sort of
a,test pilot mentality.
3117.613,"We can access the blood,"
3119.72,"let's run it across a dialysis membrane,"
3121.76,"put it back in the body, oh"
my,"God, that actually works."
3123.95,And sometimes you do need
that,"test pilot mentality,"
3126.97,"of course, to do it in a rigorous, safe,"
3129.54,controlled way-
-,Sure.
3130.373,- which is what we do.
3131.206,"And so, anyway, that's how we ended up,"
3134.59,but still with the vagus
nerve,"stimulation, okay,"
3136.88,so what is it? Does it work?
3139.82,"It has, it's FDA approved for depression,"
3142.82,"this vagus nerve stimulation,"
but,"on a population level,"
3145.56,"if you average across all people,"
3148.17,the effect sizes are pretty small.
3150.78,"Some patients it has an amazing effect in,"
3153.69,"but some patients it doesn't work at all,"
3155.56,"and average across everybody,"
3157.22,the effect size is pretty small.
3158.54,- How do you think it's
working,when it does work?
3159.88,Is it triggering the activation of neurons
3162.46,that release more serotonin or dopamine?
3164.48,"- It could be, but I would"
say,we don't have evidence
3167.12,for that and so I just don't know.
3170.53,"But what is clear, is"
that,it's dose-limited
3174.3,in how high and strongly we can stimulate
3176.72,"and why, it's because it's an electrode,"
3178.97,and it's stimulating everything nearby.
3181.49,And when you turn on the
vagus,"nerve stimulator,"
3183.7,the patient's voice becomes
strangulated,"and hoarse,"
3187.25,"they can have trouble swallowing,"
3189.08,"they can have trouble speaking for sure,"
3191.36,"even some trouble breathing,"
because,"everything in the neck,"
3194.35,every electrically responsive cell
3196.42,and projection in the
neck,is being affected
3199.34,by this electrode.
3200.173,And so you can go up just
so,"far with the intensity,"
3204.07,and then you have to stop.
3205.74,"So, to your initial question,"
3208.02,could a more precise stimulation
method,like optogenetics
3212.11,help in the setting?
3213.45,"In principle, it could,"
3214.41,because if you would target
the,light sensitivity
3218.18,"to just the right kind of cell,"
3221.23,let's say cell X that goes
from,point A to point B
3224.11,"that you know, causes symptom"
relief,"of a particular kind,"
3227.44,then you're in business.
3228.29,You can have that be the only
cell,that's light sensitive.
3231.53,You're not going to affect
any,"of the other cells,"
3233.49,the larynx and the pharynx
3234.95,and the projections passing through.
3237.5,"So that's the hope,"
that's,the opportunity.
3239.01,"The problem, is that we"
don't,yet have that level
3241.99,of specific knowledge.
3242.93,"We don't know, okay, it's"
the,cells starting at point A
3245.75,"going to point B, that relieves"
this,particular symptom.
3249.23,- We want to fix this key on the piano?
3251.08,- Yeah.
3251.913,- And then I see two other
steps,that are required.
3254.99,One is to get the channelopsin
gene,into the cell.
3257.57,In the case of Botond Rosca and colleagues
3260.07,"rescuing vision in this patient,"
3263.43,they did that by an injection of a virus
3265.6,that doesn't damage the neurons.
3267.68,"The virus itself is fairly innocuous,"
3270.35,"but carries a cargo, and"
it's,"a one-time injection,"
3273.12,"the cells express, and then"
they,used light to stimulate.
3276.35,"So, let's say I'm depressed,"
which,"I don't think I am,"
3281.18,although now sitting in
front,"of a psychiatrist,"
3282.508,[Karl laughs]
3283.341,you probably can see signs that maybe I am
3284.96,"or maybe I'm not, but let's"
say,we put channelopsin
3288.65,into a specific branch of
the,vagus that we understand
3293.73,"is responsible for mood,"
3296.62,how are we going to get it in there?
3298.4,"And, then how are we going"
to,deliver the light?
3300.35,'Cause we're not talking about sunlight
3301.81,or standing in front of
a,"light bulb necessarily,"
3304.466,what are the mechanisms for the body?
3307.08,- Yeah.
3307.913,So we had to solve exactly
these,questions you're saying.
3309.99,How do you get the light in?
3310.97,"How do you get the gene in,"
3313.1,in a potent and robust and safe way?
3316.69,"And that's now solved, and"
that's,not a challenge.
3320.82,"So there are very safe,"
3322.5,well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms
3327.45,that are called
adeno-associated,"viruses, AAVs,"
3331.2,and these are things that are associated
3334.26,with the common cold.
3335.81,They themselves don't cause any symptoms.
3339.38,"They've been engineered, and"
there's,been a broad community
3342.18,of viral engineering that's
been,going on for decades
3344.7,"making these safer,"
"well-tolerated,",and so on.
3348.34,We can put the channelrhodopsin
gene,into these
3350.99,viral vectors that deliver the gene
3355.11,and we can have little
bits,of additional DNA
3357.6,that govern expression
only,"in one kind of cell,"
3360.05,but not another.
3360.883,"These are called promoters and enhancers,"
3363.21,all genetic tricks built up
by,a very broad community
3366.08,of great scientists over the decades.
3368.88,"We can put these different bits of DNA,"
3370.78,package them into this
"AAV,","this little virus,"
3373.84,and that can be then injected
3376.63,"into a particular part of the body,"
3380.075,and sticking with this
vagus,"nerve example,"
3383.26,we know that there are
particular,clumps of neurons.
3385.73,There's one called the nodose ganglion
3387.92,that has a clump of cells
related,"to the vagus nerve,"
3392.09,"and you could for example,"
target,a little injection
3394.78,into that ganglion-
3396.01,- Would that be an outpatient procedure?
3397.623,- Yep. Yep.
3398.456,- So you come in in the
"morning,","get your injection,"
3400.28,maybe walk out a few hours later?
3401.73,- Yeah. That's right.
3402.63,"And so that's the gene,"
3405.31,"then the light delivery,"
this,is also something
3407.56,that we've worked out.
3408.7,"We've worked on making very,"
very,light-sensitive opsins.
3412.69,"One challenge, and Botond would"
be,the first to state this
3417.53,"in fact, [chuckles] in solving"
this,"problem for the patient,"
3420.14,he had to build goggles that
created,much brighter light
3425.91,"than the normal ambient light delivery,"
3428.79,"because as I mentioned earlier,"
3430.64,you have to pack a lot of
these,"channelrhodopsins in,"
3433.97,they don't have much current.
3435.69,You have to really make sure
3437.26,that you've got a tense enough light
3439.56,to activate enough of them
to,cause a stimulation-
3441.724,- And it has to be the
right,"wavelength, right?"
3443.234,- It has to be the right wavelength-
3444.067,- And going back to your
example,of the algae
3445.44,"moving toward or away the light,"
3448.53,it has to be tuned just right.
3450.21,So I'm imagining in my
mind,"as a non-engineer,"
3454.45,I know you're [chuckles]
also,"a bioengineer,"
3458.1,I'm imagining a little tiny
blue,"light-emitting object,"
3464.46,that's a little bigger
than,"a clump of cells,"
3467.26,or maybe about the size
of,a clump of cells.
3469.41,"And for those that don't know,"
3471.81,your credit card is about 200
microns,"thick on the side,"
3476.61,and a micron is a
thousandths,"of a millimeter,"
3478.8,and so we're talking
about,a little tiny stamp
3483.42,that's basically half a
millimeter,in size all around.
3490.32,"Each edge, half a millimeter in size."
3492.4,I can imagine that
being,"put under my skin,"
3494.78,"and then I would what, I'd"
hit,"an app on my phone,"
3497.59,"and I'd say, ""Dr. Deisseroth,"
I'm,not feeling great today.
3502.25,"Can I increase the stimulation?"""
3503.72,"And you'd say, ""Go for it."""
3504.81,And then I'd ramp it up.
3505.71,Is that how it would go?
3506.57,"- I mean, that's effectively"
what,we already do
3508.26,with the vagus nerve stimulation.
3509.907,"The doctor in this case, and I have this"
3511.98,"in some of my patients in the clinic,"
3513.31,I do vagus nerve stimulation.
3514.54,"I talk to them, I say, ""How are you?"""
3515.95,"I go through the symptoms, I"
use,the psychiatric interview
3519.13,"to elicit their internal states,"
3521.26,and then I have a radio
frequency,controller
3524.11,that I can dial in-
3525.25,- Right there in real time?
3526.59,- Right there in real time.
3527.423,- You're holding the remote control
3528.48,"essentially to their brain,"
although,it's remote controlled?
3531.46,"- Yeah, through a couple"
of,"steps, but yeah."
3533.857,"And I can turn up the frequency,"
3536.531,"I can turn up the intensity,"
3538.46,"all with the radio frequency and control,"
3542.24,"and then it's reprogrammed or redosed,"
3545.733,and then the patient can then
leave,at this altered dose.
3549.04,- So this is happening now?
3550.1,- This is happening
right,"now, electrically."
3551.31,- You do this routinely?
3552.263,- I do it routinely in my
"clinic,","electrically, yeah."
3554.14,"- And you're getting the verbal content,"
3557.19,which as you described
"earlier,",is the indication
3560.93,of how well something
is,working in real time?
3563.113,- Yes.
3563.946,"- So this is what, maybe"
you,could just describe
3564.779,a little bit of the interaction
with,that particular patient
3567.175,"or another patient, what's a typical arc"
3570.1,of narrative as you go from no stimulation
3574.58,to increased stimulation?
3576.291,"- In most patients, the"
actual,"therapeutic effects,"
3579.57,the benefits actually
take,"many days to weeks,"
3583.05,and so what I'm mostly
focusing,on in the office
3586.64,"in real time, is making sure"
3588.46,"I'm in a safe, low side effect regime."
3591.2,And so first I talk to the patient
3592.931,who has been on a particular
dose,of the stimulation
3596.26,"for weeks or longer, and"
I,"talk about symptoms,"
3600.56,how were things over the past month?
3602.76,How was your hope?
3603.593,How was your energy level?
3605.03,Sleep? What is your mood?
3607.91,And then we talk with the patient
3609.53,"and we decide, well, this is"
not,yet where we'd like to be.
3612.32,"And so then, I can turn up the"
intensity,of the stimulation
3615.78,in real time in the office.
3616.763,"In most patients, I don't"
expect,an immediate mood change.
3621.15,"What I do, is I increase the"
dose,"until a next level up,"
3626.27,while asking the patient for side effects.
3628.13,Can you still breathe? Okay.
3629.51,Can you still swallow? Okay.
3630.85,And I can hear their voice as well.
3632.27,And I can get a sense-
3633.14,- And you're looking at their face?
3633.973,- And I'm looking at their face.
3634.806,- Yeah.
-,"And so I can get a sense,"
3637.55,am I still on a safe side effect regime?
3642.101,"And then, I stop at a particular"
point,"that looks safe,"
3645.92,and then the patient goes
"home,","comes back a month later,"
3649.54,and I get the report on how
things,were over that month.
3653.25,"- I asked if you're looking at their face,"
3654.99,"'cause in your book,"
3657.11,you describe the incredible complexity
3660.08,of social interactions.
3661.9,"And at one point,"
3664.38,you describe the incredible
amount,of information
3669.15,that the eyes inform about the brain
3672.34,and the context of
somebody's,"inner experience,"
3674.95,whether depressed or happy or otherwise.
3676.639,- Yeah.
3677.472,- I want to make sure that we
get,back to how to maneuver
3680.954,and manipulate the nervous system
3683.29,for the sake of mental health.
3686.204,"But, what are you looking for?"
3688.87,"So as a vision scientist,"
3690.3,I think pupils dilating
is,"a sign of arousal,"
3693.19,but that could be a positive
"arousal,","positive valence,"
3695.81,"like excitement, or it could be terror."
3698.31,- Yeah.
3699.143,- You're going to get the
same,dilation of the pupils.
3702.87,And I'm always reminding people
3703.703,that these two little goodies
are,"two pieces of brain,"
3705.93,"basically,"
[Karl,chuckles]
3706.763,they're just outside the cranial vault.
3707.96,So they're not unlike
the,"vagus in that sense,"
3709.82,but they're more of a
report,"than a control knob,"
3712.36,although I'd like to
think,they could be used
3714.75,as control knobs too.
3718.22,"So, without putting you on the spot,"
3719.63,"again, to diagnose me,"
[Karl,laughs]
3720.997,that's something I would
never,ask you to do
3723.089,[Karl laughing]
with,"the cameras rolling,"
3724.58,but what are you looking for
3727.0,that the patient might not be aware of?
3729.2,"In other words, can you see"
depression,in somebody's eyes?
3732.6,"And if you know a patient or if you don't,"
3735.25,can you see it in their body
posture,when they walk in?
3740.01,"Realizing of course, that"
a,trained psychiatrist
3742.41,"like yourself, develops an intuitive sense"
3745.31,that's aggregating lots of
different,"features of a patient,"
3749.06,but what about the eyes?
3750.28,What's going on there?
3751.33,- Yeah.
3752.163,The eyes are incredibly
rich,in information.
3754.62,"And as you alluded to though,"
3757.6,it's not as if any one measurable
3760.93,conveys all the information you need.
3762.48,It's what an engineer would
"say,",joint statistics.
3766.241,"It's many things all at once,"
3769.04,whether they're in synchrony
or,"out of synchrony,"
3771.73,that actually turns out to matter.
3774.74,"And the eye contact question,"
3778.01,we all know eye contact
is,incredibly important.
3780.16,You don't feel you've
connected,"with somebody,"
3782.65,"unless there's eye contact, but"
eye,contact can go awry too.
3788.039,"It can be too intense,"
3789.79,"or it can be mistimed, or if"
there's,"someone with autism,"
3795.58,it can be barely there at all.
3797.33,And this is one of the most
striking,"symptoms of autism,"
3801.22,"is the avoidance of eye contact,"
3808.58,almost as if it's a harmful quantity.
3811.94,And so there's an immense
amount,of information
3814.83,"you get from the eyes,"
3816.47,but it's the pairing of
what's,"going on in the eyes,"
3820.42,with everything else going
"on,","the body language,"
3823.21,the verbal content of what's coming out.
3826.94,All that together is the art of psychiatry
3830.608,and social interaction.
3833.21,But sometimes you don't
have,the eye contact.
3835.17,And this is an amazing thing
3836.31,and I do talk about this
in,the book as well.
3838.17,"In many cases in psychiatry,"
sometimes,it's over the phone
3841.67,that you have to make key decisions.
3844.15,"And as I recall, vividly"
being,"as a resident,"
3850.08,very often you have to
take,these phone calls
3852.77,"from people who are not in the hospital,"
3857.1,"people you can't see,"
you,"can't see their eyes,"
3859.327,you can't see their body
or,"anything about them,"
3861.71,just the sound of their voice.
3863.24,"And you can ask them questions,"
3864.75,"and you have to make, in some cases,"
3867.14,life or death decisions.
3868.53,Is this person truly suicidal?
3871.77,"Something like that, as"
it,comes up all the time.
3875.17,And so I developed over
the,"course of training,"
3879.489,"and I think all psychiatrists do this,"
3881.89,is you develop a way that
data,"stream you have,"
3885.02,whether it's the eyes or
whether,it's just the sound
3887.55,"of a voice coming over the phone,"
3889.57,you learn to hone in on
that,data stream you have
3891.76,and focus on it and identify changes
3896.211,and it's quite amazing.
3898.62,I found that you can actually...
3901.63,"If you know a patient, you can"
detect,very precise changes
3905.29,"in mood, just from the sound of the voice."
3907.22,And you can have a realization
3911.03,"that oh, this patient's"
depression,has improved
3914.62,"by about half, just by"
the,tone of their voice.
3918.63,"And same with eyes, with enough practice,"
3921.44,you can get enough information
from,a single data stream
3924.81,"to give you some information,"
3926.43,but when you do have the whole picture
3927.44,"of that, of course, is best."
3929.9,"- So, so many theories out"
there,about excessive blinking
3935.01,"and lying, lack of"
blinking,and sociopathy.
3939.0,I like to remind people
3940.08,that people have varying degrees
of,"lubrication of the eyes,"
3943.666,[Karl laughs]
which,also influence
3944.59,the frequency of blinking and
presumably,have nothing to do
3947.33,with whether or not what
they're,saying is true or not.
3950.65,"But incredible, nonetheless,"
that,the eyes are a portal
3954.15,to overall arousal state.
3956.56,I'm fascinated by the effects
of,light on circadian biology
3959.06,and just overall desire to be
awake,"or asleep, et cetera."
3964.19,So the eyes are on the
outside,of the cranial vault.
3966.48,The vagus is outside the
cranial,"vault, obviously."
3971.77,What about the goodies in here?
3975.65,"Parkinson's, we know at"
least,one of the major sites
3979.09,of degeneration and failure
that,lead to those symptoms.
3984.17,I can name off any number of other things.
3985.9,"In your book, you talk about"
the,beautiful work done
3987.81,with optogenetics of active
versus,"passive coping,"
3990.57,that there are areas of
the,brain like the habenula
3992.38,"that when active, make"
animals,"and presumably people,"
3996.43,"passive and unwilling, or"
uninterested,in fighting back
4000.93,"against pressures of life,"
whereas,"another region,"
4004.32,"the raphe, you stimulate"
"that,",and they actively cope.
4008.04,"They get their grit going,"
4009.56,and they are able to lean into life.
4011.91,"So, how does one get to those"
structures,in a focused way?
4017.58,And what does the next two to
"five,",to 10 years look like?
4023.52,"- Well, this is the promise on that,"
4025.46,and it is on a timescale
4028.26,that I think things may start to play out.
4032.52,The specificity of optogenetics
is,really only useful
4036.56,if you have some idea of
how,to use that specificity.
4040.5,"And actually, it's a"
frustrating,aspect of psychiatry
4044.76,"that in many cases, the most"
effective,"treatments we have,"
4048.96,"have the least specificity,"
4050.97,electroconvulsive therapy
being,"a great example,"
4053.33,where you're causing a brainwide-
4054.92,"- Which looks barbaric, but"
as,you mentioned is effective.
4057.71,"- I mean, it is."
4059.05,"These days, it's much"
more,clinically safe-
4061.68,- It doesn't look like one
fluid,there last seen in the lab
4063.803,[indistinct]
-,No it doesn't.
4065.3,Now it's a very clinically
safe,"and stable procedure,"
4069.377,"but I would say yeah,"
4071.503,it's got this almost
medieval,"lack of specificity,"
4076.27,even if the procedure is
well-controlled,and clinically safe
4079.21,"and stable, and it's not very specific."
4082.74,You're causing a brainwide seizure.
4084.27,How could you be less specific than that?
4086.26,- And we don't know the
source,of the relief.
4089.02,- [Karl] We don't know-
4089.894,- Presumably it's a
dump,of neuromodulators
4091.35,"like dopamine and serotonin,"
but,we don't really know-
4093.541,- There certainly is a
dump,of neuromodulators.
4094.91,We don't know that that's
the,cause for the relief.
4098.21,"And likewise with medications,"
4100.24,this is an awesome and interesting thing.
4103.53,Some of the most
effective,"antidepressants,"
4106.17,some of the most effective anti-psychotics
4108.24,are the ones that have
the,most side effects
4110.74,and there are many examples of this.
4112.56,"For example, the most"
effective,anti-psychotic
4115.2,"is something called clozapine,"
4118.242,which unquestionably has
the,most side effects.
4119.79,"It has terrible, terrible side effects."
4120.887,- The D4 antagonist?
4122.36,- It has basically
every,receptor. [laughs]
4124.88,- Does it really?
4125.713,- Yeah.
-,Interesting.
4126.86,"- Yeah, it has prominent"
"serotonin,","prominent muscarinic,"
4131.04,"certainly acts on dopamine receptors,"
4132.88,but it causes blood cell
counts,change- [laughs]
4138.047,- How do people feel?
4139.4,So if I were schizophrenic
4142.07,and I was getting auditory
"hallucinations,","et cetera,"
4145.24,"and I took clozapine, what"
could,I expect to feel?
4150.88,"- Well, so you would notice side effects,"
4153.57,and you would notice resolution
of,symptoms both and-
4156.55,- So the voices would go away?
4157.87,- Yeah.
4158.703,"- But in a good situation,"
4159.674,the voices would go away?
-,That's right.
4161.43,- But I would feel not good in my body?
4163.72,"- You might have dizziness,"
4166.29,"you might have drooling,"
you,might have any number
4171.04,of physical sensations
that,would be due to these
4177.08,"off target effects, the medication acting"
4179.39,on these other receptors-
4180.67,"- I'm certainly not suggesting this,"
4181.82,but what if somebody without
schizophrenia,took clozapine?
4185.18,- They'd have the same side
effects,"presumably, yeah."
4187.432,And so it would not be something
that,I would recommend.
4190.621,- Yeah.
4191.454,Do psychiatrists take the
drugs,that they prescribe?
4193.16,[Karl laughs]
4193.993,"I just finished for the third time,"
4195.76,Oliver Sacks' autobiography
which,is marvelous
4199.333,and I highly recommend to people.
4202.12,"He certainly took a lot of drugs,"
4205.03,"not as part of his professional role,"
4208.07,"but just out of curiosity,"
what,is the interest
4211.7,or kind of role of drugs
in,the field of psychiatry?
4215.0,Because I would imagine for a group
4216.61,of very curious introspective people
4219.2,who are making recommendations
about,"what to take,"
4221.65,there could actually be some
benefit,for understanding
4224.28,what the experience of
those,drugs was like
4226.49,for their patients.
4227.37,- I think that's true.
4229.017,And I will say that probably
many,or most psychiatrists
4232.24,have sampled the number of
these,for exactly the reason
4236.43,that you're saying is to understand better
4238.56,and to help treat their patients better.
4241.305,And I've spoken to people
4245.954,"who have found this very helpful to know,"
4247.06,"okay, this sleep disruption"
caused,by this medication
4250.35,or the libido disruption caused
by,this other medication.
4253.27,"Wow, that is a big effect."
4255.126,And it really helps with empathy
4257.68,for the patients to understand.
4259.514,- I'm not suggesting that
physicians,or anybody
4264.53,"experiment with drugs, but"
I,"am relieved to hear that,"
4267.48,because I think that when you're talking
4268.82,about accessing somebody's mind
and,"their basic physiology,"
4272.58,"as you've mentioned, relate"
to,"appetite, libido and sleep,"
4275.54,"really, one is acting as a mechanic"
4278.74,of the person's whole experience.
4280.83,They walk out of the office
and,they have a life experience
4284.36,that extends beyond the script.
4285.88,- Yeah.
4287.06,"And so at the same time though,"
4290.42,you can't let that completely
guide,"your clinical decisions,"
4292.78,"because as I mentioned,"
some,of these medications
4295.36,"that have the most side effects,"
4296.47,they are also the most effective
4298.2,and clozapine is a great example.
4299.62,That will work in patients
where,nothing else works.
4302.51,"And believe me, we don't take the step"
4304.59,"of clozapine prescription lightly,"
4306.81,because of all these side effects.
4308.31,You have to come in for
a,"weekly blood cell,"
4310.68,"or every few weeks of blood cell check,"
4312.47,to make sure that the blood
counts,"are not off for example,"
4315.82,but there are patients where
no,other medication works
4318.62,for the schizophrenia and
clozapine,works amazingly well-
4320.734,- That's marvelous.
4321.767,"- And so we do it, even though"
there,are the side effects.
4325.32,And so then this comes
back,"to your question,"
4327.34,what if we had better
and,better specificity?
4329.86,"Well, only if we know exactly"
what,we're doing is the point.
4332.757,"And so because as we become more refined,"
4335.92,we'd better be right about
where,we we're refining to..
4339.28,- And do you imagine
a,day where it will be
4341.05,"a single, maybe even"
outpatient,"neurosurgery,"
4344.32,would go in through the
skull,"or the back of the ear,"
4346.4,deliver a small viral injection
4347.607,"of one of these adenoviruses,"
4349.58,"a little sticker of light-emitting diode,"
4353.67,"deep in the brain, is that"
how,you envision this someday?
4356.61,- That certainly could happen.
4357.72,What I actually prefer as a
vision,"is still medications,"
4363.96,because those are minimally invasive.
4368.76,"If we knew what we were doing,"
4369.89,"we could make them more specific,"
have,"fewer side effects,"
4373.97,"but optogenetics, that will arm us"
4376.13,with true causal understanding.
4378.06,"And so we'll know,"
4380.02,and we're already moving
rapidly,"toward this point,"
4382.48,"we'll know okay, this symptom,"
4385.51,loss of pleasure in life
that,"we call anhedonia,"
4388.3,or the loss of motivation or energy
4392.22,"to overcome challenges, active coping,"
4395.36,"these are largely subserved,"
largely,controlled
4399.54,by this circuit or that
circuit,or the cell
4402.033,that inhabits this other circuit.
4404.21,- And we will know that
because,of the work done
4406.63,with channelopsins?
4407.463,- Exactly.
-,Yeah. I agree.
4408.78,- In ways that we never could
have,the confidence otherwise.
4412.3,And so we'll know that this is the circuit
4414.304,that underlies the
symptom,or its resolution.
4418.61,And then we'll get to understand
these,"cells very deeply,"
4422.95,"okay, these cells that are"
"causal,","that do matter,"
4426.56,who are they? What's their wiring?
4428.86,What are the proteins that they make?
4431.17,What are the little things
that,are on the surface
4434.07,of the cell that could be
receptors,for specific medications
4437.62,or combinations of receptors
4440.33,that would give us the
specificity,we need?
4442.87,"And then, armed with"
that,causal and precise
4446.59,"and rigorous knowledge,"
then,you can imagine
4449.02,medication development
becoming,"totally different,"
4451.05,"no longer serendipitous, but"
truly,grounded in causality.
4455.41,- I see.
4456.243,So using channelopsins as a
way,to probe the circuitry
4459.19,and figure out the sites
that,"are disrupted,"
4462.97,what patterns of activity are required?
4464.91,"And then, by understanding the"
constituents,"of those cells,"
4468.39,"like what they express and what they make,"
4470.04,then developing drugs that
could,"target those cells,"
4472.86,not necessarily putting
light-inducing,diodes
4475.31,"into the brain, or walking"
around,with wire packs
4478.2,attached to our skull
or,something like that.
4479.886,- [Karl] Right. Exactly.
4480.89,- That's fantastic.
4482.35,"And I realized no one has a crystal ball,"
4486.45,but what do you think the arc of that is?
4490.35,"Meaning, are we going"
to,see that in a year?
4493.03,In two years? Three years?
4495.41,Let me reframe that.
4497.49,How soon will a pill-based treatment
4500.87,"for a psychiatric disease be available,"
4503.1,that targets a specific set of cells
4506.37,that we know are important
because,of the work done
4510.2,with channelopsins?
4511.95,- I think that in some
ways,it's already happening
4516.95,at the level of individual patients-
4520.045,- Here at Stanford?
4521.01,- Yeah. Yup.
4522.614,"And more broadly in terms of new drugs,"
4526.49,new multi-centered clinical
trials,that will play out
4530.64,over the next few years.
4533.16,And these could be drugs
that,are already safe
4536.32,"and approved for other purposes,"
4539.42,"but we might say okay, now we know"
4541.83,"that this medication,"
based,on what we know
4545.95,"from causal optogenetics,"
this,could be useful
4549.23,"for this other purpose,"
this,psychiatric symptom.
4552.74,And so the path to helping patients
4556.53,could be relatively swift.
4559.02,- That's very exciting.
4560.75,What are your thoughts about
brain,machine interface
4563.92,"and Neuralink always comes up,"
4566.76,although I do want to point
out,a tremendous respect
4569.69,for the folks at Neuralink
4570.78,including someone who
came,"up through my lab,"
4572.53,"is now there as a neurosurgeon,"
4573.73,but the brain machine
interface,is something
4576.97,"that's been happening for a long time now,"
4579.21,"some of the best work, among"
the,best work being done here
4582.58,"at Stanford and elsewhere too of course,"
4585.75,is what you just described compatible with
4588.02,"or different than brain machine interface,"
4589.77,"meaning devices, little"
probes,are going to stimulate
4592.56,different patterns of activity
and,ensembles of neurons?
4595.44,And what are your general thoughts
4596.73,about brain machine
interfaces,going forward?
4601.25,"- I mean, first of all,"
4603.379,it's an amazing scientific
discovery,"approach,"
4607.28,"as you mentioned, we and"
others,here at Stanford
4609.41,"are using electrodes,"
collecting,information
4612.18,from tens of thousands of neurons-
4614.53,"- In humans, I should"
add.,Yeah. [chuckles]
4616.38,"- And even, yes, it is quite even separate"
4620.36,"from the Neuralink work as you point out,"
4622.17,many people have been
doing,"this in humans,"
4625.15,as well as in non-human primates.
4627.81,And this is pretty
"powerful,",it's important.
4630.84,This will let us understand
what's,"going on in the brain,"
4633.74,in psychiatric disease
and,"neurological disease,"
4638.18,and will give us ideas for treatment.
4641.9,"It is, of course still invasive."
4644.527,You still are talking about
putting,a device into the brain.
4650.13,And that has to be treated
4654.21,"as a situation that has some risks,"
4656.81,and a step that has to be taken carefully.
4660.63,I see that as something
4662.27,that will be part of
psychiatry,"in the long run,"
4667.97,already with deep brain
stimulation,"approaches,"
4671.05,we can help people with
psychiatric,disorders.
4674.68,And that's putting just
a,"single electrode,"
4676.56,not even a complex closed loop system
4680.31,where you're both playing in
and,"getting information back,"
4682.83,even just a single stimulation
electrode,in the brain
4686.0,"can help people with OCD, for"
"example,",quite powerfully.
4691.24,And that will become much more powerful
4692.71,when we get to a true
brain,"machine interface,"
4695.01,"collecting information back,"
4697.37,stimulating only when you need to.
4698.94,If we could identify a
pathological,"activity pattern,"
4703.34,"a particular, almost like the prodrome"
4705.67,"or the early stage of a seizure,"
4707.14,maybe there are events
that,happened leading up to
4710.34,"on some timescale, a psychiatric symptom"
4714.213,that we could intervene
in,a closed loop way
4717.3,"to detect what's happening,"
what's,"starting to go wrong,"
4720.26,feed that back to the brain
stimulation,"electrode,"
4723.31,have it be in that way more
efficient,and more principled.
4729.21,I think it's great.
4730.37,It's something that of
course,will be grounded again
4733.45,"and causal understanding,"
we'll,"need to know,"
4735.13,what is that pathological
pattern,that we're detecting?
4737.64,And we need to know that it matters.
4739.05,"And so again, that's where"
optogenetics,is helping us.
4740.933,"It's helping us know, okay,"
this,pattern of activity
4744.21,in these cells and these
"circuits,",this does mean
4747.84,that there's a particular kind
of,symptom that's happening.
4752.22,"But armed with that knowledge, absolutely,"
4753.991,even the simple closed loop
device,detect and stimulate
4757.6,is going to be part of
psychiatry,in the future.
4759.352,"And then of course, as"
you,"get to more cells,"
4762.64,"more connections, the ability"
that,we have to help people
4765.83,will become more powerful.
4768.06,- One of the questions I get
asked,a lot is about ADHD
4772.16,and attention deficit of various kinds.
4775.02,"I have a hunch, that one"
reason,I get asked so often
4779.21,is that people are feeling
really,distracted and challenged
4784.01,in funneling their attention
and,their behavior.
4789.501,And there are number of
reasons,"for that, of course,"
4791.25,"but what is true ADHD, and"
what,does it look like?
4796.52,What can be done for it?
4798.02,And what if any role for channelopsins
4801.39,or these downstream technologies
that,"you're developing,"
4804.75,what do they offer for
people,that suffer from ADHD
4808.47,or have a family member
that,suffers from ADHD?
4812.61,- This is a pretty interesting
branch,of psychiatry.
4816.333,There's no question that
people,have been helped
4818.66,"by the treatments, there's active debate"
4822.64,over what fraction of people
who,have these symptoms
4827.69,can or should be treated?
4829.86,- This is typically Adderall
or,stimulants of some kind?
4832.35,"- Yeah, for example the"
"stimulants,",that's right.
4834.71,So ADHD as its name
"suggests,","it has symptoms of,"
4839.49,it can have either a hyperactive state
4841.91,"or an inattentive state,"
4844.41,and those can be completely
separate,from each other.
4848.07,You could have a patient who effectively
4851.72,"is not hyperactive at all,"
but,can remain focused
4855.05,on what's going on around them-
4857.08,"- So the body can be still,"
4858.47,but their mind is darting around?
4860.63,- That's right.
4861.463,- Or they can be very
hyperactive,with their body.
4863.34,"- Yeah, it happens both ways."
4864.173,- Probably rarely is somebody
hyperactive,with their body
4866.12,"but their mind is still,"
4867.23,[Karl laughs]
although,"I have to say,"
4868.063,and this is a benevolent
shout,"out to Botond Rosca,"
4870.82,Botond has an incredibly
sharp,and focused mind.
4874.81,- Yeah.
4875.643,- And his hand movements
4876.568,[Karl laughs]
are,"extremely exact also,"
4877.98,"so I do sometimes wonder, whether or not"
4880.63,"our body movements and our head movements,"
4882.463,whether or not they're coordinated or not
4884.33,is a readout of how
directed,our attention is.
4888.54,"- I noticed, I have to think"
"complex,",abstract thoughts.
4891.4,I noticed I have to be very still.
4892.97,So my body has to be
almost,completely on moving
4896.02,for me to think very
abstractly,and deeply.
4899.62,Other people are different.
4900.62,"Some people, when they're running,"
4901.79,they get their best thoughts.
4902.8,I can't even imagine that.
4904.1,My brain does not work that way at all.
4905.88,"I have to be totally motionless, [laughs]"
4907.86,which is kind of interesting.
4908.87,- How do you go about that?
4910.04,"- I sit much like this, I"
try,to have time in each day
4916.15,where I'm literally sitting
almost,"in this position,"
4921.98,"but without distraction and thinking,"
4924.21,and so it's almost
meditative,"in some ways,"
4927.44,"except it's not true meditation,"
4930.44,"but I am thinking, well, I'm not moving-"
4933.134,- You're trying to structure
your,thoughts in that time?
4935.644,- Yeah.
4936.477,- Interesting.
-,Yeah.
4937.55,"So, but everybody, as you"
say,is very different.
4940.76,"And so with ADHD, the key"
thing,is we want to make sure
4944.61,that this is present across
different,"domains of life,"
4948.77,"school and home, to show that it really"
4951.05,"is a pervasive pattern,"
and,not something specific
4954.2,to the teacher or the home
situation,or something.
4958.03,And then you can help patients.
4959.19,It's interesting that ADHD
is,one of those disorders
4962.58,where people are trying to work
4963.91,"on quantitative EEG-based diagnoses,"
4966.63,and so there's some progress
4968.36,toward making a diagnosis
looking,"at particular,"
4972.75,externally detectable brainwave rhythm-
4975.33,- So skullcap with some electrodes
4977.07,that don't penetrate the skull?
4978.3,- That's right.
4979.133,- And this can be done in
an,hour or two-hour session?
4981.447,"- Yeah, that's right."
4982.28,"- It has to be done in a clinic, right?"
4983.97,"- Yeah, in the clinic, right,"
4985.087,and you have to have the
right,recording apparatus
4987.06,"and so on,"
4990.503,"but in principle, increase"
in,confidence comes
4993.42,in exactly which measurements
one,could even imagine
4998.39,"moving toward home tests,"
but,we're not there yet.
5002.46,- Amazing.
5003.293,I think one of the reasons
I,get asked about it so much
5005.16,is a lot of people
wonder,if they have ADHD.
5008.01,Do you think that some
of,the lifestyle factors
5010.86,"that inhabit us all these days,"
5014.51,could induce a subclinical
or,a clinical-like ADHD?
5020.39,I look at people's phone
use,"including my own,"
5022.74,"and I don't think of it like addiction,"
5024.5,it looks to me and feels
to,me more like OCD.
5027.13,And I'll come clean here by
saying,"when I was younger,"
5028.97,"when I was a kid, I had a grunting tic."
5031.36,I used to hide it.
5032.193,"I actually used to hide in the closet,"
5033.53,'cause my dad would make me stop.
5037.536,And I couldn't feel any relief of my mind
5039.23,until I [grunts] would do this.
5040.59,"And actually now, if I get very tired,"
5042.95,if I've been pushing long
"hours,",it'll come back.
5045.153,- Interesting.
5045.986,"- I was not treated for it,"
5048.09,but I will confess that
I've,had the experience
5051.27,"of, I always liked sports where"
I,"involved a lot of impact,"
5054.49,"fortunately not football,"
because,I went to a high school
5056.96,where the football team was terrible.
5058.47,"Maybe that would have avoided more impact,"
5060.093,[Karl laughs]
5060.926,"but things like skateboarding, boxing,"
5063.01,they bring relief.
5064.64,I feel clarity after a
head,"hit, which I avoid,"
5067.764,[Karl laughs]
5068.597,but I used to say that's the only time
5070.12,I feel truly clear for a while.
5071.74,And then eventually it dissipated.
5073.23,"By about age 16, 17, it just disappeared."
5076.89,So I have great empathy
for,those that feel
5080.03,like there's something contained in them
5081.65,that won't allow them to focus
5082.88,on what they want to focus on.
5084.62,"And these days, with the phone"
5086.53,"and all these email, et cetera, I wonder"
5090.81,and I empathize a bit
when,I hear people saying
5093.26,"like, ""I think I might have ADHD or ADD""."
5097.56,Do you think it's possible
that,our behaviors
5100.25,and our interaction
with,"the sensory world,"
5102.63,which is really what phones
and,"email really are,"
5104.95,could induce ADD or reactivate it?
5108.744,- This is a great question.
5110.47,"I think about it a lot,"
5112.53,and you mentioned this
tic-like,"behavior in yourself,"
5116.61,it's very common that people who have tics
5119.33,have this building up of something
that,can only be relieved
5121.87,by executing the tic which
can,be a motor movement
5125.38,or a vocalization or even a thought.
5130.9,"And people do, I think"
these,"days, do have this."
5132.63,If they haven't checked
their,"phone in a while,"
5134.35,they do have a buildup
and,buildup and buildup
5136.19,until they can check it and relieve it.
5138.918,"And there's some similarities,"
5141.11,there is a little reward
that,comes with the checking.
5146.32,"But the key question in all of psychiatry,"
5148.86,what we do is we don't diagnose something
5151.03,unless it's disrupting what we call social
5155.02,or occupational functioning.
5156.34,Like you could have
any,"number of symptoms,"
5159.23,but literally every
psychiatric,diagnosis requires
5163.66,that it has to be
disrupting,someone's social
5166.71,or occupational functioning.
5168.44,"And these days, checking your"
phone,is pretty adaptive.
5171.07,That pretty much helps your social
5172.89,and occupational functioning.
5174.03,And so we can't make [chuckles]
it,a psychiatric diagnosis.
5178.81,- Interesting.
5179.643,- At least in the world of today.
5182.04,"- Yeah, opting out of communication now,"
5184.44,"makes you in some ways less adaptive,"
5187.44,though I would point to you as an example
5189.85,of somebody who is quite good
at,"managing his interactions,"
5194.53,"at least from the outsider perspective,"
5196.79,I do want to ask you a
little,bit about you.
5199.56,"And first of all, and I realize"
this,"is only a partial list,"
5204.97,"but you're a clinician, you see patients,"
5208.13,"you run a big laboratory,"
5209.26,how many people are in
your,laboratory now?
5211.5,That's a huge laboratory.
5213.87,"From experience, I can say"
that's,an enormous laboratory.
5218.849,"You have a family of five children,"
5220.98,and you're happily married to
a,wonderful colleague of ours
5223.84,"as well, who does incredible work."
5229.7,How do you organize at a
kind,"of conceptual level,"
5233.98,the day and the week?
5236.64,"And I should say, what stress"
mitigation,"practices if any,"
5240.79,do you incorporate?
5241.75,I've received emails from
you,at three in the morning.
5244.58,I sometimes send emails
at,"three in the morning,"
5246.24,but that's when I wake
"up,","maybe I'm depressed,"
5248.45,but I go back to sleep.
5250.1,"So, maybe just describe"
the,arc of the blocks
5254.34,"of the day, not hour by hour,"
5255.99,necessarily the details of
what,"are in those blocks,"
5258.27,but how do you conceptualize the day?
5261.16,How do you conceptualize the week?
5263.58,And how do you feel
about,how that's lined up
5267.96,with your larger goals
5269.43,of making sure these five
young,people flourish?
5273.94,"Which I hear they are,"
5276.16,but how do you go about
"this,",what for most people
5278.713,would just be an
overwhelming,set of items?
5284.866,"- Well, of course sometimes"
it's,"just take it day by day,"
5289.38,and so I don't claim-
5290.87,- So you bring the horizon
into,the unit of the day?
5293.16,"- I do, I do."
5295.28,"The unit is the day, that's right."
5296.78,And I try to have in each
"day,","as I mentioned earlier,"
5303.38,at least an hour of
time,"where I can think,"
5308.034,"and it can be when kids are napping,"
5312.367,"actually, because while"
driving,"I can do that too,"
5315.18,"because I'm sitting still, [clears throat]"
5318.02,but that's the one
thing,I try to preserve.
5322.37,When I was writing the
"book,",I adapted that time
5325.04,"to be my writing time,"
but,"it wasn't enough,"
5330.547,so I had to add in a new block of time
5332.18,which was sort of midnight
to,"2:00 AM, writing time."
5337.622,[chuckles] And carving out
"these,",even small protected times
5342.73,are very important.
5344.89,"Of course, obligations will expand"
5348.34,to fill the time available and
you,have to be disciplined.
5351.49,At least I found I had to be disciplined
5353.411,in truly protecting those
times,where one can think.
5358.19,- So that means no phone?
5359.66,"- That means no phone,"
no,checking of the phone.
5364.346,"When I was writing the book,"
5368.72,there's a focus mode on the MacBook
5372.63,"which kind of rules the border,"
5375.98,and you just have your
documents,"and it's very pure,"
5379.55,and you don't have the
temptation,of distraction.
5383.79,- I'm a big believer in because
the,vision and the eyes play
5387.72,such a prominent role in
directing,"our cognition,"
5389.76,"something you talk about in the book,"
5392.32,"really beautifully, and with"
a,"lot of depth and rigor,"
5396.16,using visual tools
5398.74,to harness one's complete
mental,attention.
5401.86,When you do this practice of
sitting,"and just thinking,"
5404.51,"sitting still and thinking,"
you,said your eyes are open.
5408.59,"Are you hearing your own verbal voice,"
5411.73,although in your head?
-,Yes.
5413.12,- So you're actually in
conversation,with yourself?
5415.4,- Yes.
5416.233,"And hearing literally, I"
"mean,","not quite literally,"
5418.31,"I don't actually hear information,"
but,"I'm hearing words,"
5422.54,and so I discovered this about myself.
5425.58,"Other people, I think"
may,"operate differently,"
5429.64,but I'm extremely verbal in how I think.
5432.35,That's how all my reasoning is done.
5433.9,It's with sentences and
[chuckles],construction
5439.219,of almost equations with words.
5441.16,- Complete sentences?
5442.32,- Complete sentences
or,"complete-ish anyway,"
5444.98,"mostly complete, and"
when,"writing the book,"
5447.78,"everything about the writing,"
5450.6,every sentence was always
played,"out in my mind,"
5454.2,"listening for rhythm and timing,"
5456.9,and I would obsess over
exact,placement of words
5461.3,to get the right rhythm of the
spoken,sentence in my mind.
5464.91,"- I don't mean to interrupt your flow,"
5466.4,"but when you do that, and"
having,experienced this process
5470.01,"a bit, although differently,"
5472.35,do you experience any kind
of,welling up of anxiety
5475.23,when you're hitting the friction points?
5478.34,"And if so, do you have tools or ways"
5481.59,that you quell that anxiety in real time?
5484.1,'Cause what we're really
talking,about here is your mind.
5487.01,But what we're really
talking,about is this process
5489.14,"of converting the activity of neurons,"
5492.94,into something physically
concrete,in the world.
5496.29,And these intermediate steps
are,so mysterious to everybody.
5499.54,"We hear, ""Just write the book"","
5501.077,"""Just do it"", whatever that means."
5503.22,"In fact, statements like that to me"
5504.52,"are kind of empty and meaningless,"
5507.06,but when you hear your voice
5509.44,and you're trying to find the correct word
5511.64,"and you keep hitting, it"
doesn't,"sound quite right,"
5515.72,what is the experience in your body?
5518.21,"- Yeah, when it's not right,"
it's,"definitely evasive,"
5523.12,"it doesn't feel good,"
5527.587,but there's also a hope because
I,"know I can solve it too,"
5534.541,and it's almost like you're almost there.
5536.64,"There's a path that you know is there,"
5539.26,"you don't quite see it, but it's there."
5542.55,"And I keep that in mind,"
5546.985,and so there's this
propulsive,force forward
5549.64,because I know that the solution is there.
5552.764,"And that said, there were single words"
5556.67,"that I would spend days on,"
5559.64,because I was just not
happy,until I got it right.
5562.42,And there were some things
that,"I never quite got perfect,"
5565.42,and so I left out of the book entirely
5567.13,"because it was so close,"
but,not quite there.
5570.46,"And I was like, no, I can't put that in."
5573.68,- Everything you just said
is,entirely consistent
5575.48,"with my experience of you,"
5577.144,[both laughing]
5578.28,and the way you go about everything.
5580.95,"I have to ask, are your kids writers?"
5583.01,Do they like books and words and poetry?
5585.28,I know one of your children is going on
5587.2,to a career in medicine and science.
5589.29,- Yeah.
5590.123,"They're each different which is amazing,"
5591.73,"yet they all, I think do"
have,some appreciation
5594.45,"or a lot of appreciation for reading,"
5597.17,but some are very musical.
5599.05,"Two of the five are extremely musical,"
5601.5,"very, very talented with"
guitar,"and singing and vocal,"
5606.15,"impressions, it's just astonishing."
5608.93,And some of them are great
with,drawing and artistry
5612.95,and some are very physical and vigorous
5615.7,and are never happy
except,when leaping about.
5619.38,"And so, it's just amazing how"
different,"they are, honestly."
5622.46,But I think there is a shared
appreciation,for language.
5626.09,- Do you think that one
can,train their mind
5629.95,in using these practices?
5633.4,I really like your description
5634.233,of the staying physically still
5637.1,and learning to grapple
with,those challenges.
5640.66,"It's something that, especially"
in,"laboratory science,"
5643.18,we aren't really trained to do.
5645.55,Like many professions
we're,taught to come in
5647.44,"and just get into motion, and"
I,found that very relaxing
5650.74,as someone who probably
has,an underlying tic
5653.133,[Karl chuckles]
or,"something like that,"
5654.04,it felt great to be in motion.
5655.38,One of the hardest things
5656.213,about becoming a university
professor,"and running a lab,"
5658.93,was that I no longer
working,with my hands.
5661.71,And it felt like some big
important,part of my life
5666.67,had been amputated.
5668.18,But what sorts of practices
do,you incorporate there?
5671.14,And do you think people can
learn,to get better at focusing
5675.54,through a dedicated practice
of,the sort that you described?
5682.835,- I remember the rhythms of physical work
5686.18,in the laboratory very well.
5689.34,My work these days as
the,"laboratory leader,"
5694.25,my job has returned mostly
to,"words now, again."
5697.07,And so it's kind of coming full circle.
5703.313,So it's a different mode.
5704.41,I think you just have to
embrace,the different stages
5707.58,"of life, come with the different modes,"
5709.26,but you can definitely train
yourself,for each mode.
5714.586,"I loved, as I mentioned,"
the,rhythm of sewing
5720.05,"and suturing and surgery,"
5723.69,and I worked really hard on
that,and became good at it.
5728.02,"And now, I never do it, but"
it's,what's the next challenge.
5731.71,There's all the various
experimental,techniques
5733.75,"the dissections of the brain,"
5736.12,I can't tell you how many
thousands,of brain dissections
5739.24,"I've done in my life, and"
now,I don't do them at all.
5741.227,[Karl laughs]
5742.06,- And then you developed a method
5742.893,so that we don't have to dissect brains.
5744.141,- That's right. [chuckles]
-,"As you mentioned there,"
5744.974,"maybe tell us for a moment about clarity,"
5746.84,and for people who will
probably,never set foot
5750.65,"into a laboratory, what an incredible,"
5753.87,yet another incredible discovery
and,"development clarity is,"
5759.14,and why it helps us understand
how,the brain is structured.
5762.41,- Yeah.
5763.243,So this is a different technology
also,developed in my lab
5766.46,"here, and it's part of a broader approach"
5770.04,that we call hydrogel-tissue chemistry.
5772.28,"And what this is, is it's building a gel,"
5775.32,like a clear jello-like substance
from,within all the cells
5780.27,of a tissue or even an
"animal,",all at once.
5785.192,So you're effectively building a gel
5786.47,inside all the cells at once.
5788.87,"Now, that's an odd thing to do."
5790.97,Why do we do it?
5791.803,"Well, we do it to transform the tissue"
5796.34,into a more tractable accessible object.
5799.89,And the reason that works
is,"having built this gel,"
5803.21,"this new infrastructure inside the tissue,"
5807.17,"we can then use chemical tricks,"
5808.76,and we can link the
molecules,"we care about,"
5811.46,like proteins or RNAs
which,"are the things,"
5815.53,"as you know, right before"
they,"become proteins,"
5818.0,"we can link them, physically"
anchor,"them to this gel,"
5823.07,"which is a scaffold basically,"
5824.51,it's an interlocking network of polymers.
5828.0,We can link all these
interesting,"molecules in place,"
5830.68,lock them in where they were
initially,"in the tissue,"
5833.94,"in the cell, in all the cells."
5836.43,"And then we can remove very vigorously,"
5838.55,everything we don't care about
that's,"blocking our light,"
5841.88,"that's blocking our molecules,"
5843.48,coming in to exchange
information,with the tissue.
5846.57,We can get rid of everything
"else,","like the lipids,"
5848.98,"the fats, we can"
effectively,use detergents
5851.6,"to get them all out,"
and,then we can see in
5854.71,all the things that were
absorbing,or scattering light
5857.21,"are gone, you can have a brain"
5858.85,"that's completely transparent,"
5860.81,"and yet, all the interesting"
molecules,are still locked
5862.97,"into place there, at the"
cellular,and sub cellular level.
5865.91,And so this is hydrogel-tissue chemistry.
5867.65,The first form we described
was,called clarity.
5870.76,"We use that quite a bit still,"
5872.48,"but there are many variants now,"
5874.28,that we and others have
developed,on this basic concept
5876.95,of building this gel within the tissue
5879.04,and anchoring molecules into place.
5880.59,- Literally glass-clear brains.
5882.17,"I've done this, I've taken a"
brain,"cleared with this method,"
5885.36,"and looked at somebody through it,"
5886.695,[Karl laughing]
5887.528,and although you don't want to
get,"it too close to your eye,"
5888.83,you don't want to touch
it,"to your own eye,"
5891.02,and you can see direct
all,the way through it.
5893.47,- [Karl] Yeah.
5896.33,- That's incredible for it
raises,"an important question,"
5899.75,"which is again, about the human brain,"
5901.57,and as somebody who essentially
started,out in neuroanatomy
5904.85,"and then got into other things,"
5908.16,I always am bothered by the
fact,that we actually know
5912.29,very little about the
microstructure,"of the human brain,"
5915.8,compared to the brains of other organisms.
5918.177,- Yeah.
5919.01,- And in thinking about
understanding,the circuitry
5921.43,"and the piano, so to speak"
and,how to manipulate it
5924.9,"in order to relieve suffering,"
5929.47,"one wonders, are the structures"
in,these animal brains
5934.64,"and how they behave, and"
active,"coping, passive coping,"
5937.687,"ADD, et cetera, those models,"
how,well they translate
5942.12,to the human condition.
5943.95,Do you think it's fair to say
that,there are entire regions
5946.63,of the human brain that
aren't,"just bigger,"
5949.48,but that exist only in
the,brains of humans?
5952.55,"Especially given that we have this speech,"
5954.9,although I do wonder sometimes
5956.3,if animals report in to each other there.
5958.98,Maybe they have little
psychiatric,sessions
5960.82,with one another.
5962.34,"- You know, I'm always"
careful,to not assume
5965.65,we do things better.
5967.03,We certainly understand what we're doing
5969.27,better than we understand
what,"animals are doing,"
5971.03,and they certainly do
things,better than we do.
5974.01,"That said, we do have"
"amazing,",wonderful brains
5976.85,and many structures that
are,very highly developed
5979.47,in our brains that are
not,nearly so developed
5982.35,in mice and fish for example.
5985.49,"Now, that said, when I"
look,"at the big picture,"
5990.029,what is the mammalian brain really doing?
5994.6,There are things that you
would,never have thought
5997.07,we could study in animals and
laboratory,"mammals like mice,"
6003.958,"that it turns out you can, actually,"
6005.79,and so I would never draw the line
6007.6,"and say, here's something"
you,"can't study in mice,"
6010.13,or here's something that
has,no parallel in mice.
6012.77,I would be very careful
6013.91,before making any statement like that.
6016.877,And a good example of that
is,we've been able to study
6019.09,"just in the past year,"
come,to an understanding
6020.94,"of dissociation, and we had a paper"
6024.56,"that came out in late 2020,"
both,"mouse and human work,"
6028.69,in which we got to the
sort,of the circuit basis
6032.44,for dissociation.
6034.14,"Now, what is dissociation?"
6035.59,A lot of people might
not,"have experienced it,"
6038.81,but it's actually very common.
6040.51,More than 70% of people
who've,been through trauma
6044.29,"experience dissociation,"
6045.85,it shows up in borderline
"personality,",it shows up in PTSD.
6049.73,"What it is, is a separation"
of,"the sense of self,"
6053.6,from the body.
6055.11,"So you can have someone who,"
it's,"not as if you're numb,"
6057.37,you're not anesthetized.
6058.54,You can still know that
something's,"happening to the body,"
6062.02,"but you just don't care,"
6063.3,"because you don't ascribe it to yourself,"
6066.02,"which is very interesting, right?"
6068.14,How interesting is that?
6069.11,- The cells report narrative.
6070.47,- Yeah. Yeah.
6071.71,"- In your book, you touch on this."
6073.61,"And I will say is the most precise,"
6077.11,and meaningful and eloquent description
6079.89,"of what might be consciousness,"
6081.78,this narrative toward
the,"self or of the self,"
6085.33,and where it might reside.
6086.43,"So in dissociative conditions,"
6089.52,people are feeling as kind
of,an absence of a merge
6092.8,between mind and body.
-,Right.
6094.23,- Is that one way to describe it?
6095.063,- That's right.
-,"And as I recall,"
6096.05,this paper involved an
exploration,of ketamine.
6099.35,- Ketamine was a big part of it.
6100.4,"Yeah, that's right."
6101.233,And so ketamine is
another,one of those cases
6103.05,where people can experience dissociation.
6105.7,"Ketamine or PCP, we call"
these,the dissociative drugs.
6108.92,They cause it just like these
other,psychiatric conditions
6112.88,can cause it.
6114.67,"But we were able to manifest this in mice,"
6119.37,administering these
dissociative,agents in mice.
6122.13,We could make them still
able,"to detect stimulus,"
6124.62,but not care that it was happening.
6127.18,All the while we were recording
6130.54,the activity of individual
cells,in the brain
6132.78,"to see what was going on,"
6134.716,what was happening along
with,"this dissociation,"
6138.12,and then use optogenetics
to,see that it mattered
6140.57,to actually provide
that,pattern of activity
6143.41,"and see, oh, that actually"
causes,the dissociation.
6146.62,"So we could do all that in mice,"
6148.93,which who would've thought
that,you could study something
6153.84,like this in mice?
6154.7,And we were able to go back
and,forth with human work
6158.38,because here in our Stanford
Comprehensive,"Epilepsy Center,"
6161.97,there's a lot of what we
call,Stereo EEG Recording.
6165.33,Patients who come in
6166.21,"and in the course of normal clinical care,"
6168.63,they have electrodes
recording,in their brain
6171.57,"to identify where the seizure is,"
6173.44,so they can be candidates
for,removing a little patch
6177.35,of the brain that's causing the seizure.
6178.73,This has done for patients who
medications,are not helping
6181.53,their seizure disorder.
6183.6,And there was a patient who
had,a dissociative state
6188.2,"before every seizure, so"
this,was a human being
6190.107,"who was really dissociating,"
6191.54,who could tell us literally
as,it was happening.
6193.67,And we could see this
"pattern,",the same pattern
6197.0,that was happening in the
"mice,",in the same patch
6199.43,"of the brain, we could see that happening"
6202.01,in the human being at
exactly,"the right time,"
6203.96,in the same patch of the
brain,that's homologous
6206.35,across these immense
evolutionary,distances.
6209.63,And we knew that it mattered
to,both the mouse and human
6212.01,because in the human we
could,cause it to happen.
6214.796,- I just want to underscore the power
6219.554,of optogenetics and the ability
6222.0,to not just remove a particular
experience,or behavior
6226.01,"by lesioning or destroying,"
but,then to go back
6228.95,and actually activate same
structure,or group of structures
6232.75,and see the emergences.
6234.14,"So essentially, these days you hear a lot"
6236.65,about gain of function research
6237.96,"in the context of viral manipulation,"
6239.59,but gain of function is something
6240.473,that we do in the laboratory
6241.99,"and you do in patients, to"
both,take away something
6246.23,"and put it back, which"
gives,you causality.
6249.16,- That's right.
6249.993,"Yeah, and exactly."
6251.132,"And so with optogenetics,"
we,were able to provide
6254.21,in animals without being
on,any ketamine or any drug
6258.15,and we could cause the dissociative state
6259.66,by playing in a precise
pattern,of activity.
6261.9,And who would have
thought,you could do that?
6263.71,But that was a combined
mouse,and human paper.
6266.92,"Likewise, we've been able"
to,play in visual sensations
6272.2,"into the brains of mice,"
and,by observing which cells
6278.31,in the visual part of
the,"brain, visual cortex,"
6280.7,are naturally responsive to
for,"example, vertical bars,"
6284.61,instead of horizontal
bars,"in the visual world,"
6287.71,we could see which cells
were,normally reporting
6290.03,"on vertical bars, and then"
we,could use optogenetics
6292.63,to come and play in activity
just,to those cells.
6296.34,- So these animals are
not,viewing anything?
6298.19,- Not viewing anything at all.
6299.38,And we could activate just
the,"vertical bar cells,"
6302.53,and not only did the animal act
6304.16,"as if it was seeing a vertical bar,"
6305.84,"behaviorally, it was trained"
to,do a particular thing
6307.81,"if it saw a vertical bar, and it did that,"
6309.73,just as if it was seeing
something,visually.
6312.69,But everything in the brain
that,we were recording
6314.42,to the internal representation
of,this external world
6318.61,was naturalistic too.
6319.88,It looked like the brain
was,seeing something visual.
6323.16,"So that's gain of function too, you know,"
6326.24,"playing in, providing a"
complex,sensation or percept
6330.2,that wasn't there before.
6331.51,And we can do that across species.
6334.51,"So, and of course mice are social,"
6338.17,and they do amazing acts
of,information processing
6344.101,and I try not to disparage
our,cousins too much.
6346.8,- They certainly have helped
the,field of neuroscience
6348.64,"and medicine I should mention,"
6350.08,and I know that people
have,various sensitivities
6351.89,"about animal research, but the"
work,that's been carried out
6355.21,in mice has been absolutely
vital,and instructional
6359.897,for treatment of human disease.
6362.802,- That's right.
6364.04,- Since we talked about
dissociation,and dissociative states
6369.02,"rather and ketamine,"
I'd,love your thoughts
6371.57,on psychedelic medicine.
6374.95,"You know, I sort of half joke"
having,grown up in this area
6379.03,in Northern California when it
was,much more counter-culture
6381.25,"than it is now, that many of the things"
6384.62,"that we're hearing about now,"
6387.87,at least from my read
of,"the history books,"
6390.55,happened before.
6391.71,There was a movement
6393.61,aimed at taking the very
same,"compounds essentially,"
6396.82,putting them into patients
6397.91,or people who were obviously
using,"them recreationally,"
6401.13,"but putting them into patients,"
6402.75,"and seeing tremendous positive effects,"
6404.94,but also tremendous examples
of,induced psychiatric illness.
6410.68,"In other words, many"
people,lost their minds
6412.47,as a consequence of
overuse,of psychedelics.
6414.77,"I'll probably lose a few people out there,"
6419.16,but I do want to talk
"about,",what is the state
6423.18,of these compounds?
6424.34,And I realize it's a huge
category,"of compounds,"
6426.45,"but LSD and psilocybin, as I"
understand,trigger activation
6429.84,of particular serotonin
receptor,"mechanisms,"
6432.41,may or may not lead to
more,widespread activation
6435.3,of the brain that one
wouldn't,see otherwise.
6438.35,But when you look at the clinical
6439.67,"and experimental literature,"
6441.56,what is your sort of top contour sense
6443.91,of how effective these
tools,are going to be
6446.17,for treating depression?
6447.72,"And then if we have the time,"
we,could talk about trauma
6450.37,and MDMA and some of that work.
6452.67,"- Well, you're right to"
highlight,both the opportunity
6457.601,and the parallel that is there.
6459.84,And of course we want to help patients
6461.81,and of course we want to explore anything
6465.31,"that might be helpful,"
6467.39,but we want to do it in
a,safe and rigorous way.
6470.47,But I do think we should
explore,these avenues.
6473.59,These are agents that alter reality
6477.17,and alter the experience
of,"reality I should say,"
6480.436,in relatively precise ways.
6482.523,"They do have problems,"
they,"can be addictive,"
6485.21,they can cause lasting
change,"that is not desirable,"
6489.948,but we have to see these as opportunities.
6492.38,"We have to first of all,"
study,"in the laboratory,"
6495.55,and I'm doing this here.
6497.52,You know we have [chuckles] big...
6500.32,We have safes with many
interesting,psychedelics
6503.05,that are all very carefully regulated.
6504.83,We get inspections from the DEA and so on.
6507.29,"- If anyone's hoping to find these labs,"
6508.512,[Karl laughing]
they,"exist in outer space,"
6509.81,so you need to be on board
one,of the SpaceX missions
6514.28,in order to access them.
6515.113,So don't try and come find them.
6516.17,"- No, that's exactly true. Yes."
6520.438,And we're doing exactly this.
6522.33,We're saying this is an
incredible,opportunity.
6523.84,If we could understand how
6526.628,"the perception of reality is altered,"
6529.13,we could be creating new
kinds,of intervention
6532.08,that don't have the risks
6534.67,and the problems of causing
lasting,change or addiction.
6540.25,"Now, that said, even as"
these,"medications exist now,"
6546.22,"as you know, there's"
an,impulse to use them
6549.26,in very small doses and to use
them,as adjunctive treatments
6552.76,for the therapy of various kinds.
6555.16,And I'm also supportive
of,that if done carefully
6558.41,"and rigorously, of course there's risk,"
6560.87,but there's risk with many
other,kinds of treatments.
6563.93,And I'm not sure that the
risks,for these medications
6569.19,vastly outweigh the risks
that,we normally tolerate
6571.42,in other branches of medicine.
6572.86,- Why would they work?
6574.41,"I mean, let's say that"
indeed,their main effect
6581.03,"is to create more connectivity,"
6584.76,at least in the moment
between,brain areas.
6588.27,So the way I think about the two extremes
6592.216,"of my experience anyways,"
6593.87,a high degree of stress and
focus,"for whatever reason,"
6597.36,is going to create
changes,in my visual field
6599.82,and changes in the way
that,"I perceive times,"
6602.24,"so that I'm on a micro-sliced time,"
6603.94,I might be in a very contracted view
6605.77,"of whatever my experience is,"
6607.35,whereas on the opposite
extreme,"in a dream or in sleep,"
6611.62,"space and time are very fluid,"
6613.47,"and I'm essentially relaxed,"
6615.21,although it might be a
very,"interesting dream,"
6617.02,or it might not be.
6618.63,Psychedelics seemed to be a trajectory.
6621.69,I'm not too far off from the dream state
6625.39,where space and time are
essentially,not as rigid.
6629.92,"And there is this element of synesthesia,"
6632.27,"blending of the senses, you know,"
6634.66,feeling colors and hearing
light,and things of that sort.
6640.66,"You hear these reports, anyway."
6643.52,Why would having that
dream-like,experience
6648.0,"somehow relieve depression, long-term?"
6651.62,Do we have any idea why that might be?
6654.17,- Yeah.
6656.15,"We have some ideas, and"
no,deep understanding.
6659.52,One way I think about the psychedelics
6662.13,is they increase our willingness to...
6667.3,They increase the willingness of our brain
6668.89,to accept unlikely ways
of,"constructing the world,"
6673.38,"unlikely hypothesis, as it"
"were,",as to what's going on.
6676.45,"The brain, in particular"
our,"cortex, I think,"
6678.67,is a hypothesis generation
and,testing machine.
6681.86,It's coming up with
models,about everything.
6683.87,"It's got a lot of bits of data coming in,"
6686.92,and it's making models
and,updating the models
6689.45,"and changing them, theories,"
hypothesis,for what's going on.
6693.57,And some of those never
reach,our conscious mind.
6696.05,And this is something I
talk,"about in ""Projections"""
6698.37,"in the book quite a bit, is"
many,of these are filtered out
6702.34,before they get to our
conscious,"mind, and that's good."
6706.26,Think how distracted we'd be
6707.46,if we were constantly
having,to evaluate all these
6710.19,hypotheses about what
kinds,of shapes or objects
6712.98,or processes were out there.
6714.86,And so a lot of this is handled
6717.37,before it gets to consciousness.
6719.07,"What the psychedelics seem to do,"
6720.8,is they change the threshold
for,us to become aware
6726.39,of these incomplete hypotheses
or,"wrong hypotheses,"
6729.56,or concepts that might be
noise,"but are just wrong,"
6734.18,and so are never allowed to
get,into our conscious mind.
6737.95,"Now, that's pretty interesting,"
6740.96,and it goes wrong in
psychiatric,disorders.
6743.3,I think in schizophrenia
there's,some of the times
6746.43,the paranoid delusions that people have
6749.43,are examples of these poor models
6753.31,that escape into the conscious mind
6755.15,and become accepted as reality
6757.44,and they never should've gotten out there.
6760.38,"Now, how could something"
like,"this in the right way,"
6763.21,help with something like depression?
6765.41,Patients with depression often are stuck.
6770.0,They can't look into the
future,world of possibilities
6777.58,as effectively.
6779.78,Everything seems hopeless.
6783.65,And what does that really mean?
6785.313,They discount the value
of,"their own action,"
6788.35,they discount the value of the world
6790.81,at giving rise to a future that matters.
6793.35,Everything seems to run out like a river
6795.51,just running out into
a,"desert and drying up,"
6800.09,and what these agents may do
6802.44,that increase the flow through
"circuitry,","if you will,"
6805.51,the percolation of
activity,through circuitry
6807.48,may end up doing for depression
6809.34,is increasing the escape of some tendrils
6812.906,of process of forward
progression,through the world.
6818.93,"That's a concept, that's"
how,I think about it.
6821.69,There are ways we can make that rigorous.
6823.482,We can indeed identify in
the,"brain by recording,"
6827.12,we can see cells that
represent,steps along a path
6830.8,"and look into the future,"
6834.2,and we can rigorously define these cells
6836.56,and we can see if these are
altered,on psychedelics.
6839.31,And so that's one of the reasons
6840.54,that we're working with these
agents,in the laboratory
6844.08,"to say, all right, is"
this,really the case?
6845.92,Are these opening up new paths
6848.419,or representations of
paths,into the future?
6853.82,"- MDMA, ecstasy is a unique compound"
6857.46,in that it leads to big increases
6859.92,in brain levels of dopamine
and,serotonin simultaneously.
6864.72,And I realized that the neuromodulators
6866.77,like dopamine and serotonin
often,"work in concert,"
6869.38,"not alone, the way"
they're,commonly described
6871.63,in the more general popular discussions.
6875.49,"However, it is a unique compound,"
6878.92,and it's different than
the,"serotonergic compounds,"
6881.1,like LSD and psilocybin.
6883.47,"And there are now data,"
6887.35,"still emerging that it might be,"
6889.78,and in some cases can be useful
for,"the treatment of trauma,"
6894.08,PTSD and similar things.
6897.896,Why would that work?
6899.202,"And a larger question, perhaps"
the,more important question
6903.33,"is, psychedelics, MDMA,"
"LSD,","all those compounds,"
6907.823,in my mind there are two components.
6910.14,There's the experience you
have,"while you're on them,"
6912.82,and then there's the
effect,they have after.
6916.37,People are generating
variations,of these compounds
6918.92,that are non-hallucinatory variations.
6922.02,"But, how crucial do you think it is"
6924.7,"to have, let's stay with MDMA,"
6926.99,"the experience of huge levels of dopamine,"
6931.53,"huge levels of serotonin,"
6933.5,atypical levels of dopamine
and,"serotonin released,"
6935.81,having this highly abnormal experience
6938.03,in order to be normal again?
6939.67,- Yeah.
6940.89,I think the brain learns
from,those experiences.
6943.102,That's the way I see
"it,","and so for example,"
6946.04,"people who have taken MDMA,"
6949.24,"as you say, there will be the acute phase"
6951.72,of being on the drug
6954.32,and experiencing this
extreme,connectedness
6957.74,"with other people for example,"
6959.45,"and then the drug wears off,"
6964.07,but the brain learned
from,that experience.
6966.16,"And so what people will report is,"
6969.25,"yeah, I'm not in that state,"
but,I saw what was possible.
6972.68,I saw it. Yeah.
6975.74,"There don't need to be barriers,"
6977.52,or at least not as many
barriers,as I thought.
6979.81,I can connect with more people
6982.929,in a way that that is helpful.
6984.01,And so I think it's the learning
that,"happens in that state,"
6987.86,that actually matters.
6989.55,"- And as you described that,"
6990.87,that sounds a lot like what I understand
6992.55,to be the hallmark feature of
really,"good psychoanalysis,"
6995.31,that the relationship between
patient,"and therapist,"
6998.65,hopefully evolves to the point
7000.21,where these kinds of tests can be run
7003.86,"within the context of that relationship,"
7005.86,and then exported to other relations.
7008.21,- Exactly right. Yeah.
7009.25,"- And that probably, I'm assuming"
7011.33,is still the goal of really
good,psychiatry also.
7013.88,- As a part of-
7015.19,"- Intimacy, really."
7016.73,- It should be.
7018.26,"When we have time, I think"
all,good psychiatrists
7021.7,try to achieve that level
of,"connection and learning,"
7025.65,try to help patients create
a,"new model that is stable,"
7031.31,"that is learned, and that can"
help,instruct future behavior.
7036.19,- One of the things that I
took,"from reading your book,"
7039.64,in addition to learning so much science
7042.17,and the future of psychiatry
and,"brain science was,"
7048.92,"amidst this very tragic cases and sadness,"
7051.56,and a lot of the weight that
that,"puts on the clinician,"
7055.24,"on you also, that there's"
a,"central cord of optimism,"
7061.64,that where we're headed
is,not just possible
7065.89,"but very likely, and better."
7068.4,- Yeah.
7071.731,"- And, are you an optimist?"
7072.84,- [chuckles] I am.
7073.82,"And by the way, this was a"
really,interesting experience
7076.61,"in writing ""Projections"","
because,I had a dual goal.
7080.87,"I wanted it to be for everybody,"
7082.77,literally everybody in the
world,who wants to read it.
7088.43,"And yet at the same time,"
7089.93,I wanted to stay absolutely
rigorously,"close to the science,"
7096.63,"what was actually known, when"
I,was speaking about science.
7100.75,When I was speaking about
the,neurobiology of the brain
7104.29,"or psychiatry, I wanted to not have"
7108.23,any of my scientific colleagues
7110.13,"think, oh, he's going too"
"far,",he's saying too much.
7112.787,And so I had these two goals
7114.96,which I kept on my mind the entire time.
7117.11,And a lot of this trying to
find,exactly the right word
7119.72,"we talked about was, on this path"
7122.08,of staying excruciatingly
rigorous,in the science
7125.22,"and yet, letting people see the hope,"
7128.51,"where things were, have everybody see"
7130.773,"that we've come a long way,"
we,"have a long way to go,"
7134.22,but the trajectory and
the,path is beautiful.
7138.41,"And so that was the goal, I think."
7144.383,Of course that sounds almost impossible
7147.103,[chuckles] to jointly
satisfy,"those two goals,"
7150.65,but I kept that in my mind
the,whole way through.
7152.95,"And yes, I am optimistic"
7154.55,and I hope that it came
through,in the book
7156.56,"- It certainly did, and at"
least,"from this colleague,"
7160.474,you did achieve both.
7162.72,"And it's a wonderful, it's"
a,"masterful book, really,"
7166.51,and one that as a scientist
7168.38,and somebody who is a
fellow,"brain explorer,"
7172.61,hits all the marks of rigor
and,is incredibly interesting
7176.5,and there's a ton of storytelling.
7177.87,I don't want to give
away,"too much about it,"
7179.31,but people should definitely
check,out the book.
7182.67,Are you active on social media?
7184.24,If people want to follow you
7185.84,and connect with what you're
doing,now and going forward?
7188.69,- Yeah. I have Twitter.
7190.08,"That's where I mainly do exchange,"
7194.23,tell people about things
that,are happening.
7196.35,"- We'll provide a link to it,"
but,"that's Karl Deisseroth,"
7198.26,"as I recall, with a K?"
7199.31,- That's right.
7200.143,- Yeah.
-,That's right.
7200.976,"- And so you're on Twitter,"
7202.39,"and people will hear this,"
definitely,check out the book.
7207.62,There are other people in our community
7209.1,that of course are going to be
reaching,"out on your behalf,"
7213.24,but it's incredible that you juggle
7215.92,"this enormous number of things,"
7219.14,"perhaps even more important however,"
7222.1,is that it's all in service
to,this larger thing
7224.85,of relieving suffering.
7225.89,"So thank you so much for your time today,"
7228.36,"for the book, and the"
work,that [chuckles] went
7230.09,"into the book, I can't even imagine,"
7231.744,[Karl laughs]
for,the laboratory work
7232.577,and the development of
"channelopsins,","clarity,"
7234.5,and all the related technologies
7235.77,and for the clinical work you're doing
7237.76,and for sharing with us.
7239.09,"- Well, thank you for all"
you're,doing in reaching out.
7242.58,I'm very impressed by it.
7243.77,"It's important and it's so valuable,"
7246.28,and thank you for taking the time
7247.56,and for all your gracious
words,about the book.
7249.93,Thank you.
7251.4,- I hope you enjoyed today's
discussion,with Dr. Deisseroth
7253.86,as much as I did.
