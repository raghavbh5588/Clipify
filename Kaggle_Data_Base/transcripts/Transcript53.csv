0.15,[upbeat music] - Welcome to 
0.983,the Huberman Lab Podcast 
1.92,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.93,for everyday life. 
9.13,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.09,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
12.64,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.56,"Today, we are going to discuss the gut and the brain, "
17.89,and we are going to discuss how your gut 
20.08,influences your brain and your brain influences your gut. 
24.2,"As many of you probably know, "
25.9,"there is a phenomenon called your gut feeling, "
28.69,which tends to be something that you seem to know 
31.49,without really knowing how you know it. 
33.96,That's one version of the gut feeling. 
35.95,"The other is that you sense something in your actual gut, "
39.85,"in your body, and that somehow drives you "
43.7,"to think or feel or act in a particular way, "
46.55,maybe to move towards something 
48.16,or to move away from something. 
50.32,"Now, today, we aren't going to focus so much "
52.23,on the psychology of gut feelings 
54.9,but on the biology of gut feelings 
57.33,and how the gut and brain interact. 
59.14,Because indeed your gut is communicating to your brain 
61.63,"both directly by way of neurons, nerve cells, "
65.13,"and indirectly by changing the chemistry of your body, "
68.38,which permeates up to your brain 
70.02,and impacts various aspects of brain function. 
72.98,"But it works in the other direction, too. "
74.86,Your brain is influencing your entire gut. 
78.04,"And when I say entire gut, I don't just mean your stomach, "
80.34,"I mean, your entire digestive tract. "
82.47,Your brain is impacting things 
83.78,"like how quickly your food is digesting, "
86.32,"the chemistry of your gut, "
88.06,if you happen to be stressed or not stressed. 
90.41,Whether or not you are under a particular social challenge 
93.68,or whether or not you're particularly happy 
95.31,will in fact adjust the chemistry of your gut 
98.07,and the chemistry of your gut in turn 
100.33,will change the way that your brain works. 
102.78,I'll put all that together for you 
104.27,in the context of what we call the gut microbiome. 
107.23,The gut microbiome are the trillions of little bacteria 
110.87,that live all the way along your digestive tract 
114.1,and that strongly impact the way that your entire body works 
117.84,"at the level of metabolism, "
119.17,"immune system, and brain function. "
121.76,"And of course, we will discuss to tools, "
123.73,things that you can do in order to maintain 
126.45,or improve your gut health. 
128.49,"Because as you'll also soon see, "
130.7,gut health is immensely important 
133.11,for all aspects of our wellbeing 
135.61,"at the level of our brain, "
136.94,"at the level of our body, "
138.55,"And there are simple, actionable things that we can all do "
141.27,in order to optimize our gut health 
143.78,in ways that optimize 
144.97,our overall nervous system functioning. 
146.98,So we will be sure to review those today. 
149.83,This episode also serves as a bit of a primer 
152.37,for our guest episode that's coming up next week 
155.02,with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg from Stanford University. 
158.34,Dr. Sonnenburg is a world expert in the gut microbiome 
162.46,and so we will dive really deep into the gut microbiome 
165.84,in all its complexity. 
167.53,We'll make it all very simple for you. 
169.02,We will also talk about actionable tools in that episode. 
171.78,"This episode is a standalone episode, "
173.78,"so you'll get a lot of information and tools, "
175.86,"but if you have the opportunity to see this episode first, "
178.37,I think it will serve as a nice primer for the conversation 
181.44,with Dr. Sonnenburg. 
182.89,"Before we begin, "
183.8,I'd like to emphasize that this podcast 
185.48,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
188.25,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
190.3,to bring zero cost to consumer information 
192.2,about science and science-related tools 
194.36,to the general public. 
195.78,"In keeping with that theme, "
196.88,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
199.77,Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. 
202.0,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one 
203.61,vitamin mineral probiotic drink. 
206.08,"I've been using Athletic Greens, "
207.52,which is now called AG
"1,",since 
2012,
210.86,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
213.5,The reason I started taking Athletic Greens 
215.3,and the reason I still take Athletic Greens 
216.86,once or twice a day 
218.13,is that it covers 
218.963,all of my foundational vitamin and mineral needs 
221.3,and also because it contains 
223.33,"high quality probiotics and prebiotics, "
226.0,which is a topic that we're going to talk a lot about today. 
228.72,"With Athletic Greens, I can be sure that I'm getting "
230.9,all the vitamins and minerals that I need. 
232.93,"So if I'm missing anything in my diet, "
235.03,I can compensate for that with the Athletic Greens. 
237.55,Plus it has the probiotics and prebiotics 
240.36,that can also compensate for any deficiencies 
242.55,that I might have in creating the right environment 
245.5,for my gut microbiome. 
247.08,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
248.44,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
251.38,to claim a special offer. 
252.73,"They'll give you five free travel packs, "
254.27,which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
256.75,while you're in the car or on a plane 
258.23,"or otherwise on the move, "
259.32,and they'll give year's supply of vitamin D
3,K
2.,
262.73,While not everyone needs additional vitamin D
"3,",
265.26,many people do even if they're getting sufficient sunlight. 
268.23,So you get the year's supply of vitamin D
"3,",
269.88,and it also has K
2,in there. 
271.1,K
2,has been shown to be important 
273.13,"for various aspects of calcium regulation, "
275.3,"cardiovascular health, and so on. "
277.06,"Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman "
279.74,to claim this special offer. 
281.24,Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. 
284.25,LMNT is an electrolyte drink that contains no sugar. 
287.23,"It does however contain sodium, magnesium, and potassium. "
291.23,I've talked about sodium on the podcast before. 
294.05,I think sodium can indeed be problematic for some people 
297.78,"with hypertension or pre-hypertension, "
299.95,"but for many people, sodium is a great thing. "
303.05,It can increase blood volume 
304.19,in ways that can be helpful to them. 
305.74,It can improve nerve cell function in ways 
307.96,"that can be helpful to them, "
309.18,"and for me, anytime I'm exercising and sweating a lot, "
312.62,I want to replace my electrolytes 
314.03,and that means replacing sodium 
315.51,"for adequate neuron function, muscle function, and so on. "
319.023,LMNT is formulated to help anyone 
320.75,with their electrolyte needs 
322.09,and is perfectly suited for people 
323.63,"who are following a ketogenic, low carbohydrate, "
326.23,or paleo diet. 
327.88,LMNT contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio 
330.36,of 
1000,"milligrams of sodium, "
332.7,
200,"milligrams of potassium, "
334.17,and 
60,milligrams of magnesium. 
336.47,"If you'd like to try LMNT, "
337.417,you can go to drinklmnt.com/huberman 
340.72,to claim a free LMNT sample pack. 
342.66,You only pay the cost of shipping. 
344.32,"Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman "
347.32,to claim a free sample pack. 
349.0,Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
351.62,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
354.34,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
356.95,to help you better understand your body 
358.55,and help you reach your health goals. 
360.58,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
363.51,for the simple reason that many of the things that impact 
366.16,your immediate and long-term health can only be assessed 
368.96,with a quality blood test. 
370.33,"And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests, "
373.2,"you can also get insights into, for instance, "
375.46,what your biological age is and how that compares 
378.41,to your chronological age. 
380.25,"Now, one of the major problems with a lot of blood tests "
382.61,"and DNA tests out there is that you get numbers back, "
385.32,they'll tell you if those numbers are in range 
386.85,and out of range 
387.84,but they don't tell you anything about what to do 
389.36,with that information. 
390.673,"With InsideTracker, they make everything very simple "
393.33,in terms of directing you towards particular protocols. 
395.82,"So these could be nutrition protocols, "
397.77,"supplementation protocols, or lifestyle behavioral protocols "
401.29,to help you bring those numbers 
402.76,into the ranges that are best for you. 
405.28,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "
406.69,you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman 
409.27,to get 
20%,off any of InsideTracker's plans. 
412.11,That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 
20%,off. 
416.01,"Okay, let's talk about the gut and the brain "
418.4,and how your gut and your brain 
419.77,communicate in both directions. 
422.16,"Because as I mentioned before, "
423.64,your gut is communicating all the time 
426.23,with your brain and your brain is communicating all the time 
429.49,with your gut. 
430.4,"And so the two are in this ongoing dance with one another, "
434.08,that ordinarily is below your conscious detection 
437.23,although you're probably familiar with the experience 
439.37,of every once in a while getting a stomach ache 
441.74,"or of eating something that doesn't agree with you, "
443.8,or conversely eating something 
445.47,that you find particularly delicious 
447.87,and that sensation or that experience rather 
450.83,being a whole body experience. 
452.8,"Your mind is excited about what you're eating or just ate, "
455.77,"your gut is excited about what you're eating or just ate, "
459.2,and it seems to be a kind of unified perception 
462.07,of both brain and body. 
464.13,"Today, we're going to talk about how that comes about "
466.31,in the negative sense. 
467.69,"Like, you know, when you meet someone you really dislike "
470.55,"or when you have a stomach ache, "
471.44,"and in the positive sense, "
472.91,when you interact with somebody 
473.85,"that you really, really like "
474.98,"and you'd like to spend more time with them, for instance, "
477.18,or when you eat something 
478.47,"that you really, really like "
479.93,"and you'd like to spend more time with that food, "
481.85,so to speak. 
483.1,"Now, the gut and the brain represent what we call "
486.15,"a biological circuit, "
488.23,meaning they include different stations. 
490.91,"So station A communicates with station B, "
493.64,"which communicates with station C, and so on. "
496.22,"And as I mentioned earlier, it is bidirectional. "
497.92,It's a two-way street between gut and brain. 
501.29,I want to make the important point at the outset 
504.04,"that when I say the word gut, "
505.97,"when I refer to the gut, "
507.45,I am not just referring to the stomach. 
510.52,Most of us think that the gut equates to the stomach 
513.76,because we think of having a gut or not having a gut 
517.0,or having a gut feeling of some sort. 
519.79,But in the context of gut-brain signaling 
523.25,"and the related microbiome, "
525.81,the gut includes the entire digestive tract. 
529.54,"That's right, from start to finish "
531.3,the entire digestive tract 
533.08,"so much so that today we're going to talk about, "
535.77,"for instance, the presence of neurons, nerve cells, "
538.84,that reside in your gut 
540.45,that communicate to specific locations in the brain 
543.67,"and cause the release of specific neurochemicals, "
546.25,"such as the neurochemical dopamine or serotonin, "
549.52,that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food 
552.81,"or type of interaction or behavior, "
555.01,"or to avoid particular foods, interactions, and behaviors. "
558.56,"And some of those neurons, many of those neurons, in fact, "
561.62,"reside in your intestines, not in your stomach. "
564.71,They can be in the small intestine or the large intestine. 
567.58,"In fact, you actually have taste receptors and neurons "
571.16,located all along your digestive tract. 
573.82,You have neurons that are located 
575.26,all along your digestive tract 
576.81,and they are communicating to your brain 
579.45,"to impact what you think, what you feel, and what you do. "
582.83,"Okay, so for the gut-brain axis, "
584.34,we need to deal with the brain part 
585.94,and then we need to deal with the gut part. 
588.08,Let's just quickly talk about the brain part 
589.87,because there the word brain is also a bit of a misnomer 
593.61,"in that when we say the gut-brain axis, "
595.94,it does include the brain 
597.22,but includes a lot of other things as well. 
600.31,"So as many of you probably know by now, "
602.7,"if you're listeners of this podcast, "
604.16,"and if you don't, that's fine, "
606.08,your nervous system includes your brain 
609.14,and your spinal cord 
610.39,and those together constitute 
611.69,what's called the central nervous system. 
614.28,"Your neural retinas, "
615.64,which are lining the back of your eyes 
618.49,and are the light sensing portion of your eyes 
622.39,are also part of your central nervous system. 
625.72,So actually your eyes are part of your brain. 
627.323,They're the only parts of your brain 
628.97,that are outside the cranial vault. 
631.01,"So your retinas, your brain proper, "
634.08,and your spinal cord make up the central nervous system. 
636.62,The other parts of your nervous system constitute 
638.44,"what's called the peripheral nervous system, "
640.99,which are the components of your nervous system 
642.69,"that reside outside the retinas, brain, and spinal cord. "
646.65,"Now, this is very important "
647.76,because today we're going to talk a lot 
649.38,about how the gut communicates with the brain. 
652.14,And it does that by way 
653.73,"of peripheral nervous system components, "
657.02,meaning nerve cells that reside in the gut 
659.5,and elsewhere in the body that communicate to the brain 
663.26,and cross into the central nervous system 
665.96,"to influence what you think and what you feel, okay? "
668.81,So that's the nervous system part of what we call 
671.32,"the gut-brain axis, "
673.4,"brain, again, just being a shorthand "
674.87,for including all the elements I just described. 
677.85,"Gut, as you now know, "
679.07,includes all the elements of the digestive tract. 
681.56,Let's talk about the architecture or the structure 
684.85,of the gut of your digestive system. 
687.56,"Now, not surprisingly your digestive system, "
690.44,"aka your gut, begins at your mouth and ends at your anus. "
694.15,"And all along its length, "
695.78,there are a series of sphincters 
698.0,that cut off certain chambers of the digestive tract 
701.34,from the other chambers. 
703.5,"Now, also along this tube that we call the digestive tract, "
707.95,"there's great variation in the degree of acidity, "
711.23,or pH as it's sometimes called. 
714.29,That variation in acidity turns out to give rise 
718.0,to different little microenvironments 
720.6,"in which particular microbiota, microbacteria, "
724.32,can thrive or fail to thrive. 
727.66,And so the way I'd like you to think 
729.01,"about the digestive tract, "
730.33,"this gut component of the gut-brain axis, "
733.42,is that it's not just one component. 
735.66,It's not just your stomach with a particular acidity 
738.47,and a bunch of microorganisms 
740.36,that work particularly well 
742.44,to make you feel good 
743.59,and make your digestive pathways work well. 
747.11,"It's a series of chambers, little microenvironments, "
750.38,in which particular microbiota thrive 
753.32,and other microbiota do not. 
755.82,And certain behaviors that you undertake 
758.64,and certain experiences that you have 
760.65,will adjust those microenvironments in ways 
763.63,"that make particular microbiota, certain bacteria, "
766.64,more likely to thrive and others less likely to thrive. 
770.05,We'll talk about how that was set up for you early in life. 
773.23,"Actually from the moment that you came into the world, "
775.37,that microbiome was being established. 
777.73,It was actually strongly impacted 
780.72,depending on whether or not you were born by C-section 
782.88,or by vaginal birth. 
785.0,And it was strongly impacted by who handled you 
787.95,"when you came into the world, "
788.9,literally the hands that were on you. 
790.83,"How much skin contact you had, "
792.6,"whether or not you were a preemie baby or not, "
794.89,"whether or not you had pets at home, "
796.21,"whether or not you were allowed to play in the dirt, "
797.86,whether or not you were allowed to eat snails 
799.28,or whether or not you were kept 
800.51,in a very antiseptic environment. 
802.42,All of those experiences 
803.81,shaped these little microenvironments 
806.22,and shaped what constitutes best or worst 
809.03,"for those microenvironments, okay? "
810.91,So you have this long tube that we call the digestive tract 
814.28,"and it's very, very long. "
816.4,"In fact, if we were to splay it out, "
818.63,we were to take all the curves and turns 
820.88,"out of the intestine, we would find that it is very long. "
823.94,It's approximately nine meters long. 
826.94,"Now, the structure of that digestive tract "
828.71,turns out to be very important 
830.3,in terms of gut-brain signaling. 
833.61,"Once again, it's a tube and the hollow of that tube "
836.11,"is called the lumen, L-U-M-E-N. "
839.22,"But the walls of the tube are not necessarily smooth, "
842.47,at least not for significant portions 
844.48,of the digestive tract. 
846.14,"For much of the digestive tract, "
849.04,there are bumps and grooves that look very much 
851.83,"like the folds in the brain, "
853.15,but these bumps and grooves are made up of other tissues. 
856.01,"They're made up of what's called a mucosal lining, "
857.98,so there's a lot of mucus there. 
860.12,"And if we were to look really closely, "
862.4,what we'd find is that there are 
863.6,little hairy-like cellular processes 
867.17,that we call microvilli 
869.07,that are able to push things along the digestive tract. 
874.31,The microbiota reside everywhere along the lumen 
878.15,"of the digestive tract, "
880.35,starting at the mouth and all the way to the other end. 
883.04,And they reside within those microvilli 
885.87,and they reside within the lumen. 
888.13,And if we were to look really closely 
891.14,"at the bumps and grooves along the digestive tract, "
894.33,"what we would find is that there are little niches, "
897.0,little areas in which particular things 
899.91,can grow and reside best. 
902.44,"Now, that might sound kind of gross, "
903.68,"but it actually is a good thing, "
905.37,especially what's growing and residing there 
908.08,are microbacterial organisms that are good for your gut 
912.53,and that signal good things to your brain. 
914.3,And we will talk about what that signaling looks like 
916.44,and how that's done and accomplished in just a few moments. 
919.25,"But I want you to get a clear mental picture of your gut, "
922.32,something that we don't often see. 
923.99,"And often when we think about the gut, "
925.58,"again, we just think about the hollow of the stomach, "
927.81,"food going in there, and getting digested, "
929.82,but it's far more complex 
931.15,and actually far more interesting than that. 
933.17,"Now, I've been referring to the gut microbiome "
935.38,and to the microbiota and these bacteria. 
938.32,Let me define those terms a little bit more specifically 
940.82,just to avoid any confusion. 
943.97,The microbiota are the actual bacteria. 
946.94,The microbiome is used to refer to the bacteria 
950.17,"but also all the genes as bacteria make, "
952.83,because it turns out that they make some important genes 
954.71,that actually impact all of us. 
958.46,You have loads and loads 
960.24,"of these little microbiota, these bacteria. "
963.41,"In fact, right now you are carrying with you "
966.06,"about two to three kilograms, "
968.22,"so that's more than six pounds, "
970.34,"of these microbiota, these bacteria. "
973.1,"And if we were to look at them under a microscope, "
974.9,what we would see 
975.733,is these are relatively simple little organisms. 
978.51,Some remain stationary so they might plop down 
981.47,into the mucosal lining 
982.94,or they might hang out on a particular microvilli 
985.45,"or they might be in one of those little niches, "
988.17,"and others can move about, "
990.15,but they basically fill the entire lumen. 
993.01,They surround and kind of coat the surface 
996.04,of the microvilli and they're tucked up 
998.57,into any of those little niches that are available to them 
1002.21,to tuck into. 
1004.3,If you were to take the head of a pin 
1006.85,"and look at it under the microscope, "
1009.21,"you could fit many, many hundreds, "
1010.95,if not thousands or more of these little microbacteria. 
1015.51,"And the reason I say many, many thousands or more, "
1018.45,"I'm giving a kind of broad range there, "
1020.29,is that they do vary in size 
1022.13,"and, again, they vary as to whether or not they can move "
1023.87,or they don't move. 
1025.62,"Now, they're constantly turning over in your gut, "
1028.07,meaning they're being born so to speak 
1030.52,and they're dying off. 
1032.67,And some will stay there 
1034.41,for very long periods of time within your gut 
1036.33,and others will get excreted. 
1038.13,About 
60%,"of your stool, "
1040.95,"as unpleasant as that might be to think about, "
1043.52,is made up of live and dead microbacteria. 
1047.73,So you're constantly making 
1049.22,and excreting these microbacteria. 
1052.25,And which microbacteria you make 
1055.34,"and how many stay inside your gut and how many leave, "
1059.7,"meaning how many are excreted, "
1062.23,depends a lot on the chemistry of your gut 
1065.33,and depends very strongly on the foods that you eat 
1068.76,and the foods that you do not eat. 
1070.94,"Now, just because what we eat strongly influences "
1073.48,"our microbiome, meaning our microbacteria, "
1076.97,does not mean that there are not other influences 
1080.51,on what constitutes our microbiome. 
1083.93,Our microbiome is also made up by microbacteria 
1087.48,"that access our digestive tract through our mouth, "
1090.02,"through breathing, through kissing, "
1093.83,and through skin contact. 
1096.12,"In fact, one of the major determinants of our microbiome "
1099.7,is who we interact with 
1101.67,and the environment that we happen to be in. 
1104.06,And that actually includes whether or not 
1105.57,we interact with animals. 
1107.85,"In a little bit, I'll talk about some data "
1110.2,"as to whether or not you grew up in a home that had animals, "
1113.35,"whether or not you grew up in the home, "
1114.52,"whether or not there was a lot of social contact, "
1116.41,"meaning skin contact, "
1118.07,or whether or not you grew up 
1119.42,"in a more animal sparse, contact sparse environment "
1123.61,and how that shapes your microbiome. 
1125.81,But the simple point is that what you eat 
1128.37,"influences your microbiome, but also what you do, "
1131.1,"what you think, and what you feel, "
1132.4,and many of the low microbacteria 
1135.14,that get into your digestive tract 
1137.44,do so by way of social interactions. 
1139.96,"In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist "
1142.55,"what the role of the microbiome is, "
1144.66,they'll tell you almost certainly 
1146.99,that it's there to impact brain function. 
1150.26,"But if you have friends that are microbiologists, "
1154.46,"such as I do, they'll tell you, "
1157.66,"well, maybe the brain and nervous system are there "
1159.76,to support the microbiome. 
1161.04,It's the other way around. 
1162.6,You have all these little microorganisms 
1164.11,that are taking residence in our body. 
1166.8,They don't really know what they're doing as far as we know. 
1169.48,We don't know that they have consciousness or they don't. 
1171.45,"We can't rule that out, but it seems pretty unlikely. "
1173.84,"Nonetheless, they are taking advantage "
1176.36,of the different environments 
1178.26,all along your digestive tract. 
1179.8,They are taking advantage 
1181.62,"of the sorts of social interactions, "
1183.83,"for instance, the people you talk to "
1184.957,"and that breathe on you, "
1186.26,"the people that you shake hands with, "
1188.01,"the people that you kiss or don't kiss, "
1190.14,the people that you happen to be 
1191.15,"romantically involved with or not, "
1192.89,"your dog, your cat, your lizard, your rat, "
1194.93,whatever pet you happen to own is impacting your microbiome. 
1199.12,There's absolutely no question about that. 
1201.1,So hopefully now you have some sense of the architecture 
1203.52,of the digestive pathway 
1205.36,and you have some sense of the trillions 
1208.26,of little microbacteria that are living 
1210.49,all along the different components 
1212.27,of that digestive pathway. 
1214.35,"But what we haven't talked about yet, "
1215.95,"and what I'd like to talk about now, "
1217.63,is what those little microbiota are actually doing 
1221.28,in your digestive tract. 
1223.15,In addition to just living there 
1224.34,"for their own intents and purposes, "
1226.35,"they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion. "
1229.51,Many of the genes that those microbiota make 
1232.86,are genes that are involved in fermentation 
1235.33,and genes that are involved in digestion 
1237.6,of particular types of nutrients. 
1240.05,"And in a little bit, we will talk "
1241.68,about how what you eat can actually change the enzymes 
1246.16,"that those microbiome components make, "
1249.15,enzymes largely being things 
1250.76,that are responsible for digestion. 
1252.75,They catalyze other sorts of cellular events 
1254.83,"but in the context of the digestive pathway, "
1256.91,we're talking about enzymes that help digest your food. 
1259.33,So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways. 
1262.8,And if you lack certain microbiota 
1264.46,"that can help you digest, "
1266.14,it stands to reason that you would have challenges 
1267.93,digesting certain types of foods. 
1269.98,The other amazing thing that these microbiota do 
1273.54,is they change the way that your brain functions 
1276.73,by way of metabolizing or facilitating 
1280.05,the metabolism of particular neurotransmitters. 
1283.23,So one of the ways that having certain microbiota present 
1285.9,"in your gut can improve your mood or degrade your mood, "
1289.82,"for instance, is by way of certain microbiota "
1294.56,being converted into or facilitating the conversion 
1298.17,"of chemicals, such as GABA. "
1301.02,GABA is what we call an inhibitory neurotransmitter. 
1304.55,It's involved in suppressing the action 
1307.53,of other neurons. 
1308.9,"And that might sound like a bad thing, "
1310.81,"but all types of sedatives, for instance, "
1314.11,"alcohol, and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA "
1317.89,"can help quiet certain circuits in the brain, "
1319.78,"for instance, circuits responsible for anxiety. "
1323.28,"In people who have epilepsy, "
1325.28,"the GABAergic neurons, as they're called, "
1327.81,"can all often be disrupted in their signaling, "
1330.56,meaning they're not cranking out as much GABA 
1332.62,"and therefore the excitatory neurons, "
1335.17,which typically release other molecules like glutamate 
1337.92,can engage in what's called runaway excitation 
1340.98,and that can give rise to seizures. 
1343.02,So the simple message here is that the microbiota 
1346.46,by way of making neurochemicals 
1348.87,can influence the way that your brain functions. 
1351.35,So you want to support those microbiota 
1353.04,and we will give you tools to support those microbiota. 
1356.83,But the takeaway at this point 
1359.31,is that those microbiota are making things locally 
1361.99,to help digest food. 
1363.47,Other microbiota are helping to make 
1366.08,"certain neurotransmitters like GABA, "
1368.04,and we'll also talk about dopamine and serotonin. 
1370.59,And so the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut 
1374.86,have a profound influence 
1376.29,"on many, many biological functions, "
1378.71,"especially immune system function, "
1381.1,"brain function, and digestion. "
1383.69,So that should give you a fairly complete picture 
1385.9,of your gut microbiome. 
1388.3,Now I'd like to talk about how your microbiome 
1390.72,"and your brain communicate, "
1392.46,"or more accurately, how your microbiome "
1394.33,and the rest of your nervous system communicate. 
1396.92,"Neurons, which simply means nerve cells, "
1399.65,are the cells that do most of the heavy lifting 
1402.37,in your nervous system. 
1403.32,There are of course other cell types that are important. 
1405.41,"Glial cell, for instance, very, very important cell types. "
1408.38,"You have endothelial cells, "
1409.74,"which are responsible for blood flow, "
1411.47,"pericytes and other types of cells, "
1413.75,but the neurons are really doing most of the heavy lifting 
1416.68,for most of the things we think about 
1418.44,in terms of nervous system function. 
1421.41,You have neurons in your gut 
1424.21,and that should not surprise you. 
1427.15,"Neurons reside in your brain, your spinal cord, your eyes, "
1429.94,"in fact, all over your body, "
1431.76,"and you've got them on your heart and in your heart, "
1434.07,"and you've got them in your lungs, "
1436.36,"and you've got them in your spleen, "
1438.26,and they connect to all the different organs 
1440.66,and tissues of your body. 
1442.82,So that's not surprising that you have neurons in your gut. 
1445.53,"What is surprising, however, "
1447.24,is the presence of particular types of neurons 
1449.97,that reside near or in the mucosal lining 
1453.92,just next to that lumen of the gut 
1456.78,"and that are paying attention, "
1458.91,"and I'll explain what I mean by paying attention, "
1460.83,"to the components of the gut, both the nutrients "
1464.095,"and the microbiota, "
1466.74,and thereby can send signals 
1469.84,up to the brain by way of a long wire 
1473.47,"that we call an axon, and can communicate "
1477.9,what the chemistry and what the nutritional quality 
1482.16,and what the other aspects of the environment are at the gut 
1484.94,at a given location up to the brain 
1487.67,"in ways that can influence the brain to, for instance, "
1489.95,seek out more of a particular food. 
1492.64,Let me give you a sort of action-based picture of this. 
1495.5,"Let's say like most people, you enjoy sweet foods. "
1499.26,I don't particularly enjoy sweet foods 
1500.88,but there are a few that I like. 
1501.95,I'm a sucker for a really good dark chocolate 
1505.5,or really good ice cream 
1507.36,or I got this thing for donuts 
1509.33,that seems to just not quit 
1510.86,"although I don't tend to indulge it very often, "
1513.36,I do like them. 
1515.22,"If I eat that particular food, "
1517.01,obviously digestion starts in the mouth. 
1519.47,"There are enzymes there, it gets chewed up, "
1521.07,the food goes down into the gut. 
1523.55,"These neurons are activated, "
1527.29,meaning that causes the neurons to be electrically active 
1530.83,"when particular components, "
1532.48,certain nutrients in those foods are present. 
1535.39,"And for the cell types, "
1537.3,"or I should say the neuron types that matter here, "
1540.58,the nutrients that really trigger their activation 
1543.47,"are sugar, fatty acids, "
1546.06,and amino acids. 
1548.42,"Now, these particular neurons "
1550.33,have the name enteroendocrine cells 
1553.21,but more recently they've been defined as neuropod cells. 
1557.46,Neuropod cells were discovered 
1558.63,by Diego Bohorquez's lab at Duke University. 
1562.28,This is a phenomenal set of discoveries 
1563.89,made mostly in the last 
10,years. 
1566.37,"These neuropod cells, as I mentioned, "
1568.76,"are activated by sugar, fatty acids, or amino acids, "
1572.57,but have a particularly strong activation to sugars. 
1577.43,They do seem to be part of the sweet sensing system. 
1580.43,"And even though I'm focusing on this particular example, "
1582.97,they represent a really nice example 
1585.72,of how a particular set of neuro cells in our gut 
1589.41,is collecting information about what is there 
1591.9,"at a particular location in the gut, "
1593.46,and sending that information up to our brain. 
1596.05,"Now, they do that by way of a nerve pathway "
1599.26,called the vagus nerve. 
1600.95,The vagus nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system. 
1603.24,And the vagus nerve is a little bit complex to describe 
1606.42,if you're just listening to this. 
1608.27,"If you are watching this, "
1609.49,I'll try and use my hands as a diagram 
1611.61,but really the best thing to do 
1613.34,if you want really want to learn neuroanatomy 
1615.65,is to just imagine it in your mind as best you can 
1618.08,"and if you can track down a picture of it, terrific, "
1619.89,but here's how it works. 
1621.84,"Neurons have a cell body that we call a soma, "
1624.13,that's where all the DNA are contained. 
1627.45,That's where a lot of the operating machinery 
1629.77,of the cells are contained 
1631.33,and a lot of the instructions for that cell 
1633.34,of what to be and how to operate are contained. 
1636.36,The cell bodies of these neurons or the relevant neurons 
1640.1,are actually up near the neck. 
1642.09,"So you can think of them as a clump of grapes, "
1645.33,'cause cell bodies tend to be round or oval-ish. 
1648.37,And then they send a process that we call an axon 
1652.84,in one direction out to the gut 
1656.46,and they'll send another process up into the brain. 
1660.54,And that little cluster near the neck 
1662.58,that's relevant here is called 
1663.907,"the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E. "
1667.38,The nodose ganglion is a little cluster of neurons 
1670.18,on either side of the neck. 
1671.89,It has a process that goes out to the gut 
1673.267,and a process that goes up into the brain. 
1675.387,"And again, these are just one component "
1677.84,of the so-called vagus nerve. 
1680.75,"The vagus nerve has many, many branches, "
1682.78,not just to the gut. 
1683.85,"There are also branches to the liver, "
1686.42,"branches to the lungs, "
1687.47,"branches to the heart, branches to the larynx, "
1690.47,"and even to the spleen, "
1691.99,and other areas of the body that are important. 
1694.9,But right now we're just concentrating on the neurons 
1696.74,that are in the gut that signal up to the brain. 
1699.24,And what the Bohorquez lab has shown 
1702.59,is that these neuropod cells are part of network. 
1705.76,"They're sensing several different nutrients, "
1708.32,"but in particular, when they sense sugar, "
1710.33,they send signals in the form of electrical firing 
1714.2,up to the brain in ways that trigger activation 
1717.13,of other brain stations that cause you to seek out more 
1720.94,of that particular food. 
1723.18,"Now, this brings us to some classic experiments "
1725.62,that at least to me are incredible. 
1728.44,And these are highly reproducible findings 
1730.77,"showing, for instance, "
1732.2,that even if you bypass taste 
1734.94,by infusing sweet liquid 
1737.96,"or putting sweet foods into the gut, "
1741.74,"and people can never taste them with their mouth, "
1744.51,people will seek out more of that particular food. 
1747.81,And if you give them the option 
1749.32,to have a sweet food infused into their gut 
1753.92,or a bitter food infused into their gut 
1756.87,"or a sweet versus sour, "
1759.17,"or a more sweet versus less sweet food, "
1761.8,people have a selective preference for sweet foods 
1765.21,even if they can't taste them. 
1767.33,"Now, this is important to understand "
1768.91,in the context of gut-brain signaling 
1770.45,because we always think that we like sweet foods 
1773.08,because of the way they taste. 
1774.8,"And indeed that's still true, "
1777.15,but much of what we consider the great taste of a sweet food 
1781.49,also has to do with a gut sensation 
1783.77,that is below our conscious detection. 
1786.38,How do we know that? 
1787.52,"Well, the Bohorquez lab has performed experiments "
1791.04,using modern methods and they're classic experiments 
1793.33,showing that animals and humans 
1795.34,will actively seek out more of a particular sweet food 
1798.96,even if it bypasses this taste system. 
1801.79,And the reverse is also true. 
1804.06,There have been experiments done in animals and in humans 
1807.28,that have allowed animals or humans 
1809.55,"to select and eat sweet foods, "
1811.78,and indeed that's what they do if they're given the option. 
1816.0,And yet to somehow eliminate the activation of these neurons 
1820.73,within the gut that can sense sweet foods. 
1823.7,"Now, there are a couple different ways "
1824.75,that those experiments ave been done. 
1826.24,In classic experiments that date back to the '
"80s,",
1829.47,this was done by what's called subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. 
1832.52,So this means cutting off the branch of the vagus 
1834.69,that enervates the gut below the diaphragm 
1837.2,so that the other organs can still function 
1838.96,"because the vagus is very important, "
1840.65,"but basically cutting off the sweet sensing in the gut, "
1843.46,still giving people the opportunity to taste sweet foods 
1845.75,"with their mouth, "
1846.583,and they don't actively seek out 
1848.49,quite as much of the sweet food 
1850.53,when they don't have this gut sensing mechanism 
1852.83,that we now know to be dependent on these neuropod cells. 
1857.06,More recent experiments involve selective silencing 
1859.6,of these neuropod cells. 
1861.17,And there have been a lot of different derivations 
1862.95,"of this sort of thing, "
1863.94,but the takeaway from it is that our experience of 
1867.04,and our desire for particular foods 
1869.07,has everything to do with how those foods taste. 
1871.5,"It also has to do, as you probably know, "
1873.84,with their texture and the sensation of those foods 
1877.67,"in our mouth, and even indeed how they go down our throat "
1880.69,sometimes can be very pleasing or very unpleasant. 
1884.41,And it also has to do with this subconscious processing 
1888.22,of taste that occurs in the gut itself. 
1891.92,"And again, when I say gut, I don't just mean in the stomach. "
1894.12,"There are actually neurons, neuropod cells, "
1897.31,further down your digestive tract 
1899.07,which are signaling to your brain 
1900.91,"about the presence of sweet foods, "
1902.44,as well as foods such as amino acid rich foods 
1906.11,or foods that are rich in particular types of fatty acids 
1909.43,signaling up to your brain 
1911.74,and causing you to seek out more of those foods 
1914.85,or to consume more of those foods. 
1917.2,"Now, you're probably asking, what is the signal? "
1919.33,How does it actually make me want more of those foods 
1921.93,without me realizing it? 
1923.33,"Well, it does that by adjusting the release "
1925.39,of particular neuromodulators. 
1927.84,"For those of you that are not familiar with neuromodulators, "
1930.23,"these are similar to neurotransmitters, "
1931.79,but they tend to act more broadly. 
1933.8,They tend to impact many more neurons all at once 
1936.27,"and they go by names like dopamine, serotonin, "
1939.03,"acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so forth. "
1941.67,Sometimes people refer to those as neurotransmitters. 
1944.18,Technically they are neuromodulators. 
1945.89,I'll refer to them almost always as neuromodulators. 
1948.87,The neuropod cells signal by way 
1951.53,of a particular branch of the vagus 
1953.92,through that nodose ganglion that we talked about before 
1956.99,and through a number of different stations 
1959.77,"in the brain stem, "
1960.88,eventually cause the release of the neuromodulator dopamine. 
1966.02,Dopamine is often associated 
1968.04,with a sense of pleasure and reward 
1969.81,but it is more appropriately thought of as a neuromodulator 
1973.25,"that impacts motivation, craving, and pursuit. "
1975.85,"It tends to put us into modes of action, "
1977.87,"not necessarily running and moving through space, "
1980.62,"although it can do that too, but in the context of feeding, "
1983.39,"it tends to make us look around more, "
1987.02,"chew more, reach for things more, "
1989.14,and seek out more of whatever it is 
1990.75,that's giving us that sensation 
1993.07,of delight or satisfaction. 
1995.75,"And again, that sense of delight and satisfaction, "
1998.64,you might experience only consciously 
2001.0,as the way that something tastes on your mouth 
2003.31,but it actually is caused again 
2005.24,by both the sensations in your mouth 
2007.85,but also by the activation of these neuropod cells. 
2011.12,"So this is an incredible system of gut-brain signaling, "
2014.15,and it is but one system of gut-brain signaling. 
2016.74,It turns out it's the system that we know the most about 
2019.78,at this point in time. 
2021.17,There are other components of gut-brain signaling 
2023.19,"that we'll talk about in a moment, for instance, "
2024.84,the serotonin system. 
2026.9,But in terms of examples of gut-brain signaling 
2029.47,for which we know a lot of the individual elements 
2031.85,"and how they work, "
2032.87,"I think this neuropod, neuron sensing of sweet foods, "
2037.33,"fatty acids, and amino acids in the gut "
2039.47,and communicating that up to the brain 
2042.36,by way of the vagus and causing us 
2044.11,to seek out more of the foods 
2045.43,that deliver those nutrients is an incredible pathway 
2048.89,that really delineates the beauty and the power 
2051.38,of this gut-brain axis. 
2053.29,Let me talk about timescales. 
2054.57,Here I'm talking about a particular type of neuron 
2057.28,that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals 
2060.94,to cause us to want to seek out 
2063.08,a particular category of foods. 
2066.8,That's happening relatively fast 
2068.8,compared to the hormone pathways of the gut 
2071.11,which also involve neurons. 
2072.64,So your gut is also communicating to your brain 
2075.13,"by way of neurons, nerve cells. "
2078.61,But some of those nerve cells also release hormones. 
2081.96,"And those hormones go by names like CCK, "
2084.33,glucagon-like peptide 
"1,","PYY, et cetera. "
2089.1,"A good example of a hormone pathway, "
2091.73,"or what's sometimes called a hormone peptide pathway, "
2094.46,that is similar to the pathway I've talked about before 
2098.21,but a little bit slower is the ghrelin pathway. 
2101.77,"Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N, "
2104.87,increases with fasting. 
2107.66,"So the longer it's been since you've eaten, "
2110.14,or if you're just eating very little food 
2112.24,"compared to your caloric needs, "
2114.06,ghrelin levels are going to go up in your bloodstream 
2116.4,and they go up because of processes 
2118.77,that include processes within the gut 
2121.18,and include the nervous system. 
2122.94,So it's a slow pathway driving you 
2124.87,to seek out food generally. 
2127.09,"As far as we know, the ghrelin system is not partial "
2130.12,to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or so on. 
2135.59,Ghrelin increases the longer it's been 
2138.55,since you've eaten sufficient calories 
2140.61,and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food. 
2144.17,"Well, how does it do that? "
2146.03,It does that again by impacting neural circuits 
2148.32,"within the brain, neural circuits that include "
2150.72,what we call the brain stem autonomic center. 
2152.85,So it tends to make you feel alert 
2154.91,"and quite, we say, high levels of autonomic arousal. "
2158.52,"If you haven't eaten in a while, "
2159.97,"you might think that you just get really exhausted, right? "
2162.2,Because we all hear that food is energy 
2163.9,"and caloric energy is what we need to burn, "
2165.99,but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body 
2168.4,that you would be able to use 
2170.66,if you really needed energy. 
2172.85,"But typically if we haven't eaten in a while, "
2174.38,we start to get agitated 
2175.88,and we get agitated by way way of release 
2177.79,"of the neuromodulator epinephrine, "
2180.05,"which causes us to look around more, move around more, "
2182.95,and seek out food. 
2185.13,That all occurs in brain stem autonomic centers 
2187.54,and in the hypothalamus. 
2188.58,We did an entire episode on feeding behavior 
2190.96,and metabolism as well 
2192.67,and you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com 
2194.79,so I don't want to go into a lot of detail 
2196.47,about hypothalamic and brains stem centers. 
2198.71,But there's a particular area of the brain 
2200.8,"called the nucleus of the solitary tract, "
2203.27,"the NST as it's called, that's very strongly impacted "
2206.74,by these circulating hormones 
2208.28,and tends to drive us toward feeding behavior. 
2210.73,So the important point here is that we have a fast system 
2213.96,that is paying attention to the nutrients in our gut 
2216.09,"or the absence of nutrients in our gut, "
2217.71,and stimulating us to seek out food 
2219.6,"or to stop eating certain foods, "
2221.35,and we have a slower hormone-related system 
2224.71,that also originates in the gut and impacts the brain. 
2227.54,But all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding. 
2232.36,The neural circuits for feeding 
2233.52,"include things like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, "
2235.87,"they include a bunch of other neurochemicals, "
2238.05,but the point is that you've got a fast route 
2240.44,"and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat less, "
2244.8,"right, to seek out food and consume it or to stop eating, "
2248.79,to essentially kickstart the satiety mechanisms 
2252.49,"as they're called, "
2253.74,and those are operating in parallel. 
2255.83,It's not like one happens first 
2257.2,then stops then the other. 
2258.07,They're always operating in parallel. 
2259.67,And I bring this up because there's a bigger theme here 
2262.06,"which we see over and over again in biology, "
2264.28,which is the concept of parallel pathways. 
2266.17,You've always got multiple accelerators and multiple brakes 
2269.21,on a system. 
2270.043,"It's very, very rare to have just one accelerator "
2272.2,and one brake on the system. 
2273.61,And this will become important later 
2274.93,when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome 
2278.3,for healthy eating and for health healthy digestion 
2280.61,and for healthy brain function. 
2282.07,I want to take a moment and talk 
2283.21,about glucagon-like peptide 
"1,",
2285.88,which is also called GLP-
1.,
2289.895,GLP-
1,is made by neurons in the gut 
2293.8,and by neurons in the brain. 
2295.693,This is a fairly recent discovery 
2298.73,but it's an important one. 
2300.3,GLP-
1,tends to inhibit feeding 
2304.21,and tends to reduce appetite. 
2307.63,"There are a number of drugs released on the market now, "
2311.84,"one for instance goes by the name semaglutide, "
2314.81,which is essentially an GLP-
1,agonist. 
2318.28,It causes the release of more GLP-
1.,
2320.42,"It's being used to treat type II diabetes, "
2322.6,which is insulin resistant diabetes. 
2324.42,This is different than type I diabetes 
2326.36,where people don't actually make insulin. 
2328.79,It's also being used as a drug to reduce obesity. 
2334.02,And it seems pretty effective 
2335.61,at least in certain populations. 
2337.94,There are certain foods and substances that increase GLP-
1.,
2341.22,I've talked about a few of these on the podcast. 
2343.32,One that I'm a particular fan of for entirely other reasons 
2346.04,is yerba mate tea can stimulate the release of GLP-
1.,
2350.62,"In South America, it's often used "
2352.01,"as an appetite suppressant, "
2353.28,probably in large part 
2354.41,because of its effect on GLP-
1,"release, "
2357.84,"but probably also because it does contain caffeine, "
2360.4,"which is a bit of a stimulant, "
2361.53,"which also can be involved in lipolysis, "
2363.32,which is the utilization of fat stores 
2364.97,for energy and so forth. 
2367.4,A brief mention about yerba mate. 
2369.95,There are some reports out there that yerba mate 
2372.69,can increase certain types of cancers. 
2375.28,The data that I've seen on this 
2377.87,is that it tends to relate to whether or not 
2379.76,"those are smoked versions of the yerba mate tea, "
2382.5,"the amount of consumption, "
2384.37,and the debate is still out. 
2385.72,So I invite you to look at those papers. 
2387.37,You can search for those online. 
2390.81,"Nonetheless, yerba mate is one source of GLP-"
1,stimulation. 
2395.2,Semaglutide is another source. 
2396.75,"It also can be stimulated by various foods, nuts, "
2399.12,"avocados, eggs, and so forth. "
2401.92,Certain high fiber complex grains 
2404.3,will also stimulate GLP-
1.,
2406.74,I raise this as not necessarily a route 
2409.94,that you want to take in order to reduce food intake. 
2412.71,I don't even know that that's your goal. 
2414.56,But that GLP-
1,is another one 
2418.62,of these gut-to-brain signaling mechanisms 
2420.69,"that adjusts appetite that is dependent on diet, "
2424.55,"depends on what you eat or drink, "
2426.78,and that the GLP-
1,pathway 
2428.8,does seem particularly sensitive 
2430.65,to the constituents of diet. 
2432.68,There's at least one quality study 
2434.45,I was able to find showing 
2435.45,"that the ketogenic diet for instance, "
2437.51,which almost always involves ingestion 
2440.4,of very low levels of carbohydrate 
2442.27,can increase GLP-
1.,
2444.14,"Although, as I mentioned before, "
2445.26,there are other foods that fall 
2446.49,outside the range of what we would consider ketogenic 
2449.37,that can also stimulate GLP-
"1,",
2450.92,"and as I mentioned, "
2451.753,"there are prescription drugs, like semaglutide, "
2454.01,"there are other ones as well now, "
2455.28,that stimulate GLP-
1.,
2457.51,So how does GLP-
1,reduce appetite? 
2459.5,"It does that, in part, by changing the activity of neurons "
2462.81,"in the hypothalamus, "
2463.643,"this cluster of neurons just above the roof of our mouth, "
2466.92,that themselves make GLP-
1,
2469.74,and that cause the activation of motor circuits 
2472.92,"for reaching, chewing, all the things "
2475.563,that we associate with feeding behavior. 
2478.07,So I use GLP-
1,as an example of a pathway 
2480.39,that you might choose to tap into 
2482.04,by ingestion of yerba mate 
2483.5,"or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned, "
2485.23,"or if it's something that interests you, ketogenic diet. "
2488.09,But I also mention it simply 
2490.11,because it's another beautiful example 
2492.66,of how a hormone pathway can impact the activity 
2495.45,of brain circuits that are directly involved 
2497.6,in a particular behavior. 
2499.4,So yet another example of how gut is communicating to brain 
2503.58,in order to change what we think we want 
2506.45,or to change what our actual behaviors are. 
2509.1,"So the next time you find yourself reaching for food, "
2511.43,or you find yourself wanting a particular sweet thing 
2515.44,or fatty thing or something that contains 
2518.15,"a lot of amino acids, "
2519.55,"a protein rich food, "
2521.67,keep in mind that that's not just 
2523.23,"about the taste of the food, "
2524.62,and it's not even necessarily about the nutrients 
2526.69,that you need or don't need. 
2528.41,"It could be, "
2529.243,but it's also about this subconscious signaling 
2531.5,"that's coming from your body all the time, "
2533.4,"waves of hormones, waves of nerve cell signals, "
2537.53,electrical signals that are changing the way 
2539.67,that your brain works. 
2541.47,And this raises for me 
2543.17,"a memory of the episode that I did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky, "
2547.84,"who's a world expert colleague of mine at Stanford, "
2550.54,who is expert on things like hormones and behavior. 
2554.23,"But we got into the topic of free will, "
2556.37,which is a bit of a barbed wire topic 
2558.53,as many of you know. 
2559.363,"It gets into the realm of philosophy, et cetera. "
2561.147,And we were kind of batting back and forth 
2563.34,"the idea, I was saying, ""Well, I think there's free will, "
2566.95,and can't there certainly be free will 
2568.78,"or certainly the idea that we can avoid certain choices?"" "
2573.02,"And Robert was saying, ""No."" "
2575.94,"In fact, he said, ""Nah,"" he doesn't believe "
2578.76,that we have any free will. 
2579.85,He thinks that events in our brain are determined 
2583.04,by biological events that are below our conscious detection 
2586.81,and that occur seconds to milliseconds 
2589.08,before we make decisions or assessments 
2591.28,"and, therefore, we just can't control what we do, "
2594.54,"what we think, and what we feel. "
2596.37,And at the time I sort of didn't buy it. 
2599.08,"I thought, I don't know. "
2600.51,"I just, I guess I really wanted to believe in free will. "
2603.28,And to some extent I still do 
2605.04,but as we talk about how these neurons in our gut 
2607.377,and these hormones in our gut are influencing our brain 
2610.65,"and the decisions that we are making, "
2612.34,"at the level of circuits, like the hypothalamus "
2614.69,"and the nucleus of the solitary tract, "
2616.56,these are areas of the brain way below our frontal cortex 
2619.67,and our conscious perception. 
2622.05,Think these are examples that really fall 
2623.78,"in favor of what Dr. Sapolsky was arguing, "
2626.95,which is that events that are happening within our body 
2629.65,are actually changing the way our brain works. 
2631.2,So we might think that we want the cupcake. 
2633.26,We might think that we don't need to eat something 
2636.83,or do need to eat something 
2638.17,and that is entirely on the basis of prior knowledge 
2641.7,"and decision-making that we're making with our head, "
2644.05,"but in fact, "
2644.94,it's very clear to me based on the work 
2647.07,"from the Bohorquez lab, "
2648.45,classic work over the years dating back to the '
"80s,",
2651.0,and indeed back to the '
50s,
2652.21,"that we'll talk about in a moment, "
2653.72,that our body is shaping the decisions 
2656.43,that our brain is making and we're not aware of it at all. 
2659.63,"Now, the good news is that whether or not you believe "
2661.9,"in free will or not, the simple knowledge "
2664.12,that this whole process is happening 
2666.34,can perhaps be a benefit to you. 
2667.93,You can perhaps leverage it to get some insight 
2671.11,and understanding and perhaps even a wedge 
2672.84,into your own behavior. 
2673.7,"You might think, ah, I think I want that particular food, "
2677.18,"or I think I want to avoid that particular food, "
2679.54,but actually that's not a decision 
2681.95,that I'm making on a purely rational basis. 
2684.2,Has a lot to do with what my gut is telling my brain. 
2687.03,So we've largely been talking about chemical communication 
2690.16,between the gut and the brain. 
2691.77,Chemical because even though these neuropod cells 
2695.63,are communicating with the brain 
2697.04,"by way of electrical activity, "
2699.08,"what we call action potentials, "
2700.66,"and in neural language we call those spikes, "
2703.4,"spikes of action potentials, "
2706.58,"spikes of action potentials, "
2709.4,"meaning those neural signals, "
2710.63,cause the release of chemicals in the brain like dopamine. 
2715.45,So it's chemical transmission. 
2718.55,"Similarly, hormones, even though they act more slowly, "
2721.41,"hormones like neuropeptide Y like CCK, like ghrelin, "
2726.0,they are signaling chemically. 
2728.07,"They're moving through the body, "
2730.14,they're going in there affecting the chemical output 
2732.99,"of different cells, "
2734.17,and they're changing the chemistry of those cells 
2735.937,and the chemistry of the cells that those cells talk to. 
2738.65,So that gives us one particular category of signaling 
2741.62,"from gut to brain, which is chemical signaling. "
2744.94,But of course there are other forms of signals 
2747.56,and those fall under the category of mechanical signaling. 
2751.55,You're probably familiar with this. 
2752.87,If you've ever eaten a very large meal 
2754.84,"or consumed a lot of fluid, "
2756.74,you experience that as distension of the gut 
2759.25,"and that doesn't just have to be distension of the stomach, "
2762.36,but distension of your intestines as well. 
2766.1,That distension is registered by neurons 
2768.29,"that reside in your gut, "
2769.91,"the signals go up to your brain, "
2771.25,and communicate with areas of the brain 
2772.82,that are responsible for suppressing 
2774.92,"further consumption of food and/or fluid, "
2777.74,"and, under certain circumstances, "
2780.2,can also be associated with the activation 
2782.94,of neural circuits that cause vomiting 
2784.82,or the desire to vomit. 
2786.07,So if ever you've eaten too much or you've eaten something 
2788.87,"that doesn't agree with you, "
2790.29,that information is communicated 
2792.54,by way of mechanosensors 
2793.97,"that sense the mechanics of your gut, "
2796.21,"possibly also the chemistry of your gut, "
2797.91,"but mostly the mechanics of your gut, "
2800.01,"signal up to the brain, "
2801.52,and activate brain centers that are involved 
2803.63,"in stopping the eating behavior, "
2806.68,and activation of an area of the brain stem 
2810.49,that is affectionately referred to 
2812.34,as the vomit center among neuroanatomists. 
2815.09,This is a area that more appropriately 
2817.83,"is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the CTZ, "
2820.84,or area postrema 
2822.07,and neurons in this area actually will trigger 
2824.84,the vomiting reflex. 
2826.82,So the way that the gut and the brain communicate 
2830.13,"is both chemical and mechanical, "
2832.0,and it can be both for sake 
2833.45,of increasing certain types of behavior. 
2836.97,"Today, we're talking mainly about feeding behavior "
2838.8,up until now anyway 
2840.47,"but also ceasing to eat, closing your mouth, "
2844.01,"moving away from food, turning away from food, "
2846.86,all behaviors that we're familiar with 
2848.31,anytime we feel kind of sick 
2849.61,on the basis of activation of this mechanosensor 
2853.5,for gastric distress. 
2855.54,So we've got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling. 
2858.39,And I also want to emphasize that we have 
2860.49,direct and indirect signaling from the gut to the brain. 
2864.07,Direct signaling is the kind of signaling 
2866.28,"of the sort I've been talking about mainly up until now, "
2868.76,which is neurons in the gut 
2871.4,communicating with neurons in the brain stem 
2873.19,that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus. 
2875.41,"And, of course, those are also going to interact "
2877.38,with neurons of the prefrontal cortex 
2879.5,which is the area of a brain involved in decision making 
2881.61,"the, you know, I think it was the shrimp that made me sick. "
2885.26,"I'm going to, I just don't want any more of that. "
2887.35,Or I'm never going back to that restaurant again 
2890.17,"because after I ate there about an hour later, "
2893.0,I started feeling really not well. 
2894.61,"I felt, you know, kind of feverish, "
2895.99,"but my gut didn't feel well, "
2897.09,my digestion was really off. 
2899.14,All of that kind of information 
2900.31,"is handled in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level, "
2903.76,but the immediate decision to stop eating 
2906.03,or to eat more of something to move towards something 
2908.3,"or away from it, that's made by neural circuits "
2910.43,"that reside at the, we would say, "
2912.73,the subconscious level 
2914.19,but what we really mean is below the level of the neocortex. 
2916.86,Below the cortex means essentially below our level 
2919.73,of conscious awareness. 
2921.03,So we talked about two types of information within the gut 
2923.7,"that are communicated to the brain, "
2925.35,"chemical information, meaning information "
2927.34,"about the nutrients that happen to be there, "
2929.13,"and mechanical information, "
2929.963,distention of the gut or lack of distention and so forth. 
2933.44,And we talked about how these neuropod cells 
2935.59,can signal the release of dopamine and circuits 
2937.46,within the brain to cause you to seek out more of something. 
2940.61,"Now, in a very logically consistent way, "
2944.7,dopamine is also involved in the whole business of vomiting. 
2948.83,"You might think, well, that doesn't make any sense. "
2950.39,I thought dopamine was always a good thing. 
2952.14,"It's involved in moderation and reward, et cetera. "
2954.81,"But it turns out the area postrema, "
2956.58,"this vomit center in the brain stem, "
2959.49,is chockablock full of dopamine receptors. 
2962.13,"And if dopamine levels go too high, "
2964.73,it can actually trigger vomiting. 
2966.41,And this we see in the context of various drugs 
2969.52,that are used to treat things like Parkinson's. 
2971.62,Parkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine 
2974.053,or a lack of dopamine neurons typically 
2976.17,"that causes a resting tremor, "
2977.49,"difficulty in movement, "
2978.64,because dopamine's also associated 
2980.0,with a lot of the neural circuits for movement. 
2983.19,Many drugs that are used to treat Parkinson's 
2986.01,"like L-DOPA increase levels of dopamine so much, "
2989.92,or at least activate dopamine receptors 
2992.88,to such a great degree in certain areas of the brain 
2995.95,that they can cause activation of things 
2998.41,like the trigger to vomit. 
3001.75,"Now, this should also make sense in the natural context "
3004.24,"of if you gorge yourself with food, "
3005.82,"gorge yourself with food, gorge yourself with food, "
3008.14,the neurons in your gut that respond to that 
3011.22,are simply detecting the presence of nutrients 
3013.54,but they don't really make decisions themselves. 
3016.38,They don't know to stop eating. 
3018.14,Your brain knows to stop eating or to eject that food. 
3021.25,And so it's a wonderful thing that those neurons 
3023.61,are communicating with areas of the brain 
3025.61,not just that stimulate consuming more food 
3027.93,"but that are communicating with areas of the brain, "
3031.12,"for instance, area postrema, "
3032.78,"that when dopamine levels get too high, "
3035.97,cause us to either stop eating that food 
3038.86,or in the case of vomiting to eject that food. 
3041.95,So I raise this not to give you 
3044.39,a kind of a disgusting counterexample 
3046.77,"to what we call appetitive behaviors, "
3049.04,"the things that we like to do more of, "
3051.12,but simply to give you a sense of just how strongly 
3054.49,even these reflexes that we think of 
3056.38,as feeling sick and vomiting 
3058.27,or the desire to seek out more food 
3060.26,"are really being controlled by a kind of push-pull system, "
3063.23,by parallel pathways that are arriving from our gut 
3065.47,"and the same neurochemicals, in this case dopamine, "
3068.19,"are being used to create two opposite type behaviors, "
3072.19,"one behavior to consume more, "
3073.75,one behavior to get rid of everything 
3075.24,you've already consumed. 
3076.51,So our brain is actually sensitive 
3078.64,to the amount of signaling coming from our gut 
3081.44,not just the path by which that signal arrives. 
3085.04,Our brain is very carefully paying attention 
3088.87,to whether or not the levels of dopamine 
3090.45,that are being triggered are within a normal range 
3092.91,for typical eating behavior 
3094.26,or whether or not we've gorged ourselves 
3095.74,to the point where enough already. 
3097.67,"Now, of course, mechanical signals "
3100.06,will also play into area postrema 
3103.75,and into the vomiting reflex. 
3105.02,"If we have a very distended gut, "
3106.44,we feel lousy. 
3107.3,"It just, it actually can hurt very badly, "
3109.53,"and we will have the desire to vomit, "
3111.53,or we will just simply vomit. 
3114.96,Mechanical and chemical signals 
3116.59,are always arriving in parallel. 
3118.38,They never work in unison. 
3120.98,"And so now we have chemical signals, mechanical signals, "
3124.7,and now I'd like to talk about direct and indirect signals 
3127.61,because almost everything I've talked about up until now 
3130.64,"are direct signals, a neural pathway that converges "
3133.01,"in the brain to create a particular feeling, "
3134.7,"thought, or behavior, "
3135.95,but there are also indirect pathways. 
3138.32,And that's what takes us back to the gut microbiome 
3141.27,and to these little microbiota. 
3142.91,And to just give you the takeaway message at the front here 
3146.23,and then I'll give you a little more detail 
3148.41,"as to how it comes about, "
3150.8,you have neurotransmitters in your brain 
3153.87,and in your spinal cord and in your eyes 
3155.58,and in your peripheral nervous system. 
3157.27,They cause the activation or the suppression 
3159.85,"of nerve activity, "
3161.13,meaning they either electrically activate other nerve cells 
3164.1,or they cause other nerve cells 
3165.29,to be less electrically active. 
3166.96,And they do that by way of neurotransmitters. 
3170.15,"But as it turns out, "
3171.56,the gut microbiota are capable 
3173.95,of influencing metabolic events 
3175.78,and in some cases are capable 
3177.4,of synthesizing neurotransmitters themselves. 
3180.23,"So what that means is that these little bugs, "
3182.54,"these little microbiota that are cargo in your gut, "
3185.16,"the six pounds of cargo, "
3186.79,they actually can make neurochemicals 
3188.58,that can pass into the bloodstream 
3190.55,and into your brain and actually impact 
3192.48,"the other cells of your body and brain indirectly, "
3195.57,so without involving these very intricate nerve pathways 
3198.13,that we've been talking about. 
3199.74,"In other words, the foods you eat, "
3203.49,"the environment of your gut microbiome, "
3205.8,can actually create the chemical substrates 
3207.95,"that allow your brain to feel one way or the other, "
3210.36,"to feel great or to feel lousy, "
3212.2,to seek out more of a particular type of behavior 
3214.95,or to avoid that behavior. 
3216.36,And that would constitute indirect signaling. 
3218.8,So I've been talking a lot about the structure and function 
3221.36,"of the gut-to-brain pathway, "
3223.03,focusing mainly on feeding behaviors 
3225.88,and in some cases avoiding feeding or even ejecting food 
3229.14,"from the digestive tract, "
3231.07,I'd like to drill a little bit deeper 
3232.79,into this indirect signaling pathway 
3235.16,from the gut to the brain 
3236.36,because it bridges us nicely from neuronal signals 
3240.08,"in the gut to the brain, "
3241.5,"hormonal signals from the gut to the brain, "
3244.07,"to what also includes the microbiome, "
3246.57,which is what we started talking about 
3248.07,at the beginning of the episode. 
3250.77,"As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, "
3254.27,certain gut microbiota can actually synthesize 
3257.01,certain neurotransmitters that can go impact the brain. 
3259.71,And we actually have some knowledge about which microbiota 
3262.92,can synthesize particular neurotransmitters. 
3265.24,"For instance, the neuromodulator dopamine "
3268.24,can be synthesized 
3269.36,by or from bacillus and serratia. 
3274.09,"Now, these are just names of microbiota. "
3276.3,I don't expect that any of you 
3277.75,would necessarily recognize them. 
3279.11,These aren't the sorts of things that you necessarily 
3280.59,would run out and buy to get more dopamine. 
3283.19,But the point is that particular gut microbiota 
3287.24,can create dopamine in our gut 
3289.79,that can get into our bloodstream 
3291.35,and can generally change our baseline levels of dopamine 
3295.15,within the brain and other areas of the body. 
3298.21,I mentioned baseline levels of dopamine 
3300.04,because as I talked about on an episode all about dopamine 
3303.53,"but I'll just repeat the basics here now, "
3307.17,we have baseline levels 
3308.56,of transmitters or neuromodulators 
3310.99,"that act as sort of the level of the tide, "
3313.63,"the overall level, "
3314.94,and then we can have peaks of dopamine 
3316.88,that are created by behaviors 
3318.44,"or by ingestion of particular foods or drugs, et cetera. "
3321.71,So bacillus and serratia tend to increase 
3325.42,our baseline levels of dopamine. 
3328.15,So if it turns out that we are creating 
3330.9,the right gut microbiome environment 
3333.81,"that these particular gut microbiota can thrive in, "
3338.01,"well, then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated "
3341.4,"and in general, that leads to enhancement of mood. "
3344.9,"Similarly, there are other gut microbiota, "
3348.63,"for instance, candida, streptococus, various enterococcus, "
3353.29,these always have these kind of strange 
3354.98,"and not so attractive names, at least to me "
3357.09,as a neurobiologist. 
3358.44,"Nonetheless, those particular microbiota "
3361.86,support the production of or can even be metabolized 
3365.6,"into serotonin, which is a neuromodulator "
3368.85,"associated with mood, with social interactions, "
3372.02,with a huge number of different types 
3374.0,of events and behaviors. 
3375.81,"Again, these gut microbiota when present "
3380.24,and allowed to thrive in our gut 
3382.03,will increase our overall levels of serotonin 
3385.67,and riding on top of that level of serotonin 
3389.02,will be the serotonin that's specifically released 
3391.73,in response to certain behaviors. 
3393.67,And I really want to drive home this point 
3395.98,of baselines and peaks. 
3397.73,"The baseline level of serotonin might set our overall mood, "
3400.79,whether or not we wake up feeling pretty good 
3402.947,or really lousy if our serotonin levels 
3405.79,"happen to be very, very low, "
3407.42,whether or not we tend to be in a kind of a calm space 
3410.13,or whether or not we tend to be somewhat irritable. 
3412.53,"But then of course individual events as we go about our day, "
3416.08,maybe a compliment that we get 
3417.49,"or maybe somebody says something irritating to us, "
3419.9,"whatever it may be will also influence levels of serotonin, "
3422.92,but those serotonin events are going to be related 
3425.83,to events at particular neural circuits in the brain. 
3428.92,And this is an important topic 
3430.54,"because I think that a lot of people hear quite accurately, "
3434.13,"oh, "
90,to 
95%,of our serotonin is manufactured in the gut. 
3438.4,And indeed that's true. 
3439.32,It's manufactured from the sorts of microbiota 
3441.81,that I just described. 
3443.74,"And there are many, many experiments now, "
3445.18,"mostly in animal models, "
3446.32,but also some in humans that show that if the gut microbiome 
3450.36,"is deficient in some way to these particular bacteria, "
3454.92,"that serotonin levels drop and people's mood suffers, "
3457.46,"maybe even their immune system functions, "
3459.52,maybe even it exacerbates certain psychiatric illnesses. 
3463.88,"However, a lot of people take that to mean "
3465.66,that the serotonin of the brain all comes from the gut 
3470.13,or mostly comes from the gut. 
3471.6,That's not the case. 
3472.433,It's still the case that you have neurons in the brain 
3474.87,that are responsible for releasing serotonin 
3477.26,directly in response to certain things like social touch 
3480.2,or through other types of positive social experiences. 
3484.16,So we've got gut microbiota 
3487.55,that can literally be turned into dopamine 
3490.12,and raise our baseline levels of dopamine. 
3491.84,We've got gut microbiota 
3493.01,that can literally raise our baseline levels of serotonin. 
3496.41,And indeed there are other gut microbiota like lactobacillus 
3499.77,"or bifidobacterium, excuse me, "
3503.98,"hard complex names to pronounce, "
3506.14,bifidobacterium that can give rise 
3509.07,"to increases in GABA levels, "
3510.92,this inhibitory neurotransmitter 
3512.41,"that can act as a little bit of a mild sedative, "
3514.78,"can reduce irritability, et cetera, "
3517.28,"but that's just the baseline, "
3518.96,the kind of tide of those neuromodulators. 
3521.32,"Again, I want to emphasize that we still have "
3522.543,neurocircuits within the brain and body 
3524.7,that are specifically releasing in a very potent way 
3527.9,"dopamine, serotonin, and GABA. "
3530.12,So the two things act in concert. 
3532.31,Even though the gut and the brain are acting 
3534.67,"both in parallel and directly influencing one another, "
3539.13,it is a powerful synergistic effect. 
3541.86,"And there are now hundreds of studies, "
3544.27,"maybe even thousands by this point, "
3546.86,"mostly performed in animal models, "
3549.56,"typically mice, but also some studies in humans "
3552.29,that show that creating the correct environment 
3555.59,for these gut microbiota to thrive 
3557.35,really does enhance mood and wellbeing. 
3560.6,"And that when our gut microbiome is not healthy, "
3565.24,that it really can deplete our mood and sense of wellbeing. 
3568.83,"Now, there are two major phases "
3571.54,to creating a healthy gut microbiome. 
3573.95,One you can control and the other one 
3576.15,is less under your control. 
3578.66,I get into this in a lot of detail 
3580.89,"in the episode with Dr. Sonnenburg, "
3582.78,"which is coming out immediately after this one, "
3586.56,"the following Monday, that is. "
3588.54,But for now I want to just capture a few of the main points 
3592.47,about the early establishment of the gut microbiome. 
3596.72,It turns out that the environment 
3599.76,"that we are exposed to, "
3601.11,the things that come into contact with our skin 
3602.85,"and digestive tract and any other mucosal lining, "
3605.48,"even the urethra, the nasal passages, "
3608.42,any opening to the outside world 
3611.02,"that brings in certain, excuse me, "
3613.64,certain microbiota in the first three years of life 
3617.85,is going to have a profound impact 
3620.16,on the overall menu of microbiota 
3622.96,that we will be able to carry within our body. 
3627.33,And it really does seem that getting exposure to 
3630.36,and building a diverse microbiome 
3632.35,in those first three years is critical. 
3634.93,There's a lot of speculation and some data 
3637.61,as to cesarean delivered babies 
3640.55,having less diverse microbiomes 
3643.14,compared to vaginally delivered babies. 
3644.8,"There have been attempts, "
3645.99,"although not conclusive attempts, "
3648.02,"to link that to the presence of autism spectrum disorders, "
3651.64,which at least by some statistics 
3653.62,seem to be of higher probability in cesarean deliveries 
3657.82,"although there are other studies that refute that, "
3660.45,and I want to make that clear. 
3663.11,"However, it's clear that babies do not get much, "
3666.27,"if any, exposure to microbiota inside of the womb, "
3670.47,"maybe a little bit, but not much. "
3671.92,But that is during the birth process 
3673.69,and in the days and weeks immediately after 
3677.3,they arrive in the world that their gut microbiome 
3679.97,"is established, that those gut microbiota "
3682.58,take residence within the gut. 
3684.41,So it will depend on whether or not they were breastfed 
3686.5,or bottle fed. 
3687.4,It'll depend on whether or not they were exposed 
3689.46,"to a household pet or not, "
3690.82,whether or not they were held by multiple caregivers 
3693.4,"or just by one, "
3694.3,whether or not they were a preemie baby 
3696.22,and were contained in a particularly restrictive environment 
3699.73,in order to encourage their further development 
3701.57,before they could be brought home or not. 
3703.73,I don't want to give the picture that if you were isolated 
3706.75,"or you were delivered by C-section, "
3708.79,that you're somehow doomed to have a poor microbiome. 
3710.83,That's simply not the case. 
3712.56,"However, it is the case that the more diversity "
3715.57,of microbiota that one can create early in life 
3720.09,is really helpful for long-term outcomes 
3723.41,"in terms of brain-to-gut signaling, "
3726.46,"gut-to-brain signaling, "
3727.87,and for sake of the immune system. 
3731.83,There are some decent studies showing 
3734.18,that if children are exposed 
3736.33,"to a lot of antibiotic treatment early in life, "
3739.6,that can be very detrimental to establishment 
3741.97,of a healthy gut microbiome. 
3743.8,And fortunately that reestablishing a healthy gut microbiome 
3747.32,can help rescue some of those deficits. 
3749.71,So doctors nowadays are much more cautious 
3752.57,about the prescription of antibiotic drugs to children 
3756.2,"in their early years, not just up to three years, "
3758.26,but extending out to five and seven and 
10,years. 
3761.02,"And even in adults, they're very, very careful about that, "
3764.62,or they ought to be. 
3766.16,"One reason is the existence, or I would say, "
3769.36,the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
3772.99,that are becoming more common in hospitals and elsewhere 
3775.8,and that can cause serious problems. 
3777.54,"But in addition to that, "
3778.47,because of this understanding that the gut microbiome 
3780.98,is influencing and actually creating neurotransmitters 
3784.03,"that can impact mood and mental health, "
3786.01,"impact immune health, and so on. "
3788.18,"As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds "
3789.79,if not thousands of studies emphasizing the key role 
3792.93,"of the microbiome on brain health, "
3795.53,"psychiatric health, et cetera. "
3798.08,I want to just highlight a few of those studies 
3800.61,"and in particular, some recent studies that come from labs "
3803.92,that have been working on this sort of thing 
3805.09,for a very long time. 
3806.65,One of the more exciting studies comes from the work 
3808.9,"of Mauro Costa-Mattioli's lab, "
3811.12,which is at Baylor College of Medicine. 
3813.24,Mauro's lab has been working on mouse models 
3816.2,"of autism spectrum disorder for a long time, "
3819.19,and looking at social behavior 
3821.32,using a mouse model for a long time. 
3823.55,And they've been able to identify 
3826.26,particular types of microbiota 
3829.05,that when they take resonance in the gut 
3832.46,"can help offset some of the symptoms of autism, "
3836.52,at least the symptoms of autism 
3837.87,"that exist in these mouse models, okay? "
3839.52,"So again, this is not human work. "
3841.44,This is work being done on mouse models 
3843.05,for the simple reason that you can do 
3844.9,"these kinds of manipulations, "
3846.07,where basically they took mice 
3847.92,that were in germ free-environments 
3849.33,"or non-germ-free environments, "
3851.61,or they exposed mice to particular microbiota 
3854.01,and not other microbiota 
3855.44,and they discovered that a particular microbiota 
3858.73,"called L. reuteri, "
3859.97,it's L. R-E-U-T-E-R-I. 
3864.09,Treatment with L. reuteri corrects the social deficits 
3868.41,present in these autism models 
3870.2,and it does so by way of activating our old friend 
3873.02,"the vagus nerve, "
3874.34,but not simply because the vagus nerve 
3876.62,"triggers the release of dopamine, "
3878.28,but it turns out that this particular gut microbiota 
3881.14,L. reuteri can correct the social deficits 
3883.67,in this autism spectrum disorder model. 
3885.99,It does that by way of a vagal nerve pathway 
3888.27,that stimulates both dopamine release and oxytocin release. 
3891.02,And they establish this really mechanistically 
3893.0,"by showing, for instance, "
3893.833,"if you get rid of the oxytocin receptor, "
3895.92,you don't see this rescue. 
3897.52,"Now, those are mouse models "
3898.66,"so we have to take those with the appropriate grain of salt, "
3901.75,but they're really exciting. 
3902.81,And they come to us in parallel with other studies 
3906.88,"that are being done, "
3907.8,taking the microbiomes of people 
3911.16,"who have one condition or lack of condition, "
3913.81,and putting it into people who have one condition 
3916.51,or another condition. 
3917.44,Let me explain what I mean by that. 
3920.32,The early discovery of the gut microbiome 
3922.37,and its potential to impact health 
3925.27,was not in the context of the gut-to-brain pathway 
3928.51,but rather it was in the context of colitis. 
3930.83,This dates back to studies in the '
"50s,",
3933.36,whereby people with very severe intractable colitis 
3936.95,for which no other treatment was going to work 
3939.15,received fecal transplants. 
3940.87,"So yes, that's exactly as it sounds. "
3942.75,"Taking the stool of healthy people who do not have colitis, "
3946.17,transplanting those stools into the lower digestive tract 
3949.61,"of people who do have colitis, "
3951.37,"and they saw significant improvement, "
3953.93,if not rescue of the colitis. 
3955.98,That was one of the first indications 
3957.45,"that something within stool, of all things, "
3960.85,"could actually rescue another individual from disease, "
3964.75,"which sounds kind of wild and crazy, "
3967.08,"and may even sound disgusting to some of you, "
3969.41,"but as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode, "
3972.96,almost 
60%,"of stool is live or dead bacteria, "
3977.74,"microbiota, and it really opened up this entire field "
3981.78,of exploring how different microbiota 
3983.818,might have therapeutic effects. 
3986.39,"And indeed, that has been shown to be the case "
3988.93,also in fecal transplants for certain psychiatric illnesses. 
3992.94,These are still ongoing studies. 
3995.31,They vary in quality. 
3997.59,"These are hard studies to do for all sorts of reasons, "
4000.42,"getting the appropriate patient populations, "
4002.17,"getting agreement, et cetera, "
4004.55,making sure that everything's handled properly. 
4006.84,But what this involves is fecal transplants 
4009.39,from individuals that lack 
4011.443,a particular psychiatric condition 
4013.21,or metabolic condition into people 
4015.62,who have a particular metabolic condition 
4018.01,and there has been tremendous success in some cases. 
4020.71,One of the more powerful and salient examples 
4023.64,is for obesity. 
4024.98,There's some people for which even if they ingest 
4026.93,"very low numbers of calories, "
4029.46,"even if they go on a liquid protein diet, "
4031.48,simply can't lose weight. 
4033.72,These are somewhat rare disorders 
4034.96,but these are people that would 
4036.16,either get gastric bypass surgery. 
4038.36,Some people are now getting these fecal transplants 
4040.42,from people that have 
4043.126,"healthy weight and they take the stool from them, "
4048.53,"they put it into lower digestive tract, "
4050.42,and they can see substantial improvement in weight loss 
4054.4,in people that were otherwise unable to do that. 
4056.5,"In some cases, actually they can start eating "
4059.02,relatively normal levels of food and still lose weight. 
4061.29,So pretty remarkable 
4062.29,and that tells us there's something in these microbiota 
4064.5,that's really powerful. 
4065.9,"Now, how those effects are generated isn't clear. "
4069.15,"One idea is that it's impacting the metabolome, "
4073.2,"components of the metabolism, "
4074.62,almost certainly that's going to be the case. 
4076.61,Another idea is that it's impacting neurotransmitters 
4079.41,which change behavior and food choices within the brain. 
4082.49,"Although, as I mentioned, some of these people "
4083.8,are already eating very little food to begin with 
4086.75,so that's a little bit harder of an argument to create. 
4090.74,There are also some somewhat famous examples now 
4093.21,of how fecal transplants can lead to negative outcomes. 
4097.67,But those negative outcomes further underscore 
4099.44,the power of the microbiome in impacting bodily health. 
4104.53,"One key example of this, for instance, "
4106.75,is transfer of fecal matter into another person 
4111.09,in order to treat something like colitis 
4113.26,"and it effectively does that, "
4115.87,"but if the donor of the stool, of the fecal matter "
4120.67,"happened to be obese or have some other metabolic syndrome, "
4123.73,it's been observed that the recipient 
4125.47,can also develop that metabolic syndrome 
4127.94,simply by way of receiving 
4130.37,that donor's particular microbiota. 
4133.32,So these microbiota can create positive outcomes 
4135.86,or they can create negative outcomes. 
4137.99,"Now, most of us of course, are not interested in "
4140.33,or pursuing fecal transplants. 
4141.76,Most people are interested in just creating 
4143.59,a healthy gut microbiome environment 
4145.75,for sake of immune system and brain function. 
4147.6,And we will talk about how to do that in just a few minutes. 
4150.76,But I just want to further underscore 
4153.47,the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry 
4157.98,and in shaping things like mood 
4160.17,or other aspects of mental health 
4161.54,that typically we don't associate with our gut. 
4164.47,"There are several studies published in recent years, "
4166.78,"one that I'll just highlight now, "
4168.24,"first author is Tonya Nguyen, N-G-U-Y-E-N. "
4172.5,The title of the paper is 
4173.567,"""Association of Loneliness and Wisdom "
4176.23,"with Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition, "
4178.87,"an Exploratory Study"". "
4180.35,It's an interesting study. 
4181.57,Looked at 
184,"community dwelling adults, excuse me, "
4186.0,ranging from 
28,to 
97,years old. 
4189.22,They explored whether or not 
4192.16,having enhanced microbial diversity 
4194.63,somehow related to these variables 
4196.81,that they refer to as loneliness and wisdom. 
4198.64,They used a number of different tests to evaluate those. 
4202.18,"Those are common tests in the psychology literature, "
4204.64,"not so much in the biology literature, "
4206.42,"but nonetheless, there are ways of measuring things "
4208.95,"like loneliness and wisdom, "
4212.14,"wisdom in this case, being the opposite of loneliness, "
4216.55,at least in the context of this study. 
4218.08,"And what they found was the more microbial diversity, "
4220.7,"the more diverse one's microbiome was, "
4222.97,the lower incidence of loneliness. 
4225.87,"And they did this by taking fecal samples, "
4228.14,profiling them for RNA. 
4229.53,So essentially doing gene sequencing of the stool 
4231.67,"of these individuals, "
4232.8,"getting ratings of how lonely or not lonely they felt, "
4235.76,and correlating those. 
4237.06,And that's just but one study. 
4238.76,I point it out because it's particularly recent 
4241.22,and it looked like it was particularly well done. 
4243.65,There is another study that I'll just refer you to. 
4245.61,This was a study published in 
2020,"in ""Scientific Reports"". "
4249.27,"The title of the study is ""Emotional Wellbeing "
4251.12,"and Gut Microbiome Profiles by Enterotype"". "
4254.27,What I particularly like about this study 
4255.77,is that they were able to correlate the presence 
4257.8,of certain microbiota with feelings of subjective wellbeing 
4262.65,and lack of or presence of depressive symptoms. 
4266.59,They did high-throughput gene sequencing 
4268.81,of the microbiomes of individuals. 
4270.56,"So that meant measuring the microbiota, "
4273.48,"figuring out which microbiota were present, "
4275.67,how diverse their microbiome was in general. 
4278.09,Gut microbiome diversity is a good thing. 
4280.81,And then to correlate that with what's called 
4283.06,the PANAS score. 
4286.27,PANAS stands for positive affect negative affect schedule. 
4289.92,"This is a test that my lab has used extensively, "
4291.93,that other labs to use to evaluate mood and wellbeing. 
4294.87,"And they defined what were called three enterotypes, "
4298.65,three different categories of people 
4300.13,that ate very different diets 
4302.17,that tended to fall into categories of having more 
4304.85,or fewer emotional symptoms that were negative 
4308.88,or more fewer emotional symptoms that were positive 
4312.09,"and whether or not they tend to be more depressed, anxious, "
4315.3,"or have more stress-related behaviors, et cetera. "
4317.8,And what they were able to derive from this study 
4321.01,was some strong indications about what types of things 
4324.17,"we should ingest in our diet, "
4325.97,"maybe even certain things that we should avoid, "
4327.74,"but certainly the types of things that we should ingest, "
4330.13,that can enhance mood and wellbeing 
4332.45,and can tend to shift people away 
4334.67,from more depressive-like anxiety 
4336.86,and stress-related symptoms. 
4338.28,Before we get into what the particular food items were 
4340.96,"that lend themselves to a healthy microbiome, "
4343.78,"I want to raise a bigger and perhaps more important issue, "
4345.77,which is what is a healthy microbiome. 
4349.82,"I think if you asked any number of world experts, "
4352.11,"and I certainly ask this of Dr. Sonnenburg, "
4353.89,"what is a healthy microbiome, "
4355.49,they're all going to tell you 
4356.43,"it's a microbiome that has a lot of diversity, "
4358.98,that includes a lot of different types of bacteria. 
4361.857,And that makes sense 
4363.14,because it logically would include the bacteria 
4366.49,"that produce GABA and dopamine and serotonin, "
4368.88,"and that support the immune system, "
4370.47,and do a number of different things. 
4371.93,But is it simply the case that adding microbiota diversity 
4376.41,is always a good thing? 
4378.48,"Well, that doesn't seem to be the case. "
4382.23,"Probiotics and prebiotics, "
4384.05,"both of which can enhance microbiotal diversity, "
4387.01,"can improve mood, digestion, immune system, and so on. "
4390.69,That's been established but it's mainly been established 
4392.99,in the context of post-antibiotic treatment 
4395.91,or people that are recovering from illness 
4397.74,or people that have been very stressed 
4400.94,"or have been dealing with all sorts of challenges, "
4404.05,"mental or physical, "
4405.32,and they are an attempt to replenish the gut microbiome. 
4408.95,"However, it's also clear "
4412.31,that excessive microbiota 
4415.47,brought about by excessive intake of probiotics 
4418.72,can lead to things like brain fog. 
4420.28,There's actually some good studies that point to the fact 
4422.85,"that certain metabolites of the microbiome, "
4426.42,certain chemicals produced in the gut 
4428.32,and in the body can actually lead to brain fog states. 
4431.89,This is thought to come about through the lactate pathways 
4435.03,of the gut that can then impact the brain. 
4438.0,If you want to look more into this issue 
4440.13,of whether or not probiotics taken in excess perhaps 
4444.36,"can lead to brain fog, "
4446.55,I'd encourage you to look at a particular paper. 
4448.37,This is a paper published 
4449.33,"in ""Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology"". "
4452.82,And the title of the paper 
4453.653,"is ""Brain Fogginess, Gas, and Bloating, "
4455.61,"a Link Between SIBO Probiotics and Metabolic Acidosis"". "
4459.61,It was published in 
2018.,
4460.81,We can provide a link to this study. 
4462.46,And there are several other studies in the references 
4465.59,"that point to the fact that in some cases, "
4469.93,excessive intake of probiotics and excessive proliferation 
4472.87,of gut microbiota can actually be problematic. 
4476.12,I mention this not to confuse you 
4477.77,but because it is confusing out there. 
4481.13,We all would think that just increasing 
4482.92,microbiotal diversity is always a good thing 
4485.79,but there are thresholds 
4487.98,beyond which excessive microbiotal diversity 
4490.81,might be problematic. 
4492.05,I think everyone agrees that having 
4494.12,too few microbial species living in us is not a good idea. 
4499.48,"Now, none of that answers the questions "
4501.08,"that I think everyone really wants answers to, "
4503.97,"which are, what should we do, "
4506.45,what should we not do to improve our gut microbiome? 
4509.31,"I mean, clearly we can't time travel back "
4511.81,to when we were zero to three years old 
4514.01,"and get a dog if we didn't have a dog, "
4516.78,"get breastfed if we weren't breastfed, "
4518.92,be delivered vaginally as opposed to by C-section 
4521.61,if we didn't have that opportunity. 
4523.3,We just can't time travel and do that. 
4525.32,"All of us, however, should be seeking to improve "
4527.85,the conditions of our gut microbiome 
4529.39,because of the critical ways in which it impacts 
4532.01,the rest of our brain and bodily health. 
4534.71,"So what should we do, what shouldn't we do? "
4536.52,Clearly we know that stress can negatively impact 
4539.06,the gut microbiome. 
4541.11,"However, some forms of stress that can quote unquote "
4544.04,negatively impact the microbiome 
4545.69,"include fasting, long periods of fasts, "
4548.09,which makes sense because a lot of microbiota need food 
4551.63,in order to thrive. 
4552.9,"In fact, many if not all of them do at some point. "
4557.55,There are other questions 
4558.44,such as should we eat particular foods 
4561.01,and how often should we eat those foods? 
4562.99,We've all been told that fiber is incredibly important 
4565.96,"because of the presence of prebiotic fiber, "
4568.73,"which can essentially feed the microbiome, "
4571.68,but is fiber really necessary 
4575.05,and how necessary is it to encourage a healthy microbiome? 
4577.98,"Clearly, there are a number of people "
4579.4,"following relatively low fiber diets, "
4581.65,"such as ketogenic diets, "
4582.93,"and those can have, in some cases, "
4585.31,anti-inflammatory effects and can sometimes 
4588.38,also improve certain microbiota species. 
4591.09,So it can all be rather confusing. 
4592.47,"And for that matter, I asked our resident expert, "
4595.89,"Dr. Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford, "
4598.85,all of these questions. 
4599.82,And he answers them very systematically 
4601.88,in the episode that comes out after this one. 
4605.03,But I don't want to withhold anything from you 
4606.66,so I'll just give a very top contour version 
4609.32,of those answers and then you'll get more in-depth answers 
4612.55,during that episode. 
4614.17,I asked about fasting. 
4615.44,"And the reason I asked about fasting is that years ago, "
4617.86,I was at a meeting as part 
4619.31,of the Pew Biomedical Scholars Meeting 
4622.15,and one of the other Pew Biomedical Scholars 
4625.6,was an expert in gut microbiome 
4627.21,"and I said, ""Hey, are probiotics good for the microbiome? "
4631.58,"And if so, which ones should I take?"" "
4634.23,And his answer was very interesting. 
4635.51,"He said, ""You know, in certain cases they can be, "
4638.5,"especially if you're traveling or you're stressed, "
4641.31,but it turns out that the particular bacteria 
4644.84,that they put in most probiotics 
4646.75,"don't actually replenish the microbiota that you need most."" "
4650.78,"And I thought, ""Oh, well, why don't they make ones "
4652.98,"that replenish the microbiota that you need most?"" "
4655.67,"And his answer was, ""Well, they don't replenish those "
4659.28,but they replenish other ones 
4661.47,that then in turn encourage the development 
4664.39,of the microbiota that you do want 
4666.16,once you start eating the appropriate foods. 
4667.96,So they change the environment 
4669.32,"which makes the environment better, "
4670.52,which indirectly supports the proliferation 
4673.34,"of quote unquote good microbiota."" "
4675.62,"Okay, so that was a somewhat convoluted answer "
4677.52,but I did appreciate his answer. 
4679.02,Then I asked him about fasting. 
4680.73,"I said, ""Well, a lot of people are getting interested "
4682.86,in intermittent fasting now. 
4684.79,People are spending a significant portion 
4686.94,of each 
24-hour,cycle avoiding food 
4688.93,for sake of time restrictive feeding. 
4690.37,What does that do to the gut microbiome? 
4691.83,"Does it make it healthier or does it make it unhealthier?"" "
4694.51,"Well, my colleague from Yale and Dr. Sonnenburg "
4697.95,"both confirmed that during periods of fasting, "
4700.46,"especially prolonged periods of fasting, "
4702.44,we actually start to digest away 
4703.98,much of our digestive tract. 
4706.07,"Now, the whole thing doesn't start to disappear "
4708.04,but there's thinning of the mucosal lining 
4709.91,or the least disruption of the mucosal lining. 
4711.86,A lot of the microbiota species can start to die off. 
4715.37,"And so it was surprising to me, but nonetheless interesting "
4718.97,that fasting may actually cause a disruption 
4722.11,to certain healthy elements of the gut microbiome. 
4726.15,"But again, there's a caveat. "
4727.44,"The caveat is that when people eat after a period of fast, "
4732.1,"there may be a compensatory proliferation, "
4735.12,meaning an increase in healthy gut microbiota. 
4738.28,So you start to get the picture 
4739.45,that fasting is neither good nor bad. 
4742.1,"You start to get the picture that particular diets, "
4744.83,meaning certain restriction diets 
4747.73,or macronutrient-rich diets may not be good or bad 
4750.7,for the microbiome. 
4751.78,And yet there are some answers that arrive to us 
4755.53,"from Dr. Sonnenburg, but from other experts in the field, "
4758.46,that there are certain foods 
4760.97,and certain things that we can ingest 
4762.61,which definitely enhance the microbiome 
4765.5,and make it healthier than it would be 
4767.65,were we to not ingest those foods. 
4770.12,So next I'd like to talk about what I think 
4772.27,is a really pioneering and important study in this area. 
4775.2,This is a study that was carried out by the Sonnenburg lab 
4778.7,"in collaboration with Chris Gardner's lab, also at Stanford, "
4782.32,"where they compared two general types of diets in humans, "
4787.15,"diets that were fiber rich, "
4789.24,which has been proposed time and time again 
4791.49,to enhance microbiota diversity 
4794.34,and to enhance gut-brain signaling even 
4796.5,"and to enhance the immune system perhaps, "
4799.27,and diets that were enriched 
4801.24,in so-called low-sugar fermented foods. 
4804.06,Before I dive into that study and what the conclusions were 
4806.87,because they are very interesting 
4808.01,"and very actionable for all of us, "
4810.12,I do want to touch on probiotics 
4812.36,because I want to avoid confusion. 
4815.91,It is not the case that ingestion of probiotics 
4818.51,will always lead to brain fog. 
4820.2,I want to make that clear. 
4821.97,"It is the case that ingestion of probiotics, "
4824.76,even if those probiotics don't directly contain 
4828.36,"the microbiota species that one is trying to proliferate, "
4831.63,can be useful for improving microbiotal diversity. 
4835.89,"In general, it seems that maintaining "
4838.94,a healthy gut microbiome 
4840.7,"involves ingesting certain types of foods, "
4842.987,"and we'll talk about those in a moment, "
4845.56,but perhaps also augmenting the microbiota system 
4850.09,through prebiotics or probiotics at a fairly low level 
4853.71,on a consistent basis. 
4854.86,So these are not high dose probiotics 
4856.55,except under conditions of dysbiosis 
4860.32,"where, for instance, if somebody has done "
4862.06,a round of antibiotics and they need to replenish 
4865.54,"their gut microbiome, "
4867.09,there are foods and there are pill form 
4869.41,and powder form prebiotics and probiotics 
4871.98,that can be very useful. 
4874.19,Or in cases where people have been very stressed 
4877.05,or are undergoing excessive travel 
4879.56,"or have shifted their diet radically, "
4882.58,"maybe that's due to travel, "
4883.64,"maybe that's due to illness, "
4884.59,maybe that's due to stress. 
4886.06,But when there are a number of different converging events 
4888.63,"that are stressing or depleting microbiotal diversity, "
4893.63,that's when at least I believe it can be useful 
4896.29,to support the gut microbiome 
4897.96,through the ingestion of quality probiotics or prebiotics. 
4902.01,So it would be under conditions where people are stressed 
4905.39,or their system is generally stressed 
4907.78,for environmental or illness-related reasons 
4910.73,that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses 
4914.08,of prebiotics or probiotics than one might normally use 
4917.82,"but that under normal conditions, "
4919.73,that one would focus on quality nutrients 
4923.24,through diet and focus on ingestion of probiotics 
4928.49,"at a fairly low to moderate level, "
4931.3,and/or prebiotics at a fairly low to moderate level. 
4935.05,That just seems like the logical approach 
4936.77,based on the experts that I've spoken to. 
4939.0,But certainly if your doctor prescribes 
4942.18,or suggests that you take high levels of probiotics 
4944.61,"for any reason, "
4945.64,"you should definitely pay attention to your physician, "
4947.22,and you should obviously pay attention to your physician 
4949.25,in any a case. 
4950.24,You should never add or remove anything 
4952.41,from your nutritional plan or supplementation plan 
4955.01,without consulting a physician. 
4957.15,So what should we do in order to maximize the health 
4959.55,of our gut-brain axis as it's called? 
4962.16,How should we support the diversity of the good microbiota 
4965.93,that help us create all these neurotransmitters 
4967.86,"that we want, improve our immune system function, "
4972.06,and so on and so forth? 
4973.91,"Well, some of that is going to be through the basics. "
4977.74,"When I say the basics, "
4978.62,I mean the foundational things that really set us up 
4981.36,for overall health. 
4982.27,So this is going to be getting deep sleep 
4985.28,of sufficient duration 
80,plus percent of the time. 
4989.64,"I mean, if you could get a hundred percent of the time, "
4990.95,that'd be great but very few people accomplish that. 
4992.98,It's going to be proper hydration. 
4994.25,It's going to be proper social interactions. 
4996.15,It's going to be proper nutrition. 
4997.73,And we'll talk more about nutrition in a moment. 
4999.26,It's going to be limiting 
5000.67,"excessive, prolonged stressors or stress. "
5004.24,"And indeed we've done episodes about, "
5006.28,just about all of those things 
5007.61,but certainly about stress 
5009.03,we have an episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast 
5011.01,that you can find at hubermanlab.com 
5012.56,"all about mastering stress, "
5013.85,"how to avoid long periods of intense stress, "
5017.21,what to do to offset those. 
5020.17,"Given that stress can disrupt the microbiome, "
5023.45,"whether or not you're fasting or not, "
5025.97,those tools ought to be useful. 
5028.49,"Now, in what I consider to be a landmark study "
5031.36,"exploring the relationship between the gut microbiome, "
5034.23,"food intake, and overall health is this paper "
5038.06,"from Justin Sonnenburg's lab and Chris Gardner's lab, "
5041.59,both of which are at Stanford. 
5043.65,"And the paper entitled ""Gut Microbiome-Targeted Diets "
5046.53,"Modulate Human Immune Status"" "
5048.12,"was published in the journal ""Cell"", "
5049.57,"which is among the three top journals perhaps in the world, "
5052.807,"""Nature"", ""Science"", and ""Cell"" "
5053.87,"really being the apex journals for overall science, "
5058.7,and especially for biomedical sciences. 
5061.16,"Now, this is a very interesting study. "
5063.45,It was done on humans. There were two major groups. 
5066.0,One group of humans was instructed to increase 
5069.1,the amount of fiber in their diet 
5070.86,and in fact ate a high fiber diet. 
5073.41,The other group was instructed to eat 
5075.63,a high fermented food diet. 
5078.69,"Now, both groups started off not having eaten "
5082.57,a lot of fiber or a lot of fermented foods 
5085.13,and were told to increase the amount of either fiber 
5087.83,or fermented foods that they were ingesting 
5089.75,over a four-week ramp up period 
5091.63,and that was to avoid any major gastric distress. 
5094.69,It turns out that if you're not already accustomed 
5096.75,"to eating a lot of fiber, "
5097.79,increasing your amount of fiber dramatically 
5100.19,can cause some gastric distress 
5102.05,"but if you ease into it over time, as we'll see, "
5104.68,"there's a mechanism behind this, "
5105.91,"which was unveiled in this study, "
5108.07,"but if you ease into it over time, "
5109.66,then the system can tolerate it. 
5111.6,Likewise high fermented foods 
5114.34,can be readily tolerated 
5116.18,if there's a ramp up phase of ingesting 
5118.68,"maybe one serving a day, "
5119.81,"then maybe two servings, and ramping up in this case "
5123.22,as high as six servings per day. 
5126.63,"However, after this ramp up period, "
5129.97,the group assigned to the high fiber condition 
5132.09,maintained high fiber intake for six weeks 
5134.94,and the high fermented food group maintained 
5137.33,high fermented food intake for six weeks 
5140.41,after which they went off 
5142.82,either the high fiber or the high fermented food diet 
5145.62,and there was a four-week follow up period 
5147.71,during which they gradually returned to baseline. 
5150.47,Throughout the study their gut microbiome was evaluated 
5153.65,for the diversity of gut microbiota. 
5156.24,And there were also a number of measures 
5158.17,"of immune system function, "
5159.84,in particular measures of the so-called inflammatome. 
5163.23,The immune system has a lot of different molecules involved. 
5165.55,I did a whole episode about the immune system 
5167.23,if you're interested in learning 
5168.26,"what some of those molecules are, "
5169.87,various cytokines and signaling molecules 
5172.0,that reflect either high inflammation states 
5174.83,or reduced inflammation states in the brain and body. 
5177.42,You're welcome to check that episode. 
5179.13,It's also at hubermanlab.com. 
5181.66,"Regardless, in this study, "
5184.04,they explored the sorts of immune markers 
5187.44,that were expressed in either of the two groups 
5189.63,and compared those. 
5190.9,The basic takeaway of this paper 
5192.83,"was that contrary to what they predicted, "
5197.23,the high fiber diet did not lead 
5199.16,"to increased microbiota diversity, "
5201.47,at least not in all cases. 
5203.05,And that was somewhat surprising. 
5205.55,"You know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber "
5208.18,and a lot of the material in fruits and vegetables 
5210.76,and grains and so forth 
5212.96,are supposed to support microbiotal diversity 
5216.42,and the proliferation of existing microbiota. 
5219.38,"And that is not what they observed, "
5221.68,although I want to be very clear in pointing out 
5223.64,that the results do not indicate that fiber 
5226.84,"is not useful for health overall, "
5230.09,but it does point to the fact that increasing fiber intake 
5233.07,"did not increase microbiota diversity, "
5235.15,"which in general, as I mentioned before, "
5237.6,"is associated with improvements in microbiota function, "
5241.97,"health, and overall wellbeing. "
5244.93,"Now, the high fermented food diet condition "
5247.0,was very interesting. 
5248.49,It resulted in increased microbiome diversity 
5251.57,and decrease inflammatory signals and activity. 
5255.07,So there was a twofer. 
5256.59,Basically by ingesting high fermented foods 
5260.108,"in fair abundance, right? "
5261.62,"You know, four to six servings or more per day "
5263.65,is a lot of fermented food intake. 
5266.14,We'll talk about what some of those foods were. 
5268.16,But the outcome was very positive. 
5270.39,There was a clear increase in microbiome diversity 
5273.58,and decreased inflammatory signals. 
5276.07,So things like interleukin-
"6,",
5278.8,a number of other interleukins and cytokines 
5280.75,that are associated with increased inflammation 
5283.55,in the brain and body were reduced significantly. 
5286.45,"Now, let's talk a little bit about this notion "
5288.92,"of number of servings, et cetera. "
5290.95,"One somewhat minor point of the study, "
5294.01,but I think is useful in terms 
5295.18,of taking an actionable stance with this 
5298.03,is that the number of servings of fermented foods 
5301.28,was not as strong a predictor of improvements 
5305.44,"in the inflammatome, meaning reduced inflammation "
5308.33,"and improvements in microbiota diversity, "
5311.0,as was the duration of time that the individuals 
5314.79,were ingesting fermented foods. 
5316.63,"In other words, the longer that one "
5318.02,"is consistently ingesting fermented foods on a daily basis, "
5321.25,the better the outcomes in terms of the gut microbiome 
5324.19,and for reducing inflammation. 
5326.36,So I think that's an important point. 
5328.37,"And I make that point, "
5329.7,"especially because for a lot of people, "
5332.05,"even if you do this ramp up phase, "
5333.38,six servings per day of fermented foods 
5335.68,can seem like quite a lot. 
5337.38,So what are these fermented foods? 
5339.95,I think many of us are familiar with certain cheeses 
5343.48,and being fermented and beer being fermented 
5345.82,and kombucha is fermented. 
5347.61,"In this study, they focus specifically "
5349.32,on low-sugar fermented foods. 
5351.59,"So this would be plain yogurt, "
5354.68,"in some cases, kimchi or sauerkraut. "
5357.89,"An important consideration, however, "
5359.57,is that it needs to contain 
5361.4,"what are called live active cultures, "
5363.17,which means there actually have to be microbiota 
5366.5,that are alive inside the sauerkraut. 
5368.51,One way you know whether or not that's happening 
5370.28,is if you purchase sauerkraut or pickles or kimchi 
5374.49,from a jar or a container 
5375.97,that's on the non-refrigerated shelf 
5378.98,"or the non-refrigerated section of your grocery store, "
5381.6,it is not going to contain 
5383.43,live active cultures of microbiota. 
5386.49,"And likewise, if you consume yogurt "
5389.47,"that has a lot of sugar or other components added to it, "
5393.13,it's not going to have the same positive effect 
5395.41,"on the microbiome, "
5396.49,at least that's the prediction 
5397.98,given some of the relationship 
5399.19,between the sorts of microbiota that live in sugar 
5402.02,versus plain type yogurts. 
5404.21,They gave people the option of consuming 
5406.03,any number of different low-sugar fermented food. 
5408.81,"So that again that could be sauerkraut, kimchi, "
5410.97,"things like kefir, natto. "
5413.95,"In Japan, they consume natto which is a fermented food. "
5417.81,Beer was not one of the fermented foods 
5420.383,that was included in the fermented food list. 
5422.88,"And when we say six servings per day, "
5425.15,"that is indeed six, six ounce servings, "
5429.1,"or six, four to six ounce servings. "
5431.62,It was not six servings of what's listed on the package. 
5434.86,"So again, that turns out to be a fair amount "
5437.59,of fermented foods. 
5438.423,How should you gauge 
5439.256,whether or not you're getting enough of this? 
5440.18,"Well, if you decide to take on this protocol "
5443.41,"of ingesting more fermented foods, "
5444.91,which at least by my read of this study 
5447.19,"and some of the follow up work that's being done, "
5449.22,sounds like a terrific idea 
5450.93,if you want to improve your gut microbiome 
5452.82,"for all the great reasons that one would want to, "
5455.58,"brain-body health, reduced inflammation, and on and on, "
5459.54,well then you definitely want to focus 
5461.74,on fermented foods that you enjoy consuming. 
5464.46,"So for you if that's kefir, "
5466.22,"or for you that's plain yogurt, "
5467.83,"or for you that's sauerkraut, "
5469.23,"which happens to be my personal favorite, "
5472.11,then you want to make sure that it's going to be something 
5474.7,that you are going to enjoy ingesting quite a lot of 
5477.81,and that you're going to be okay with ingesting 
5480.42,probably throughout the day. 
5481.9,"Now, people follow different meal schedules, of course, "
5484.01,but this does require not just eating 
5486.13,all the fermented foods just before bedtime or at one meal. 
5490.02,"I suppose you could do that, "
5491.57,"but in general, it's going to work best in terms "
5493.67,of limiting gastric distress 
5495.36,by spreading it out throughout the day. 
5497.53,I also want to mention brine. 
5499.06,Brine is the liquid that surrounds sauerkraut. 
5503.65,It's that very salty fluid. 
5506.87,And that contains a lot of active live cultures. 
5509.75,And they did include or they allowed people to include 
5513.41,brine in this study. 
5515.8,"And in discussions with Dr. Sonnenburg, "
5517.91,which we'll go into in more detail on the episode 
5521.02,"that comes out next week, "
5522.21,we talk a lot about the particular value 
5524.19,that brine might hold 
5525.4,in terms of bringing about microbiota diversity 
5528.57,because of the richness of live cultures that it contains. 
5532.06,I do want to focus for a moment on the high fiber condition 
5534.54,because there were some interesting observations 
5536.21,about the people that were placed into that condition. 
5538.81,"First of all, increasing the amount of fiber "
5543.17,definitely increased the number of enzymes 
5546.99,that can be used to digest fiber. 
5549.84,This is in keeping with this idea of this ramp up phase 
5552.88,where accumulation of more fiber intake 
5555.12,can over time lead to less gastric distress 
5557.68,but also to more utilization of fiber 
5559.59,which overall should be a good thing. 
5561.33,So while they didn't observe an increase 
5563.83,in immune system function 
5565.56,"or an increase in microbiota diversity, "
5567.72,there was an increase in these fiber digesting enzymes. 
5571.61,They also observed what they called 
5573.09,personalized immune responses. 
5575.2,There were some subgroups within the high fiber group 
5578.03,that had interesting changes in terms 
5580.76,"of their reactions to, or I should say their inflammatome, "
5585.12,"meaning the inflammatory markers they expressed, "
5586.9,as well as their microbiota diversity. 
5589.71,So there were essentially three groups. 
5591.1,One group actually showed an increase 
5592.97,in inflammatory markers. 
5594.62,So that was quite surprising 
5595.87,and probably not wonderful for the message 
5599.62,that fiber is always good for us 
5601.2,but that was a small cohort within the fiber intake group. 
5605.84,"Another group and still another group, "
5608.71,both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity 
5611.92,although to varying degrees. 
5614.32,So I don't want to paint the picture that fiber is bad 
5616.71,but fiber certainly did not have the positive effects 
5619.12,on microbiota diversity 
5620.83,that the high fermented food diet did. 
5623.22,"So my read of this study, "
5624.38,and I think the stance that many others have taken 
5627.0,"as a consequence of these data, "
5629.58,"is that we should be increasing our fermented food intake, "
5632.6,that that's simply a good thing to do in order to support 
5635.55,our gut microbiome and to reduce inflammatory signals 
5638.7,in our brain and body. 
5640.6,And there are a number of different ways to do that. 
5642.53,I mentioned some of the particular foods. 
5644.27,"However, anytime you're talking "
5645.38,"about ingesting fermented foods, "
5647.46,especially the high quality ones 
5649.38,that come from the refrigerated section 
5650.96,"of the grocery store, "
5653.56,"and that have low sugar content, et cetera, "
5656.47,we do have to be considerate of cost 
5658.4,"because certain things like kombuchas, for instance, "
5660.44,can be quite costly. 
5662.55,I should also mention some kombuchas 
5663.84,"actually contain alcohol, some do not, "
5666.73,or contain very little amounts of alcohol. 
5670.1,One way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods 
5672.84,while still being able to accumulate 
5674.6,a lot of fermented food intake 
5675.95,is to simply make those fermented foods yourself. 
5678.24,And this is something that we've started exploring 
5680.55,and experimenting with in our home. 
5682.85,One simple way to do this 
5683.85,is to just make your own sauerkraut. 
5685.63,It involves very few ingredients. 
5687.02,"It basically involves cabbage, water, and salt, "
5690.03,but there's a specific process that you need to follow 
5692.15,in order to create these large volumes of sauerkraut at home 
5696.23,using that low cost method. 
5698.38,The best resource that I know of 
5700.61,in order to follow a great recipe 
5703.12,to make homemade sauerkraut would be the recipe 
5706.16,for homemade sauerkraut that's contained 
5707.78,"in Tim Ferriss's book, ""The "
4-Hour,"Chef"". "
5709.85,There's an excellent protocol there. 
5711.58,"It involves chopping up the cabbage, putting into a bowl, "
5713.9,"mashing it up with your hands, "
5716.53,"which can be fun, "
5718.0,"putting water in there, some salt, covering it, "
5719.97,"and then keeping it in a particular environment, "
5722.01,and then routinely scraping off 
5723.85,some of the material from the surface. 
5725.53,You have to do that in order to make sure 
5727.81,that you're not getting microbes and things 
5731.78,growing in it that are bad for you. 
5733.17,So you definitely want to pay careful attention 
5734.82,"to the protocol, but that's a very, very low cost way "
5737.63,of generating lots and lots of fermented foods 
5740.05,so you don't go broke trying to improve your microbiome. 
5743.13,The other thing that you can do 
5744.09,if you're really obsessed with kombucha 
5746.53,"or something like that, to avoid the high cost of kombucha "
5748.84,"is there are ways that you can get the scoby, "
5751.07,which basically allows you to make 
5752.3,your own kombucha at home. 
5753.38,"I've never tried this, but when I was a post doc, "
5755.85,"there was an undergraduate in the lab, "
5757.24,"I think, well, I won't out him, "
5759.77,but he's now gone on to medical school 
5762.31,and I think he's passed his residency 
5764.5,"and is a practicing doctor, "
5766.36,"but nonetheless, he was always making kombucha at home. "
5768.8,"He told me it was exceedingly easy, but then again, "
5770.9,he had a number of other skills and attributes 
5772.66,that made me think that he could do 
5774.56,"pretty much anything with ease, "
5775.89,whereas I tend to struggle with even basic cooking. 
5778.47,"So maybe if you're feeling a little more adventurous, "
5780.79,you could explore making your own kombucha. 
5783.36,But there are a number of different protocols and recipes 
5785.34,out there for making your own low-sugar fermented foods. 
5788.4,So you needn't run out and buy fresh sauerkraut 
5791.46,all the time. 
5792.293,I should also mention for those of you that are interested 
5794.53,"in getting your fermented intake from pickles, "
5798.7,jarred pickles rarely if ever contain ferment. 
5802.7,"Mostly they're just soaked in vinegar, water, "
5805.22,"and with some spices, "
5806.1,but there are some that contain ferment. 
5808.18,You actually have to look for that on the container. 
5810.73,"And I don't know, maybe someone out there "
5811.93,knows how to make natto and knows how to make kimchi well 
5814.7,and things of that sort. 
5816.22,It certainly is the case based on the data from the study 
5819.15,that ingesting more servings of fermented food per day 
5822.24,ought to be beneficial for our gut microbiome. 
5824.29,And since this is an episode not just about gut microbiome 
5826.73,"but gut-brain health, "
5828.52,I should mention that one form of signaling 
5831.02,between the gut microbiome and the brain 
5832.73,which we did not discuss 
5834.05,and I'll just touch on briefly 
5836.02,is that when the inflammatome or the genes and markers 
5841.03,"of inflammation are kept in a healthy range, "
5845.26,there's an active signaling of that immune system status 
5848.77,to the brain. 
5849.603,There's an intermediate cell type that communicates 
5852.62,immune status to the brain. 
5854.34,And that cell type is the microglial cell. 
5856.29,It's a type of glia as the name suggests. 
5858.73,"When there's a lot of inflammation in the body, "
5861.54,these microglia actually get activated 
5863.81,and can start eating away at various components 
5867.23,of the brain and nervous system. 
5868.47,And I don't mean massive eating away. 
5869.79,They're not going to digest the whole brain 
5871.28,but these microglia are sort of the resident macrophages 
5875.26,of the brain. 
5876.093,Macrophages are in the periphery and they gobble up debris 
5878.73,and things of that sort. 
5879.84,The microglia on a regular basis are eating up debris 
5883.42,that accumulates across waking cycles 
5885.88,and in response to micro-damage to the brain 
5888.2,that occurs on a daily basis. 
5889.48,So they have a lot of important basic everyday 
5891.85,what we call housekeeping functions. 
5893.76,"But when there's a lot of inflammation in the body, "
5895.96,"when there's a massive immune response, "
5898.73,the microglia can be hyperactivated 
5900.85,and that's thought to lead to any number 
5902.47,"of different cognitive defects or challenges thinking, "
5905.73,"or maybe even some forms of neurodegeneration over time, "
5909.22,although that last point is more of a hypothesis 
5911.48,than a well tamped down fact at this point. 
5914.1,There's still a lot of investigation to be done in humans. 
5916.73,"The animal data, however, are very, very strong "
5919.6,that when the immune system is activated 
5921.53,or chronically activated or hyperactivated 
5924.17,"that neural tissue, meaning brain tissue "
5925.86,and other central nervous system tissue can suffer. 
5928.02,So there are a lot of reasons to want 
5930.22,"to not just improve microbiome diversity, "
5933.23,but to also improve immune system function 
5936.2,and to limit the number of inflammatory markers 
5938.84,that are present in the body 
5940.16,because of the way those inflammatory markers 
5942.36,can signal deleterious events in the brain. 
5945.38,And while eating fermented foods 
5947.89,and making your own fermented foods 
5949.88,and buying high quality fermented foods 
5951.91,"might seem like an inconvenience, "
5953.79,I would say that from the perspective 
5956.26,"of cost-benefit or effort-benefit, "
5958.8,it's actually quite a good situation 
5961.08,where if you can just ramp up the number of fermented foods 
5964.23,or servings of fermented foods that you're eating per day 
5966.41,over a period of a few weeks 
5967.73,"so that you're tolerating that well, "
5970.25,that ought to have a very positive effect 
5972.27,on your microbiome diversity 
5974.23,and indeed on gut-brain function. 
5976.76,And I'll be the last to suggest 
5978.15,that people completely forego on fiber. 
5980.54,I think there's some debate out there 
5981.89,as to how much fiber we need and whether or not 
5984.95,certain forms of fiber are better than others. 
5987.29,I'm not going to get into that debate. 
5988.66,It's barbed wire enough without me injecting my own views 
5991.69,into that debate. 
5992.8,But I think there's ample evidence to support the fact 
5995.1,that for most people ingesting a fair amount of fiber 
5998.7,is going to be a good idea. 
6000.41,I would just say that 
6001.243,make sure that you're also ingesting a fair amount 
6002.94,of fermented foods. 
6004.2,"And along the lines of fiber, "
6006.14,"in an accompanying article published in ""Cell"", "
6008.71,which was sort of a what we call a news and views piece 
6011.71,"about the Sonnenburg and Gardner paper, "
6015.35,"they make a quite good point, "
6016.92,which is that the increase in fiber intake 
6019.65,"that led to the increase in carbohydrate active enzymes, "
6023.15,"these CAZymes as they're called, "
6025.57,"these are enzymes that help digest fiber, "
6028.3,"quote, ""indicating an enhanced capacity for the microbiome "
6031.86,"to degrade complex carbohydrates present in fibrous foods"". "
6035.43,"So in other words, eating more fiber and fibrous foods "
6040.92,allowed for an increase in these enzymes 
6042.56,that allow you to eat still more fibrous foods 
6044.88,or to better digest fibrous foods that are coming in 
6047.68,through other sources. 
6048.8,So there is at least one utility for increasing fiber 
6052.61,even though it's separate from the gut microbiotal diversity 
6055.59,and reducing inflammation. 
6057.43,And I'd be remiss if I didn't touch on some of the data 
6059.87,and controversy about artificial sweeteners 
6062.49,and the gut microbiome. 
6064.47,I want to be very clear that what I'm about to tell you 
6066.83,"has only been established in animal models, "
6069.3,"in a mouse model, at least to my knowledge. "
6071.82,"What the studies have shown, and there were several, "
6074.59,"but one published in the journal ""Nature"" "
6076.12,a few years back is the one 
6077.1,that got the most amount of attention 
6078.73,is that animals that consume large amounts 
6080.77,of artificial sweeteners. 
6082.25,in particular things like saccharin or sucralose 
6085.06,show disruptions in their gut microbiome. 
6087.67,I'm not aware of any studies in humans 
6089.41,that show the equivalent effect. 
6090.73,And I'm not aware of any studies in humans that show 
6093.33,the equivalent effect for things 
6095.62,"like plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners, "
6097.84,"things like Stevia, monk fruit, and things of that sort. "
6101.09,"And at least by my exploration, "
6103.42,I couldn't find any data specifically 
6105.09,related to the sweetener aspartame. 
6107.79,So right now it's somewhat controversial 
6110.38,and actually this is kind of a third rail topic out there. 
6112.88,When one group will come out saying 
6114.82,that artificial sweeteners are bad 
6116.1,"because they disrupt the gut microbiome, "
6118.11,"the response generally from a number of people as well, "
6121.4,that's only been shown in animal models. 
6122.9,And indeed that's true. 
6124.31,So right now I don't think that there's a strong case 
6126.84,one way or the other. 
6128.13,I think that people should basically ask themselves 
6130.26,"whether or not they like artificial sweeteners or not, "
6133.13,"whether or not they're willing to risk it or not, "
6135.57,and obviously that's an individual choice. 
6138.11,I also want to point out a recent study 
6140.68,"from Diego Bohorquez's lab, "
6143.02,"which actually shows, however, that neurons in the gut, "
6146.88,"those neuropod cells, are actually capable of distinguishing "
6150.73,between real sugars and artificial sweeteners. 
6153.83,This is a really interesting body of work. 
6156.27,"It was published just now, just recently, "
6158.88,"I should say, February "
2022.,
6160.64,The title of the paper is 
6161.757,"""The Preference for Sugar over Sweetener Depends "
6164.15,"on a Gut Sensor Cell"". "
6165.66,"And to make a long story short, "
6167.2,what they showed was there's a category of neuropod cells 
6170.36,that recognize sugar in the gut and signal that information 
6175.07,about the presence of sugar in the gut to the brain 
6178.07,"via the pathways we talked about before, "
6179.86,"the nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine, "
6181.66,"et cetera, et cetera. "
6183.61,"Interestingly, the very same category of neurons "
6186.81,can respond to artificial sweeteners 
6190.27,"and signal that information to the brain, "
6192.14,but the pattern of signaling 
6194.76,and indeed the signature pattern 
6197.67,that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain 
6200.68,is actually quite a bit different 
6202.76,when these same neurons are responding 
6205.83,to artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. 
6209.73,And this is very interesting because what it means 
6211.277,is first of all that neurons 
6214.5,have incredible specificity 
6216.18,in terms of what they are signaling from the gut 
6218.3,to the brain. 
6219.48,And it also means that there may be a particular signal 
6222.9,that the brain receives that says 
6224.53,I'm receiving some intake of food or drink 
6228.48,that tastes sweet but doesn't actually offer much nutrients 
6232.84,"in the direction of sweetness, "
6234.01,meaning that it doesn't have calories despite being sweet. 
6236.74,"Now, again, this is all subconscious processing. "
6239.09,And like with the previous studies 
6240.9,we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners 
6243.48,"generally and the gut microbiome generally, "
6245.64,it's unclear how this relates to humans 
6248.97,at this point in time. 
6250.22,But given the similarity of cellular processes 
6252.69,"and molecular processes at the level of gut-brain in mice, "
6255.89,I think it stands to reason that these neuropod cells 
6258.43,very likely are capable of signaling sweet presence 
6261.91,of real sweetener versus artificial sweetener 
6263.74,"in humans as well, "
6264.96,although that still remains to be determined empirically. 
6267.66,So I'd like to just briefly recap what I've covered today. 
6270.68,I started off by talking about the structure and function 
6273.38,of the gut-brain axis. 
6275.11,I described the basic structure and function 
6277.58,"of the digestive pathway, "
6279.55,"and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, "
6282.86,"meaning many, many little bacteria that can signal "
6286.92,all sorts of things to the rest of the brain and body. 
6289.9,"And indeed, we talked about the various ways they do that. "
6292.5,"We talked about direct pathways, "
6294.5,literally nerve networks that extend from the gut 
6297.43,up to the brain and from the brain back to the gut. 
6300.43,"And we talked about indirect pathways, "
6302.92,how some of the gut microbiota can actually synthesize 
6306.11,"neurotransmitters that get out into the bloodstream, "
6308.53,"can impact the body, "
6309.65,"can impact the immune system, "
6311.47,and can get into the brain and act as neurotransmitters 
6314.81,in the brain just as would neurotransmitters 
6317.47,that originate from within the brain. 
6320.921,We also talked about what constitutes 
6322.74,a healthy versus unhealthy microbiome. 
6325.4,And it's very clear that having a diverse microbiome 
6328.44,is healthier than having a non-diverse microbiome. 
6332.84,"But as I pointed out, "
6334.66,there's still a lot of questions as to exactly 
6336.67,what microbiota species you want to enhance 
6338.9,and which ones you want to suppress in the gut 
6341.33,in order to achieve the best gut-brain axis function. 
6345.35,We talked about how things like fasting might impact 
6347.75,the microbiome and how some of that might be 
6349.81,a little bit counterintuitive 
6351.21,"based on some of the other positive effects of fasting, "
6353.981,"or if we're not just discussing fasting, "
6356.21,some other types of somewhat restrictive diets 
6358.87,either restrictive in time or restrictive 
6360.75,"in terms of macronutrient intake, "
6362.95,how those may or may not improve the health 
6365.57,of gut microbiome. 
6366.63,And the basic takeaway was that because we don't know 
6369.58,"exactly how specific diets impact the gut microbiome, "
6373.07,and we don't know how fasting 
6375.09,"either promotes or degrades the microbiome, "
6377.86,we really can't say whether or not they are improving 
6380.5,or degrading the microbiome at this time. 
6382.96,"However, it is clear that stress, "
6385.91,"in particular chronic stress, "
6387.14,can disrupt the gut microbiome. 
6388.83,"It's also clear, of course, "
6389.81,that antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome. 
6392.47,And that brings us to the topic 
6393.78,of prebiotics and probiotics. 
6395.82,"And I emphasized the fact that for most people, "
6398.42,ingesting high quality non-processed foods 
6402.03,that includes some prebiotic fiber 
6404.72,but also that includes some probiotics 
6407.39,will probably be healthy 
6408.62,but not excessive levels of probiotics. 
6410.9,High levels of supplemented probiotics 
6412.86,of the sort that would come in a probiotic pill 
6414.57,or even prescription probiotics 
6416.54,would probably lend themselves best to when people 
6418.92,were under severe chronic stress 
6421.06,or had just come off a serious round 
6423.3,or an ongoing or repeated rounds of antibiotics. 
6426.78,That does not mean that ingesting probiotics 
6429.43,in any form or any kind is not good. 
6431.55,"It just means that the very high dose probiotics, "
6434.99,"again, typically found in prescription form "
6436.98,or capsule pill form probably are best reserved 
6440.15,to cases where of course your doctor prescribes them. 
6442.86,You should always follow your doctor's advice. 
6444.76,"But in cases where perhaps you are jetlagged, "
6447.3,"you're traveling excessively for any reason, "
6449.8,"or working excessively, "
6450.83,"you're not getting enough sleep, "
6452.28,or your diet is radically changed from normal. 
6455.24,And we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber 
6458.26,in your diet might be useful for increasing 
6461.56,fiber digesting enzymes and the assimilation 
6464.03,of fibrous foods 
6465.28,but that it's really the ingestion of fermented foods 
6468.03,"and, in fact, getting anywhere from four "
6470.07,or even up to six servings a day of fermented foods 
6472.45,can be immensely beneficial for reducing 
6475.1,inflammatory markers in the body 
6476.71,and for improving microbiota diversity 
6479.87,all along the gut and thereby improving signaling 
6483.75,and outcomes along the gut-brain axis. 
6487.66,So we went all the way from structure to function 
6491.06,"to the four kinds of signaling, "
6492.53,"mechanical, chemical, indirect, direct, "
6494.78,"probiotics, fiber, and fermented foods. "
6497.73,And I tossed in a little bit at the end there also 
6500.32,about ways that you can make your own fermented foods 
6503.45,at home in order to try and offset some of the costs. 
6505.72,"Also, it's just kind of fun to do. "
6507.35,And some of those actually taste quite good. 
6509.59,I've actually found that the fermented sauerkraut 
6512.59,that we're making at home actually rivals 
6514.97,the sauerkraut that you can buy 
6516.2,out of the refrigerated section at the grocery store. 
6519.32,And I am by no means a skilled cook or chef 
6523.0,and basically have no culinary skill whatsoever. 
6525.62,"So if I can do it, you can do it. "
6527.16,I hope you found this information useful 
6529.08,and perhaps also actionable. 
6531.8,One of my motivations for doing this episode 
6534.41,"was, again, as a primer for the episode "
6536.87,with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg 
6538.53,"where we go really deep into the gut microbiome, "
6540.8,"less so into the gut-brain axis, "
6542.61,"but really deep into the gut microbiome, "
6544.51,"what it is, what it does, what it doesn't do, "
6546.61,and some of the emerging findings from his lab 
6548.59,that are yet to be published. 
6550.27,And I also was excited to do this episode 
6552.47,because I think many of us have heard 
6554.44,about the gut microbiome. 
6555.67,We hear about these bacteria that live in our gut. 
6557.9,We hear about the gut-brain axis 
6559.61,or that 
90%,or more of the serotonin that we make 
6562.77,is made in our gut. 
6563.81,We hear about the gut as a second brain and so forth. 
6566.49,"But I think for many people, "
6568.89,they don't really have a clear picture 
6570.71,of what the gut microbiome is 
6572.43,and the pathways and mechanisms by which it can signal 
6575.58,to the brain and to the other parts of the body. 
6577.92,So I hope that today's information at least improved 
6580.61,the clarity around that topic 
6582.64,and leaves you with a more vivid picture 
6584.64,of this incredible system that is our gut-brain axis.

6632.13,"While supplements aren't necessary for everybody, "
6634.33,many people derive tremendous benefit from them. 
6636.75,"One of the key issues with supplements, however, "
6638.79,is that the quality of supplements can vary tremendously 
6641.95,"and oftentimes that relates to the precision, "
6645.15,"or I should say the lack of precision, "
6646.69,with which companies put different amounts of supplements 
6650.28,in the capsules and tablets that are listed on the bottle. 
6653.09,"For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, "
