0.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the,"Huberman Lab podcast,"
2.25,where we discuss science
and,science-based tools
4.92,for everyday life.
5.7,[MUSIC PLAYING]
9.07,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
and,I'm a professor
10.93,of neurobiology
and,ophthalmology
12.94,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.41,Today we are
discussing,fertility.
16.57,We will discuss male fertility
and,female fertility.
19.97,And I should mention that
today's,discussion is not just
23.14,for people who are seeking
to,conceive children
25.45,or who want to know how their
children,"were conceived,"
27.79,but it's really for everybody.
29.47,And I say that because it
is,the story of all of us.
32.95,All of us are here
because,a specialized set
35.8,"of cells, called germ cells--"
38.2,that is the sperm and the egg.
39.853,And I'll make it very
clear,why they're called
41.77,germ cells a little bit later.
43.02,It has nothing to
do,with infection.
44.62,But it's because a sperm cell
and,an egg cell arrived at one
50.29,"another, either in vivo-- inside"
of,our mother-- or in vitro--
54.138,so-called in vitro
fertilization--,and then
55.93,we're implanted into our
mother,and became us.
59.59,And so understanding
the,process of how
62.8,the egg cell and the
sperm,cell came to be
66.13,is really the key
to,understanding
67.93,how that fertilization
process,came to be.
70.263,"Now, I know"
everyone's,"thinking, I"
71.68,know how fertilization occurs.
73.202,It occurs through sexual
intercourse,and so on.
75.16,And we'll talk a
little,bit about that.
77.05,But I promise you
that,if you understand
79.75,the menstrual cycle--
81.28,and the menstrual cycle
in,today's conversation
83.83,can best be thought of as
a,biological cycle that
86.95,occurs in females that allows
the,potential for fertilization
90.94,"by the sperm, because"
that's,"really what it is,"
93.04,and it's a beautifully
orchestrated,process
95.08,that I'll describe to you.
96.22,"And I should say, all people,"
males,"and females, should"
99.79,really understand how the
menstrual,"cycle works,"
101.95,how it impacts
"fertilization,",but also
105.43,how it impacts the brain and
"body,","behavior, psychology,"
108.46,et cetera.
109.12,And we'll also talk
about,"spermatogenesis,"
112.45,how sperm cells come to
be,and how they arrive--
116.74,"that is, how they"
swim,to the egg--
118.45,and the incredible interplay
between,the biology
121.81,of the sperm and the
biology,of the egg
125.47,leads to this incredible thing
that,we call embryogenesis
128.77,and the birth of the
child,"and, of course,"
131.93,the development of that child
into,"an infant, a toddler,"
136.21,"an adolescent, a"
"teen,",and an adult.
139.6,"Today's discussion,"
"again,",is not just
141.79,for those of you that are
seeking,to have children.
144.55,And I say that because
when,"you look at the data,"
148.42,you look at the literature
on,"longevity and vitality,"
151.87,two themes in biology that
oftentimes,people lump together
155.55,but aren't always the
same--,"for instance,"
157.3,there are a lot
of,things that we
158.675,can do to increase our
vitality,that actually
161.17,can harm our longevity.
163.45,But there are a subset of
biological,rules and mechanisms
167.86,"that, when aligned,"
allow,us to maximize both
171.1,our vitality and our longevity.
174.14,And I think it's fair to say
that,all of those mechanisms
177.43,and tools are housed
in,the discussion
179.65,around maximizing fertility.
181.942,And that's true whether or
not,you're male or female.
184.15,"In other words, if"
you,want children
186.22,"or if you don't, if you"
already,have children
188.26,"or if you don't, understanding"
how,fertility and fertilization
192.85,occurs in the
brain,and body will
195.67,allow you to maximize your
vitality,and longevity.
198.76,"And of course,"
today's,discussion
200.26,will provide an
understanding,of the biology
202.63,and many actionable tools that
will,also help you conceive
205.42,"children, if that's your wish."
206.98,"So of course, as is"
characteristic,"of this podcast,"
210.02,we will discuss
science-based,"tools,"
212.18,"including behavioral tools, both"
the,"dos and the don'ts, and we"
215.86,will discuss nutrition-based
tools,and supplementation-based
219.25,"tools and some other practices,"
including,things like
222.55,"acupuncture, which have quite"
good,data to support them
226.09,in terms of improving fertility.
227.8,And we will discuss why those
certain,practices can work.
231.76,And we will discuss
prescription,drugs
233.89,that your doctor can prescribe
to,"you if, for instance, you"
237.82,have a deficit at the
level,of hormone production
240.107,or neurotransmitter production
at,the level of the brain
242.44,or the pituitary gland--
243.52,I'll explain what all of
those,things are soon--
245.74,"or the gonads, the ovary and"
the,testes in females and males
250.03,respectively.
252.08,"Again, by the end"
of,"today's episode,"
253.64,you will have a lot of knowledge
and,actionable tools related
256.39,to maximizing
"fertility,",and you will
258.85,have a lot of knowledge and
actionable,tools related
261.49,to maximizing vitality
and,longevity.
264.76,"Before we begin, I'd"
like,to emphasize
266.532,that this podcast is separate
from,my teaching and research
268.99,roles at Stanford.
270.07,"It is, however, part"
of,my desire and effort
272.29,to bring zero cost to
consumer,information
274.24,about science and
science-related,tools
276.1,to the general public.
277.45,In keeping with
that,"theme, I'd like"
278.95,to thank the sponsors
of,today's podcast.
281.42,Our first sponsor
is,Maui Nui Meats.
283.69,"Maui Nui Meats, I"
can,"confidently say,"
285.82,are the most nutrient-dense and
delicious,red meat available.
288.97,Maui Nui he spent
nearly,a decade
290.77,building a USDA-certified
wild,harvesting system
294.1,to help balance invasive
deer,populations
296.29,on the island of Maui.
297.76,The solution they built
turns,the proliferation
299.86,of an invasive species
into,a wide range
302.14,"of nutrient-dense products, from"
fresh,butcher cuts and organ
305.17,"meats to bone broth,"
"jerky,",and even pet treats.
308.22,Their bone broth has
an,unmatched 25 grams
310.59,of protein per 100 calories.
312.563,I've talked before
on,this podcast
313.98,and I've had several expert
guests,come on this podcast
316.5,to talk about the fact
that,most people should aim
319.32,to get 1 gram of quality
protein,per pound
322.47,of body weight per day
in,order to maximize
324.78,"their health, tissue repair,"
which,includes brain tissue
327.45,"repair, and, if you're an active"
"exerciser,",to support recovery
331.23,from exercise.
332.82,Maui Nui Meats have an
incredible,quality protein
336.09,to calorie ratio.
337.35,And I mentioned the bone broth.
339.13,I should also mention that their
ground,meats and their venison
341.82,steaks are absolutely
"delicious,",and their jerky
344.13,is absolutely terrific.
345.12,"In fact, it's the only jerky"
that,I've eaten consistently
347.7,that I happen to like
consistently,over time.

362.4,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Eight Sleep.
365.13,Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers,"with cooling, heating,"
367.83,and sleep tracking capacity.
369.63,I've talked many times
before,on this podcast
371.73,about the fact that sleep
is,the fundamental layer
374.34,"of mental health, physical"
"health,",and performance.
376.57,"Now, one of the key things for"
getting,a great night's sleep
379.07,every single night is to
optimize,the temperature
381.48,of your sleeping environment.
382.95,"Put simply, in order to fall"
asleep,"and stay deeply asleep,"
386.37,your body temperature needs to
drop,by about 1 to 3 degrees.
389.34,"And waking up, on"
the,"other hand,"
391.12,involves a heating of your
body,by about 1 to 3 degrees.
394.59,"With Eight Sleep, you"
can,tune the temperature
397.47,of your mattress
cover,or mattress
399.51,to be cooler or
"hotter,",depending on
401.855,whether or not you tend to
run,"too hot or too cold,"
403.98,and you can even vary
it,across the night
405.78,so that you can access
the,best deep sleep early
408.0,"in the night, the so-called"
REM,"sleep, rapid eye movement"
410.52,"sleep, that's more pronounced"
in,the later half of the night
413.02,and in doing so really
get,"your sleep optimized,"
415.26,not just in terms of duration
but,in terms of quality
417.81,and the overall
architecture,of your sleep.
419.85,This has a profound influence
on,"your alertness, focus, mood,"
423.143,and many other important
factors,throughout the day.

431.79,Today's episode is also brought
to,us by Momentous Supplements.
434.55,I want to acknowledge that not
everybody,"needs supplements,"
437.008,"and yet many, many people"
derive,tremendous benefit
439.47,from proper supplementation.
441.37,I would count myself
in,that group.
442.92,There are excellent supplements
for,improving the depth
445.59,"and quality of sleep,"
for,"improving focus,"
448.38,and for improving energy
and,for hormone optimization
451.5,and many other factors related
to,"our mental health, physical"
454.23,"health, and performance."
455.3,We've partnered with
Momentous,Supplements
457.05,for three important reasons.
458.262,"First of all,"
Momentous,supplements
459.72,are of the very highest quality.
461.342,"Second of all, they"
ship,"internationally,"
463.05,and we know that
many,of you reside
464.508,outside of the United States.
465.81,"And third, they focus on"
single,ingredient formulations.
468.67,This is very important.
469.75,There is a place for blends.
471.21,"But in most cases, if you're"
going,to develop a supplement
474.09,"protocol, you want it to be"
single-ingredient,formulations
477.03,so that you can adjust the
dosages,of different things
479.28,according to what works and
doesn't,"work for you, which"
481.572,is essentially impossible
to,do if you are using
483.63,multi-ingredient formulations.
485.29,If you'd like to see the
supplements,that I take
487.29,and that we've discussed here
on,"the Huberman Lab podcast,"
489.707,you can go to livemomentous--
spelled,O-U-S--
491.82,so livemomentous.com/huberman
and,get 20% off any
496.18,supplements.
496.68,"Again, that's"
livemomentous.com/huberman,
499.17,to get 20% off.
500.52,Let's talk about fertility.
501.78,"And in doing so, let's take"
a,step back from this word
504.12,"""fertility"" and ask, what is"
fertility,and fertilization
507.45,really all about?
508.69,"Well, the obvious answer is that"
it's,about producing offspring.
511.77,"But more importantly, it's"
about,producing offspring
514.95,that contain the genetic
components,of both parents
518.61,and indeed contain half of
the,genes from one parent
521.82,and half of the genes
from,another parent.
523.74,"Now, there are two general"
types,of cells in the body.
526.73,The most common types
of,cells in the body
528.48,are called somatic cells.
529.57,So these would be all
the,cells in your body
531.403,except the egg in females
and,the sperm in males.
534.9,The egg in females
and,the sperm males
537.33,are part of what's
called,the germline.
539.04,"And again, it has nothing"
to,do with infection.
540.998,It's just that the cells of the
germline,have genes that cannot
545.34,be modified by the behavior
of,the individual that houses
549.3,those genes.
550.2,What do I mean by that?
551.26,"Well, if I were to tell you that"
by,exercising you can improve
554.31,"mitochondrial function,"
you,can change hormones
558.54,"by reducing stress,"
you,can reduce cortisol
560.91,"by hitting puberty,"
for,"instance, you"
564.36,will have the secretion of
hormones,that then change
566.845,gene expression in
other,"cells, leading"
568.47,to the development of
body,"hair, facial hair,"
571.14,"deepening the voice,"
breast,"growth, et cetera,"
573.925,"you'd say, OK, great."
574.8,"Yeah, that all"
makes,perfect sense.
576.91,But that's all occurring in
the,so-called somatic cells.
579.6,The germ cells or
the,germline cells--
581.91,"that is, the egg and the sperm--"
583.98,are a very unique
and,protected set
586.26,of cells that are generated
in,a particular way
589.47,and whose genetic components are
not,modifiable by experience.
595.272,And when you take a step
back,"and you think about it,"
597.48,"you say, oh, that's right."
598.563,There's no reason to
think,that exercising
600.99,will make the children that
you,have not yet had stronger.
605.02,"And you say, of course not."
606.27,"Well, why is that?"
607.09,"Well, that's because"
there,is a barrier
609.27,between the genes of the
germline,cells and behaviors.
614.01,They cannot be modified by
behaviors,and the various
616.62,things that you do
in,your lifetime.
618.39,"Now, I suppose"
there's,an exception
619.92,in the negative direction.
621.96,And what I'm referring to
here,"is if you were to, say,"
624.3,be exposed to a chemical
that,could mutate the DNA
627.15,of your egg or sperm or if you
were,to fertilize an embryo
632.01,in a certain way or at a certain
stage,of life that it got
635.07,"an extra chromosome,"
for,instance--
636.528,we'll talk about this
a,little bit later--
638.278,"well, then, of course,"
you,could end up
639.96,with offspring
that,have modified
642.24,DNA that don't faithfully
represent,half of the genes
645.75,from mom and half of
the,genes from dad.
648.21,But that's not the same
as,specific behaviors
651.39,modifying the genes
of,those cells--
653.55,the sperm and the egg cells--
655.32,in a way that improves
the,offspring.
658.71,So the key first thing
to,understand today
660.613,is that there's a distinction
between,"somatic cells, which"
663.03,is the vast majority
of,"cells in your body,"
664.44,and the so-called
germline,"cells, which"
665.79,are the egg and the sperm.
666.873,The egg and the sperm are these
highly,protected populations
669.69,"of cells that, in"
"females,",actually come
673.41,to be during embryogenesis.
676.11,So for all females
out,"there, you"
678.84,generate what today I'm going
to,refer to as a vault of cells.
682.44,You have a vault of eggs
that,are your germline.
686.73,Those eggs all contain all
the,chromosomes of your DNA.
692.08,So it's going to
be--,as most of you
693.62,"know, there are 23 chromosomes,"
and,chromosomes exist in pairs.
697.45,So the way to think about this
is,"each pair is one strand,"
700.53,and you have 22
so-called,"autosomes,"
702.66,and then you have
one,sex chromosome.
704.4,The sex chromosome will be
either,"X or Y. So in a female,"
707.38,they have two X chromosomes.
708.76,So in each one of the
eggs,that a woman has
711.12,and that she's had
since,she was an embryo
713.64,and that's contained
in,"this vault,"
715.5,"those eggs are, of course, going"
to,be very immature at birth.
719.52,She hasn't undergone
puberty,yet.
720.96,"And certainly, as an embryo,"
she,hasn't undergone puberty.
723.51,And those cells are
going,to contain
725.91,23 pairs of chromosomes.
728.81,This is very important--
729.81,23 pairs of chromosomes.
732.1,The chromosomes are
essentially,the wrapped-up DNA
736.32,that contains all the
genetic,information
738.33,to create any cell
type,in the body
740.19,and actually to create an
entirely,new individual.
743.41,"Now, there are 23 pairs of"
"chromosomes,",22 of which
746.76,are called autosomes.
748.433,If that doesn't
make,"sense to you,"
749.85,"just remember, autosome,"
"OK,",there's 22 of them.
752.32,And then there's one
so-called,sex chromosome.
754.5,The sex chromosomes are either
X,"or Y. But this is a female,"
757.99,so she's going to have
23,"pairs of chromosomes,"
760.5,and she's going to have two
X,chromosomes for the sex
764.4,chromosomes.
765.118,If this is already confusing
to,"you, don't worry,"
767.16,I'll make it very clear how
this,all relates to fertility
770.13,and how it relates to
chromosomal,segregation
773.01,and a bunch of things that I
think,maybe you've heard of
775.59,and that perhaps
were,opaque to you.
777.945,But I promise to
make,them clear.
779.32,"But just understand that,"
within,"each of those eggs,"
781.487,they have 23 pairs
of,chromosomes.
783.57,And for those of you
that,"like nomenclature,"
786.78,I'll tell you that those
cells,are considered diploid.
789.42,They're called the
"diploid,",and that
791.16,means that they have 23
pairs,"of chromosomes,"
794.01,as distinguished
from,cells that are
796.89,haploid where there's only one
set,of those 23 chromosomes.
802.21,"So instead of 23 pairs,"
there's,only 23 chromosomes.
805.0,We'll come back to haploid
cells,a little bit later.
808.51,"So when a female is born,"
she,has all these eggs
812.46,"in the reserve, in"
this,"vault, that she'll"
814.53,have for her entire life.
815.64,She's not going
to,make any more.
817.26,"But they are very,"
very,immature.
819.24,So when a woman is
in,"embryogenesis,"
821.79,she develops these
very,immature eggs.
824.932,Today we're also going
to,"talk about follicles,"
826.89,and we will be careful
to,distinguish follicles
830.16,from eggs.
830.85,They're often talked about
"interchangeably,",online
833.43,and elsewhere and even by
fertility,docs and OB/GYNs.
836.16,But right now we're just talking
about,"the egg cells, the eggs"
840.33,"themselves, which are cells."
842.64,"Now, the goal of"
fertilization,is
845.58,to bring that egg cell
into,close enough proximity
848.31,that it can be fertilized
by,a single sperm cell.
852.3,And that sperm cell will
bring,"23 chromosomes, as well,"
856.89,that include--
857.73,"just as in the female egg, it'll"
have,22 autosomes and one sex
862.38,chromosome.
863.17,"And in the male,"
that,sex chromosome
864.87,"can either be an X chromosome,"
which,then would give rise
868.91,"to female offspring, or a"
Y,"chromosome, which would"
872.0,give rise to male offspring.
873.92,And today we're not talking
about,sexual differentiation.
876.62,That's a topic of a previous
and,yet another future episode.
879.44,But just to give you a sense
of,how X chromosomes and Y
883.22,chromosomes can
actually,accomplish
885.11,"that sexual differentiation,"
both,of body and brain.
889.73,I'll just mention in two
sentences,"that, for instance,"
892.8,if there's a Y chromosome as
opposed,"to an X chromosome,"
895.58,that Y chromosome contains genes
that,"suppress, for instance,"
899.76,the development of
female,genitalia
901.88,and thereby give rise
to,male genitalia.
905.458,So rather than the
formation,"of a clitoris,"
907.25,it's the formation of a penis.
908.902,And rather than the
formation,"of ovaries,"
910.61,the formation of a testes.
912.14,So that's more directed
towards,sexual differentiation.
914.438,We're not going to get
into,that right now.
916.23,We'll get into that
in,a future episode.
918.05,But even if you're
only,tracking about 10%
921.56,"of what I'm saying right now,"
I,promise you're doing great.
924.15,If you're tracking
more,"than 10%, well,"
925.82,then you're doing
terrifically,"well,"
927.32,because the essence of fertility
and,fertilization is to bring
930.44,together that haploid cell that
is,the sperm that only has 23
937.34,chromosomes-- but not
pairs,of chromosomes
940.55,because that's
the,DNA from dad--
942.47,"together with the egg,"
"which,","as I told you already,"
945.95,has 23 pairs of chromosomes.
947.97,So part of the
fertilization,process
950.57,has to be to get rid of
one,half of those 23 pairs
954.56,in the female.
955.25,You got to get
rid,"of it, and you"
958.36,have to get the egg and
the,sperm in proximity
960.82,so that the egg can
potentially,be fertilized
963.4,by the sperm bringing
the,"DNA, the 23"
967.24,single strands of
chromosomes,"from dad,"
971.53,into a cell that has 23
single,strands from mom.
976.13,So I realize I'm probably being
a,"little bit repetitive here,"
978.79,but I want everyone
to,understand this
981.34,because it really frames up
fertility,and reproduction
984.55,in the proper way.
986.77,We've got a cell from
"mom,","the egg, which"
989.65,has 23 pairs of chromosomes.
992.87,We need to get rid of
one,set of those pairs
995.86,so that there's
only,23 chromosomes.
997.75,We need to get rid of
half,of those chromosomes.
1000.3,And then we need to bring
that,cell together physically
1003.54,with the sperm cell
that,contains the 23
1008.13,chromosomal strands from dad.
1010.562,And we need to bring
those,together so that you
1012.52,get 23 chromosomal
pairs,from dad
1014.86,and 23 chromosomal
pairs,from mom.
1018.01,"And in doing so, you"
create,"a cell, which"
1022.21,then becomes multiple cells.
1023.62,That's going to be the
developing,embryo that
1025.569,has half the genes from mom
and,half the genes from dad.
1028.089,So I hope that's clear.
1029.56,That is the biological
"logic,",which I realize
1032.342,is a bit of a tongue twister.
1033.55,But forgive me.
1034.96,It is the most accurate way
to,describe this process.
1037.72,We're trying to bring
together,the 23 single strands
1041.589,of chromosomes
from,dad and the 23
1043.48,single strands of chromosomes
from,mom into the same cell.
1047.95,"Now, that requires a"
literal,physical contact
1051.85,and pairing of the two cells.
1053.38,"But as I mentioned before,"
all,these eggs in mom
1057.76,"are sitting in a vault, and"
they're,"very, very immature."
1060.58,So the ovulatory cycle
and,the menstrual cycle
1064.45,are really about
first,eliminating
1067.06,half of the chromosomal pairs
in,that 23 sets of chromosomes
1071.86,"and not getting rid of,"
for,"instance, half--"
1074.71,just going 1 to 11 or 12 to 23.
1079.42,That's not the goal.
1080.39,The goal is to have
chromosomes,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5,"
1082.84,"6, all the way up to"
"23,",but only to have
1085.6,half of the chromosomes there
and,to bring that cell together
1089.23,"with the sperm cell,"
"physically,",then allow
1091.99,them to fuse and allow
the,chromosomes from dad
1094.99,and the chromosomes from mom
to,fuse within a single cell
1098.38,and duplicate into cells that
contain,half of the chromosomes
1102.07,from dad and half of the
chromosomes,from mom.
1104.29,That's what the ovulatory
and,menstrual cycle
1106.42,are really all about.
1107.752,So when thinking
about,"it that way,"
1109.21,I'd like to just initiate the
discussion,by focusing first
1112.09,"on the female component,"
or,"the egg component,"
1115.78,of fertility and fertilization.
1119.65,"As I mentioned before, a"
female,"has all the eggs,"
1123.31,"albeit very immature eggs, that"
she's,going to have at the time
1126.82,that she's born.
1128.32,"Now, puberty will"
happen,at some point
1132.34,and will allow the ovulatory
and,the menstrual cycle
1135.7,to commence.
1137.095,"Now, one question that"
you,perhaps are asking
1138.97,"is, what controls"
the,onset of puberty?
1141.1,And there are a number
of,"different results,"
1144.053,each of which could
be,an entire episode
1145.72,of a podcast on its own.
1147.04,But I'll just
highlight,a few things
1148.54,that we know about the onset
of,"menses or menstruation,"
1152.77,or it's sometimes also
called,a menarche.
1154.942,One thing that you'll notice
about,today's discussion
1157.15,is that if you were to take
any,number of your notes
1159.46,online and put them
into,a search function
1162.28,that you would see a lot
of,different language used
1164.68,for the same thing.
1165.65,"So for instance,"
some,people will
1166.45,talk about the egg and the
follicle,"as the same thing,"
1168.73,even though they are not.
1169.96,I'll explain the
difference,soon.
1171.335,Some people will talk about
menses,or menstruation
1173.5,or menarche as the
exact,same thing.
1175.19,"And in fact, they are"
not,"the exact same thing,"
1177.22,but oftentimes these words
are,used interchangeably.
1180.34,I'll do my best today to not
overload,you with nomenclature
1183.22,but rather to use the
most,commonly used terms
1186.97,for the different aspects of
fertility,and fertilization.
1189.94,But when it comes to
the,"onset of puberty,"
1192.7,"first of all, most"
of,you have probably
1195.01,heard that the
onset,of puberty is
1198.64,happening much
earlier,in females now
1200.89,than it was some years ago.
1202.31,"And in fact, that is the case."
1204.13,And I'll talk about
some,statistics related
1206.05,to this which are
pretty,striking
1208.06,but don't necessarily point
to,anything detrimental.
1211.74,It doesn't necessarily mean
that,something bad is happening.
1214.24,What do we know for sure?
1215.38,"Well, we know that"
there,are a number
1217.75,of signals that come
both,through the brain
1220.3,and through the body--
1222.37,and more likely both-- in order
to,control the onset of puberty
1225.34,in females.
1226.27,A couple of examples-- the
first,is a mechanistic one.
1229.3,"We know, for instance,"
that,the entire process
1233.35,of the ovulatory menstrual cycle
is,initiated from the brain.
1236.398,We're going to get
into,this in a lot
1237.94,more detail in a few minutes.
1239.148,But there's a certain number of
hormones,and neurotransmitters
1242.86,that are communicated
from,"the brain,"
1245.2,a structure called
the,"hypothalamus,"
1247.01,which roughly sits above
the,"roof of your mouth,"
1249.7,and that communicates
with,"a gland, an endocrine"
1253.24,or hormone-releasing gland
called,the pituitary gland.
1256.85,The pituitary gland looks
like,a stalk that essentially
1261.58,extends out of the brain.
1263.06,It's also located not far
from,the roof of your mouth.
1266.14,And that has two
sort,of small marble
1268.9,"or grape-sized protrusions,"
the,anterior pituitary
1273.863,and the posterior pituitary.
1275.03,And they release different
hormones,into the bloodstream.
1278.29,Puberty is in part
controlled,by the fact
1281.59,"that, up until"
"puberty,",there are
1284.56,neurons in the
hypothalamus,that release
1286.54,a neurotransmitter called
"GABA,","which is inhibitory,"
1288.97,and that prevents the
neurons,in the hypothalamus
1292.15,from releasing a very
important,hormone called
1296.35,gonadotropin-releasing
"hormone,",or GnRH.
1299.42,So the first thing I'd
really,like everyone
1301.24,to know and commit to
memory,today is very easy--
1303.49,GnRH stands for
gonadotropin-releasing,hormone.
1306.95,This comes from
the,brain and will
1308.89,communicate to the pituitary
to,release certain hormones.
1312.37,"Prior to puberty, in"
both,"males and females,"
1316.33,there are neurons in the brain
that,are actively suppressing
1319.54,the neurons that release GnRH.
1321.49,"It's like no puberty,"
no,"puberty, no puberty."
1323.925,You can't have puberty.
1324.942,You can't have puberty.
1325.9,"And in fact, those cells are"
releasing,this neurotransmitter
1329.85,called GABA because
it's,inhibitory.
1331.35,It prevents the firing
of,those neurons.
1333.8,So puberty is
actively,suppressed up
1335.95,until a certain point.
1337.06,"It's also actively suppressed,"
at,least in some species and we
1340.21,think at least partially in
"humans,",by the tonic release--
1344.35,that means the ongoing
"release,",around the clock--
1347.05,of a hormone called melatonin.
1349.48,Later in life-- in
"fact,",after puberty--
1352.54,melatonin will be secreted only
in,the dark phase of each night
1357.1,and around the time
that,one goes to sleep.
1359.27,But in children
and,in particular
1361.96,in children prior to
"puberty,",melatonin
1364.0,is released more
or,less constantly.
1366.67,"Now, melatonin isn't"
the,only source
1368.737,of suppression of puberty.
1369.82,It's also these neural
mechanisms,involving GABA.
1373.15,But it is certainly a
great,candidate for one
1376.39,of the reasons why
puberty,doesn't generally
1378.4,"tend to happen at,"
"say,",age four age five.
1380.53,That would be very unusual.
1383.74,Another component of
suppression,of puberty
1387.49,is that typically in children
they,have relatively low body
1391.09,fat stores.
1391.85,Why is this important?
1392.81,"Well, we know that one of"
the,things that can trigger
1395.86,the onset of puberty-- in
particular,in females--
1398.77,is that when enough
body,"fat accumulates,"
1402.25,that body fat releases
a,"hormone called leptin,"
1405.64,and that hormone leptin
travels,"in the bloodstream,"
1408.55,"across the blood-brain barrier,"
and,goes to the hypothalamus
1411.31,and can trigger the
onset,of puberty
1412.99,by activating the
neurons,that release
1415.99,gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
1417.71,So many people believe that
one,of the reasons that puberty
1421.21,is happening earlier
and,earlier in females
1423.82,is because of the accumulation
of,more body fat at younger
1428.05,ages than was observed 30 or
40,and certainly 100 years ago.
1432.79,"Now, I can already imagine a"
number,"of people are thinking,"
1435.7,"oh, this must relate"
to,the obesity crisis.
1438.05,"And indeed, there is"
a,crisis of obesity.
1439.81,Obesity is something that is
causing,all sorts of problems
1444.94,with people's health at
various,"levels, brain and body,"
1447.94,and that is far
more,frequent today
1449.74,than it was even 20 years ago.
1451.76,So it is indeed a
crisis,because it
1453.55,has enormous detrimental
effects,for so many aspects
1456.79,of brain and body
health,and longevity.
1460.27,But this whole process of
thinking,about body fat
1462.807,signaling leptin to the
hypothalamus,and the onset
1464.89,of puberty doesn't
necessarily,have
1467.24,to do with the obesity crisis.
1468.49,"It might relate, but it could"
also,"relate to, for instance,"
1471.52,"improved nutrition,"
which,is allowing body
1473.83,fat stores to accumulate maybe
not,to the level of obesity
1476.89,but to accumulate earlier
and,at younger ages
1480.1,"in females, which"
is,then causing
1482.23,earlier puberty in females.
1484.39,To just highlight how
that,"might be possible,"
1486.67,I want to review some data that
talk,"about the onset of menses,"
1490.63,menstruation--
that,"is, puberty--"
1492.67,in females according to
country,and according
1495.7,to age over the last
100,or more years.
1499.01,So what are the
general,trends in terms
1500.752,of the onset of
puberty,in females?
1502.21,"Well, that's an"
easy,one to answer.
1504.94,Over the last 100 years or
"so,",the onset of puberty
1509.32,has been occurring much earlier
with,each passing decade.
1513.88,It's really an incredible
set,of statistics.
1517.21,I will provide a
link,to these data
1518.71,since I know a number of
you,are listening and not
1520.793,just watching on YouTube.
1522.62,This is from a study in
which,the onset of puberty
1525.46,has been analyzed from
as,early as the 1850s--
1529.27,"in certain countries,"
there,are data on that--
1531.52,out to the 1970s and
in,other countries
1533.47,"starting at about 1900,"
extending,out to about 1990.
1537.55,These are ongoing
collections,of data.
1539.98,But just to give you a sense
of,how the data are falling out
1542.932,in a couple of
different,"countries,"
1544.39,just to give you a flavor--
1546.1,but for those of you listening
and,"for those of you watching,"
1550.21,the essence of all
of,these findings
1552.43,is that puberty is
happening,"much, much earlier"
1554.89,with each passing decade.
1556.15,"So for instance, in the United"
"States,","around 1900 or 1903,"
1562.28,"the average age of menarche,"
the,"onset of puberty, in females"
1566.14,"was about 14 years old, whereas"
in,"1990, the average age is 11."
1571.84,So that's a pretty
"significant,","we can say,"
1575.08,acceleration of the
onset,of puberty.
1577.61,"Now, of course,"
these,are averages.
1579.08,So there will be exceptions.
1580.55,There's a distribution of data.
1582.55,"Today, still, there will"
be,young females who
1585.22,will undergo puberty at age
11,or 10 or maybe even 9
1588.28,and others who will undergo
puberty,"at age 13, 14, maybe"
1591.67,even 16 or 17.
1593.44,"However, if we look"
"at,","for instance,"
1596.06,"the data from Norway, which"
dates,back quite far-- they
1598.57,have excellent record-keeping--
to,"1850, what we see"
1602.14,is that the average age of the
onset,of female puberty in 1850
1606.73,in Norway was 17 years
"old,","whereas in 1970, it's"
1612.33,13 years old.
1613.69,So this is a
dramatic,acceleration
1616.11,of the onset of puberty.
1617.357,And you see a similar trend
in,"other countries, as well."
1619.69,"So if we were to look,"
for,"instance, in the UK,"
1623.07,they have a smaller data
"set,",meaning it only
1625.68,extends back to about 1940.
1627.81,But the average age of the onset
of,puberty in the UK in 1940
1631.98,was 13 and 1/2 years old.
1633.69,"Again, this is just for females."
1635.52,"And in 1970, it"
was,"closer to 13,"
1638.46,with a trend towards
declining,even further.
1640.542,"Unfortunately, they"
didn't,continue
1642.0,to collect data out to 2022.
1644.76,"And as a final point, if we"
were,"to look at, for instance,"
1647.71,"in Germany and Finland,"
the,average onset
1651.06,of puberty in 1870 was
16,and 1/2 years old.
1654.9,"By 1940, it was down to"
13,and 1/2 years old.
1658.24,So all of these data have
borne,"out over and over again,"
1662.31,regardless of location in the
"world,","which is important,"
1664.68,because when you start to
think,"about the obesity crisis,"
1666.54,"you can say, well, that's"
mainly,"in developed countries,"
1668.91,believe it or not-- or
perhaps,not surprisingly.
1671.13,And maybe it has to do
with,the obesity crisis.
1673.57,And yet I don't think we
can,conclude that at all.
1676.2,"Something is happening, however."
1678.33,It could be increased
body,fat stores
1681.18,due to overeating and obesity.
1682.75,"However, it could also"
be--,"unrelated to obesity,"
1685.41,"it could be, for"
"instance,",improved
1687.81,nutrition and the availability
of,"quality nutrition, which"
1691.53,can signal the
maturation,of the brain
1693.96,and body mechanisms that
trigger,"the onset of puberty,"
1696.96,"ovulatory cycle,"
and,menstruation.
1698.82,So we want to be very careful
about,leaping to conclusions
1701.37,"about what these trends mean,"
but,the trends themselves
1704.04,"are very, very apparent."
1705.63,And as a final
"point,",I should also
1707.43,mention that there are a
number,of different behavioral
1709.98,"and psychosocial, as they're"
"called,",interactions that
1712.92,can influence puberty as well.
1714.64,This has been most strikingly
observed,in animals.
1717.61,And so I don't want
anyone,to be alarmed
1719.37,or to leap to any great
conclusions,about the onset
1722.31,of timing of puberty in
"humans,",but I'd be remiss
1724.798,if I didn't tell you about
a,certain result which
1726.84,shows that if a young female
is,exposed to the odor--
1732.63,not necessarily the pheromones.
1734.16,There's a distinction between
odors,that we perceive
1736.77,"and pheromones, which"
are,subconscious.
1739.82,"We don't actively perceive, but"
that,"can impact our biology,"
1743.207,and pheromones effects in
humans,are very controversial.
1745.54,"But we know, for instance, that"
if,you take a female animal--
1748.56,and there's some
evidence,from humans
1750.63,that if you take a
young,prepubertal female
1753.6,and you expose her to the scent
of,a reproductively-competent
1759.45,"male for a series of days,"
but,maybe even as short
1765.3,"as a few hours,"
and,she is also not
1769.02,regularly being exposed to
the,"scent of her father,"
1772.59,that she can undergo
puberty,earlier.
1774.9,That's right.
1775.74,There is something
about,the odor
1777.72,"and/or pheromones, or"
perhaps,"something else, that"
1782.46,occurs when a young prepubertal
female,has a father that she's
1787.73,in regular contact with.
1788.73,He wouldn't necessarily have
to,live at home but that
1790.938,is around a lot that
his,smell is registered
1794.46,by her biological systems.
1796.71,That-- I don't want
to,say protects
1798.99,because it kind of skews the
valence,"of the conversation,"
1802.14,but that offsets or buffers
the,"otherwise observed effect,"
1808.39,which is that the scent of a
reproductively-competent,"male,"
1811.86,if it's present often enough
or,"perhaps intensely enough,"
1814.92,that it can trigger the onset
of,puberty in that female.
1817.44,"In other words, the scent of"
a,male that is not the father
1822.09,and we think also that is not
biologically,related to her
1825.12,can trigger earlier
onset,of puberty.
1827.85,And that effect can at
least,be partially buffered
1832.35,by her being in the
presence,of the scent
1836.04,from her biological father.
1837.99,"Now, some of you are"
probably,already leaping
1840.0,to conclusions about
what,this means.
1841.542,Should you not
allow,your daughter
1843.593,to be exposed to
any,males who are
1845.01,"of reproductive age, et cetera?"
1847.05,That's certainly
not,what I'm saying.
1848.635,There's a huge number
of,considerations
1850.26,that go into that
calculation,for everybody
1852.78,"and circumstances, et cetera."
1854.52,But the point is that the odors
of,"individuals, both related--"
1860.97,"in particular, closely related--"
and,"non-related individuals,"
1865.41,can shape the neural systems
and,the hormone systems that
1870.597,can trigger the onset
of,puberty or suppress
1872.43,the onset of puberty.
1873.54,So whether or not we're
talking,about onset
1875.37,of puberty at this
age,or that age
1877.05,and whether or not
biologically-related,male
1880.14,or non-biologically-related
male,"scents around,"
1882.24,"et cetera, the thing I"
want,everyone to know
1885.09,is that at some point
during,"development,"
1887.85,typically nowadays between
the,ages of 11 and 15
1892.77,"or so-- again, there's"
variability,there.
1896.55,The suppression of
gonadotropin-releasing,hormone
1899.49,released from the
hypothalamus,"is removed,"
1901.77,and then
gonadotropin-releasing,hormone
1904.47,can activate cells
within,the pituitary.
1907.11,And if you really
want,"to know, it's"
1908.61,the anterior pituitary
in,particular.
1910.77,And then the anterior
pituitary,"gland,"
1913.3,which sits at and kind of
bridges,the brain and the body
1917.25,because it allows the release of
hormones,"into the bloodstream,"
1921.27,that anterior pituitary
is,going to release
1923.52,two key hormones that everyone
should,know the name of
1926.52,and what they do.
1927.46,"And when I say everyone,"
I,mean males and females
1929.55,need to know about
these,hormones
1931.2,because they have an active
role,in both males and females.
1934.09,"And of course, you"
should,want to know
1936.33,and should know about
the,biology of everyone
1939.15,"on the planet, in my"
"opinion,",because it tells you
1941.773,a lot more about
humans,than if you just
1943.44,focus on your own biology.
1944.82,But those two
hormones,are called
1946.83,"luteinizing hormone,"
which,"is abbreviated LH,"
1951.12,and follicle-stimulating
"hormone,",which
1954.03,is abbreviated FSH.
1955.89,So the simple picture that
you,need to have in your mind
1958.83,is gonadotropin-releasing
hormone,"from the brain,"
1961.23,from the hypothalamus
in,"particular,"
1963.45,is causing the
release,of luteinizing
1966.09,hormone and follicle-stimulating
"hormone,",GnRH stimulates
1970.92,"LH, luteinizing hormone, and"
follicle-stimulating,"hormone,"
1973.89,FSH.
1975.09,LH and FSH travel in the blood
and,can access all the cells
1979.38,and tissues of the body.
1980.38,This is one of the incredible
things,about hormones is that
1984.33,many hormones-- and LH and FSH
are,included in this group--
1988.83,"can travel into cells,"
and,they can actually
1992.55,change the genetic
expression,of those cells.
1995.04,They can change which
genes,are turned on
1996.9,and which genes are turned off.
1998.192,And they can also attach to
the,surface of those cells
2001.367,and make those cells take
on,different properties.
2003.45,So they can mature those cells.
2004.742,"So for instance, a good"
example,of this outside
2007.31,of the context we've
been,talking about
2008.99,is the hormone testosterone
can,travel to the hair follicle
2012.365,and can stimulate changes in the
genes,of the cells of the hair
2014.99,follicle that can
make,hair grow.
2017.12,"A different hormone,"
"estrogen,",can
2019.19,travel to the cells
of,the breast tissue
2021.8,and activate genes that control
enlargement,of the cells
2024.29,of the breast tissue.
2025.28,"Prolactin, a different hormone,"
can,travel to the mammary ducts
2028.52,and control the production
and,the secretion of milk.
2032.09,"And in males, that can actually"
"happen,","in certain cases,"
2035.55,although it's rare.
2036.53,But prolactin can also
travel,to areas of the brain
2039.11,"that control libido,"
for,instance.
2041.09,And just so you'll
never,"forget it,"
2043.34,males' elevated
levels,of prolactin
2045.44,are actually what set
the,refractory period
2047.54,after ejaculation
and,prevent erection
2049.639,for some period of time.
2050.94,So you'll never
forget,prolactin.
2053.96,The point being that
different,hormones
2056.09,have different effects
on,"different cells,"
2057.889,depending on what
cells,those are.
2059.366,Estrogen or estradiol is going
to,have different effects
2061.699,on the breast tissue
than,"it would on skin,"
2064.37,although as effects on both.
2065.84,"Similarly, when LH and"
"FSH,",luteinizing hormone
2069.71,and follicle-stimulating
"hormone,",travel in the blood
2072.83,to the gonad and the
gonad,"is an ovary,"
2076.82,it will have a certain
set,of consequences.
2079.86,And when luteinizing hormone
and,follicle-stimulating hormone
2082.48,travel in the blood to
a,gonad and that gonad
2084.909,"happens to be a teste, then"
it,will have a different set
2087.82,of biological implications.
2089.69,So let's focus now
on,what happens when
2092.08,LH and FSH arrive at the ovary.
2094.989,And let's assume now that we're
talking,about a female who
2099.19,has already undergone
"puberty,",or perhaps we
2102.88,could even frame this in
the,context of a female who
2105.46,is about to undergo puberty.
2107.77,FSH and LH are now able to
be,released because she's
2110.65,undergoing puberty.
2112.12,But the same set of
"processes,","essentially,"
2114.82,would occur for any point from
puberty,"onward until menopause,"
2119.51,which is the depletion of that
"vault,",that ovarian reserve
2124.18,of all those immature eggs.
2125.68,I'd like to take a brief
break,and acknowledge
2127.75,"our sponsor, Athletic Greens."
2129.79,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
vitamin,mineral probiotic
2132.97,drink that also contains
digestive,enzymes
2135.34,and adaptogens.
2136.42,I started taking Athletic
Greens,"way back in 2012,"
2139.6,so that's 10 years
now,of taking Athletic
2141.55,Greens every single day.
2142.91,So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,this podcast.
2145.223,The reason I started taking
Athletic,Greens and the reason
2147.64,I still take Athletic
Greens,is that it
2149.62,covers all of my foundational
nutritional,needs.
2152.205,So whether or not
I'm,eating well
2153.58,"or enough or not, I'm sure that"
I'm,covering all of my needs
2156.61,"for vitamins,"
"minerals,","probiotics,"
2158.53,"adaptogens to combat stress,"
and,the digestive enzymes really
2162.1,help my digestion.
2163.12,I just feel much better when
I'm,drinking Athletic Greens.
2165.598,If you'd like to
try,"Athletic Greens,"
2167.14,you can go to
"athleticgreens.com/huberman,",
2169.96,"and for the month of January,"
they,have a special offer where
2172.69,they'll give you 10 free
travel,packs plus a year supply
2176.11,of vitamin D3/K2.
2177.58,Vitamin D3 and K2 are
vital,"for immune function,"
2180.73,"metabolic function,"
hormone,"health,"
2182.38,but also calcium regulation
and,heart health.
2184.9,"Again, that's"
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2187.84,to claim their special offer in
the,month of January of 10 free
2190.87,travel packs plus a year
supply,of vitamin D3/K2.
2194.38,"OK, so we're now going"
to,talk about ovulation
2196.36,"and menstruation, and"
let's,just remember
2198.068,what this is all about.
2199.1,This is all about creating
the,potential for an egg
2202.39,"to be fertilized,"
and,that egg needs
2204.22,to have half of the
chromosomal,"pairs, so no pairs,"
2208.18,but it's got to have 23
chromosomes,just from mom.
2211.12,And we need to
position,that egg so
2213.82,that the egg can
be,met by the sperm
2216.82,and that sperm can
penetrate,that egg
2219.01,and donate its 23 individual
strands,of chromosomes
2224.2,to that egg so that you can
bring,together the DNA of dad
2227.95,and the DNA of mom.
2229.3,So the obligatory
menstrual,cycle
2231.46,occurs when luteinizing hormone
and,follicle-stimulating
2236.08,hormone have been released.
2238.12,And the
ovulatory/menstrual,cycle--
2241.81,and here I have to kind of
pick,what I want to call it.
2244.683,"I guess to be really accurate,"
we,would just call it
2246.85,"the female reproductive cycle,"
but,that includes underneath it
2250.545,"both the menstrual cycle,"
as,"it's sometimes called,"
2252.67,and the ovulatory cycle.
2254.0,So you decide.
2254.95,I'm going to interchangeably
discuss,the ovulatory cycle
2258.25,and the menstrual cycle.
2259.47,"The problem is, when"
you,"say menstruation,"
2261.22,people often think about
just,"the period, the shedding"
2263.59,of the uterine lining when
fertilization,has not occurred.
2266.63,So if I start saying
ovulatory,"cycle,"
2269.35,just keep in mind I'm
referring,to the entire thing.
2272.57,"Now, this is probably"
also,a good opportunity
2274.78,to say that if you heard that
the,ovulatory/menstrual cycle
2279.37,"is 28 days long, that's"
true,"in some cases,"
2282.85,but that's not always true.
2284.42,"It's, on average, 28 days long."
2287.2,There are some females for which
the,ovulatory cycle will be
2291.49,shorter-- it can be
as,short as 21 days--
2293.68,and other females for which
it,will be 35 days long.
2298.48,Shorter than 21 days
and,longer than 35
2300.85,"days is rare, although"
it,does occur.
2303.465,One of the key things when
thinking,about fertility
2305.59,is if you talk to OB/GYNs who
are,"focused on fertility, which"
2308.8,I have in anticipation
of,"this episode,"
2310.72,they'll tell you
that,whether or not
2313.03,your cycle is 21 days
long,or 35 days long
2316.9,is not as much of an issue
necessarily,unless it's
2320.53,happening to become much
shorter,or much longer
2324.1,in a kind of erratic way.
2325.88,So if you're somebody
who's,consistently
2327.64,had 23 day long cycles
and,all of a sudden
2330.19,you're having 30 day long
"cycles,",that's not necessarily
2333.01,an indication of anything bad.
2334.39,But if it's 21 days one month
and,it's 30 days the next month
2338.33,and it's 17 days the next
month,or even if it's always
2341.95,falling within that 21
to,35 day long cycle
2345.1,but it's very variable from
each,month or every other month
2348.04,"or so, you probably want"
to,talk to your OB/GYN
2351.605,because that could indicate
a,number of different things.
2353.98,Which things could it indicate?
2355.3,"Well, that will become"
clear,as I spell out
2357.25,the biology in a
bit,more detail.
2359.35,But this idea that the
menstrual,cycle/ovulatory cycle
2362.35,"is always 28 days,"
that's,just false.
2364.33,That's just not true.
2365.89,I should also mention that there
is,a common misconception that
2369.58,because the average menstrual
cycle,"is 28 days-- indeed,"
2372.67,the average is 28 days--
2374.14,and the lunar cycle is 28 days--
2376.607,"and of course, there"
is,a real biology
2378.19,to support the
fact,that the lunar
2379.607,"cycle can't, in fact,"
impact,certain aspects
2382.14,of human behavior.
2383.62,"It does, and we'll"
talk,about lunar cycles
2385.56,in a future episode.
2386.82,But there is zero data
to,support the idea
2390.18,that the menstrual cycle
and,the lunar cycle
2393.03,are linked in any
kind,of causal way.
2396.12,Sorry to break it to you.
2397.5,The lunar cycle and the
tidal,cycles at the ocean
2401.407,are definitely linked in ways
that,are super interesting
2403.74,related to the tilt of the
Earth,and the pull of gravity
2405.72,"of different planets, and"
it's,an incredible story
2407.94,into itself.
2409.02,But the lunar cycle and
the,"menstrual cycle,"
2411.3,despite having some weak
correlation,in terms
2413.85,of their duration or their
so-called,periodicity--
2418.41,no pun intended--
2420.21,"well, there's no causal"
relationship,whatsoever
2422.88,between the lunar cycle
and,the menstrual cycle.
2425.5,If any of you are
aware,of any real data
2428.88,that conflicts with
what,"I just said,"
2430.62,please put that in the
comment,section on YouTube.
2433.44,But this is pretty well
established,as far as I know.
2436.44,"OK, so we need to bring together"
the,"so-called haploid contents,"
2442.11,the 23 individual strands
of,"chromosomes from the egg,"
2445.62,to a place and a position
where,it could potentially
2448.26,be fertilized by the male.
2449.44,So what happens?
2450.57,Luteinizing hormone and
follicle-stimulating,hormone
2452.85,travel to the ovary.
2454.587,These hormones are able
to,access the ovary.
2456.42,There's a lot of blood
supply,to the ovary.
2458.91,And FSH and LH
arrive,at the ovary.
2463.69,"The ovary has this vault,"
this,ovarian reserve
2466.68,of immature cells.
2467.685,They reside within what
are,called follicles.
2469.56,The follicles are little
spherical,packages
2472.65,that can potentially provide a
nice,environment for those eggs
2476.58,to mature.
2477.78,"And when FSH, in particular,"
arrives,"at the ovary,"
2483.33,a small number of
those,follicles
2485.88,"will split off from the reserve,"
they,"will exit the vault,"
2490.54,and they will
undergo,maturation.
2492.9,And the key player here is
follicle-stimulating,hormone.
2497.49,And the first 14 days of the
menstrual/ovulatory,cycle
2501.75,is referred to as the
follicular,phase because
2504.84,of this relationship between
FSH,triggering the maturation
2507.72,of a subset of follicles.
2509.82,"Now, typically in the"
context,of a 28 day or so
2513.72,ovulatory/menstrual
"cycle,",day one
2515.91,is designated as the
first,"day of the period,"
2518.34,of the shedding of
the,uterine lining
2520.53,from the previous ovulatory
menstrual,cycle in which
2524.76,fertilization did not occur.
2527.17,So day one is when
the,period initiates.
2530.91,It is days 1 through
"14,",approximately--
2533.532,because here we're
just,considering
2534.99,the average of a 28-day
"cycle,",but it could be longer.
2537.1,It could be shorter.
2537.933,But the first half of that cycle
is,the so-called follicular
2541.23,"phase, FSH, has"
triggered,the departure
2544.47,of a subset of these follicles
that,contain immature eggs.
2547.71,And it is triggering the
maturation,of those eggs.
2550.68,Luteinizing hormone is
also,"present, but also"
2553.98,at relatively low levels.
2555.433,And it's during the first half
of,this ovulatory menstrual
2557.85,cycle that the main goal is to
get,those follicles to mature.
2561.48,"So inside of those follicles,"
the,egg is developing.
2564.72,It's growing.
2565.65,It's maturing.
2567.36,"And in doing so, it's also"
making,its own hormones.
2571.3,"This, I think, is one of"
the,most elegant aspects
2574.02,of the ovulatory menstrual
cycle,"that, in a few minutes,"
2577.102,you'll learn about something
which,"still to this day,"
2579.31,even though I've known about
this,stuff for decades now
2581.61,"because of my training, still"
just,blows my mind that you
2585.21,"have one hormone,"
follicle-stimulating,"hormone,"
2587.88,triggering the
maturation,of some eggs
2590.42,inside of some follicles and
then,those follicles themselves
2592.92,making another hormone
that,furthers the process
2597.18,"and then soon, as you'll learn,"
create,a hormone to trigger
2601.468,the second half of the process.
2602.76,Just a beautiful symphony of
expression,of different genes
2606.66,and different hormones
to,make everything
2608.55,work as optimally as possible.
2610.17,So as these different
follicles,"mature, somehow--"
2613.86,and we still don't
know,exactly how--
2615.96,one of those follicles
containing,an egg
2618.9,gets selected.
2620.79,It's either because
it,matures the fastest
2622.95,or there's something
about,it that
2625.92,is still not
completely,understood
2628.35,that allows it to be selected.
2630.42,And all the other
follicles,that are maturing
2633.33,degenerate and die.
2634.86,And they're gone.
2635.61,They don't go back into
the,ovarian reserve.
2637.95,They are now depleted
from,that bank account
2641.19,that is the ovarian reserve.
2643.23,They die off.
2644.7,But that single egg
"that,","keep in mind,"
2648.42,contains 23 pairs
of,chromosomes--
2651.63,we haven't gotten rid
of,one half of those 23
2655.14,sets of chromosomes yet.
2656.73,But that one will
continue,to mature.
2658.8,"And then, at some"
"point,",that egg
2663.15,will start to undergo a process
in,which those chromosomes are
2668.04,pulled apart by
little,components
2671.4,within the egg called spindles.
2673.53,They literally have
a,physical pulling
2675.48,of the chromosomes apart.
2676.57,So now those 23 pairs are no
longer,attached to one another
2680.26,at the middle like
they,"were before,"
2681.76,like two beads of strings--
2684.28,"or I should say,"
23,short strands
2687.52,of beads that were at once
connected,to one another
2691.6,now are pulled apart
so,that you have
2693.34,23 chromosomes on
each,"side, but they're"
2696.4,pulled apart from one another.
2698.9,So that diploid
cell,is now starting
2702.76,to become a cell in which
half,"of the chromosomes,"
2705.86,half of those 23
"pairs,",are physically
2708.61,pulled away from the others.
2710.11,And then the egg actually
starts,to form its own
2713.5,what we call an
involution,of membrane
2715.12,"around those 23 pairs, one set"
of,"them, and encapsulates them."
2720.49,So you sort of got
an,egg with two parts
2722.65,where the two sets
of,"chromosomes,"
2724.237,"two sets of 23 chromosomes,"
are,now separate
2726.07,from one another
inside,of the egg.
2728.17,And then one of those actually
gets,"ejected from the egg,"
2732.01,and the name of that
thing,that gets ejected--
2734.35,it's sort of like a little
Hubble,"pod is how I imagine it,"
2737.29,"you know, from Star Wars or from"
any,kind of Space Odyssey movie
2741.22,where some thing
is,ready to happen.
2743.11,A little Hubble pod
shoots,out of the ship.
2745.06,"Well, that 23 pairs is"
now,ejected from the egg.
2749.71,It's called the polar body.
2750.88,And that's going to degenerate.
2752.41,It's going to go away.
2753.67,"And in doing so, take the"
egg,"cell, which was once"
2756.73,diploid-- it had 23 pairs
of,chromosomes-- and making
2759.67,it haploid.
2761.02,"And now what you've got,"
in,"ideal circumstances,"
2764.23,is a beautifully pristine
egg,that was selected for
2767.5,and has 23 single strands
of,"chromosomes, 22 autosomes"
2771.702,and one sex chromosome.
2772.66,And that sex chromosome is
going,to be an X chromosome
2775.45,"almost with certainty,"
because,female--
2779.29,mother-- is creating that egg.
2782.54,So then the egg that contains
just,the appropriate 23
2786.64,single-stranded
chromosomes,is going
2789.25,to fuse with the wall of
the,"ovary, and that egg"
2791.53,will be released and will
travel,into the Fallopian tube.
2796.0,"Now, we'll get back to"
that,egg in a few moments.
2798.29,"But that process, which"
represents,the first half
2800.65,of the ovulatory
menstrual,"cycle, again,"
2802.45,was triggered by FSH and to
some,extent luteinizing hormone.
2805.88,But it is the ongoing maturation
of,that egg which also causes
2811.48,"the production of estrogen,"
which,allows that whole process
2815.51,to occur.
2816.01,"And you could say, why?"
2817.22,"Well, the answer to the"
why,is a very important
2819.767,biological principle
that,we are going
2821.35,to return to in a number of
different,"contexts today,"
2823.558,both as reference to
female,and male fertility.
2828.04,And the principle is a
so-called,negative feedback.
2832.55,So when estrogen is present
at,relatively low levels
2835.72,in females in the
"ovary,",as it is
2839.08,during the development of these
"eggs,","some of that estrogen,"
2842.47,"of course, is going"
to,exit the ovary.
2844.857,It's going to go
into,the bloodstream.
2846.44,And it's going to travel
back,to the pituitary.
2849.81,"Now, the pituitary"
can,release things
2852.078,like follicle-stimulating
hormone,and luteinizing
2854.12,hormone.
2854.72,But the way I'd
like,you to think
2856.4,about the pituitary for
sake,of feedback loops
2858.86,is that it's sort of
like,a thermometer
2861.02,"that you would put into a pool,"
like,"a backyard pool, that"
2864.89,is attached to the heater.
2866.39,"And for instance, if you were"
to,put a thermometer into a pool
2870.38,that you would like
to,keep at 70 degrees
2872.9,and the temperature of
that,"pool is 60 degrees,"
2875.6,"well, then that"
thermometer,ought
2877.34,to trigger some
sort,of mechanism
2879.56,where the pool would heat
up,until the temperature
2881.93,of the pool hit 70
"degrees,",and then it
2884.12,should trigger that thermometer
to,turn off the heating system.
2886.903,That's kind of a
negative,feedback
2888.32,system that would keep
the,temperature more
2890.112,or less correct.
2891.65,That's a lot of the way that
the,system's related to estrogen
2894.78,and also testosterone and
these,different things
2896.78,like luteinizing hormone and
follicle-stimulating,hormone
2899.155,work as well.
2900.02,"Typically, when the level"
of,"a hormone is too high,"
2904.35,then it shuts down
the,production
2906.02,of the hormones that would
trigger,further production
2908.3,of that hormone.
2908.84,I know that's a mouthful.
2909.68,It's a lot to think about.
2910.74,And some of you are
probably,"thinking, whoa,"
2911.82,I'm getting dizzy
now,with biology.
2913.46,"But I promise you, you"
can,understand this.
2915.35,"In females, when estrogen"
is,relatively low--
2918.36,but not zero but
is,relatively low
2920.06,during that first follicular
half,of the ovulatory cycle--
2923.84,it actually triggers negative
feedback,on LH and FSH
2927.26,so that not too
much,is produced.
2929.06,But then just
prior,"to ovulation,"
2931.61,the levels of estrogen and the
levels,of some other hormones
2934.79,from those eggs--
2936.68,you have the eggs producing
estrogen,themselves--
2939.35,gets high enough
that,it actually
2941.18,triggers a positive feedback
loop,on the pituitary.
2944.79,So the pituitary is
essentially,observing
2947.72,the amount of estrogen in
the,bloodstream produced
2949.82,"by the ovary, and the"
amount,of estrogen
2951.65,towards the end of the second
half,of the menstrual cycle
2954.35,has increased and triggers
a,positive feedback loop.
2958.16,It triggers the pituitary
to,"release more FSH and LH,"
2962.18,and that helps trigger
"ovulation,",that deployment
2966.89,or the release of that
one,mature proper selected
2969.92,egg that's haploid with the 23
individual,pairs of chromosomes
2973.46,into the Fallopian tube.
2975.665,So let's just back up
really,quickly and just
2977.54,kind of summarize
what's,happened.
2978.957,Gonadotropin-releasing
hormone,from the hypothalamus
2981.493,triggers the release of
follicle-stimulating,hormone
2983.66,and luteinizing hormone.
2984.8,That travels to the
ovary--,triggers
2986.72,the release of a subset
of,immature follicles
2990.26,with immature eggs.
2991.85,Those immature follicles
and,immature eggs
2995.03,"start to mature,"
start,to grow because
2998.18,of the presence of
follicle-stimulating,hormone.
3000.61,The growth of those eggs
themselves,increases estrogen.
3004.36,As the estrogen starts to
accumulate,"in the environment,"
3006.92,some of that travels
back,to the pituitary.
3009.22,And when levels of estrogen
arriving,at the pituitary
3012.67,are relatively
"low,",the pituitary
3015.393,"says, oh, we don't"
need,to release
3016.81,any more follicle-stimulating
and,luteinizing hormone.
3019.21,"However, at some point"
just,"prior to ovulation,"
3021.64,enough estrogen has been
produced,by that one
3024.28,single selected
mature,egg and some
3026.56,of the other follicles around
it,that were maturing but then
3029.74,since died off that the estrogen
triggers,a positive feedback
3033.86,loop.
3034.36,"The pituitary says,"
"OK,",and releases
3037.15,more follicle-stimulating
hormone,
3038.68,and luteinizing hormone.
3039.79,"And bam, the egg, which has"
the,"proper genetic components,"
3044.5,sets off out of the ovary
and,into the Fallopian tube.
3048.31,So-called ovulation has begun.
3051.79,"That itself, what"
I,"just described,"
3053.71,constitutes the first half of
the,"ovulatory/menstrual cycle,"
3056.902,which we call the
follicular,phase.
3058.36,And it's marked by the presence
of,"FSH and some other things,"
3061.36,but we can really think
about,it as marked by FSH
3064.3,from the pituitary and by
"estrogen,","or estradiol, made"
3068.86,within the ovary.
3070.28,Then comes the second half of
the,"ovulatory/menstrual cycle,"
3073.52,which I personally think is
one,of the coolest mechanisms
3076.48,"in all of biology,"
which,is that--
3079.21,remember the
follicle,that housed
3081.01,that one egg that
was,the selected
3083.23,egg that became the mature egg?
3084.88,"And that follicle, which"
no,longer contains the egg
3087.76,because the egg took
off,"and ovulated,"
3089.53,is called the corpus luteum.
3090.88,And the corpus luteum starts
making,"three hormones, which"
3094.72,"include estradiol, I"
think,"called inhibin,"
3096.628,"but the most important hormone,"
the,one that you really
3098.92,"need to know about,"
is,that it starts
3100.6,producing very high
levels,of progesterone.
3104.5,Progesterone levels
start,to increase
3107.89,about the time of
"ovulation,",although just
3110.35,prior to ovulation.
3111.53,And over the next second
half,of the ovulatory cycle--
3116.24,so about 14 days if
it's,"a 28-day cycle,"
3117.977,a little bit longer or
a,"little bit shorter,"
3119.81,depending on the
length,of cycle.
3121.185,Levels of progesterone
in,the second half
3123.04,of the ovulatory cycle are
going,"to increase by 1,400 fold"
3128.2,compared to what they
were,in the first half
3130.78,of the ovulatory cycle.
3132.74,"So again, if we"
were,to characterize
3134.29,the menstrual/ovulatory cycle
in,"broad strokes, what we would"
3138.85,say is that FSH
and,estrogen mark
3142.69,"the initial part the first half,"
the,"so-called follicular phase,"
3146.71,and that the estrogen and
FSH,"set in motion ovulation,"
3150.97,and they prime the
system,for the production
3153.7,"of a corpus luteum, which"
produces,progesterone.
3156.67,And the second
half,of all of this
3158.74,is called the luteal phase.
3161.03,The second half of the
ovulatory/menstrual,cycle
3163.21,is the luteal phase
because,"of corpus luteum,"
3166.6,this otherwise discarded tissue
that,produces progesterone.
3170.56,What does progesterone do?
3172.21,"Well, progesterone impacts"
the,"uterine lining,"
3176.71,so-called endometrium
or,"the lining,"
3178.81,the mucous lining of the uterus
where,that egg that's ovulated
3183.22,is potentially going to
implant,if it's fertilized.
3186.7,And so in a kind of
perfect,way-- or I
3189.58,"should say, in a"
seemingly,perfect way--
3192.4,the egg is off on its way.
3193.84,It might get fertilized.
3195.98,The remnants of the compartment
that,let go of that egg
3199.76,produce a hormone that then
prepares,the endometrial lining
3203.93,of the uterus for the potential
implantation,of that egg.
3207.32,It's basically making the
bed,for the fertilized egg
3210.17,"to potentially embed in,"
to,"implant in, and then"
3213.77,achieve all the nourishment that
it,"needs to grow, eventually,"
3217.04,into a healthy embryo and child.
3219.38,Just an amazing set of
biological,"mechanisms,"
3222.23,"if you ask me, because"
what,you're observing here
3225.92,is an incredible
economy,of function
3228.17,whereby the same
cellular,components that
3230.69,"are producing the egg,"
"well,",some of them
3232.48,"are being discarded,"
but,they're not being
3234.23,discarded without purpose.
3236.138,They're being
discarded,in a way that
3237.68,triggers the onset of
hormonal,expression
3241.04,that then prepares
the,fertilized
3242.48,egg to be in an enriched
environment,in which it
3245.15,can thrive.
3246.0,"Now, I realize that"
was,a lot of detail.
3247.67,But we have a couple
of,key themes.
3249.59,We've got the
"hypothalamus,",GnRH.
3251.57,We've got the pituitary
with,"LH and FSH,"
3254.09,and those hormones
travel,to the ovary.
3256.56,The ovary has eggs in a
"vault,",basically immature eggs
3260.99,in a vault. Some of those
are,activated by the presence
3264.05,of FSH and LH each month.
3266.09,And one of those eggs will
be,selected and will ovulate.
3270.2,The remnants of the
follicle,and egg
3272.06,"that are not selected, the"
chromosomes,that you don't need
3275.03,disappear in the polar body.
3276.83,And the corpus luteum gives
rise,to progesterone and sets
3280.46,in motion the second half of
the,"ovulatory menstrual cycle,"
3284.07,"which is the luteal phase,"
which,is essentially
3286.67,the potential for
that,fertilized egg
3288.5,"to embed in a nice,"
nourishing,environment.
3290.632,"And of course, we"
should,"all be thinking,"
3292.34,if the egg is fertilized
and,then it lays down
3294.65,"in the nice, comfy"
uterine,lining
3296.72,that's been prepared
by,progesterone
3299.12,"in the corpus luteum, well,"
then,everything's fine and good.
3302.78,But what if fertilization
doesn't,occur?
3304.517,"Well, we all know what happens"
if,fertilization doesn't occur.
3307.1,If fertilization does not
occur,"for whatever reason,"
3309.98,that uterine lining
is,going to shed.
3312.752,And that's actually what's
referred,to as the period.
3314.96,It's the actual removal--
3317.57,"or the departure, rather--"
3319.22,of the thickened
endometrium,lining
3323.06,of the uterus when
fertilization,has not occurred.
3328.42,"And of course, if"
that,"happens, we"
3330.13,need another ovulatory
menstrual,cycle.
3332.44,So how does that happen?
3333.44,"Well, the hormone inhibin is"
also,made by the corpus luteum
3336.94,and doesn't go quite as high
as,the hormone progesterone.
3341.32,But it kind of tracks that
increase,in progesterone
3344.92,that occurs in the second
half,of the ovulatory cycle.
3347.86,"But then, if fertilization"
does,"not occur,"
3350.98,inhibin levels start to drop.
3353.29,And what I haven't told
you,is what inhibin does.
3355.96,"Inhibin, in concert with"
other,"hormones like estrogen,"
3359.71,feed back to the hypothalamus
and,prevent the further release
3363.46,of follicle-stimulating hormone
and,luteinizing hormone.
3365.92,If you have an egg that gets
fertilized,"and can implant,"
3369.82,"well, then you don't"
want,more eggs to mature.
3373.42,You want to hold on to
the,ones in the vault.
3375.52,You don't want them to mature.
3377.56,And hormones like
inhibin,"and, again,"
3379.768,working with other
hormones,are going
3381.31,to prevent the secretion
of,things like FSH and LH.
3384.58,"Now, typically, people are not"
getting,pregnant every month.
3387.82,"In fact, that's not possible."
3389.483,And part of the reason
it's,not possible
3391.15,is that if the
fertilized,"egg implants,"
3393.11,there are a number of
different,hormone cascades
3395.11,that shut down the production
of,"things like GnRH, FSH, and LH"
3399.34,in ways that prevent further
maturation,of follicles
3402.73,and a follicular phase.
3403.93,But in the instance where
fertilization,doesn't occur
3407.24,and menstruation occurs--
3409.15,and I should mention that
the,"duration of menstruation,"
3412.12,"the actual bleeding,"
typically,is anywhere from one
3414.5,to five days.
3415.84,"The, quote, unquote,"
"heaviness,",
3417.58,the lightness or heaviness of
that,bleeding will depend on--
3421.27,you guessed it-- the amount of
progesterone,that is secreted
3424.87,from the corpus luteum.
3425.98,That's one of the
key,players there.
3428.2,"And if menstruation occurs,"
"well,",then inhibin levels
3434.02,also drop.
3434.62,Progesterone levels also drop.
3436.15,"And when that occurs,"
there's,a positive feedback
3440.14,signal up at the level
of,the pituitary.
3443.24,The pituitary
literally,can register
3445.3,how much inhibin and
progesterone,and estrogen
3448.03,is present in the bloodstream.
3449.57,And if those levels are
sufficiently,"low, well,"
3452.8,"then GnRH gets secreted again,"
FSH,"gets secreted again,"
3456.85,and LH gets secreted again.
3459.08,And the first half
the,follicular phase
3461.26,of the menstrual cycle
initiates,all over again.
3464.48,It's hard to overstate how
beautifully,orchestrated
3466.99,this entire system is--
3468.76,The number of feedback loops
and,feed-forward loops.
3471.4,I think if you can just
generally,understand
3473.38,that the first half of the
menstrual/ovulatory,cycle
3476.08,is marked by the maturation
of,the follicles and FSH
3478.96,and that the second
half,is marked
3480.82,by the accumulation
of,progesterone
3483.19,and the thickening
of,the uterine lining
3484.87,should fertilization
and,"implantation occur,"
3487.69,I think that you will
certainly,understand
3489.82,the female reproductive
cycle,better than most people
3492.46,out there.
3493.125,It will also help you
understand,a number of things
3495.25,that are sometimes associated
with,the female reproductive
3497.72,cycle.
3498.22,"For instance, there"
are,data showing
3499.72,"that, in many, not all, but"
in,"many women, in the four"
3504.29,to five days prior to
"ovulation,",there is
3507.01,a dramatic increase in libido.
3508.81,That dramatic
increase,in libido is
3510.67,triggered by a number of
"things,",but some of those things
3513.58,include the spike
in,"FSH that occurs,"
3516.1,"the spike in LH that occurs,"
and,some associated increases
3520.51,"in androgens, things like"
DHEA,"and testosterone,"
3524.03,"which, just as in males"
can,"be related to libido,"
3527.74,in females trigger libido.
3529.24,You can imagine why this would
be,an effective mechanism
3531.94,to have in place in females if
the,"goal, as it were, certainly"
3537.07,"of the egg, perhaps not"
of,"the woman as a whole,"
3540.8,but if the goal is to
fertilize,the egg--
3544.06,so increases in
libido,just prior
3545.89,to the onset of ovulation.
3548.41,There's also been a lot
of,discussion and interest
3551.53,"and, frankly, data"
exploring,the malaise
3554.92,that it can occur
at,certain portions
3556.66,of the menstrual cycle.
3558.82,And there's a lot of
misconception,about this.
3561.13,A lot of people have focused
on,the malaise that can occur
3565.75,around the time of bleeding.
3567.73,But there are
actually,stronger data
3570.4,"to support the fact that some,"
"again,","some, not all women"
3574.12,experience a kind of
malaise,sometimes associated
3576.67,"with anxiety, sometimes not,"
that's,associated with the mid
3580.57,to second half of
the,luteal phase
3584.4,of the
ovulatory/menstrual,cycle.
3587.55,"And that, despite what"
people,"commonly think,"
3591.15,is not associated with
elevated,levels of estrogen.
3593.76,It's actually associated with
the,depletion in estrogen
3596.52,levels that can occur
during,certain portions
3599.31,of that second half
of,the luteal phase
3601.89,of the menstrual cycle.
3603.37,"So again, this is"
highly,variable.
3606.81,"For some people, they"
might,not experience
3608.73,any malaise at any point
during,their menstrual cycle.
3611.49,Other individuals
"also,","for instance,"
3613.06,might not experience any
variation,in their libido
3615.44,at any point during
their,menstrual cycle.
3617.19,"Again, highly"
"variable,",and yet there
3618.84,are some statistically
significant,trends
3621.06,that have been
observed,that tracked
3622.8,very specific
hormonal,components
3624.42,within the menstrual cycle.
3625.74,"Again, this will all"
be,very contextual.
3628.62,"And of course, this can play out"
in,a number of different ways.
3631.62,"So for instance, some women"
experience,very heightened
3633.87,levels of sensitivity
to,caffeine
3635.58,at certain portions of
their,menstrual cycle.
3637.65,Other women experience
more,cramping than others
3640.942,at different portions of
their,menstrual cycle.
3642.9,Tremendous variation from
individual,to individual.
3646.2,One of the--
3647.55,I view it as an advantage.
3648.78,But one of the things that
many,females can really do
3653.31,and experience because they have
cycles,that occur every month
3656.1,that are fairly dramatic
in,terms of their levels
3658.8,"of hormones-- so for instance,"
a,"more than 1,000-fold increase"
3662.76,in progesterone during the
luteal,phase of the menstrual
3665.1,"cycle and, I should"
also,"mention,"
3667.11,a 200-fold increase in estrogen
during,the period just prior
3670.35,to ovulation.
3671.16,That's why they always say
estrogen,primes progesterone.
3674.393,That's what you learn in
kind,of basic endocrinology
3676.56,when you're learning
the,menstrual cycle.
3677.86,Estrogen in the first half
of,the menstrual cycle
3679.902,primes progesterone
in,the second half
3681.9,of the
ovulatory/menstrual,cycle.
3684.19,"Well, those estrogen increases"
just,prior to ovulation
3687.93,are in part responsible for
the,increases in libido.
3692.25,But it's also the presence of
increased,androgen just prior
3695.49,to ovulation.
3696.12,So there's a lot of
complex,interplay.
3698.37,I think what we will
do,is we will reserve
3700.5,the discussion about
"libido,","per se,"
3703.41,and some of the
other,aspects related
3704.97,to sexual
differentiation,that we
3706.14,were talking about earlier
for,a future episode.
3708.14,But hopefully now
you,have in mind
3709.74,what the ovulatory/menstrual
cycle,is.
3711.99,It is a signal from the
"brain,","from the hypothalamus,"
3715.42,which then triggers a
signal,"from the pituitary,"
3717.66,"an endocrine gland, which then"
signals,the release of hormones
3722.04,that travel to the
ovary,and that control
3724.59,"two things, maturation of eggs"
and,the identification of one
3728.25,egg in particular and then
preparation,"of the milieu,"
3733.65,the environment in which
that,fertilized egg could
3735.99,potentially land and mature
into,a healthy embryo and child.
3741.13,So if you have that
framed,up in your mind
3743.14,and even if you just
extracted,maybe 10% to 15%
3746.148,of the hormones and
different,aspects
3747.69,"that I described up until now,"
I,would consider you far more
3752.19,knowledgeable about this entire
process,than 99% of people
3756.0,"out there, certainly not"
the,"OB/GYNs and urologists,"
3759.27,but the 99% of
individuals,out there.
3762.49,It also frames up for
us,the second half
3765.57,of this whole story about
fertility,"and fertilization,"
3767.98,which is the generation of sperm
and,how the sperm eventually
3772.74,arrive at the egg and how
certain,sperm are selected
3776.07,to potentially
fertilize,"that egg,"
3778.86,whereas others never
really,stand a chance.
3781.15,So next we're going
to,talk about sperm.
3783.062,We're going to talk
about,"what sperm are,"
3784.77,"where they are generated,"
and,"how they are generated,"
3786.978,and how they need to
travel,both within the male
3789.39,and within the female in
order,to allow fertilization
3792.84,to potentially occur.
3793.92,I'd like to take a
brief,break and thank
3796.35,"our sponsor, InsideTracker."
3798.6,InsideTracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
3801.24,that analyzes data
from,your blood and DNA
3803.67,to help you better
understand,your body
3805.41,and help you reach
your,health goals.
3807.21,I've long been a believer in
getting,regular blood work done
3809.82,for the simple reason that
many,of the factors that impact
3812.772,your immediate and
long-term,health
3814.23,can only be analyzed from
a,quality blood test.
3816.775,The problem with a
lot,of blood and DNA
3818.4,"tests out there, however,"
is,that you get data
3820.59,back about metabolic
"factors,","lipids, and hormones"
3823.4,"and so forth, but you don't"
know,what to do with those data.
3825.9,InsideTracker
solves,that problem
3827.61,and makes it very easy
for,you to understand
3829.8,"what sorts of nutritional,"
"behavioral,",maybe even
3833.4,supplementation-based
interventions,
3835.68,you might want to
take,on in order
3837.36,to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic,"factors, hormones,"
3840.03,"lipids, and other"
things,that impact
3841.74,your immediate and
long-term,health to bring
3843.81,those numbers into the
ranges,that are appropriate
3846.27,and indeed optimal for you.

3858.73,So we've covered the
ovulatory,cycle in females.
3861.69,"And I confess, it was"
a,lot of information
3864.24,with a lot of
biological,nomenclature.
3866.37,But I promise you that
many,of those same themes
3869.13,and indeed the same
names,and nomenclature
3871.92,will show up in the
discussion,that we're
3873.66,"going to have now, which is"
about,the generation of sperm.
3876.52,"Now, sperm are similar"
to,eggs in the sense
3880.452,that they are part
of,the germline.
3881.91,They are these protected
"cells,",protected in the sense
3884.59,that the activities
of,an individual
3887.62,are not going to change the
genetic,makeup of those cells.
3892.07,"Now, again, there are"
instances,in which
3894.22,"mutagens, such as"
"chemicals,",could disrupt
3897.73,the genomes of the germ
cells,"in males, just"
3900.91,as it could in females.
3901.97,"But in general, the"
"activities,",the things
3904.51,"that we do, the"
experiences,"we have,"
3906.61,doesn't tend to change
the,genome of those cells.
3909.41,"However, there are a lot"
of,lifestyle factors--
3911.453,"dos and don'ts, nutrition and"
supplements,and prescription
3913.87,"drugs, et cetera-- that can"
indeed,modify the quality
3917.77,of the sperm.
3918.85,And we'll talk about
what,sperm quality means.
3920.9,But the point is that the sperm
"cell,","much like the egg cell,"
3927.31,are both germline cells.
3928.947,They are not like somatic cells.
3930.28,They are unique populations.
3931.6,And let's just remember what
the,job of the sperm cell is.
3934.48,The job of the sperm cell is
to,deliver the genetic material
3938.2,from the father and to do that
in,the form of a haploid cell.
3942.92,So that means 23
"chromosomes,","22 autosomes,"
3947.74,one so-called sex chromosome--
3950.445,"again, not sex the verb,"
at,least not in this case.
3952.57,"Sex, the verb, is"
a,discussion we're
3954.16,going to have in a few
"minutes,",but sex the noun.
3957.07,The sex chromosome can either
be,an X chromosome or a Y
3960.7,chromosome.
3961.97,So 22 autosomes and
then,one sex chromosome
3964.63,is going to be contained
within,the sperm
3966.91,because it's a haploid
"cell,",not a diploid cell.
3969.1,"Remember, the egg was diploid,"
then,it became haploid.
3971.35,The sperm cells
are,cells that are
3974.617,created through the
division,of other cells.
3976.45,But after that division occurs
through,a process called
3978.88,"meiosis, the sperm cell is"
going,"to contain 23 chromosomes,"
3984.58,consisting of 22 autosomes
and,one sex chromosome.
3987.49,And the sperm that manages
to,deposit its DNA contents
3992.2,"into the egg, to"
fertilize,"the egg,"
3994.18,will either have an X
sex,chromosome or a Y sex
3998.47,chromosome.
3999.19,And the Y sex
chromosome,has a number
4001.56,of different genes on
that,chromosome that
4004.02,"will suppress, for"
"instance,",the development
4006.87,of the female reproductive axis.
4009.39,One good example would be the
MÃ¼llerian-inhibiting,"hormone,"
4012.24,or MIH.
4013.38,The gene for
MÃ¼llerian-inhibiting,"hormone,"
4015.79,which is a hormone that prevents
the,formation of the MÃ¼llerian
4018.78,"ducts, which is part of the"
female,"reproductive structure,"
4022.41,"well, that gene controls the"
prevention,of the development
4027.78,of the female genitalia
and,in doing so promotes
4032.07,the development of
the,male genitalia.
4033.69,And there are other
examples,of genes
4035.01,that are on the Y
chromosome,that give you
4036.9,a what we call male phenotype.
4039.227,You have genotype and phenotype.
4040.56,"By the way, in case you"
haven't,heard this in a while
4042.99,from your high school biology--
4044.04,or if you never heard
"it,",no big deal--
4045.665,karyotype is the
complement,of chromosome--
4049.26,XX or XY.
4050.352,And there are
individuals,out there
4051.81,"that are XXY or XYY, a"
discussion,for our episode
4055.53,on sex differentiation.
4056.76,That's karyotype with a K.
4058.71,"Then there's genotype, which"
are,the genes that you have.
4061.23,"And then there's phenotype,"
spelled,"P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E,"
4066.84,phenotype.
4067.65,And the phenotype
is,"how the genes,"
4071.53,"which then code for RNA,"
which,"code for protein,"
4074.91,how those are expressed in
terms,of things like eye color.
4077.613,So eye color is a phenotype.
4078.78,Height is a phenotype.
4079.8,Hair color is a phenotype.
4080.94,"So you have karyotype,"
"genotype,",and phenotype.
4082.93,"Well, what we need to do is"
we,need to bring together
4085.65,"that sperm, which is"
haploidd,it contains those 23
4088.71,chromosomal strandes--
4090.66,with either an X or
a,Y. Sex chromosome
4093.03,is the 23rd chromosome.
4094.35,We need to get that
cell,to the egg.
4097.899,And so when we talk about
"spermatogenesis,","of course,"
4101.17,we are talking about the
generation,of sperm cells.
4104.069,But what we're really talking
about,is the generation
4106.41,of cells whose job is to deliver
the,genetic material from dad
4110.31,to the egg within the female
in,a way that increases
4115.68,the probability that not only
will,that egg be fertilized
4118.71,but that it will progress in
a,healthy way with each set
4122.88,of chromosomes from
mom,and from dad--
4124.89,each set of 23
"chromosomes,",that is--
4127.56,"will progress in a healthy way,"
will,"implant in a healthy way,"
4131.85,and will maintain and grow in a
healthy,way to a healthy embryo
4136.77,and child and eventually adult.
That's,the job of the sperm.
4141.18,So as we talk about
"spermatogenesis,",
4143.34,let's just remember that
and,why they're there
4146.067,in the first place.
4146.859,"Now, a few things about"
sperm,"that are interesting,"
4149.55,besides the fact
that,they're haploid
4151.62,"and besides the fact that,"
as,"you all know, they swim."
4154.213,They have a head and a tail.
4155.38,"They actually have a head,"
a,"mid region, and a tail,"
4157.547,and that mid region turns
out,to be very important.
4159.729,It's something we'll come
back,to again and again.
4161.812,That mid region is really
key,for the ability for sperm
4164.52,to engage in forward
progression,to swim forward.
4167.7,It involves the activity
of,"mitochondria,"
4170.17,which are involved in
generation,"of ATP, which"
4173.58,is involved in all aspects
of,energy and all cells.
4176.34,But let's just remember that
the,sperm are swimming cells.
4180.149,And in order to create
a,really good swimmer
4183.3,"or set of swimmers, you"
need,a couple of things.
4185.68,"First of all, within the testes"
is,where the sperm develop.
4189.99,And unlike in females
and,"unlike in the ovary,"
4193.56,there's no vault of sperm.
4195.12,The sperm are continually
being,generated.
4197.64,It takes about 60
days,for sperm to be
4200.22,born from their parent cells--
4202.71,because cells actually
give,"rise to other cells,"
4204.76,that's the it works-- to be
born,from their parent cells
4206.79,and then matured to
the,point where they
4208.457,can be a really good swimmer.
4209.67,"Now, that doesn't mean"
that,a bunch of sperm
4213.6,"are made on day one, and then"
60,"days later, all those sperm"
4217.56,are deployed in the
form,"of ejaculate,"
4219.39,and then the cycle
starts,over again.
4221.14,So it's a little different than
the,ovulatory menstrual cycle.
4223.74,"Rather, at any given point"
in,"time-- like right now,"
4226.53,"if you have testes, you have"
some,sperm in your testes that
4229.77,"are immature and cannot swim,"
cannot,deliver those contents
4235.35,to--
4235.95,"those genetic contents,"
rather--,to the female egg.
4238.77,And you have some
sperm,"that are mature,"
4240.51,and you very likely have
some,sperm that are so mature
4243.78,that they are dying off
or,that they're dead.
4246.09,"Almost certainly, also,"
regardless,"of your age,"
4248.73,you have some sperm that are
healthier,"than others, that are"
4251.64,better swimmers than others.
4253.18,This is just the way
the,system works.
4256.15,"Now, the process"
of,spermatogenesis
4259.212,"involves a couple of things,"
but,a lot of the players
4261.42,are the same as the
process,of developing
4263.88,"the so-called oocyte,"
the,immature egg.
4268.18,We've got GnRH from
the,hypothalamus.
4270.523,That's going to be a player.
4271.69,"We have FSH,"
follicle-stimulating,"hormone,"
4273.888,although the name's a little
bit,of a misnomer in the context
4276.43,"of spermatogenesis, because in"
the,"context of spermatogenesis,"
4279.43,there is no follicle.
4280.563,What we're really
talking,about is
4281.98,FSH for stimulating the
maturation,"of the sperm cell,"
4286.31,so not egg follicle
but,sperm cell.
4288.34,"But we still have GnRH,"
"FSH,","LH, and rather"
4292.39,than the ovary being the
target,"of those hormones,"
4294.76,it's going to be the testes.
4296.48,So most everybody should know
that,the testes and the ovaries
4300.4,are the so-called gonads.
4302.83,"The testes, of course,"
reside,outside of the body.
4306.25,There are instances
where,the testes fail
4309.16,to descend during development.
4310.66,"Certainly, if the"
testes,don't descend
4312.57,"on time, that's something that"
doctors,need to be made aware
4315.07,"of, the pediatrician"
should,"be made aware of,"
4316.945,because that can
prevent,fertility.
4320.02,Why would that be?
4321.02,"Well, it turns out"
that,the testes
4323.41,reside outside the
body,in the scrotum
4325.63,because the
temperature,conditions
4328.54,under which
spermatogenesis,can occur
4331.03,and under which healthy
sperm,can be maintained
4334.42,are very restricted and is
approximately,2 degrees cooler
4340.21,than the rest of the body.
4341.99,This is very important.
4343.45,I think this is something that
used,to be discussed a lot more
4346.18,but isn't discussed
so,much these days.
4348.88,But keeping the
testes,cool enough--
4351.053,doesn't necessarily mean keeping
them,"cold, although there"
4353.47,is a place for
using,"cold exposure,"
4355.3,deliberate cold
"exposure,",to improve
4357.7,sperm quality and
number,and perhaps even
4359.89,testosterone levels.
4360.98,We'll talk about that
a,little bit later.
4362.688,But keeping the
testes,about 2 degrees
4366.19,cooler than the rest of
the,body is absolutely key.
4369.2,"If sperm get too hot, they die."
4371.95,"And if spermatocytes, the"
cells,"that give rise to sperm,"
4374.59,"get too warm, well, then"
oftentimes,the sperm
4377.62,that develop are not
"healthy,",not healthy
4380.427,in a number of ways.
4381.26,Either they can't engage in
fast,forward progression--
4384.37,"that is, swimming-- or"
they,will lack the ability
4388.45,to deposit their DNA
contents,within the egg.
4391.36,"So again, whatever is"
contained,in the ejaculate
4394.06,is going to be a mixture of
different,sperm qualities.
4396.31,And sperm of different ages will
impact,"the quality, but also"
4400.78,the temperature under which
those,sperm developed is
4405.13,going to impact their quality.
4406.75,And so we're going to get
into,tools a little bit
4409.27,"later, as I mentioned, but just"
to,give you a simple takeaway.
4412.42,If you are hoping to conceive
in,the next 90 days--
4416.08,the spermatogenesis
cycle,"take 60 days,"
4418.24,but then the sperm actually have
to,migrate from the testicle
4421.63,"into the so-called epididymis,"
which,"is a related structure,"
4425.17,and then into the
vas,deferens and then
4427.33,"into the urethra, where it"
can,be part of the ejaculate.
4429.82,In order for sperm to
do,"all that properly,"
4433.21,undergo that maturation and
then,exit in ejaculate in a way
4436.39,that's healthy or that
the,"sperm is healthy,"
4439.93,if you plan to conceive children
or,to try and conceive children
4443.74,"in the next 90 days, you"
definitely,want to avoid
4446.98,exposing your testicles--
that,"is, your scrotum--"
4450.67,to elevated temperatures.
4453.08,So that means definitely
avoiding,"hot tubs,"
4456.19,definitely avoiding hot baths.
4457.69,"Now, a brief hot bath"
or,hot tub or hot shower
4459.91,isn't going to be a
"problem,",although if you're
4462.448,"really interested in conceiving,"
I,would avoid hot tubs
4464.74,and hot baths as
much,as possible.
4467.47,Hot showers are probably fine.
4469.94,But if you're going to go
into,"a sauna, for instance,"
4472.22,you might want to
rethink,that decision.
4473.887,And if you do decide
"to,",you almost certainly
4475.9,would want to bring a cold
pack,"in that you could-- well,"
4479.17,hopefully put some material
between,the cold pack
4481.27,and the scrotum so you
don't,get a cold burn.
4483.46,"But put something there, but"
keep,the scrotal tissue cool.
4488.17,Keep it cold to cool because
heat,exposure can really
4492.76,mutate and disrupt
the,"developing sperm,"
4495.79,and it can kill sperm.
4497.18,"And so, again, that would"
be,for an entire 90 days
4500.92,leading up to your
attempts,to conceive.
4503.137,"Again, we'll get into more tools"
"later,",but a number of people
4505.72,also have probably heard
of,the boxers versus briefs
4509.53,"controversy, I guess it is,"
or,whether or not people call
4513.94,it going commando with no
underwear,"of any kind-- boxers,"
4518.32,"briefs, briefs, or"
otherwise,rather.
4520.79,It turns out that the data
on,that point to the fact
4523.03,that there isn't really a big
difference,in terms of sperm
4525.64,quality if people
wear,boxers or briefs
4528.91,or don't wear anything under
their,jeans or shorts at all.
4533.5,The scrotum has the ability to
move,the testicles far enough
4537.85,away from the body in
order,to achieve lower
4539.743,temperatures if it needs to.
4540.91,It achieves that
through,a muscle
4542.285,called the cremaster
"muscle,",which
4543.94,is a really interesting
"muscle,",believe it or not.
4546.14,I was reading up on the
biology,of the cremaster
4548.14,"muscle, something"
I,never thought
4549.16,I'd spend too much time on but
that,I ended up spending far
4551.89,too much time reading up about.
4553.393,And it's really fascinating.
4554.56,What you have is a muscle
that,is a smooth muscle
4557.71,"tissue, unlike skeletal muscle,"
which,"is striated muscle,"
4561.46,that is temperature dependent.
4563.12,"So it has certain nerve endings,"
and,it has certain receptors
4566.92,on it that allow it to
respond,to local temperature
4569.41,and then to relax in
order,to essentially let
4573.28,the testicles to descend further
from,the body or to contract
4576.21,and bring the testicles
closer,to the body
4577.96,in order to try and maintain
the,optimal temperature range.
4580.72,And it turns out the cremaster
muscle,can achieve that
4583.215,whether or not people are
wearing,boxers or briefs.
4585.34,Although it stands to
reason,that any kind of--
4589.007,there's no other name for
it--,"undergarments-- you know,"
4591.34,I don't know why that word
just,seems kind of antiquated--
4593.757,but undergarment that allows
some,movement of the scrotum
4597.55,and the testicles should
be,sufficient to allow
4599.62,these temperature variations to
occur,and keep things in range.
4604.0,"That said, a little bit later,"
we'll,"go into some detail,"
4607.18,really--
4607.69,because it's
important--,"as to why,"
4610.09,"for instance, if you are"
somebody,"who has big thighs,"
4612.4,"believe it or not,"
that,it actually
4613.875,can lower sperm count
"substantially,",whether or not
4616.0,the big thighs occur
because,you're very muscular
4618.042,or the big thighs occur
because,you are overweight.
4620.83,It can increase the temperature.
4622.52,If you're sitting
a,"lot, increases"
4624.04,"scrotal temperature, for sure."
4625.655,And there are some other things
that,can increase scrotal
4628.03,"temperature, seat heaters"
in,"cars, for instance--"
4631.18,"terrible idea, just terrible"
idea,if you're hoping
4634.03,to conceive in the near future--
4636.71,"and again, hot tub,"
things,of that sort.
4640.4,So temperature modulation
of,spermatogenesis and sperm
4644.95,quality and function is key.
4646.283,That relates a little
bit,more to tools.
4647.95,But what happens?
4648.76,How does the actual
sperm,develop?
4651.22,"Well, contained"
within,"the testicle,"
4653.47,"you have the cells, the"
so-called,"spermatogonia,"
4656.83,which differentiate into
so-called,spermatocytes.
4658.99,You don't have to
remember,all this.
4660.49,And the spermatocytes undergo
this,process of meiosis.
4663.11,Meiosis is a form of
cell,"division, which"
4665.41,reduces the chromosome number to
those,23 individual strands as
4669.97,opposed to pairs.
4671.08,So it makes them haploid
as,opposed to diploid.
4673.447,"Very, very important for reasons"
that,we talked about earlier.
4676.03,And the meiosis process in
these,"primordial sperm cells,"
4680.68,"these immature sperm cells, is"
similar,to the meiosis process
4684.7,that occurs in eggs when
the,chromosomes segregate in
4687.76,that it involves these
spindle-like,structures
4690.91,within the cell.
4691.61,"Now, why do I keep"
bringing,up the spindles?
4692.98,"Well, it turns out"
that,the function
4694.24,of the spindle in
the,egg and the sperm
4696.1,is heavily dependent on
mitochondrial,function.
4699.41,And later when we get into tools
for,improving egg and sperm
4702.04,"quality, you're going to"
hear,about a lot of tools
4704.123,for improving mitochondria.
4705.28,And it's not just
because,the mitochondria
4707.08,are involved in energy-demanding
aspects,of cell biology.
4711.19,But it's also because the
mitochondria,in this context
4714.19,"are very, very important for"
the,removal of or the separation
4719.65,of one set of
chromosomes,to give you
4721.3,these two sets of haploid
"cells,",the egg and the sperm.
4724.43,And this is so important because
many,"failures at fertilization,"
4729.73,"many failures at implantation,"
"many,","many miscarriages,"
4733.63,and many birth defects that
do,survive after birth that
4737.05,"are very detrimental, such as"
trisomies,"and things like that,"
4741.43,occur because the spindles
don't,effectively pull apart
4745.18,the chromosomes in
typically,"the egg,"
4748.12,but it can also
occur,in the sperm.
4750.71,So the spindles and the
fact,that mitochondria
4752.95,are rich on the spindle are
very,important for generating
4755.47,these haploid sperm--
"again,",23 individual strands
4757.75,of chromosomes.
4759.4,That's occurring
inside,of the testes.
4763.04,So there's not as much
long-distance,migration
4765.88,of the spermatocytes
and,the sperm cells
4769.87,as there is the
egg,just when you
4771.837,think about the overall
architecture,of the uterus
4773.92,and the Fallopian tubes
compared,"to the testicles,"
4775.54,but there's still
a,lot of movement.
4776.69,So within the
"testicle,",if you were
4778.27,to look at the testicle
in,cross-section--
4780.427,and I prefer to call
it,that rather than cut
4782.26,the testicle in half.
4783.1,Any time you talk about
"anatomy,",you actually
4784.45,talk about slicing things.
4785.533,That's what you would do with
a,cadaver is what I teach
4788.53,and we do in my
laboratory,"and, frankly,"
4792.01,in biological laboratories
all,over the place.
4794.3,"But when you talk about it, you"
talk,about if you were to take
4796.883,a visual cross-section
through,"the testicle,"
4798.917,what you would find is that
there,are a lot of different
4801.25,"little tubes, a lot of"
"ducts,","D-U-C-T-S, ducts."
4805.72,Those are pathways.
4806.77,And the main ducts that are
important,for this discussion
4810.55,are called the
seminiferous,tubules.
4813.49,So it's a mesh-like
or,network structure
4816.91,of tubes in the testicle.
4818.53,And the immature sperm sit
on,a little compartment
4823.18,along the edge of those tubes.
4824.81,"And as they mature, they"
move,towards the center
4827.14,of those tubes.
4827.848,And then when they
are,"mature enough,"
4829.39,those sperm cells actually drop
into,"the hollow of the tube,"
4833.38,and then can travel
through,those tubes
4835.78,to a structure that's along
the,side of the testicle called
4840.4,the epididymis.
4842.2,"The epididymis, again,"
is,a series of ducts.
4845.02,And then the epididymis
converges,with something
4847.87,called the vas deferens.
4849.937,"I think in high school,"
we,all remember this
4851.77,by thinking about it's
the,vast difference.
4853.6,I don't know who
came,up with that.
4855.37,I think it was a
young,girl sitting
4857.182,to the left of me that
was,"like, oh, it's"
4858.89,like the vast difference.
4859.63,I never forgot that.
4860.45,I don't know.
4860.59,Maybe it was the topic matter.
4861.52,Maybe it was her.
4862.03,Maybe it was some
combination,of the two.
4863.738,"But in any case, the sperm"
go,from the seminiferous
4865.9,tubules to the
epididymis,and then
4869.15,to the vas deferens and then
are,"contained in the ejaculate,"
4872.72,along with seminal fluid.
4874.7,"Now, the seminal fluid"
is,the carrier fluid
4878.63,for the sperm themselves.
4881.427,This is important
because,it turns out
4883.01,that a lot of things that can
both,negatively or positively
4886.16,impact the quality of the
sperm,relates not just
4889.46,to the sperm cells themselves
and,the temperature
4891.89,of the environment that
they,"were matured in,"
4895.31,but also to the semen quality.
4898.37,"For instance, if you are a heavy"
"drinker,","if you are a smoker,"
4903.89,or if you are a regular
user,"of cannabis,"
4907.7,especially if you smoke
cannabis,"or vape cannabis,"
4911.33,you create a lot of
reactive,oxygen species
4914.66,that disrupt the chemistry
of,"the seminal fluid, which"
4917.81,disrupts the sperm cells.
4919.14,So it's not a direct action
always,on the sperm cell
4921.53,"itself, although it can be."
4922.77,"So for instance, in the form"
of,"smoked tobacco or cannabis,"
4927.418,there are a lot of
carcinogens,and mutagens
4929.21,"that actually mutate the DNA,"
can,"cause DNA fragmentation,"
4932.33,and debilitate sperm.
4933.53,But there are also a lot of
things,created by smoking
4937.94,"in particular, regardless"
of,"what's being smoked,"
4940.91,that can create elevated
reactive,oxygen species
4944.15,and disrupt the seminal fluid
that,the sperm are contained
4948.77,in in the so-called
"ejaculate,",the semen.
4951.23,"Now, this will also become a"
relevant,conversation later
4955.01,when we briefly talk
about,vasectomies.
4957.56,Vasectomies are
literally,a cutting
4961.4,"of the vas deferens, which"
leads,"to a situation,"
4965.06,provided the surgery
was,"done correctly,"
4966.89,where men can still achieve
all,the other aspects
4970.435,of intercourse.
4971.06,They can still achieve erection.
4973.07,They can still achieve orgasm.
4974.93,They can still ejaculate.
4977.18,"But when they ejaculate, the"
seminal,"fluid is released,"
4980.28,but there are no sperm contained
within,the seminal fluid.
4982.82,And it turns out
that,vasectomies
4984.77,are a very effective
form,of birth control.
4987.41,And they always check
to,see if zero sperm
4989.9,and confirm that
zero,sperm are being
4991.457,released in the ejaculate.
4992.54,They are reversible.
4993.985,"And that is, vasectomies are"
"reversible,",but not always.
4997.73,There are a subset of cases
where,"it's not reversible,"
4999.98,in which case if people
still,"want to have children,"
5002.147,you have to go in and actually
surgically,extract sperm
5005.35,from the testicles.
5006.61,But it's a process in which
the,vas deferens is altered
5012.01,or severed in a way that
the,sperm can't actually
5014.29,exit the testicle.
5015.96,They can get into the
"epididymis,","usually,"
5017.71,but not into the vas deferens
and,so on and so forth.
5021.182,So if you've ever wondered
what,"a vasectomy is,"
5023.14,that's what a vasectomy is.
5024.34,And I mentioned vasectomy
now,because it illustrates
5028.833,the difference between the
seminal,"fluid, the semen,"
5031.0,and the sperm that
the,semen contain.
5034.24,So 60 days to generate the
"sperm,",another two weeks
5039.01,or so for the sperm to travel
through,the various ducts
5042.16,to the point where they can
be,contained in the ejaculate.
5045.19,Let's talk about the
sperm,cells themselves.
5047.95,"The sperm cells, again,"
have,these 23 pairs
5052.18,of single-strand chromosomes.
5053.89,They're haploid.
5054.92,They have either an X
or,a Y sex chromosome
5056.83,as the 23rd so-called
sex,chromosome.
5059.11,"And as we all know,"
they,have a head.
5061.0,The head tends to be
oval,in most cases.
5064.19,The head contains very
important,enzymes and proteins
5067.72,that are designed to fuse
with,the much larger egg
5070.99,and to actually take the
membrane,of the sperm cell
5073.57,and combine to actually mesh
with,the egg cell's membrane
5080.58,and then deliver the genetic
contents,"to the egg cell,"
5084.7,"in other words, to"
fertilize,the egg cell.
5086.88,"Now, just behind the head is a"
region,called the mid region.
5090.48,That mid region is a
slightly,thickened region.
5094.29,"And here, of course, I'm"
talking,about healthy sperm cell
5097.08,morphology.
5097.68,Morphology simply means shape.
5099.33,A mid region-- that
mid,region has a bunch
5102.45,of things related
to,cell motility
5104.58,and to the forward
progression,of the cells.
5107.56,"First of all, it is chock a"
block,full of mitochondria.
5110.555,"In fact, if you"
were,to look just
5111.93,behind the head of the
"sperm,",what you'd see
5114.24,is that it is completely
surrounded,by mitochondria.
5118.647,There are mitochondria elsewhere
in,"the cell, but most of them"
5121.23,are contained in this
mid,region compartment
5123.063,just behind the
head,of the sperm.
5125.97,And that thick region is where
the,"tail movement of the sperm,"
5130.65,"the flagellation back and forth,"
is,actually generated from.
5137.85,Much like if you were to
hold,"a rope, like a battle"
5140.73,"rope in the gym, and you"
were,"to whip the battle rope,"
5145.02,the whip at the
one,end of the rope
5147.09,is what allows for the sort
of--,let's just call it
5152.16,what it is-- the
curves,"in the rope,"
5153.87,"the oscillations, the"
rising,and falling
5155.73,of the rope all the
way,out to the end.
5157.77,It is the force of the whip
right,at that end that with
5162.645,the battle rope you're
doing,with your hand--
5164.52,"and with the sperm, that is"
occurring,just behind the head
5167.46,of the sperm--
5168.3,that is actually going
to,dictate how fast
5171.66,and how well that
sperm,can swim.
5174.15,"And indeed, the sperm"
has,to swim very far.
5176.7,How far?
5177.51,"Well, on a relative scale--"
5179.34,"and again, these are estimations"
because,they're going to be--
5182.82,how should we say?
5183.75,There will be differences
in,the distance
5186.9,from the head of the penis and
where,the ejaculation occurs
5193.02,"to the cervix, depending"
on,the relative size
5195.78,of the vaginal canal
and,the penis that
5198.27,delivers the ejaculate
to,the vaginal canal.
5200.22,But once the sperm arrive
at,"the cervix, which"
5204.57,is at the back of
the,vaginal canal
5207.42,just at the opening
to,"the uterus,"
5209.34,once the sperm arrive
"there,",the distance
5212.94,from the cervix to
the,"egg, of course,"
5215.88,will vary depending
on,where that egg is
5218.01,in its ovulatory
"trajectory,",its pathway.
5220.92,"But it is akin, if"
you,"scale for size,"
5224.43,to the distance between Los
Angeles,"and San Francisco,"
5228.91,"which is many, many"
hundreds,of miles.
5230.55,So those sperm have
to,swim very far.
5232.71,"Now, of course, if the sperm are"
delivered,in the vaginal canal
5236.1,"somewhat further away, they"
will,have further to go.
5239.015,If they're delivered right
at,"the cervical opening,"
5241.14,they will have less far to go.
5242.82,The very effective swimming
sperm,swim very fast.
5247.6,So they are able to
accomplish,that distance
5249.72,in just a few days.
5250.92,And this relates to
a,discussion that we
5254.04,will get into in
a,lot more detail
5255.84,later as to how often couples
should,have intercourse
5259.74,if they're trying to conceive.
5261.313,"Many people might think,"
"well,",it's every day.
5263.23,"However, the more frequent"
the,"ejaculation, the lower"
5266.28,the concentration of
sperm,in each ejaculate.
5269.04,So this is not a
discussion,about how often
5271.11,to have intercourse depending
to,"your preferences,"
5273.57,for pleasure or bonding
or,whatever reason.
5275.76,This is a discussion about
how,often to have intercourse
5278.61,in order to optimize the
probability,of fertilization
5282.03,of the egg.
5282.81,There's some general rules
"that,","of course, come to mind,"
5285.52,which is ejaculations close
to,"ovulation-- both before,"
5290.35,"during, or sometimes after--"
5292.83,are obviously advantageous.
5295.65,But you will also hear
OB/GYNs,and urologist
5298.62,suggesting intercourse
every,other day
5301.29,leading up to the
day,"of ovulation,"
5304.02,starting about three
to,four days out
5306.54,from the day of ovulation.
5308.34,So we got a little
bit,"sidetracked,"
5310.17,"albeit I think appropriately so,"
in,focusing on fertilization.
5314.598,But what we were talking
about,right up until the point
5316.89,of that is the anatomy
of,"the sperm itself,"
5319.84,"which is the head,"
the,mid region that
5321.45,contains all those
"mitochondria,",and then the tail.
5324.28,"Now, what we haven't discussed"
is,the actual generation
5327.75,of the sperm.
5328.54,So if you're a male
or,"if you're a female,"
5331.57,I think it's really
important,to understand
5333.57,how spermatogenesis works.
5336.81,Spermatogenesis works
in,much in the same way
5340.05,that the generation and
maturation,"of eggs work,"
5343.578,"although, as I"
mentioned,"before, it's"
5345.12,going to occur ongoing
throughout,the cycle
5348.69,of the male's life
after,puberty.
5351.63,We already talked about
"puberty,",and I'll just
5354.27,cover this in two
or,three sentences
5356.1,as it relates to males.
5357.48,And it's essentially
the,same thing.
5361.35,"The hypothalamus, up until"
the,"point of puberty,"
5364.35,is providing suppression
of,the release
5367.62,of gonadotropin-releasing
hormone.,
5369.18,"Then some biological clock,"
which,is still not clearly
5373.32,understood-- it's probably not
leptin,coming from body fat.
5378.09,"Again, unlike in the female,"
it's,probably not leptin
5380.805,coming from body fat.
5381.68,But some other signal
arrives,"to the hypothalamus,"
5384.92,removes that
"inhibition,","and GnRH,"
5386.87,gonadotropin-releasing
"hormone,",is now
5388.85,released onto the pituitary.
5390.5,A bunch of hormones are
deployed,from the pituitary
5392.87,as a consequence.
5393.66,The two most important ones for
the,context of this discussion
5396.59,are follicle-stimulating
hormone,and luteinizing hormone.
5400.29,Follicle-stimulating hormone
and,luteinizing hormone
5402.6,travel to the
"testes,",and they're
5405.35,going to do two main things.
5406.77,"One, they're going to trigger"
the,production of testosterone.
5410.09,And they're going to
trigger,the production
5412.37,of the sperm themselves.
5413.78,They're going to set in
"motion,",for essentially
5415.88,the rest of the life of the
"male,",the production of sperm.
5420.47,They're going to initiate
the,"spermatogenesis cycle,"
5422.69,and that cycle is
going,to be ongoing
5424.232,at various stages
for,different sperm
5426.32,for the rest of the man's life.
5428.99,This is very different than
the,triggering of development
5433.76,"of oocytes and eggs in females,"
where,there's an existing
5437.6,vault. That vault can be
depleted,to the point of zero
5440.345,where it can't occur again.
5441.47,Men can generate sperm
their,entire lifetime.
5443.87,"Of course, there's"
a,diminishment
5445.52,of sperm production in
"very,","very late age,"
5448.88,"say, 80s and 90s or 100s."
5450.26,"But believe it or not, there"
are,still sperm being produced.
5452.76,The quality of those
sperm,is another question.
5455.03,So everything we're
going,to talk about now
5457.16,is essentially puberty onward.
5459.95,"Prior to that,"
testicles,"are present,"
5462.35,but they're not
generating,sperm.
5464.63,"Ejaculation isn't possible,"
or,"if it is possible,"
5467.36,it's very unlikely and
"unusual,",and it's not
5470.12,going to contain sperm.
5472.93,Everything we're going
to,talk about now
5474.73,"is puberty forward, so puberty"
onward,to the rest of life.
5480.25,And luteinizing hormone
secreted,from the pituitary acts
5484.63,on the testes and on a
very,specific cell type
5487.93,in the testes called the Leydig
egg,"cells, or Leydig cells,"
5490.66,"L-E-Y-D-I-G, the Leydig cells."
5493.0,The Leydig cells of the testes
are,what produce testosterone.
5497.74,Testosterone is going to
have,two major effects.
5501.56,And here I mean really
major,because it
5503.29,"has many, many hundreds of"
effects,on different tissues
5505.63,of the body.
5506.18,"In fact, that's the definition"
of,"a hormone, really."
5508.347,It's a substance that acts
in,an endocrine fashion.
5511.09,It can act on the very
tissue,that generated it.
5513.46,"So for instance, testosterone"
made,by the Leydig cells
5515.74,within the testes will
act,"on the testes,"
5517.3,as we'll talk about in a moment.
5518.633,But it can also act
on,other tissues.
5521.0,It can act on the
pharynx,and larynx
5522.5,"and deepen the voice, as"
it,does during puberty.
5524.5,It can act on the hair follicles
and,generate facial hair.
5526.93,It can act on the musculature
and,generate protein synthesis
5530.782,and development of
"muscle,","bone, et"
5532.24,"cetera, all the"
things,we associate
5533.698,with puberty and with
testosterone,typically.
5537.41,Restricting the conversation
to,the effects of testosterone
5540.29,on the testicle itself
and,"on spermatogenesis,"
5543.2,the Leydig cells
make,testosterone.
5545.66,And keep in mind that
some,of that testosterone
5547.945,will travel
elsewhere,in the body
5549.32,and do its thing
for,gene expression
5551.48,and the more acute effects
of,testosterone on the brain
5554.12,included.
5555.68,But the testosterone
within,the testes
5557.9,is at extremely
high,concentration.
5560.67,"In fact, the concentration of"
intratesticular,testosterone
5564.83,is at least 100 times higher
than,the concentration
5567.97,of testosterone anywhere
else,"in the body,"
5569.72,even though it's being secreted
into,the rest of the body.
5572.828,And that's because
there,are a number
5574.37,of different so-called
binding,proteins and enzymes
5577.64,that sequester the
testosterone,within the testes.
5580.467,So the Leydig cells are
making,"testosterone,"
5582.3,and a lot of that
testosterone,is acting on
5584.84,and is restricted to the testes.
5586.58,And that turns out to be very
important,because testosterone
5591.41,within the testes
acts,in concert
5594.53,with a different biological
program,"that starts with FSH,"
5598.16,"follicle-stimulating hormone,"
that,also travels to the testes
5601.37,and acts on a very specific
set,of cells that are called
5605.45,"supporting cells or,"
more,"specifically,"
5607.82,the Sertoli cells.
5609.92,The Sertoli cells
are,the cells that
5612.53,"generate something called ABP,"
or,androgen-binding protein.
5616.46,And it is the combination of
testosterone,from the Leydig
5619.7,cells and ABP from
the,Sertoli cells
5623.06,that is necessary
for,spermatogenesis.
5626.66,It's necessary for
those,spermatocytes
5629.24,to become what will eventually
be,"healthy, mature sperm that"
5632.96,have really nice shaped oval
"heads,","have a mid region,"
5636.23,chock a block
through,"mitochondria,"
5637.73,and can generate a fast
whipping,motion of the tail
5640.34,"to swim from the cervix, or"
up,"the vagina into the cervix,"
5644.18,and from the cervix to the
egg,to fertilize the egg.
5647.78,So it's really a basic set
of,chemical players that are
5650.69,involved here and
so,"basic, in fact,"
5653.67,that if you were to disrupt any
one,of these chemical players--
5656.48,either the luteinizing
"hormone,","the FSH,"
5659.115,the testosterone from
the,"Leydig cells,"
5660.74,or androgen-binding protein--
5663.05,you would observe
pretty,marked disruption
5667.61,in spermatogenesis or the
elimination,of sperm entirely.
5671.07,We'll get into a few
deficits,in sperm development
5673.76,and sperm number and sperm
function,a little bit later.
5676.08,But just keep in mind--
5677.78,"or I should say, maybe"
sit,back and just
5679.76,appreciate that the exact
same,players generate
5682.57,"from the hypothalamus,"
which,causes luteinizing
5685.46,hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone,released
5688.16,"from the pituitary, which"
travels,"to the gonad, which"
5691.4,in this case is the
"testicle,",which triggers
5693.95,the release of
testosterone,from Leydig
5695.63,"cells, which triggers the"
action,"of the supporting cells,"
5700.13,"the Sertoli cells, which make"
androgen-binding,protein.
5703.49,Testosterone and
androgen-binding,protein
5705.23,combine and create a
chemical,and actually
5708.62,a structural milieu in which
those,little spermatocytes
5712.31,can go from the
"walls,",from literally
5714.95,the walls of the tubes of
the,"seminiferous tubules,"
5717.53,"can mature into healthy,"
well-developed,"sperm,"
5719.84,and can hop into those
"ducts,","those little tubes,"
5723.11,and then head off to the
"epididymis,",where they will
5725.9,reside-- the epididymis is the
tissue,nearby the testicles
5729.08,or surrounding one
portion,of the testicle--
5731.16,and then eventually fuse
with,"the vas deferens,"
5733.94,can combine with or be
contained,"with, rather,"
5736.88,"the seminal fluid, and then can"
be,ejaculated via the urethra
5741.41,"into the female,"
where,then they can
5743.06,"swim very quickly, effectively"
the,"distance, for them anyway,"
5746.84,from Los Angeles
to,"San Francisco,"
5748.94,over the course of a very
short,"period of time,"
5751.49,and fertilize the egg.
5753.71,So that's the process of
"spermatogenesis,",the maturation
5756.65,"of sperm, which is ongoing"
throughout,the lifespan
5760.19,from puberty onward.
5761.66,"And in doing so, we talked about"
some,of the hormonal elements--
5764.54,coming from the hypothalamus
and,"coming from the pituitary,"
5767.66,and within the testes themselves
the,"Leydig cells, which"
5770.54,"produce testosterone,"
the,"Sertoli cells,"
5772.32,which are the support cells that
allow,spermatogenesis to occur.
5777.95,"With that in mind,"
next,I'd like to think
5780.32,about what's actually contained
in,the ejaculate in terms
5783.02,of numbers of sperm and
what's,really being selected
5786.163,for in terms of the sperm
that,actually successfully
5788.33,fertilizes the egg and
what,sorts of elements
5790.88,come into play in dictating
whether,or not fertilization
5794.48,will or won't occur.
5795.87,And the major themes that
we're,going to discuss
5797.93,are frequency of
"ejaculation,",but really
5801.02,that's just kind of a proxy
for,talking about maximizing
5804.59,sperm concentration and quality
of,sperm arriving at the egg--
5808.94,"because, remember, ovulation"
and,the menstrual cycle
5811.28,are really about creating the
opportunity,for fertilization.
5815.58,And we are also going
to,talk about how
5818.03,"the vaginal duct,"
the,"vagina, and"
5821.72,the milieu around the cervix
and,some other elements
5824.96,within the female
herself,contribute to
5828.41,and support the sperm in
their,journey to the egg
5831.518,and in the likelihood that
they,will fertilize the egg.
5833.81,So really what we need to talk
about,first is sperm quality.
5837.29,And we should also probably
talk,"about ejaculate quality,"
5840.68,"because, as odd as"
that,"theme might seem,"
5844.82,really the ejaculate
"quality,",which
5847.998,has a number of
different,"parameters,"
5849.54,including the number
of,mature sperm
5852.62,that are not so mature that
they're,swimming slower
5854.78,"or are dead, but also"
quality,of sperm.
5856.56,"They have, for"
"instance,",one tail.
5857.977,It's not entirely
uncommon,to see sperm
5860.3,with two tails because they
just,didn't form properly
5863.06,or sperm that are
not,moving very much.
5865.79,"In fact, sperm motility is"
scored,"along a scale of 0,"
5868.99,"1, 2, or 3, 3 being the best,"
fast,forward progressing.
5872.99,0 is not moving at all.
5874.94,"1, they're actually"
called,twitchers.
5877.382,Twitchers are sperm that
sort,of just twitch in place
5879.59,but don't undergo
forward,progression.
5881.99,2 is somewhere in between
1,"and 3, not surprisingly."
5886.82,"Different clinics, different"
"OB/GYNs,",different urologists
5890.825,will throw out
different,numbers.
5892.2,"But in general, it is hoped"
that,more than 50% of the sperm
5897.62,should be motile in some way
or,"another, so not scoring a 0,"
5900.47,"but a 1, or 2, or ideally a 3."
5903.62,The concentration of sperm--
5905.36,"of course, if it's higher within"
the,"ejaculate, the total number"
5910.43,of sperm per milliliter of
"ejaculate,","if that's higher,"
5913.76,then there's a
higher,probability
5915.29,that one of those sperm
will,fertilize the egg.
5918.32,One thing I didn't
mention,before when
5920.0,discussing the production
of,eggs and ovulation--
5922.058,and I probably should
"have,",so I will
5923.6,now-- is that most
often,only one
5926.48,ovary gives rise to
an,ovulating egg.
5931.06,"It happens, but it's somewhat"
rare,"for two mature eggs, one"
5937.7,"from each ovary, to be deployed"
during,a single ovulation.
5940.965,There's a name for that when it
occurs,and both are fertilized.
5943.59,It's called fraternal twins.
5946.19,If a single egg--
5948.11,"that, of course, comes"
from,a single ovary--
5950.24,is fertilized and
the,egg splits--
5954.052,and that's something that
happens,further along
5956.01,in the process of fertilization
and,differentiation
5959.28,of the embryo--
5960.07,"well, then what you get"
are,identical twins.
5963.18,There are other instances that
are,quite uncommon in which
5966.457,you can get fraternal twins
through,other circumstances.
5968.79,"But in general, that's"
the,way it works.
5970.457,But essentially what
happens,is one egg
5972.33,from one ovary-- that's
the,most common occurrence.
5974.7,"The sperm, once ejaculated"
into,"the vaginal duct,"
5978.81,are going to pass
through,the cervix
5982.38,and then are going to
swim,toward the egg.
5984.57,The egg could be at
varying,locations
5987.9,along the female
reproductive,axis.
5990.66,"Now, this is actually"
a,very important thing
5992.88,and actually gets right down
to,the safety of both the
5996.645,potentially developing
embryo,and the mother.
5998.52,There is something referred
to,"as ectopic pregnancy,"
6001.19,and that's when the
pregnancy,actually occurs
6004.34,within the Fallopian tubes.
6005.84,So the precise location
in,which fertilization
6008.36,between the sperm and the
egg,occurs can vary somewhat.
6011.27,"But ideally, the fertilized egg"
implants,into the endometrium
6015.17,or the endometrial
lining,of the uterus
6017.33,and develops there as opposed
to,"within the Fallopian tubes,"
6020.58,which is so-called
ectopic,pregnancy.
6022.28,"Now, where the sperm"
and,the egg meet exactly
6025.94,"can vary, as I mentioned before."
6027.95,"But in general, the"
faster,swimming sperm
6030.83,and the more far along the
ovulatory,trajectory the egg
6034.82,"are, the higher the probability"
of,a successful fertilization
6038.03,because of the proximity
to,the implantation zone
6040.61,of the uterus.
6041.46,So basically it's all
a,probabilities game.
6043.82,It's a probabilities
game,related
6045.41,to the number of sperm
cells,that encounter the egg
6047.69,and where the egg is in
terms,of its ovulatory cycle
6050.42,and also its position where
it,is in the ovulatory cycle.
6055.28,The sperm parameters--
or,I should
6058.01,say the semen parameters--
and,ejaculate parameters
6061.07,that most clinicians
want,"to see,"
6063.29,if you were to give
a,"sperm sample,"
6065.24,would be somewhere in excess of
15,million sperm per milliliter
6071.3,of ejaculate.
6072.92,"Now, there's a lot of"
discussion,nowadays.
6075.11,It seems to be a very
popular,news theme
6077.15,to talk about diminishing
sperm,"counts, the idea that 100"
6081.65,years ago or maybe even 35 years
"ago,",the typical male ejaculate
6085.25,contained 100 million
sperm,"per milliliter,"
6088.01,and nowadays it's down
to,15 to 20 or 50.
6091.04,"And indeed, sperm counts"
do,seem to be declining.
6094.47,And the exact reasons
for,that are not clear.
6096.77,I confess I'm a little bit
reluctant,to talk about this
6099.062,because there have been a lot
of,back and forth discussions
6102.08,"about the safety of EMFs,"
of,"electromagnetic fields,"
6104.725,and it's not exactly what
we're,talking about here.
6106.85,But there are some
excellent,data
6109.13,contained in
meta-analyses,and reviews
6110.72,that I will provide links
to,and that we'll talk about
6112.97,in more detail in a
minute,that correlate
6117.0,the advent of smartphones
and,in particular caring
6119.73,of smartphones in the pocket
with,diminishing sperm counts.
6123.3,Although there are certain
to,be other factors that
6126.0,can explain diminishing
sperm,counts as well.
6128.49,"Dr. Shanna Swan, for instance,"
has,done beautiful work
6132.51,describing how the
phthalates,and the BPAs
6136.26,and so-called
endocrine,disruptors
6138.12,might be disrupting
some,of the milieu
6139.89,of the seminiferous tubules.
6142.15,So this would be reductions in
testosterone,and/or disruptions
6144.96,to the Sertoli cells and
androgen-binding,protein
6147.12,brought about by endocrine
disruptors,such as phthalates
6149.82,contained in pesticides and
contained,on printed receipts
6152.69,and things of that sort.
6153.69,There are some data
that,that is negatively
6155.97,impacting sperm counts.
6158.97,How much so is still debatable.
6162.61,There are also quite
good,data pointing
6164.77,to the fact that
both,the heat-related
6167.43,and the non-heat-related impact
of,smartphones and laptops
6172.5,contained on the lap are
impacting,sperm count
6175.58,and in a negative way.
6177.202,"Again, there's going to"
be,tremendous variation
6179.16,in the concentration
of,sperm from one
6180.842,individual to the next.
6181.8,It will vary according to age
and,a number of other factors
6184.74,that we'll talk about
a,little bit later.
6187.23,"But in general, if somebody"
is,"wishing to conceive,"
6190.26,then clinicians like to
see,a ejaculate volume
6193.89,of more than 2 milliliters.
6196.72,So ejaculate volume
can,be anywhere
6198.87,from 1.5 to 5 milliliters.
6202.57,And that will
strongly,be determined
6204.15,by how frequent
ejaculation,is occurring.
6207.16,There's a lot that goes
into,evaluating the quality
6209.43,of ejaculate and sperm.
6210.78,But basically these huge
variations,that are observed
6215.36,of anywhere from 15 million
sperm,per milliliter
6218.523,"or, in some males who are not"
producing,sperm for whatever
6220.94,reason-- we'll talk about
those,reasons in a little bit--
6224.42,as low as 5 million
sperm,"per milliliter,"
6227.402,all the way up to
100,or maybe even
6228.86,200 million sperm
per,milliliter.
6231.2,Huge variation-- the cause
of,which is not always clear
6236.06,but is certainly
determined,in part
6238.52,by the frequency of ejaculation.
6240.54,So because there are
so,many variables
6243.14,impacting why one male
versus,another male or even
6246.38,the same male
across,the lifespan
6247.79,might have variations in
his,concentration of sperm
6250.73,"within the ejaculate, let's talk"
for,a second about frequency
6254.87,of ejaculation as it relates
to,"the goal of fertility,"
6257.325,"per se, because that's really"
what,today's episode is all
6259.7,about.
6260.28,So what I'd like
to,talk about next
6261.8,is how people can
increase,the probability
6264.38,of a successful
"fertilization,",focusing
6266.54,both on the components
from,the male side
6269.39,and from the female side.
6270.62,And I'm mainly going to couch
this,discussion in the context
6273.47,of the so-called natural
method,of sexual intercourse
6276.8,and ejaculation in
"vivo,",within the female.
6281.39,But I will also touch
on,some parallel themes
6283.7,as it relates to
in-vitro,fertilization
6285.68,and intrauterine insemination.
6288.17,So the idea here is that
we,want the maximum number
6292.73,of high-quality sperm--
that,"is, rapidly forward,"
6295.67,motile sperm that are of
the,correct morphology--
6298.35,"that is, shape."
6299.6,That's going to require
a,lot of mitochondria
6302.27,"in the mid region,"
a,well-shaped head--
6304.49,so it's going to be
an,oval-shaped head.
6306.17,The tail is going to be a
single,"tail, not multiple tails."
6308.84,These aren't going to be
the,twitcher type of--
6311.36,or immotile type of sperm that
are,either twitching in place
6314.6,or aren't moving forward.
6315.68,All of those
components,are going
6317.69,to be essential for
increasing,the probability
6320.48,of fertilization.
6321.29,"But of course, there's"
the,"female side of it,"
6323.165,"too, which is that"
ovulation,occurs
6325.1,on just one day during the
menstrual,ovulatory cycle.
6328.76,And that egg will be
available,for fertilization
6331.49,for approximately 24 hours.
6333.5,"Now, keep in mind that"
the,sperm can survive
6335.93,within the vaginal duct
and,within the area
6338.81,around the cervix
and,within the uterus
6340.76,and along the female
reproductive,tract for anywhere
6344.06,from three to five
or,it's even been
6346.13,described as up to seven days.
6347.85,"But generally, it's going to"
be,about three to five days.
6350.42,"Now, most women can figure"
out,the day of their ovulation
6354.2,by counting the total number
of,days of their typical cycle.
6357.2,And this is where
it's,really useful
6358.7,to have a cycle that's of
more,or less regular duration
6362.33,"or, rather, of more or"
less,regular length.
6365.54,So as we talked about
"earlier,",if somebody's cycle
6368.54,is 21 days or 25 days and it's
21,or 25 days consistently
6372.47,or even 30 days
"consistently,",that's
6374.72,going to be a far better
scenario,to favor fertilization
6377.6,than if it's 20 days
one,month and then 21
6380.87,"days the next month, but then"
suddenly,30 days and then
6383.87,suddenly 35 days.
6385.01,Those varying durations
of,the ovulatory cycle
6388.16,"make it very hard,"
"obviously,",to time
6390.47,and understand when
ovulation,is going to occur.
6392.76,So regular duration
ovulatory,cycles
6396.74,"are the ideal circumstance, and"
they're,"the ideal circumstance,"
6399.77,because even though
the,egg is only
6401.24,available for fertilization
for,"a few days,"
6403.032,those sperm can survive for
some,"period of time, which"
6406.16,leads to the issue of
how,often should couples
6409.7,be having intercourse.
6411.08,"And here, I'm"
referring,specifically
6413.09,to intercourse with ejaculation.
6414.53,How often should couples
be,having intercourse
6416.66,around the time of ovulation
if,the specific goal is
6420.95,successful fertilization of the
egg,and the creation of a baby?
6425.09,This is leaving aside all
"issues,","which, of course, are"
6428.72,"interesting issues, related"
to,how often people are having
6431.69,"intercourse, whether or"
not,there's ejaculation
6433.97,every time they have intercourse
or,"not, for sake of pleasure"
6436.67,or for sake of pair
bonding,and pleasure
6439.49,or for sake of any number
of,other potential goals
6442.1,of intercourse.
6442.91,Here I'm only referring
to,intercourse
6444.92,as it relates to the goal
of,fertilization of the egg.
6449.36,So knowing what we know about
spermatogenesis,and the fact
6455.39,that ejaculate is going to
contain,a certain concentration
6459.05,of sperm but that within that
ejaculate,some of the sperm
6462.83,will be older and less healthy
and,some will be optimally
6466.63,mature and some might
even,be a little bit
6468.38,immature-- although there's a
tendency,for the immature sperm
6470.922,to not have yet exited the
seminiferous,"tubules, gone"
6475.16,into the epididymis
and,vas deferens.
6476.87,But given that the
ejaculate,contains
6478.58,sperm of varying ages and
therefore,varying quality
6482.27,and given that with each
successive,ejaculation
6485.18,in a short period
of,time there's
6487.46,going to be a decrease in
the,concentration of sperm
6490.43,per milliliter of
"semen,","of ejaculate,"
6493.94,we can make some
good,arguments as
6496.31,to how often couples
should,have intercourse
6499.28,with ejaculation around
the,time of ovulation
6501.92,if the goal is to fertilize.
6503.3,If ovulation occurs
"on,","for instance,"
6505.07,day 14 of a cycle--
and,here we're
6506.69,using the kind of
standard,average
6508.28,of 28 days of the cycle.
6510.0,But for some people
with,"a 30-day cycle,"
6512.73,"it could be day 15, or"
with,"a shorter cycle,"
6516.21,it could be day
"12,",for instance.
6517.92,But given a 28-day
average,"cycle,"
6520.26,let's say ovulation occurs
on,day 13 or on day 14.
6524.28,"And typically, it would occur"
on,day 14 of a 28-day cycle.
6528.21,"Well, then, given how long"
sperm,can survive inside
6532.35,"of the woman, you might think"
that,the optimal strategy would
6535.02,be to have as much intercourse
with,ejaculation in the three
6538.92,or four days leading
up,"to ovulation, hope"
6541.89,that those sperm have swam
as,far as they possibly
6544.29,can and will encounter the
egg,just as soon as possible
6546.96,after it ovulates.
6548.37,It turns out that's not
the,optimal strategy.
6550.32,The optimal strategy is really
to,maximize the concentration
6553.83,of healthy sperm
within,each ejaculate
6556.62,and to really center that
around,the day of ovulation.
6559.98,So what this involves
generally,and what
6562.56,the typical recommendation is
is,to abstain from intercourse
6567.06,with ejaculation
about,two or three
6569.7,days out from ovulation
and,"then, on the day"
6573.36,prior to ovulation and
on,"the day of ovulation,"
6577.32,to essentially
introduce,as much semen
6580.95,and ejaculate into the
reproductive,pathway
6583.23,of the female as possible.
6585.97,"Now, that's the"
general,recommendation
6587.73,that the OB/GYNs and the
urologists,that I spoke to
6590.79,gave.
6591.63,But you will also hear
a,different strategy.
6594.12,It's only slightly different.
6595.44,But the different
strategy,involves
6597.6,trying to maximize the
concentration,of healthy sperm
6600.857,within each ejaculate with
the,"understanding that,"
6602.94,with each subsequent ejaculation
over,"about a 24-hour period,"
6606.9,that there's going to
be,a dramatic reduction
6609.25,in the concentration of sperm.
6610.5,What that means is that
if,"a couple, for instance,"
6612.63,were to have intercourse
with,ejaculation many times
6615.75,on the day prior
to,"ovulation, yes,"
6617.55,that will introduce
a,lot of sperm
6619.83,into the reproductive pathway
of,"the female, but what it means"
6623.97,"is that, on the day of"
ovulation,if they were
6625.86,"to have intercourse, the"
number,of high quality sperm
6629.13,that will be available to the
egg,will be greatly diminished.
6632.73,And if none of the sperm
that,were introduced
6635.28,in the day prior managed
to,"fertilize that egg,"
6638.4,"well, then essentially"
chances,are off
6640.74,that there will be fertilization
or,they're greatly diminished.
6643.62,"Rather, if they're having"
intercourse,with ejaculation
6647.55,once or twice on the
day,prior to ovulation
6650.29,and then a maximal number
of,times with ejaculation
6653.91,on the day of
"ovulation,",that itself
6656.31,can maximize the probability
of,fertilization.
6658.72,So which strategy is optimal?
6660.09,Should couples have
as,much intercourse
6661.83,with ejaculation on the
day,prior to ovulation
6664.66,and on the day of ovulation?
6666.36,Or should they have intercourse
on,the day prior to ovulation
6670.53,but not so frequently that it
diminishes,the concentration
6673.86,of sperm and then
allows,for intercourse
6677.34,with the maximum
number,of ejaculations
6680.01,on the day of ovulation?
6681.57,You really hear it both ways.
6683.04,And what this really
boils,"down to is,"
6684.72,"frankly, that nobody knows."
6686.4,And the reason nobody
knows,is that there's
6688.35,tremendous variation
among,males in terms
6690.18,of the absolute concentration
of,sperm per milliliter
6693.93,of ejaculate and the amount
of,sperm per milliliter
6699.51,of ejaculate within
a,given time frame.
6701.92,But what everyone agrees on
is,that a period of abstinence
6705.84,ranging from 48 to 72 hours
prior,to an ejaculation
6709.86,increases the concentration
of,high-quality sperm
6712.83,within that first ejaculation
to,occur after the abstinence
6716.46,period.
6717.91,"So again, to reiterate, if one's"
goal,"is to fertilize the egg,"
6720.852,you want to take
into,consideration
6722.31,that most often
there,is going to be
6725.61,a dramatic decline in the
concentration,of sperm
6728.79,per ejaculate any time those
ejaculations,are occurring
6732.162,within a short
period,"of time, say,"
6733.62,within 12 to 24
hours,of one another.
6736.36,"Now, all of this,"
of,"course, also"
6738.39,relates to the female
biology,and the extent
6741.87,to which the woman can
precisely,identify the day
6745.29,and timing of her ovulation.
6746.85,Some women feel as if and
indeed,are very accurate
6750.93,at estimating their
time,of ovulation
6753.54,to within a couple of
hours,or some women even
6756.15,report being able to feel
their,"actual ovulation,"
6759.225,whether or not they are
feeling,the ovulation
6761.1,"itself, the deployment of"
the,"egg or not, isn't clear."
6763.947,I certainly wouldn't know.
6765.03,"I've never produced eggs,"
nor,"have I ovulated,"
6767.782,and I'm certainly not
going,to contest the idea
6769.74,that women can do that.
6772.405,"I mean, it makes"
sense,that some people
6774.03,have a very keen
so-called,interoceptive
6777.54,"awareness, an awareness"
of,the sensory events
6779.7,within their body.
6781.2,"And while, of course,"
the,ovaries are not
6783.72,thought of as an
organ,that we want
6785.43,to be able to sense what's going
on,"in there in terms of feel,"
6788.49,there are sensory
endings,within the ovary.
6790.59,And so the notion that one
could,literally sense changes
6794.497,"within their ovary, including"
the,"deployment of the egg,"
6796.83,is not outside the bounds
of,"reason and, in fact,"
6800.64,could likely be the case.
6801.9,"Now, that said, there are"
a,number of different ways
6805.027,that women will track
their,ovulation.
6806.61,One is the temperature method.
6808.15,So they'll actually measure
intravaginal,temperature.
6810.66,They're looking for
changes,in temperature
6812.41,that are consistent around
the,time of ovulation.
6815.11,We're going to have an expert
guest,"on, an OB/GYN, who"
6818.02,can tell us a lot more about
the,details and nuances
6820.927,of the temperature method.
6822.01,You'll see a lot of
information,"about this online,"
6823.88,but there's a lot of
misunderstanding,"about it,"
6825.838,as well.
6826.57,Other women will use apps
that,take into account
6829.3,either the temperature
information,
6830.89,if they're acquiring
temperature,information--
6833.565,that'll be entered
into,the app--
6834.94,as well as marking the
onset,"of menstruation,"
6838.9,the onset of
"bleeding,","therefore,"
6840.37,the start of the
ovulatory,"cycle,"
6841.87,"because, of course, as"
we,"mentioned earlier,"
6843.13,that marks day one
of,their cycle.
6844.9,"And then, again"
and,"again, you can"
6846.55,see how regularity
of,cycle duration
6848.95,or relative regularity
of,cycle duration
6851.68,really favors this whole
process,of being able to predict
6854.08,when one ovulates.
6856.15,"And fortunately, if the"
goal,"is fertilization,"
6860.32,there are some margins for error
that,are introduced by the fact
6864.19,that the sperm can survive
within,the female reproductive
6867.43,tract for some period of
"days,",thereby reducing
6871.3,the need for absolute certainty
about,the time of ovulation
6875.17,and so on.
6876.05,"In fact, it's pretty well"
known,that around the time
6878.77,of ovulation a couple
of,things happen.
6880.712,"Earlier, we talked"
about,"one thing,"
6882.17,which is there's an increase in
libido,just prior to ovulation.
6884.92,"This relates to, in"
"part,",an increase
6887.83,"in some of the androgens,"
things,"like DHEA,"
6891.25,but also testosterone and
some,related androgens
6894.73,that can increase libido both
in,males and females and changes
6900.94,"to the reproductive pathway,"
the,"female in particular,"
6904.21,a change in the pH-- that
"is,",the relative acidity
6907.48,versus basic nature of the
mucosal,lining near the cervix
6912.25,and also vaginal
"secretions,","such that,"
6914.74,"around the time of ovulation,"
the,entire milieu of the vagina
6919.75,and the cervix and the locations
in,which fertilization can
6923.32,occur and certainly in
which,the sperm are swimming
6925.78,towards the opportunity
for,fertilization
6927.79,is shifted to support
sperm,motility and health.
6931.16,"In other words, one of the"
best,environments for sperm
6933.43,to survive is going to be within
the,female reproductive pathway
6937.51,itself.
6938.2,And as long as we're talking
about,vaginal secretions
6940.69,"and mucus, it's"
important,to point out
6943.09,that a number of commercially
available,lubricants
6945.97,can actually be detrimental
for,"sperm health,"
6948.56,even if they don't
contain,spermicide.
6950.908,So this is something
that,you'll want
6952.45,to discuss with your OB/GYN
"or,","certainly if you're male,"
6956.89,you could also discuss
this,with your urologist
6958.96,and your partner's OB/GYN.
6961.72,A lot of the commercially
available,lubricants
6964.15,"contain chemicals that,"
while,they may favorably
6967.42,change the consistency
or,the viscosity
6970.24,of the vaginal pathway for
purposes,"of intercourse,"
6973.84,certainly may not be the most
favorable,for maintaining
6977.83,the health of the sperm and
the,motility of the sperm.
6980.08,"So again, here we're talking"
about,intercourse only
6983.62,in the context of trying
to,maximize fertilization.
6986.29,And I should mention
that,there are
6988.42,certain lubricants that are
more,conducive to the sperm
6990.82,environment.
6991.54,But it's something
that,you'll really
6993.082,want to talk to
your,OB/GYN about
6994.81,or at least read up
about,if your interest is
6997.54,in trying to fertilize
and,develop an embryo.
7000.1,So we covered the
optimal,strategies
7001.8,for how often couples
should,have intercourse
7004.8,with ejaculation around
the,time of ovulation
7008.1,in order to maximize
the,probability
7010.41,that successful fertilization
and,ultimately pregnancy will
7013.44,occur.
7014.46,What we haven't
covered,"yet, however,"
7016.44,is how long couples should apply
that,method over time in order
7021.81,to achieve successful
fertilization,in pregnancy.
7024.33,"Now, of course, if"
a,couple decides
7026.07,that they want to
conceive,and they
7027.63,apply that method or any
other,"method, for instance,"
7030.93,and they achieve fertilization
and,a successful pregnancy
7034.87,the very first
month,"that they try,"
7036.63,"well, then there's"
no,"other work to do,"
7038.52,at least until that
child,is born and if
7040.747,and only if they decide they
want,to have more children.
7043.08,"However, many couples"
find,that they do not
7046.74,conceive in the first
month,"of trying,"
7048.96,even when they apply
the,optimal methods
7050.97,and even if their age and every
other,factor related to egg
7054.3,quality and sperm
quality,is optimized.
7056.67,"Now, I think it's"
the,rare instance
7058.68,in which egg quality and
sperm,quality are optimized.
7061.98,"In fact, the word ""optimal"" and"
optimization,"and ""optimized"""
7064.878,is a little bit
misleading,in general
7066.42,because no one really
knows,what that is.
7068.25,"But of course,"
there,is an ideal.
7069.93,There's a perfect
standard,to which
7072.09,everyone would like to achieve.
7073.56,"But of course, we all enter the"
picture,"with genetic variables,"
7076.98,"environmental variables,"
and,"so forth, many of which"
7080.07,we'll talk about because you
"can,","in fact, adjust them"
7082.328,in the direction that you would
like,to improve sperm and egg
7084.87,quality.
7085.68,But most people simply
will,not succeed
7089.64,in achieving a successful
fertilization,the first month
7093.48,that they try.
7094.38,"Now, there is a"
truth,that governs
7096.99,how many tries it
ought,to take in order
7100.17,to achieve successful
fertilization,and ultimately
7103.11,pregnancy.
7103.74,And it's very age dependent.
7105.33,"And in particular, it's"
dependent,on the age
7107.55,"of the mother, because the"
age,"and quality of the egg,"
7110.49,while it's not the only
"factor,",is certainly
7113.99,one of the most determining
factors,in whether or not
7116.45,successful fertilization occurs.
7118.28,"And as women age, the"
quality,of the eggs
7120.8,tends to diminish
over,"time, largely"
7122.9,due to changes in the
mitochondrial,function
7124.97,and the spindle that pulls
the,"chromosomes apart,"
7127.52,although there could be other
factors,involved as well.
7130.26,"Now, before continuing"
any,"further,"
7131.88,I just want to acknowledge that
this,whole language around egg
7134.69,quality and sperm quality
is,not the greatest
7137.6,language because it's
entirely,subjective.
7140.3,"And yet the word ""quality"""
in,these instances
7143.51,is really there to
explain,a broad variety
7146.32,"of factors that can,"
in,"fact, be measured,"
7148.07,things like the number of
follicles,that are deployed
7150.65,each month in a woman's
ovulation,or the number
7153.8,of motile sperm or the number
of,morphologically-- that
7157.04,"is, correctly shaped sperm"
in,the male and so forth.
7159.355,So when we talk about egg
quality,"or sperm quality,"
7161.48,we're really referring to an
amalgam,of different features
7165.56,related to the different
aspects,of ovulation
7169.01,leading to successful
fertilization,
7170.72,or the different aspects of
sperm,related to whether or not
7174.02,they can arrive and
deliver,their DNA contents
7176.06,and so forth.
7176.76,"So I will use the words ""egg"
"quality""","and ""sperm quality"""
7179.27,just as general themes
because,that's what
7181.04,a lot of the clinicians use.
7182.72,But I do understand that it's
a,little bit of a loaded term
7185.18,"in both instances, and it"
doesn't,relate to any one
7188.09,"specific parameter, per se."
7190.52,So getting back to this
issue,of how long couples
7192.77,should try according to
the,age of the female
7195.41,and perhaps also
the,age of the male.
7197.36,"Well, most of the data"
that,have been collected
7199.85,relate to the age of the
"female,",as I mentioned before.
7202.44,And what we're
about,"to discuss is,"
7204.655,within the scientific
"literature,",
7206.03,described as what's
called,"fecundability,"
7208.52,which is the amount of time
over,which a given couple needs
7212.81,to attempt to
conceive--,"of course,"
7214.71,by having intercourse
with,ejaculation--
7216.83,around the time of ovulation.
7218.78,It assumes that all
the,other things
7220.28,are being done correctly.
7222.35,And what we know is that there's
a,strong age-dependent effect
7225.65,that largely rests on the
age,"of the egg-- that is,"
7228.86,of the female.
7229.82,And what we know is that
for,females 30 years old
7234.56,"or younger, if they have"
intercourse,with ejaculation
7238.565,around the time of
"ovulation,","say, on the day"
7240.44,before and on the
day,of ovulation--
7243.14,and there could be other
intercourse,with ejaculation
7245.72,around that time as well--
7247.73,"on average, that will result"
in,a successful fertilization
7251.78,in pregnancy about
20%,of the time
7254.84,on the first month
of,"attempting,"
7256.73,the first ovulation cycle.
7258.71,"Now, if fertilization and"
pregnancy,"occurs, great."
7261.788,There'll be at least
a,nine-month lag
7263.33,until they decide
whether,or not they
7264.95,want to try and conceive again.
7266.51,"However, most couples, even"
if,the woman is 30 years
7270.35,"old or younger, will"
not,successfully
7272.51,conceive on that first attempt.
7275.0,And that's because the
probability,is not 100%.
7277.55,It's 20%.
7278.42,"So 80% of the time,"
they,simply will not
7280.82,"conceive, which means that"
they,hopefully will try again
7284.81,the very next month.
7286.02,And if they successfully
"conceive,",great.
7288.253,"And if they don't,"
then,they ought
7289.67,"to try again the next month,"
the,"next month, and so forth."
7292.11,"Now, the typical advice that"
an,OB/GYN would give you
7295.52,"is that, for a woman"
30,years or younger--
7299.12,and leaving aside
the,age of the father
7302.81,but still assuming that egg
quality,and sperm quality
7306.95,are sufficiently high to
achieve,fertilization--
7309.68,that the couple should--
7312.485,or if the woman is trying
to,"have kids alone,"
7314.36,the woman should
attempt,to conceive over
7316.82,the period of six months.
7318.59,Why?
7319.22,"Well, if you think"
about,"it, if there's"
7320.845,a 20% chance in the first month
and,"it's unsuccessful, well,"
7324.44,"then on the second month,"
there'll,also be a 20% chance.
7327.08,"On the third month,"
also,a 20% chance.
7329.0,What I'm describing
here,is what obviously
7332.0,is independent probabilities.
7334.43,"That is, if you"
were,to flip a coin
7336.29,and the probability of
getting,"heads is 50%,"
7338.46,the probability of getting
tails,"is 50%, of course."
7341.48,You don't expect that the
previous,flip had anything
7344.245,to do with the
result,that you'll
7345.62,get on the subsequent flip.
7346.67,That's what independent
probabilities,are.
7348.42,"However, when it comes"
to,"fecundability,"
7351.86,we're really talking
about,something
7353.36,which is called cumulative
pregnancy,"rate, which"
7356.12,is not really independent
probabilities.,
7358.25,"Now, why would that be?"
7359.31,Why would it be that if
you,did not successfully
7361.31,conceive in the first
month,"of trying that,"
7363.8,by simply trying again and
again,"and again, the probability"
7366.53,of conceiving would increase?
7368.13,"Well, the reason for that"
is,that this whole business
7370.43,of fertilization is
not,just about what's
7372.172,happening with the egg.
7373.13,It's also about what's
happening,with the sperm.
7375.2,So there are a number of
different,events related
7377.84,to the biology of the egg and
the,"biology of the sperm, which"
7380.423,you are now very familiar
with,from everything
7382.34,I've talked about up until now.
7383.81,And there a bunch
of,"chance events,"
7386.248,"for instance, that the"
sperm,won't actually
7388.04,arrive at the egg in time
or,that the egg won't arrive
7391.012,"at the sperm in time,"
"because,","of course,"
7392.72,it's a bidirectional
migration,of those two cell
7394.72,"types, or that, for"
whatever,"reason,"
7396.74,fertilization won't occur.
7397.935,So what we're really
talking,about when
7399.56,we talk about the cumulative
pregnancy,rate over time
7402.83,is the fact that there are
multiple,probabilities at work.
7405.86,"And yes, those are somewhat"
independent,in the sense
7408.62,that the biology of the
sperm,doesn't really strictly
7411.08,depend on the
biology,"of the egg,"
7412.52,at least not until they
meet,and fertilize.
7414.41,But the likelihood
of,pregnancy depends
7418.28,on those independent
"probabilities,",
7419.94,which makes this a
cumulative,pregnancy rate.
7422.635,"Now, if any of that is"
"confusing,",what it basically
7424.76,means is that for
the,egg and the sperm
7426.71,"to meet and to fertilize, a"
number,of different events
7429.14,that carry some intentionality--
7432.015,the sperm swims towards
the,egg and so forth.
7433.89,The egg doesn't have a
personality,"in there,"
7436.82,at least not yet.
7437.69,"But it, quote, unquote,"
wants,to be fertilize.
7440.27,"It is, in principle,"
receptive,to fertilization.
7443.42,"Well, in order for"
that,"to happen,"
7445.975,there are going to be some
events,related to chance
7448.1,that could limit the
ability,"for that to happen,"
7450.188,and there'll be
other,events dictated
7451.73,by the biology of those
two,cell types that
7453.59,are driving that
event,"to happen,"
7455.81,that are biasing the
event,"to, yes, happen."
7457.7,And so what we're
talking,about when
7459.2,we talk about cumulative
pregnancy,rate
7461.0,is how much of the
biology,of the woman
7464.18,is skewed towards fertilization
to,be likely to occur.
7468.03,So to make this very
"simple,",all we need to know
7470.87,is that for women 30
years,"old or younger,"
7473.15,because the probability of
getting,pregnant on any one
7477.77,attempt to conceive
is,"20%, well,"
7482.21,then if that doesn't
occur,"the first time,"
7484.55,then she should simply
repeat,that at least five
7486.92,and probably six times before
deciding,to go to an OB/GYN
7490.58,and conclude that there's
something,going on either
7492.86,"with the egg or, of course,"
it,could be with the sperm
7495.29,because 20 times 5 is 100.
7496.873,So we're talking about
cumulative,percent--
7498.665,"so 20, 40, 60, 80, 100."
7501.47,And the six month
there,would take you
7503.75,"to 120%, which is a"
different,thing altogether.
7507.63,"But in general,"
that's,why OB/GYNs
7509.547,will tell their
female,"patients, look,"
7511.13,if you're setting
out,"to conceive,"
7512.63,try for about five
or,"six months,"
7514.56,"and if you're not successful,"
come,back and see me.
7517.1,"Now, for women who"
are,"age 31 to 33,"
7521.33,the probability of conceiving
in,that first month
7523.49,drops to about 18%.
7525.27,So women in that age
range,and their partners
7527.51,should certainly try
and,conceive naturally
7529.79,over a period of six or
seven,months in order
7532.49,to get to that 100%
cumulative,probability.
7534.74,And then for women
who,"are age 34 to 37,"
7537.92,the probability of conceiving
in,that first month
7540.5,of trying and certainly every
month,thereafter is about 11%.
7545.238,So when the age of the
woman,starts extending out
7547.28,to about 34 or 35 years
"old,",then the typical advice
7550.76,of the OB/GYN is going to be
to,attempt to conceive over
7554.06,a period of about
nine,months to a year
7556.55,before deciding to take some
sort,of medical intervention.
7560.75,"And then, of course, as the"
age,"of the woman increases,"
7563.66,so too does the quality
of,the eggs go down.
7566.51,"Now, that's not true"
for,every woman.
7568.07,"There are many women who, in"
their,late 30s and 40s and even
7570.86,"early 50s, have successfully"
conceived,"healthy children,"
7574.37,although the probability of
that--,the likelihood of it
7577.25,drops substantially.
7578.73,"So for instance, for women"
who,"are age 38 to 39,"
7581.93,the probability of a
successful,conception
7584.42,by natural conception--
intercourse,with ejaculation--
7587.66,is going to be about 5%.
7590.06,So it's really dropped
to,a quarter of what
7592.52,it was when that woman was 30.
7595.31,"Again, these are averages only."
7596.99,What does that mean?
7597.87,"Well, it means that if"
you,"are age 38 or older,"
7601.01,chances are that you should
probably,go to your OB/GYN
7604.67,right at the outset
of,your desire
7606.29,to conceive and ask what you
can,do to improve egg quality.
7609.11,"Otherwise, if you were"
to,"extend the math out,"
7611.68,we know that if you're age
30,"or younger, 20% chance"
7614.67,in any one given month.
7615.91,That means about four
to,six months of trying.
7617.97,"Well, you can simply multiply"
that,times four or five
7622.02,for someone in their
late,30s or early 40s.
7624.685,And so what you're
really,talking about
7626.31,is several years of trying.
7627.57,"And of course, what's happening"
during,those several years?
7629.61,The woman is getting older.
7630.99,"And as a consequence,"
the,quality of the eggs
7632.94,is declining even further.
7634.9,"So if you are 35, 36"
years,"old, it might not"
7639.45,be entirely unreasonable to
talk,to your OB/GYN right
7642.03,at the outset of
desiring,"to conceive,"
7644.132,but you could also
just,take the approach
7645.84,of trying to conceive naturally
for,about a year or a year
7648.3,and a half before deciding
to,"do that, keeping in mind"
7651.33,that all the while
you,can't stop time.
7653.31,So biological time and aging is
going,to occur in the backdrop.
7656.79,But hopefully this description
of,cumulative pregnancy rate
7660.45,makes sense.
7661.2,"Again, the idea is"
that,while it's true
7663.87,that every single month
there's,an independent chance
7667.08,of the woman getting pregnant
and,that chance is dropping
7671.37,from abut 20% at age 30 over
time,"to about, really, 1% to 3%"
7676.08,for women 40 or
"older,",there's also
7678.33,this notion of cumulative
"probability,",which
7680.73,involves multiple
biological,events in both
7683.13,the egg and the sperm that have
to,converge in time and space
7686.4,in order for successful
fertilization,to occur.
7688.92,As long as we're
on,"this topic, I"
7690.35,think it's only fair to address
the,issue of miscarriage.
7693.6,And miscarriages can arise
from,a variety of sources.
7696.36,They can arise from
genetic,defects.
7698.46,They can arise from issues in
the,milieu view of the uterus.
7701.64,They can arise from issues with
the,"sperm, for that matter."
7704.67,We really don't want to
put,all the weight and all
7707.16,the responsibility on the egg.
7709.36,This is always an
egg/sperm,dynamic.
7711.33,And when I say
egg/sperm,"dynamic, now"
7713.19,hopefully that calls to mind
the,huge library of information
7715.89,that we've been
covering,up until now
7717.432,about chromosomal segregation
and,the coming together
7719.97,of these different cell types
and,their genetic information.
7722.67,Any number of different
steps,within the process
7725.22,of fertilization
leading,up to pregnancy
7727.32,can lead to miscarriage.
7729.33,"However, the probability"
of,miscarriage
7732.66,greatly increases as a
function,of the age of the egg.
7737.4,And the basic numbers
on,thisare are
7740.25,that for women who are 35
years,"or older, about 25%"
7745.92,of successful fertilizations
lead,to miscarriages.
7749.22,"Now, when those miscarriages"
occur,during pregnancy
7752.04,can be highly variable.
7753.3,Sometimes it's within
the,first trimester.
7755.19,Sometimes it could be later.
7757.36,But the probability
is,about 25%.
7760.32,That probability increases
greatly,"over time,"
7764.2,such that by the time women
are,in their early 40s--
7767.22,so 40 or older--
7768.43,the probability of
miscarriage,after
7770.19,a successful fertilization
is,going to be about 50%.
7773.52,And this could be due
to,"a number of factors,"
7775.8,as I mentioned before.
7776.79,But one common reason
is,that there can
7779.7,be chromosomal abnormalities.
7781.32,And that could be
related,typically
7783.45,to the segregation
of,the egg when
7786.72,half of the
chromosomes,in that egg
7788.22,"are removed, taking it"
from,diploid to haploid.
7790.62,"If you recall, there's"
that,"little polar body,"
7793.21,which is the removal of
the,chromosomes that's
7796.29,ejected from the egg that
will,eventually ovulate.
7798.48,And sometimes not
all,the chromosomes
7800.46,that were supposed to be ejected
in,that polar body are ejected.
7804.54,"And as a consequence, there"
are,multiple chromosomes
7806.79,"or duplications of chromosomes,"
things,like trisomies.
7809.37,Sometimes too many
chromosomes,move away
7811.422,and there are actually
removal,"of entire chromosomes,"
7813.63,"meaning both strands, so that"
you,have chromosomal deletions.
7816.6,"And in that case, typically"
fertilization,won't occur.
7819.473,But there are instances in
which,fertilization will occur.
7821.89,So a woman will get a
positive,pregnancy test.
7823.89,Her periods will stop.
7825.39,And the couple will
think,that they're
7827.43,advancing along the steps
to,"a successful pregnancy,"
7831.19,"and then there will be,"
"sadly,",a miscarriage.
7833.67,"Many, many times"
those,miscarriages
7835.95,are the consequence
of,"the fact that,"
7837.99,when there are extra
chromosomes,there or there
7840.93,"are too few chromosomes present,"
that,embryogenesis can simply
7846.12,not progress in a healthy way.
7848.43,There are some
instances,in which
7850.62,all of the chromosomes and all
the,chromosomal arrangements
7853.14,are perfectly normal and
miscarriages,can still occur.
7857.08,I'm going to do a future
episode,about pregnancy
7860.1,and embryonic
development,where we
7861.69,will get into this more deeply.
7863.14,But just understand that the
frequency,of miscarriages
7866.37,increases dramatically
after,about age 34
7870.06,and then continues to
increase,"dramatically,"
7872.82,extending well
out,until the 40s.
7875.01,"Now, a very important"
consideration,
7876.96,in terms of understanding
and,predicting
7878.94,"fertility and fecundability,"
this,word that describes
7882.33,the probability of getting
pregnant,on a given try
7884.85,"and over time, is"
trying,"to address how,"
7889.41,"quote, unquote,"
fertile,a woman is
7891.99,"and, importantly, how, quote,"
"unquote,","""fertile"" a male is."
7896.04,And we'll talk about the
male,side in a moment.
7898.48,But when trying to address how
fertile,"a woman is, of course,"
7902.07,age is going to be one of the
major,"factors, but just one"
7905.97,factor.
7906.94,We already talked about
how,age determines
7908.7,the likelihood of a
successful,pregnancy
7911.23,if the intercourse and
ejaculation,is being carried
7915.33,out at the correct times
and,with viable sperm
7918.63,capable of fertilizing eggs.
7920.7,"And then, of course, there's"
the,issue of egg quality.
7923.1,"But in general, most"
women,would like
7925.38,to know how fertile they are
as,a function of their age.
7930.09,And I actually think this is
one,of the most important topics
7933.03,in this whole space
around,fertility
7934.8,that isn't often discussed or
at,least isn't often discussed
7937.56,until women are in
their,"late 30s or 40s,"
7940.74,when oftentimes
they,will look back
7943.012,and wish that either they
had,frozen their eggs
7944.97,or they had frozen fertilized
"embryos,",which is a whole thing
7948.6,unto itself.
7949.223,And we can talk
about,that when we
7950.64,have an episode on in-vitro
fertilization,in more depth.
7954.0,But there is a fairly
straightforward,way
7957.24,or set of ways that
women,can determine
7959.88,their basic level of fertility.
7962.67,Leaving aside a lot
of,the detailed issues
7964.8,about the quality of eggs
and,"so forth, one thing"
7967.56,that you already learned
is,"that there's this vault,"
7969.78,there's this reserve that
we,"call the ovarian reserve,"
7972.42,and that each month a
certain,number of follicles
7975.57,"leave that reserve, and"
there's,"the opportunity, based"
7979.8,on the ovulation of a single
"egg,",to fertilize that egg
7983.7,and for the woman
to,get pregnant.
7985.29,"Now, one thing that"
we,know for sure
7986.91,is that the size of
the,population that's
7990.45,released from that
vault,each month
7993.33,has a very strong
positive,correlation
7996.36,with the size of the
reserve,in the vault itself.
7999.85,So the way to think
about,"this, perhaps,"
8002.48,is that the vault is
like,a bank account.
8004.58,It has a certain
amount,of money--
8006.9,"in this case, eggs-- in it."
8008.3,"And you could imagine, if"
someone's,"reasonably logical,"
8012.05,that if they have more money
in,"their bank account, then"
8014.42,they're going to
withdraw,a larger amount
8016.718,each month than if they have
a,"small amount each month,"
8019.01,if the idea is to make
that,"vault, that bank,"
8022.37,of eggs available to them over
the,longest period of time.
8026.87,"And indeed, biology"
is,pretty smart.
8028.86,It doesn't deploy or release
half,the follicles in one month
8033.35,and then just slowly trickle
out,the remainder of follicles.
8035.903,"No, that's not how it works."
8037.07,"What you find is that, of"
"course,",in younger women--
8039.86,"so, say, in their late"
"teens,","20s, and 30s--"
8043.91,the ovarian reserve
in,the vault is
8045.89,going to have more eggs
in,"it, and the number"
8048.56,of follicles and eggs that
leave,that vault each month
8051.26,is going to be quite high.
8052.65,So one way to evaluate
"how,","quote, unquote,"
8056.21,"""fertile"" you are--"
8057.71,"again, just one way--"
is,to go to your OB/GYN
8060.89,and say that you would like
to,know how many follicles
8063.32,you have in a given month.
8064.507,"And of course, they'll"
look,"at them on both sides,"
8066.59,in both ovaries.
8068.03,"And for instance, if a woman"
has,just two or three follicles
8072.95,"that are out each month, well,"
then,"the assumption-- again,"
8076.323,it's just an assumption-- but
the,assumption that's pretty
8078.74,good-- because there is this
positive,correlation that
8081.5,generally occurs--
8082.4,is that that ovarian reserve--
8084.95,that the number of
eggs,in the vault
8086.81,is fairly low
compared,to someone
8089.09,"who, say, has 20 follicles"
or,30 follicles each month.
8093.2,And that's the typical trend.
8094.49,"Again, these are averages."
8095.7,And it's very important to not
get,attached to any one number
8098.33,here.
8098.83,"Again, these are averages."
8100.17,"So for instance, there are women"
who,only deploy five follicles
8105.23,and eggs each month out
of,their ovarian vault
8107.81,but who find themselves
to,be very fertile.
8109.8,And there could be a
number,of different factors
8111.8,to explain that.
8112.49,Other women will
have,20 or 30 eggs
8115.13,and follicles that leave that
"vault,","the ovarian reserve,"
8117.71,each month.
8118.263,And they will have a
harder,time getting
8119.93,pregnant for any number
of,different reasons.
8121.805,"But in general, the"
more,eggs and follicles
8123.98,that leave the vault each
"month,",the higher number
8127.28,of eggs that are still in
"reserve,",meaning the greater
8129.95,amount of time over which
a,given woman could still
8132.65,attempt to have
successful,fertilizations.
8135.9,"Now, this small collection"
of,follicles and eggs
8139.138,that are released each
month,actually has a name.
8141.18,They're called antral follicles.
8142.4,These are small follicles.
8143.483,They tend to be about 2
to,9 millimeters across.
8145.73,The way these are
analyzed,or measured
8147.74,is woman will go into the OB/GYN
"office,",and by ultrasound--
8152.03,typically there's
some,"local anesthesia,"
8153.71,but it's not often a
general,"anesthesia,"
8155.9,but by local anesthesia or
sometimes,no anesthesia--
8158.99,they will essentially count
the,number of follicles that
8162.11,"are present in each side,"
on,ovary on the left
8165.05,"and the ovary on the right, and"
give,a woman some sense of how
8168.77,many follicles she has.
8169.94,And typically this is done
over,a series of months
8172.28,to determine how many eggs
are,leaving the ovarian
8175.49,reserve each month and
therefore,how many eggs
8177.89,she is likely to still have
in,the ovarian reserve.
8181.49,now there's a noninvasive
way,"to do this, as well."
8184.13,"Although, typically, an OB/GYN"
will,do both what I just
8187.37,described with ultrasound and
measure,"something called AMH,"
8190.67,"which is anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone,"
which,is a hormone that is
8194.209,released by that antral
follicle,"population,"
8197.12,the population of follicles
and,eggs that leave the ovarian
8200.48,reserve each month.
8201.35,So one is a blood draw
measure,"of a hormone, AMH."
8204.5,The other is a structural
imaging,measure
8206.75,of the antral
follicles,directly.
8209.389,again the typical trend is for
the,number of antral follicles
8213.03,to decline over time.
8214.6,"So one might expect,"
for,"instance,"
8216.48,that a woman in her 20s or
30s,"might have 20, 30, maybe"
8220.29,even 40 antral
follicles,that are
8222.478,exiting the reserve each month.
8223.77,"And again, that's the"
total,across both ovaries.
8227.1,"Again, these are just averages."
8228.52,These are going to
be,distributions.
8229.62,There will be people
with,far fewer.
8230.85,There will be people
with,far more.
8232.308,"But that over time, regardless"
of,"where a woman starts out,"
8238.139,from one decade to the
next,half decade and decade
8241.24,"and so on, that the number of"
antral,follicles will decline
8244.469,and the amount of or the levels
of,AMH will also decline.
8248.77,So what does this all mean?
8250.629,What this means
is,that if you are
8252.36,a woman who is in her 20s or
30s,"or 40s, whatever your age,"
8257.73,if you are interested in
conceiving,"in the future,"
8260.29,it's very likely a good
idea,to go to your OB/GYN
8264.6,and get either your AMH levels
measured,or your follicle count
8268.86,measured and to do that several
times,in a given period.
8272.01,And I don't mean a
menstrual,period.
8273.51,I mean given a period of
time,across several months
8275.78,to determine what is the average
number,"of follicles, what's"
8278.28,"your average AMH level,"
thereby,giving you
8282.24,some window into how many
eggs,you are likely to still
8285.99,have in your ovarian reserve.
8287.37,I cannot tell you how many women
that,I've spoken to and how
8290.1,many OB/GYNs--
8290.7,"more importantly,"
because,they speak
8292.2,to many more women about this
than,I ever have or ever will--
8296.01,wish that they had
done,this earlier.
8298.75,"They think, oh,"
"well,","I'm in my 20s,"
8300.33,so I'm likely to have
a,"ton of follicles,"
8302.038,or they got pregnant
once,"before,"
8303.413,and so they're not so concerned
about,the number of follicles
8305.955,or their AMH levels.
8307.02,But over and over
"again,",I was told
8309.45,in researching for this
episode,that the earlier
8312.27,and more frequent that women
do,this procedure of measuring
8315.51,AMH and measuring
their,"follicle count,"
8318.45,the higher the probability
that,they will eventually
8320.73,have a successful
fertilization,and pregnancy
8322.83,when they seek to do so.
8324.36,"Now, the mirror image of all"
"this,","of course, is the sperm."
8327.78,And there's a kind of
common,misconception
8330.299,"out there that, you know,"
the,"sperm, you only need one."
8333.7,And indeed you only need one.
8334.92,"But actually, you"
need,"many, and it's"
8337.41,only one that's able to
successfully,fertilize the egg.
8341.25,So this whole
concept,of you only
8342.84,need one is both
dismissive,of the sperm
8345.66,but more importantly
dismissive,of the biology
8347.61,of the sperm and the egg.
8349.86,It only takes one successful
sperm,"and one successful egg,"
8353.653,but that's sort of
like,"telling a woman,"
8355.32,"hey, you only need one egg."
8357.299,You need one egg of sufficient
quality,in the right time
8361.26,"and place, and"
you,need one sperm
8363.69,of sufficient quality in
the,right time and place
8366.24,in order to get successful
fertilization,and hopefully
8368.58,pregnancy.
8369.93,But you need a lot
of,sperm in order
8374.219,to get a high probability
that,that one sperm will
8378.209,be able to successfully
fertilize,the egg.
8380.379,So we have this image of
sperm,as these dumb operators
8383.25,that just sort of swim
mindlessly,towards anything.
8386.603,"And if they bump into an egg,"
then,they fertilize the egg.
8389.02,And that's really
not,the way it works.
8390.78,As I talked about
"earlier,",the sperm--
8392.58,"with its head, its"
mid,"region, its tail,"
8394.47,chock a block with mitochondria
in,the mid region--
8397.2,is really an active motile
cell,that indeed will just
8401.19,"swim forward, if it's a healthy,"
forward,progressing sperm.
8404.34,But many males out
there,just simply
8407.19,do not have any knowledge
of,how many quality
8410.04,sperm that they happen to have.
8411.63,"Now, given the fact"
that,sperm analysis
8413.49,is relatively inexpensive and
also,the fact that freezing
8417.27,sperm is relatively
"inexpensive,",I
8419.6,think it stands to reason that
most,men should at least get
8422.43,some window into the number
and,quality of their sperm.
8425.747,"Now, it's a fair assumption"
to,say that if someone
8427.83,is in their late teens
or,early 20s or 30s
8431.67,that they probably have
high-quality,sperm.
8433.62,"But again, as with the"
egg,and the importance
8436.44,of measuring AMH and
follicle,"count across time,"
8439.8,men should really evaluate
the,quality and number
8442.205,of their sperm.
8442.83,And we talked a
little,bit earlier
8444.247,about some of the parameters
that,urologists and OB/GYNs
8447.84,like to see when
evaluating,sperm.
8450.84,There's a minimum number
or,concentration of sperm
8453.96,that they'd like to see if
a,couple is going to use
8456.33,"IVF, in-vitro fertilization."
8458.07,And typically that's going
to,be about 15 to 20 million
8460.5,per mil of sperm or semen.
8463.68,And typically they want to
see,somewhere between 2 and 5
8466.86,"milliliters of semen,"
"overall,",in a given
8469.86,ejaculate after a 72 to 48 hour
abstinence,"period, because,"
8474.12,"of course, the"
more,"ejaculations,"
8475.92,the smaller the volume
of,the ejaculate
8479.52,in a short period of time.
8481.09,But after 48 to 72
"hours,",you more or less
8484.08,maximize the volume
of,ejaculate.
8486.3,"And then, of course, they"
want,to see 50% but typically
8489.27,60% or more of motile
sperm,"in order to get IVF,"
8492.73,but more is better.
8493.79,"And of course, there"
is,"an enormous range,"
8495.54,as I mentioned before.
8496.457,Some males will have anywhere
from,10 to 20 million sperm
8501.15,per milliliter of
"ejaculate,",and some men
8504.48,will have 100 to 200 million.
8507.495,But just because they
have,100 to 200 million
8509.37,doesn't mean that all of those
sperm,are of high quality
8511.832,and can fertilize eggs.
8512.79,Sometimes more than
half,"will be twitchers,"
8515.7,"and some will be immotile,"
and,so on and so forth.
8517.81,So it's very
straightforward,what
8519.883,I believe most people
should,do and what
8521.55,the urologists I spoke to
in,advance of this episode
8525.03,"said to do, which is to"
simply,do a sperm analysis.
8527.82,Refrain from ejaculation
for,48 to 72 hours.
8531.09,Give a sperm sample.
8532.89,Have that sperm sample analyzed.
8534.63,The cost of the sperm analysis
is,not typically that much.
8539.04,And considering that conception
and,healthy conception
8542.64,and fertilization is
an,expensive process
8544.8,if you have to go the
in-vitro,"fertilization route,"
8547.5,it stands to reason that the
cost,is pretty well justified.
8550.08,You also have the option
to,freeze sperm over time.
8552.66,There is evidence that
the,age of the father
8555.33,and therefore the
age,of the sperm
8557.55,can dictate whether
or,not there's
8559.23,a higher incidence of
problematic,pregnancy
8562.8,"or developmental outcomes,"
including,autism.
8565.38,That is true.
8566.708,You've probably heard
that,if the father is
8568.5,"40 years or older, the"
incidence,of autism
8571.53,is increased significantly.
8572.85,That is true.
8573.69,Although the overall probability
of,having an autistic offspring
8578.88,"if somebody-- if the father,"
that,is-- is 40 years or older
8581.76,is still quite a bit lower
than,you would imagine.
8584.88,It's not as if the probability
suddenly,skyrockets.
8588.49,So we'll have an
episode,on autism
8590.4,and genetic and
non-genetic,influences
8593.85,on autism and other aspects
of,the autism spectrum.
8596.91,But the point is this.
8599.7,I believe and the
urologists,I spoke
8602.04,to who are interested in
fertility,and male health
8604.8,and sexual health
suggest,that men
8606.93,get their sperm analyzed
at,least once every five
8611.01,"years and certainly,"
if,they're going
8613.35,to want to conceive children
in,"the distant future,"
8616.05,that they consider freezing
their,"sperm because that, too,"
8618.69,is fairly nominal cost in order
to,freeze sperm at a younger
8621.85,age.
8622.35,"And of course, if you"
can,freeze and use sperm
8624.54,from the time in which you
were,"younger, why wouldn't you,"
8627.22,right?
8627.72,"I mean, you can still opt"
to,go for natural pregnancy
8630.36,later if that's
what,you want to do.
8631.89,But having that in reserve
is,generally a good idea.
8635.31,And I discussed some of the
parameters,that are looked for.
8638.01,And perhaps most
"importantly,",there
8640.71,is the possibility of an
underlying,"issue whereby,"
8643.47,"for instance, there is very"
little,sperm in an ejaculate.
8649.02,"As I mentioned earlier, the"
seminal,fluid in the ejaculate
8651.78,"could have zero sperm in it,"
but,the volume of ejaculate
8654.54,could appear completely normal.
8656.08,So just because your ejaculate
volume,is normal to you
8659.4,or is in that range
of,"2 to 5 milliliters,"
8662.772,"well, then that"
doesn't,necessarily
8664.23,mean that there
are,any sperm there
8665.688,or that there are very few sperm
there,and the few sperm that
8670.08,are there or the many sperm that
there,are functionally motile.
8673.12,So get this analyzed.
8674.25,It's really worth doing.
8675.257,"And again, it's not something"
you,have to do every year.
8677.59,It's something that you want to
do,"probably every five years,"
8680.37,at least until the
point,where you've
8681.48,conceived as many children
as,you ever want to conceive.
8683.813,So the basic takeaway here
is,"that, if you're a woman,"
8686.37,to get your egg count--
your,"antral follicle count,"
8689.94,that is--
8690.78,and therefore your reserve
of,"eggs, indirectly measured,"
8694.95,and of course also get
your,"AMH levels measured,"
8697.59,and if you're a male to
have,a sperm analysis
8699.72,and to do that relatively early.
8701.1,"In fact, another"
incentive,for doing
8702.6,that early is that
you,have a comparison
8704.267,"point so that, for instance,"
if,you are in your early 20s
8706.78,and you're not thinking
about,having kids at all
8708.78,or you're thinking that
you,might someday have kids
8710.37,"but it's a really someday,"
"someday,","far off in the future,"
8713.28,"well, it's wonderful to have"
a,reference point from which
8716.28,to compare your biology
in,your early 20s
8719.46,to your biology in your
mid,or late 30s or 40s when
8722.49,you might happen to be
interested,in conceiving.
8725.34,And if that doesn't
provide,"incentive enough,"
8728.55,I should mention-- and this
is,important to point out
8730.95,and that I think both
males,and females are not
8734.1,aware of-- is that one in
five,couples that have issues
8738.03,"with fertility,"
the,issue ends up
8741.15,falling on the biology that
is,the quality of the sperm
8744.72,or a lack of number of sperm.
8746.83,So I think there's a
misconception,that when
8749.55,fertility is an issue it's
always,an issue with the eggs
8752.74,and this age-dependent decline
in,"the egg quality-- again,"
8756.507,it's the best language we have
available,to us at the moment--
8759.09,this age-dependent decline in
egg,"quality is often to blame,"
8762.63,but not always.
8763.56,One in five couples that
have,challenges conceiving it
8766.147,turns out that it's going to
be,an issue with the sperm.
8768.48,"And of course, there are a"
number,of different sperm
8769.92,"analyses that, should all"
the,other parameters of sperm
8772.86,"appear normal,"
"now,","for instance,"
8774.87,you can get a DNA
fragmentation,analysis.
8777.472,You can see whether or
not,the DNA of the sperm
8779.43,are somehow disrupted.
8780.99,Urologists these days are
excellent,"at figuring out,"
8784.53,"for instance, if a male"
has,"lots and lots of sperm,"
8787.23,"everything looks great, but the"
shape,of the head of the sperm
8790.2,isn't quite right-- if
it's,not oval enough
8792.24,"and it's too rounded, that could"
be,a genetic defect under which
8795.69,conditions there is zero
probability,of the male ever
8801.15,"naturally conceiving, regardless"
of,who the female partner is.
8804.78,"Believe it or not, males"
can,"have a ton of sperm,"
8807.12,but if they carry a
certain,"genetic defect,"
8809.4,those sperm will be incapable
of,depositing those 23
8812.94,chromosomes into the egg.
8815.08,"However, there are ways"
in,which that sperm can
8818.4,be coaxed or forced
to,fertilize the egg
8821.16,and deposit its genetic contents
by,in-vitro fertilization
8823.71,and then implantation
into,the female.
8825.37,"So again, lots of"
reasons,to have a egg
8828.54,reserve analysis by
ultrasound,and AMH
8830.85,for females and lots
of,reasons for males
8833.46,to have a sperm analysis.
8834.87,"And of course, typically"
with,a sperm analysis
8837.09,and a ovarian reserve analysis
will,be a hormone analysis.
8842.72,And I'm a very strong believer
in,people getting an insight--
8846.53,"that is, a window--"
8847.4,into their hormonal
"composition,",not just
8850.25,when they encounter
problems,but starting
8852.98,"at a pretty early age, even if"
it's,only done once every five
8855.59,"years or so, having a"
reference,point to your 20s
8858.77,and to your 30s and mid-30s for
when,you felt a certain way.
8861.65,"Maybe, as in the case"
for,"many people I know,"
8864.2,they actually feel
better,in their 40s
8865.88,than they did in their
20s,because they're
8867.17,doing a lot of things
to,support their health.
8868.76,That is possible.
8869.76,"But in many cases,"
people,start feeling
8871.76,not as well or their fertility
seems,to be dropping off
8875.103,or any number of different
parameters,that we've discussed
8877.52,today were related to
vitality,and longevity seem
8880.1,to be dropping off
over,"time, and they"
8881.96,want to get a insight into
what,could be the issue.
8884.745,And hormones are
"sometimes,","not always,"
8886.37,but sometimes involved in
those,underlying issues.
8889.2,And there is nothing as valuable
as,having a reference point
8893.21,from a time in which
things,were going well
8895.49,"to evaluate the, for"
"instance,","levels of hormones,"
8898.85,not just testosterone but
also,estrogen and progesterone
8901.92,and so forth.
8902.85,So you need a comparison
point,in order
8904.55,to determine what really
needs,to be changed.
8906.57,So all of this is a strong
push,for people to use
8910.058,"your insurance, if you're"
able,to put it on insurance--
8912.35,oftentimes people are--
8914.39,"and if not, to try and find a"
reasonable,or reasonably priced
8918.92,way to do a sperm
and,egg analysis
8922.34,and to ideally do a
hormone,analysis as well.
8925.38,It's really going to set you
up,for the maximum probability
8927.86,of being able to conceive
children,when you want to
8929.985,and also to avoid a bunch of
other,health-related issues
8932.96,that involve hormones
and,reproductive health
8936.35,"and, in general, to support"
your,mental health and physical
8939.29,health.
8939.805,So I've been talking about
a,bunch of things to do.
8941.93,There are a couple of things to
be,mindful of to actively avoid
8945.47,if your goal is to be
and,remain fertile.
8948.41,And that's regardless
of,whether or not
8950.3,you want to conceive children
in,the future or not.
8953.24,"Now, in the context"
of,"this discussion,"
8955.04,the same things that
we've,heard to be
8956.75,true for other
aspects,of our health
8958.43,turn out to also be true.
8960.06,So let's just start
with,the basics.
8962.66,Everybody should be getting
approximately,six to eight
8966.43,hours of sleep every night.
8967.64,That should be quality sleep.
8969.11,Optimizing your sleep is
fundamental,to balancing
8971.977,your hormones.
8972.56,"Now, balancing your"
hormones,is kind
8974.06,of a catch phrase for all
things,related to proper hormone
8976.52,regulation.
8978.05,Sleep is the fundamental
layer,"of mental health,"
8980.19,"physical health, and"
performance,of all kinds
8982.61,"and, believe it"
or,"not, fertility."
8984.68,When people are not
sleeping,"well or enough,"
8987.35,"stress hormones, in"
particular,"cortisol,"
8989.51,shift to peaking
later,"in the day,"
8991.67,and those elevated cortisol
levels,later in the day
8994.13,cause a bunch of
different,problems
8996.41,"in both males and females,"
many,of which impact fertility.
8999.11,So controlling cortisol starts
with,controlling your sleep.
9003.08,It also impacts testosterone
and,estrogen levels.
9006.89,"So of course, the proper ratios"
of,testosterone and estrogen
9009.4,will vary from males to females.
9011.3,But in order to get
those,right or as right
9013.48,as they can be without
other,"interventions,"
9015.473,you want to make sure you're
getting,enough quality sleep.
9017.89,How much sleep?
9018.61,Most people need about six to
eight,hours of sleep per night.
9021.58,"Waking up once,"
maybe,twice per night
9023.277,in the middle of the night
and,going back to sleep
9025.36,"is not such a big deal, but six"
to,eight hours of solid sleep
9028.15,would be ideal.
9028.788,Some people need a
little,bit less in order
9030.58,to function-- five hours.
9032.152,Some people need
a,little bit more.
9033.61,Developing teenagers and babies
and,kids need a lot more.
9036.125,People who are sick or
recovering,from injury
9038.0,need a lot more.
9038.74,We've done multiple
episodes,on sleep.
9040.99,We have a toolkit for
sleep,available free
9043.09,at hubermanlab.com.
9044.378,You go there.
9044.92,You don't even have to
sign,"up for the newsletter,"
9046.78,although you can if you want.
9047.988,Just go to a Toolkit for
Sleep,"under the menu,"
9050.23,and you'll be able
to,"download that,"
9052.0,or you can even just
view,it on the screen
9053.21,if you don't want
to,download it.
9054.1,It has lots of tools.
9054.975,We've done an episode
called,"""Perfect Your Sleep"""
9058.03,that has a lot of tools.
9060.067,They're all timestamped for you.
9061.4,"We've done a ""Master Your"
"Sleep""","episode, so lots of tools"
9063.52,to get your sleep right.
9064.52,Get your sleep right
if,you are wishing
9066.37,to conceive and/or to
simply,"have healthy biology,"
9069.82,"to be fertile, or otherwise."
9071.1,That's just fundamental.
9072.1,"Now, there are other"
things,to not do.
9075.49,"And those, again, fall into the"
somewhat,"obvious categories,"
9078.063,but I think a lot
of,people aren't
9079.48,aware of just how striking an
effect,these certain behaviors
9084.13,that you want to avoid can have
in,diminishing your fertility
9086.92,for both males and females.
9088.157,So let's talk about those.
9089.24,The first one is smoking.
9090.64,And when we talk
about,"smoking here,"
9092.14,we're talking about
smoking,nicotine
9094.66,and we're talking
about,smoking cannabis.
9096.73,"And indeed, there"
are,strong data--
9098.38,and I will put a
reference,to one
9099.97,of the better larger
analyses,of these data.
9102.25,There are strong data
showing,that cannabis
9104.38,reduces fertility.
9105.92,"Now, I can already hear"
the,"screams from the back,"
9108.49,although they're probably
fairly,"drawled out screams,"
9112.3,from the back of people
saying,they smoke cannabis
9114.95,and they had no
trouble,conceiving.
9116.92,"Certainly, there"
will,be exceptions.
9118.42,But whether or not
you're,"male or female,"
9120.34,smoking cannabis is a
bad,idea if you want
9122.53,to conceive a healthy child.
9123.85,Can you still conceive a healthy
child,while smoking cannabis?
9127.63,Probably certain people can.
9129.34,Many people will greatly
decrease,the probability
9132.85,of a healthy fertilization and
pregnancy,by smoking cannabis.
9136.4,There are excellent
data,to support that.
9138.87,"As well, nicotine,"
both,"smoked or vaped,"
9142.11,is going to disrupt the
process,of fertilization
9147.15,and can disrupt
pregnancy,dramatically.
9149.83,So just avoid it altogether.
9151.075,How does this happen?
9151.95,"Well, it turns out that smoking"
increases,what are called
9154.325,reactive oxygen species.
9155.74,This greatly
disrupts,the quality
9158.088,of the egg at the level of
the,spindle and mitochondria
9160.38,and a number of other features.
9161.82,"And in the sperm, turns out"
that,smoking doesn't necessarily
9165.45,disrupt the sperm
"directly,",although it
9167.34,can cause DNA
"fragmentation,",which
9170.07,can cause all sorts
of,"abnormalities,"
9171.9,"can prevent fertilization,"
can,lead to birth defects
9174.36,in the offspring.
9175.15,"But more importantly,"
it,increases
9177.72,what are called reactive oxygen
species,"in the seminal fluid,"
9180.45,in the semen that
contain,"the sperm,"
9182.2,"this very, under"
normal,"circumstances,"
9184.98,under healthy
"circumstances,",beautifully
9187.14,orchestrated chemistry of
fluid,that allows the sperm
9190.2,to thrive in their
trajectory,and attempt
9193.65,to fertilize the egg and
lead,to a healthy pregnancy.
9196.3,So if you are a smoker
and,"you want to conceive,"
9199.74,the best advice I can give
you,is to quit smoking.
9201.87,"And yes, that includes"
cannabis,as well.
9203.74,"Now, I am not somebody"
who,believes that cannabis
9205.83,across the board is not useful.
9207.22,There are medical applications
and,other applications.
9209.47,I talk about that in an
episode,all about cannabis
9212.16,for health and disease.
9213.3,"And notice, health"
was,in there too.
9214.8,"So you cannabis smokers,"
don't,come after me with--
9217.77,"I guess, whatever it"
is--,with bongs and pipes
9220.05,or whatever it is that
you,want-- or with vapes.
9222.15,"The point is that,"
while,it can be
9224.73,beneficial for
certain,"populations,"
9226.38,it's certainly bad for others.
9228.49,And if you're
trying,"to conceive,"
9230.55,it is bad for fertility and
for,a healthy pregnancy.
9233.88,"Now, that's smoking--"
and,"vaping, by the way."
9237.81,Vaping is included there.
9239.4,"Now, the next category of"
don'ts,relates to alcohol.
9243.42,"Now, everyone has heard that"
drinking,during pregnancy
9245.82,is a bad idea.
9247.05,You may have heard
and,some people
9248.49,have talked about
the,fact that there
9250.35,are cultures in
which,"they allow,"
9253.47,"if you will, or"
even,"condone, sadly,"
9256.23,one or two drinks
while,"pregnant,"
9258.18,provided it's just champagne
or,something of that sort.
9260.79,That is a terrible idea.
9262.45,I did an episode
all,"about alcohol,"
9264.52,both its potential
health,"effects,"
9266.73,of which there turned
out,to be zero.
9268.5,"And yes, that includes red wine."
9270.54,It is far better to
not,drink at all.
9272.462,And if you're going
to,"drink, the limit--"
9274.17,if you're a healthy
adult,who's not
9275.52,"trying to conceive,"
not,"pregnant,"
9276.895,and you don't have
issues,with alcoholism--
9278.76,is probably two
drinks,per week total.
9282.04,"That's right, two"
drinks,per week total.
9284.16,And that's the level
that,you really
9285.84,should consider if you're a
drinker,if you're somebody
9287.76,who's trying to conceive.
9288.9,"However, for a woman"
who,"becomes pregnant,"
9291.265,the total number of drinks
that,you should allow yourself
9293.64,per week while pregnant and
breastfeeding,is indeed zero.
9297.75,There is absolutely no evidence
that,"one can, quote, unquote,"
9300.87,"""get away"" with drinking"
during,pregnancy.
9303.15,"And people say, well, I had"
a,perfectly healthy child.
9304.86,"But, of course, you don't know"
what,the health of that child
9307.36,would have been had
you,not drank at all.
9309.48,"Now, I'm not here with any"
generally,strong stance
9311.97,against alcohol.
9312.78,I myself am somebody who
has,a drink every once
9316.68,"in a while, although I"
don't,consider myself
9318.73,somebody who has a strong
proclivity,for alcohol.
9321.6,"And of course, at"
this,"moment, I'm"
9323.85,not trying to conceive children
and,I'm certainly not pregnant.
9327.01,So that's safe for me.
9328.77,"But frankly, I haven't had"
a,drink in a very long time.
9331.69,And so I don't miss it.
9332.95,And that's me.
9333.54,But I do realize that a lot
of,"people enjoy alcohol,"
9336.84,and so it's that
two,drinks per week
9338.43,limit that really
sets,the upper limit
9340.86,and threshold beyond which
you,start running into issues
9343.26,with cellular mutation.
9345.12,You start running into issues
of,"oxidative stress, greatly"
9349.38,"increase cancer risk, in"
particular,breast cancer risk.
9351.9,All of that's covered in the
alcohol,episode that we did.
9354.96,You can find it
at,hubermanlab.com
9356.55,and timestamped if you want
to,navigate to specific topics
9359.32,"and so forth, find out all"
about,the data supporting
9361.56,the statements that I'm
"making,",so on and so forth.
9364.12,"Now, if you're somebody who's"
seeking,to conceive or you fall
9366.96,into this category that some
couples,describe themselves
9369.45,as we're not trying but
we're,not not trying--
9371.863,meaning they're not
using,"birth control,"
9373.53,they're kind of letting
chance,run its course--
9376.83,"well, then you"
should,definitely be
9378.6,aware of the data
showing,that even just
9381.09,"one bout, one bout of"
so-called,"binge drinking,"
9385.09,which is five to six drinks
in,"a given night or half day,"
9389.43,in a 12-hour period-- one
bout,"of five to six drinks,"
9392.97,if you're a woman
or,"you're a man,"
9395.25,greatly increases both the
likelihood,of mutations
9400.41,in the embryo that would
result,from a fertilization
9403.87,"and at the same time, for"
reasons,that should be
9405.87,obvious to you based on all
the,"biology we've talked about,"
9408.328,a greatly reduced
probability,of fertilization.
9411.07,"Now, that absolutely"
does,not mean
9412.83,that you should use the
ingestion,of five or six drinks
9415.38,as a method of birth control.
9417.48,That is not what
I'm,saying here.
9418.92,"What I'm saying is that, if"
you,go out on a given night
9422.55,and you have five or six
drinks,and you happen
9424.77,"to become pregnant,"
the,probability
9426.39,that that pregnancy will
be,disrupted in some way
9430.14,is greatly increased.
9431.64,What the exact consequences
"are,",no one can tell you.
9435.07,"But also, if you're somebody"
who,is interested in conceiving
9439.36,"a child, well,"
then,you absolutely
9441.34,should abstain from ingesting
drinks,more than one or two
9445.875,during the time in which
you're,"trying to conceive,"
9448.0,and ideally it would be zero.
9449.65,And you certainly would
want,to avoid drinking
9452.11,multiple drinks per night.
9453.46,And so this idea of going out
and,having three or four drinks
9456.97,or four or five
drinks,in a given
9458.83,night at a time in
which,you're also
9461.02,"trying to conceive children,"
the,"biology tells us,"
9464.74,the epidemiology tells us that
this,is just a terrible idea.
9467.65,It's going to reduce the
likelihood,of fertility
9470.26,and successful pregnancy.
9471.68,And if there is a
successful,"pregnancy,"
9473.72,"the word ""success"" needs"
to,"be in quotes, right?"
9476.38,"I mean, I think every parent--"
9478.45,"every species, for"
that,matter-- wants
9480.7,to increase the probability
of,having healthy offspring.
9484.52,"And so, to my mind anyway and to"
the,OB/GYNs and the urologists
9488.65,that are focused on
fertility,"that I spoke to,"
9490.9,"everyone will say,"
try,as hard as you
9493.48,can to avoid these so-called
binge,drinking episodes.
9496.535,"And again, these"
episodes,are one night
9498.16,of consuming five to six drinks.
9499.69,"Now, another important thing"
to,remember in this context
9502.03,is that the negative effects
of,consuming five or six drinks
9505.99,in a given night extend
over,many weeks following
9509.86,the ingestion of that alcohol.
9511.75,"If you're a male,"
what,that means
9514.15,is that's going to impact
the,quality of your sperm
9517.84,and greatly decrease
the,likelihood
9519.55,of successful fertilization
and/or,healthy pregnancy
9524.65,over the period of that entire
spermatogenesis,"window, which"
9528.46,"is, as we talked about before,"
60,"to 90 days, 60 to generate"
9532.492,the sperm and then some
additional,time for the sperm
9534.7,to be transported to the point
where,they could be ejaculated.
9538.11,If you're a woman and you have
five,or six drinks on a given
9540.61,"night, well, then you are going"
to,disrupt the quality not
9544.18,of just the egg that
eventually,ovulates
9546.85,but indeed the entire
pool,of follicles that
9549.34,leaves the ovarian
vault,in reserve
9551.38,and from which the one
egg,will be selected.
9553.85,"In other words, you are reducing"
the,quality of all of the eggs
9558.55,that you happen to
deploy,that month.
9560.26,"Now, some of you who were really"
following,the biology earlier
9562.928,"might say, well, what if"
I,have those five or six
9564.97,drinks during the time in which
I'm,"menstruating, just in which"
9568.15,there's bleeding present?
9569.77,"And therefore, I"
haven't,yet ovulated.
9572.51,Ah!
9573.01,But if you remember the
biology,we talked about earlier
9575.56,"specifically, there is a"
subset,of follicles and eggs
9579.29,that leave that ovarian reserve
quite,a bit before that one egg
9584.65,is selected for and ovulates.
9586.2,"And of course, there are all"
the,different hormonal cascades
9588.7,and the general milieu
of,the ovary which
9590.86,are important and
are,being regulated
9592.493,by different hormones.
9593.41,"And yes, indeed, the"
regulation,of those hormones
9595.96,is strongly impacted by
alcohol,through a number
9598.435,"of different pathways,"
through,the regulation
9600.31,of the neurotransmitter
GABA,up in the brain--
9602.893,it's actually a lot of
GABA,and GABA receptors
9604.81,"in the hypothalamus, the"
very,region from which
9606.79,"gonadotropin-releasing hormone,"
our,old friend from a couple
9609.55,hours ago in this
"discussion,",going
9612.07,to disrupt GnRH secretion.
9614.08,You can disrupt pituitary
function,with alcohol.
9617.14,"Again and again,"
what,we're seeing
9618.91,is that consuming more than
one,or two drinks per week
9622.75,of alcohol is really detrimental
to,the entire process
9625.96,of fertility and the entire
process,of healthy pregnancy.
9629.44,And that's true from both
the,"male side and the sperm,"
9632.17,and it's true from the
female,side and the egg.
9634.63,So my simple advice
on,this is if you
9636.58,are wishing to have a healthy
fertilization,"and pregnancy,"
9640.96,the best thing to do would
be,avoid alcohol altogether
9643.34,"and, if you are going to"
"drink,",to really limit
9645.298,that drinking to one or two
drinks,per week maximum.
9648.64,So those are the major don'ts.
9649.9,Really avoid excessive stress.
9651.67,"And I should mention,"
excessive,stress
9653.29,is not just best avoided by
getting,enough quality sleep
9655.63,at night.
9656.0,Although that is
the,primary way.
9657.49,There are other ways
to,avoid stress.
9658.9,We've done entire
episodes,"about this,"
9660.483,and we have a toolkit
related,to reducing stress
9662.56,"with very simple,"
zero-cost,tools.
9664.21,"Again, you can find all"
that,at hubermanlab.com.
9666.31,And I should
"mention,",if you want
9667.685,to find any episode
or,"topic or timestamp,"
9670.09,that website is keyword
search,available.
9673.9,So you can just go
to,"hubermanlab.com,"
9675.73,put into the search
function,"""stress tools,"""
9678.04,and a bunch of different
links,will pop up
9679.9,"related to those topics,"
likewise,"with sleep, likewise"
9683.075,with any number of
different,topics you
9684.7,might be interested in.
9685.7,So get enough quality sleep
and,thereby reduce stress
9689.05,and also directly buffer
stress,with real-time tools
9691.72,to buffer stress that I've
talked,about in the episodes
9694.81,that you can access.
9695.77,And there are ways to greatly
reduce,your overall level
9699.28,"of stress, to limit"
any,cortisol that's
9701.59,"released to early in the day,"
which,is when you want cortisol
9704.212,"released, and not have"
it,late in the day
9705.92,and so on and so forth.
9707.03,So reduce your stress.
9708.16,And as I just told
"you,","by all means,"
9713.07,do not drink more than
two,drinks per week.
9715.4,And zero is better than two.
9716.81,"If anyone tells you,"
"oh,","well, there's"
9718.46,all this resveratrol in red
"wine,","and that's good for us,"
9721.94,the data simply
tell,us there's not
9723.5,enough resveratrol in
red,wine to really have
9725.393,any positive health benefit.
9726.56,The data around
resveratrol,and health
9728.78,benefits itself is
under,question nowadays.
9731.33,Zero alcohol is better
than,any alcohol.
9734.18,Two drinks per
week,is the limit.
9735.8,"Also, limit or eliminate or"
avoid,nicotine and ideally
9741.83,"cannabis, smoking and vaping,"
at,the time in which you
9744.71,are trying to get pregnant.
9746.48,"And certainly, if"
you,"are pregnant,"
9748.07,"avoid all of the things, as"
best,"you can, that I just"
9750.8,described a moment ago.
9752.25,"Now, there are a couple of"
other,don'ts that are really
9754.542,important.
9755.19,One of the most important
don'ts,"relates to STIs,"
9757.79,or sexually-transmitted
infections.,
9759.77,Everyone who is sexually
active,should get an STI check.
9762.57,"In fact, if you go"
to,a fertility clinic
9764.66,or you go for sperm analysis
or,"you go for egg analysis,"
9767.12,almost always they
will,"do an STI check,"
9770.0,even if you happen to be in
a,"monogamous relationship,"
9772.4,even if you happen to
be,not sexually active
9774.233,and you're somebody
who,is seeking
9775.65,to use IVF with a sperm donor
or,something of that sort.
9778.01,Why would they do that?
9779.253,Why is there so much
concern,about that?
9780.92,Is it about avoiding
giving,birth
9783.26,to a child that has something
like,a herpes infection or HIV?
9788.383,"Well, certainly"
that's,"one reason,"
9789.8,but that's a down-the-line
"reason,",because
9791.45,at the time when someone
goes,into the clinic for one
9793.658,"of these sperm or egg analyses,"
that's,well in advance
9796.91,"of any pregnancy, right?"
9798.17,The reason is there
are,a number of STIs--
9800.9,in particular chlamydia-- for
which,it greatly increases
9804.35,the probability of miscarriage.
9805.79,So chlamydia is one of those
very,insidious and cryptic STIs
9810.39,"because a lot of people,"
both,"males and females,"
9812.39,don't even realize that
they,"have chlamydia,"
9814.49,and then they can
carry,chlamydia
9816.932,at the time in
which,"they conceive,"
9818.39,and then that can lead
to,ectopic pregnancies
9820.265,and/or miscarriages.
9821.48,"So by all means,"
get,an STI check
9823.94,if you are somebody who's
seeking,to conceive children
9826.52,or evaluating your
fertility,generally.
9829.43,Chlamydia can also have damaging
effects,on the epididymis
9831.98,and on the various other aspects
of,male reproductive health.
9835.04,"In the future, we"
will,do an episode
9836.54,all about sexual health.
9837.7,This is not the time for that.
9838.95,But get an STI
check,if your goal
9840.92,is to conceive a healthy child.
9842.66,"Now, the other thing that can"
have,a very negative impact
9845.21,on fertility and healthy
pregnancy,is a viral infection.
9850.22,"For instance, if a male has"
had,a severe viral illness--
9853.353,and this could be any number
of,"different viral illnesses,"
9855.77,from flu to cold or any
number,of different viruses.
9858.11,Pick your favorite virus--
9860.66,in the previous 70
to,"90 days, that"
9863.33,can greatly diminish the
number,and/or quality of sperm.
9867.99,So that's really important.
9869.115,This is also important if you're
going,to go in and do a sperm
9871.698,analysis and you had
a,viral infection
9873.44,in the previous 70 to 90 days.
9875.385,"Well, then you need"
to,be aware of that
9877.01,because it could greatly impact
the,parameters of that sperm
9879.68,analysis.
9880.37,"Likewise, for women, if you've"
had,a serious viral infection
9882.98,"in the previous 30 days,"
does,that mean you should not
9884.87,try and conceive?
9885.578,"Not necessarily, but you should"
talk,to your OB/GYN about that.
9889.28,There are data showing
that,viral infection--
9892.55,in particular of influenza--
in,the mother in the first
9895.34,trimester of pregnancy has some
correlation--,it's not 100%--
9899.48,but some correlation with
negative,mental health outcomes
9902.54,of the offspring sometime
"later,",including schizophrenia.
9904.975,This is some of
the,work that was
9906.35,done at Caltech a
number,of years ago
9909.14,"and other laboratories, as well."
9911.15,Those data are still
being,built up over time.
9913.79,"Again, it's not one-for-one."
9915.44,It's not causal.
9916.68,So if you did get an influenza
or,a cold or other kind
9919.715,of viral infection during
the,first trimester
9921.59,"or any trimester of pregnancy,"
I,"don't want to cause alarm,"
9924.5,but you should talk to
your,OB/GYN about this.
9926.96,"The goal, of course, is to"
avoid,viral illness at any time
9929.45,when you're trying to conceive
or,have a healthy pregnancy.
9932.66,"But of course, sometimes"
people,"will get ill,"
9934.76,and the children can turn out
to,be perfectly normal and fine.
9938.078,But it is something
that,you want to avoid.
9939.87,And it will impact
your,"egg analysis,"
9942.29,and it will impact
sperm,analysis.
9944.385,And one thing I found
really,surprising
9946.01,in researching this episode
was,that 1 in 25 men
9951.35,carry a copy of a mutation
for,cystic fibrosis.
9955.68,"Now, some of you are probably"
familiar,with cystic fibrosis
9958.37,as a condition that
can,cause issues
9960.952,"with the lungs, the"
accumulation,of fluid
9962.66,in the lungs or other tissues.
9964.61,"Cystic fibrosis,"
in,order to express
9967.07,that way of accumulation
of,"fluid in the lungs,"
9969.11,you really need two copies.
9970.67,You need two mutant copies
or,you need two copies
9973.88,of the cystic fibrosis gene.
9976.52,1 in 25 men will
carry,just one copy
9979.28,and therefore will not have any
symptoms,of cystic fibrosis.
9982.82,But those 1 in 25
men,will have defects
9987.08,in the architecture of
the,"vas deferens, the duct"
9990.62,through which the
ejaculate,needs
9992.6,to pass in order to
eventually,be ejaculated out
9996.5,of the urethra.
9997.53,And so what that means
is,that these men can
10000.22,have what appears to
be,normal semen volume
10002.26,but that they won't have
normal,numbers of sperm.
10005.62,And that's not because of a
deficit,in making the sperm.
10008.553,The testes can
function,just fine.
10009.97,The brain and the
pituitary,are communicating
10012.37,with the testes just fine.
10013.64,But that literally
the,passageway
10015.28,by which those sperm arrive
within,the seminal fluid
10017.8,and are eventually
ejaculated,is disrupted
10020.26,by the cystic fibrosis gene.
10021.7,"Luckily, if somebody has just"
one,copy of the cystic fibrosis
10025.03,gene and they're male
and,"this is the issue,"
10028.0,the vas deferens either can be
repaired,by a urologist who's
10033.55,expert in the surgical
repair,of vas deferens
10035.77,or sperm can be extracted from
the,"testicle directly, which"
10038.908,might sound like a
painful,"procedure,"
10040.45,but I believe
"nowadays,",in talking
10042.64,with various experts
on,"this, it turns out"
10044.5,that it can be done with
a,minimum of discomfort.
10046.93,"And certainly, if the goal"
is,"to have a healthy child,"
10049.24,you're going to
need,"those sperm,"
10050.44,so you're going to want to
get,"them one way or the other,"
10052.815,regardless of the discomfort.
10054.048,"Now, before getting"
into,some of the things
10055.84,that you can do in
the,positive sense
10057.55,to increase your
"fertility,",we do
10059.093,need to touch on just
a,few other things
10060.76,that you want to avoid
in,order to avoid
10063.04,diminishing your fertility.
10064.54,And this mainly
relates,"to males,"
10066.04,but it will also be
relevant,to females.
10068.625,"And of course, when I say"
also,"relevant to females,"
10070.75,"I'm referring to the fact that,"
if,it's a woman and a man who
10073.84,"are trying to conceive,"
then,"she, of course,"
10076.585,is going to be interested in her
egg,quality but also the sperm
10079.21,quality.
10079.78,"And of course,"
there,are women who
10081.197,are conceiving by way of sperm
"donor,",through IVF or IUI
10084.79,or otherwise.
10085.57,"But in any case, the need"
to,understand and maximize
10090.76,the quality of both the egg
and,the sperm is paramount.
10093.44,So in order for men to maximize
the,"quality of their sperm,"
10096.58,as I mentioned
"earlier,",does not seem
10098.5,to be a big difference
whether,or not they use boxers
10100.81,or briefs or whether or not
"they,","quote, unquote, ""go"
10103.15,"commando,"" they don't wear any"
boxers,or briefs of any kind.
10107.09,"However, it is important to"
keep,the testicles cool enough.
10110.62,They need to be about
2,degrees cooler
10112.42,than the rest of the body.
10113.93,And there are a number of
different,ways to do that.
10116.36,"As I mentioned before,"
avoid,going in hot tubs
10118.695,during the period
in,which you're
10120.07,trying to conceive children.
10122.65,You should also
avoid,going in saunas
10124.413,during the period
in,which you are
10125.83,trying to conceive children.
10126.997,"And if you do go in the sauna,"
you,can bring an ice pack there
10129.67,and you can put it
on,the testicles
10131.89,in order to offset
the,heat of the sauna
10135.1,and keep the testicles
cool,while in the sauna.
10138.608,The other thing that you'll
definitely,want to do
10140.65,is avoid putting a laptop
or,any other hot device
10143.62,directly onto your lap.
10144.91,There are a number
of,different devices
10148.362,that you can put on your lap.
10149.57,You could put books
or,a box or there
10151.13,are these devices that
are,designed to dispel
10153.23,the heat from the laptop.
10154.48,"I would say, if you're"
trying,"to conceive,"
10156.23,just keep the laptop
off,of your lap.
10157.933,Just put it on a table or
standing,desk or whatever.
10160.1,Just keep it off of your lap.
10162.2,"Also, there are some"
really,interesting data
10164.3,showing that the amount of
time,"that men spend sitting,"
10167.288,regardless of whether
or,not they sit
10168.83,with their ankle on their
opposite,knee or with knees
10173.03,"spread, the classic man spread"
"stance,",or any other kind
10177.41,of seated stance is
going,to increase
10179.81,the temperature of the
scrotum,for reasons that
10182.815,are somewhat
obvious,if you think
10184.19,about the architecture
of,all this.
10185.52,"I think both men and women, if"
you,"put enough thought to it,"
10187.25,"you go, oh yeah, that would"
increase,the temperature.
10189.458,Obviously avoid seat heaters
in,cars or otherwise.
10193.19,But reducing the total amount
of,time that you spend seated
10197.3,is really important if you
want,to keep the temperature
10200.3,milieu of the scrotum
optimal,for sperm quality
10203.33,and fertilization.
10204.297,And as I mentioned
"earlier,",it's going
10205.88,to be important to make
sure,that your legs are not
10208.61,really big to the point
where,they are creating
10211.73,a hotter than is healthy
environment,for the scrotum
10215.36,and testicles.
10216.08,So a hotter than normal
environment,for the testicles
10219.53,can be caused by legs
that,"are very large,"
10221.96,upper thighs that are very
large,due to obesity or due
10225.71,to those upper thighs
being,too muscular.
10227.84,"So by all means,"
don't,skip leg day.
10229.37,But be aware that if
you're,somebody who's
10230.78,"trying to conceive,"
you,want to do whatever
10232.572,you can to reduce the
temperature,of the scrotum
10236.06,or at least not let it
get,too hot for too long.
10240.09,So I can think of
all,sorts of reasons
10243.297,now that men are
going,to come up with
10244.88,to do the man spread
stance,of their knees
10247.97,"really far apart, even further"
if,they have large legs.
10250.46,That's not a discussion
we,"want to have here,"
10252.11,and that's not really what
today's,discussion is about.
10253.94,Really the principle is
what's,"most important, which"
10256.107,is to keep the
temperature,of the scrotum
10257.99,and testicles lower than
the,rest of your body.
10261.33,There's a direct blood flow from
the,body to the testicle that
10264.38,provides blood flow.
10265.28,It's designed in a way
that,that blood pathway
10269.78,should be outside the
body,and as far away
10272.42,from the body as
possible,in order
10274.31,to get the temperature
milieu,of the scrotum
10276.2,and testicle correct for
healthy,sperm quality.
10278.93,"Now, a topic that is sure"
to,be a bit controversial--
10281.417,but it really shouldn't
be,"because the data,"
10283.25,"at least to me, are very clear--"
10285.8,is this issue of phone
use,and sperm quality.
10289.91,"Now, this can open up a"
whole,array of issues related
10294.17,"to things like EMFs,"
and,you've got people
10296.21,out there who have ideas about
5G,and all of this stuff.
10300.14,That is not what this
discussion,is about.
10302.06,The discussion I'm about to have
with,you relates to the fact
10305.15,that the electromagnetic fields
and,the heat-related effects
10309.32,of smartphones can indeed
have,a detrimental effect
10313.25,"on sperm quality and, yes,"
"indeed,",on testosterone levels
10316.73,as well.
10317.54,I'm going to refer
you,to a paper.
10319.09,We will link it in the
show,note captions.
10320.84,The title of this paper is
Effects,"of Mobile Phone
10323.45 Usage on Sperm Quality.
10324.95 No time-dependent
relationship on usage.
10327.71 A systematic review and
updated meta-analysis."
10330.24,This is the paper
that,came out in 2021
10333.2,and talks about the fact
that,phones emit a radio
10336.02,frequency electromagnetic
"waves,",which
10338.18,"are called RF, radio frequency,"
"EMWs,","electromagnetic waves,"
10342.5,at a low level between 80
and,"2,200 megahertz that"
10346.85,can be absorbed by the
human,body-- we know this.
10349.31,This is not controversial-- and
have,potential adverse effects
10351.98,"on brain, heart,"
endocrine,"system,"
10353.27,and reproductive function.
10354.353,That has been established.
10356.12,"Keep in mind, there is"
basically,no controversy
10359.12,that radio frequency
waves,and EMFs
10361.55,can have a negative impact
on,biological tissues.
10363.81,"The question is, how intense"
are,those radiofrequency waves
10367.91,"and EMFs, and how"
detrimental,are those
10371.225,on those biological tissues?
10373.22,It's a matter of degrees.
10374.73,But there is very
little,controversy as to
10376.55,whether or not they have an
effect,on biological tissues.
10378.925,And I'm aware of absolutely
zero,data showing
10381.29,that they can have a positive
effect,on biological tissues.
10383.78,Since what we're mainly talking
about,"now are smartphones,"
10386.51,we want to separate out the
heat,effects of smartphones
10388.91,from the EMFs
related,to the fact
10390.74,that they are Wi-Fi
smartphones,or they're
10393.23,using cellular
towers,"and Wi-Fi, one"
10396.74,or the other or a combination.
10398.31,So there are a number of
different,things in the phone
10400.19,that could be detrimental.
10401.21,We need to separate those out.
10402.14,Why?
10402.74,"Well, because you"
might,have heard
10404.33,that carrying your
phone,in your pocket
10405.955,can reduce your testosterone
levels,and sperm count.
10408.59,"And guess what, that is true."
10410.96,The data contained
within,this meta-analyses
10413.24,and other meta-analyses
clearly,point out
10415.67,that it can reduce sperm count
and,maybe testosterone levels
10419.42,"significantly, but certainly"
sperm,count and motility
10422.33,significantly.
10423.11,It reduces sperm quality.
10424.85,So should you avoid putting your
phone,"in your pocket, certainly"
10428.97,your front pocket?
10429.72,"I would suggest yes,"
if,you are somebody
10432.02,who is seeking to conceive.
10433.82,I'm not somebody who is going
to,stop using my smartphone.
10436.237,I don't expect anyone's going
to,stop using their smartphone.
10438.778,"The question is, should you"
carry,it in your front pocket
10441.41,if you're a male?
10442.49,"I think, to be on the"
safe,"side, the answer"
10444.59,is probably avoid doing
that,too much of the time.
10447.01,"Ideally, don't do it at all."
10448.81,"Then people will say, well,"
what,if I turn off the Wi-Fi
10452.98,or I turn off the
cellular,access?
10455.5,Then is it still a problem?
10457.07,"Well, it's a problem due to"
the,heat-related effects.
10459.91,"And then people say,"
"well,",I don't actually
10461.77,feel the heat of the phone.
10462.895,It doesn't get that warm.
10464.05,But the temperature effects
of,"the phone, it turns out,"
10468.7,"are enough, even under"
conditions,in which people
10471.49,don't report it to be
uncomfortably,"warm, that it can"
10474.4,change the temperature
milieu,of the testicle
10476.483,in ways that can
diminish,sperm quality.
10478.15,How much and how that
relates,to fertility
10480.82,"and healthy pregnancy,"
not,"clear, but since we're"
10483.49,talking about things
to,"avoid, if your goal"
10485.59,is to have a healthy
fertilization,"and pregnancy,"
10489.145,"well, then, by all means,"
just,don't carry it
10491.02,in your front pocket.
10491.83,"Then people say, well,"
what,about back pocket
10493.27,or what about backpack?
10494.32,"Look, it's very"
clear,that avoiding
10497.17,being too close to the phone is
probably,better for your sperm
10500.38,quality than putting the phone
very,close to your testicles
10504.19,or anywhere else on your body.
10505.93,But it's also the reality
that,most people are going
10508.24,to carry a phone nowadays.
10510.28,It's just the reality.
10511.34,I think the current estimates--
and,it's discussed in this
10514.84,paper-- that 90% of the human
population,has a smartphone--
10519.04,"90%, which is incredible-- the"
adult,"population, of course."
10522.43,Although a lot of kids
have,"them, as well."
10524.18,So this paper goes on to detail
a,number of different studies
10526.78,and outcomes from studies.
10527.89,But basically what they find--
and,here I'm paraphrasing--
10530.307,is that the data indicate
that,sperm quality declines
10533.855,when people start
using,a mobile phone.
10535.48,So from the point they
start,"using a mobile phone,"
10537.25,regardless of the usage
time--,this is important.
10539.45,It used to be thought that it
was,four hours a day or more
10542.2,of holding your phone or having
that,phone close to your body
10545.63,was going to diminish
sperm,quality.
10547.13,It turns out that it's
not,related to usage time.
10549.01,That's even the
title,of the paper.
10550.48,It's just the fact
that,people are
10551.897,using mobile phones is reducing
sperm,count and quality.
10555.7,That's the reality.
10556.66,Is it entirely responsible for
all,the reductions in sperm
10559.918,quality and maybe
even,the reductions
10561.46,in testosterone levels that
we're,observing from decade
10563.752,to decade going forward?
10565.39,I doubt that's the case.
10566.68,Is it likely to be one
of,the major players?
10569.14,I've got my bet on the fact
that,it is based on the data
10573.1,that I've observed.
10573.97,And so if any of you
would,like to peruse
10575.83,"the data in this meta-analysis,"
they're,quite good.
10578.02,This study looked at 18 studies
that,"include 4,280 samples."
10582.34,They were able to
separate,out the radio
10584.62,frequency versus
the,"heat effects,"
10586.39,and they were able to eliminate
this,"time of usage variable,"
10590.68,that previously we thought
if,you were exposed
10592.63,to a lot of cell
phone,"contact, then"
10595.163,it was far worse than if you
were,exposed to a little bit.
10597.58,"Turns out, if you're"
exposed,"to any at all,"
10599.23,you're going to
diminish,sperm quality.
10600.77,What does that mean?
10601.51,Does that mean
that,no matter what
10602.71,"you do, if you own a"
"smartphone,",that you're going
10604.793,to diminish sperm quality?
10606.01,"I think the short answer is yes,"
but,that you can mitigate it.
10609.43,What might you do?
10610.48,"Well, keeping your phone away"
from,your groin or as far
10612.898,from your groin as
possible,if you're
10614.44,a male who's wishing to
conceive,and maybe even a male
10616.69,who's wishing to maximize his
testosterone,levels because it
10619.99,does appear that radiofrequency
waves,and the heat
10622.39,from the phone--
10623.2,"so both of those factors,"
independently,"and together,"
10626.11,of course--
10626.8,can disrupt the Leydig
cells,of the testes
10628.99,and the production
of,"testosterone,"
10630.58,and intratesticular
testosterone,is
10632.89,important for sperm production.
10634.42,The exact biological variables
leading,to all of these changes
10637.36,isn't exactly clear.
10638.78,But if you're like
"me,","you say, OK,"
10640.36,probably not a problem for most
males,to carry their phone.
10643.72,But probably best to not
carry,it in the front pocket.
10646.66,Maybe even avoid carrying it
in,the back pocket as well.
10649.01,"Again, in the future,"
we,will have an episode
10650.885,all about Bluetooth.
10651.85,We'll talk about
various,aspects of EMFs.
10654.76,It's a super
interesting,data set.
10657.01,And it's a data set for which
there's,a ton of controversy.
10660.16,It's really
"interesting,","however,"
10661.995,and there are more and more
quality,data coming out
10664.12,all the time.
10664.713,"And I think, going"
"forward,",we are
10666.13,"going to see that, indeed,"
there,are some negative effects
10668.547,of smartphones related to
both,the radio frequency
10671.35,transmission and the fact
that,they generate heat.
10675.67,"And in general, heat is not"
good,for biological tissues.
10678.77,So any discussion
about,heat and sperm
10680.71,and how heat is
detrimental,to sperm
10683.68,has to raise this
issue,of whether or not
10685.54,cold is good for the testicle.
10687.4,"OK, well, now there's"
a,lot of data starting
10689.83,to come out about
the,"positive effects,"
10692.41,"the positive biological effects,"
of,deliberate cold exposure
10696.79,on different aspects
of,"brain biology,"
10699.79,such as the release of
dopamine,"and norepinephrine,"
10702.07,and on the biology of the
"body,",to some extent metabolism
10705.4,but more so the impact on
brown,"fat stores, which"
10707.95,"are good for us, so-called"
brown,fat thermogenesis.
10710.56,There's a lot related to
deliberate,"cold exposure,"
10713.3,and we've done entire episodes
on,deliberate cold exposure.
10716.05,"Again, you can find"
that,at hubermanlab.com.
10717.91,We did a guest
episode,with an expert
10719.95,on the use of cold for
health,and performance
10722.518,with my colleague Craig Heller
from,Stanford Department
10724.81,of Biology.
10725.38,We also have a toolkit on how to
apply,"deliberate, cold exposure"
10729.64,for health for both
females,and for males--
10732.31,"for sports performance,"
cognitive,"performance, mood,"
10734.69,"sleep, et cetera."
10735.43,"You can find all that,"
"again,",at hubermanlab.com.
10737.472,Totally zero cost.
10739.055,"Just go into the menu, go to"
"newsletter,","and scroll down,"
10741.43,and you'll find those.
10744.07,When thinking about
sperm,"quality,"
10746.29,we want remember that
excessive,heat is bad.
10748.86,"Now, does that mean that"
deliberate,cold is good?
10751.77,"Well, it turns out that one"
of,the major causes of lowered
10755.76,sperm count and overall
reduced,sperm quality that's
10760.32,quite common is the presence
of,what's called a varicocele.
10762.87,A varicocele is kind of like
varicose,veins of the veins
10766.8,that innervate the testicle.
10768.6,And what it
essentially,does is it
10771.78,means that blood will pool
in,the testicular region.
10776.19,It can't circulate back to
the,body quickly enough.
10778.56,"And therefore, the temperature"
of,that environment increases.
10780.75,There are some other
things,that varicoceles
10782.583,do which can be obstructive
at,the physical level.
10784.71,So they're not just
temperature,related.
10786.69,It's pretty clear that using
deliberate,cold exposure
10790.47,can be healthy for the
sperm,because of the ways
10793.11,not that cold directly supports
testosterone,or sperm quality
10798.12,but rather because
cold,reduces heat.
10801.12,So you will find
available,online--
10805.505,I think they're
actually,called--
10806.88,"forgive me, but that's"
what,they're called.
10808.26,I didn't name them--
called,snowballs.
10809.843,These are-- they're sort of
like,gel pack cold briefs
10814.53,that you can buy and men will
wear,for some period of time.
10817.38,I don't think you
wear,them all day.
10818.88,You wear them for
some,period of time.
10820.86,A lot of people are now using
cold,showers and ice baths
10824.04,and circulating cold baths
or,going into a cold ocean
10826.38,or lake for any number
of,different reasons
10828.482,I talked about earlier.
10829.44,"I, myself, start every"
day,with either a one
10832.32,to three-minute
cold,shower or a one
10833.98,to three-minute
immersion,up to my neck
10836.52,"in a cold bath, cold"
"water,","circulating water,"
10840.84,or a cold shower.
10841.743,I do that mainly for the
psychological,effects
10843.66,related to the long
lasting,increases
10845.4,in dopamine and epinephrine.
10846.935,But there are
other,data starting
10848.31,to come out showing that
that,sort of approach
10851.37,or similar approaches can
increase,testosterone levels
10854.34,and maybe even sperm
"counts,",can reduce
10855.99,cortisol late in the evening if
the,cold exposure is done early
10858.54,"in the day, so on and so forth."
10859.832,So a lot of interesting data
coming,out in really good
10862.17,journals that are peer-reviewed
and,"so on-- in humans,"
10866.783,"I should mention, those"
studies,are done in humans--
10868.95,to support the use of
deliberate,cold exposure.
10870.99,"But again, if you're going to"
use,deliberate cold exposure
10873.407,to improve sperm
"quality,",can it work?
10875.31,"Yes, indeed, it can"
"work,",either indirectly
10877.8,by increasing
testosterone,or directly
10879.75,by improving sperm quality.
10881.13,But both of those effects
are,likely to be indirect
10883.83,by virtue of reducing the
temperature,of the testicle
10886.74,"overall, not because there's"
any,sort of magic effect of cold
10890.49,on the testicle.
10891.42,"Now, I have to imagine"
that,"a number of you,"
10893.253,in particular the females
listening,"to this,"
10895.41,"are going to say, is"
deliberate,cold exposure--
10898.318,"and for that matter, is"
deliberate,"heat exposure,"
10900.36,like sauna or hot tub--
good,"or bad for the ovary,"
10903.63,"for eggs, and for fertility?"
10905.04,"Now, there are fewer data"
to,"look to, unfortunately."
10909.3,But what we do know is that
deliberate,cold exposure
10912.45,done in the way that
I,just described-- one
10914.26,"to three minutes a day,"
ideally,"early in the day,"
10916.438,through cold shower or
immersion,up to the neck--
10918.48,doesn't have to be an ice bath.
10919.772,It could be cold
circulating,water or even
10922.14,non-circulating cold water.
10923.58,And people will
"say,","well, how cold?"
10925.14,I should have
mentioned,that before.
10926.64,How cold?
10928.15,There is no way I can
tell,you exactly how
10930.567,"cold the water should be,"
because,"for some people,"
10932.65,60 degrees Fahrenheit
will,be exceedingly cold.
10934.998,"For other people, 40 degrees is"
going,to be more appropriate.
10937.54,How cold should you make it?
10938.8,If you're going to embrace
these,"practices, you want--"
10941.81,"according to the literature,"
what,you want to do
10943.81,is make it
uncomfortably,cold such
10946.03,that you really want
to,"get out, but safe."
10948.28,You don't want to go into
30-degree,water immediately.
10951.19,You can actually have a heart
attack,and die if you do that.
10953.69,So you want to progress
gradually,into the cold.
10956.86,So you don't want to shock
your,system too much.
10959.02,Although it is the adrenaline
evoked,"by that [GASPS],,"
10961.84,that quickening or
shortening,or elimination
10964.06,of the breath for a
short,period of time
10965.727,when you get into
uncomfortably,cold water that
10967.9,correlates with or is
actually,the reflection of--
10970.57,would be more accurate to
say--,the release of adrenaline
10972.97,and then dopamine
and,"so forth, which"
10974.83,has been very well documented.
10976.64,"So uncomfortably cold,"
but,safe to stay in.
10980.27,And I cannot tell you an exact
number,that is uncomfortably
10983.98,cold but safe for you.
10985.1,It's going to differ
person,by person.
10986.41,You want to figure that out.
10987.31,Just like I can't tell you how
much,weight that you should
10989.727,squat in order to achieve
some,effective resistance
10992.175,training for the
"legs,",it's going
10993.55,to differ depending
on,your strength
10996.01,and your prior
experience,and so forth.
10997.73,So ease into it.
10998.53,Be safe.
10999.22,But it does appear
that,"both for men,"
11001.38,for reasons I talked about a
few,"minutes ago, and for women"
11005.7,"that deliberate, cold"
exposure,can be beneficial
11008.94,for fertility and for
hormone,"production,"
11011.61,but in particular for females
in,terms of regulating cortisol
11015.145,and for hormone production.
11016.27,"Now, you might say, OK,"
getting,into cold is stressful.
11018.3,How can that be helpful
for,regulating stress?
11020.07,"Well, it turns out, when"
you,"get into the cold,"
11022.028,you get a big
surge,in adrenaline
11023.46,"and then dopamine, which"
is,"very long lasting,"
11025.44,provided that's done in
the,early part of the day.
11027.7,"So I would say, not"
too,close to sleep.
11030.09,Then what you do is you restrict
your,maximum cortisol release
11033.3,to a period earlier in
the,day that buffers--
11037.32,"reduces, that is--"
the,likelihood
11039.15,that you would have excessive
amounts,of cortisol later
11041.907,"in the day, which not"
only,can disrupt sleep
11043.74,but is correlated with a number
of,other hormonal effects that
11047.43,are not good for
us,and therefore
11048.96,not good for fertility.
11050.1,So here what I'm
describing,are positive
11051.99,yet indirect effects of
a,cold on hormone levels
11056.49,both in males and in females.
11059.08,"So for men, we talked about"
increased,"testosterone,"
11061.68,improved sperm quality
that,was indirect.
11063.75,You're reducing the
temperature,of the testicle.
11066.12,But it's not that cold
itself,is positively
11068.262,impacting those things.
11069.22,Does that make sense?
11069.69,Heat is bad.
11070.48,"Therefore, reducing"
temperature,is good.
11072.33,"Likewise, with females,"
deliberate,cold exposure
11075.39,can be good for the
overall,"fertility process,"
11078.15,not because cold is good
for,the ovary or being
11081.24,cold is good for the ovary
or,for luteinizing hormone
11084.82,or for follicle-stimulating
hormone,or anything
11086.79,"else like that, but rather that"
using,deliberate cold exposure
11091.02,as a way to restrict
stress,in a deliberate
11093.36,way to a particular
time,of day increases
11096.33,"the release of cortisol,"
"then,",and indirectly reduces
11099.427,the amount of cortisol
that's,released
11101.01,at other times along
the,24-hour cycle.
11104.05,So these are positive
yet,indirect effects.
11106.36,So if you're a woman who really
is,interested in exploring
11109.71,deliberate cold exposure or
who,enjoys it or is already
11112.5,doing it and you're
wishing,"to conceive, great."
11115.11,Explore it.
11115.825,"Do it safely, of"
"course,",but explore it
11117.45,and continue to do it.
11118.36,"However, if you're somebody"
who,just hates the cold
11120.33,and doesn't want to
go,"anywhere near it,"
11121.65,there's no reason to think
that,"you absolutely need it,"
11123.6,"provided that your stress,"
your,"sleep, and other factors"
11125.97,are all being
carried,out properly.
11127.578,The next things that
we'll,talk about
11129.12,in terms of positive
things,or things
11130.98,that we can do in order
to,maximize fertility
11133.41,for both females and
males,are the things
11135.39,that you also generally
hear,about elsewhere.
11137.91,Right along with sleep and
avoiding,alcohol and avoiding
11141.09,"nicotine and avoiding cannabis,"
avoiding,excessive heat
11144.06,"for the testicle,"
avoiding,"excessive stress,"
11146.88,is that you want to try
to,get enough exercise.
11151.65,Why would exercise have
anything,to do with any of this?
11154.57,"Well, exercise-- and that"
is,both a combination
11157.53,of resistance training and
cardiovascular,exercise--
11159.9,is going to improve the
health,of the mitochondria--
11162.39,"in particular,"
cardiovascular,exercise.
11164.352,And I realize that for you
fitness,"experts out there,"
11166.56,"any time someone says ""cardio,"""
people,"kind of roll their eyes,"
11169.185,"like, what is that?"
11170.25,There's endurance training.
11171.6,There's interval training.
11172.71,There's HIIT training.
11173.73,There's sprints.
11174.467,There's all sorts
of,different things.
11176.05,Some of those overlap.
11176.79,Some of them are separate.
11178.02,"Indeed, that's the case."
11179.25,But we can use a general
rule,"of thumb here, which"
11182.28,"is that, for most people,"
getting,anywhere from 30
11185.22,and ideally 45 to 60
minutes,of exercise per day
11189.24,"for six days per week,"
maybe,even seven--
11191.49,but most people like to
take,a day off or need
11193.56,to take a complete
day,off each week--
11195.18,six to seven days
per,week is going
11196.86,to be good for mitochondrial
health,and function.
11199.342,It's also going to impact
all,"the other things,"
11201.3,"like quality sleep,"
"mood,","reducing stress,"
11203.55,and so on and so forth.
11204.67,So exercise we can handle pretty
quickly,by just saying everyone
11208.65,should be doing it.
11209.82,"Now, when people are pregnant,"
they,"might have to, of course,"
11212.92,change the amount of exercise
or,the type of exercise
11215.148,that they're doing.
11215.94,There are varying
opinions,"on that,"
11217.398,but certainly the type of
exercise,and the amount
11220.35,can vary when
people,are pregnant.
11221.86,But if you're
seeking,"to conceive,"
11223.497,getting enough exercise
is,good because it's
11225.33,good for the mitochondria.
11226.413,The mitochondria are present in
that,mid region of the sperm.
11230.34,And mitochondria are critical
for,chromosomal segregation
11234.48,and the spindle
and,other aspects
11236.7,of the formation of a
healthy,"egg, ovulation,"
11238.89,and fertilization in the female.
11240.228,One thing that I
know,a lot of people
11241.77,are interested in nowadays is
so-called,intermittent fasting
11244.77,or time-restricted feeding.
11246.3,"I mean, let's be fair, everybody"
is,restricting their feeding
11248.877,time because hopefully
everybody,is sleeping
11250.71,at some point in
the,"24-hour cycle,"
11252.51,and nobody is eating
while,they are sleeping.
11255.33,"That said, many"
people,are employing
11257.97,a so-called eight-hour feeding
window,or a 10-hour feeding
11260.562,window or a 12-hour
feeding,window.
11262.02,"And indeed, there are some data"
to,support the idea that that
11265.005,can be a good thing for a number
of,different biological and
11268.08,health parameters.
11268.9,"However, there are"
also,"a lot of data,"
11271.832,"especially recently,"
pointing,to the fact
11273.54,that your overall
number,of calories
11275.97,and the quality of
your,food sources
11277.74,is going to be the most
important,variable.
11279.93,And some people simply find
that,time-restricted feeding--
11282.69,"intermittent fasting,"
as,it's also called--
11285.15,is just a convenient
way,to ensure
11287.07,that your total
intake,of calories
11289.23,is not excessive
for,what you need.
11291.27,"Now, with all that"
"said,",there is evidence
11294.21,that I've covered
in,a solo episode
11295.703,and will soon have
an,expert guest
11297.12,on showing that time-restricted
feeding,can have
11301.32,certain positive outcomes
for,"various aspects of organ,"
11305.04,"cellular, and tissue health."
11307.23,This is somewhat
"controversial,",but there
11309.03,"is growing evidence that,"
by,restricting your feeding
11311.58,"window to, say, 8 hours"
or,"10 hours or 12 hours,"
11314.55,that it is better than if
you,were to eat over a longer
11317.1,period of each 24-hour cycle.
11319.56,"But again, the data"
are,still incoming.
11321.625,The reason we want to talk
about,"time-restricted feeding,"
11324.0,intermittent fasting
is,that a lot of people
11326.07,do use it because
they,find it easier
11328.29,to not eat at certain periods
of,their 24-hour cycle
11331.47,than to restrict calories.
11332.79,"But again, keep in mind, you"
have,to restrict calories
11336.132,if your goal is to
maintain,or lose
11337.59,"weight, a discussion"
that,we've covered
11339.87,in that episode on
intermittent,fasting
11341.79,and in the episode
with,Dr. Layne Norton
11343.92,and that we will cover in
other,episodes in the future.
11348.16,So refer to those episodes
at,hubermanlab.com
11350.79,if you would like to learn more
about,"intermittent fasting,"
11353.31,per se.
11354.06,"For sake of this conversation,"
a,number of people
11356.7,"are probably asking, if"
I,restrict my feeding
11359.61,to a certain window each
24,hours because that's
11362.983,what's convenient or
because,I'm excited
11364.65,about the potential
positive,effects
11366.18,of intermittent
"fasting,",is that going
11369.03,to disrupt the likelihood
of,fertility and thereby
11373.5,a healthy pregnancy?
11374.67,And the short answer to
that,"is, if you are a female"
11377.73,and you are having regular
menstrual,cycles that
11379.95,is a fairly
consistent,duration--
11382.45,so maybe it's 21
"days,",maybe it's
11384.24,"35, or anywhere in"
"between,",but it's
11385.83,fairly consistent
from,month to month--
11387.488,and you are following
intermittent,"fasting,"
11389.28,time-restricted
"feeding,","well, then"
11391.14,chances are pretty
good,that it's not
11393.48,disrupting your fertility and
likelihood,of fertilization
11397.91,and a healthy pregnancy.
11398.91,"Of course, during pregnancy,"
you,need to talk to your doctor
11401.94,and make sure that you're
eating,in a way that's
11403.98,supportive both of you and
of,the developing fetus.
11406.41,That's extremely important.
11407.86,I am not aware of
data,"exploring,"
11410.85,"in a regimented way,"
time-restricted,feeding
11413.1,during pregnancy.
11414.34,"So please, please, please,"
if,"you're pregnant,"
11416.52,do not jump on a
time-restricted,"feeding,"
11418.38,so-called intermittent
fasting,diet.
11419.88,Talk to your OB/GYN.
11422.07,Talk to your doctor.
11423.72,Talk to multiple
"doctors,","for that matter,"
11425.79,before doing anything like
"that,","because, of course,"
11428.01,"you're now eating for two, or"
if,"you have twins in there,"
11430.41,you're eating for three.
11432.15,Very important.
11433.08,"If, however, you're"
not,yet pregnant
11434.58,"and you want to be fertile, get"
"pregnant,",or simply maintain
11439.02,a fertile potential
and,biology and you're
11442.77,following intermittent
"fasting,",it's
11444.78,going to be the regularity of
those,periods and regularity
11447.748,of cycle length that will
tell,you whether or not
11449.79,that's a good idea or not.
11451.35,"Keeping in mind, of course,"
that,if your total number
11454.68,"of calories is too low,"
your,periods will cease.
11457.8,That's a well-known effect.
11459.67,"But of course, stress"
can,also induce
11462.78,cessation of menstruation.
11465.42,And there are other factors
that,can induce cessation
11467.76,of menstruation as well.
11469.15,Some of them start with changes
in,"the brain, literally,"
11472.417,in the hypothalamus.
11473.25,Some occur in the pituitary.
11474.93,Many lifestyle
factors,can do that.
11477.39,"But most typically,"
it's,going to be
11479.19,excessive caloric
restriction,or it's
11481.71,going to be a caloric
deficit,brought on
11484.32,by excess physical activity.
11486.52,So even if someone's
eating,"a lot,"
11488.28,if they're not eating enough to
offset,their physical activity
11492.06,or they're not eating
enough,"of, in particular,"
11494.22,"fats, the essential"
fatty,"acids and protein,"
11497.49,"but also carbohydrates, well,"
then,menstruation can cease.
11500.24,"And of course, if"
menstruation,"is ceasing,"
11501.99,"chances are, almost"
with,"certainty,"
11504.15,that you're not getting
regular,ovulations.
11506.32,"Now, in terms of males"
and,whether or not
11508.243,intermittent fasting
is,going to disrupt
11509.91,spermatogenesis and
testosterone,"production,"
11513.66,there's essentially no
data,we can look to.
11516.49,But we can look to
the,general logic
11518.1,around the relationship
between,"body fat, testosterone,"
11522.42,and spermatogenesis.
11523.53,And this was something
that,was covered
11525.21,in a discussion I had on
optimization,of hormone
11528.95,health for males that I
had,"with Dr. Kyle Gillette,"
11531.35,who's a medical doctor
and,obesity specialist.
11533.72,"Again, you find that"
episode,at hubermanlab.com
11536.03,if you want to learn all about
hormone,optimization in males.
11539.0,"And essentially, the"
story,is as follows.
11541.62,If a male is
excessively,"overweight,"
11544.77,he's carrying too much body
fat,"in particular, not too"
11547.37,much muscle--
11547.912,although that can
be,"an issue too,"
11549.328,but too much body fat
is,typically the issue--
11551.45,"so more than, say,"
20%,body fat--
11555.53,"well, then losing"
body,fat is going
11558.02,to be the primary goal for
maximizing,"testosterone, sperm"
11561.29,"health, and spermatogenesis."
11563.69,"If, however, a male is already"
"lean,","well, then actually"
11567.92,increasing calories will
increase,testosterone.
11571.19,So it's a bit of a
complicated,"story,"
11573.587,although not so complicated that
none,of us can understand it.
11576.17,"Basically, if you're"
"overweight,",you
11578.03,should focus on losing weight in
order,to maximize sperm quality
11580.94,and health.
11581.51,"If you are very lean, well,"
then,restricting your calories
11585.08,to the point where you are
starting,to lose weight
11587.96,or you're dropping
even,more body fat
11590.66,is unlikely to increase
your,testosterone further.
11593.75,It doesn't necessarily
mean,it's bad
11595.37,or that you shouldn't
try,"and go, for instance,"
11597.59,from 15% to 10% body fat.
11599.025,I'm not saying that
that's,bad and that
11600.65,will reduce your testosterone.
11602.0,"But in general,"
if,you're already
11603.38,very lean-- so 10%
body,"fat, 5% body"
11606.408,fat-- and you start
restricting,"calories further,"
11608.45,your testosterone
levels,will drop.
11610.71,So in the context of
intermittent,"fasting,"
11612.76,it's really not an
issue,of whether or not
11614.51,your feeding window is
8,hours or 12 hours.
11616.64,It's really an issue
of,whether or not
11618.223,you're getting enough calories
to,offset the physical demands
11620.9,and activities of your
"life,",whether or not
11623.03,you're on a maintenance diet
to,maintain your weight.
11625.28,"And of course, you have to"
put,all that in the context of
11627.23,whether or not you're overweight
or,lean to begin with.
11629.54,The simple thing to
take,away from this
11631.25,"is, if you're a"
male,who's using--
11633.14,because you like it--
intermittent,"fasting,"
11635.12,so-called
time-restricted,"feeding,"
11636.56,and you're following an
eight,hour or maybe even
11639.523,a one meal per day
type,approach--
11640.94,although I don't
really,recommend
11642.11,that for a number of reasons
we,could talk about separately.
11644.61,If you're eating over the course
of,8 or 10 or 12 hours per day
11647.96,because that's what works
for,you and you are ingesting
11650.9,enough calories to maintain
your,weight if you're already
11653.42,lean or you are
ingesting,fewer calories
11658.51,than you are burning in order
to,lose weight because you are
11661.01,already overweight and
you,"want to lose body fat,"
11664.295,you're probably optimizing
for,all the things
11666.17,that you need to do in order
to,improve sperm quality
11668.93,and testosterone levels.
11670.31,"Now, also in that"
episode,that I did
11672.02,with Dr. Kyle Gillette on
optimizing,"hormones for males,"
11675.08,we talked about testosterone
replacement,therapy.
11677.42,It's not a topic I want to get
into,in any detail right now.
11680.19,But I will say this.
11681.74,Remember earlier when we were
talking,about spermatogenesis
11684.38,and the fact that in order
for,sperm to be generated
11686.87,consistently every month
ongoing,from the time of puberty
11690.83,until essentially the
time,"that a man dies,"
11694.04,you need two things.
11695.25,You need testosterone
production,from the Leydig cells
11697.64,"of the testes, and you"
need,spermatogenesis
11701.42,to be supported by that
androgen-binding,protein
11704.54,coming from the support
"cells,",from the Sertoli cells.
11707.42,So you need
"testosterone,",and you
11708.8,"need androgen-binding protein,"
and,you need the Leydig cells
11711.38,and the Sertoli cells active.
11713.27,"When men take exogenous,"
meaning,"from outside the body,"
11716.39,"testosterone, either by cream or"
by,patch or by pellets or more
11719.51,typically by injection--
the,most typical TRT
11722.03,approach nowadays is
testosterone,"cypionate, which"
11724.19,is biologically identical
to,the kind of testosterone
11728.0,you would make.
11728.69,"Well, because of negative"
feedback,"loops, which you also"
11731.12,learned about
"earlier,",the testicles
11733.82,themselves shut down their
own,testosterone production.
11737.69,Why would that be?
11738.44,"OK, so you're taking"
testosterone,in by syringe
11741.14,or by patch or any other method.
11743.88,So the circulating testosterone
and,the amount that
11746.18,arrives at the testicle
is,going to be hopefully
11749.69,"clinically appropriate,"
not,"super physiological,"
11751.76,but it'll be somewhere in
the,"healthy reference range,"
11754.01,maybe a little bit higher.
11755.203,"Nowadays, some people are"
going,a little bit higher.
11757.37,So we're not talking about
full,"blown, quote, unquote,"
11759.23,"""anabolic steroid"
"use,""","keeping in mind,"
11761.28,"of course, that"
estrogen,is a steroid.
11762.947,Testosterone is a steroid.
11764.03,But when we think
about,"steroids,"
11764.96,we mean like
performance-enhancing,"drugs, so"
11766.793,super physiological doses.
11768.65,We're talking about
within,physiological
11770.75,or near physiological ranges.
11772.62,So if someone's taking
their,testosterone
11774.38,"in from an outside,"
"exogenous,","source,"
11778.13,the levels of
circulating,testosterone
11779.87,will be sufficiently
high,that the pituitary
11782.15,will register that and will
stop,making luteinizing hormone
11786.32,and generally
follicle-stimulating,"hormone,"
11788.48,as well.
11789.08,"And as a consequence,"
spermatogenesis,
11791.72,is vastly reduced or eliminated.
11794.48,"In other words, for men"
who,are on TRT or who
11798.32,are taking testosterone
from,"an external source,"
11801.95,the number of sperm that
they're,going to make
11803.9,is going to be
dramatically,reduced.
11805.53,There are things that they
can,"do to offset that,"
11807.572,"like taking hCG, human chorionic"
"gonadotropin,",which is just
11810.5,kind of a mimic for
luteinizing,hormone
11812.18,to stimulate the testes to
continue,to make testosterone.
11816.23,And some men will also--
11818.45,or instead-- take FSH to
stimulate,the Sertoli cells
11822.8,to support spermatogenesis--
excuse,me--
11826.73,or both or some combination.
11828.33,Some people take
"clomiphene,",Clomid.
11830.09,There are any number
of,different ways
11831.673,to bypass or offset the
sperm-reducing,effects
11835.58,of taking exogenous
testosterone.,
11837.6,This is a conversation
that,was covered
11839.33,in a fair amount of detail in
that,episode with Dr. Gillette.
11841.91,But just keep in mind that if
you,are taking testosterone
11845.63,"from an exogenous source, your"
sperm,counts will dramatically
11849.568,"be reduced, unless you do"
something,to offset it.
11851.61,So if you are
wishing,"to conceive,"
11853.137,you need to think
about,whether or not
11854.72,you're going to offset the
testosterone,replacement
11857.18,therapy or whether or not you're
going,to come off it entirely.
11860.61,So you'll need to talk to
a,urologist endocrinologist
11863.0,about that.
11864.65,"And again, a number of these"
different,themes and ways
11867.08,to go about tapering
off,TRT were
11868.82,covered in that episode
with,Dr. Kyle Gillette.
11871.04,So if you're on TRT or
you're,considering taking it
11873.38,and you're interested
in,"having children,"
11875.088,not just now but at
any,"point, you really"
11876.875,want to take these things
into,consideration.
11878.75,"Now, I do want to point out"
"that,",for the number of you
11881.63,out there who are taking
"supplements,",some of which
11884.39,we've talked about
on,this podcast
11885.86,and I've talked about in other
"podcasts,",such as tongkat ali--
11888.27,it turns out that there
are,a lot of men and women
11890.353,taking tongkat ali to reduce
sex,hormone binding globulin
11893.24,"levels, to increase testosterone"
and,"estrogen, in some cases,"
11896.0,libido and so forth.
11898.19,"Those approaches, meaning"
supplement-based,"approaches,"
11900.98,to increase testosterone
or,free testosterone
11905.54,or some related
"hormones,",are not
11908.36,going to shut down your
own,endogenous testosterone
11911.0,production and reduce the
number,of sperm that you make
11913.94,"or, at least as far as we"
"know,",disrupt ovulation
11916.835,"in any kind of way,"
provided,that the dosages
11918.71,are within normal ranges.
11919.76,"Again, supplementation"
to,support your hormones
11922.97,should not disrupt
ovulation,or spermatogenesis
11927.47,or testosterone production.
11928.76,Quite the opposite.
11929.76,It should enhance it.
11930.74,What I just described
around,TRT as taking
11932.93,"exogenous testosterone,"
that,itself
11935.39,is an entirely different beast.
11937.07,"Now, with all of"
that,"said, there"
11938.84,are some supplements
out,there that
11942.08,include testosterone
as,a ingredient that's
11945.5,been snuck in to various
formulas,that include
11949.308,blends and things of that sort.
11950.6,You want to be aware of that.
11951.808,And we did an episode about
how,to develop a rational guide
11954.77,to supplementation.
11956.1,I highly recommend
listening,to that episode.
11958.095,"Again, it's timestamped,"
available,free
11959.72,at hubermanlab.com
in,all formats.
11962.03,Because it talks about
which,supplements
11964.52,are likely to be
"clean,","quote, unquote,"
11966.32,to contain the things that
you,"expect them to contain,"
11968.42,there's more and more
evidence,coming out that
11970.337,"a lot of supplements,"
including,some--
11971.96,"for instance,"
supplements,that contain
11974.51,testicle or the
extracts,of testicles
11976.85,can contain testosterone.
11978.242,Whether or not they can shut
down,your own endogenous
11980.45,testosterone
production,isn't clear.
11982.293,No one's really
explored,that in detail.
11983.96,But based on everything we
just,"talked about with TRT,"
11985.97,it stands to reason that it
might,either reduce it or shut
11988.56,it down.
11989.06,It's just never
been,explored yet.
11990.87,"So by all means, make sure"
that,what you're taking
11993.672,if you're taking supplements.
11994.88,"But again, the"
major,point here is
11997.25,"that, for both"
females,"and males,"
11998.66,taking supplements to
support,healthy hormone
12001.24,"production, including"
things,"like tongkat ali,"
12004.63,is not the same as taking
hormones,or bioidentical
12008.44,"hormones, which indeed can"
shut,down your own endogenous
12012.01,production of
hormones,and thereby
12013.57,reduce both egg quality and
the,chance of fertilization
12017.23,and healthy pregnancy
and,sperm quality
12019.06,and the chance of fertilization
and,healthy pregnancy.
12021.37,Any time there's a discussion
about,"fertility and pregnancy,"
12025.54,there seems to also be
a,parallel discussion
12027.7,about sex determination.
12029.47,"That is, what factors can"
influence,whether or not
12032.83,the child that's born
is,male or female.
12035.41,"That is, whether or not it has"
double,X chromosomes-- so one X
12038.53,"chromosome from mom, one"
X,chromosome from dad
12040.72,because the egg was
fertilized,by a sperm that
12042.91,"had an X sex chromosome,"
that,23rd chromosome--
12046.15,or whether or not the offspring
is,"male, whether or not"
12048.91,it has the X chromosome from
"mom,",because it's always going
12051.368,to be the X chromosome
in,"that egg,"
12053.83,and a Y chromosome
from,the sperm that
12056.14,fertilized that particular egg.
12057.815,"Now, of course, there"
are,instances out
12059.44,there of people that have XXY
chromosomes,or XYY chromosomes.
12064.87,But the vast majority
of,people out there
12067.9,are going to have either
an,XX chromosome-- so we
12072.04,call that a female karyotype.
12074.74,This is different than
genotype,"and phenotype,"
12076.99,but a female karyotype
would,be XX--
12080.23,"or a male karyotype,"
which,would be XY.
12084.76,"Now, despite the fact that"
it,is the egg and the sperm
12087.31,and the chromosomes
that,they carry
12088.768,that are going to
determine,"the chromosomes,"
12091.01,there's a lot of lore and
discussion,about the factors
12094.27,that can bias which sperm
will,fertilize the egg
12098.14,and thereby whether
or,not you're
12099.67,"going to get an XX, female,"
or,"an XY, male, chromosome"
12103.27,and therefore offspring.
12104.63,"Now, not only is the lore"
around,this whole issue of sex
12107.68,"determination rather prominent,"
but,it is also somewhat unusual
12112.33,and perhaps even interesting.
12113.86,"So for instance,"
Aristotle,himself proposed
12117.58,that if a man is thinking about
himself,and his own pleasure
12122.44,more than his partner
and,her pleasure
12126.25,at the point of
"ejaculation,",then
12129.46,the offspring will be male.
12131.11,Aristotle also asserted
that,if a man is thinking
12133.51,more about his partner
and,her pleasure
12135.76,at the point in which he
"ejaculates,","well, then"
12138.85,the offspring would be female.
12140.83,"And of course, we"
have,zero reason
12143.17,to believe that there's any
truth,to Aristotle's theory.
12146.11,There are no data
to,support that.
12147.693,"In fact, I'm not"
even,sure how you
12149.11,would run that experiment
because,you can't really
12151.81,look at people's thoughts.
12153.31,You'd have to rely on
honest,self-report.
12156.31,And even if people were
to,faithfully report
12159.43,what they were thinking about
at,"the moment of ejaculation,"
12162.35,"this would involve, of"
"course,",bringing people
12164.267,into the laboratory and
somehow,measuring or analyzing
12167.22,their thoughts or
gathering,their thoughts
12168.97,during the sexual intercourse
at,"the point of ejaculation,"
12172.15,then figuring out which
biological,sex was
12175.0,"the offspring, et cetera."
12176.59,Just near impossible and
probably,not the most important
12179.71,experiment to invest
our,time doing.
12181.9,"Nonetheless, there"
continues,to be
12185.26,a lot of lore about
what,determines
12187.668,the sex of the offspring.
12188.71,"Most notably, there's a"
lot,of lore and discussion
12191.17,and rumor about the idea that
particular,sexual positions
12195.31,at the point of ejaculation
during,intercourse
12198.04,can somehow bias the likelihood
that,a pregnancy will
12202.03,be either resulting in
male,or female offspring.
12206.43,"Now, again, there are"
zero,"data to support this,"
12208.79,and yet this whole notion
of,sex determination
12211.88,is a really interesting
one,that people
12213.56,seem to be somewhat obsessed
"by,","so much so that, again,"
12217.31,if you go online or
if,you were to talk
12219.08,to people in the sort of
let's,call it holistic
12222.17,or peripheral health spaces
related,"to fertility,"
12226.26,there is discussion
"about,","OK, well,"
12227.96,you take this sexual position
at,the point of ejaculation
12230.42,to get a boy and you
take,that sexual position
12232.337,at the point of
ejaculation,to get a girl
12234.05,or you do this in the
early,part of the day
12236.75,or the later part of the day.
12238.38,"Again, all for"
which,there is zero
12240.71,data to support any kind
of,systematic relationship
12244.34,between what I just discussed
and,the biological sex
12246.53,of the offspring.
12247.37,"That said, there are"
now,emerging methods
12251.21,that people are using in order
to,separate out the sperm that
12257.0,will indeed give rise
to,a male offspring
12260.36,versus a female offspring.
12261.87,"Now, this, of course,"
is,done in the context
12263.72,of in-vitro fertilization.
12265.437,We haven't talked too much
about,in-vitro fertilization.
12267.77,But in-vitro
fertilization,"involves,"
12269.84,"as the name suggests, taking"
an,"egg and taking a sperm,"
12273.8,pairing them in a dish.
12275.18,This can be done a
number,of different ways.
12277.88,But just to briefly
describe,"the IVF procedure,"
12280.91,IVF involves
administering,supra--
12284.62,meaning greater than normal--
supraphysiological,levels
12288.32,of follicle-stimulating
hormone,and luteinizing hormone
12291.89,during the follicular
phase,of a woman's cycle.
12294.44,What that causes is the
maturation,of not just one
12298.31,egg that would be ovulated but
multiple,follicles and eggs.
12303.63,And then ovulation
itself,is suppressed also
12307.25,through the administration
of,exogenous hormones.
12310.04,"And then, under"
ultrasound,"guidance,"
12312.59,an OB/GYN goes in and collects
the,"mature eggs and follicles,"
12316.43,puts them in a
"dish,",and then sperm
12318.337,"are delivered to that dish,"
and,those could either
12320.42,be sperm that were
frozen,"previously,"
12322.7,"or more typically or ideally,"
it,would be live sperm collected
12326.21,that day that are
washed,through a very
12329.27,straightforward procedure.
12331.04,And then those sperm
either,are allowed
12333.23,to compete for those eggs
and,fertilize those eggs
12335.87,and allow them to advance
to,very early embryo stage
12339.71,before those embryos are
frozen,and eventually implanted
12342.2,into a woman in order to have
them,"be carried to full term,"
12346.5,ideally.
12347.18,Or there's a procedure in which
specific,sperm are selected
12351.26,because they have the
best,"morphology, motility,"
12353.45,and so forth.
12354.26,And in a process
called,"ICSI, I-C-S-I,"
12357.68,in which the sperm themselves
are,literally forced
12361.79,to fertilize that
particular,egg.
12364.02,"Now, under those conditions,"
typically,"a couple or a woman,"
12370.957,if she's doing this on her
own,"with a sperm donor,"
12373.04,will get multiple
fertilized,embryos
12376.61,that are carried to
a,multicellular stage
12380.18,so that it's clear that
they,could grow into a child
12383.45,if they were implanted
into,a viable host--
12386.507,"sometimes the surrogate,"
sometimes,the woman
12388.34,who wants the child herself.
12390.17,And under those
"conditions,",it is
12391.88,possible to look at
the,"genetic makeup,"
12393.77,"including the karyotype,"
of,those early nascent
12397.04,"embryos, in which case"
people,really can select
12400.31,the sex of their offspring.
12401.48,"That is, they will have"
some,embryos that are
12405.26,"XX, some embryos that are XY."
12407.51,"It's very likely,"
"also,",that they
12409.01,will have some embryos that have
karyotypes,or genotypes which
12413.24,are not ideal in that
they,would potentially
12416.33,lead to a miscarriage or
some,other genetic defect.
12418.58,"And so, typically,"
people,do not select
12421.4,to implant those embryos
if,they have the option
12425.12,to implant embryos that are
of,either XX or XY karyotype
12430.49,and the normal
chromosomal,arrangements
12433.67,for obvious reasons.
12436.07,So the whole point here is
that,"sex selection is possible,"
12440.03,but only using
in-vitro,fertilization.
12443.18,The other thing that
is,becoming clear to us
12445.7,in more recent years is that
sex,selection is actually
12449.3,possible at the level
of,the sperm even prior
12451.97,to fertilization.
12453.21,This is an emerging data
"set,",and this is largely
12456.47,happening in clinics outside
of,the United States.
12458.69,But there are some clinics
that,have figured out methods
12461.12,in which they can
take,a sperm sample
12463.19,and they can spin that
sperm,sample in a centrifuge
12466.7,at a rate that separates
out,the sperm into what
12469.4,are called different fractions.
12470.85,So for those of you who've
done,a little bit of biology
12472.4,"with centrifuge, it's when"
you,spin any kind of substance
12475.31,that includes multiple things
in,it of different weights.
12478.165,"When you spin them, the"
things,of different weights
12480.29,segregate out into
different,fractions
12482.423,along the depth of the tube.
12483.59,And then you can take out
one,fraction or the next
12485.81,simply with a little pipette.
12486.86,You take out the top
"fraction,","the middle fraction,"
12488.985,and so forth.
12489.6,And what these clinics
have,figured out
12491.24,is that if they spin the sperm
sample,at the correct spin rate
12496.07,that the sperm
that,will give rise
12499.1,to male offspring and the
sperm,that will give rise
12502.67,to female offspring segregate
out,"into different fractions,"
12505.73,allowing them to take each
of,those fractions separately
12509.69,"and to apply them to eggs, if"
it's,"in-vitro fertilization,"
12513.71,"and give rise very reliably,"
certainly,much more
12517.13,"than chance, to either"
male,or female embryos.
12521.39,"They also, of course,"
can,choose to do
12523.76,this outside the context
of,in-vitro fertilization.
12526.2,So some people are now opting
to,have their sperm samples spun
12529.67,"out in this way, separate"
out,the sperm that give rise
12532.85,to male or female
"offspring,",and then
12534.59,to only use the fraction
that,they are interested in--
12538.59,"so if they want a boy,"
they'll,use one fraction.
12540.59,"If they want a girl, they'll"
use,different fraction--
12543.02,and then to use those fractions
in,the context of what's
12546.65,"called IUI, or intrauterine"
"insemination,",which
12549.98,"is, as the name suggests, rather"
than,having the man deliver
12554.0,the ejaculate with his penis
and,"the sperm with his penis,"
12556.46,they have a device.
12557.99,The devices are now
commercially,sold.
12559.89,"Believe it or not, they're"
sold,over-the-counter
12561.89,"and on the internet, so people"
will,even do this at home.
12564.21,And so what they're doing
is,"they'll take the sperm,"
12566.377,and they'll do IUI in order
to,bias the probability
12571.1,that they're going to get a
male,or a female offspring.
12573.62,"Again, this is something"
that's,now emerging.
12576.32,It's not commonplace.
12577.91,"Most of the time, people simply"
roll,"the dice, as it were,"
12582.26,by having either intercourse
and,just hoping for or not
12586.43,caring if they get a male
or,a female offspring
12589.01,"or, in the instance"
of,"IVF, selecting"
12591.05,"male or female offspring,"
sometimes,largely
12593.18,on the basis of the
chromosomal,arrangements.
12595.1,"So of course, some"
people,might prefer
12598.79,to have one or the
other,biological sex
12601.1,as their offspring.
12602.07,"But of course, the healthy"
chromosomal,arrangements
12605.18,are going to be paramount
for,getting a healthy child.
12608.03,"And as I mentioned before,"
unhealthy,chromosomal
12611.24,arrangements or abnormal
chromosomal,arrangements
12613.34,often lead to miscarriage
and/or,birth defects.
12616.53,So selecting for healthy
chromosomal,arrangements
12619.55,"is always paramount,"
but,some people
12621.29,are selecting for
biological,sex.
12622.88,"And indeed, some couples"
who,can conceive naturally
12627.41,are opting for
IUI,in order to be
12630.86,able to select biological
sex,because of this ability
12633.74,to spin out the sperm samples
to,different fractions
12637.04,and select the male
or,female sperm.
12639.98,"That is, the sperm"
that,would give rise
12641.63,to a male or female offspring.
12643.02,So this is a rapidly emerging
"theme,",believe it or not.
12646.98,Who knew?
12648.17,"And of course, it has nothing to"
do,with Aristotle's assertions
12650.87,about what people are
thinking,about at the point
12652.912,"of ejaculation, nor"
does,it have anything
12654.86,to do with body position at
the,point of ejaculation.
12657.86,But I do find it
rather,interesting
12659.51,"that, even in this"
day,"and age, people"
12662.21,seem to be continually
pursuing,new and different ways
12665.87,to understand why one
sperm,or another sperm
12668.57,happens to fertilize the egg.
12671.55,And when that information
is,"not available,"
12673.99,"because, frankly, it's"
not,available yet--
12675.74,we don't know why
a,sperm containing
12677.96,a Y chromosome or a sperm
containing,an X chromosome
12680.42,is more likely to
fertilize,an egg.
12682.005,And there are some
"ideas,","for instance,"
12683.63,that older fathers tend to
have,more daughters as opposed
12686.15,to sons.
12686.767,But when you really look at
the,"data, it's pretty mixed."
12689.1,So if you've heard
that,"before, it"
12691.607,has a particular nickname
that,I'm not going
12693.44,to describe on the podcast.
12694.637,You can look it up online.
12695.72,But if any of you are aware
of,any other kind of ideals
12699.8,"or lore, no matter how"
ridiculous,"or crazy, please"
12702.328,put them in the comment
section,on YouTube.
12704.12,I'd be very curious to learn
about,"those, mostly out"
12707.09,of interest and curiosity.
12709.43,"But, look, sometimes"
these,"outrageous stories,"
12712.34,such as notions of body
position,and how they influence
12715.905,"biological sex, even though"
they,"turn out not to be true,"
12718.28,turn out to be interesting
for,other reasons.
12720.327,"And in fact, next,"
we're,going to talk
12721.91,about how body position
during,sexual intercourse
12724.55,"can, in fact, influence"
fertility,and pregnancy.
12728.64,So another common theme
around,fertility and pregnancy
12731.18,that you'll hear about
is,"that, for couples"
12733.31,"that are trying to get pregnant,"
that,during intercourse they
12737.21,should do whatever it
is,"that works for them,"
12739.64,but then after
the,man ejaculates
12743.18,that the woman should
try,and position
12745.31,her ankles above her head
or,somehow otherwise tilt
12750.23,her pelvis back in order
to,increase the rate and/or
12754.19,probability that the
sperm,"swim toward the egg,"
12757.59,as opposed to the
other,direction.
12759.38,"Now, I talked to a couple"
of,different OB/GYNs
12762.47,and urologists that are focused
on,"fertility about this topic,"
12766.67,and it turns out you get
pretty,mixed answers as to
12769.04,whether or not there's
any,validity to this idea
12771.38,that the woman's body position
after,the man ejaculates
12774.83,inside of her can
somehow,influence
12777.38,the probability of pregnancy.
12778.85,One group of experts
told,me that there
12781.16,is no reason for a woman
to,need to continue
12783.56,"to lie down, elevate the"
"ankles,",or in any way
12787.04,tilt her pelvis back
in,order to increase
12789.65,the probability of
successful,fertilization.
12792.83,The other group suggested that
indeed,there is a strong reason
12797.12,to believe that tilting the
pelvis,"back, maybe even keeping"
12801.11,"the ankles elevated,"
and,having a woman lie
12803.94,on her back for about 15 minutes
with,the pelvis positioned
12807.99,at about 20 degrees back
is,ideal for optimizing
12813.21,fertilization.
12813.815,"I mean, they were"
really,specific
12815.19,about the recommendations.
12816.273,"So I find this interesting that,"
within,the cohort of extremely
12820.89,"well trained MDs, OB/GYNs"
and,"urology fertility docs,"
12825.51,"and OB/GYNs, you see a split."
12827.58,It has nothing to do
with,whether or not
12829.29,the physician was male or
female,or their training
12832.92,"or their institution,"
none,of that.
12834.59,There just seemed to be a sort
of,even split between the two.
12836.74,"Now, granted, it wasn't"
the,largest sample size
12838.5,that I could have obtained.
12839.625,And yet I do find it
interesting,that there's
12842.09,this split in the
opinion,about this.
12845.04,"One group, the group that said,"
"no,",pelvic position doesn't
12848.94,"really matter, don't"
worry,"about it,"
12851.62,it's not going to influence
the,"rates of fertilization,"
12854.46,argued that the sperm
swim,very quickly
12857.595,and that if they are
released,near the cervix
12859.47,they're going to swim very
quickly,toward the egg
12862.08,in order to fertilize it
regardless,of pelvic position.
12865.86,"The other group said, well,"
"yes,",sperm swim quickly
12870.09,and even if they're
released,right at the entry
12872.91,to the cervix that the sperm
still,have a long distance
12876.58,to go.
12877.08,"Again, if you were to"
scale,this according
12879.36,to the size of the sperm versus
the,"size of a human body,"
12882.57,"an entire human body,"
what,you'd scale it to
12885.09,is the distance between Los
Angeles,and San Francisco.
12887.34,And it needs to undergo that
basically,within 24 hours
12889.77,or so.
12890.04,"Although, as we"
mentioned,"earlier,"
12891.457,sperm can survive
quite,a while inside
12894.09,of the woman's body-- maybe
three,or five days at least.
12897.85,So in both cases
they,acknowledge
12899.245,it's a long distance.
12900.12,"But on the one hand,"
you,have a group
12901.83,of experts that are saying the
sperm,more or less know what
12904.315,to do and are going
to,do it regardless
12905.94,of the position of the woman
after,ejaculation inside her
12909.06,and the other group
"saying,","no, we"
12911.06,want to do everything
we,can to bias
12912.6,the likelihood that the
sperm,will fertilize the egg.
12916.17,"Well, setting aside"
the,basic argument
12919.92,that tilting back at the pelvis
and,lying stationary or so
12925.02,for about 15 minutes
after,sexual intercourse
12928.35,and ejaculation is not
an,"expensive endeavor,"
12933.69,although it requires
a,little bit of time.
12936.21,And it forces people to
remain,motionless or close
12939.42,"to motionless, and they're not"
up,and around and moving about.
12942.69,"Aside from that, it's a"
relatively,low investment.
12945.4,"So one argument is,"
"well,",if it could
12947.43,bias the likelihood of
fertilization,at all
12950.82,"and people want to get pregnant,"
why,wouldn't they do that?
12954.807,So that's a reasonable argument.
12956.14,But it doesn't really
point,to the mechanism.
12958.41,The arguments that point to a
potential,mechanism are that--
12961.518,if you recall what we were
talking,about when we talked
12963.81,"about sperm quality,"
sperm,quality
12966.055,involves a bunch of
different,"measures,"
12967.68,like concentration of sperm
per,"milliliter of semen,"
12971.25,"morphology of those sperm,"
how,many are forward motile.
12974.61,It turns out that in any
one,"ejaculate sample,"
12977.88,the total number of forward
motile,and yet fast forward
12982.71,motile sperm that are also of
the,highest quality morphology
12988.59,is actually quite low.
12990.37,And so the idea here
is,that you want
12993.0,to get as many sperm
of,the highest quality
12995.73,swimming toward the egg because
those,sperm stand the highest
12999.03,probability of
fertilizing,that egg.
13000.682,"And in fact, this relates to"
some,of the discussion we were
13003.14,having earlier about behavioral
dos,and don'ts for sake
13006.89,of increasing the
probability,of fertilization.
13010.4,And the one that is most
important,here is cannabis.
13013.91,It turns out that
the,data on cannabis
13015.74,really do support the
idea,that some of you
13018.5,may have heard from
parents,and teachers--
13020.93,"I don't know, I did hear this"
from,parents and teachers--
13023.72,that cannabis can disrupt
the,swimming styles of sperm
13028.7,in ways that are not
supportive,"of fertilization,"
13031.82,that it can turn more of
the,sperm into twitchers.
13034.1,Although when I
learned,"about this,"
13035.21,I was not informed of
the,"word ""twitchers."""
13037.002,"What I was told is that,"
if,"you use cannabis,"
13040.1,that the sperm don't know
which,"direction to go,"
13042.44,"that they're confused,"
almost,implying
13045.2,that the sperm themselves
are,high on cannabis.
13047.87,"Well, that's certainly not the"
argument,that I'm making here.
13051.35,But it does seem to be
the,case that people
13054.26,"who use cannabis, even once,"
the,sperm that are generated
13058.63,during that particular month
or,two months during which
13063.7,or after which they
use,cannabis have
13066.19,less forward motility and
possibly,"altered morphology,"
13070.87,as well.
13071.56,I want to be very
"clear,",I did not
13073.12,say that if you use cannabis
once,you are forever
13075.79,disrupting the motility and
morphology,of your sperm.
13079.36,I did not say that.
13080.17,What I said is that if
you,"use cannabis once,"
13082.75,then the sperm that are
generated,in the 60 days
13085.96,after that cannabis
use,are going
13089.13,to have a higher incidence of
disrupted,motility and perhaps
13092.83,morphology as well.
13094.84,"Remember, sperm are continually"
generated,every 60 days or so.
13099.9,And so if you use cannabis
"once,",you are not forever
13103.26,disrupting your sperm.
13104.28,But if you are using
cannabis,and then you
13106.53,are looking to conceive
in,"the next 60 days,"
13108.87,"you are going to be reducing,"
we,"think significantly so,"
13112.95,the number of quality
forwardly,motile sperm.
13116.74,So the simple takeaway from
this,is avoid cannabis use.
13119.52,Although if you are going
to,"use cannabis-- and again,"
13121.95,there are medical
uses,of cannabis
13124.17,and beneficial uses of cannabis
for,certain populations.
13126.6,It can be bad for
other,populations.
13128.41,We talked about that in
the,Huberman Lab podcast
13130.53,all about cannabis.
13131.46,But if you're going
to,"use cannabis,"
13133.11,you should try and abstain
from,cannabis in the two months
13136.77,prior to the attempt to
fertilize,and get pregnant.
13140.97,"Now, I'm not aware"
of,any data on how
13143.58,cannabis use by the woman
can,influence the likelihood
13147.0,of fertilization and pregnancy.
13148.59,And I want to couch this whole
discussion,around cannabis
13151.052,under the umbrella of something
that,came up in the episode
13153.51,"that I did on cannabis,"
which,"is that, for about half"
13156.93,"of people out there,"
male,and female--
13159.79,so here we're not distinguishing
by,biological sex.
13163.71,About half of people
that,use cannabis
13165.63,report it as an aphrodisiac.
13167.34,It makes them want to have
sexual,intercourse more than
13170.595,if they don't use cannabis.
13171.72,And for the other
"half,",it actually
13173.64,has the opposite effect by way
of,an influence on a hormone
13176.49,"called prolactin,"
which,suppresses
13178.5,"the dopamine system,"
the,"testosterone,"
13180.24,and the estrogenic system.
13182.29,And so this whole idea that
cannabis,is an aphrodisiac
13185.19,seems to be true for about half
of,the human population and not
13188.25,for the other half of
the,human population.
13190.06,So I mention that because
I,know a number of people
13192.66,use cannabis as an aphrodisiac.
13195.72,They like to use cannabis
before,intercourse.
13197.61,It was actually very
surprising,to me
13200.07,to discover when I
researched,that cannabis
13202.2,episode that approximately
15%,of women who are pregnant
13207.66,continue to use cannabis
during,pregnancy.
13210.51,And that's a very
alarming,statistic.
13212.7,And everything we know is
that,the use of cannabis
13216.33,during pregnancy is detrimental
to,the health and particularly
13219.6,the brain development
of,the fetus.
13221.35,So that's a real concern.
13223.17,I highly recommend women
abstain,from cannabis use
13225.93,during pregnancy.
13227.49,Talk to your OB/GYN about
it,if you're using it all
13230.25,or considering using at all.
13231.63,So based on what I told
you,earlier about the fact
13233.79,that cannabis use is not good
for,egg quality and the fact
13238.23,that cannabis use can
disrupt,the motility of sperm
13240.93,and therefore is not
good,for sperm quality
13244.17,and it can disrupt the patterns
of,swimming in sperm in ways
13247.74,that reduce the
likelihood,"of fertility,"
13249.942,I think the take-home message
is,"clear, which is that"
13252.15,whether or not you want
to,be a cannabis user
13255.03,"or not, if you are going"
to,try and conceive
13257.22,and certainly while
you're,"pregnant,"
13258.72,you're going to want to
avoid,the use of cannabis.
13260.97,And that is smoked cannabis
and,vaped cannabis.
13263.97,"And during pregnancy,"
the,consumption
13267.39,of cannabis even in edible
form,or in tincture form
13270.06,is also going to be detrimental
to,the developing fetus.
13272.88,"But of course, we"
started,this conversation
13275.07,in the context of body
"position,",in particular
13278.1,at the point of
"ejaculation,",in determining
13280.2,the sex of the offspring and/or
the,likelihood of getting
13284.61,a successful fertilization
in,pregnancy.
13286.75,And I think that given that the
tilting,back of the pelvis--
13290.97,"so again, this is elevating the"
pelvis,by about 20 degrees--
13294.33,I don't think it has
to,"be exact, exact--"
13296.31,but about 20 degrees for about
15,minutes post-ejaculation
13300.12,inside of the
woman--,or I suppose
13302.4,"if people are using IUI,"
intrauterine,insemination.
13305.7,Since that seems to be the
consensus,among those experts
13308.76,that believe that
pelvic,tilt backward
13313.17,can be beneficial for
increasing,the probability
13315.99,of fertilization and
given,that it involves
13318.12,no cost but a little bit
of,"time seems to me that,"
13320.557,if you want to get
"pregnant,",that that
13322.14,would be the right thing to do.
13323.577,"And as far as I know,"
there's,no information
13325.41,nor was I able to obtain any
recommendations,from experts
13328.98,about what the ideal
body,position of the male
13331.77,is after ejaculation
if,the goal is
13334.32,to increase the probability
of,fertilization in pregnancy.
13337.45,So we've been talking about
behavioral,"interventions,"
13339.66,some dos and some don'ts that
people,can do to increase
13341.952,"their fertility, and the"
likelihood,that any fertilized
13345.15,egg will be carried
to,term successfully.
13347.67,And soon we'll also
talk,about things
13349.68,that people can take to
improve,their fertility.
13352.23,"Now, keep in mind that"
this,entire discussion
13354.36,is about fertility.
13355.8,"But also remember,"
as,we discussed
13358.05,at the beginning of
the,"episode, trying"
13360.72,to increase your fertility
is,one of the best ways
13364.2,to think about trying
to,create and maintain
13367.29,optimal physical health.
13369.392,So for people that
are,trying to conceive
13371.1,and for people who are
not,"trying to conceive,"
13373.23,optimizing your fertility
"status,",whether or not
13375.51,"you're male or female,"
is,one of the best ways
13378.03,to target those approaches.
13379.71,And there are now a lot of
data,supporting the idea
13382.44,that acupuncture
of,all things can
13384.96,be very beneficial for improving
both,female and male fertility
13388.74,"and, should a"
woman,"get pregnant,"
13390.93,for improving the quality
of,outcomes-- that
13393.57,"is, the likelihood"
that,there will
13395.46,be a successful pregnancy
that,"is carried to term,"
13399.6,"not premature, and"
so,on and so forth.
13402.312,"Now, for some of"
you,"out there, you"
13403.77,"might think, oh, of"
"course,","acupuncture,"
13405.27,acupuncture has been known to
work,for thousands of years.
13407.687,"And therefore,"
it's,not surprising
13410.25,that it would assist with
fertility,and pregnancy.
13413.31,For many of you
out,"there, however,"
13415.21,"probably thinking,"
"acupuncture,",that
13416.73,seems kind of like
fringe,science.
13418.53,But what I can assure
you,is that there are now
13421.05,quite a few clinical
trials,funded
13423.42,"by government agencies, like the"
National,"Institutes of Health,"
13426.72,showing that acupuncture is
a,very effective treatment
13429.45,for a number of
different,"things,"
13430.93,including fertility
and,"pregnancy,"
13432.66,"but for hormone status,"
for,"stress relief,"
13436.56,even for chronic illnesses
of,"different kinds,"
13439.18,including autoimmune illnesses.
13440.68,So this is no longer
considered,fringe science.
13443.02,"In fact, one of the"
best,laboratories
13445.05,in the world working
on,this is a laboratory
13447.21,out of Harvard Medical School
run,by a guy named Qiufu Fu.
13450.9,Qiufu's lab has really been
exploring,in a mechanistic way
13454.74,how the different
stimulation,sites that
13457.08,are used in acupuncture--
so,where the needles are
13459.21,inserted-- tap into
neural,pathways that
13461.85,link the different
organs,of the body.
13463.87,"So for instance, they've"
found,that stimulation
13466.83,of a particular site
on,the lower limb
13469.71,can reduce inflammation
dramatically,
13472.08,throughout the body by
way,of neural pathways
13475.17,that originate in the
lower,limb and extend
13477.66,to areas such as the
kidney,and the pancreas.
13479.95,"So all these, quote,"
"unquote,","""ancient maps"""
13482.79,of the human body as they
relate,to acupuncture
13484.95,are now being parsed at the
level,"of mechanism, which"
13487.53,I think is wonderful because
it,not only is showing us
13490.71,that so much of what has
been,purported and reported
13494.19,in the landscape of
acupuncture,actually
13496.74,has an underlying
mechanistic,"basis,"
13498.72,and with additional mechanistic
"understanding,","of course,"
13501.55,always arrive new
and,better practices.
13503.77,"That's the idea, to evolve"
these,"fields of acupuncture,"
13506.88,to evolve the fields of
mechanistic,understanding
13508.98,of our biology and health.
13510.61,And so the issue of whether
or,not acupuncture can assist
13514.59,in getting pregnant and in
carrying,a child to term
13518.49,and for that child to
be,healthy are really
13520.74,starting to emerge
in,a major way.
13523.32,And rather than go
into,all those data
13525.3,"in detail, what I can"
tell,you is that there are
13527.64,clinical trials and data
supporting,the fact that
13529.89,female fertility
itself,can be supported
13532.05,by acupuncture through several
"mechanisms,",one of which
13536.25,is the balancing-- and I realize
that's,"a somewhat tricky term,"
13539.335,and I'll define it
better,in a moment--
13540.96,the balancing of hormones across
the,"ovulatory/menstrual cycle,"
13546.13,including regulating
levels,of FSH
13548.19,so that they're not
too,high nor too low
13550.32,and restricting the
FSH,to the follicular
13553.23,"phase of the menstrual cycle,"
as,well as using acupuncture
13558.63,to improve things
like,blood flow
13560.79,and the health of
the,ovary itself
13562.62,and other aspects of the
female,reproductive axis.
13565.71,So acupuncture can operate at
the,"chemical level, impacting"
13569.68,hormones.
13570.18,It can act at the
mechanical,"level,"
13572.46,impacting the different tissues
through,which the egg has
13575.46,to pass and so on and so forth.
13577.05,"Likewise, on the male"
"side,",acupuncture
13579.63,has been shown to improve
semen,"volume, quality of sperm,"
13584.4,"sperm motility, et"
"cetera,",and in large part
13588.03,through changes in the
neural,pathways that
13590.76,innervate the very tissues and
vascular,input to the scrotum
13595.92,"and testicles, because,"
as,"we learned earlier,"
13598.77,temperature regulation of
the,scrotum and testicles
13600.9,is so vital for
getting,healthy sperm
13603.51,and increasing sperm quality.
13605.41,"In addition, there are good"
data,to support the idea
13608.34,that acupuncture can increase
levels,"of testosterone,"
13611.708,"free testosterone, and"
the,sorts of hormones that
13613.75,are going to support healthy
hormone,production and sperm
13617.2,production in males.
13619.18,And this is distinct from
applying,testosterone
13623.29,from an exogenous source.
13624.61,So when we're talking about
acupuncture,and increasing
13626.86,"levels of testosterone, we're"
talking,about increasing levels
13629.402,of endogenous testosterone.
13631.03,So those Leydig cells can
support,"the Sertoli cells,"
13633.7,and the Sertoli cells can make
that,"androgen-binding protein,"
13636.34,and you get enhanced
spermatogenesis.,
13638.62,You can find evidence for all
of,"these different features,"
13641.08,both changes to the
chemical,milieu-- that
13642.85,"is, the hormones-- and changes"
to,"the mechanical milieu,"
13645.34,"including, for instance,"
improvement,of the pathways
13648.64,leading from the seminiferous
tubules,to the epididymis
13651.16,"to the vas deferens, basically"
clearing,out the plumbing so
13653.95,that more quality
ejaculate,"can be delivered,"
13656.14,"which, of course, is going"
to,increase the probability
13658.39,of fertilization.
13659.84,So when you hear
that,acupuncture
13661.45,can improve the
likelihood,"of pregnancy,"
13663.94,that's an accurate statement for
which,there are now increasing
13666.67,amounts of mechanistic data.
13668.62,If you want to learn more
about,how acupuncture
13670.9,can be used to contribute
to,improved fertilization
13673.84,"and pregnancy,"
there,are a number
13675.58,of different excellent
reviews,"on this,"
13677.65,both as it relates to females
and,as it relates to males.
13681.53,One of the best papers
that,I happen to like
13683.98,is one that we'll
provide,a link to
13685.527,in the references entitled
Acupuncture,"and Herbal
13687.61 Medicine for Female Fertility,
An Overview of Systematic
13690.58 Review, so a review of reviews."
13693.4,This was published
recently,in 2021.
13696.242,We'll provide a link to that.
13697.45,And there's also going to
be,a link to a review that
13701.08,relates to acupuncture for
male,fertility and hormone
13704.11,augmentation.
13705.1,I should just mention
briefly,that if you're
13707.35,going to look at
scientific,"papers,"
13709.51,one thing that you'll
want,to consider
13711.28,is also looking at the
references,that they reference.
13713.748,"Now, of course, papers tend to"
reference,"a ton of references,"
13716.29,in particular in reviews.
13717.435,So what you'll
want,to do is look
13718.81,for the references
that,are showing up
13720.7,most often in the introduction.
13722.77,Those references
often,are going to be
13724.9,the most prominent recent
reviews,or the most important
13728.17,findings in recent years.
13729.52,"That's not always the case,"
but,that's often the case.
13731.96,So if you read the first couple
of,paragraphs of these papers--
13734.585,and these are openly available
as,"full text, by the way,"
13737.18,online if you go
to,these links--
13738.61,you'll be able to access the
best,"papers, the most relevant"
13742.0,"papers, in the context"
of,acupuncture supporting
13744.94,female and acupuncture
supporting,male fertility
13748.63,and hormone status.
13749.68,"Now, I'd like to discuss things"
that,both men and women can
13752.74,take in order to
maximize,their fertility.
13755.32,"And again and again, when"
we're,"talking about fertility,"
13759.56,we're talking about people
who,want to conceive and have
13762.26,"children, but also we're"
talking,about a basic measure
13766.58,of overall health status.
13768.06,So if you're somebody who does
not,"want to conceive children,"
13770.96,I still encourage you to
think,about whether or not
13773.57,you would want to
do,certain things
13775.04,or not do certain
things,in order
13777.11,to maximize your fertility as a
means,to maximize your vitality
13781.28,"and longevity,"
because,that's really
13782.84,what maximizing fertility is
about,for a lot of people.
13786.05,"That said, I know"
a,lot of people
13787.61,would like to conceive
"children,",perhaps not right away
13789.99,but in the future.
13790.85,And what I'm about
to,describe are
13792.5,some tools and
interventions,that is things
13795.11,that one can take in order to
improve,their hormone status
13800.09,"but also, in particular,"
the,quality of their eggs
13803.15,and the quality of their sperm
in,the short and long term.
13806.52,The first on the list of things
that,people can take in order
13809.36,to improve egg quality or
sperm,quality is L-carnitine.
13813.26,L-carnitine is present
in,"various foods,"
13815.63,in particular in red meats.
13817.31,"But again, it's going"
to,be very hard to get
13819.32,sufficient levels of L-carnitine
to,improve egg quality
13821.9,"and sperm quality, the"
unless,you're going
13823.67,to take it in supplement form.
13825.05,"The typical recommendation,"
based,on peer-reviewed studies
13828.29,that have shown significant
improvements,in egg quality--
13830.84,that is chromosomal
"arrangements,",
13833.09,that is the likelihood of
fertility--,"or pregnancy,"
13835.91,rather--
13836.45,the likelihood of
sperm,being forward
13839.3,fast swimmers as opposed
to,twitchers or immotile
13841.55,and having proper morphology--
all,those measures
13843.71,has been demonstrated to
be,significantly improved
13847.37,by the ingestion of L-carnitine.
13848.87,How much L-carnitine?
13850.04,"Well, that depends on how you're"
obtaining,the L-carnitine.
13852.53,If you're obtaining
it,"in capsule form,"
13856.01,1 to 3 grams per day of
capsule,form L-carnitine
13860.36,is what's been suggested to
improve,egg quality and sperm
13863.39,quality.
13864.05,"Now, 1 to 3 grams per day"
can,be taken all at once
13867.29,or spread out throughout
the,24-hour cycle.
13869.33,It can be taken with
or,without food.
13871.865,It does not seem to matter.
13873.78,And when taken for a
period,"of 30 to 60 days,"
13877.61,it does seem to
significantly,improve
13879.56,all the parameters that
have,been discussed for egg
13881.93,quality and sperm quality.
13883.64,"Now, the mechanism for that"
effect,is pretty clear.
13886.16,L-carnitine is involved in the
processing,"of lipids, fats,"
13891.53,in terms of
mitochondrial,function.
13894.21,And as we talked about
"before,",mitochondria
13896.42,are vital for the organization
and,action of the spindle that
13900.56,pulls apart the
"chromosomes,",taking
13902.21,that cell within the female
from,"diploid to haploid,"
13906.26,which is essential.
13907.37,You really want just the 23
individual,chromosomal strands.
13911.12,You don't want
chromosomal,repeats.
13913.64,It's also involved in the
actual,fusion of the egg
13916.79,as it exits the ovary and
enters,the ovulation cycle.
13921.022,"Mitochondria are also important,"
as,"we talked about before,"
13923.48,for the forward motility
of,sperm because
13925.22,of the enrichment
of,mitochondria
13926.595,in that mid region
just,behind the head.
13928.28,They cause the
whipping,flagellation
13930.62,"of the tail, allowing"
for,"forward movement,"
13932.93,as well as other aspects
of,cellular morphology.
13935.31,So it makes a lot of sense as to
why,L-carnitine supplementation
13938.847,would be beneficial.
13939.68,"Again, it's 1 to 3 grams per"
day,over a period of about 30
13942.76,to 60 months.
13943.453,If you're hoping to conceive
in,"the upcoming months,"
13945.62,recommend taking it for at
least,30 days prior to that.
13949.31,"Of course, based on the data"
we,talked about before--
13952.1,"cumulative probability,"
"fecundability,",
13954.08,et cetera-- there's
no,reason to not
13955.73,continue to try for
pregnancy,before taking
13957.74,"L-carnitine, but L-carnitine is"
going,to improve egg and sperm
13961.07,quality.
13961.64,And so you might actually
take,"the stance that,"
13965.66,even if you don't have any
problem,"getting pregnant,"
13968.42,wouldn't you want to
maximize,the quality
13970.94,of the egg that gets fertilized
and,the quality of the sperm
13973.73,that fertilizes that egg?
13975.27,So that's additional rationale
for,taking L-carnitine.
13978.29,One important note--
if,you are going
13980.45,to take L-carnitine in
oral,"form, in capsule form,"
13983.66,it can increase
something,called TMAO.
13986.03,TMAO can cause stiffening
of,the arteries.
13988.43,You don't want TMAO
levels,to go too high.
13990.8,One way to offset the
increases,in TMAO caused
13993.68,by oral L-carnitine is
to,take 600 milligrams
13996.95,of garlic per day.
13998.602,I suppose you could
eat,cloves of garlic.
14000.31,That would work just as
well,because garlic contains
14002.26,something called
"allicin,",which can
14003.82,offset the increase in TMAO.
14006.01,But 600 milligram capsules
of,garlic are going to be--
14009.55,"or garlic extract, rather--"
14011.78,is going to be the most probably
cost,effective and simplest way
14016.3,to do this.
14017.17,"And also, they are going to"
create,that garlic smell.
14019.388,Some people like
the,smell of garlic.
14020.93,Some people don't.
14021.68,So if you're going to
take,"oral L-carnitine,"
14023.62,I suggest also
taking,600 milligrams
14025.72,a day of garlic extract.
14027.985,And you can do that at any
time,throughout the day.
14030.11,It doesn't have to be
with,the L-carnitine.
14032.442,The next item on the list of
compounds,that have been shown
14034.9,to improve egg quality
and,sperm quality--
14037.03,and quite robustly so--
14038.98,is coenzyme Q10.
14040.6,Coenzyme Q10 is something
that,you can actually measure
14043.45,levels of in your blood.
14045.183,Most physicians
will,say that they
14046.6,want to see your
levels,of coenzyme Q10
14048.4,to be somewhere
between,0.5 and 2.5.
14050.673,It's going to
depend,on the units.
14052.09,"Most people, I"
"realize,",are not going
14053.632,to run off and get
their,CoQ10 measured.
14055.75,It's not included in most
standard,blood tests.
14057.82,But if you were to
measure,"your CoQ10,"
14059.5,that's the range that
you,want to look for.
14061.63,"That said, many people opt"
to,supplement with CoQ10.
14065.08,And you'll find that many
fertility,"docs, OB/GYNs,"
14068.56,and urologists that are trying
to,assist their male patients
14071.08,with fertility
will,suggest CoQ10
14072.7,"because, again, it supports"
the,health of mitochondria.
14076.18,Mitochondria are so vital to so
many,aspects of the formation
14080.53,and fertilization of
the,"egg and sperm that,"
14085.27,"of course, fertilizes the egg."
14087.58,The coenzyme Q10 dosages
that,are most often suggested
14091.0,and that you'll observe in
the,peer-reviewed research
14094.15,literature-- on
"humans,",I should add--
14096.13,is 100 to 400
milligrams,per day.
14099.55,And the coenzyme Q10
is,taken generally
14102.49,with a meal and ideally
a,meal that contains fat.
14105.61,And there's even some idea
that,taking coenzyme Q10
14108.82,"with your dinner, assuming that"
dinner,includes some fat-- you
14112.773,don't have to add
additional,fat--
14114.19,is going to be more advantageous
than,taking coenzyme Q10 early
14117.85,"in the day, although"
that's,probably
14119.35,a detail that's getting a little
too,far down in the weeds.
14121.808,"So again, 100 to 400 milligrams"
of,"coenzyme Q10 per day,"
14124.9,whether or not you're
a,"man or a woman,"
14126.61,for improving the
likelihood,of fertility
14129.31,by way of improving
egg,and sperm quality.
14131.56,"And again, if you're somebody"
who,just doesn't have
14133.685,any problem getting pregnant
or,if you're already producing
14136.33,many sperm of
quality,"morphology,"
14138.467,this is another case in which
you,could take a step back
14140.8,"and say, well, why wouldn't"
I,want to further optimize
14143.26,the quality of the
egg,"and the sperm,"
14144.55,because the quality of
the,egg and the sperm
14145.96,ultimately are
going,to determine
14147.64,not just whether or not you
have,a successful pregnancy
14149.95,"but are going to determine,"
admittedly,in ways that will
14154.22,forever remain cryptic
to,you-- but nonetheless
14156.62,are going to be
important,in determining
14158.54,the qualities of the
brain,tissue and body
14161.21,tissue of your offspring.
14162.71,The third item on the list of
compounds,which are commonly
14165.5,suggested or prescribed
by,fertility docs
14169.7,nowadays for men
and,women wishing
14171.23,to conceive and/or
optimize,their fertility
14173.48,as a basis for general vitality
and,health is inositol.
14177.74,"Now, inositol has many uses."
14179.85,So you'll hear about
the,use of inositol
14181.52,for reducing anxiety
or,improving mood
14183.663,or even for the
treatment,of depression.
14185.33,We talked about inositol
in,previous episodes
14187.37,of this podcast.
14188.81,"For instance, I"
talked,about inositol
14191.51,and in particular taking 900
milligrams,of myo-inositol
14195.29,"prior to sleep, which"
is,"something that I do,"
14197.48,along with the other supplements
that,I take and recommend
14200.33,"for sleep, such as magnesium 3"
and,"8, apigenin, and theanine."
14204.313,If you're curious
about,"those, you"
14205.73,can see our newsletter on sleep
or,"our ""Perfect Your Sleep"""
14208.16,"episode or the ""Master"
Your,"Sleep"" episode."
14209.75,It talks about behavioral and
supplementation-based,tools
14212.125,for improving sleep.
14213.11,But myo-inositol is not just
suggested,for or prescribed
14218.21,for people that are
wishing,to get pregnant
14221.21,and for general health.
14222.59,But myo-inositol is
often,recommended
14225.32,for people that want to improve
egg,and sperm quality because
14229.49,of the way that
it,can positively
14230.99,impact insulin sensitivity.
14232.85,Insulin sensitivity might sound
like,a bad thing to people
14236.0,out there.
14236.58,But it turns out that you
want,to be insulin sensitive.
14239.84,The last thing you want is
to,be insulin insensitive.
14242.48,Insulin insensitivity is
associated,with type 2
14244.55,"diabetes, with obesity,"
and,even for people
14246.83,who are not challenged
with,"obesity,"
14249.53,you want your cells to
be,insulin sensitive.
14251.867,You don't want a lot of insulin
floating,around in your system
14254.45,with your cells unable
to,use that insulin.
14257.87,That's really what insulin
insensitivity,is about.
14260.15,"Myo-inositol, at dosages"
of,1 to 5 grams per day--
14265.342,"that's pretty high,"
1,"to 5 grams per day,"
14267.05,"keeping in mind that 1,000"
milligrams,is 1 gram--
14270.2,has been suggested to improve
egg,quality and sperm quality.
14273.83,"Now, one point of--"
14275.63,I wouldn't say
caution--,but of note
14277.22,is that myo-inositol
can,"reduce anxiety,"
14279.927,and it can be a
slight,"sedative, which"
14281.51,"is why some folks, including"
"myself,","take almost a gram, 900"
14285.5,"milligrams, prior to sleep."
14287.69,If you're going to take
5,"grams of myo-inositol,"
14290.84,you would want to restrict
that,to the late evening
14293.315,or second half of your day.
14294.44,And I don't suggest
starting,that high.
14296.065,I would start with 1
or,2 grams and then
14297.95,working your way
"up,",seeing what you
14299.45,can tolerate in terms of
the,level of anti-anxiety
14303.5,and drowsiness that it produces.
14306.26,1 to 5 grams per
day,of myo-inositol
14308.75,is what's suggested for both
men,and women wishing to improve
14312.89,egg health and sperm health.
14314.18,"But for women, it's also often"
suggested,to include also--
14319.04,"so to take myo-inositol, but"
to,also take D-chiro inositol.
14323.6,D-chiro inositol
has,elements in it
14326.69,that can be both pro
and,anti-androgenic.
14330.11,Androgens are things like
testosterone,and related
14332.42,molecules.
14333.44,There are a number of
different,causes of infertility
14336.35,and disruption to egg
"quality,",age being the most
14339.44,significant factor.
14340.55,But another significant
and,very common
14343.13,"factor, even among young"
women,"who are of fertile age,"
14346.73,is having too many androgens
and,as it relates to something
14350.36,called polycystic
ovarian,syndrome.
14352.37,We'll do an entire episode
about,menopause and PCOS
14354.775,and a number of
other,things that
14356.15,relate to fertility because
it's,an entire and very
14359.78,interesting other discussion
that,we need to have.
14362.19,But the recommendation
is,that women
14363.71,take 1 to 5 grams
of,myo-inositol
14366.26,but also D-chiro inositol
because,of the ways
14370.16,that it can balance
androgens,and offset some
14373.07,of the negative effects of
polycystic,ovarian syndrome
14376.31,or even for women who do
not,have polycystic ovarian
14378.92,syndrome because of the ways
that,D-chiro inositol can
14381.83,balance androgens in
ways,that are beneficial.
14384.71,The dosages of D-chiro
inositol,that are recommended
14388.55,tend to be 1/25 to 1/40
of,the myo-inositol dose.
14393.01,So you'll have to get
out,your calculator.
14394.76,"Remember, 1,000"
milligrams,equals 1 gram.
14396.95,"So figure out, if you're"
taking,1 gram of myo-inositol
14399.74,"per day or 2 grams,"
you're,going to want
14402.11,to convert that to milligrams.
14403.76,So let's say you're taking 2
grams,of myo-inositol per day.
14407.18,"That's 2,000 milligrams."
14408.38,Then you'd want to
divide,that by 25.
14410.75,And that's how many
milligrams,of D-chiro inositol
14413.96,"you would want to take, as well."
14415.59,Or you could go with the lower
end,dose and divide it by 40
14418.73,and take that number of
milligrams,of D-chiro inositol
14423.08,along with the inositol.
14424.31,"Again, probably taking it later"
in,the day is going to be good.
14427.16,And it's not clear
at,all that taking it
14429.373,with food or without food makes
any,difference whatsoever.
14431.79,So I would suggest
you,do either.
14433.67,"Keep in mind, as I'm discussing"
these,"recommendations,"
14436.26,I may call them prescriptions.
14437.51,But none of these are
prescription,drugs.
14439.218,"And of course, you should"
always,discuss any supplements
14441.74,that you're planning to take or
stop,"taking, for that matter,"
14444.8,with your physician.
14445.67,I don't say that to protect me.
14446.962,I say that to protect you.
14448.107,Any time you're going
to,add or change
14449.69,something in your
overall,"health regimen,"
14451.398,you want to discuss that
with,your trusted health care
14454.2,"professional, typically, I would"
"hope,",a board-certified MD.
14457.5,The fourth item in the list of
commonly,suggested supplements
14461.55,for men and women wishing to
optimize,"egg and sperm quality,"
14465.36,"respectively, is"
omega-3,fatty acids.
14468.477,"And now, here, we're"
talking,about something
14470.31,that could be obtained from food
and,can be obtained from food.
14472.935,So if you're consuming
fatty,"ocean fish, things"
14475.89,"like sardines, anchovies,"
salmon,"with the skin,"
14479.19,chances are you're going to
get,some quality omega-3s.
14482.61,Omega-3s are also available
in,plant-based sources.
14485.65,It's also available in
"krill,",for that matter.
14487.98,But most people find
it,difficult to reach
14489.93,the threshold required
for,optimizing
14493.2,mental health and
physical,health
14494.61,that is the threshold of the
EPA,essential fatty acids.
14497.83,And so for that
"matter,",I've suggested
14500.07,before on this podcast--
14501.27,and many fertility
docs,will suggest--
14503.31,that their patients take omega-3
fatty,acids in supplement form.
14508.22,It could be taken in liquid
form,"or in capsule form,"
14510.56,but enough of those that you're
getting,at least 1 gram per day
14513.95,"of the EPA form of omega-3,"
so,at least 1 gram per day
14517.82,and as high as 2 or even 3
grams,per day of the EPA form.
14521.625,So you'll need to
look,at the packaging
14523.25,because oftentimes it'll
say,high potency omega-3.
14525.86,"It'll say 1,500"
milligrams,of omega-3s.
14530.06,"But that's not 1,500"
milligrams,of the EPA form.
14533.028,You look on the back of
the,"label, and it'll say,"
14535.07,each serving contains
750,milligrams of EPA.
14538.88,You want to get above
that,1 gram dosage per day
14542.12,and as high as 3 grams
per,day of the EPAs.
14545.06,The most cost-effective
way,to do
14546.47,that is going to be
liquid-form,"omegas,"
14548.652,but that's a little bit
inconvenient,"for many people,"
14550.86,and some people
don't,like the taste.
14552.402,That's why they rely on
the,capsule-form omegas.
14554.66,"And of course,"
there,are compounds
14556.31,that can impact
fertility,"status, quality"
14558.92,"of eggs, quality of sperm,"
not,by adjusting mitochondria
14562.55,or insulin sensitivity
or,creating
14565.01,a general milieu of support
for,the egg and the sperm
14568.46,"production and function, such"
as,the compounds that I just
14572.6,"listed off do, but"
rather,compounds
14576.28,that influence the
hormones,involved
14578.17,in the generation of sperm and
the,"generation of the eggs,"
14580.72,involved in the ovulatory cycle
and,"the spermatogenesis cycle,"
14584.02,that is.
14584.74,"Now, these are going to"
come,in different forms.
14587.57,And I want to just emphasize
that,the supplements that
14590.83,"do this, that adjust"
hormones,in these ways that
14592.9,"can be beneficial, are"
distinct,from hormone therapy
14596.35,"or bioidentical hormones,"
distinct,from hormone therapy
14599.733,or bioidentical
"hormones,","because,"
14601.15,as we discussed
"earlier,",when you take
14603.88,a hormone like testosterone or
even,"estrogen, for that matter,"
14606.59,"from an exogenous,"
an,"outside source,"
14608.38,you're going to disrupt
the,feedback pathways
14610.797,"inside of your body, and"
you're,going to shut down
14612.88,your own endogenous production.
14614.65,The supplements I'm about
to,describe do not do that
14618.31,and yet can adjust levels of
hormones,in more subtle ways
14621.7,that can be beneficial for the
process,of maximizing fertility
14626.29,for males and for females.
14627.85,The first of which on this
list,that I'd like to discuss
14630.305,has been discussed
in,previous podcasts
14631.93,"as well, which is a"
substance,called tongkat ali.
14634.63,Tongkat ali also
goes,by other names.
14637.42,But when taken at 400
milligrams,"per day,"
14640.03,sometimes separated
into,two dosages
14641.59,but typically taken as
once,a day early in the day
14644.92,because they can be a little
bit,"stimulating, although not"
14648.28,anxiety provoking--
14649.12,I've never heard of that.
14650.362,It can be a little
bit,stimulating.
14651.82,But 400 milligrams
a,day of tongkat ali
14653.71,has been shown to
increase,free testosterone
14656.608,by way of reducing something
called,sex hormone binding
14658.9,globulin.
14659.4,It's also been shown to
increase,"luteinizing hormone,"
14661.9,the net effect of which
has,been described
14664.57,as a subtle but significant
increase,in libido
14668.65,and some of the other parameters
associated,with increased
14671.86,"androgens, like free"
testosterone,in males
14673.84,and females.
14674.35,So a number of people out
there,are taking tongkat ali
14676.6,in this way--
14677.142,400 milligrams per
"day,",restricted
14678.61,to the early part of the
"day,",with or without food.
14682.45,"People always ask, do you"
need,to cycle tongkat ali?
14684.88,I'm not aware of any need
to,cycle tongkat ali.
14687.07,"In fact, it tends"
to,"work better,"
14688.75,meaning the effects on libido
and,some other hormone profiles
14692.11,tend to increase over time.
14693.82,"Again, tongkat ali is an option."
14696.31,"Certainly, none of these"
things,are requirements.
14698.44,We're simply
listing,off options.
14699.97,"But many people, both"
males,"and females,"
14702.22,seem to benefit from
and,"like tongkat ali,"
14705.34,even if they're not
seeking,to conceive.
14707.53,There's no reason to think
that,tongkat ali directly
14709.9,improves sperm quality.
14711.49,"Except in males, the increase in"
androgen,created by tongkat ali
14715.12,supplementation can indeed lead
to,improved spermatogenesis.
14718.93,So there's a growing amount
of,data in the research
14721.627,literature on tongkat ali.
14722.71,Many people find it beneficial.
14724.34,And so it's something that
both,men and women wishing
14726.61,to conceive and/or optimize
their,fertility just
14729.01,as a general health parameter
might,want to explore.
14731.86,The other supplement that's
been,shown to improve both egg
14735.64,quality and sperm quality--
14738.46,and there I'm
referring,to a number
14739.937,of different parameters related
to,egg quality and sperm
14742.27,quality--
14742.9,as well as to increase
libido,fairly substantially
14746.92,is a substance called Shilajit.
14748.87,"Shilajit, spelled"
S-H-I-L-A-G-I-T--,
14753.55,Shilajit is actually
a,compound that's
14757.18,used in ayurvedic
"medicine,",but there
14759.04,are some really good
research,studies exploring
14761.5,the supplementation with
Shilajit,at about 250
14765.34,milligrams twice per day.
14767.12,And this has been looked
at,in males and in females.
14769.66,And it does seem to
significantly,increase
14771.97,two hormones.
14772.93,"One is testosterone,"
and,the other
14775.12,is follicle-stimulating hormone.
14777.43,"And for that reason, Shilajit"
is,often considered a tonic
14781.06,that people use both as an
aphrodisiac,to increase libido
14785.53,as well as to
increase,fertility.
14788.08,"Now, one note of caution,"
if,you're a woman
14790.99,and you're considering
taking,Shilajit in order
14792.983,to increase testosterone and
follicle-stimulating,"hormone,"
14795.4,keep in mind that
the,ovulatory cycle
14797.08,is this very tightly
regulated,cycle in which you
14801.28,want low but elevated levels
of,follicle-stimulating hormone
14805.3,early in the
follicular,"phase, then"
14807.01,it peaks right before
"ovulation,",and then low levels
14810.087,of follicle-stimulating
hormone,in the second half
14812.17,of your cycle.
14812.77,"For that reason, using"
Shilajit,chronically
14815.8,around the entire course
of,your ovulatory cycle
14818.74,could be a little
bit,"risky, and I'd"
14820.24,recommend that you talk to
your,OB/GYN prior to doing that
14824.38,or if doing that at all.
14826.72,"For males, it's a little"
bit,"less of an issue,"
14828.67,"because, as I mentioned"
"earlier,",sperm are constantly
14830.878,"being generated, and"
the,presence of FSH
14833.83,is going to increase
spermatogenesis.,
14836.32,"Now, Shilajit is not FSH itself."
14839.23,Shilajit stimulates
the,release of FSH.
14842.26,And it stimulates the
release,of testosterone.
14844.24,"So again, there's"
no,reason to think
14845.74,that it would shut down your
endogenous,testosterone or FSH
14848.56,production.
14849.91,Although there are limited
amount,of data that really
14852.4,explore that in detail.
14853.78,Many people use
Shilajit,in order
14856.57,to increase their
"testosterone,","FSH,"
14858.82,"their libido, and various"
aspects,of sperm health.
14863.95,"Again, the dosages of Shilajit"
are,"about 250 milligrams,"
14866.83,two times per day.
14867.67,One issue with
Shilajit,is it often
14869.14,"comes as a tar, which is a"
little,hard to measure out
14872.11,the dosages.
14872.86,"Yes, a tar."
14873.94,It's this kind of
"thick,",gummy substance
14876.04,that you're supposed
to,dissolve in water.
14877.79,And the recommendations
are,you take a little bead
14879.873,and dissolve it in water.
14881.04,It is available in
capsule,form where
14882.71,the ability to
control,the dosage
14885.56,is made a little bit easier.
14886.95,"But of course, as"
with,"any supplement,"
14888.65,I recommend starting with
the,lowest possible dosage.
14891.08,So you might want to start with
a,very small bead of Shilajit
14894.8,"dissolved in water,"
taken,"once per day,"
14896.79,and then increase
the,dosage as needed
14898.85,in order to obtain the
effects,that you want.
14901.4,Things like Shilajit
start,to bring us
14903.5,into the realm of
what,can only be
14905.33,described as a little
bit,"unwieldy, right?"
14907.1,Here we're saying you can't
really,control the dosage.
14908.99,Now you're talking
about,hormones
14910.365,that need to be tightly
"regulated,",at least for females
14912.77,across the ovarian cycle.
14913.91,"For males, yes,"
it,has been shown
14915.59,to increase
testosterone,"and FSH,"
14917.72,improve sperm motility and sperm
count,pretty significantly.
14921.65,No reason to think that you
couldn't,do that chronically
14923.99,with Shilajit.
14924.65,"And yet, I do want to"
acknowledge,"that Shilajit,"
14927.44,as this black tar
"substance,",contains
14929.99,a lot of different things.
14931.2,"In fact, it comes"
from,a mineral pitch.
14933.14,What is that?
14933.76,It comes from literally
the,dirt and plants
14936.2,that have been compressed
by,rocks in the Himalayas.
14938.56,So that's pretty esoteric
stuff,when it really
14940.622,comes down to it.
14941.33,But the biological
effects,"of Shilajit,"
14943.7,"in both males and females,"
seem,to be related to the fact
14946.49,that it is highly enriched in
something,"called folic acid,"
14949.46,and folic acid is
involved,in a lot
14951.17,"of different cellular processes,"
not,"the least of which,"
14953.78,"at least in this context, is"
the,transport of molecules
14957.92,across cell membranes.
14959.337,And for hormones to
have,"their effect,"
14960.92,they need to cross cell
membranes,on the outside
14962.92,and the inside of the cell.
14964.588,So maybe that's how
it's,having its effect.
14966.38,"Again, the mechanisms of"
exactly,how Shilajit increases
14969.92,testosterone and FSH and
thereby,"libido, egg quality,"
14973.31,and sperm quality
aren't,entirely clear.
14975.32,But for the more
adventurous,of you out there
14978.068,who want to experiment
with,"Shilajit,"
14979.61,whether or not you're
trying,"to conceive or not,"
14982.43,it might be something
to,consider.
14983.87,"But of course, do talk"
to,your physician.
14985.7,The next compound that I
want,to discuss is zinc.
14988.91,And this discussion
mainly,"pertains to males,"
14991.31,"although I, of course,"
should,point out
14993.26,that females should get the
recommended,daily allowance
14996.74,of zinc each day.
14998.0,"Males, on the other"
"hand,",seem to benefit
15000.58,from having additionally
high,levels of zinc intake.
15004.163,"Now, that can be"
obtained,through foods.
15005.83,"You often hear, oh, oysters"
are,"enriched in zinc,"
15008.62,and oysters are an aphrodisiac.
15011.205,I don't know who's doing
the,"marketing for oysters,"
15013.33,but it's really terrific.
15015.08,I think that seems
to,have persisted.
15016.69,And maybe it's true.
15019.51,Oysters are enriched in zinc.
15021.04,What does zinc do for fertility?
15023.87,"Well, in males, we know,"
based,on a really nice set
15026.74,"of studies, that"
zinc,dosages that
15029.23,are pretty high of
about,120 milligrams
15031.72,taken twice per day--
15033.73,that's quite a lot-- with
meals,can significantly
15037.24,increase testosterone
and,dihydrotestosterone.
15040.54,And this probably shouldn't
come,as a surprise to us.
15042.86,It turns out that zinc is
highly,enriched in human testes
15046.54,and in the testes
of,"other animals,"
15048.2,including fish
and,other mammals.
15049.72,And it was actually in 1921
that,it was observed in fish
15054.76,that zinc levels skyrocket
in,the testes of fish
15058.54,during their breeding season.
15060.02,So zinc is correlated with
increases,"in breeding,"
15062.973,but you never know
which,direction
15064.39,that correlation is running.
15065.77,It turns out that
zinc,"in both animals,"
15069.56,"including fish, other mammals,"
and,"in humans, strongly"
15073.06,impacts the enzymatic
functions,"in the testes,"
15075.55,including the function of
androgen-binding,protein.
15078.8,So it seems that
high,levels of zinc
15080.38,can increase spermatogenesis
and,testosterone
15082.75,levels very significantly.
15085.193,This was explored in
a,really nice study
15086.86,that I'll provide
a,reference to.
15087.88,It's an older study.
15088.73,But I really like.
15089.56,"It's called ""Effect"
of,Zinc Administration
15091.31,"on Plasma Testosterone,"
"Dihydrotestosterone,",
15093.55,"and Sperm Count."""
15094.75,This is but just one
study,among many now.
15098.29,"This dates back to 1981,"
but,there have been studies
15101.41,subsequently that point to
the,fact that supplementation
15103.81,with zinc at those
high,levels can really
15105.518,be helpful in
terms,of increasing
15108.4,"sperm count,"
"testosterone,",and even
15111.04,"testicular size, of all things."
15113.03,So one important
point,about taking
15115.75,zinc-- this 120 milligrams
of,zinc two times daily
15119.225,definitely needs to
be,done with meals.
15120.85,If you've ever taken
zinc,"on an empty stomach,"
15122.92,even if you just take 15
or,"30 milligrams of zinc,"
15125.59,"you can feel very nauseous,"
not,"well, for a few hours."
15129.1,So make sure that you're
taking,zinc with full meals.
15131.83,So this would mean that
you're,taking in at least
15134.59,two full meals per day.
15137.83,I should also mention that
zinc,supplementation did not
15140.26,appear to impact
gonadotropin-releasing,hormone
15143.2,or prolactin.
15143.89,So it seems to be a
fairly,targeted effect
15146.29,on the testosterone and
related,pathways in males.
15148.84,"As far as I know, there have"
not,been systematic explorations
15152.08,of the effects of high levels of
zinc,administration on females.
15155.325,I would hope that those
studies,would soon be done.
15157.45,"But meanwhile, if"
you're,a male and you're
15159.28,interested in
improving,sperm quality
15160.93,and your testosterone levels
overall,"for whatever reason,"
15164.02,zinc likely is a good candidate.
15166.0,And that pretty much
summarizes,the compounds
15168.28,that men and women
should,take in order
15170.35,"to maximize egg quality,"
sperm,"quality, and fertility."
15173.157,"And then, of course,"
we,start to enter
15174.74,the landscape of other things
that,men and women can take
15177.5,"in order to improve fertility,"
and,those other things
15180.26,generally are
prescription,drugs.
15182.39,And so I just want to mention
what,a few of those are.
15184.815,"But of course, these are things"
that,you would absolutely
15187.19,have to obtain prescriptions
for,"from your MD,"
15191.03,"and your MD, without"
"question,",would
15194.3,want to take blood tests prior
to,prescribing these things.
15197.22,"So for instance,"
if,men have been
15199.4,taking exogenous
testosterone,through the use
15202.1,"of anabolic steroids, like"
performance-enhancing,drugs
15204.56,or even testosterone
replacement,"therapy,"
15206.54,their endogenous
testosterone,levels
15208.19,"are going to be very low,"
and,their sperm counts
15210.193,"are going to be very low,"
"unless,","for instance, they"
15212.36,are prescribed and
taking,something
15213.89,"like hCG, human chorionic"
"gonadotropin,",which
15217.55,mimics LH and would stimulate
the,testes to produce
15220.16,testosterone and through
some,indirect pathways rescue
15223.4,"spermatogenesis, although"
not,to the same degree
15225.83,as if people are not
taking,exogenous sources
15229.1,of testosterone.
15230.33,"Some men, even if they've"
never,touched TRT or exogenous
15234.32,testosterone of any
"kind,",will be prescribed
15237.29,to take hCG because
of,its ability
15239.42,to stimulate the
testes,to produce
15241.31,more testosterone and sperm.
15242.7,So they're just
taking,hCG alone.
15244.61,Other men will take--
15245.84,"or will be prescribed, rather--"
15247.43,FSH in order to stimulate
"spermatogenesis,",or hCG
15250.64,"and FSH, or clomiphene,"
which,can regulate
15254.18,all sorts of things in
the,both testosterone and
15256.49,estrogen-related pathways at
the,level of brain and pituitary
15260.81,"and gonad, testes."
15263.54,"Likewise, for women,"
if,"they're low in FSH,"
15265.85,they might be prescribed FSH.
15267.77,If they are low in
luteinizing,"hormone,"
15270.68,they might be prescribed hCG.
15272.15,If they're low in
"testosterone,",they might even
15273.71,be prescribed testosterone.
15274.85,And if their
testosterone,is too high
15276.41,and they're dealing
with,"PCOS, they"
15277.88,might be prescribed
anti-androgens,and androgen
15280.82,blockers and on and on and on.
15283.32,There are so many
different,hormones that
15285.26,can impact the different
aspects,of the ovulatory
15287.6,and the spermatogenesis
cycle,that the OB/GYNs
15291.95,and the urologists focused on
male,fertility nowadays really
15295.04,have an excellent handle
on,which levers and buttons
15297.83,and threads to pull and
push,and so forth in order
15300.59,to set in motion
a,proper ovulatory
15303.14,cycle and a proper
spermatogenesis,cycle.
15306.08,Everything we talked
about,up until now
15308.305,and in the early
phase,"of this episode,"
15309.93,"especially, about how"
the,brain commands
15312.92,the pituitary and the pituitary
commands,the gonads and then
15315.89,"the gonads, the"
"ovary,",or the testes
15317.72,send feedback signals
to,the pituitary
15320.0,to then influence
the,"pituitary, all"
15321.98,of that incredible
"orchestra,","that dance,"
15324.44,is so tightly regulated in
a,way that really provides
15327.92,the OB/GYNs and
the,fertility docs
15329.99,concerned with male fertility
exceptional,"tools to,"
15333.26,"for instance, figure out if a"
man,is not producing any sperm
15336.86,but his testosterone levels
are,"well within normal range,"
15340.28,"well, then there are some very"
clear,sets of explorations
15343.018,and potential treatments.
15344.06,Some of which are
"mechanical,",making sure
15345.768,the epididymis and vas
deferens,"are clear,"
15347.69,allowing the sperm to
enter,the ejaculate
15349.79,and the ejaculate
to,enter the urethra
15351.47,and obviously to enter
the,"female, as well"
15355.93,as for a woman
who's,not ovulating
15357.88,to adjust her levels of FSH or
maybe,even to apply acupuncture
15362.65,in conjunction with
supplementation,
15364.39,and various prescription
hormone,therapies to adjust
15367.87,fertility and ovulation
and,the probability
15370.06,of successful pregnancy.
15371.93,So there's a vast landscape
of,prescription drugs
15374.56,and surgical interventions
of,varying degrees
15377.35,of invasiveness.
15379.33,"And some are, for instance,"
outpatient,procedures.
15383.14,Some require general
"anesthesia,","et cetera,"
15385.27,in order to maximize male
and,female fertility.
15388.39,What I've tried to do
today,is to provide you
15391.81,with a deep dive understanding
of,the ovulatory and menstrual
15396.39,cycle.
15396.89,"We talked about the brain,"
the,"pituitary, the ovary,"
15398.71,the Fallopian
"tubes,","and, in fact,"
15400.13,the whole female
reproductive,axis
15401.77,as it relates to
fertility,and reproduction
15406.15,I also describe the male
reproductive,axis as it relates
15410.62,"to the brain, the pituitary,"
the,"gonad, the testes,"
15413.2,and the various
"ducts,","the pathways,"
15415.18,out of the testes that allow
the,sperm to be enriched
15419.8,within the semen and then
the,semen and the ejaculate
15422.29,to exit through the urethra.
15424.15,I did all that as a way
to,frame the various tools
15426.85,and interventions
that,can really
15429.07,"assist in increasing fertility,"
egg,"quality, and sperm quality."
15433.4,So when we discuss
mitochondria,in the context
15435.58,of the development of an egg
or,the development of sperm
15438.61,and its ability to
swim,"quickly forward,"
15441.7,now it should make
sense,as to why
15443.62,"give an intervention,"
whether,or not
15445.12,it's L-carnitine
or,whether or not
15446.537,it's exercise or whether or
not,it's getting enough sleep
15448.912,"and limiting stress, why all"
that,"should matter and why,"
15451.27,"in fact, mechanistically"
those,interventions can work.
15454.765,"Because, indeed, there"
are,many interventions
15456.64,that we can all do and use
to,support our fertility.
15460.33,"And again, as a more"
general,"theme today,"
15462.52,"I really wanted to,"
"A,",teach you about
15464.71,the human reproductive axis--
15466.6,I do find the biology of the
ovulatory,and menstrual cycle
15470.23,and spermatogenesis to be
absolutely,fascinating to me.
15473.4,"And again, if you're somebody"
who's,interested in conceiving
15475.9,or if you've already
conceived,children
15477.73,and even if you don't
want,"more children,"
15479.65,this is really the
aspect,of our biology
15482.26,that allowed us to be here.
15484.45,It's the aspect of our biology
that,determined whether or not
15487.84,we are male or female.
15489.1,It's the aspect of our biology
that,"determines so, so much,"
15491.74,and yet I think that most
of,us generally are not
15494.47,taught this in school or
at,least not at the depth
15496.66,that we discussed it today.
15498.37,So hopefully that information
was,in and of itself
15501.07,interesting and
perhaps,useful as well.
15503.42,And I do think that
even,if people are not
15505.21,wishing to conceive more
children,that the information
15508.06,related to fertility and
optimizing,egg and sperm health
15510.91,is of value in the sense that
optimizing,egg and sperm health
15515.2,can be used as a proxy for
optimizing,our body and brain
15519.07,health generally.
15519.82,In other words-- and here I'm
admittedly,taking words out
15524.05,of the mouths of the
various,"wonderful doctors,"
15526.87,the OB/GYNs and neurologists
that,helped inform me
15530.35,in anticipation of this
episode--,what is good
15532.9,for the woman is
good,for the egg
15535.03,and for fertility
and,for pregnancy.
15537.1,And what's good for the
man,is good for the quality
15541.42,and production of sperm and
for,fertility and pregnancy.
15545.56,"Put differently, whether or"
not,"we are male or female,"
15548.92,the things that we can do
to,optimize our fertility
15551.65,are the exact same
things,that we should all
15554.14,be doing to optimize our
vitality,and our longevity.
15557.57,And I realize today's episode
was,so much the deep dive
15560.59,"and fairly broad, as well,"
that,it ended up being
15563.56,fairly long and extensive.
15565.33,And yet we still
have,not touched
15567.378,on any of the important themes
that,I know a number of people
15569.92,"want to know about-- so,"
for,"instance, menopause,"
15573.43,"andropause, PCOS,"
and,other themes
15576.865,related to hormones and
reproductive,function
15578.74,and biology.
15579.47,And I promise that we will have
"episodes,",both solo episodes
15582.79,and episodes with expert
"guests,",in the future
15585.55,to cover all of those
topics,in detail.
15587.54,"Meanwhile, the information"
discussed,in today's episode
15590.23,should serve as a
basic,foundation
15592.51,for those discussions
going,forward
15594.07,and hopefully were of interest
to,you in their own right.

15629.59,"of the Huberman Lab podcast,"
we,discussed supplements.
15632.11,While supplements aren't
necessary,"for everybody,"

tremendous,benefit from them
15636.28,"for things like sleep,"
