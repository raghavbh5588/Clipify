0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.28,where we discuss science 
3.72,and science-based tools for everyday life. 
5.766,[upbeat music] 
9.36,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.38,and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology 
13.29,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.27,"Today, my guest is Ido Portal. "
17.61,Ido Portal is somebody who truly defies formal definition. 
21.93,"He is, however, accredited by many "
23.82,to be the world expert in all things movement. 
27.3,Movement is one of the more fascinating 
29.1,and important aspects of our nervous system. 
31.5,"In fact, it was the great Nobel Prize winner Sherrington "
34.71,"that said, ""Movement is the final common path."" "
37.38,And what he was referring to is the fact 
39.81,that so much of our nervous system is dedicated to movement 
43.05,"and, in particular, that the human nervous system "
45.72,can generate the greatest variety of forms of movement. 
49.29,"We can run, we can jump, we can crawl, "
51.27,we can move at different speeds. 
53.04,Far more variation in movement 
55.41,and different types and speeds of movement 
57.18,than any other animal in the animal kingdom can perform. 
61.53,My interest in bringing Ido Portal onto this podcast 
63.87,"stemmed from a discussion about just that, "
65.94,about Sherrington and the enormous range of movements 
68.79,that humans can engage in. 
70.23,Ido is both a practitioner and an intellectual. 
73.53,"We all know what a practitioner is, "
74.97,"it's somebody who walks the walk, "
76.32,who actually performs the thing 
78.3,that they are knowledgeable about. 
80.34,"And indeed, Ido has studied capoeira, "
83.31,"a number of other martial arts, "
84.63,"dance, gymnastics, various forms of sport, "
87.48,"he's trained top athletes like Conor McGregor, "
90.24,"and he has many, many other credits to his name "
92.76,as a practitioner and teacher. 
95.16,"However, he is also a true intellectual of movement. "
98.94,I define an intellectual as somebody 
101.13,who can both think about and talk about a subject 
104.31,at multiple levels of granularity 
106.41,that is with exquisite detail 
108.51,and with exquisite simplicity depending on their audience 
111.96,and depending on the topic at hand. 
113.61,"And as you'll soon hear from my discussion with Ido, "
116.31,he is both a practitioner and a true intellectual 
120.06,of all things movement. 
121.53,"Today, through our discussion, "
123.12,"you will learn how the nervous system generates movement, "
126.12,"and the different forms of movement, "
127.47,the different speeds of movement. 
129.0,You're also going to get an incredible insight 
131.25,through Ido's mind and eyes of how movement can serve us 
135.6,in the various context of life. 
137.7,"Not just in sport, not just in exercise, "
140.49,but in every aspect of our lives 
142.83,from the time we get up in the morning 
144.24,"until the time we go to sleep at night, "
146.19,"how we engage with others, how we engage with ourselves, "
148.98,"indeed, how movement even informs "
151.02,relationships of different kinds. 
153.54,I found our discussion to be one of the most enlightening 
156.66,"and interesting discussions that I've ever had, "
158.76,"not just about movement, but about the nervous system. "
162.12,"I can assure you that by the end of this episode, "
164.52,you will not only learn a tremendous amount about movement 
167.85,"through the eyes and mind of the one and only Ido Portal, "
171.39,but you also will learn a tremendous amount of neuroscience 
174.99,"about how the cells, and circuits, and hormones, "
177.3,and neurotransmitters of your body 
179.04,assist in creating the various forms of movement 
181.653,"that you can generate, "
183.03,"that you're trying to learn and generate, "
185.04,and that perhaps you should think about 
187.26,trying to learn and generate. 
188.88,"And indeed, you'll learn some protocols and tools "
190.89,for how to do that. 
192.0,"In science, we have a phrase, "
193.59,"actually it's a title, "
194.82,"that's reserved for only the rarest of individuals, "
198.33,we say that somebody is an n-of-
"1,",
201.03,meaning a sample size of one. 
202.95,"And as you'll soon learn, "
204.54,Ido Portal is truly an n-of-
1.,
207.36,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
209.88,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
212.49,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
214.41,to bring zero-cost to consumer information 
216.27,about science and science-related tools 
218.04,to the general public. 
219.39,"In keeping with that theme, "
220.44,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
223.11,Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. 
225.27,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one 
226.74,"vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink "
228.63,that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes. 
231.54,I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 
"2012,",
234.297,and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
236.7,"In fact, when people ask me, "
237.547,"""What's the one supplement they should take?"" "
239.79,"I always say, ""Athletic Greens "
241.14,because it covers all of those essential nutritional bases 
244.59,"and the probiotics, adaptogens, and digestive enzymes "
247.86,"are vital for things like the gut microbiome."" "
249.99,Your gut microbiome is trillions of little microbacteria 
253.44,"that live in your gut, and that support your immune system, "
255.66,"your endocrine system, and the so-called gut-brain axis, "
258.3,"which is important for mood and neurotransmitter production, "
260.97,a huge number of biological systems in your brain and body. 
264.57,Athletic Greens also taste great. 
266.01,I mix mine with water 
267.33,and I like a little bit of lemon juice 
268.59,or lime juice in there. 
269.52,"As I mentioned, I drink it twice a day, "
271.29,"usually once in the morning, "
272.67,during the phase of the day in which typically I'm fasting 
275.01,"or around breakfast time, "
276.09,and then again in the afternoon or even in the evening. 
278.37,"If you like to try Athletic Greens, "
279.66,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
282.33,to claim a special offer. 
283.8,"They'll give you five free travel packs, "
285.45,which make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
287.64,while you're on the road. 
289.23,And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D
"3,",K
2.,
292.71,Vitamin D
3,and K
2,"are important for endocrine health, "
296.64,"for cardiovascular health, "
297.9,"for calcium regulation, and so on. "
300.24,"Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman "
302.82,to claim this special offer. 
304.41,Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. 
307.069,"ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses, "
308.91,they're the absolute highest quality and practicality. 
312.54,"I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, "
314.64,and I can tell you that your visual system 
315.99,has to contend with an enormous number of challenges. 
318.06,"For instance, when you move from a shady area "
319.98,"to a bright area, your eyes have to adapt to that. "
322.86,ROKA understands the various challenges 
324.66,that the visual system has to face 
326.01,and they've developed sunglasses and eyeglasses 
328.41,with all of that biology in mind. 
330.81,Their glasses were developed 
331.89,by two All-American swimmers from Stanford. 
334.14,"And initially, ROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses "
336.54,were for athletes. 
338.25,They designed eyeglasses that then and still now 
340.92,will stay on your face if you get sweaty. 
342.45,"You can wear them running, "
343.47,"you can wear them cycling, et cetera. "
344.85,"They're very lightweight, "
345.78,so lightweight in fact that most of the time 
347.13,you don't even remember that they're on your face. 
349.11,But ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses 
350.76,also come in a terrific aesthetic 
352.29,so you can wear them anywhere. 
353.43,"So, unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses out there "
355.59,"that make people look like cyborgs, "
357.3,you can wear ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses 
359.34,"when exercising, to dinner, to work. "
361.86,"Again, the aesthetics are really terrific "
363.66,and really adaptable to all those different environments. 
365.94,"If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, "
367.47,"you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com, "
370.17,and enter the code HUBERMAN to get 
20%,off your first order. 
373.59,"Again, that's roka.com, "
375.51,enter the code HUBERMAN at checkout. 
377.58,Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. 
380.25,Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows 
382.38,that are customized to your sleep needs. 
385.26,"I've talked a lot on this podcast, "
386.697,"and on another podcast, and on social media "
388.71,about the essential need for sleep. 
390.78,"Put simply, sleep is the foundation of all mental health, "
393.75,"physical health, and performance. "
395.79,Just a few nights or even one night's poor sleep 
397.86,"can really hinder your mental health, "
399.63,"physical health, and performance in all aspects of life. "
403.14,"Helix has customized sleep products, "
406.02,that is mattresses and pillows that are designed 
408.27,to your sleep needs. 
409.38,And you can figure out what those sleep needs 
410.73,"are very easily by going to the helix website, "
413.1,"they have a quiz, it takes just about two minutes, "
415.08,"and ask you questions like do you sleep on your back, "
417.27,"your side, or your stomach? "
418.14,"Do you tend to run hot or cold during sleep, et cetera? "
420.57,"Or maybe you don't even know the answers to those questions, "
422.31,"that's fine too, "
423.143,that's an option that you can answer as well. 
426.03,You take the brief two-minute quiz 
427.53,and then Helix will match you 
429.15,to the ideal mattress and pillow for you. 
431.52,I matched to the so-called Dusk Mattress. 
434.22,"I started sleeping on that well over a year ago now, "
436.41,and it's the best sleep I've ever had. 
437.91,I'm sleeping much longer and much better 
441.51,through the entire night. 
442.59,"And as a consequence, I'm feeling much better, "
444.33,"more clear, more physically alert, et cetera, "
446.67,throughout the day. 
447.81,"If you're interested in upgrading your mattress, "
449.4,go to helixsleep.com/huberman. 
451.89,You can take that two-minute quiz 
452.97,"and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you, "
454.92,and you'll get up to $
200,off all mattress orders 
457.92,and two free pillows. 
459.39,"Again, if you're interested, "
460.223,you go to helixsleep.com/huberman 
462.48,for up to $
200,off and two free pillows. 
465.3,"And now, for my discussion with Ido Portal. "
468.6,"Ido, thank you for coming here today. "
471.78,I've been looking forward to sitting down with you 
473.49,to talk for a very long time. 
475.8,I was first exposed to your work 
478.53,from my post or a podcast I believe 
482.22,"of you had a group of people walking down handrails, "
486.3,literally the handrails along stairwells. 
488.22,"And as a, I don't want to say former skateboarder, "
490.89,"once a skateboarder, always a skateboarder. "
493.08,"As a skateboarder, handrails have a particular meaning, "
496.62,"but I was really struck by, first of all, "
501.21,the incredible range of skill that people had 
504.27,and yet their willingness to do this. 
507.48,"Right, I think of handrails and walking on handrails "
509.79,"or skateboarding on handrails as a potential hazard, "
512.25,and yet some of the incredible proficiency 
515.43,that some of the people there including yourself had. 
517.53,"So, like many people, I was drawn to your practice "
520.077,"and your work initially through a wide-eyed, ""Wow."" "
523.32,"You know, they're doing some incredible stuff "
524.97,"on natural objects, "
526.32,much as skateboarders or parkour folks do. 
529.14,"But over the years, we've been in communication "
532.2,and I've come to realize that you're a true intellectual 
535.65,of the topic of movement. 
537.36,And I define it intellectual 
538.65,as somebody who can understand a topic 
540.69,"at multiple levels of granularity, "
542.94,"detail, general, specific, connections, et cetera. "
546.57,"So, to start off, "
550.11,could you share with us your conception 
553.29,of this idea of movement? 
555.72,"You know, obviously movement "
557.88,"involves translation through space, "
560.85,"but when you talk about a movement practice, "
563.91,what are you really thinking about? 
565.74,What are we talking about 
566.82,when we talk about a movement practice? 
570.63,- It's a big question. 
574.08,"I somehow left the definition, "
578.88,the very tight definition of it out for myself 
583.89,because I felt it was starting to constrict me 
586.41,and be around me 
587.243,and I let the practice itself really define it. 
591.48,But I think part of our sense of everything 
595.95,is actually a sense of movement 
598.35,and then the stillness in the background of that. 
602.37,"So, for me, this is the entity that I refer to as movement, "
606.57,"and using that perspective for self-evolution development, "
612.84,"of course, the physical side, "
614.61,"but also movement of emotions, "
616.35,"movement of thoughts, and any other movement streams. "
621.81,And by switching these layers 
624.21,"and examining it from different places, "
626.25,you get a better and better sense of it. 
629.85,I think the visuals nowadays and media 
632.58,are what defines for people in the beginning things. 
636.24,"And then little by little with experience, "
638.1,"they can dive deeper, which is good. "
640.26,"There is some aspect, sexy aspect or not so sexy aspect, "
645.09,and then you pull on it and you start to examine 
648.15,"and dive deeper, and then you receive the gift of it, "
653.79,finding out more. 
656.01,- I heard you say once 
656.97,"that we are not just a brain with a body, "
659.19,"but we are a body with a brain, "
662.07,which I absolutely love because as a student 
665.28,"and a researcher of the nervous system, "
667.41,"I never think about the brain as its own isolated thing, "
670.77,I think about the nervous system 
671.603,and the fact that the brain and the spinal cord 
673.83,"are connected to the body, "
674.663,"and the body is connected to this, to the brain. "
677.787,"And in every direction, "
679.29,it's everything truly is connected 
681.99,"at the physical level, physiological level. "
685.02,Could you just share for a moment 
686.82,how you think about this body-brain relationship 
689.46,"in terms of you mentioned movement of emotions, "
694.35,"movement of the body, "
695.58,that you can't really separate the two. 
697.92,"And for the typical person who's listening to this, "
700.98,they might not immediately understand what that means. 
704.07,"Maybe it's something that has to be experienced, "
706.02,but when we think about the body and the brain 
709.62,"and the whole thing working as one cohesive whole, "
712.44,what does that mean to you? 
714.059,"Or put simply, "
715.86,when you do a movement practice what are you focusing on? 
719.82,Are you focusing on the movement of your limbs? 
722.04,"I have to imagine that's true, "
723.18,but are you also focusing on how that makes you feel 
725.58,or how your feelings make you move? 
729.0,"- Okay, okay, so some thoughts, "
734.01,I will try not to answer any of your questions 
736.92,"during this interview, "
738.0,but I will definitely give some thoughts 
740.43,and then we can play with it. 
745.71,I think these definitions 
747.84,"and, in general, the limitation of words "
750.87,ends up creating 
753.9,some kind of a corruptive process. 
756.987,"You know, words corrupt us and corrupt our understanding. "
761.91,"So, I think the brain-body, "
763.44,this Cartesian state of mind and thinking 
767.82,"brought a lot of good, but also brought a lot of problems. "
772.11,"And movement, for me, "
773.49,is the entity that ties everything together. 
776.52,"It's the magic, it's the thoughts anima, "
780.231,it's when the coin spins 
783.0,and you see both sides appear at the same time. 
786.27,It's a beautiful analogy 
787.65,"from a friend of mine, Dr. Rasmus Olme. "
792.33,"So, the mind and body are one of those pairs, "
796.53,"and I call it the movement/body/mind system, "
799.5,"so it's when it's integrated, it's in motion. "
803.7,"There is also a stillness that appears there, of course, "
806.34,"and without it there can be no motion, "
808.86,but maybe that is a very good way 
813.87,to start to think of things. 
815.34,"There is no really pure mental processes, "
818.25,cognitive processes. 
819.36,"There is no pure physical processes, "
822.3,"everything touches everything, "
824.31,"there is a wholeness, and that wholeness is in motion. "
830.43,"Yeah, the movement practice takes these beats "
833.91,and examined them. 
834.9,"And here is a pragmatic thing, "
838.23,"the scientist, the cerebral thinking about movement, "
843.27,this is important. 
845.76,"The emotional side coloring, "
849.93,feeling the colors and the textures of motion. 
852.51,A lot of people who are involved with a movement practice 
855.03,"never end up feeling motions, "
857.43,really focusing on how it makes you feel 
859.89,or how it feels itself. 
861.99,"And then the actual movement, the action, "
864.54,"so, it's action, emotion, and thought. "
867.51,And those are three streams of movement 
869.73,and they interlay together 
871.08,into this kind of a braided experience 
875.91,and whole experience. 
877.017,And I try to bring all these aspects into my practice 
880.322,and the way that I live my life. 
883.23,- I think most people who embark on a movement practice 
888.45,"will first want to know which movements to do, right? "
892.56,"Squats, planks, push-ups, "
896.91,"pirouettes, right? "
898.56,"Pick your movement, it could be any movement. "
901.32,Are there any sort of just basic entry points 
905.88,that you believe everybody should walk through 
909.21,as they embrace a movement practice the first time 
911.64,and maybe even every time they do a movement practice? 
914.4,"I mean, earlier today I had the great privilege "
917.67,"of being guided through a long series of movement practices, "
921.54,"and yet, the first practice we did involve, "
923.91,"at first anyway, stillness not movement. "
927.33,"So, if you would, could you inform us how people "
931.65,should think about approaching a movement practice? 
934.98,What is the first layer of any good movement practice? 
940.11,"- So, you touched the word movement, "
942.06,and it's important for me to separate it 
944.46,from the word Movement with a capital M. 
948.75,Movements are the containers 
950.88,"and movement is the content, "
953.49,and the content cannot be carried 
956.04,in any way without containers. 
958.53,"So, the first entry point is to choose containers, "
961.8,and then the second thing to make sure 
963.87,is to put specific content into those containers 
968.49,and then enjoy them. 
970.53,I tell people that it's like a cup of water 
972.99,and you're being handed that cup of water. 
974.67,And nowadays very often people will start to chew on the cup 
979.5,"instead of drinking the water, "
980.94,making it yours and discard the cup. 
983.46,"And then, maybe later you want to have bone broth or soup "
986.58,"so you use a different container, a bowl. "
989.43,"So, a movement practice to start can start from anywhere, "
992.52,"it's a rhizome, it's an open system, "
996.36,"it has no center, it's decentralized, "
998.73,"and it can be approached from anywhere, "
1000.8,and that's its magic and that's the benefit of it. 
1005.39,"Some people find the body a good entry point, "
1009.53,some people don't even enter from the body. 
1013.52,Sometimes you can enter from other perspectives 
1015.8,"and then inside the body, "
1017.06,"for example, where should we enter? "
1019.34,"If we decided to take the body approach, "
1021.8,"the spine can be a nice decision, "
1023.6,but some will choose just the pelvis. 
1026.72,Any one of those points are valid. 
1029.51,"And then, playfulness can be an entry point, "
1031.97,"an attribute, and this is so open. "
1035.06,"So, I don't want to limit people and limit their minds "
1039.65,"in the way that they engage with the practice, "
1041.57,but I also want to encourage the self-inquiry. 
1047.03,"Am I doing movements practice, "
1049.37,or am I doing a movement practice? 
1052.22,"- So, could you help me distinguish the two "
1054.05,a little bit further? 
1054.92,I think I understand the difference 
1056.12,between a sort of the noun versus the verbs. 
1059.06,And in some ways here we are dealing with the challenge 
1062.72,of the barriers that language present 
1065.78,"to something that's physical, right? "
1067.04,"I mean, indeed, there may not be a... "
1071.51,I have to assume 
1072.343,there is no perfect verbal language for movement. 
1075.56,There are certain movements that defy language. 
1077.63,I could say somebody jumped at a particular trajectory 
1081.14,"at a particular speed and moved this limb and that limb, "
1083.48,but by fractionating it something is most definitely lost. 
1088.79,"So, if someone wanted to, let's say, get in better touch "
1092.48,"with their body, in quotes, "
1094.1,"in order to explore the infinite space that is movement, "
1099.59,how might they begin to approach that? 
1101.6,"Is it does it begin with an awareness, "
1103.85,"with practice, or both? "
1105.92,- It begins with education. 
1107.067,"You know, that's probably the most stable point of entry, "
1111.59,awareness to some something as a concept 
1114.548,"that it is a concept, that there is validity, "
1118.52,or because sometimes people look for that 
1121.46,"to looking at this entity, this open entity. "
1125.66,And that's part of the reason why answering questions 
1129.38,is not something I can do 
1133.61,or even attempt to do. 
1135.56,"I believe in the power of the non-complete process, "
1139.88,"like making this table, "
1143.0,"but living something undone, "
1145.85,"not perfecting the product, why? "
1148.34,Because it offers some kind of a dynamic nature of evolution 
1151.76,that naturally unravels from it. 
1156.74,"Almost like sometimes I do it, "
1159.74,I count reps and I'll only count to nine 
1163.91,'cause it tends to leave people in the count 
1166.88,and it keeps going instead of giving them the 
10.,
1169.79,- Everyone wants to end on 
10.,[laughs] 
1171.44,"- Yeah, which is because of the decimal system, et cetera. "
1176.0,"So, all kinds of things like that is also important "
1180.14,"with the movement idea is to discuss, "
1182.78,"to examine, to look, to taste, to try, "
1186.05,but then also not to try to capture 
1187.85,because if you like the invisible loop of Hoffstadt. 
1191.6,"If you look at it too closely, it's gone, "
1194.51,"but if you look away, "
1196.19,it functions and exists just like us very powerfully 
1199.67,and obviously gives us the experiences that we have. 
1204.77,"So, when people enter movement practice, "
1207.83,"it is about education, "
1209.75,bringing some awareness to the fact that they are living 
1213.62,"in a body, that they are living in motion, "
1216.59,"that their mind is a type of movement, "
1219.47,that their life is a type of movement. 
1222.26,Bringing attention to the movement of the emotions as well. 
1226.37,Bringing just attention to the fact 
1228.32,that things are in motion. 
1230.81,"The Heraclitus panta rhei, all in flux, "
1237.38,nothing stops besides something that is the background of it 
1242.66,"and allows it to express, "
1244.16,and this is the beauty of things. 
1246.23,And this for me is the movement practice 
1248.953,is this examination and bringing this awareness into things. 
1252.68,"As we sit now here, I'm also aware of my body, "
1258.53,"I'm also aware of the way that things make me feel, "
1261.14,the way that your face is communicating to me. 
1263.48,And I'm not just in some limited 
1268.7,"and very verbal, overly verbal state "
1271.37,because it misses a lot of the beautiful flux. 
1275.39,"- I'm going to inject some or project some ideas, "
1278.96,"and perhaps you would tell me if they're ridiculous, "
1283.67,"potentially useful, or useful. "
1286.4,As I understand what we're talking about now 
1289.13,and what we've discussed earlier is that movement 
1292.1,can and should be incorporated into one's entire life. 
1296.03,I've even heard you say 
1296.863,"that even before getting out of bed in the morning, "
1298.73,"one can experience movement, "
1300.86,and it doesn't necessarily have to be of the intimate kind 
1303.17,"with somebody else, it's it can be paying attention "
1306.53,"to the rhythm of one's breath, "
1307.91,or how you get out of the bed. 
1309.29,"Or actually, in anticipation of you arriving here today, "
1312.41,I noticed that as I was going up and down the stairs 
1314.454,"in this house, that I was injecting "
1318.92,a little bit of playfulness 
1320.03,"in the way that I might have many, many decades ago, "
1322.46,but haven't for a very long time. 
1324.83,And I asked myself whether or not 
1327.5,that's what Ido is referring to 
1329.72,when he talks about threading this body awareness 
1332.75,throughout the day. 
1333.98,"As opposed to, but of course not exclusive "
1336.68,from just saying I have 
45,"minutes, "
1339.14,I'm going to do movement practice 
1341.09,before I shower and have some dinner. 
1342.92,"Right, I have to imagine both are helpful, "
1344.45,but in terms of moving through the day 
1345.92,"and having bodily awareness, "
1348.86,clearly there are an infinite number of ways 
1350.45,"one could do that, "
1351.283,maybe you could just share a few. 
1352.58,"You mentioned, I mean, one could pay attention "
1355.07,"to their breath, could pay attention to posture. "
1357.92,And this notion of play is a very attractive 
1360.62,"or as we say in science, it's a sticky concept, "
1363.11,a concept that kind of draws one in. 
1365.54,"Maybe if you would, could you share with us just some ideas "
1368.36,to get people thinking about 
1369.5,or maybe even incorporating 
1371.15,"movement practice into their day, "
1373.43,and maybe even touch on the potential role 
1376.64,of play or playfulness? 
1378.32,- Okay. 
1381.53,"Yeah, those are some good directions. "
1384.98,I think one thing is this what you call wordlessness. 
1389.141,I have been recommending to people non-verbal experiences 
1394.25,"and the awareness of the body, "
1396.89,"which is not really the awareness of the body, as you know, "
1400.73,not purely or not fully. 
1403.37,The awareness of motion is a very good way to start 
1408.45,to bring awareness to that layer. 
1411.23,And that layer will start to get clarified 
1413.36,"more and more and more, the more you practice. "
1415.157,"And then, it will enable for most people, "
1417.83,"a safe haven away from many states and difficulties, "
1422.0,"and will unlock a lot of potential attributes, "
1427.34,"and strength, and freshness, and a lot of beautiful things. "
1432.53,Really one of the really perspectives 
1435.65,about who we are comes from a person 
1438.98,"who influenced my thinking a lot, "
1440.33,"Moshe Feldenkrais, the late Moshe Feldenkrais. "
1443.03,"And he talks about the body as the core three elements, "
1447.08,"the core nervous system, "
1449.81,"two is the mechanical system of muscle, skeleton, et cetera, "
1455.12,"and the third is the environment, "
1457.28,which is a unique way to look at it. 
1460.22,And he talks about how the nervous system 
1462.11,is both receiving information from the outside 
1466.31,and from the inside. 
1467.27,"And in the first years of life, "
1469.13,"you work a lot on differentiating those, "
1473.42,what is me and what is not me? 
1476.39,"And I think movement, when you feel movement, "
1479.48,you feel the movement of the outside 
1482.24,"that is, of course, arriving to you and receiving this, "
1485.45,and also your own internal movement. 
1487.337,And the same can be said for stillness. 
1490.94,"So, bringing the attention into those layers, "
1494.39,it's a tricky thing. 
1495.56,"It's one of those elusive things to look at, "
1498.83,"but it's definitely of huge benefit to start to train it, "
1502.76,"start to practice it, to feel not our thoughts, "
1507.59,"not necessarily our body, "
1510.47,but to start to recognize 
1512.72,"the dynamic nature, the flux, the motion, "
1515.9,and it occurs in all these layers. 
1518.57,"So, you will need to find it in multiple locations "
1522.86,"before you start to more and more make it your own, "
1527.24,make it really yours. 
1529.64,"How, for example, "
1532.01,"simple, pragmatic things I used to do this, "
1534.266,"I spent some time in Hong Kong, "
1537.169,"I would need to get my practice in, "
1539.48,but I'm really turned off from commercial gyms 
1543.68,and there is not a lot of nature accessible there 
1546.74,so I would just strap on my bag 
1548.9,"and I would walk the streets of Hong Kong, "
1550.91,which are very crowded 
1552.29,and then I would try to avoid touching anyone. 
1555.74,And it would be like two hours 
1557.75,"of just like moving, involved, "
1559.85,"fully involved, fully in my body, "
1561.47,"and experiencing beautiful things, "
1564.38,and enjoying and developing myself as well 
1566.99,"in all kinds of scenarios, "
1568.25,up and down in the escalators and off. 
1571.55,"So, this is an example of a way to practice. "
1576.59,"And then, the way that we are sitting "
1579.35,"like these chairs, for example, "
1581.39,"our chairs are not very dynamic, "
1582.95,"but there is rocking chairs, right? "
1584.48,And this is something I recommend for a lot of kids 
1587.81,"like in schools, I used to rock on the chair, "
1590.93,which is very common. 
1592.294,I'm sure- - I used to put my skateboard 
1593.36,"underneath my chair and roll it back and forth, "
1595.19,and the teacher would tell me to stop. 
1597.59,And I would just slowly little by little 
1599.09,trying to get the most subtle movement I could 
1600.71,without them telling me 
1602.36,"they were going to take it away, or try. "
1604.43,"- Which is probably horrible, horrible advice "
1607.25,and instruction just like sit up straight 
1610.04,and chew with your mouth closed 
1611.81,because they remove a lot of the self-education 
1616.22,and a lot of the self-development 
1617.78,and the practical discoveries that are necessary 
1620.45,and even will damage focus 
1623.42,and thinking processes in some ways. 
1628.88,"So, for example, I would make the chairs even more mobile "
1634.187,"and I would support more motion, "
1636.74,"and then I would be able to bring attention there, "
1639.2,but I would also be able to bring attention away from it 
1642.26,into other things. 
1643.7,"And it keeps refreshing me so I don't become stale, "
1647.78,"the water doesn't stand, "
1649.22,this is the beauty of movement. 
1650.957,"So, you can focus for long periods of time "
1653.36,"and do incredible things with the mind, "
1655.1,"with focus, with awareness, attention. "
1657.68,"And it's like we're skin in the game, "
1660.26,so I'm not talking as some meditator 
1663.02,"and he's describing the act of being very focused, "
1666.65,but then I put a stick on the edge of his fingers 
1669.32,"and I tell him, ""Balance it."" "
1670.52,And everyone can do it for 
10,seconds 
1672.86,"and I tell him, ""Okay, now hold it "
10,"minutes."" "
1675.53,"And you see that the skill has, he has no skin in the game. "
1679.85,"It wasn't developed in various scenarios, "
1682.88,but so there is a delusion that start to develop 
1686.397,and that's how movement keeps me very honest 
1691.19,and humble in the way that I view humility 
1694.67,and in a way that protects me 
1697.76,"and keeps me, yeah, it keeps me fresh. "
1704.51,- I loved the example of moving through the crowded street 
1707.84,with a backpack because of the way 
1709.13,in which it's completely adaptive 
1710.78,to the situation you happened to be in 
1712.91,and highlights the fact that one doesn't need a gym 
1716.48,"or any specific scenario, "
1719.72,although we will certainly touch 
1721.28,on ideal learning circumstances for movement 
1723.83,"and some of the work that you're doing, of course. "
1727.64,"- The less of your own personal practice, "
1730.55,"and understanding, and knowledge you've done, "
1733.61,the more toys you need. 
1736.13,"The more you've really worked on yourself, "
1740.06,the more high-tech you are. 
1741.8,"The more low-tech are your tools, "
1743.81,the more high-tech you are. 
1745.28,And this is the most advanced technology 
1748.76,by far on this planet. 
1750.68,"With all the advancement, it doesn't even start to scratch, "
1753.969,"and you know it, "
1754.82,from the way that we understand the eyes 
1757.58,"all the way to with all the respect to the Boston Robotics, "
1763.1,a 
5-year-old,motion- 
1764.78,"- Yeah, yeah. - Movements. "
1766.94,"Or animal motion with very underdeveloped, "
1770.21,still relatively to us as systems. 
1773.09,"So, important to remind ourselves. "
1777.05,- A lot can be done with the body and gravity 
1780.2,"as I- - Floor, a piece of floor, "
1781.46,"a piece of wall, a corner of a room is a beautiful scenario, "
1785.63,which you can become discover in and play in. 
1790.34,"And, but we are not so developed "
1793.19,so we don't see those options. 
1795.05,"And this is something that I try to stimulate, "
1796.97,and that's why I made it a point to avoid 
1799.79,any of the big sponsorship 
1802.73,and high-tech tools. 
1805.04,And I on point brought a stick 
1808.1,into big conventions 
1810.62,and/or sometimes I use a shirt with holes in it 
1815.633,that just like a used shirt as a point to make 
1818.3,when I'm addressing a crowd to keep things 
1822.535,"where it's important and it's important, "
1826.37,"we are important, and our experience is important. "
1830.12,"And we have to be very careful, "
1832.58,"these habits and these directions, "
1836.42,"they come from many times good intention, "
1838.76,"but they are the devil many times, "
1842.15,"they turn into the devil, "
1843.65,just like our technology nowadays 
1846.2,"and what is happening with people and with depression, "
1848.99,"with meaning, meaninglessness, "
1853.16,"also with the body in various perspectives, "
1855.47,or even I will also flip it into high performance sports 
1860.18,and their price. 
1862.52,"Because for me, this is not a movement practice, "
1864.71,it erases the person in the center of it. 
1867.83,And then came places like skateboarding or break dancing 
1872.9,where somebody with a disability 
1875.27,"becomes the best in the world, "
1877.01,"turns it into the biggest advantage, "
1879.2,"but you would never be accepted into gymnastics class, "
1882.38,and I love that. 
1884.15,And that change 
1885.83,"to place change in the center, it's important. "
1891.2,"- You touched on mention of a few sports, "
1894.95,"maybe it was Charles Poliquin, "
1896.18,or maybe it was another trainer that I heard once say 
1900.23,"that, ""For kids, one of the worst things they can do "
1904.34,"is overspecialize in a particular sport."" "
1907.073,The idea being that it leads to improvements in performance 
1911.57,"in a very narrow domain, "
1912.95,but they raised the idea 
1916.34,that it could perhaps also constrains 
1918.92,"the development of the nervous system, "
1920.21,"such that certain emotional states, "
1922.686,certain intellectual abilities will forever be shut off 
1926.3,because of the intense plasticity that occurs early in life. 
1930.14,"The more I learn from you, "
1931.7,the more I'm thinking that that statement 
1933.29,really should be extended to all of life. 
1935.39,And I love to remind people 
1938.15,"because I started off as a developmental neurobiologist, "
1940.4,"that development doesn't start and end, "
1942.29,you don't have childhood and adulthood. 
1944.18,Our life is one long developmental arc 
1945.95,"from birth until death, however long that might be. "
1948.71,"So, if one is going to be anti-specialist, "
1952.82,"maybe even we call that a generalist, "
1955.7,what does that look like? 
1956.69,What are the different domains of movement practice? 
1959.63,"And as I asked this, I realized I am in serious danger "
1964.76,of fractionating movement into a list of words 
1968.3,"like strength, and speed, and explosiveness, and suppleness, "
1972.083,a word that I've heard you use before. 
1974.48,"And yet, I think for most people "
1975.53,"because we think in words, often, "
1979.85,some of those categories can be useful. 
1981.56,"So, let's say I was going to embark on a movement practice "
1983.63,or a child was going to embark on a movement practice 
1986.51,and either throughout the day 
1988.4,"or for a dedicated period of time, "
1990.92,what are the sorts of categories of movement 
1992.78,"that I might want to think about, "
1994.79,"ballistic movement, smooth movement? "
1997.1,Maybe you could just enrich us 
1999.08,with some of the landscape around that. 
2001.93,"- Okay, first I'll address the first part "
2004.96,that you mentioned. 
2006.67,And I've learned from you about certain changes 
2011.35,in the way that things develop later in life 
2015.31,versus earlier in life. 
2016.99,"And you're right, it is something "
2018.55,that Charles Poliquin also mentioned 
2020.137,"and I learned from back in the day as well from him, "
2024.1,"which can seem dark a bit and kind of hopeless, "
2027.85,but then you should go beyond that. 
2033.82,One thing that does seem to appear 
2039.22,for me when I look around 
2041.71,is these the concepts of unique postures. 
2048.16,"And I think this is true for postures of thought, "
2052.27,"emotional postures, and movement postures. "
2056.14,"Truly, earlier in life, "
2058.78,we are creating these unique postures 
2062.77,and they get into these drawers 
2066.25,or like language letters. 
2069.91,"Later in life, the process moves more "
2073.66,towards integration of these unique postures 
2076.39,into all different organizations. 
2079.18,The beauty of it is that you can use very few postures 
2081.88,"to create many possibilities, "
2084.28,just like a lib needs a search for a language 
2087.294,"that contain one symbol only versus two, "
2092.14,which he discovered. 
2096.186,"And this is something that is often seen, "
2101.23,like you take someone who moves in a certain way 
2104.95,"and you teach them all these new sports or techniques, "
2108.25,"but essentially if you look deeply and you're sensitive, "
2111.52,you see it's the same postures 
2114.07,"that he will have to work with till the end of his life, "
2118.06,the same thinking postures. 
2120.61,"And this is really problematic, "
2124.3,where we are not freeing 
2128.05,"the mind beyond this, "
2133.99,"how would I say, a scaffolding of thinking "
2137.86,and we are actually letting go of the content. 
2140.35,We get more and more focused 
2143.26,on the way of thinking 
2148.45,"versus the thinking itself, "
2150.34,"or habitual ways and forms of thinking, "
2154.63,"associated thinking, et cetera. "
2157.27,"And emotionally the same, "
2158.65,we are constructing these emotional postures 
2161.14,and then we have to go through the rest of our lives 
2163.36,working with that. 
2165.04,"So, this is the dark side, right? "
2167.62,"But of course, there are always possibilities, "
2171.91,"both I think invading this early system, "
2176.59,"to some extent, even if it's "
"5%,",or 
"7%,","or whatever percent, "
2181.99,and also on the freeing yourself 
2184.93,of going beyond all postures period. 
2188.95,"Working with the postures you have, "
2190.96,but towards a postureless way of doing things. 
2195.34,"So, this is something interesting to work "
2198.4,"when people work with movements, "
2200.47,but finally are able to go into movement 
2204.52,"and this magic starts to happen, "
2206.26,"and then the techniques fall apart and something appears, "
2211.63,"and it's a face change, it's a transformation, "
2217.54,it's a binary moment. 
2219.4,"There is a jump there for sure, "
2220.708,"and it's very rare to see both in thinking, and emotionally, "
2225.67,"and other ways, we have many names for it. "
2228.337,And some talk about enlightenment 
2230.65,and some talk about all kinds of processes related to it. 
2233.347,And I think most of them 
2234.94,"are shadows of the sun, "
2238.69,but it's not the sun itself really. 
2241.93,"And then, talking about ways of thinking about movement, "
2245.56,this is where I use something I called my slice and dice 
2250.0,"because of the problem of using words, "
2252.28,"and definitions, and categories, "
2253.81,I try to create a lot of them 
2256.69,"and I write them on the paper and then I crumble them, "
2260.77,"throw them into the bin, and I keep doing it all my life. "
2264.91,The writing them down and the geeking on it 
2267.94,"is very important, also very important to let it go. "
2272.26,"I tell people what you forgot is not the same, "
2277.09,forgetting is not the same as never knowing it. 
2279.97,"The crumbling and throwing away is a form of forgetting, "
2283.45,but it leaves some kind of a homeopathic 
2288.4,trace behind. 
2290.05,"So, let's take some slice and dice, "
2292.75,and try to look at it. 
2294.49,"Here is a physical one, contraction, relaxation. "
2300.46,"That's a spectrum, "
2301.9,and pretty much everything falls on this spectrum. 
2304.87,"Also, in terms of analyzing a person or yourself, "
2308.47,you can tell me if you feel closer to this side 
2311.8,"or closer to that side, "
2313.93,and then it allows you to examine your practices. 
2316.24,How many of the practices are moving you towards balance 
2320.98,and how many are it's your addiction 
2323.05,of just doing what you're good at versus what you need? 
2327.91,"Here is another example, physical culture. "
2331.24,"So, we have the dense realm "
2333.94,working with internal concepts 
2337.72,"and expressing them, abstract concepts, expression. "
2343.39,"Second perspective, the Marshall concept, "
2346.0,"but not in the sense of just fighting, "
2347.83,"but also partnering, working with another person, "
2351.803,a dynamic entity that is communicating with you. 
2355.42,"The third one is I call the elements, "
2357.46,working with the environment. 
2361.51,"The next one is a somatic one, is the internal practice. "
2365.86,"And of course, there are all gray zones, "
2367.93,"and another one is object manipulatory, "
2371.29,"which you can think of it also as the environment, "
2373.15,"but it's more small objects, "
2375.43,"heavy objects, many objects, few objects. "
2378.04,"And then you can look at this way of thinking, "
2380.71,"and you can say, ""Oh, I have many of my practices "
2383.74,"in this direction, but not,"" "
2385.39,and you can draw it for yourself. 
2387.79,"So, that's another perspective, "
2389.41,and this way I use dozens of perspectives. 
2393.1,"And with the years, "
2395.14,"it gives people a sense of where they want to go, "
2397.72,"how they want to do it, "
2398.95,and what they need to address 
2400.48,"versus what they like to address, et cetera. "
2402.91,Is it helpful? 
2403.743,"- Very helpful, those different bins are very helpful. "
2408.16,I really appreciate that you mentioned 
2410.26,that people will often practice what they're good at 
2412.93,as opposed to what they need. 
2414.7,"In gym culture, we refer to this "
2418.45,"as the guy that always skips leg day type of person, right? "
2422.14,"You know, big upper body, skinny legs, "
2423.91,or you you'll see people 
2425.35,that have these enormous thick torsos 
2427.36,"and they're bench pressing all day, "
2428.65,but they clearly need to pull on an object 
2431.56,"every once in a while to create some balance, "
2433.42,"but they don't do it because they, for whatever reason, "
2437.68,they have an obsession with moving 
2439.54,"greater and greater poundage or something like that, "
2442.93,which in certain sports like power lifting 
2445.81,"or aesthetics aren't the goal, "
2447.61,and it's simply to push more weight off one's chest 
2449.86,that you could imagine 
2450.693,that there's something beneficial there. 
2452.26,"However, I think that it's really important "
2455.92,"in intellectual endeavors and in movement endeavors, "
2459.97,"if I understand correctly, "
2460.96,to bring oneself to a place of real challenge 
2463.9,on a regular basis. 
2465.52,"In fact, earlier today, "
2466.78,I was in a state of constant challenge 
2468.25,'cause it was all new to me. 
2469.96,"And as much as I told myself, ""Beginners' mind, "
2472.48,"beginners' mind, beginners' mind,"" "
2474.04,"it's hard, I confess, to not want to do well, "
2477.25,"to perform well, right? "
2478.51,And I think that's a natural and healthy thing. 
2481.18,"Yet- - Not only natural, "
2482.95,"it is necessary, "
2484.87,but I want you to keep it on that side 
2488.23,and to bring something to balance it. 
2491.35,"If there is not this challenge, the process will not work. "
2495.88,It has to be this scale. 
2497.47,"And you're talking about scales of pain, pleasure, "
2500.26,and this is another scale. 
2502.93,And this discomfort again is necessary 
2506.38,"and should be recognized as, ""I'm in the right place."" "
2509.92,"When it becomes too high and I'm unable to resolve, "
2514.63,"to make any progress, "
2517.81,"I went overboard, but when it's not present, "
2521.74,I don't do nothing here. 
2523.42,"Nothing that I'm truly interested in, "
2525.34,"I'm just gratifying myself, wankery. "
2528.46,"It's in essence, "
2533.11,"it's not about searching for the discomfort, "
2536.68,but it's a marker. 
2539.2,And I think the question 
2543.76,should be who am I serving? 
2546.64,"'Cause people do not serve themselves, in essence, "
2551.02,"they serve part, parts of it, "
2553.941,some kind of a fraction of themselves. 
2557.83,"And this separation of oneself from oneself, "
2561.61,"and this is also a result of the practice, a good practice. "
2567.37,I think maybe the biggest gift I received 
2570.58,from the practice is I can say 
2574.21,"although it will take maybe a certain context, "
2578.17,I am not my friend. 
2581.53,"At times I am, "
2582.91,but many times I am not my friend. 
2585.13,"And by creating this separation, "
2587.2,I can assume a certain stability 
2590.56,in the face of everything 
2593.02,"all the way up to our own mortality and death, "
2596.35,"which is, and maybe beyond, who knows? "
2600.58,"- Yeah, it was a striking moment for me earlier today "
2604.21,when I was really challenged 
2605.8,"with one of the practices we were doing, "
2608.98,"and you said, ""This is exactly what I experienced "
2612.37,"this morning, Andrew,"" that's what you said. "
2615.19,And I couldn't imagine that you were having challenges 
2617.44,doing what I was attempting to do. 
2618.97,"And of course, you were, "
2619.803,and I believe what you were referring to 
2621.25,is that you had put yourself at that edge 
2623.77,"earlier in the day in which you were making failures, "
2626.89,you were failing to execute 
2628.63,the way that you were attempting to execute movement. 
2631.93,I should just to inject some neuroscience 
2634.39,"and neuroplasticity there, I can't help myself, "
2636.76,it is what I do after all. 
2639.07,There are beautiful data in animals and humans 
2641.86,showing that in the seconds and minutes 
2645.16,"after a failed attempt at a motor execution of something, "
2649.21,the forebrain is in a heightened state of focus. 
2651.73,"And when you hear it, suddenly makes perfect sense, "
2654.46,"of course, why would the nervous system change "
2656.71,unless it got a cue to change? 
2658.9,"And the cue almost always comes in the form of frustration, "
2663.31,"the [imitates buzzer] or as we said earlier, nah, "
2666.73,the nah signal [Ido laughing] 
2668.35,is the one that preps you to extract more learning 
2671.92,from the subsequent trials. 
2673.69,"And yet, for a lot of people, "
2675.52,"they feel that ugh, that failure to execute, "
2678.46,or even to approximate execution 
2682.12,"and they feel and experience that ah negative signal, "
2686.5,"and they lean out of the practice, "
2689.02,they start to depart either mentally or physically or both. 
2692.59,And if there's anything I think that perhaps we can offer 
2695.92,is this understanding that that edge 
2697.51,as some people call it 
2698.38,"or that failures aren't just necessary, "
2701.23,"they are part of the learning process, "
2703.75,they are the entry gate to neuroplasticity. 
2707.71,"- Yes, contextualizing or recontextualizing "
2712.3,that sensation is something I work a lot with 
2715.1,and I just remind people 
2716.83,"and I also reminded to myself, "
2719.02,and if it wasn't difficult 
2720.67,"and we didn't need to redo it again and again, "
2723.7,"we wouldn't be again on this correct scale, "
2727.27,which is dynamic and moving just like rolling downhill. 
2731.41,"So, there is definitely a necessity to succeed, to orient, "
2735.7,"there is certain aspects that you want to achieve, "
2739.24,but then there is also the letting go of it 
2743.68,and the deambitioning of it. 
2745.94,"And within that tension, "
2749.32,"the plus and the minus comes movement, "
2751.48,and that that's how I did it. 
2752.857,"And again, if I stretch it too far away, "
2755.14,"or if I increase one of them too much, "
2757.227,"then I would have some issues, "
2759.13,but you will with practice 
2761.71,learn to recognize the optimal point of progression. 
2767.14,"Of course, it takes many years "
2769.547,"and a lot of play and exposure to get a sense of it, "
2774.25,regardless of the layer in which it is applied. 
2778.09,"So, I'm sure in your field and in your pursuits, "
2782.26,"you are already aware of it and applying it in your life, "
2786.19,"talking about focus, talking about ways of thinking, "
2789.13,"creativity, et cetera. "
2790.96,But then it's enough that I pull into another perspective 
2794.08,"and you will see that people are specialists, "
2796.45,and then they don't have really the real essence 
2800.562,of the concept. 
2802.15,"It's not theirs, it's applied specifically. "
2805.78,The one who changes all the time 
2808.15,gets the general component 
2809.77,because what appears when everything changes? 
2811.923,That is that new entity. 
2814.45,"Everything changes, something stays. "
2818.11,"That's what we want to get, "
2819.19,this concept and this understanding. 
2822.85,"- I've heard the statement before, "
2824.32,"we are just a meat vehicle, right? "
2826.36,We're just a sack of cells 
2828.46,and it's I truly despise that statement 
2831.52,"because, first of all, "
2832.9,it deprives us of all meaning in of our lives. 
2836.68,And we can go down the route of philosophy 
2840.13,"as to whether or not there's meaning or not, "
2842.26,"but more importantly, it divorces us from the idea "
2845.38,that the body and brain are interconnected 
2847.15,and have at least equal value at any one moment 
2850.99,that they're informing each other. 
2852.19,"Emotions inform movement, movement informs emotions. "
2855.79,"One thing that I've heard you say before, "
2857.223,and I'd really love to hear you embellish on 
2860.98,is this important principle 
2863.23,that human beings are truly unique 
2865.48,in terms of the enormous range of movements 
2868.42,that we can perform. 
2870.67,"And yet, we are excellent, "
2872.41,maybe superior to all other species 
2874.72,at certain types of movement. 
2877.39,"The one that comes to mind is walking, strides, striding. "
2880.81,"So, maybe we could just explore that idea "
2885.52,"because obviously a cheetah is very fast, "
2888.82,the gibbon seems to have a lot of proficiency 
2891.01,"at grabbing and swinging from branches, "
2894.49,but human beings perform an enormous 
2897.4,or can potentially perform an enormous array of movements. 
2899.98,Do you think all human beings 
2901.36,are potentially able to explore 
2904.18,all the different types of movement? 
2907.21,"And if so, how does one approach that? "
2909.7,"So, basically what I'm doing is I'm tabling a concept, "
2913.12,"which is not range of motion, "
2915.43,"right, for the gym rats, discard with range of motion, "
2918.61,I'm talking about the variety of movements. 
2923.86,"- First, it's not important what I think, "
2927.37,"if it's possible or not possible, "
2929.53,"or if it's even possible for you or not possible for you, "
2933.52,"what is important is what you truly want to do, "
2938.59,what you truly are after. 
2940.48,"And it's important for me because many times, "
2942.67,this way of thinking about things is already limited. 
2947.89,I like to say 
2950.71,a man doesn't go to the ocean to empty it with a spoon. 
2955.36,A lot of the types of dressing up of the concepts nowadays 
2960.64,is trying to fit an elephant 
2962.41,"into the hole in the needle, yeah? "
2967.0,"Like for example, the concept of practice, "
2971.17,"and then our lives, as if we have a life. "
2976.84,"We have some kind of a stream of behaviors, "
2981.37,"we have there is an argument of free will, et cetera. "
2985.03,"There is a multiplicity, definitely a man is a legion, "
2989.44,that's the real meaning of that phrase. 
2993.34,"One day you wake up like this, "
2995.83,"I say, ""Andrew, let's meet tomorrow at "
7:,
00,"am,"" "
2998.32,but I don't know who's going to wake up tomorrow. 
3000.57,"And then you send me a text message, "
3003.307,"""Oh, I'm feeling off,"" "
3006.36,right at 
6:,
55,and go back to sleep. 
3009.54,"So, examining that and seeing that "
3012.27,I think frees you up eventually 
3014.19,and start to orient you in a better direction. 
3019.26,"So, what do you want to do and what, "
3022.35,"but in the orientation of also what you need to do, "
3025.53,"what you sense, and what you are developing "
3029.01,"as an evolutionary direction for you, "
3032.85,this is the important bit. 
3035.34,Is it possible for everyone to engage 
3037.38,in certain specific physical movement? 
3039.39,"For example, in Scandinavian countries, "
3041.88,"the squat is not very approachable, "
3047.25,it's very difficult. 
3048.78,They're more built for dragging heavy things 
3051.69,"and also in this climate, I guess it, "
3055.41,it makes less sense to squat 
3057.33,and 'cause you're going to freeze there. 
3059.43,"So, this is and then you see the squat in warm climates "
3063.87,and it's like so open and accessible. 
3067.05,"They're very good deadlifters usually, "
3070.83,not good squatters and the- 
3073.082,- They want to get away from the ground. 
3074.65,"- Yeah, the shallow hip socket, which allows one activity, "
3078.81,but then the stability of the deep hip socket 
3081.21,"architecture of the hip, "
3084.6,"the femur heads, the Q angles, the shapes, et cetera. "
3088.38,"So, we are all unique and there are certain elements, "
3091.29,"which like, for example, my squat challenge "
3093.45,is like for most people 
3096.3,"there is something there, but- "
3097.15,- Could you remind people what the squat challenge is? 
3099.72,- The squat was my attempt to bring 
3103.59,"a new, fresh state of mind into the word squat, "
3109.08,"not as a strength element, "
3111.27,but it's a fundamental resting position really. 
3115.59,"Actually, should be one of the most abundant ones, "
3118.05,"we replaced it with sitting, "
3120.93,which is not really doesn't work well 
3122.58,"if you're in a natural environment, "
3124.53,it's not very comfortable 
3125.7,"actually to sit for long periods of time, "
3127.5,rocks and different terrains 
3129.12,"so you end up lying down, standing, and squatting a lot. "
3133.35,"Also, when you're moving low and dynamic, "
3135.63,"like even collecting berries, "
3137.46,the squat is much more dynamic and open. 
3140.91,"And then elimination is happening there, "
3142.98,so it's like it's such a fundamental thing 
3144.72,and we totally eliminated it. 
3146.88,"We eliminated many other things, "
3148.53,"overhead movements, behind the back, "
3152.04,all kinds of back realm 
3154.08,what I call the back realm is totally absent 
3156.78,in people's awareness. 
3159.21,"So, that was my attempt to bring it back into people, "
3161.43,and I recommended to in order 
3164.34,"to really get the transformation, "
3167.37,going to accumulate 
30,"minutes a day in the squat position, "
3172.11,"unloaded, just resting down, "
3173.76,"not correct, not erect, many people make this mistake, "
3176.7,they didn't read through the whole thing. 
3178.74,It's just resting down there. 
3180.45,"And of course, you have to be mindful of dosages. "
3183.27,Some people will get hurt if they try to do it too quickly 
3186.69,so they might need a buildup process towards it. 
3189.06,"And also, I'm not talking about "
30,"minutes straight, "
3193.11,but accumulation throughout the day. 
3195.39,"And this does a lot of good for digestive problems, "
3198.69,"for lower back pain, for hip pains, for knees, "
3202.59,and generally for aging 
3204.69,because it's basically folding your body 
3208.74,in the most basic way. 
3210.0,Are you folding your body? 
3211.05,"If you're not folding your body, "
3212.82,you will lose the foldability of your body. 
3215.13,And this is probably the easiest 
3218.07,and the most abundant way to fold the body. 
3221.34,"So, but this is an example of something "
3224.7,"that can be very useful with many, many people, "
3227.49,but there will always be unique individuals 
3230.64,which needs something else. 
3232.62,And there are benefits 
3236.85,in examining things 
3238.89,"and also there are benefits in getting hurt, "
3242.34,"which is not often discussed, especially not in these parts. "
3245.97,"So, I'm one of the only ones as a teacher "
3250.53,"that says, ""I injured many of my students."" "
3254.07,"And if I did not do that, "
3255.66,I would be totally useless for them as well. 
3259.98,"That totally safe system has nothing to offer, "
3264.63,practically nothing is totally safe. 
3266.67,"And we can, of course, we don't approach it "
3268.86,"with a ballsy or machoistic thing, "
3271.32,but we are aware that sometimes 
3273.12,we have to go beyond the boundaries 
3274.74,and hopefully those would be the small injuries 
3277.44,that will help us avoid the big injuries. 
3280.05,"But if you try to avoid the small injuries, "
3281.85,maybe you'll get those big injuries in there. 
3284.73,"So, examining which types and forms of movement, "
3288.69,"the location of the body, speed of execution, "
3293.19,"the type of organization of the body, "
3295.65,which is a whole thing that we can discuss. 
3299.55,All of this is up for the grabs 
3301.65,and something that we have to create 
3303.51,"individual relationship with, "
3306.42,"hopefully with good guidance, "
3308.25,"where we can get the right scenarios, "
3312.27,"a facilitator of good scenarios for our learning, "
3315.12,which is what I try to do. 
3316.83,"And less of a technical state of mind, "
3318.69,"do this ABC or, yeah, like chunking "
3322.74,what I really dislike from a long time 
3325.885,"is like many people they tell me, "
3328.747,"""Have you met this guy? "
3330.27,He's an amazing teacher 
3331.53,because he chunked the process into these bits 
3334.14,"and not even in the correct places to chunk,"" "
3336.099,"it was like and it doesn't offer, "
3338.64,"it locks us, this state of mind. "
3340.95,"I talk about the chemistry model, "
3343.05,"I call it my chemistry model where an atom, "
3346.47,"a molecule, and then a compound is conceptualized "
3349.38,versus just chunking. 
3350.97,"So, there is an actual evolution "
3353.13,like I call it also sketch learning. 
3356.58,"I'm not going to try to draw you, "
3358.74,"if I know anything about art and drawing, "
3361.32,I'm going to start by capturing something very rough. 
3364.32,"And I need to practice that first, that dynamic entity, "
3368.01,"before I go into the rendering and the shading, et cetera. "
3373.08,"So, the same way to learn things, "
3375.33,"so big picture, the small details. "
3378.63,"And unlike many of my teachers in that I ran into, "
3382.32,"and I say, with the greatest respect "
3385.14,"because I don't know who taught me more, "
3386.76,"my good teachers or my worst teachers, "
3390.15,but some of them just teach from the small details 
3392.91,into a big picture that never arrives. 
3395.67,- Given that humans can generate such a broad array 
3399.45,"of types of movement, "
3400.47,"run, jump, duck, squat, leap, "
3403.05,and all these types of movements. 
3405.75,Do you think there's value in observing the movements 
3408.06,of other animal species? 
3409.32,I know I certainly enjoy watching other animals move. 
3414.87,"I think the most, "
3415.74,one of the more spectacular animal facts 
3419.19,"that was shared with me is when I was a graduate student, "
3422.1,someone down the hall was working on the little pedals 
3425.28,"of the chameleon, which can walk up walls. "
3429.36,And it was a great mystery 
3430.77,"as to whether or not they were suction, "
3432.45,"but turns out they can do it in a vacuum, "
3433.89,so it's not suction. 
3435.06,Whether or not there was some sticky substance 
3436.65,"and it turned out, I don't know, "
3438.69,I feel compelled to share this with you 
3440.04,so I'm going to do it because I have a feeling 
3441.87,"it will lead us to an insight of some sort, "
3444.48,that those little tiny pedals are so thin 
3447.33,and so close together that the chameleon 
3450.81,actually sticks to the wall 
3452.07,"by what are called van der Waals forces, "
3454.47,"meaning it's a very weak molecular force, "
3456.57,but strong enough to stick to the wall 
3458.61,because they are actually exchanging molecules 
3460.89,with the surface they're on. 
3462.42,"- Wow. - So, obviously "
3464.31,"we can't do that, and yet I spent hours, "
3468.78,"because they were in the lab next door, "
3470.28,watching videos of these little chameleon walk 
3473.13,and the articulation of these feet is incredible 
3476.73,because they're literally rolling those little pedals along 
3479.7,in a way that it kind of defies 
3482.07,anything else I've ever seen. 
3484.38,"I told myself this was useful, "
3486.63,"A, because I thought it was interesting, "
3487.95,"but, B, because I never really thought about "
3490.53,how I articulate my foot. 
3492.09,I've thought about being a heel striker 
3493.53,or a toe striker when I run 
3494.91,and no one can tell me which one I'm supposed to be. 
3497.157,"And maybe you can tell me, [Ido laughing] "
3498.72,"but the point is, or I suppose the question is, "
3503.73,do you think there's value in observing 
3505.47,the extremes of animal kingdom movement 
3508.53,as a way to inform the play space 
3510.63,and the exploration space 
3511.92,of our own human movement practice? 
3515.7,- I think so. 
3516.533,"I think, first, it's inspiring, "
3521.58,"it opens up, but I will take it away "
3524.19,from the romantic point of view. 
3527.37,And I would offer another way 
3528.87,to examine all these movements exist in us 
3534.12,"in ways, in certain ways. "
3536.25,"Like the work of Gracovetsky on the spine, "
3539.407,"""The Spinal Engine"", "
3541.26,and to see how these old ways 
3546.48,of moving even all the way up to exoskeletons 
3549.24,"and like primary, very ancient "
3553.68,or even single cell things are still within us 
3557.04,to a certain extent. 
3557.873,"And then, of course, this gets developed "
3562.41,like the Darwinian state of mind 
3565.62,got stuck for many years on the survival of the fetus. 
3570.36,"But actually, I believe, "
3572.22,I always believed and I saw some information 
3575.46,"about it lately that mutation is the heart of the model, "
3579.39,not survival of the fittest. 
3581.19,"- Yeah, people often hear the word mutation "
3583.26,"and they think, ""Oh, mutations are bad."" "
3585.33,There are maladaptive mutations 
3587.94,"and then there are adaptive mutations, for sure. "
3590.67,"- And then, this places the word change in the heart of it, "
3594.51,"what it wants to do, change. "
3598.2,"So, it does not want to become better, "
3602.52,there is an inherent change in it. 
3607.02,"And then, of course, they become better at X, Y, Z, "
3610.17,fittest is the secondary perspective 
3613.77,"that arrives in relation to certain things, "
3615.81,"but there is still a stronger, "
3617.28,more ancient driving force into the process. 
3620.85,"So, for me, this is cool to see these animals "
3624.48,"take it all the way to this extreme, "
3626.73,but it's also still reflecting within us. 
3629.67,"So, I love to do, like for example, "
3631.56,"I introduce with people spinal waves, "
3634.5,"and by bringing these waves into the body, "
3637.53,sometimes you get weird experiences like emotional releases 
3642.45,"and sometimes, and other times "
3645.3,it can become an incredible tool to help an athlete 
3648.78,which specialized and reach the top of the top. 
3651.81,"And then, you defrag his system a little bit "
3654.99,and offer him some freshness and some segmental movement. 
3659.4,"And first you fuck him up, "
3661.71,that's usually the case. 
3663.51,"Technically he's off, his coordination is off, "
3665.97,but later the growth will arrive. 
3668.88,"It's a form of playfulness, "
3670.65,it's a form of examining things 
3672.96,regardless of their success or failure. 
3675.39,More understanding that change is important 
3678.42,"and then after that, "
3679.74,we can also look at the more competitive state of mind 
3684.39,"and the more success and failure orientation, "
3688.38,but there is no game without change. 
3690.81,"So, this is the primary one, "
3693.586,"and that's why I say, ""Okay, "
3695.16,"you want to succeed in the tasks like we did earlier, "
3698.13,"but you stayed within the game, to sustain the game, "
3700.68,"the infinite versus finite game perspective."" "
3704.97,"To sustain the game means to continue to change, "
3709.2,"continue to transform, "
3711.78,and then to win the game sometimes mean game over. 
3717.21,"So, it's like, yeah, within that tension "
3719.91,"I think it's beautiful to play, and to exist, and to be. "
3724.53,- You mentioned something that for me 
3726.15,is an incredibly important concept 
3728.76,"for a couple of reasons, "
3729.69,and you mentioned these spinal waves. 
3731.64,"Right, I have to assume that's taking the torso for us, "
3735.03,"you know, movement morons "
3737.22,that I'll just refer to in coarse terms of thoracic spine. 
3741.0,"So, I mean, I will stay away from the technical anatomy "
3743.4,and the torso and creating movement 
3745.83,either side to side undulation 
3748.95,or arching and extension of the spine. 
3752.22,"- Yeah, dorsal, ventral, side to side, "
3754.65,or rotational as well as spiraling. 
3759.96,- Have you ever had the experience that of yourself 
3763.17,or other people engaging in those types of movements 
3765.33,and experiencing particular categories of emotions? 
3768.75,"And I have a particular reason for asking this, "
3770.46,"there's no right or wrong answer, of course, "
3771.93,but I'm just curious whether or not movement 
3774.57,"of let's call it the core of the body, "
3776.64,things close to the midline 
3777.96,as opposed to far away from the midline like the digits far. 
3781.23,"Is there any, "
3782.672,do you have any evidence that that can evoke 
3784.5,a certain category of emotional states? 
3787.95,"- Evidence, I have none, "
3789.3,but I have experience and I have some thoughts about it. 
3794.4,Ida Rolf is known to have created Rolfing 
3798.99,or structural integration 
3800.22,"said, ""The issues are in the tissues."" "
3803.07,"And around the spine, the spine is us, "
3807.18,"as you know, it's like can take an arm off, a limb, "
3810.12,"but there's been attempts, "
3813.66,"but there is no brainy alone, "
3816.72,"this cerebral thing alone, "
3818.61,the spine and the maybe more parts of n-systems 
3822.24,inside the torso are important. 
3824.01,"So, that's why I like to start from that core entity. "
3826.8,"And then these little fluctuations they create, "
3833.4,"they unblock things, they start to move things. "
3836.82,"And you can avoid, funny enough, "
3839.73,"mobilizing those areas by doing big frame motions, "
3844.62,"and competitive motions, and techniques all your life. "
3848.49,"So, even most yogis, for example, "
3851.22,"they look extremely mobile, "
3853.56,"but then when you're actually going into the small, "
3855.9,"what I call the small frame, "
3857.64,"I borrowed this from Chinese martial arts, "
3860.19,"small frame, big frame. "
3861.57,The big frame is this big changes 
3864.63,of our total body in space posture. 
3868.26,"And then the small frame is barely moving, "
3870.39,but mobilizing the little bits that comprise 
3873.33,the same pretty much posture. 
3875.79,"So, these are very beneficial "
3877.23,and it has totally disappeared from our physical culture. 
3881.73,"When you introduce it back, "
3884.79,"the small frame offers the big frame, "
3887.19,but the big frame doesn't offer the small frame 
3889.41,"because, of course, the small detail come together "
3892.2,into the big picture. 
3893.43,"So, if I want to place my body in a specific position "
3896.13,"and I have all these bits moving well, "
3898.17,I can construct it in whatever way I want. 
3900.84,"But if I just work on the big one, "
3903.9,most chances are I just mobilize certain areas 
3907.44,while other areas are totally held or blocked 
3911.07,and then I'm specialized one more time. 
3914.58,Take me out of this realm and I'll have difficulties. 
3917.91,What will sit there in this stagnation? 
3920.34,"Emotion, material, thoughts, traumas. "
3925.14,That's why people get discharges. 
3929.34,"The body memory is not what we think it is, "
3932.58,"that's how I believe, "
3933.413,"it is stored in a lot everywhere, "
3938.34,and I've had those experiences. 
3940.68,A lot of people have the opposite. 
3942.69,"When a certain emotion is evoked, "
3945.09,they start to undulate the spine. 
3948.12,"So, this can be worked from this direction "
3950.37,or from this direction. 
3951.33,"And I believe by applying such a practice, "
3957.28,"it is wise, you basically turn over the lens "
3961.59,and you are allowing things 
3965.913,"to shift, and to move, and to adapt. "
3968.4,"So, I highly recommend it "
3969.99,and we teach it in a very elaborate and gradual way. 
3973.615,And this is needed really 
3977.16,"because people, when they just go "
3979.02,"into like some general recommendation, "
3980.91,"they usually just get stuck into a new pattern, "
3983.287,"""Ah, that spinal wave, "
3984.54,"okay, that's it."" "
3985.89,"So, I've been using, "
3986.91,"again, this slice and dice-like teaching "
3988.95,dozens of systems of moving the torso 
3991.74,until a person is freed to really move the torso 
3995.07,"like the language is created, "
3996.93,the small enough units are created in your understanding 
4000.77,from all these systems 
4002.45,"and then you improvise, "
4003.65,you reach the highest level of the practice. 
4006.8,- I love the answer. 
4008.48,Let me tell you a bit of why I asked. 
4012.56,"So, there's a principle in neuroscience, "
4016.49,"but especially in neuroevolution, "
4018.71,"they call it evo-devo sometimes, evolution and development, "
4021.59,how those link. 
4022.58,"If you look at, so we have motor neurons, "
4024.59,"as you know, but for the audience, "
4026.09,that live in our spinal cord 
4027.26,"that cause transmission and contraction of the muscles, "
4029.72,allows us to move our limbs. 
4031.46,"And then, we have motor neurons up here "
4033.08,called upper motor neurons 
4033.98,that control the motor lower ones. 
4035.75,"So, once something is reflexive or learned, "
4038.39,"we're not thinking about it, so to speak, "
4039.74,we mainly use the lower motor neurons. 
4041.42,"We know this because you can do an experiment, "
4043.22,"it's a rather barbaric experiment, "
4044.63,but it's been done many times 
4046.64,called creating a decerebrate cat. 
4048.92,You actually remove the neocortex 
4051.05,"and these cats will walk on a treadmill, "
4053.03,"it's called fictive motion, no problem at all. "
4055.55,There are human beings who don't have a neocortex 
4058.43,"or much of their neocortex is missing, "
4060.41,they generate perfectly fine movement. 
4062.357,- The pattern has been download. 
4064.28,"- That's right, and it's truly downloaded into the spine "
4067.88,and the connection between the spine and muscles. 
4069.98,"Now, the motor neurons "
4071.36,"that control the spinal waves, as you called them, "
4075.65,are of a particular category. 
4078.29,"They have a molecular signature, a physiological signature, "
4081.23,"they were identified by, he's dead now, "
4083.42,"but a biologist at Columbia University named Tom Jessell, "
4087.14,and many of his scientific offspring. 
4089.0,"Here's what's interesting, "
4090.71,in fish or in animals that really only have the opportunity 
4094.97,to undulate and flap their little fins. 
4100.58,"Though, motor neurons "
4101.78,that control undulation in those animals 
4104.6,are identical molecularly to the motor neurons that control 
4108.14,the spinal undulation in humans. 
4110.6,"What's been added in human evolution are extra rows, "
4114.56,"literally categories, of molecularly distinct neurons "
4117.35,"so that as you move from the center of the body outward, "
4120.68,"unlike a fish, which can move its fins, "
4123.47,"but can't actually, it doesn't have digits. "
4125.87,"We have special motor neurons to move these little bits, "
4129.02,"these bits, these bits, "
4131.24,"and I can't do a spinal wave, "
4133.04,"but I can do the mudras thing, "
4135.44,like the belly thing. 
4136.807,- Ah-ha. - That comes from seeing 
4138.32,"the movie ""E.T."" when I was a kid "
4139.85,and puffing out my stomach [Ido laughing] 
4141.11,"and then realizing that I could wave it, "
4143.18,but only in one direction and- 
4144.68,Okay. - apparently not up. 
4145.82,"Anyway, the yogis out there can chuckle at that, but. "
4150.56,- The yogis actually do it to the side. 
4152.45,"- Oh, do they? - Yeah. "
4153.56,- I don't know if I can do that. 
4155.54,"Anyway, my spinal wave is weak, but I'll work on it. "
4159.53,But what I find so interesting about these layers 
4162.86,"of, I don't want to say sophistication, "
4164.96,but these with evolution 
4167.96,came the addition of more pools of opportunity. 
4170.93,"These motor neuron pools, as they're called, "
4172.43,"are opportunity to engage in new, "
4175.16,more elaborate types of movement. 
4176.99,But with each new pool became the opportunity 
4179.75,to create combinations of new movement. 
4182.75,"And so, the reason I asked you why spinal waves "
4185.3,create one category of movement 
4186.98,"is that if you touch a fish on one side of its body, "
4190.22,"it moves to the opposite side, "
4191.87,it never moves toward it. 
4193.55,"But earlier we were doing a practice, "
4195.02,somewhat similar of testing this similar reflex. 
4198.2,"And sometimes I or someone will move toward a touch, "
4202.91,we don't deviate to the opposite side. 
4205.52,"So, I have this untested, "
4210.53,at least formally tested hypothesis 
4212.3,that movements of small digits 
4215.03,"and portions of our distal, as they're called, "
4217.01,far from the midline body parts 
4219.68,"evoke different sensations, "
4221.6,maybe even far more subtle sensations 
4223.79,than movements of the core of our body 
4225.644,and the stuff closer to the spine. 
4229.16,"Again, it's just a theory, "
4230.57,but I'm grateful for your answer 
4233.33,because it lands at least in the general vector direction 
4236.15,of my idea here. 
4239.54,"- The central orientation is mostly gone from our culture, "
4244.61,we don't even walk basically these days. 
4247.94,"If you look at traditional culture, "
4249.8,"the amount of walking you do on a rest day, it's huge. "
4254.03,"And so, we started to create technologies "
4257.66,"to bring everything into the periphery, "
4260.54,"controlling it with the fingertips, et cetera. "
4262.7,"So, we have incredible neurological development "
4265.91,"relating to this, but our central patterns, "
4269.87,"swimming, running, jumping, throwing, "
4273.74,"throwing is not pushing away, "
4275.93,"that's an example, right? "
4277.01,"- Like some people when you give them a ball to throw, "
4279.053,that you can tell if they've never 
4280.73,"thrown a ball before. - Yeah, "
4281.563,"they throw like a girl. - Yeah, they don't just- "
4282.938,- That is often said [Andrew laughing] 
4284.571,here in the US. 
4285.587,"And it's, of course, unfair, "
4286.79,"but it relates to experience, right? "
4289.52,That is less maybe promoted 
4292.97,"or offered for females, "
4294.41,so you get this peripheral pattern 
4297.89,instead of a central-generated pattern 
4300.44,that progresses towards the extremities. 
4304.58,One thing I wanted to ask you 
4307.49,is I know an area that is not often mentioned 
4311.54,is that some of these ancient patterns and systems 
4315.68,"are primary in many ways, "
4317.81,hence those newer developments inside of us 
4321.5,are constrained by using the connections 
4324.71,running through these ancient systems. 
4327.05,"Hence, we are much more limited "
4331.91,by the gene pool. 
4335.51,"We are hitchhikers on a piece of DNA, I like to say, "
4339.92,and that gene pool is like is driving something so primary 
4343.97,that even when you are in kind of the driver's seat 
4348.77,"in your eyes, you're actually not "
4350.9,or you're being totally constrained by that. 
4355.76,And I wanted to hear about this. 
4357.83,"- Yeah, recently we had a guest on the podcast "
4361.52,"named Erich Jarvis, he's a professor at Rockefeller, "
4364.37,who was offered a position to dance 
4367.4,with the Alvin Ailey dance company. 
4369.08,"So, an accomplished dancer "
4370.55,and comes from a musical family 
4371.84,chose to become a neuroscientist instead and study 
4373.94,speech and language. - Wow. 
4375.14,"But he said something incredible, "
4376.61,"several incredible things, "
4377.957,and really looking forward to getting your reflections on. 
4381.95,"First of all, he said that when you look at the species "
4385.85,"in the kingdom of animals, including us, "
4389.15,"that have elaborate language and true song, "
4394.19,they all also have the capacity to dance. 
4398.09,All the... 
4398.923,It turns out hummingbirds 
4399.89,actually have a dance and a song capacity. 
4402.86,"That perhaps, and this is the going idea "
4406.31,"now in neuroscience and evolution of the brain, "
4409.64,that singing actually came before 
4413.72,"finally articulated speech and language, "
4416.36,"that voice involved first to sing, to communicate. "
4419.57,"I mean, to enunciate ugh, or uh, or mm. "
4422.9,"You know, but then song may have come first. "
4426.26,"Where you have song, you have dance "
4429.05,"and the capacity to dance, "
4430.16,which of course is movement of the body. 
4432.08,"And where you have song and dance, "
4434.33,you always find that those species 
4436.7,can generate elaborate language. 
4438.95,"Now, the simple version of this is okay, "
4441.53,sophisticated brains tend to create clusters 
4443.84,"of sophisticated capabilities, "
4445.91,"but the other possibility, "
4447.11,and it's the one that Jarvis proposes 
4448.73,and I think it's in line 
4449.69,with what you're perhaps raising here 
4451.58,is the idea that movement of the body 
4454.46,and range and sophistication of movement of the body 
4457.79,through all these different systems 
4460.1,may have actually promoted or even driven the evolution 
4464.21,of the things that we think of as speech and language 
4469.1,"and the ability to have multiple words for the same concept, "
4473.24,or to have elaborate articulation of speech. 
4476.27,I find this incredibly attractive as an idea 
4479.54,"because certainly from as a hierarchy of needs, "
4483.26,"we needed to move first to survive, "
4485.15,"and to mate, and to flee, and to attack. "
4488.33,It makes perfect sense to me that the layers 
4489.98,would be built up fundamentally from the body to the mind 
4492.62,and not the other way around. 
4495.2,"So, that's one piece, "
4496.25,"and then the other piece, "
4497.54,which I'll just share for any reflections you might have 
4500.69,that just blew me away 
4502.43,"was Jarvis told me that when we read, "
4508.22,"if, and this has been done experimentally, "
4510.53,"if one records the EMG, "
4512.51,"the low level muscular activity in the larynx and pharynx, "
4516.14,"we are actually repeating the words that we read, "
4519.59,"but so subtly so that we don't actually speak them out, "
4523.7,"unless there's some sort of neurologic deficit, "
4526.16,"which some people have, some people mumble while they read. "
4528.56,But what that tells me is that language is movement 
4533.06,and movement is language. 
4535.1,"So, again, we have this convergence, "
4537.23,but at a very basic level 
4539.24,"I'd love your reflections on those are all his ideas, "
4542.06,"I want to say, I'm just repeating what he said "
4544.22,"and not nearly as precisely as he did, "
4547.58,but how do you think of movement 
4551.18,as either the foundation of language or as its own language 
4556.85,that perhaps even defies words? 
4558.83,"- Mm, [gasps]. "
4561.74,"Wow, those are beautiful perspectives, "
4564.89,and I definitely feel the same. 
4568.49,There's a lot to say about singing and dancing 
4570.77,as well as also as a form 
4572.75,of ancient programs of transmission. 
4580.52,Sometimes that there is this 
4582.98,"in some ancient practices, the mantras. "
4587.21,And people don't realize 
4590.51,"that they are tantric practices, "
4593.9,they contain a form of vibrating and breathing 
4601.79,all tied together into very elaborate way 
4605.6,to promote a certain effect. 
4608.06,And how would you do something like this in ancient times? 
4610.52,This is ingenious. 
4612.17,"We, even until today, "
4613.55,we need a full book to describe something 
4615.347,"and it wouldn't work as well, "
4617.48,so it's like a very ancient form of transmission. 
4621.95,"The more accurate we became with the language, "
4626.45,"the more dead it became, "
4628.73,"because it is less of a movement entity, "
4632.6,it is less of a dynamic entity from its nature. 
4635.93,"And that's why Yukio Mishima says, ""It's corrupting, "
4639.74,"it corrupts us."" "
4643.34,"So, definitely, definitely "
4644.6,the conducing force 
4649.16,or the primary force for me is movement that is experienced. 
4654.92,"Every time we talk about movement, "
4657.2,"basically, even now we are spilling it into a container "
4661.22,"to call it what it is, but it is beyond that. "
4665.87,"So, then it is applied into dancing, "
4669.02,"into singing, into language. "
4672.26,"There is no other language that I see as a primary mode, "
4676.49,"and this is a nature of space, time, things moving. "
4683.39,"So, I think everything moves "
4686.48,"into the direction of understanding that more and more, "
4689.45,and maybe it's not so popular to call it movement 
4693.44,"or people have some connotations, "
4695.18,"and it's okay, you can throw away this word "
4697.04,"and put another word, and we probably need to do that "
4699.65,"also like regularly, "
4700.88,like I start to see the end of this word for me. 
4705.5,"Things get corrupted again, overused, abused, "
4709.13,and then we need a new word. 
4712.85,And that's even that word is only needed for communication 
4716.75,"and for specific processes of education exchange, "
4721.49,it's important to stay within the experiences. 
4724.34,It's important to continue to promote scenarios 
4727.22,"in which the experience is primary, "
4730.79,"more open experience, let's say, "
4732.8,and not try to hold down 
4735.98,and define overly accurately 
4739.82,or if it's done throwing it away and starting again. 
4744.38,"So, there is no winning concept, "
4745.91,"you got to the winning concept, you got nothing. "
4749.84,"You were able to grab it, you were able to, "
4752.72,"this is very science, right? "
4754.06,"It's like, ""We got it, we got it,"" "
4756.59,and then it turns out to be nothing. 
4759.208,And like more and more time passes 
4763.16,I feel science is becoming more humble 
4766.76,and things are being discussed in this way. 
4772.19,And because really what does science do? 
4777.56,Report the sun came up 
4779.45,a certain amount of billions of times 
4782.87,and then tomorrow it will come up again. 
4786.23,"It's statistics. - Yeah, it's good prediction. "
4788.51,"- Yeah, yeah, but we can go beyond, "
4791.48,there is something inside of us that can go beyond. 
4794.72,"Hard to communicate, I can't offer it right now here, "
4798.02,but I have the experience and thankfully I have a practice 
4801.56,"and a way to sense it, to feel it, and to reexamine it, "
4805.76,"and then we can talk about it, and have something from that. "
4810.523,"- Edward Wilson, the great sociobiologist, "
4813.23,"he actually founded the field of sociobiology, "
4815.03,"E. O. Wilson, they call him, Edward Wilson, "
4817.73,had this beautiful word and indeed named a book. 
4820.34,"Actually, the word was better than the book, sorry Wilson, "
4822.53,"but the book was a little bit meandering for my taste, "
4825.62,"but then, again, he's the Harvard professor, not me. "
4829.1,"Well, Stanford's pretty darn good. "
4832.28,"This word is consilience, "
4833.72,this idea of a leaping together 
4835.34,of divergent forms of knowledge 
4837.08,"to create a truly valuable concept, which I love. "
4841.01,"I love it because, of course, I'm formally trained "
4843.26,"as a scientist, I look at things "
4844.49,"mainly through the lens of neuroscience, "
4845.9,but experience is real and observation is real. 
4851.51,"And even in the field of medicine, "
4852.98,you have double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials 
4856.31,"and then you have case studies, n-of-"
"1,",right? 
4861.14,"Not often discussed, "
4862.19,"right, I mean, H.M., "
4863.27,the most famous example in neuroscience 
4866.33,of a patient that had no hippocampus 
4868.73,informed us more about the process of memory 
4871.01,and indeed the function of the hippocampus 
4873.35,than thousands of independent experiments that followed. 
4877.46,"So, you can't have one, "
4879.53,"you need all these different forms of exploration, "
4881.57,"which is I think we share the belief, "
4885.29,"if I may, that convergent forms of knowledge, "
4888.59,eventually this process of consilience 
4890.96,can eject a new concept. 
4893.36,"And yet, the challenge, "
4894.44,"again, is that if we don't have a language for it, "
4897.35,it becomes hard to transmit. 
4899.81,"One of the things that I find incredibly, "
4904.37,"I'll use this word again, sticky "
4906.05,is this notion of movement culture. 
4908.63,"I don't know who coined that phrase, "
4910.28,or I've seen it in the circles 
4912.59,and accounts around your Instagram account and others. 
4916.22,"I don't know if that's a phrase that you coined, "
4918.89,"but this idea of engaging in movement practice with others, "
4922.01,whether or not it's dance or other movement practices 
4925.43,"because it's so dynamic, there's the unpredictability of it. "
4929.09,"Even to like today, "
4930.71,two practitioners at vastly different levels of knowledge 
4933.77,"and experience in movement practice, "
4935.57,"there's information, I like to think, to be gained "
4937.91,from both sides. [laughs] 
4939.71,So- - 
100%.,
4941.6,"So, one thing that I've heard you say before, "
4945.56,which really resonated with me 
4947.33,is this idea that people have maybe particularly in the US 
4951.14,"have this concept of, ""Oh, I have my yoga friends "
4955.1,or the people I dance with are distinct 
4957.23,"from my family friends, are distinct from."" "
4959.78,"But as you pointed out, gathering around movement "
4963.89,is an age-old tradition. 
4966.98,And that perhaps we better off not thinking 
4969.68,"about people we exercise with or train with, "
4972.23,but that friendship and connection made through movement 
4976.91,is perhaps the most valuable form of connection. 
4980.75,"- Yeah, I think it's a product of those practices "
4983.57,that are maybe not so aware 
4987.26,or not so movement-oriented in the open sense 
4990.35,"and then you get this sensation with people, "
4993.92,"but alone, we do nothing, "
4996.05,so much so that we're never alone 
4999.26,also on the inside and we will manufacture 
5002.59,"and produce entities inside, "
5007.99,so we're constantly 
5009.1,"in a dynamic exchange, cultural exchange. "
5011.5,"And practically, I learned this lesson in capoeira, "
5017.2,it's a cultural manifestation. 
5019.66,"Things happen within this context, "
5024.01,"we rub against reality, "
5025.99,we rub against each other 
5028.99,and their movement occurs 
5032.02,and their insight is to be gained and development happens 
5040.21,"and then comes other thoughts, "
5043.06,collective knowledge versus self-knowledge. 
5046.9,We are transmitting knowledge. 
5048.85,"If we go on top of some mountain, "
5051.79,
20,"people, "
20,"normal individuals, "
5057.862,and we spent 
20,years 
5060.58,"just fighting four hours in the morning, "
5063.97,"four hours in the afternoon, "
5066.85,and we do it for 
20,"years, "
5069.25,"but we're isolated from any other source of knowledge, "
5072.43,we would still not reach anything 
5075.01,that a very young fighter these days has. 
5081.1,We will be unable to develop 
5083.86,"those techniques, those insights, "
5086.02,that's where collective knowledge comes in 
5087.73,"and transmission jumps us forward, "
5091.24,but what is the problem with that? 
5093.11,Staying within just those technical constraints 
5096.73,"and never making it yours, "
5098.29,that's the part of self-knowledge. 
5101.95,The digestion of this collective information 
5105.64,"until it becomes digested and becomes part of yourselves, "
5109.6,and then you are it versus you are doing it. 
5114.19,And this is a clear separation that you can see in sports 
5117.46,"on a very high level and on a not so high level, "
5121.12,even though I would be honest 
5124.18,if I say that some people reach very far 
5127.45,just with collective knowledge 
5128.92,"and a very technical approach, "
5131.29,and others reach extremely far with very little of it. 
5136.39,"And there is always outliers, "
5138.43,there are always the outliers in that case. 
5141.07,"Another thought I had when you mentioned evo-devo, "
5145.93,evolution development is also the Greek concepts 
5149.62,of poiesis and physis. 
5155.05,"The growing of the seed into the tree, "
5161.05,and the other process 
5162.1,of the manufacturing of the chair from the tree. 
5167.89,"Two processes of development evolution, very different. "
5173.11,"One from everything to something, "
5175.87,the other from nothing to something. 
5178.24,"One is accumulation based, one is subtraction based. "
5183.19,"Both of these processes relate to collective knowledge, "
5186.25,"self-knowledge, but they're not exactly just that. "
5189.64,And what should we do? 
5191.53,"This is a question that my friend Rasmus, "
5194.23,"he asks in his thesis and thoughts, "
5198.31,what is the ultimate for us? 
5200.65,Should we manufacture our chair 
5203.53,or should we grow like into the tree? 
5206.95,"Civilize the mind, leave savage the body. "
5209.38,Is it in this way or should the mind also be left wild? 
5218.17,Wild and wise is a nice combination of words 
5221.697,"that I like to place together, wild, wise. "
5225.13,"So, this is something that I try to bring "
5228.58,into the way that I live my life and my practice. 
5230.98,"And I try to bring the information, "
5235.15,"and the wisdom, and the collective knowledge, "
5240.55,but I also try to let go of more and more 
5244.15,"until an essence is gleaned, "
5245.92,until something is appearing 
5248.44,and because everything was already there. 
5251.08,"For example, if I'm sitting here, "
5255.73,"all the movements are already occurring, "
5261.73,all the possibilities are. 
5264.91,"So, it's just about, I need to open, "
5267.61,"I open this window, the air would come from here. "
5269.89,"If I open this window, the air would come. "
5271.57,"I don't need to drive my motion, "
5273.58,I need to discover what is stopping it from happening. 
5277.63,"Something is constantly holding, "
5279.7,"and when we remove this immediately movement appears, "
5283.18,this is real deep movement 
5285.31,versus the driven movement 
5288.76,"that is a very wasteful of times like walking, "
5291.4,you see people pushing through the walk 
5293.29,instead of the controlled falling that it should be. 
5298.36,"Fighting, punching to manufacture the strength "
5304.03,and then to have someone who knows 
5307.03,how to facilitate the conditions 
5309.88,in which you are knocked out. 
5312.49,"It doesn't knock you out, "
5314.117,"""It hits versus I hit,"" like Bruce Lee said. "
5318.25,"So, this is a beautiful thing to examine "
5320.797,"and to work within that, "
5322.36,so it's to see am I skateboarding? 
5326.53,Am I using this perspective? 
5329.2,"Or am I trying to, to control because of risk and danger, "
5333.22,I'm trying to overly control something 
5335.05,that actually can never be controlled. 
5337.21,The way to control it is to let go of the control 
5340.27,"and then, okay, but what about all this collection "
5343.81,"of information, knowledge that I can bring in? "
5346.85,Where do I want to play? 
5348.88,I can play down here or I can play up here. 
5352.0,"The collective knowledge is maybe take you further in, "
5355.27,and then you're still going need to do your individual work. 
5358.09,A lot of people like to romanticize on that 
5360.1,"and it's you don't need teachers, we don't need nothing, "
5364.3,we don't need information. 
5365.89,"It's not fully honest, you don't need, "
5368.62,but depends on where you want to function 
5371.14,and how you want to function. 
5372.087,"They shouldn't be demonized, "
5373.84,but they shouldn't be overly glorified as well. 
5377.02,"- You mentioned about the opportunity for movement, "
5379.57,"perhaps even all forms of movement coming from deep within, "
5382.6,it raises to mind in the neuroscience of motor systems 
5386.8,"we talk about motor neurons, as I described, "
5389.11,the ones that actually evoke contraction of muscles. 
5392.71,"And then, there's this category of neurons "
5395.02,"that isn't often discussed, but certainly exist. "
5399.19,Aren't often discussed 
5400.24,"in kind of popular nomenclature of neuroscience, "
5402.1,which is the pre-motor system. 
5404.5,Most of our movements are the reflection 
5407.35,of certain patterns of transmission 
5411.1,breaking through from the pre-motor to the actual motor. 
5414.88,"In other words, we are always "
5416.89,in a anticipatory mode of movement. 
5420.94,"And as and I think you, the way you describe it, "
5423.61,"you clearly intuitively understand this, "
5425.41,"you feel it, and you recognize it. "
5427.3,And think of it as it's like a layer of neurons 
5430.12,that's constantly humming 
5431.701,[hums] ready to go. 
5433.39,And it's the release of these gates 
5435.07,"that allows movement to occur in a particular way, "
5437.8,"could be very smooth, could be very ballistic. "
5440.35,"- Which is DNA, the same, "
5443.08,"turning off and on, all the information is already there. "
5446.56,- Right. - And then the possibilities 
5447.847,are just allowed. 
5449.5,"So, I'm allowed, "
5450.91,"I don't do free will already, "
5455.47,"but I am allowed to do, I am. "
5459.61,There are possibilities 
5461.65,"and I am dancing within that dance, "
5467.53,but I am not the only dancer. 
5470.35,"So, that's, that's my sensation "
5472.69,at least with most 
5478.18,"states of being, let's say. "
5480.19,"Maybe there is other states that could be reached, "
5485.86,"a stability that will arrive from the waters, "
5488.98,"from the movement of the waters, "
5491.17,"this humming, these potential possibilities "
5495.67,"to be in that state, "
5497.44,to vibrate like this is very powerful for our lives. 
5501.4,To wake up in the morning and feel that living thing 
5505.18,"is the feeling of movement, "
5506.473,"and, for me, it's a result of the practice. "
5508.99,"And so, then it's easy not to stagnate "
5513.07,and then the mind can stay focused for hours 
5515.44,"like we've done today, "
5516.79,and I can listen and tune in and I won't lose you. 
5521.11,"Which is very difficult, "
5522.01,like I haven't had a good conversation 
5523.84,"here in the US it's very difficult, "
5526.45,"and I've had your attention and you're listening, "
5529.09,but it's rare. 
5530.32,"It's rare that somebody can do that, "
5531.85,"and it's a struggle, always a struggle, "
5534.61,"but it's definitely my trick, my dirty trick. "
5538.48,- In that you said you're allowed 
5541.03,"and, again, I'm taking some of the language "
5542.98,and what you report about your experience 
5545.32,and I'm trying to map it to some concepts 
5547.96,that relate to neural circuits. 
5549.67,"In the principles of neuroscience, "
5552.52,we talk about instructiveness versus permissiveness. 
5556.81,"There are instructive cues, "
5558.16,"like for instance, the ability to pick up this pen, right? "
5561.19,"There's an instruction, clearly there's a motor command, "
5565.0,but that's just one way of looking at it. 
5566.83,The way it actually works 
5568.0,is that there's a pre-motor system 
5569.77,"that's already generating that movement, "
5571.81,and what we've done is we've flung open the gate 
5573.73,and allowed that movement to occur precisely. 
5576.07,- Surfing it. 
5577.78,"- Right. - Surfing that current, "
5578.793,"or this current, or another current, "
5581.14,or opening the window. 
5582.58,"- Exactly, and if you look at the formal study "
5587.23,"of movement and improvement of movement, "
5590.74,the most basic example I can give is like a tennis serve. 
5594.28,"And they, if you just, "
5595.117,and they've done this many times over. 
5596.92,"You map the trajectories, "
5598.09,"and in a novice the lines are all over the place, "
5601.09,it ends up looking more like a tangle 
5603.91,"of rubber band ball, right? "
5605.92,"Whereas in the Federer or the expert, "
5608.92,"you almost wonder if it's just one line being drawn, "
5611.62,but it's the trajectories are incredibly stereotyped. 
5615.04,That's the reflection of one little narrow gate 
5617.11,"opening again, and again, and again. "
5619.24,Of course- - Let me inject 
5621.1,"something here from an old neurologist, you can say, "
5625.72,"Bernstein, the Soviet. "
5628.946,"And he talked about degrees of freedom, "
5631.57,and they did in order to increase productivity 
5634.63,in Soviet Union. 
5637.36,I don't know if you you've heard this story. 
5639.267,- [Andrew] No. 
5640.69,- He was brought in to examine the movement habits 
5643.63,of the workers and he collected some information. 
5649.39,"He placed, he was one of the first kinetic, "
5652.48,"I don't know how it's called in English, "
5654.4,the kinetic capturing of motion 
5657.61,with moving pictures in that time. 
5660.37,"And so, he placed these dots and they took these photos, "
5664.45,which became kind of moving. 
5666.76,"And what he discovered was something very interesting, "
5670.21,the accuracy of the heat of the sledgehammer 
5676.12,increased while the variants in the various points 
5681.94,"became more, not less. "
5683.92,"So, it wasn't a fixed pattern, "
5686.05,it was a meta pattern. 
5688.48,And this pattern is adjusted 
5691.63,in this way to achieve the perfect execution. 
5695.86,"Those were very early findings, "
5697.57,"and I'm not sure how does that sit with everything, "
5700.75,but I'm sure there is some truth to it from my experience. 
5705.22,"Basically, the self-adjusting dynamic nature of the system "
5709.36,allows you to reach a very constant 
5712.93,and stable end result by being so open 
5717.88,and letting go of your control. 
5719.32,"- Mm-hmm, the example you give fits very well "
5722.98,with the one that I described before 
5724.75,because and I'm recalling the experiment. 
5726.61,"If people want to look this up, it's a paper, "
5728.26,"we'll put it in the show note caption, "
5729.88,a guy also happens to be at Harvard 
5732.19,"named Bence Ã–lveczky, a Hungarian, "
5734.41,"I'm clearly pronouncing his name wrong, "
5735.88,but I know Bence. 
5736.99,"And I remember the slide in my mind's eye, "
5739.9,and the trajectory that was mapped 
5741.25,"was the movement of the tennis racket, "
5742.66,not of the limbs themselves in the Federer case. 
5745.66,"So, that I think aligns well with what you're describing. "
5748.69,"Yeah, that exploration of degrees of freedom "
5751.27,is where the opportunity 
5752.77,for real advancement 
5756.67,and expansion of skill shows up. 
5758.23,As that I think the way it's been described to me 
5759.94,is that we go from unskilled to skilled 
5763.33,"and then there's mastery, "
5764.38,"and then there's this top tier, "
5765.76,"which is this beautiful, thin layer "
5767.98,"that so few people occupy, which is virtuosity, "
5770.68,in which the practitioner invites variability 
5773.89,and chance back in as an opportunity to do truly new things. 
5781.93,"- It made me think many years ago, "
5784.3,this kind of thinking about so what is that entity? 
5788.38,"Because obviously, it's not technique, "
5790.72,and it wouldn't even be honest 
5792.07,"to say it's a movement pattern, "
5794.38,there is too much diversity there. 
5797.17,"I started to talk about, "
5798.55,"I called it movement sleeves or meta technique, "
5802.12,but the word technique is already misleading. 
5807.79,"So, there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve "
5811.45,in which you can move in 
5813.73,"as long as you are not out of this sleeve, "
5816.1,you are still within the boundaries 
5818.26,of achieving the result that you're after. 
5821.77,"And then, the result is adaptation "
5824.53,of all these elements inside to keep you in the sleeve. 
5827.77,"The sleeve is not constricted as we once thought, "
5831.287,"""Oh, beautiful technique."" "
5833.38,"There are many ways to skin a cat, "
5837.07,"and that experience, and that variety, that diversity "
5841.9,goes into virtuosity. 
5843.46,It's true freedom because your focus is on the right thing. 
5847.66,"You don't point at the moon, look at your finger, "
5850.51,"and that's really in essence being a virtuoso, "
5854.77,"for me, like mastery, let's say if there is such a thing. "
5859.09,"- Oh, there's I do believe there is such a thing "
5861.13,and I'll flatter and attempt to embarrass you 
5864.13,by saying I think that I'm not alone 
5865.6,in viewing you as a virtuoso of movement. 
5867.67,I think that's what comes to mind 
5870.28,because there's this notion 
5871.66,"that not everything is pre-planned, "
5874.45,that even you might not know 
5876.19,"what you're going to do next until the moment of execution, "
5879.04,but that here I'm projecting my own assumptions. 
5885.37,I'd like to talk about mindsets 
5887.95,"in approaching practice a little bit more, "
5890.95,but I want to wade into that territory 
5893.74,"by talking about vision in the eyes, "
5896.8,something that we both share a deep interest in. 
5899.35,"I from the background of visual neuroscience, "
5901.57,but also from the realization 
5902.95,that we have this incredible ability 
5905.53,"to adjust the aperture of our visual window, "
5907.72,we can focus very narrowly and we can focus very broadly. 
5911.44,"So, something I encountered, I think first as a child, "
5913.63,realizing that I could spend all day 
5915.64,watching ants play in a very fine domain 
5918.61,and then look up and go inside 
5919.93,"and realize there's a whole world and realizing, ""Wow, "
5923.05,I'll never be able to consume 
5924.94,"the full range of experiences at any one moment."" "
5928.63,There are ants probably in the corner of this room 
5930.79,doing their thing. 
5932.83,And so too our approach to movement 
5935.47,"can be, as you mentioned, very big and dynamic "
5938.14,in terms of the broad movements 
5939.97,of our limbs or fine articulation. 
5942.28,When you begin a practice 
5944.38,"and as you move through a practice, "
5946.63,do you apply a regimented way of focusing your vision? 
5952.84,Are you in panoramic vision? 
5954.37,Are you in a very narrow field of view? 
5956.68,Or does it entirely depend? 
5958.51,"And for the person who's a true beginner, "
5960.52,"a true novice, like myself, "
5962.5,how should I show up to the practice with my eyes? 
5967.24,- The eyes are a good starting point 
5969.88,as you help a lot of people to understand. 
5973.66,"And when you encounter difficulties with other layers, "
5977.32,it's very powerful to start with the eyes. 
5979.99,Another thing important to understand 
5983.05,"and to experience, you can't believe me, "
5986.26,"or you've got to examine it for yourself, "
5989.65,we do not move the eyes as well as we think we do. 
5994.48,"'Cause as long as you can see and move the eyes, "
5997.66,"people never think about it, that it can be trained, "
6001.23,"that it can be improved, et cetera, "
6003.36,and the effects of it are far reaching. 
6007.59,"The eyes lead to the inner eye, "
6009.99,you can think of it in a beautiful metaphorical way. 
6015.48,And it's a representation of the way 
6018.483,that we use various cognitive and mind processes 
6024.06,"and also, of course, affect the body. "
6026.88,The eyes lead in many ways 
6030.57,and the head is also a very because all of these inputs 
6034.86,are coming in here. 
6036.51,"So, it's very easy to lead the body "
6038.55,"and if you look at it centrally from the head, "
6041.58,it's a very powerful and easy thing. 
6043.56,"For example, when you teach boxers how to bob, "
6049.17,usually it's not done 
6050.25,"in the way that I believe it should be done, "
6053.91,you teach it with the periphery. 
6056.34,They teach it from the feet 
6058.59,"because they have the idea, which is correct, "
6060.57,"that you need to do it in spatial conditions, "
6064.47,"in movement, in space. "
6067.32,"But in reality, the head will organize the feet for you. "
6071.46,"Instead, you are now putting two elements together "
6074.1,"and then with years of practice, "
6075.63,you hope of tying them together well. 
6078.15,I prefer to do something else 
6079.5,"because if I'll pull your head now to side, "
6082.65,you will immediately start to organize your feet under you. 
6085.98,"So, I give you just one element "
6087.54,"to manipulate the system from, "
6088.89,that's how I would teach someone something like this. 
6092.16,"Many animals hunt with the head, "
6094.32,so you can see the body running forward 
6096.45,"while the head is turning to the side, "
6098.22,the whole thing follows afterwards. 
6100.29,"So, it's a very powerful way to address movement, "
6102.48,"not the only one, "
6104.46,"there are many modes, thankfully, "
6106.02,"and we're very adaptable in that, "
6107.67,but definitely a primary one. 
6110.28,"And then, the use of the eyes is, of course, "
6112.59,maybe the most important element with that usually. 
6118.95,"Yeah, what else can I say about the eyes? "
6121.5,"So, how do you come in? "
6123.03,"Well, it depends on the practice, "
6124.53,you need to start to have some kind of a checklist 
6128.43,of what you're looking to do. 
6131.22,"And then by this, "
6132.09,you can start to tailor the way that you use your eyes. 
6135.9,"The same thing I do for posture, "
6138.3,"the same thing I do for stance, "
6140.16,the same thing eventually I do for state. 
6143.61,"And there is different flavors, "
6145.05,there is no correct way to use the eyes. 
6146.85,"Sometimes it's very peripheral, "
6148.53,"soft, open awareness orientation, "
6151.86,sometimes it's very focused. 
6154.62,"Notice that I'm pulling these two opposites, "
6158.37,"awareness and focus, "
6159.84,"which is often put together and fused, "
6162.57,but and then the eyes 
6166.02,are like the immediate 
6167.88,and the easiest entry point into that. 
6171.33,"Another thing is the placement of the head and the eyes, "
6175.95,"like for example, when we lower our chin, "
6179.13,we seem to see better. 
6182.52,"When we raise the eyebrows, "
6184.89,there is too much exposure of top light sources 
6188.31,and so people would usually when looking into the distance 
6191.16,will tilt their chin in. 
6193.38,"And in many scenarios, tilting of the chin to the side, "
6197.16,"or placing just like listening with the ear, "
6200.85,"placing a certain eye or dominant eye, "
6203.73,depending on various scenarios. 
6206.49,And this is all like information 
6208.2,"that I can come in cerebrally, "
6211.2,"and think about, and jump my practice forward. "
6214.71,"Instead, of just letting the experience teach me that, "
6218.52,I'm using some kind of a thinking process to improve. 
6221.34,"And this is not cheating, this is great. "
6224.43,Will it work? 
6225.45,"We got to try, it's a process. "
6228.69,And those are some thoughts and to start to play with. 
6231.63,"- Yeah, I love that you mentioned chin down "
6236.07,because we all have a natural reflex 
6237.75,"when chin goes down, eyes goes up, "
6239.4,"and the opposite is true when head goes up, eyes go down. "
6243.3,And there are two separate clusters of neurons 
6245.58,"in these cranial nerve nuclei that, as we call them, "
6250.17,"when eyes are up, "
6252.45,it increases our level of alertness overall. 
6254.949,"This is not woo science, "
6258.03,this is the function of these cranial nerve nuclei. 
6262.11,"When our eyes are down, "
6264.54,we go into states of more calm and quiescence. 
6267.3,"And this makes perfect sense, "
6268.38,"you know, and then the eyelids usually go down "
6270.0,and then people fall asleep. 
6271.59,Eyes up does not mean head up 
6273.69,"'cause, as you said, there's a very dynamic control "
6275.85,over the amount of luminance depending on the environment. 
6278.43,"So, that and then, as you mentioned, "
6281.34,"this difference between focus and awareness, "
6283.89,I think is a really important one. 
6286.17,"When we are in this more panoramic, soft gaze "
6289.77,"and broad awareness, big swaths of visual field, as we say, "
6293.85,the neurons that control that 
6295.44,come through a pathway called magnocellular pathway. 
6297.48,"In any event, those neurons are much thicker, "
6299.52,"thicker cables, they transmit much faster, "
6301.47,just like thick pipes can carry more water more quickly. 
6305.58,And your reaction time is at least four times 
6309.3,what it is in this awareness mode 
6311.76,than it is when you're narrowly focused on something. 
6314.13,"And this is counterintuitive, I think, to a lot of people, "
6316.47,but the person who is running to catch the ball 
6318.27,"is not tracking the ball in a smooth movement, "
6321.232,most of their vision is in peripheral vision. 
6323.52,When we drive we're in this peripheral vision 
6325.77,"and our reaction times are much, much faster. "
6328.53,"So, I don't know if I'm reluctant to encourage people "
6332.73,to shift toward a particular type of practice 
6334.98,toward a particular type of vision. 
6336.15,"I think what you and I, "
6337.539,"I hope agree on, correct me if I'm wrong, "
6341.16,is that exploring these different extremes 
6344.61,and everything in between is where the real value is. 
6346.95,"Panoramic focused, "
6349.23,"eyes, head up, eyes down, "
6351.21,"head down, eyes up, "
6352.26,playing with it and exploring it 
6354.6,and as opposed to for the first 
10,minutes of practice 
6358.86,being panoramic vision. 
6360.06,"You know, the sort of- "
6360.893,- Yeah. - earlier today we were joking 
6362.67,about and kind of lamenting the fact 
6365.4,that this word biohacking exists 
6367.47,"or that the optimal performance, "
6369.42,it's that they're unfortunate terms 
6371.19,"because they suggest that if you just plug it in, "
6373.56,it's going to be like two plus two equals four 
6375.15,and you're going to get it right every time. 
6377.61,"- Another pragmatic bit here, if I can offer, "
6380.4,is since our culture 
6385.74,"has been more geared and pushing us towards focus, "
6389.021,"the focus use of the eyes, "
6390.45,"and primary language, reading, and other things, "
6394.71,we have less opportunities 
6396.6,to work with the more open panoramic one. 
6399.63,"So, it would be smart "
6401.52,to start to balance things out a bit more. 
6405.57,"When you're in nature, you don't look at each leaf, "
6408.81,"everything is moving, and you are kind of immersed in that. "
6412.32,"And then, something attracts your attention, "
6413.917,"""Oh, it's a bird,"" and you focus, "
6415.8,"and you go back into the general state, "
6419.19,"the base state, which is open awareness. "
6422.79,"Here, we switch things around in our modern culture, "
6425.82,"we are mostly focused and then we sometimes daydream, "
6430.11,which is maybe some kind 
6431.914,of a balancing act 
6436.02,"that comes from deep within, "
6437.52,"I don't know, maybe you can share "
6440.1,"some information about that, "
6441.3,"but I see that many time people need to, "
6444.45,the focus is overly done by far in our lives. 
6449.49,"- I couldn't agree more, "
6450.84,and I think a lot of I'll even venture so far as to say 
6453.39,that a lot of the visual deficits 
6456.45,"that we now see in young people, "
6458.34,"myopia, literally nearsightedness, occurs "
6461.4,because if we look at things that are too close to us 
6463.56,"as children or as adults, "
6464.82,the eyeball actually gets longer. 
6466.83,The lens focuses the visual image in front 
6470.82,"of nearer to the lens, nearsighted, "
6473.28,than in front of where it should land. 
6476.76,"And basically, it's a lack of panoramic vision "
6481.17,that is or open awareness that's driving these changes. 
6484.59,"And nowadays, we are essentially, "
6486.87,most people are 
90%,of the time in this narrow focus mode. 
6491.04,"You know, right before recording, "
6492.09,we took a break and went up to look at a vista 
6494.4,"and to look off to the distance, incredibly useful, "
6498.3,"easy practice at some level, "
6499.74,but I think most people are not doing this sort of thing. 
6502.41,And the way that it shapes the mind 
6503.97,"and the perception of time, "
6505.23,"of course, is a whole other kingdom of ideas. "
6508.35,But one thing I'd like to relate 
6511.29,this element of vision to and open awareness 
6513.69,"is earlier you mentioned the cone of auditory attention, "
6516.54,the other sense that we can play with 
6518.88,in as in our practice and throughout the day. 
6523.65,Do you see any value to both paying attention to things 
6527.61,"in a very narrow cone of auditory attention, "
6529.62,but also just walking and listening 
6531.9,to all the sounds at once? 
6533.7,I could imagine that could be useful. 
6535.38,"And in terms of physical movement practices, "
6538.65,I was going to say where are your ears? 
6540.24,"Your ears are always more or less in the same place, "
6542.1,but where is your hearing when you approach your practice? 
6546.238,"- Another set of parameters to think about, "
6549.66,"and to play with, and to be aware of. "
6553.53,"Also, I have the experience that some people "
6556.95,are better at using this system or that system. 
6562.5,And you would be amazed how differently the same results 
6567.69,seemingly outside results are done 
6569.58,by different practitioners and different scenarios. 
6575.1,This goes into this mutation and change idea 
6577.62,is what really jumps us forward eventually 
6580.89,some kind of a mutation. 
6582.75,"So, it's like all of our culture, and practices, and success "
6587.34,"puts us closer and closer to each other, "
6590.16,so we have the same opinions everywhere around the world 
6594.42,"becoming more and more the same, "
6596.94,"less and less different, "
6598.65,"but the real hope comes from the different, "
6602.49,so and we have a difficulty in promoting that. 
6609.57,"And so, this is another thing that can be promoted "
6613.38,"with the right practices, "
6615.54,"the right, for example, I work with corporates "
6619.29,or even worked with governments before 
6622.11,to bring in some of that freshness 
6624.09,"with simple habits in the workday, "
6626.61,"or in the education of children, "
6628.89,or in companies increasing productivity. 
6634.74,"I don't really give a fuck, "
6636.72,but I am there to give what I view is important 
6641.34,"and what is important maybe increases productivity, "
6646.02,but it's more important to me 
6647.22,that it improves people's lives who are involved 
6650.43,"and improves, yeah, being and becoming, "
6656.1,"being and becoming, these two entities. "
6659.19,"I'm not there, I'm on my way, I'm a process. "
6662.91,"So, thinking about hearing, "
6666.75,"the way that people use their ears, "
6669.06,the way that people use listening. 
6672.21,"Again, we can talk about placement of the head and posture, "
6677.01,"sometimes angling as well, sharper angle, chin down, "
6680.7,"some people tend to use the shape of the ear, "
6684.81,people with different ears closer or further out. 
6688.89,This is it's if you're very sensitive 
6691.5,"and you're looking around, "
6692.37,you would see this is affecting people's motion. 
6697.26,"Even the shape of our face, "
6700.44,like the development of the vocal chords 
6702.27,"and speaking will totally change how we are, how we look, "
6706.32,but how we listen also will do the same. 
6711.24,"I don't have any proof of it, "
6712.56,but it is something I believe in. 
6716.624,"- Well, people will even make their ears bigger, right? "
6719.16,"We, we try and become like little fennec foxes or something "
6722.34,"by, I mean, a lot of people don't realize "
6724.2,that's actually why we do this 
6725.18,"is to capture more sound waves, right? "
6727.41,And the leaning is that the localization of sound 
6729.722,is based on a simple brainstem calculation 
6732.24,"of interaural time differences, "
6734.37,"the time in which something, "
6736.35,"the brain intuitively, it just knows "
6739.08,'cause it's a pretty hardwired circuit 
6740.91,"that if a sound arrives first to this ear then that ear, "
6743.46,that it's likely coming from over here. 
6746.55,"Whereas, if it's dead center, "
6748.23,"arrives at the two at the same time, "
6749.85,"that it's almost ridiculously simple when one hears it, "
6753.45,"no pun intended, "
6754.53,but it is an incredibly valuable way of thinking 
6759.69,about how the architecture of the body 
6762.57,changes our experience. 
6765.3,"Along those lines earlier, you mentioned something "
6767.37,and it flagged an important question for me. 
6771.93,When I see people walking 
6775.192,"sometimes I think, ""Wow, they really move in a strange way."" "
6779.31,"Occasionally you see somebody, "
6780.33,"they walk really, it's impressive for whatever reason, "
6783.93,"you know, and you just think, ""Wow, "
6784.95,"they sort of glide along."" "
6787.53,"People come in different shapes and sizes, "
6789.33,"short torsos, long arms, et cetera. "
6793.11,Do you think that if people have a body type 
6796.26,that facilitates certain kinds of movement and not others 
6799.35,that they should intentionally try and move in the way 
6802.86,that is right at the edge 
6804.6,of the kind of friction and challenge 
6807.81,"in order to shape new possibilities, "
6811.83,or do you think that they should lean 
6813.15,into the smooth execution 
6814.89,of what comes most naturally to them? 
6817.71,"- Yeah, I think a good practice is to have many walks "
6825.9,because they're required. 
6827.04,"And, of course, there is a very efficient "
6829.86,"and endurance, stamina-oriented thing "
6832.83,"that if you have the experience, "
6834.96,it will naturally develops and unravel. 
6837.6,"And if not, "
6838.433,you can get some collective knowledge and improve. 
6841.92,"And then there is a lot of emotion, "
6845.52,emotional things related to walk 
6847.5,like how I'm walking into a business meeting 
6851.94,and/or how I'm walking 
6856.29,out of a bad situation. 
6859.47,And there is a lot of beautiful things to research there 
6864.27,"practically with yourself, "
6865.95,"trying to approach someone with the chin slightly down, "
6868.98,"very linear, very efficient in the straightest line, "
6872.1,or trying to approach someone a little bit more rounded 
6874.89,"from the side and tilting your head, "
6877.71,"and you will see totally different results, "
6880.56,totally different communication that happens 
6884.01,over people's heads. 
6885.09,"But if you're sensitive, you realize that, ""Wow, "
6887.91,"this opened the door."" "
6889.62,"Instead, many people you start on the minus. "
6892.14,"My sister, my big sister, Atali, "
6893.82,"she always says, ""I started on the minus, "
6896.7,"why don't I start on zero with them?"" "
6899.13,"You know, so, but it's part of the approach. "
6902.61,"You can affect that, and you can start even on the plus "
6905.43,if you are the sly man as the practitioner needs to be. 
6910.62,"So, this is something to play with and to work with "
6914.31,"and then you have, of course, body proportions, "
6916.56,"and ways, and we have all these like technical invasions, "
6920.52,"mathematics, and trigonometry, and architecture, "
6923.58,"they invaded our bodies, they invaded our nervous system. "
6927.27,"And now, our walk and our physical practices, "
6930.09,"they look linear and efficient, "
6932.7,"the path between two points is a straight line, "
6934.8,"it's not, this is biomechanics, "
6936.6,"it's not mechanics, nothing there is a given, "
6941.43,there's no gospel. 
6943.26,"So, the walkers is sometimes have to go around "
6947.4,"or sway from side to side, "
6949.05,and there is coiling and coiling and there are moving bits. 
6951.69,And what about the coordination 
6953.76,of my breathing with my walk? 
6955.2,"Because if I walk too linearly, "
6957.39,there is less pumping of the air naturally in and out 
6960.36,so now I have to forcefully 
6962.1,"bring it in and out, I'm wasteful. "
6964.92,"And that's why you see in last years, "
6967.77,"these incredible runners, especially in long distance, "
6972.03,doing things we never thought were possible 
6976.399,"in the worst possible way that we used to think, "
6981.63,pronation and all kinds of things 
6983.883,like our technical thoughts 
6986.22,were totally misguided and wrong. 
6990.99,"And then, somebody comes in and does it in some way "
6996.15,that is totally wrong 
6997.08,and he gets results we could never get. 
7000.62,"And that's the beauty of playfulness, "
7003.35,"experimentation, change, being different. "
7008.18,- As you're describing this I'm smiling 
7009.5,"because one of my favorite neuroscientists, "
7012.32,"he's out of the university of Chicago, "
7014.99,was in a meeting and there was an argument 
7016.79,about evolution of the nervous system 
7018.26,"and he said, ""At the end,"" "
7020.87,and people were arguing about whether or not this gene 
7023.12,in one animal was homologous 
7024.71,"to this gene in humans, et cetera, "
7026.3,it can get very dicey. 
7027.95,"And he said very, very appropriately that, "
7031.617,"""One of the major jobs of evolution "
7033.53,is to take existing cell types and circuits 
7036.17,and give them new functions. 
7037.76,But that can only be done through the playful exploration 
7041.48,"of new possibilities,"" "
7043.16,"which I think maps very well to what you're saying, "
7045.77,"that at the extreme thresholds of technical execution, "
7049.91,"you know, mastery, mastery, mastery, you, "
7052.28,"your obviously performance is very high, "
7054.95,"but the opportunity for evolution of the sport, "
7057.71,"or the music, or the dance, or the intellectual endeavor "
7060.65,is limited because you're not introducing variability. 
7064.07,"In the attempt to get proper execution, "
7066.8,you're limiting oneself. 
7069.02,"- Hence, I want to offer something that is relating to you. "
7075.17,We should be wary 
7076.34,of defining the mechanisms 
7083.54,and putting certain meaning with certain processes and ways 
7088.97,because just history and experience shows 
7091.55,"it doesn't work well for us most times, "
7095.167,or it becomes like this much more elaborate thing 
7098.6,even if we were somewhat in the right direction 
7102.53,because even thinking this way can offer a lot. 
7106.13,"Like for example, your advice "
7108.26,"about heat, dopamine, light, "
7110.51,"offers a lot of benefit, but also can create problems "
7114.47,and it can enclose something 
7118.4,which the improviser 
7122.75,"will find, the MacGyvers, right? "
7124.7,"Like take a pink, some paper clip, "
7128.15,and you make it into something great. 
7131.15,"And this is really our, "
7134.42,we are the biggest improvisers around 
7136.37,"like that's what made us who we are, I think, "
7138.707,and this is incredible what we can do with it. 
7142.46,"You know, the Russian-American space exploration story "
7147.47,"with the space pen, "
7148.91,famous story about the development of the space pen. 
7152.42,- I don't know. - It's a- 
7153.32,- A space pen? - Yeah. 
7154.411,"- No, I don't know about this. "
7155.41,- I think it's an urban myth. 
7157.78,"I don't know if it's true, but I like it so I use it. "
7161.15,"Well, there was this, of course, a space competition "
7165.71,and the Russians put the first animal in space 
7169.566,and the first. - He was a macaque monkey 
7171.07,"or something like that, yeah. - Yeah. "
7172.936,"And then Laika, and they put the first Sputnik, "
7177.68,"the satellite, and men in space, "
7180.23,but Americans took the man on the moon. 
7183.89,And on the way a lot of technologies got developed 
7186.347,and the Americans because of lack of gravity out there 
7189.17,"developed the space pen with a huge investment, "
7191.93,the Russians used a pencil. 
7193.801,[Andrew laughing] 
7196.55,"So, I don't know if it's true, "
7198.77,"I don't think it is, "
7199.61,but it represents something in the state of mind. 
7202.49,"Like you look at, for example, "
7203.63,"the military equipment in Soviet equipment, "
7206.72,it all can do multiple things 
7209.57,"and it means that it's heavier, "
7211.1,"it's less efficient, it's not as light, "
7214.13,but even the Navy SEALs will still carry an AK 
7219.32,"with certain conditions, why? "
7221.69,Because you can pour a whole bucket of sand 
7223.76,into the mechanism and it will keep running 
7226.13,while the most advanced German Heckler & Koch 
7229.13,"and accurate and light weapons, "
7231.74,for every grain can get stuck and overly specialized. 
7235.19,And there is something about this openness 
7236.87,"that we humans need to keep, "
7239.42,and also maybe something for our leaders 
7242.39,"to be more of less specialists and more in this openness, "
7245.99,"less capable in this or that way, "
7248.78,but more capable of doing the whole thing. 
7253.67,"- I love the story, whether or not it's a legend or not, "
7257.3,it's legendary because it's fantastic. 
7260.48,"As you say, in the laboratory, "
7261.56,"whenever someone takes on a project in my lab, "
7263.42,"I always say, ""You know, you have to ask yourself "
7265.61,how much technical detail and challenge you want to take on 
7269.09,"because with more technology, advanced technology, "
7272.18,"yes, there's the opportunity for more discovery, "
7273.98,but more downtime. 
7275.33,Your PhD will literally take longer 
7277.58,if you're going to use a microscope 
7278.87,that's out of commission 
30%,"of the time, "
7281.72,"and you just have to understand that."" "
7283.49,"So, there's a dynamic interplay there. "
7286.31,"- By the way, I think that scientists get it right, "
7289.01,it's where you transmit the knowledge 
7290.917,out of the scientific field 
7292.91,"because science have debate and everything, "
7295.46,"you're not so connected, "
7296.99,"of course this can happen as well, "
7298.31,but then when it goes out 
7300.74,and the simple person without the experience 
7305.51,"takes it more as a gospel, as a fixed thing, "
7308.12,and then it was just a report. 
7309.95,- Right. - It was just reporting 
7311.0,"some functions here and play with it, "
7313.25,see what it does for you. 
7315.133,"Because with all the greatest information that I can give, "
7319.01,the person will examine it 
7320.267,and it might be not useful at all for him. 
7324.02,"This is the practitioner, make it your own, "
7326.75,"go practice, try heat, cold, light, "
7330.74,"movement, awareness to this, awareness to this. "
7334.196,"And this is up to you to make it yours, "
7336.44,but we don't like to have this responsibility. 
7339.83,"- No, people prefer to have "
7341.42,that this will work the first time every time 
7344.15,and will serve you best compared to everything else. 
7347.69,"And while there are more reliable tools than others, "
7351.5,"in my mind, the more reliable tools "
7353.6,tend to be ones that are grounded in our innate physiology 
7359.51,"as opposed to some, I don't like the word hack, "
7361.82,"in fact, I loathe the word biohack, "
7363.71,"as we were talking about again earlier, "
7365.93,because a hack in my mind is something 
7368.36,that is designed for one purpose 
7370.01,"that's used for another, "
7371.587,"it's not the most efficient use of that tool, "
7374.6,nor is it naturally the best solution. 
7377.45,"Whereas, biology has some very good solutions, "
7379.91,"but they don't always work, not every time. "
7383.6,"Earlier today, we did a practice "
7385.04,"in which involved a invasion, "
7388.79,"shall we say, of peripersonal space. "
7391.34,"We weren't standing super close for any particular reason, "
7394.19,but there was God forbid- - God forbid. 
7396.74,- But there was we were close enough together 
7400.13,we could touch one torsos 
7401.78,and we were doing that as part of this practice. 
7404.15,And you encouraged me to pay attention 
7406.13,to how does it feel 
7407.78,to have someone in your peripersonal space? 
7410.3,"And then, this notion of reactivity. "
7412.07,I find this an immensely interesting 
7414.17,and potentially powerful practice 
7416.72,"because I think a lot of people, "
7418.52,I know a lot of people suffer from anxiety 
7421.79,just being in a face-to-face conversation. 
7424.1,Some people have a lot of anxiety 
7426.02,"about being physically close to people, "
7427.7,whether or not they know them or not. 
7429.56,"And many people are reactive, "
7431.33,they are in that anticipatory state 
7433.16,of something that is going to happen. 
7434.57,And sometimes this relates to trauma 
7436.25,"and negative experience, but sometimes no, "
7437.96,"sometimes they're just not used to being in dynamic, "
7441.23,"excuse me, exchange with other beings. "
7444.68,"And so, one thing that I love about the movement practice "
7448.16,and how dynamic is that one can explore that space. 
7450.35,Maybe you could talk about that a little bit more. 
7453.56,- Yeah. 
7456.71,"Touch, proximity, all these things, "
7461.27,"also taking very, "
7465.26,"it takes a very, I think, limited place in our lives. "
7468.98,People are not touched and they don't touch enough. 
7472.13,There is certain bubbles of peripersonal space 
7475.55,"according to culture, according to environment, "
7477.92,"what is right, what is wrong? "
7479.21,"And then came all the, of course, political correctness, "
7482.54,"and harassments, and all kinds. "
7485.33,"And this is a problem, "
7486.71,it's a problem to navigate all this scenario. 
7490.19,"And I think we are, "
7491.69,there is definitely this side which is suffering. 
7495.41,"People go to BJJ classes to touch, "
7498.257,not to learn BJJ. 
7500.96,"Most of it, they're not even aware of it, "
7503.15,"before they would go to a prostitute, maybe. "
7508.43,"It would not be honest to say that, "
7513.41,"yeah, this is not required or necessary more in our lives. "
7518.27,"Children who are not touched, "
7519.8,"there is a lot of information about that and the problems, "
7522.68,"but adults who are not touched, "
7524.54,there is not a lot of information. 
7525.89,And I think it's no less of a problem 
7528.02,because it's something that has to be constantly present. 
7532.19,"And then, proximity being able to, as you said, "
7537.32,remove certain reactivity and to learn to control 
7543.41,"that volume control over how reactive I am, "
7547.82,"and in other scenarios, "
7549.14,how do I remove this reactivity altogether 
7551.3,is very important for performance 
7553.07,"and also for our lives for clear thinking, et cetera, "
7556.37,because everything is moving through us 
7558.59,and is being monitored by us 
7561.14,so everything has the potential to detract us 
7563.9,from a certain direction of exploration 
7567.2,"or and if you're reactive, you're a slave, "
7571.048,and it becomes worse and worse and worse. 
7574.52,"Or as, for example, a fighter, "
7576.56,"or a football player, et cetera, "
7578.6,"has to know what to take, what not to take. "
7581.09,The fact that you can sense more 
7582.98,doesn't mean you should react to it. 
7584.48,And the practice helps that 
7586.88,"by bringing people into these scenarios, "
7589.19,but oftentimes disarming them. 
7591.35,"Like when we were working closely today, "
7594.08,and because you have a certain background 
7597.2,"with boxing or fighting, "
7599.33,"I can tell you, you are missing some kind of a way "
7603.65,to be in that space that is not marshaled. 
7607.61,"So, you carry a certain tone, "
7610.34,"although you're a very kind person, "
7612.32,but oftentimes you held me 
7614.81,"without realizing you're holding me with a lot of strength, "
7617.78,"for example, and it just, "
7622.61,it was clear to me you're not fully aware 
7624.89,of what is unfolding 
7625.723,"and it's just, of course, a question of experience. "
7629.42,"So, to be able to be in this scenario, "
7631.04,"but do something else, "
7632.93,"which is not geared towards winning, losing competition, "
7637.04,or just being able to play with another person. 
7639.89,"Like for example, contact improvisation took that "
7642.95,"and played with that, "
7644.237,and the work of Steve Paxton 
7646.04,for the ones who are not familiar. 
7649.67,"So, this is where I call it the hybrids "
7654.05,"become very useful, "
7655.64,"like we don't when you are practicing in this open way, "
7661.04,you are not bound by specific rule set 
7663.74,or ways of doing things. 
7665.0,"It can be a fight, but it can be a dance "
7670.1,a moment after. 
7671.03,Another thing that I learned from capoeira 
7674.18,the situation's very tricky there 
7675.92,'cause I've seen kids doing cartwheels in Brazil 
7679.37,and scissors fall from their pocket. 
7682.97,"Why, why would you go to with a scissor in your pocket? "
7686.96,"Obviously, there is certain intentions "
7689.48,and then at other times you see back flips 
7691.25,"and beautiful things, but people die in capoeira every year. "
7696.95,- Neck breaks or something? 
7698.69,- Kicks through the face from various violence. 
7703.1,"It's I've explored other martial arts and boxing, "
7707.36,"I was involved with MMA and BJJ, "
7710.42,but I tell you the most violent arenas 
7712.49,is that vibe 'cause it's unknown. 
7714.92,"One moment, it smiles, "
7716.57,"another moment, it's something else and it's uncontrolled. "
7718.88,"There is no categories, no weights, "
7720.53,and it's a street phenomenon. 
7722.69,"So, you have musical instruments, "
7724.58,sometimes they break it on your head. 
7726.35,"People don't see that, "
7727.34,but you can look online on YouTube 
7729.47,"and see some of that side of capoeira, "
7731.81,which is actually the day-to-day in Brazil 
7736.34,and the reality and how things unfolded. 
7739.55,"So, it's very important to explore "
7743.21,many ways of being within different distances and spaces 
7747.23,from other people and touched in different ways 
7750.38,and not contextualizing it always in the same way. 
7754.76,"I can touch your chest in one way, "
7757.64,"I can touch it with the exact same pressure and speed, "
7760.67,but it will feel very different. 
7762.95,"The parameters, I'm not sure, certain intentions, "
7766.22,"certain combination of postures or ways, "
7769.46,and this is beautiful exploration. 
7771.191,"And again, I would encourage you and others "
7776.12,to explore the discomfort. 
7778.16,"For example, certain discomfort to be with a man "
7782.213,in a certain scenario or with a woman 
7784.31,and trying to see what is that? 
7786.98,"Because if we're truly strong, "
7789.89,we are not afraid of anything. 
7791.69,If we truly know who we are 
7794.75,"and we are in that exploration, "
7796.97,"we don't know the end result, "
7798.47,but we are in a research 
7800.15,"and then we are not afraid of being in debt or this, "
7803.18,"and we don't come out of boundaries, "
7805.28,and this will improve our culture tremendously. 
7807.77,"Of course, there must be agreement, "
7809.87,"you never force yourself, "
7810.95,but you meet someone who is also interested 
7813.23,in that exploration and then you do it. 
7816.031,And there are many scenarios 
7818.45,"to do that with traditional practices, "
7820.82,like learning to grapple 
7822.62,or going to contact improvisation 
7826.25,"and studying there, or going to dance, "
7828.86,to Latin dance class 
7830.707,"or and there is, of course, my favorite "
7833.27,is to create and to come up with your own hybrids 
7837.62,of that and scenarios. 
7839.72,"Communicating with your loved one through movement, "
7842.51,"not sitting around food and talking, "
7846.17,moving together in all kinds of ways. 
7848.09,"Sometimes it's walking together, "
7850.04,"but sometimes it's all kinds of, it can be game, "
7853.7,"playful, it can be romantic. "
7856.032,"And there are many shades, "
7858.23,"sex doesn't start here and end here, right? "
7861.68,"It's like a continuum, "
7863.09,and we don't even need to define it in that way. 
7866.12,"So, with time, I think it unlocks "
7870.32,a lot of things. 
7871.153,"People become much stronger in a good sense, "
7873.89,"in sense of becoming, being, "
7876.92,"and we abuse less, and we can approach, "
7882.38,"yeah, other aspects to us. "
7885.02,- I love the idea that through the exploration 
7887.3,of a range of physical contacts 
7890.84,provided one knows they can always return 
7893.33,"to their center, so to speak, "
7895.52,then there's a lot of opportunity that opens up. 
7898.7,"I wish there was more of that encouraged in children's play, "
7903.26,"but also, as you mentioned, in adult environments. "
7907.07,"Because yeah, nowadays for all sorts of reasons "
7911.06,"that you've touched on, "
7912.95,the idea of keeping at least in arms length distance 
7915.26,has become critical. 
7916.34,There are a lot of environments 
7917.21,actually where hugging is not allowed. 
7919.91,"I don't know what it's like in Israel, "
7921.5,but in the states many institutions you're not allowed 
7924.41,to touch anyone else's body. 
7926.93,There's actually a wonderful study 
7928.04,"that comes to mind from an Israeli laboratory, "
7930.02,"a guy named Noam Sobel, who's over there, "
7933.92,who has shown that by recording people's first interactions 
7938.51,"that when people meet, if they shake hands, "
7942.5,"they almost always, "
7944.3,I think it's greater than 
85%,of the time 
7946.52,they will then wipe the chemicals 
7948.05,"from the other person onto their own eyes, "
7950.24,typically their eyes or their face. 
7952.4,"This changed a little bit during the whole pandemic thing, "
7955.82,but this is thought to be a carryover 
7959.78,from what other animals do 
7961.01,"in terms of exchanging microbiome elements, "
7963.56,exchanging chemicals that we're constantly feeding 
7966.29,our subconscious with the chemical knowledge 
7970.37,"of the chemical constituents of other people, right? "
7974.24,"So, it goes way beyond how people smell, "
7977.27,"how they look, et cetera. "
7978.83,"More touch seems to me just, as you said, "
7981.83,"provided it's consensual, "
7982.76,it seems like it's just a really good thing overall. 
7985.79,"- And I think maybe also important for discharging, "
7989.87,"discharging certain experiences, remodeling, reframing. "
7993.5,"So, it's like touches, it's very powerful in that. "
7996.622,"If you're touched and you're touching a lot, "
7999.59,you're unpacking and you experience that touch 
8002.56,"that maybe has been traumatic and you're reframing it, "
8006.1,"you have the opportunity, which is something interesting. "
8011.05,I've heard some story 
8014.5,about some traditional culture 
8016.66,"in which when you were burned by mistake, "
8019.69,they would immediately burn you again. 
8023.079,"And it made me think, "
8024.127,and then there would not be any burn marks 
8027.79,"and there would not be the same side effects, "
8030.94,that's the claim. 
8033.01,"It made me think it's like, ""What's the source of this?"" "
8035.38,And I realized that maybe it allows 
8038.26,a certain completion to happen 
8041.05,that in the traumatic moment is not there. 
8044.08,"So, the re-exposure, while you're still open, "
8047.02,"the pores are still open, "
8048.88,allows you to reframe the experience 
8051.4,and then the unfolding of the rest of the event 
8055.06,is very different. 
8056.59,This is if you're touching 
8058.21,"in your practice in the day-to-day, "
8059.8,"and you're working with people, and you're being touched, "
8061.72,"and people come closer, further away, it happens naturally. "
8067.39,"Yeah, and if you pass a certain limit "
8070.18,"and it becomes too much, "
8072.37,"there is always, of course, communication "
8074.44,that has to be present. 
8076.54,"Certain cultures make this communication pre, "
8080.71,certain cultures post. 
8083.35,"The Israeli, for example, post, "
8085.75,here pre. 
8086.98,"- Ah, so in Israel, "
8087.813,"they'll say, ""That didn't feel good to me,"" "
8089.8,"or, ""That felt good,"" or, ""That was fine."" "
8091.93,"- Yeah, it would be more common. "
8095.2,"Here in the airport, "
8096.73,"the guys telling me, ""I'm going to slide my hands "
8099.04,"up towards your crotch until I meet the hard stop,"" "
8103.951,"and then he does this in a way that is supposed to show me, "
8108.07,I have no enjoyment in that 
8110.95,and for me it just feels aggressive. 
8114.07,"But his intention is good, showing me. "
8117.16,"But if it was a loving touch, "
8119.11,"it would be nicer for me actually, "
8121.48,"personally that's it would be gentle, "
8124.6,"but he goes up there and he shows me, "
8126.947,"""I have no enjoyment in this."" "
8129.927,"[groans] That's my testicle right there, "
8133.45,so it's different choices. [Andrew laughing] 
8137.29,"I don't think it's like worse, "
8138.697,but this description can be a bit dissociated. 
8142.39,And what does it make me think? 
8144.01,Is it truly what he feels or not? 
8146.277,"'Cause it feels robotic, so it's not. "
8149.5,"So, sometimes I'd rather not say it "
8151.6,and I'm going to touch your chest 
8154.36,and just place my hand on the chest. 
8157.0,"And, of course I, we can't avoid a problem, "
8161.02,"I'm not suggesting that there is, "
8162.52,but there is an examination. 
8164.14,"And because I moved around and around the world, "
8166.84,I've seen many things 
8167.77,and I've seen benefits here and benefits there. 
8172.18,"And in the practice, I think it's important to discuss this, "
8175.18,"to examine this, I don't have a solution, "
8176.98,but it's something to talk about. 
8179.65,"- It is something to talk about, "
8180.97,and I'm glad you raised it 
8181.93,because I think that it's so clear to me 
8184.54,that much of the value of a movement practice 
8187.42,involves this dynamic interaction with somebody else. 
8189.85,"As you pointed out, it can be performed on one's own "
8192.4,and practiced throughout one's day. 
8194.47,"But the unpredictability is a key element to all of it, "
8199.09,and in bringing out all the potential 
8202.18,that you've described. 
8204.52,In reference to this notion of trauma 
8206.65,and burn and re-burn. 
8208.54,"My colleague at Stanford, David Spiegel, "
8210.49,he works on trauma 
8212.56,"and has actually on this podcast, "
8215.23,he voiced that he's against things like trigger warnings 
8218.11,because of the way that it puts the nervous system 
8219.88,into this state of readiness and reactivity 
8222.58,that can exacerbate problems. 
8225.31,"Whereas, it's very clear from the literature on trauma "
8229.57,and trauma relief that the way to deal with that 
8232.15,"is through a controlled, "
8234.07,but clearly a controlled re-exposure to the trauma 
8237.7,in order to diminish the emotional response over time. 
8240.61,"I mean, it's very clear if we avoid the thing, "
8243.28,obviously we don't want to re-injure ourselves 
8245.14,"or re-traumatize, "
8246.16,but if one avoids the thing that makes them upset 
8248.14,"over and over, all it does is serve to create "
8250.06,"a heightened state of readiness, it primes more trauma. "
8253.18,"- Yeah. - So, I think "
8254.05,it makes good sense. 
8254.95,- I think impressions are very useful here 
8257.98,also when stepping into an area in which trauma can occur. 
8262.3,"And then, by going through the impression "
8266.2,"that it already occurred, "
8267.76,"you create some kind of a thermal layer of protection, "
8272.23,"so I've already been hit when I'm entering that space, "
8276.64,it's so beneficial. 
8278.47,Or I've already been touched in a way that I didn't like 
8281.53,"if I go to a contact improvisation class, "
8283.99,and just running this scenario in your head 
8287.68,"protects so well, yeah. "
8291.16,- I'm glad you mentioned running scenarios in your head. 
8293.14,I've been curious all day as to whether or not 
8295.81,you do visualization 
8297.67,or mental rehearsal of physical movement. 
8301.12,"This is it seems to be a popular idea in the states, "
8304.6,"people are always asking me, ""You know, "
8306.31,can you just imagine a movement 
8308.5,"and learn it better than where you to actually perform it?"" "
8312.43,My hunch based on and my understanding 
8314.62,of the scientific literature is that visualization 
8317.47,can be useful to some extent 
8319.33,"for people that are very good at visualization, "
8321.79,"but for many people, it doesn't help. "
8323.92,And that there's nothing like real physical practice 
8327.43,to improve physical practice. 
8330.67,"- Yeah, the word visualization's not good, obviously, "
8334.63,it has to be experientialization 
8339.19,"in a very complete way, not just visually, of course. "
8343.87,And unless you already developed 
8349.09,"certain experience, tangible experience "
8351.513,"that has benefited from feedback, from outside feedback. "
8357.16,"It is not a very useful thing to do, "
8360.037,and it ends up being fabrications. 
8364.42,But if you are very experienced 
8365.89,and you already gained the benefit of being burnt here 
8369.19,"or overextended here, "
8371.02,then you have a certain experience 
8372.55,"and then you can strengthen certain aspects of it, "
8375.43,but you got to be careful because you do not have feedback. 
8379.33,"And because of the missing feedback, "
8381.07,you might develop delusions. 
8383.14,"It might be that you develop stronger patterning, "
8386.59,but ultimately this would lead you away 
8389.68,from the aliveness of the movement itself. 
8394.39,"Drilling, for example, very useful to learn "
8399.34,a general infrastructure of the movement sleeve 
8403.15,"or the technique, but then to dress it up, "
8406.12,"you need feedback, you need it to be alive, "
8409.48,you need to receive something corrective. 
8414.19,- I love it. 
8415.81,"For many people, they approach movement "
8418.3,"in the form of weight training, or yoga, or running. "
8422.56,"Yoga's a bit more dynamic, "
8424.06,"but it fairly linear types of exercise and movement, "
8429.73,"Peloton, rowing, those kinds of things. "
8433.09,I think most people will probably not depart 
8437.05,from those practices entirely because they like them. 
8439.72,"I'm speaking about myself, "
8441.19,"I like some of those very much, I enjoy them. "
8444.31,But in terms of thinking about adding a movement practice 
8447.73,"to one's already existing exercise regime, "
8452.8,"I can imagine threading it throughout the day, "
8454.39,I can imagine having a dedicated movement practice. 
8456.79,One thing that I have started doing 
8459.76,"on the basis of some of your teachings, "
8461.86,and I just sort of created this idea 
8463.24,is rather than statically 
8464.74,"standing there and lifting weights, "
8465.91,"actually walking from, as I alternate repetitions, "
8468.67,"it occurred to me that I'd never done a curl, "
8472.6,"a bicep curl with one foot in front of the other, "
8475.96,and then I'd never actually switched that up. 
8478.84,And it's kind of an odd stance to be standing in parallel 
8481.42,"and curling one's arm, "
8482.29,it's kind of a ridiculous movement when one thinks about it. 
8484.84,"So, I started incorporating some of that, "
8486.13,"you get some strange looks in the gym, "
8487.57,but I just give them strange looks back. 
8489.76,"So, what are your thoughts [Ido laughing] "
8492.34,about these very linear forms of exercise? 
8494.522,"And, do you encourage people "
8497.8,"to expand the play space, as it were, "
8501.19,for these kinds of exercise? 
8503.05,Or do you think that movement practice is just best explored 
8507.13,"through three dimensionality, "
8510.07,"gravity, and maybe a stick or a ball? "
8513.085,"- Hmm, it's definitely a problem, "
8516.34,and it's approachable. 
8518.17,"People want a quick, people want a hack, "
8520.93,"people want the icing, there is no cake. "
8524.95,"There is no cake, and it's just like industries of icing, "
8528.13,"icing, icing on what? "
8529.81,What are you putting it on? 
8531.31,"So, for me that, that's why I'm going towards this side, "
8536.17,"it's like I have my life, "
8538.12,now tell me what movement practices I should pursue. 
8542.32,"You are movement, "
8544.6,"in essence, you are not thinking of yourself "
8548.17,in any serious way through my eyes. 
8553.0,"There is a dynamic entity to you, "
8556.0,"the body is a huge part of it communicating, "
8559.81,"you have genetic layers, "
8562.57,there is a personalities that got developed 
8565.24,"and built around various influences, "
8567.46,"but then there is also some kind of an essence, "
8569.95,something that reeks from within the cells. 
8573.7,And if you grew up in my family 
8576.46,"and I grew up in your family and it would still be the same, "
8579.7,"and that it's something that I always try to think about, "
8582.52,what is that inside of me? 
8586.48,"So, I think these practices, they're very good, "
8589.36,but they're not designed for the goal 
8592.03,"that we think they were designed to do it, "
8595.81,it orients towards something else. 
8597.4,"For example, yoga, "
8599.38,"there is a good book called the ""Yoga Body"", "
8602.14,which will destroy a lot of people's yoga practice. 
8606.334,"And it goes into how did we get to this yoga, "
8609.61,the influence of Swedish gymnastics 
8612.16,"and Mongolian contortionists, "
8615.94,"and the Western, the West affecting it, "
8620.59,"and then the ancient practice, "
8622.12,"which was barely asana-related, "
8626.23,"posture, position. "
8627.28,"So, actually you said yoga is less linear, "
8629.5,"yoga is very linear, very linear these days, these lines. "
8633.55,"Look at all the traditional dances, "
8635.47,they look like nothing like yoga. 
8638.05,"Look at tai dance, look at Chinese dances, martial arts, "
8642.25,"it's all rounded, it's all curved, "
8643.66,"it's like the like out nature, "
8645.49,what you see in nature and the movement of the animals. 
8649.33,"So, where does it come from? "
8651.82,These are things to understand 
8653.23,"because it designs you now, it shapes you. "
8656.05,You're placing yourself in these forces of change 
8659.62,"and these streams of change, "
8661.51,"and you have a good intention, "
8662.83,"you just want this or that, but the joke is on us. "
8667.09,"And this is the movement practice for me is first education, "
8672.01,let's start to think about this. 
8673.6,"I have nothing that I can just sprinkle now, "
8677.83,some magic powder that will help resolve this 
8681.04,because it's a start of a deep investigation. 
8685.3,"And then, some of the things, let's talk pragmatically, "
8688.51,because what you described 
8690.43,is not about you placing the foot in front 
8692.83,"when you're curling, it's about the examination, "
8696.43,this is why it is a very good direction. 
8700.21,"And then, you will need another one, another one, "
8702.46,don't get stuck on that foot in front of it 
8704.8,and try to do with the eyes closed 
8706.93,"or with a different head posture, "
8708.19,"and you will see things arrive, "
8710.83,"unrelated things because the associative mind, "
8713.98,"the thinking, this relates, "
8715.33,"this doesn't get to the heart of it, never. "
8718.6,"So, just infusing "
8723.22,these elements like in a cup 
8726.07,"will create endless combinations, "
8729.43,"possibilities, and a lot of discovery. "
8731.95,And this for me is humility of the practitioner. 
8734.53,"I don't know, I try like today with you., "
8737.29,I tried various combinations 
8739.72,"and oh, I discover something, "
8741.16,"oh, there is, this is a playful approach, "
8743.35,and this is a researcher approach. 
8746.59,"I don't try to fit my truth into something, "
8749.377,I'm there to examine. 
8751.87,"I don't have a motive yet, why? "
8755.05,"Because I'm fine, I don't depend on that to define myself. "
8759.37,"I'm a human being, "
8760.87,"but if I don't have that sense of worth, "
8762.602,"I'm already like geared towards I need to do this, "
8766.15,"I need to prove this, I have this agenda. "
8768.37,And this is how we get all the lies in the world 
8770.92,and all the problems and difficulties. 
8773.74,"So, these practices, they are related to it "
8777.58,"to prove this, that, this way, "
8780.94,"why we need muscles for X, Y, Z. "
8783.97,And a lot of the reported outcomes 
8789.49,are often from my place is like funny. 
8792.43,I hear about something like I heard you say 
8794.98,about gratitude practice 
8797.56,that actually experiencing from outside 
8801.76,"as somebody else, "
8802.6,or you are receiving gratitude is actually more powerful. 
8806.53,"It's true, but I see why it's true, "
8808.9,I'm not sure everybody sees. 
8810.64,"If somebody tries to feel gratitude, "
8813.34,just sit with the eyes clothes 
8815.56,"or watch a movie and sense the gratitude there, "
8819.16,"it will be clear to you, "
8820.48,one is very difficult to do and the other is very easy. 
8823.84,"Hence, if gratitude is achieved easier this way, "
8826.48,that's why it works like that. 
8828.43,Although all the traditional practices are about you 
8832.36,and by challenging yourself 
8833.92,"to sense that gratitude yourself, "
8836.44,"they achieve much more powerful thing, "
8837.85,but this is not the research people 
8839.763,"and the people in the research, "
8841.54,we don't have a lot of those people. 
8843.49,"So, a lot of the things that can arrive to us, "
8847.33,"weight training, the benefits, "
8849.55,"or the way that the hormonal effect, "
8854.05,"the effect of cognition, et cetera. "
8857.26,"When you open a bit and you go far out, "
8859.72,"you see certain things, not the truth, "
8862.42,but maybe less delusion. 
8865.75,"There is nothing definite, "
8868.0,but there is something 
8871.39,maybe more wholesome that appears. 
8878.5,"Yeah, I think this is so this is a state, "
8882.833,a state of exploration. 
8885.67,"I don't want to have the same thought if I already had it, "
8892.6,why would I want to have the same thought? 
8894.37,I already had it. 
8896.02,"I don't want to have the same practice, "
8898.636,I don't want to. 
8900.13,"I curled already in this way, "
8902.29,"I want to experience something else, I want to. "
8905.08,"There is a benefit to gain, "
8906.67,"No, but that was better. "
8909.61,"The better is better, "
8913.72,"is not more, is not faster. "
8916.39,"It's like better is better, "
8918.58,"and better isn't, we don't know what better is, right? "
8921.343,"So, it's like it's open. "
8923.44,"Oh, this is better, I don't know. "
8925.72,"It's just more weight, it's one more kilo, "
8928.24,"but maybe if I remove one kilo, "
8931.81,"I discover something like, for example, power development "
8937.03,that has been shown to gain certain benefits 
8940.09,when you lighten the load and you accelerated more 
8942.97,"in certain conditions, but who discovered it? "
8945.01,"A practitioner, a math person, "
8948.7,"not Verkhoshansky, Zatsiorsky, "
8951.43,"they reported something, "
8955.0,but it was already within the grasp of the practitioners. 
8959.177,"And I think, and as a researcher, this is very powerful "
8964.63,to remind yourself this and to work with that. 
8967.357,"And as a practitioner, "
8968.41,"as a living human being, for everyone, "
8970.48,I think something very useful. 
8972.64,"And then, those plays that you're doing, "
8977.29,"people give you the weird looks, "
8979.33,"and it's like yeah, I tell people, "
8981.767,"""You don't want to be normal. "
8985.03,"If you don't get the weird looks, "
8986.47,"you're not moving in the right direction."" "
8989.23,You're moving in a very fixed 
8992.98,"and you already know the result of that direction, "
8995.65,let's say at least that. 
8997.48,"So, continue to play with that, continue to play. "
9000.99,"Look elsewhere, look at places you didn't look at "
9003.57,"because this is still like within the same layer, "
9005.52,"one foot in front, one foot behind, "
9007.89,"what happens when you do it with a smile, "
9010.95,"the same workout, and when you do it with a frown? "
9016.26,"Or what happens, breath holding or blood restrictions, "
9020.37,"all this is great play, "
9022.68,"and I think very beneficial to do, to go through. "
9028.069,"- Love it, I think that's a wonderful message. "
9031.11,And what I keep hearing from you over and over again 
9033.33,"is that people should explore, explore, explore. "
9039.12,"And listen, I want to thank you for your time today, "
9044.13,"first of all, for the incredible teachings "
9047.13,"here at this table, "
9048.24,but also the introduction to a movement practice. 
9052.14,"Although, now I'm tempted to say "
9053.22,"that I've been moving my whole life, "
9054.57,I just didn't know I was- - It's true. 
9056.19,- that it was such a vast landscape. 
9059.61,"Also, that your willingness to tread out "
9062.16,in this journey that is truly unique. 
9065.82,"You know, that the greatest compliment "
9067.26,that one can give in science 
9068.58,is the one that I'm going to tell you now 
9070.53,"because it's entirely appropriate, "
9071.79,which is we say you're an n-of-
"1,",right? 
9074.458,"That and you truly are, "
9076.08,I don't think there's anyone 
9078.12,"that has been as willing to embrace existing practices, "
9081.72,"evolve them, create new practices, "
9084.306,and to share so broadly 
9088.05,to really be willing to give and teach so much knowledge. 
9091.14,"You know, earlier you made the mention of your goals "
9093.66,"of in part of being wild and wise, "
9097.47,and I'm here to tell you that you are both wild and wise. 
9101.067,"And so, thank you so much. "
9103.08,"- Thank you very much, thank you. "
