0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
1.97,where we discuss science
3.77,and science based tools for everyday life.
9.27,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
10.28,and I'm a professor of neurobiology
11.84,and ophthalmology at
Stanford,School of Medicine.
15.0,"Today, we are going to discuss the use"
16.85,of deliberate cold exposure
18.5,for health and performance.
20.54,Temperature is a powerful
stimulus,on our nervous system
23.73,and indeed on every organ
and,system of our body
26.81,and cold in particular can be leveraged
29.5,"to improve mental health,"
physical,"health, and performance,"
33.22,meaning for endurance
"exercise,",for recovering
36.37,"from various forms of exercise,"
38.23,for actually improving strength and power
41.48,and for enhancing mental capacity.
43.93,In order to properly leverage
deliberate,cold exposure
46.96,"for sake of mental health,"
physical,"health and performance,"
50.3,you have to understand how cold
impacts,the brain and body.
53.28,So today we are going to discuss that.
55.33,We're going to talk about
some,of the neural circuits
57.08,"and pathways, some of"
the,hormones involved.
59.65,I promise to make it
all,clear and accessible
62.07,regardless of whether or not
63.19,you have a scientific background or not.
65.53,We are also going to discuss
very,specific protocols
68.08,"that you can apply,"
69.2,"which leverage variables like temperature,"
71.36,"how cold, how to deliver"
the,"cold, for instance,"
74.54,"whether or not you use a cold shower,"
76.16,"cold immersion, ice bath,"
circulating,"water, or still water,"
80.98,whether or not you're going
for,walks outside in a t-shirt
83.92,when it's cold or whether or not
85.49,you're purposefully
using,"things like cryo,"
88.12,if you have access to that or not.
90.4,One thing I can promise you
91.36,"is that by the end of today's episode,"
93.54,you will know a lot about the
biology,"of thermal regulation,"
96.63,that is how your brain and
body,regulates its temperature.
100.0,You will also have a lot
of,tools in your arsenal
102.38,that you can use and leverage
104.17,"toward improving mental health,"
105.96,"physical health, reducing"
inflammation,"in the body,"
108.38,"improving athletic performance,"
110.21,improving mental performance.
111.85,I promise to spell out all
those,protocols in detail
114.58,as I go along and to summarize
them,again at the end.
117.52,I'd like to make a point
now,that I'm going to make
119.75,several additional times
during,today's episode
122.56,and that is that temperature
is,a very potent stimulus
126.18,for the brain and body.
127.75,That also means that it
carries,certain hazards
130.41,if it's not done correctly.
132.13,"Now, everyone shows up to the table,"
134.04,"meaning to protocols,"
135.38,with a different
background,of health status
137.42,and there's simply no way that I can know
139.19,what your health status is.
140.79,So anytime you are going
to,"take on a new protocol,"
143.29,that means a behavioral protocol
or,a nutritional protocol
146.73,"or a supplementation protocol,"
148.51,you should absolutely consult
a,board certified physician
151.61,before initiating that protocol.
154.11,"I don't just say this to protect us,"
155.38,I also say this to protect you.
157.7,If you'd like to see
our,"medical disclaimer,"
159.5,you can go to our show
"notes,",it's described there.
161.7,"In fact, I encourage"
you,to please do that.
163.93,"And in general,"
165.24,when embarking on new
protocols,"in particular,"
168.5,if they involve strong stimuli
like,changing temperature
171.46,or placing yourself into
unusual,"temperatures,"
174.73,I would encourage you
to,progress gradually.
176.92,I would also encourage you to not look at
179.26,gradual progression as
the,kind of weak version
182.01,of a protocol.
183.08,"In fact, today I'm going to discuss"
184.6,a really beautiful peer reviewed study
186.94,that involved having people
do,deliberate cold exposure
190.44,so they were immersing
themselves,into water
192.5,up to about their neck
193.85,and the water was actually not that cold.
195.78,"It was only about 60 degrees Fahrenheit,"
197.57,which for most people is pretty tolerable.
199.46,So nowhere near the kinds
of,extreme temperatures
202.12,that one could use in other protocols.
205.32,And the interesting thing is despite
207.08,"that fairly modest cold temperature,"
210.01,by simply extending the duration of time
211.91,"that people were in that water,"
213.42,they experienced enormous
increases,in neurochemicals
216.53,that ought to translate to
improvements,in focus and mood.
220.54,"And indeed, that's what's been observed"
222.65,in subsequent studies.
224.57,"So again, please see"
our,medical disclaimer
226.68,"in our show notes, please"
proceed,"with caution always,"
230.77,please also understand that
the,most potent stimulus
234.65,isn't always the one that you experience
236.54,as the most intense in the moment.
238.27,"In fact, I would encourage you to you find"
239.91,the minimum threshold of stimulus
242.44,that will allow you to
drive,the maximum benefit
245.17,"from each protocol and indeed,"
247.03,I will point out what those
thresholds,ought to be today.
250.58,"I'll give you some simple formulas,"
252.45,gauges or guides that you
can,use in order to navigate
255.66,this extremely interesting and potent tool
258.41,that we call deliberate cold exposure.
260.52,Before we talk about
deliberate,cold exposure
262.39,"and its many powerful applications,"
264.91,I'd like to highlight a study
266.21,"that I find particularly interesting,"
267.89,that I think you will find
269.38,particularly interesting and useful.
271.94,The title of this study
is,brief aerobic exercise
275.34,immediately enhances
visual,attentional control
277.86,"and perceptual speed,"
279.48,testing the mediated role
of,feelings of energy.
283.48,"Now, the reason I like"
this,"study is first of all,"
286.93,it's a fairly large size sample group.
288.98,They looked at 101 students.
292.32,These were college-aged students
and,they had two groups.
295.74,One group did 15 minutes of
jogging,at moderate intensity.
301.49,So they did measure percent
heart,"rates, et cetera,"
304.6,but this would be analogous
to,"zone two cardio,"
308.46,which I've discussed
on,this podcast before.
310.42,Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercise
314.29,that places you at a level where
you,can hold a conversation
318.26,"with a little bit of strain,"
320.1,"meaning that you can get the words out,"
321.48,but every once in a while
you,have to catch your breath
323.44,whereas if you were to push
any,harder by any mechanism
327.02,going faster or on a
steeper,"incline, et cetera,"
330.06,that you would have a hard time
carrying,out a conversation.
332.84,So zone two cardio is a
common,form of describing
337.85,that level of intensity that
they,call moderate intensity.
340.66,So one group did 15 minute of
jogging,"at moderate intensity,"
344.32,which I'm translating to
roughly,zone two cardio.
347.82,The other group did 15 minutes
of,relaxation concentration
352.04,that is somewhat akin to
mindfulness,meditation.
355.32,And then they were analyzed
for,"perceptual speed,"
359.0,"visual attentional control,"
something,"called working memory,"
361.75,which is your ability
362.583,to keep certain batches
of,information online.
366.49,Just imagine someone telling
you,"their phone number,"
368.93,and you have to remember
that,sequence of numbers
370.8,in your head for some period
of,"time, that's working memory."
373.98,And it depends very
heavily,on the so-called
375.92,"prefrontal cortical networks,"
378.01,which are involved in planning and action.
380.01,And they also looked at
people's,feelings of energy
383.14,"and they measured that subjectively,"
384.46,how energetic people felt.
386.1,Now the major takeaways from this study
388.01,that I'd like to emphasize are that
390.23,the 15 minutes of jogging group
392.63,experienced elevated levels of energy
395.32,for some period of time after
they,ceased the exercise
398.93,whereas the group that
did,mindfulness meditation
401.81,actually reported feeling more calm
404.15,and having less overall energy.
406.77,Now that's very subjective
and,indeed they used
408.73,"subjective measures to analyze energy,"
412.08,but what gets interesting is
when,they looked at performance
415.06,on these various cognitive
tasks,and the two tasks
418.76,that they use were called
the,"trail making tests,"
421.38,"they have different versions of this,"
422.7,"version A, version B,"
423.87,"I don't want to go into too much detail,"
425.73,but version A essentially
involves,having a page of numbers
429.96,that are distributed somewhat randomly.
431.9,"So one, two, three, four, five,"
"six,","seven, eight and so on,"
434.26,but distributed randomly across the page
435.95,and people have to use visual search
437.58,to circle those numbers in sequence.
439.51,"So this involves visual attention,"
441.05,"it involves some motor skills,"
443.54,involves a number of things
444.42,that certainly require energy and focus.
447.24,The second test was the
trail,"making test part B,"
450.32,"as I mentioned earlier,"
451.23,and this involved also
circling,"numbers in sequence,"
454.04,but interspersed between
those,numbers were letters.
456.52,So rather than just having
457.91,"to circle off numbers in sequence,"
459.81,"they actually had to connect one,"
461.62,"then the letter A, then two,"
then,"the letter B, et cetera"
464.167,and remember these are randomly
distributed,across the page.
467.44,The major takeaway from the
study,is that the group that did
470.12,the 15 minutes of moderate
exercise,prior to these two tests
475.24,showed significant decreases
in,the amount of time required
478.77,to complete these tests accurately.
481.38,That is interesting and indeed
surprising,"at least to me,"
485.33,because there have been many
studies,looking at the effects
488.13,of mindfulness meditation
on,the ability to focus.
491.2,The key variable in the study
turned,out to be energy.
494.01,This subjectively measured
feeling,I should say
497.6,of having more energy and
thereby,"the ability to focus,"
500.86,especially in these high
cognitive,demand tasks.
503.77,Now the takeaway from
this,study for all of us
505.47,I think is pretty straightforward.
507.33,If you are going to sit
down,to do some work
510.17,that requires focus and working memory
512.57,and cognitive attention
513.62,and especially if it's some
visual,"spatial control,"
516.84,meaning you have to search
for,"things on a page,"
518.46,"you have to organize things on a page,"
519.85,"so some writing, arithmetic,"
521.46,"basically cognitive work of any kind,"
524.65,15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior
528.7,to that work about could
be,very beneficial for you.
531.59,This does not mean that
mindfulness,meditation
533.93,would not be a benefit to you.
535.4,"I wouldn't want you to conclude that,"
537.25,but if you had to choose between doing
538.94,15 minutes of mindfulness meditation
540.89,and doing 15 minutes of moderate exercise
542.85,"prior to a cognitive work about,"
545.68,I would say the 15 minutes
of,moderate exercise would be
549.3,more valuable at least based
on,the data in this paper.
552.27,"In many previous podcasts,"
554.007,I have talked about the
powerful,effects of doing things
557.75,"like mindfulness meditation,"
and,"other forms of NSDR,"
561.89,non-sleep deep rest.
563.0,So these could be 20 minute
naps,or just lying there quietly
565.84,with your eyes closed or yoga nidra
568.0,or NSDR scripts are available on YouTube
571.51,and various other places
free,of cost of any kind.
574.66,"You just go to YouTube, put in NSDR,"
576.53,non-sleep deep rest.
578.67,Those protocols have been
shown,to be very beneficial
581.54,"for enhancing neuroplasticity,"
583.89,the changes in the brain
and,body that encode
587.12,or shift the neural circuits that allow
589.44,"for memory to change,"
591.7,that allow for learning to
occur,after a learning about.
595.76,What I'm referring to today
in,this particular study
598.49,is the use of moderate exercise
600.83,in order to increase
one's,focus and attention
603.95,in order to trigger that neuroplasticity.
606.8,So the simple sequence here
is,"get energetic and alert,"
612.12,"do that prior to the learning about,"
614.22,engage in the cognitive
work,"or learning about,"
616.37,"and then mindfulness meditation,"
618.33,NSDR and so forth should follow.
620.7,And if you would like to access this paper
623.16,and like to look more at
the,"details in the paper,"
625.71,we'll be sure to put a
link,in the show notes.
627.28,The first author is Legrand.
629.21,"And again, the title of this"
paper,is brief aerobic exercise
631.77,immediately enhances
visual,potential control
633.84,"and perceptual speed,"
634.98,testing the mediating
role,of feeling of energy.
637.54,And I also just want to
emphasize,immediately.
640.1,I think most people out
there,are interested in tools
642.15,and protocols that work the first time
643.627,and that work every time
645.02,"and indeed, I think this"
protocol,fits that bill.
647.76,I'm pleased to announce
648.593,that I'm hosting two live events this May.
651.42,The first live event will be hosted
652.95,"in Seattle, Washington on May 17th."
655.63,The second live event
656.58,"will be hosted in Portland,"
Oregon,"on May 18th,"
659.63,both are part of a lecture series entitled
661.64,the Brain Body Contract during
which,I will discuss science
664.94,"and science-based tools for mental health,"
667.1,physical health and performance.
668.577,And I should point out that
while,some of the material
671.32,I'll cover will overlap with
information,covered here
674.01,on the Huberman Lab Podcast
675.407,"and on various social media posts,"
677.46,most of the information I will
cover,is going to be distinct
680.61,from information covered on
the,podcast or elsewhere.
683.5,"So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,"
686.05,Portland on May 18th.
687.37,You can access tickets by
going,to hubermanlab.com/tour
691.48,and I hope to see you there.
692.95,"Before we begin,"
693.783,I'd like to emphasize that
this,podcast is separate
696.0,from my teaching and
research,roles at Stanford.
698.32,It is however part of my desire and effort
700.41,to bring zero cost to consumer
information,about science
703.12,and science-related tools
to,the general public.
705.81,"In keeping with that theme,"
706.99,I'd like to thank the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
709.73,Our first sponsor is Athletic
"Greens,",also called AG One.
713.65,I started taking AG One way back in 2012
716.59,so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
719.01,The reason I started taking AG One
720.69,and the reason I still take AG One
722.43,once or twice a day is that it covers my
724.69,foundational vitamin
mineral,and probiotic needs.
727.86,It also has adaptogens
and,things like zinc
730.31,"for immune system function,"
732.02,but the probiotics are one
of,the key features in there.
734.78,I've done several podcasts
on,"the gut microbiome,"
737.1,which are these trillions of microbiota
738.94,"that live in our digestive tract,"
740.45,and that are crucial
for,"our immune system,"
742.4,brain function and so on.
744.75,One way to enhance our gut microbiome
746.99,to ensure that it's
healthy,is to make sure
748.87,that we get the correct
probiotics,and Athletic Greens
752.39,has the correct prebiotics
and,probiotics that ensure
755.33,a healthy gut microbiome.
756.96,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,"
758.4,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
761.21,to claim a special offer.
762.53,They'll give you five free
travel,packs that make it
764.4,very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
766.11,while you're on the road.
766.98,So in the car and on the plane.
768.48,I should mention the
Athletic,Greens is delicious.
770.41,I love the way it tastes.
771.243,I mix mine with some water
772.655,and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
773.82,The special offer is the
five,free travel packs
776.01,plus a year supply of
vitamin,"D three, K two."
778.93,Vitamin D three has been
shown,to be important
780.94,for a tremendous number
of,biological functions.
783.43,Many of us who get sunlight
get,"enough vitamin D three,"
786.84,"many of us, even if we do get sunlight,"
788.93,do not get enough vitamin D three.
790.86,So the year supply of vitamin
D,"three also has K two,"
793.87,which is important for
cardiovascular,"function,"
795.75,for calcium regulation.
797.4,"Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman"
800.06,to get the five free travel packs
801.4,and the year supply of
vitamin,"D three, K two."
804.07,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by ROKA.
806.42,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
808.52,that are the absolute highest quality.
810.58,The company was founded by
two,All-American swimmers
812.49,from Stanford and everything
about,their eye glasses
814.86,and sunglasses were designed
with,performance in mind.
818.6,Now the glasses were initially designed
820.13,"for athletic performance,"
821.17,meaning they were designed
822.17,to be worn while cycling or running.
823.99,And indeed you can wear them
while,cycling or running.
826.18,"If you get sweaty, they"
won't,slip off your face.
827.89,They're very lightweight.
828.723,"In fact, you hardly ever remember"
that,"they're on your face,"
830.92,at least I can't remember
that,they're on my face.
832.88,I wear the sunglasses when I
"drive,","I wear readers at night,"
836.19,but they're not just for
athletic,performance.
838.23,They have a terrific aesthetic
839.69,so you could wear them to the office
841.16,"or to work or to school, they look great."
843.06,Unlike a lot of high
performance,sunglasses out there
844.97,"that make people look like cyborgs,"
846.21,these you would be happy to wear anywhere.
848.22,"If you'd like to try ROKA glasses,"
849.74,"you can go to roka.com, that's roka.com"
852.95,and enter the code
Huberman,to save 20% off
855.56,your first order.
856.77,"Again, that's ROKA, roka.com."
859.34,Enter the code Huberman at checkout.
861.26,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Helix Sleep.
864.04,Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
866.17,that are uniquely designed
to,your sleep needs.
869.08,Everybody knows the importance
of,"sleep for mental health,"
871.36,"physical health, and performance,"
873.18,but probably what everyone doesn't realize
875.28,"is that you have unique sleep needs,"
877.65,your body and indeed the way you sleep
880.14,need to be matched the correct mattress
881.72,in order to get the best possible sleep.
883.77,Helix understands that and
if,"you go to their website,"
886.71,they have a brief two minute
quiz,that anyone can take
889.25,that will match your body
type,and sleep preferences
891.56,to the perfect mattress for you.
893.45,"So they ask questions like,"
894.51,"do you sleep on your side,"
your,"back of your stomach,"
896.14,or maybe you don't know.
896.973,Do you tend to run hot
or,cold through the night
898.42,or maybe you don't know?
899.66,"I matched to the dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,"
902.17,because I wanted a mattress
903.24,that wasn't too firm nor too soft
904.98,and I've been sleeping on that
mattress,"for over a year now,"
907.35,it's the best sleep I've ever had.
909.04,So if you're interested in
upgrading,"your mattress,"
910.77,"go to helixsleep.com/huberman,"
913.3,take their two minute sleep
quiz,and they'll match you
915.35,to a customized mattress and
you'll,get up to $200 off
918.68,any mattress order and two free pillows.
920.98,They have a 10 year warranty
922.26,and you get to try the mattress out
924.16,for a hundred nights risk free.
926.05,They'll even pick it up for
you,if you don't like it
927.63,although I think you will like it.
928.98,I certainly love mine.
930.18,"Again if you're interested,"
931.23,go to helixsleep.com/huberman to get
933.75,up to $200 off your mattress
order,and two free pillows.
937.6,Let's talk about the use of
cold,for health and performance.
940.58,I confess I love this topic
942.53,because it takes me back
to,my undergraduate years
945.63,when I worked in a laboratory
studying,"cold physiology,"
949.57,its effects on the brain
and,its effects the body.
952.66,"And over the years,"
954.01,I've always kept track of
the,literature in this area
956.78,and indeed there have been
some,"tremendous discoveries,"
959.83,"both in animal models, so in"
rodents,"like mice and rats,"
962.81,but also in humans
964.57,and today we're going to
talk,about both categories
967.1,of studies and I'll be careful
to,point out when discoveries
970.65,were made in animal models
971.92,and when they were made in humans.
975.1,A key point when thinking about
the,"use of cold as a tool,"
979.79,and the key point is that
you,have a baseline level
983.76,"of temperature that is varying,"
986.51,changing across the 24 hour cycle.
989.48,So any use of deliberate cold exposure
992.27,is going to be super
imposed,"on that rhythm,"
996.16,"that circadian rhythm,"
meaning,that 24 hour rhythm.
1000.42,The basic contour of your
circadian,rhythm in temperature
1004.75,is that approximately two hours
before,the time you wake up
1009.55,is your so-called temperature minimum.
1011.92,So your temperature minimum is a time
1014.4,within the 24 hour cycle
1016.2,when your body temperature
is,at its lowest.
1019.9,"So if you normally wake up around 6:00 AM,"
1023.24,your temperature minimum
is,probably about 4:00 AM.
1027.4,"If you normally wake up at about 7:00 AM,"
1030.0,your temperature minimum
is,probably about 5:00 AM.
1033.17,It's not exactly two hours
before,"your wake up time,"
1036.21,it's approximately two hours
before,your wake up time.
1039.25,"Now, as you go from"
your,temperature minimum
1042.7,to the time in which
you're,"going to awake,"
1045.09,your temperature is rising slightly.
1047.97,"And then at the point where you wake up,"
1050.42,your temperature starts
to,go up more sharply
1053.32,and will continue to go up into the early
1056.778,and sometimes even into
the,late afternoon.
1058.6,And then sometime in the
late,"afternoon and evening,"
1061.35,your temperature will start to decline.
1064.75,"And indeed, as you approach sleep,"
1066.71,your body temperature will drop
1068.21,by anywhere from one to three degrees.
1070.76,And in fact that decrease
in,core body temperature
1073.98,is important if not
essential,for getting into
1076.58,and staying in deep sleep.
1079.01,So temperature rises with
"waking,",that's easy to remember.
1082.83,It tends to continue to
rise,throughout the day
1085.59,"and in the late afternoon and evening,"
1087.31,your temperature WILL start
to,go down and the drop
1090.41,in temperature actually
helps,you access sleep.
1093.85,That background or what we
call,baseline circadian rhythm
1098.31,in core body temperature
is,important to remember
1101.16,because it helps us frame both the effects
1104.3,of deliberate cold
exposure,and helps us frame
1108.64,when you might want to use
deliberate,cold exposure
1111.09,in order to access specific states.
1113.6,It also points to times
within,the 24 hour cycle
1116.74,when you might want to avoid
using,"deliberate cold exposure,"
1119.83,if your primary goal is to get to sleep.
1122.72,So that's the circadian
rhythm,in temperature.
1125.59,Now I just briefly want to touch on
1127.57,thermal regulation at the
level,of body and the brain.
1131.09,And this will be very
surprising,to many of you.
1135.26,Let's do what's called
a,"Gedanken experiment,"
1137.51,which is a thought experiment.
1138.96,Let's say I send you
out,into the desert heat
1141.93,for a jog or a run and
it's,"very hot outside,"
1145.65,"102 or 103 degrees, and you start to move,"
1151.36,you start to sweat
1152.26,and of course your core
body,temperature goes up.
1154.9,"Now, then I offer you a cold towel,"
1158.89,"maybe a really, really cold towel"
1161.22,and this towel is saturated with water
1162.85,so you could actually
squeeze,the water out of that
1164.517,and cool your body off.
1166.36,And our Gedanken experiment
is,"for me to say okay,"
1169.43,where are you going to place the towel?
1171.48,How are you going to cool yourself off?
1173.82,And I'm guessing that
most,of you would think
1175.91,that the best way to cool yourself off
1177.59,would be to drape that
towel,"over your head,"
1179.55,"maybe your neck, over your torso,"
1182.04,"that it would feel really, really good,"
1183.32,and it would cool you off.
1185.37,"Well, that's exactly the wrong approach"
1188.26,if you want to cool off.
1189.33,"And in fact, if you were"
to,"use that approach,"
1192.1,your body temperature would
continue,to increase even more.
1196.62,"Yes, even more than had you not placed"
1199.3,that cold towel on your
head,or your torso.
1202.55,And here is why.
1204.5,Thermal regulation meaning
your,brain and body's ability
1207.42,to regulate your internal core temperature
1210.96,is somewhat like a thermostat
and,that thermostat
1213.39,resides in your brain.
1215.17,So if you think about the thermostat
1216.65,"in your home or apartment,"
1218.68,if it's too warm in your home or apartment
1222.6,and you were to take a bag of ice
1224.98,"and to put it on that thermostat,"
1227.64,what would the thermostat do?
1229.09,It would register the
environment,as artificially cool.
1232.67,It would think that the environment
1234.67,was actually much colder than it is.
1237.98,"And so as a consequence,"
1239.78,it would trigger a mechanism
1241.04,to further increase the
temperature,in the room.
1243.67,And you have such a thermostat as well.
1245.54,It's called the medial preoptic
area,of the hypothalamus.
1248.55,The hypothalamus is a small
region,of brain tissue
1252.18,about over the roof of your mouth
1254.11,and a little bit in front of that.
1256.23,So it's basically right behind
your,nose and over the roof
1260.64,of your mouth and it's
a,collection of neurons.
1262.65,Those neurons have a lot
of,different functions
1264.54,that include things like
the,"control of aggression,"
1267.53,"the control of sex behavior,"
1269.24,the control of temperature
regulation,and so on.
1271.73,The medial preoptic area
has,connections with
1275.85,the rest of the brain
1277.29,"or areas within the brain, I should say"
1279.09,"and with many areas within the body,"
1281.51,it receives input from
receptors,in our skin
1286.13,and inside our body that
register,temperature
1289.6,and it acts as a thermostat.
1291.32,So if the surface of
your,"body is made cool,"
1294.58,your medial preoptic
area,will send signals
1298.42,by way of hormones
1300.51,and by way of chemicals that will serve
1302.6,to heat your body up.
1304.68,So what this means is that
if,"you want to cool down,"
1307.28,the last thing you want to
do,is to bring a cold surface
1312.16,"of any kind, towel or splashing water,"
1314.6,to the majority of your body surface.
1316.54,"It might be very, very surprising to you."
1319.107,"And you might say, wait,"
if,"I want to cool down,"
1320.93,I should jump into a cold lake
or,something of that sort.
1322.98,That's a different thing altogether.
1325.53,"What I'll tell you,"
1326.51,and we'll get into this
in,"more depth later,"
1328.32,is that if you really
1329.22,"want to cool down quickly and efficiently,"
1331.36,"you should leverage particular portals,"
1334.81,meaning particular sites on your body
1338.21,where heat can leave
your,body more readily
1341.7,and where cooling can have
a,dramatic and fast impact
1346.13,"on your core body temperature,"
1347.19,can even save your life if
you're,going hyperthermic.
1349.44,We're going to talk more about
the,specific protocols to reduce
1352.67,core body temperature
for,sake of performance
1354.64,and avoiding hyperthermia
later,in the episode.
1357.56,Hyperthermia of course is a
"very,",very dangerous situation
1360.62,because while your body can
drop,in core temperature
1364.21,"somewhat and still be safe,"
1365.86,you can't really increase your
body,temperature that much
1368.5,before your brain starts to cook
1370.05,and other organs start
to,"cook and by cook,"
1372.08,I mean the cells actually start to die.
1374.17,"So you have to be very, very"
careful,with the use of heat.
1376.95,Heat stroke is no joke.
1378.46,People die from heat stroke all the time.
1380.31,You really want to avoid that.
1382.38,One way to avoid that is to
cool,the appropriate surfaces
1386.64,of your body and the appropriate
surfaces,in this case
1390.05,are the upper cheeks
1391.91,"or I would say the upper half of the face,"
1394.56,the palms of your hands and
the,bottoms of your feet.
1396.52,I've talked about this
on,the podcast before
1398.6,and in the guest episode
with,"Dr. Craig Heller,"
1400.93,my colleague in the biology
department,"at Stanford,"
1403.9,"but just very briefly, these surfaces,"
1406.51,"the upper half of the face,"
1408.37,the palms of the hands and
the,bottoms of the feet
1411.12,are what we call
1412.72,"glabrous skin surfaces,"
"G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S,",glabrous.
1418.38,And those surfaces are unique
in,"that just below them,"
1422.71,the vasculature is different
than,elsewhere in the body.
1426.12,Normally the passage of blood goes from
1428.48,"arteries to capillaries to veins,"
1430.64,but just beneath the
glabrous,skin on the bottoms
1434.15,"of the feet, the hands in"
the,"upper half of the face,"
1436.28,you have what are called
arterio-venous,anastomoses.
1439.97,These are portals of
blood,that go directly
1443.02,"from arteries to veins and in doing so,"
1445.53,allow the body to dump heat
more,"readily, more quickly."
1451.95,So as it turns out that if
you,are to cool the palms
1455.25,"of the hands, the bottoms of the feet"
1456.37,"and the upper half of the face,"
1457.47,you can more efficiently
reduce,core body temperature
1460.69,for sake of offsetting hyperthermia
1463.19,and for improving athletic performance
1465.42,and maybe even cognitive performance.
1467.3,So we will return to
the,specific protocols
1469.18,"for doing that later in the episode,"
1471.28,I'll give you a lot of
details,"about how to do that,"
1474.14,how to do that without the use of
1475.68,any fancy or expensive technology.
1478.27,There are some technologies
1479.41,that are now commercially
"available,","for instance,"
1481.93,the so-called CoolMitt
1483.04,that will allow you to do
that,"with maximum efficiency,"
1485.19,but I'll also give you some
at,home methods to do this
1488.48,either in the gym or on runs
or,for sake of cognitive work.
1492.47,So the two key themes again
1494.27,are understand that
baseline,circadian rhythm
1497.58,"in temperature, and understand"
that,the best way to cool
1501.05,the body is going to be
1502.84,by making sure that
something,cold contacts
1507.43,"the bottoms of your feet,"
1508.39,the palms of your hands and
the,upper half of the face.
1510.53,Ideally all three
1511.47,if your goal is to lower core
body,"temperature quickly,"
1513.92,"and again, just cooling"
off,the back of your neck
1517.15,or the top of your head
or,your torso with a towel
1519.39,is going to be the least efficient way
1521.4,to lower core body temperature
and,might even increase
1524.7,body temperature under certain conditions.
1527.5,"With those two points in mind,"
1528.87,we can start to think
about,directed deliberate
1531.3,"cold exposure protocols,"
1532.71,and there are a number
of,different reasons
1534.78,to use deliberate cold exposure.
1536.83,And I want to separate those out for you.
1540.04,There are cold protocols
that,have been tested
1542.85,in peer reviewed studies that are designed
1545.03,to improve mental performance.
1547.17,They are designed to improve
things,like resilience
1549.86,"or your grittiness,"
1550.693,or your ability to move through challenge
1552.55,or to regulate your mind
and,your internal state
1556.31,under conditions of stress
1557.83,and we can define stress
very,specifically as times
1561.32,when adrenaline also called epinephrine
1564.88,and or norepinephrine
also,"called noradrenaline,"
1569.29,are elevated in your body.
1570.6,"Forgive me for the noradrenaline,"
1572.44,"norepinephrine, adrenaline,"
epinephrine,"nomenclature,"
1575.28,I didn't make that up.
1576.5,"It turns out that every once in a while,"
1577.9,"scientists disagree, imagine that,"
1580.1,and you'll get multiple scientists
1581.79,naming the same molecule different things.
1583.81,So epinephrine and adrenaline
are,the same thing.
1586.65,I will use them interchangeably.
1588.39,Norepinephrine and noradrenaline
are,the same thing.
1591.23,I will use those terms interchangeably.
1594.4,Noradrenaline and adrenaline
1596.1,are often co-released
in,the brain and body.
1598.12,So they work as kind of a pair to increase
1601.27,"our level of agitation,"
1602.82,our level of focus and our
desire,and our ability to move.
1607.45,They are often co-released
from,different sites
1610.47,"in the brain and body with dopamine,"
1612.89,a molecule that is commonly misunderstood
1616.71,"as the molecule of pleasure,"
1618.04,but is actually the
molecule,"of motivation,"
1620.35,reward and pursuit.
1622.75,"So dopamine, norepinephrine"
and,noradrenaline
1624.97,tend to be released together
under,certain conditions
1628.22,and today you'll learn how
deliberate,cold exposure
1631.19,can be used to cause increases
in,"the release of several,"
1635.31,"if not, all of these in ways"
1636.93,that can improve your levels
of,attention and your mood.
1641.0,But the key point is that
your,mental state is shifted
1646.74,when you are exposed to
certain,"forms of cold,"
1649.84,and many people use
deliberate,cold exposure
1652.1,specifically to shift
their,body state as a way
1655.73,to train their mental state
so,that they can better cope
1658.93,"with stress in real life and by real life,"
1661.29,I mean when life presents
stressful,"events,"
1663.94,and I will give you specific protocols
1665.8,"as to how you can do that, in other words,"
1667.63,how you can become more resilient
1669.68,through the use of
deliberate,cold exposure.
1672.2,"Now, because of the ways in"
which,deliberate cold exposure
1675.42,can increase this category of chemicals
1677.84,"called the catecholamines,"
1678.92,"that includes dopamine,"
norepinephrine,"and epinephrine,"
1682.82,it can also be used to elevate mood
1685.87,for long periods of time.
1687.74,And I'm going to discuss
a,specific protocol
1690.12,that has been shown to
increase,these chemicals
1693.07,anywhere from 2.5X to
"250%,","to as high as 500%,"
1701.32,five times over baseline.
1703.74,Now you might be asking whether
or,not it is a good thing
1706.33,to raise chemicals like
norepinephrine,and dopamine
1709.18,"to such a great degree,"
1711.17,"whether or not that's healthy for us,"
1712.48,whether or not they can harm us.
1714.1,But it turns out that these
elevations,in norepinephrine
1716.75,and dopamine are very long lasting in ways
1719.82,that people report
feeling,vast improvements
1723.09,in mood and vast improvements
1725.19,in levels of cognitive
attention,and energy.
1728.76,"So by my read of the literature,"
1730.92,these seem to be healthy
increases,in our baseline levels
1735.23,of these chemicals in ways
that,can really support us
1737.76,so I'll give you a protocol for that.
1739.81,"Now, those are some of the mental effects"
1741.76,"of deliberate cold exposure,"
1743.23,but deliberate cold exposure
has,also been studied
1745.5,in animal models and in humans
1747.04,"in the context of increasing metabolism,"
1749.86,even in converting certain fat cells
1752.98,"that we call white fat cells,"
1754.32,"which are the ones where energy is stored,"
1756.12,they're the ones that
we,typically think of
1757.47,"as kind of blubbery fat,"
to,"beige or brown fat,"
1761.56,"which is thermogenic fat,"
1763.33,meaning that it can increase
core,body temperature
1765.42,and serves kind of the furnace
1767.68,by which we increase our core metabolism.
1771.04,"So with a very broad stroke,"
1773.18,I can say that white fat is
generally,the kind of fat
1775.66,that people want less of
and,beige fat and brown fat
1778.61,is generally the kind of fat that
1780.85,if you're going to have fat cells and
1782.81,you certainly need fat
cells,that you want more of.
1785.33,"They are thermogenic,"
they,help you stay lean.
1787.6,They actually serve as a
reservoir,for heating your body up
1790.13,if you're ever confronted
with,a cold challenge.
1792.19,So we're going to talk
about,how to use cold
1793.96,for metabolism as well.
1795.58,"And of course,"
1796.413,people are using deliberate cold exposure
1797.96,"to reduce inflammation post exercise,"
1800.01,to reduce inflammation generally.
1802.71,And people are also using
cold,to enhance performance
1806.55,"in the context of strength training,"
1808.56,in the context of endurance training
1810.16,"and we'll talk about those data as well,"
1812.48,but where I'd like to start
is,with mental performance
1814.97,and I'd like to detail what happens
1818.32,when we deliberately
expose,ourselves to cold.
1821.46,It's key to point out the word deliberate.
1824.65,"If I don't say otherwise,"
then,"throughout this episode,"
1827.64,"if I say cold exposure, I"
mean,deliberate cold exposure.
1830.75,And the reason I point that
out,"is that as my colleague,"
1833.1,"David Spiegel, and the"
department,of psychiatry
1834.74,"at Stanford says,"
1836.17,it's not just about the
state,"that we are in,"
1838.59,it's about the state that
we,are in and whether or not
1840.53,we had anything to with placing
ourselves,into that state
1843.92,and whether or not we did
that,on purpose or not.
1845.92,And what he really means
by,that statement is that
1850.06,there are important effects
of,what we call mindset.
1853.11,Mindset was a topic discussed
in,the guest episode
1856.38,with Ali Crumb some weeks ago.
1858.67,If you haven't seen that
"episode,",I highly recommend it.
1861.27,And the science of my mindset
tells,us that if we are doing
1864.94,something deliberately and we believe
1866.91,"that it's going to be good for us,"
1868.64,it actually can lead to a different set
1871.44,of physiological effects than if something
1875.23,is happening to us against our
will,or without our control.
1878.85,"Now, this is different"
than,placebo effects.
1880.65,Placebo effects are distinct
from,mindset effects.
1883.9,If you want to learn more
about,"that distinction,"
1885.35,please see the episode with Ali Crumb.
1887.3,"But again, when I talk about"
cold,"exposure in this episode,"
1890.36,I'm talking about
deliberate,"cold exposure,"
1893.28,meaning that you are
placing,yourself into a
1896.12,cold environment on
purpose,in order to extract
1898.87,a particular set of benefits.
1902.49,When we talk about deliberate
cold,"exposure, almost always,"
1905.82,that means getting uncomfortable.
1908.1,And one of the most common questions I get
1910.08,when discussing the use
of,cold for sake of mental
1912.7,"or physical performance,"
"metabolism,","et cetera,"
1914.72,is how cold should it be?
1917.34,How cold should the water be?
1918.48,How cold should the environment be?
1920.94,And I just will tell you now
1922.3,and I'm going to say this again and again
1923.76,"throughout the episode,"
1924.593,cause it will continue to be
true,throughout the episode
1926.86,"and long after the episode is over,"
1929.61,"how cold depends on your cold tolerance,"
1932.87,"your core metabolism,"
1934.32,and a number of other features
that,there is simply no way
1938.07,I could know or have access to.
1940.48,So I would like you to
use,this rule of thumb.
1944.62,"If you are using deliberate cold exposure,"
1947.38,the environment that
you,place yourself into
1950.82,should place your mind
into,"a state of whoa,"
1954.29,I would really like to get
out,"of this environment,"
1956.84,but I can stay in safely.
1959.44,Now that might seem a
little,"bit arbitrary,"
1961.26,but let's say you were
to,get into a warm shower
1963.61,"and it would feel really, really nice"
1965.16,and you were to start
turning,down the warm
1967.12,and turning up the cold.
1968.4,There would be some threshold at which
1970.35,it would feel uncomfortable to you.
1972.6,And if you were to continue
to,make a little bit colder
1974.8,"than that, you would really"
want,"to get out of the shower,"
1977.61,but you are confident
that,you could stay in
1980.17,"without risking your health,"
without,risking a heart attack.
1984.08,Now that's very different
than,jumping into
1985.87,"a very, very cold lake or"
1989.2,I've seen these images of
people,that will cut holes into
1992.78,frozen over lakes and they'll
get,into that cold water.
1996.04,If you are trained to do that
1997.24,and you have the right
"conditions,","et cetera,"
1999.17,"that can be done reasonably safely,"
2001.27,but that's certainly not
what,I would start with.
2003.77,"And for many people,"
that,would be too cold
2005.74,and indeed some people
can,go into cold shock
2008.67,and can die as a consequence of getting
2010.17,to that extremely cold water very quickly.
2012.25,Now that's not to scare you away
2013.45,from deliberate cold exposure.
2014.88,It's just to say that there's
no,simple prescriptive
2018.3,of how cold to make environment
2019.84,in order to extract maximum benefit
2023.25,for mental or physical performance.
2026.26,So the simple rule of thumb is going to be
2029.27,place yourself into an environment
2031.15,"that is uncomfortably cold,"
2033.59,but that you can stay in safely.
2035.33,And you'll have to experiment
a,"bit and that number,"
2037.98,"meaning that temperature,"
will,vary from day to day.
2040.22,It will vary across the 24 hour cycle
2043.46,"because of that endogenous,"
2045.29,"meaning that internal rhythm,"
2046.92,in temperature that I
talked,about earlier.
2049.25,"Low early in the day,"
2050.19,"rises into the afternoon, drops at night."
2052.49,You can actually do this
experiment,if you like.
2054.9,Try getting into a cold
shower,at 11 o'clock at night
2057.73,if you want versus try doing it
2060.52,in the middle of the afternoon.
2062.02,It's quite a different experience
2064.137,"and by quite a different experience,"
2065.62,I mean it requires quite a
different,degree of resilience
2069.63,and leaning into the practice.
2071.11,Your willpower will have
to,be higher I suspect
2075.65,late in the day as it
compared,"to early in the day,"
2079.84,but that will vary of course
between,individuals as well.
2082.73,So the most common question I get
2083.99,about deliberate cold exposure
2085.31,is how cold should the water be?
2088.11,And we've answered that with
uncomfortably,cold to the point
2091.25,"where you want to get out,"
2092.083,but you can safely stay in.
2093.81,The second most common question I get
2095.52,about deliberate cold
exposure,is whether or not
2097.88,"cold showers are as good,"
2099.5,better or worse than cold water immersion
2102.5,"up to the neck, for instance."
2104.3,I also get a lot of questions
about,whether or not
2106.36,cryo chambers are better
than,"all the others,"
2108.95,"et cetera, et cetera."
2110.3,I'm going to make all of that
2112.02,very simple for you by
saying,cold water immersion
2114.97,up to the neck with your
feet,and hands submerged also
2118.27,is going to be the most effective.
2120.97,Second best would be cold shower.
2123.74,Third best would be to go outside
2126.05,with a minimum amount of
"clothing,","but of course,"
2129.48,clothing that is culturally appropriate
2132.1,and that would allow you to
experience,cold to the point
2135.58,where you would almost want
to,shiver or start shivering.
2138.47,"Now there are a number of different,"
2140.06,important constraints
that,are going to dictate
2142.41,whether or not you use
one,form of cold exposure
2144.58,or the other.
2145.42,"For instance, some"
people,don't have access
2147.01,to cold water immersion.
2148.04,They don't have access to ice
baths,"or cold water tanks,"
2153.2,"cold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera."
2155.22,"In that case, showers would"
be,the next best solution.
2158.8,I do want to emphasize that
there,"have been very few,"
2161.21,"if any, studies of cold showers,"
2164.41,and you can imagine why
this,would be the case.
2167.25,"In a laboratory,"
2168.083,you want to control for as
many,variables as possible.
2171.01,So placing people into a cold
water,immersion or an ice bath
2176.16,up to the neck and insisting
they,keep their hands
2178.37,and feet under is very easy to control.
2181.27,It means that everyone can
do,essentially the same thing
2183.62,"whereas with cold showers,"
2185.16,people are different sized bodies.
2187.32,Some people are going
to,put their head under.
2188.62,Some people are going to lean forward.
2191.29,Measuring the amount of cold
water,exposure on the body
2194.02,is very hard to do
2195.23,and so there aren't a lot
of,"studies of cold showers,"
2198.27,"but of course,"
2199.43,a lot of people don't have
access,to cold water immersion
2201.72,so they have to use cold showers.
2203.42,And if you don't have
access,"to both, of course,"
2205.43,then going outside on a cold
day,can be of a benefit.
2209.55,But I will point out
that,the heat transfer
2213.44,"from your body into water is much higher,"
2217.02,"four times greater, if not even greater,"
2220.76,"depending on the temperature of the water,"
2222.44,in water as opposed to in air.
2224.41,So it's going to be much more efficient
2225.93,to do cold water immersion
than,"anything else,"
2227.81,cold showers after that
and,put yourself into
2230.65,a cold environment would
be,the third best thing.
2233.44,I'm not going to get into cryo chambers
2235.03,because they carry quite
a,high degree of cost.
2238.27,"And again, there aren't"
many,studies of them.
2240.66,"So if you have access to cryo chambers,"
2243.1,I'm sure that the cryo chamber facility
2244.78,has told you about all
these,incredible benefits
2246.38,and I don't doubt that some
of,"those benefits truly exist,"
2249.08,but most people just
don't,have the resources
2251.38,or the access to those
2252.42,so we're going to leave cryo chambers
2253.67,out of today's discussion.
2254.98,And of course I realize
there's,a fourth category
2257.12,of cold exposure out there.
2258.44,People are wearing ice vests.
2259.9,"Believe it or not, those"
"exist,",ice underwear.
2261.92,"Yes, those exist."
2264.37,You can look for them
on,Amazon if you like.
2266.79,They are putting cold
packs,in their armpits
2269.38,or in their groin or elsewhere in order to
2271.68,stimulate some of the effects of cold
2274.52,on mental and physical performance.
2276.82,I'm not going to address those
in,too much detail today.
2279.97,"They can be efficient in certain ways,"
2282.46,but as you'll learn about
later,"in the episode,"
2284.94,"cooling the palms, the upper face"
2287.5,and the bottoms of the feet
2288.65,is going to be far more efficient
2290.45,and unfortunately I think most
of,the people that are using
2293.45,ice packs to increase
their,core metabolism
2295.41,are not aware of the glabrous skin cooling
2298.47,"and how it can be a very,"
very,potent stimulus
2300.86,so we'll return to that later.
2303.13,"Unless I say otherwise,"
2304.4,I'm mainly going to be focusing
on,cold water immersion
2306.877,and cold showers.
2308.05,So let's talk about protocols
for,enhancing mental health
2310.84,and performance using
deliberate,cold exposure.
2314.5,What happens when we get into
cold,is that we experience
2318.82,"an increase in norepinephrine,"
2321.48,in noradrenaline release
and,in adrenaline release.
2324.55,The fact that cold
"exposure,","deliberate or no,"
2327.22,increases norepinephrine and epinephrine
2330.19,in our brain and body means that it is
2332.53,a very reliable stimulus for increasing
2334.67,norepinephrine and epinephrine.
2336.59,"That's sort of an obvious statement,"
2338.44,but that obvious
statement,can be leveraged
2342.07,to systematically build up
what,we call resilience.
2345.58,"Now, when we experience"
a,"stressor in life,"
2348.71,whether or not it's something bad happens
2350.85,in our relationship or something
bad,happens in the world
2354.27,"and we feel stress,"
2356.39,that stress is the
consequence,of increases
2358.5,in norepinephrine and epinephrine
in,our brain and body.
2362.01,"Very similar, if not identical,"
2363.7,to the kinds of increases
2364.76,that come from deliberate cold exposure.
2367.23,So deliberate cold
exposure,is an opportunity
2369.99,"to deliberately stress our body and yet,"
2373.51,because it's deliberate
2374.56,"and because we can take certain steps,"
2376.05,"which I'll describe in a moment,"
2378.39,"we can learn to maintain mental clarity,"
2381.88,we can learn to maintain
calm,while our body
2385.73,is in a state of stress.
2387.54,And that can be immensely useful
2389.84,when encountering stressors
in,other parts of life.
2393.32,And that's what we call
resilience,"or grit,"
2395.58,"our ability or mental toughness,"
2397.52,our ability to lean into
challenge,or to tolerate challenge
2401.61,while keeping our heads
"straight,",so to speak.
2404.2,So one simple protocol
for,increasing resilience
2407.73,is to pick a temperature
that's,uncomfortable
2410.45,"of shower or cold immersion,"
2412.57,and then to get in for a
certain,duration of time
2415.87,and then to get out.
2417.24,"Now, it's important to understand"
2418.27,that people will
experience,different levels
2420.19,of norepinephrine and adrenaline release
2422.36,when getting into cold water.
2424.2,"Some people, because they"
dread,"the cold so much,"
2428.01,will actually experience norepinephrine
2429.777,and epinephrine increases
2431.08,even before they get into the cold water
2433.61,or under the cold shower.
2435.15,Now you may have experienced this.
2436.27,I've certainly experienced this.
2437.93,"I'm dreading it, I don't want to do it"
2439.45,and I have to force myself to do it.
2441.86,And indeed epinephrine and
norepinephrine,and its surges
2445.61,can be thought of as sort of
walls,that we have to confront
2448.92,and go over.
2449.96,And I'd like you to
conceptualize,"them that way,"
2452.06,because it allows us to build protocols
2454.61,that can be very
objective,and can allow us
2458.12,to monitor our progress in
terms,of building resilience.
2461.28,"So one option is to simply say, okay,"
2464.17,I'm going to force myself
2465.32,to get into the cold
shower,for one minute.
2467.75,"How cold, again, uncomfortably cold,"
2469.39,but you can stay in safely
2470.46,or I'm going to get into
the,ice bath for one minute.
2473.72,Ice baths are very cold inevitably.
2476.86,And what is also inevitable is that
2479.48,"when you get into the cold,"
2480.91,you will experience a surge
2482.4,in epinephrine and norepinephrine.
2484.13,That's non-negotiable
because,it's mediated
2486.71,by cold receptors on
the,surface of your body
2489.29,and your skin and the way
that,they trigger the release
2492.1,"of norepinephrine and epinephrine,"
2493.61,"not just from the adrenals,"
2495.3,from the adrenal glands
above,"your kidneys,"
2497.27,"but also from regions of your brain,"
2498.82,"like the locus coeruleus,"
2499.99,which cause increases in
the,"tension and alertness,"
2502.94,and from other locations in
your,body where epinephrine
2505.727,and norepinephrine are released.
2507.15,"In other words, cold is"
a,non-negotiable stimulus
2511.8,for increasing epinephrine
and,norepinephrine.
2515.14,Even if you are the
toughest,person in the world
2518.01,"and you love the cold,"
2520.36,that increase in epinephrine
and,norepinephrine
2522.56,is going to happen.
2524.07,So the way to think about
norepinephrine,and epinephrine
2526.75,in this context of
building,mental resilience
2529.25,is that you have two options.
2531.48,You can either try to
extend,the duration of time
2535.37,that you are in the
deliberate,cold exposure.
2537.48,So going from one minute to
75,seconds to two minutes
2541.01,and so on over a period of days
2543.44,or one way to approach this
2545.837,and the way that I particularly favor
2547.87,is to take the context of the day
2550.747,"and the moment into account,"
2552.61,meaning we have different
levels,of grit and resilience
2556.3,on different days and
depending,on the landscape
2558.73,"of our life at the time,"
2559.78,even the time of day that
we're,doing these protocols
2562.12,and start to be able to sense
the,"release of epinephrine,"
2567.809,and norepinephrine in our
brain,and body and see those
2570.41,as walls that we want to climb over
2572.52,in order to build resilience
and,to start counting
2575.32,the number of walls that we traverse
2577.95,and the distance between those walls
2579.79,as we do deliberate cold exposure.
2581.73,Let me give you an example
of,the timed protocol
2585.29,"because that one is very straightforward,"
2586.89,although I do not think it is as powerful
2589.6,for building mental resilience.
2591.05,"The time protocol would be Monday,"
2592.92,I do one minute of
deliberate,cold exposure
2595.35,at a given temperature.
2596.19,"Wednesday, I extend"
that,"by 50% and Friday,"
2599.34,I do deliberate cold
exposure,for twice as long
2602.38,as I did it on Monday.
2603.85,"And if I were to continue that every week,"
2606.24,"Monday, Wednesday, Friday,"
2607.1,I would continue to either
increase,the duration
2609.53,or I would lower the temperature
and,"reduce the duration,"
2614.16,"this kind of thing, very much"
like,sets and reps in the gym.
2616.52,Now that option is very objective.
2618.71,You could even log it in a book
2620.3,and as you develop the ability
to,"stay in cold temperatures,"
2626.16,even progressively colder
and,colder temperatures
2628.2,"for longer and longer periods of time,"
2630.23,you will become more resilient.
2632.47,What do I mean by that?
2633.66,"Well, my operational"
definition,of resilience
2635.64,is that you are able to resist
escape,"from the stressor,"
2639.16,"the cold, by virtue of your willpower,"
2642.91,which is really your prefrontal cortex
2645.8,causing top down control on your reflexes
2648.83,and your limbic system
and,"your hypothalamus,"
2650.83,which are basically telling you
2651.87,"to get out of that cold water,"
2653.96,get out of that cold
environment,"and in doing so,"
2657.54,you are basically getting better
2659.07,at controlling your behavior
when,your brain and body
2661.89,are flooded with
norepinephrine,and epinephrine.
2664.04,That's a very reductionist
way,to explain resilience
2666.63,"or grit or mental toughness,"
2668.14,but it's a reductionist
way,of explaining it
2670.53,that is very closely
tied,to the biology end
2672.55,of the psychology.
2673.67,And it is a fact that
norepinephrine,and epinephrine
2677.71,release in the brain and body
2679.2,are the generic universal
code,for stressor.
2683.55,There is no unique chemical signature
2685.52,for different forms of
"stressors,","that is the only one,"
2688.43,although of course there are
2689.263,other chemicals involved as well.
2690.86,So you could go for time and you could try
2692.78,and reduce the temperature
and,increase the time
2695.47,over a period of days or weeks.
2697.48,Now that's an attractive
way,"to approach things,"
2700.05,but the problem is that you
don't,have an infinite amount
2703.79,"of room with which to lower temperature,"
2706.04,because eventually you
will,get into temperatures
2708.14,that are either so cold
that,they are dangerous
2710.9,or you have to stay in cold temperatures
2713.39,for such long periods that
it,becomes impractical
2716.98,because presumably you also have to
2718.97,"take care of other aspects of your life,"
2720.49,you can't just sit all
day,in the ice bath.
2723.06,"Now for that reason,"
2724.27,I favor a protocol in which
you,build mental resilience
2727.64,and mental toughness through
2729.49,two different types of protocols.
2731.09,The first one involves counting walls.
2733.42,"Now, what do I mean by walls?"
2734.43,"I mean the sensation of, no,"
2737.21,I don't want to do this and
the,idea or the sensation
2741.32,in your brain and body that
you,actually want to leave
2743.71,that environment and go warm up.
2745.56,"Now again, for some people,"
2746.72,that will be even before
getting,into the ice bath
2749.16,or cold shower.
2750.11,So if you are feeling very resistant
2752.74,to getting into the ice bath
2754.04,"or cold shower and you manage to do that,"
2756.34,that's going over what
I,would call one wall.
2760.21,"Then for some period of time,"
2761.69,you might actually feel
comfortable,"in the ice bath,"
2765.6,cold water or cold shower.
2767.8,And you feel like you could stay there
2769.56,"for some period of time,"
2770.45,that you could stay there
for,"a minute or two minutes,"
2772.3,"but inevitably, the next wall will arrive."
2775.89,And I would encourage
you,to pay attention to
2777.87,when that next wall arrives
2779.33,"and actually having an awareness,"
2781.0,that so-called interceptive
awareness,"as we call it,"
2784.38,of when that next surge
adrenaline,epinephrine comes
2787.69,or whether or not it
reaches,a certain threshold
2790.37,in your brain and body that
you,feel you want to get out
2792.44,and you're able to stay in for
even,"just 10 seconds longer,"
2796.27,that means you've
traversed,yet another wall.
2799.29,And if you continue to stay
in,"that cold environment,"
2802.19,you'll find that the next wall will come
2803.907,and the next wall will come.
2805.07,"Now eventually of course,"
you,"will get very, very numb"
2808.3,depending on how cold it is
2809.4,and you could also place
yourself,into danger.
2811.22,"So you have to maintain cognitive control,"
2814.05,"counting these walls,"
traversing,"these walls,"
2816.3,"but getting out at some point, of course."
2819.16,So my favorite protocol for
building,mental toughness
2823.89,"AKA grit, AKA resilience,"
2826.24,"is to take into account that some days,"
2828.37,just getting into the ice bath
2830.15,or cold shower represents a
"wall,",some days it doesn't.
2832.68,Some days you get in and you
feel,"you could go 10 minutes,"
2835.74,other days you get in and you feel like
2837.09,you could only go a minute and
setting,a designated number
2840.46,of walls before you start the protocol
2843.01,is going to be very beneficial here.
2844.68,"So you say, as long as I can do it safely,"
2847.09,I'm going to do three walls today.
2849.4,The first wall is getting in.
2850.53,The second wall will
arrive,when it arrives
2852.8,and the third wall will
arrive,when it arrives
2855.41,and I'll get over that
wall,and then I'll get out.
2857.13,"The next day, you might do five walls."
2858.73,"The next day, you might"
do,"three walls again,"
2861.96,but you might lower the temperature.
2863.53,This gives you tremendous flexibility
2865.92,and indeed it gives you much more latitude
2868.84,to be able to use the same
temperatures,"in different ways,"
2872.52,or to reduce the temperature
only,a little bit
2874.74,"and still get a lot of stimulus,"
2876.8,meaning a lot of results
out,of a given protocol.
2880.17,Whereas people who are just
going,for temperature and time
2882.9,eventually become cold adapted.
2884.95,"They get very, very good"
at,doing three minutes
2887.8,or six minutes or even 10
minutes,at a given temperature
2890.76,and so then they feel like they have
2892.14,to lower the temperature
even,more and even more
2894.53,and eventually they just bought them out.
2896.29,There's nowhere else to go.
2897.32,There's no way to get
improvements,out of the protocol.
2901.14,At least not in terms
of,mental resilience.
2904.28,"Of course, there's still"
the,positive effects
2906.61,"on inflammation and metabolism, et cetera,"
2908.63,that we'll talk about in a little bit.
2910.84,But the key thing here
is,to design protocols
2913.54,that are going to work for you over time
2915.63,"and for you very, very hardy,"
2917.41,"very, very tough guys and gals out there"
2919.55,that can get right into
2920.68,"an ice bath or a very, very cold immersion"
2923.12,and you can just grind it
out,"for six or 10 minutes,"
2925.53,or you can even do that
by,"remaining peaceful,"
2928.73,"well more points to you, but guess what?"
2931.1,That's the equivalent of
already,having loaded up
2933.27,the barbell with 600 pounds
and,done your 10 reps.
2936.36,There's not a whole
lot,more variable space
2939.0,with which to get benefits
from,that stimulus.
2942.33,"And in the weight room,"
2943.44,people understand that you
can,"adjust, for instance,"
2945.33,"the speed of the movement,"
2946.51,or you can start combining that movement
2948.01,"with pre-exhaustion, et cetera."
2949.66,"With cold exposure,"
2951.1,you don't have as much
variable,space to play with.
2953.62,"So if your goal is to build resilience,"
2955.71,either go for time as a
function,"of temperature,"
2958.56,or what I suggest is to
start,recognizing these walls
2963.25,as an experience of resistance in you
2965.9,"and going over those walls,"
set,a certain number of walls
2968.85,that you're going to go over
on,a given day and do that
2971.84,"at a given temperature,"
and,then to mix it up.
2974.68,And ideally you might even
throw,in one more wall
2978.45,"at the end,"
2979.283,if you're really feeling bold and brave
2981.11,because that's going to
build,out further resilience.
2983.46,But if you want cold
exposure,to work for you
2985.5,for sake of building up resilience
2986.93,"and mental toughness over time,"
2988.51,you're going to want to
vary,this parameter space
2991.38,in some sort of way.
2992.75,And you don't have to be
super,systematic about it.
2996.1,That's the beauty of this kind of approach
2998.35,because you're relying on the fact
2999.93,that those walls really represent times
3002.9,in which you are forcing
your,"top down control,"
3005.41,your prefrontal cortex to
clamp,down on your reflex
3008.15,and you're learning behavioral
control,in the context
3011.05,of your body having elevated levels
3012.98,"of these catecholamines,"
norepinephrine,and epinephrine.
3015.55,And that translates to real life
3017.5,in a much more realistic way I
believe,"because in real life,"
3021.56,you're not really engaging in stressors
3024.33,for a given amount of time
3026.27,that you know how long it's going to last
3028.04,"and you know the context, no."
3029.46,Most stressors arrive
in,the form of surprises
3031.83,"we don't like, text messages"
that,"deliver bad news,"
3034.85,information about the
outside,world or real world
3037.53,and online interactions
that,send our system
3040.01,into a state of increased
norepinephrine,and epinephrine.
3042.85,And if you start to
think,of those as walls
3044.66,that you can tolerate and climb over
3046.1,"while staying and calm and clear of mind,"
3048.5,then you can really
imagine,how the ice bath
3052.18,and other forms of cold
exposure,are really serving
3055.0,to train you up for real life stressors.
3058.07,The next question that I always get is
3060.25,what should my mental state be
3062.22,while I'm exposing myself
to,"this uncomfortable,"
3064.94,yet safe condition of cold?
3067.68,"Well, you have two options"
3069.59,and there are probably
other,options as well.
3071.49,One is to try and calm yourself
3074.01,to remain as mentally still as possible.
3077.68,The other is to lean into that challenge
3081.15,"and so to grind it out and here,"
3083.42,I have to say that this is
a,lot like teaching someone
3085.75,to drive on a gravel road.
3087.41,For any of you that have
driven,"on a gravel road,"
3089.9,you know that there is no optimal speed
3092.87,for all gravel roads.
3093.99,It depends on the density
of,"the gravel, et cetera,"
3095.937,"and the vehicle, et cetera."
3097.76,"So for instance, on some gravel roads,"
3100.14,when you start to drive and
the,"dust starts to kick up,"
3102.99,your best option is to drive fast
3104.7,and put that dust cloud behind you.
3106.74,"On other gravel roads,"
if,"you try and do that,"
3109.12,the dust actually kicks
up,around the vehicle
3110.8,and it makes it hard to see
3112.02,and sometimes you have to slow down.
3113.96,The same thing is true for getting through
3115.81,deliberate cold exposure.
3117.52,Sometimes it's easier to calm yourself.
3119.53,One way to do that is
through,double inhales
3121.73,through the nose and extended
exhales,"through the mouth,"
3124.0,or simply by trying to
control,your breathing
3126.77,and reduce the pace of
your,breath and increase
3129.74,the volume of your breathing.
3132.37,I have to say that everyone
experiences,a shortening
3135.42,of breath when they get into
uncomfortably,"cold water,"
3138.34,that is a universal
physiological,response.
3141.62,Everyone also experiences
a,30 to 80% decrease
3146.21,"in cognitive function, in"
"particular,",the frontal cortex.
3149.43,The metabolism of your
frontal,"cortex goes down,"
3151.44,the metabolism meaning the
activity,of brain areas
3154.44,associated with stress
and,panic goes way up.
3156.97,And so anchoring your mind
in,cognitive activities
3161.4,"as you get into the cold can be very,"
3163.22,very helpful for
maintaining,clarity of mind.
3166.86,"In fact, one thing that"
I,sometimes recommend
3168.82,is that people try and engage
3170.69,in some sort of cognitive
exercise,"while in the cold,"
3173.72,"not as a form of distraction,"
3175.61,but as a way to maintain
clarity,of thinking
3177.64,and to learn how to do that
when,the body is flooded
3179.89,with all these chemicals
that,make us stressed.
3182.29,"So for instance,"
3183.123,you could do math problems and
not,"two plus two equals four,"
3186.05,"not three times three equals nine,"
3188.25,but things that require
a,little bit more focus
3190.74,and attention working memory and so forth.
3193.38,You could also start to have thoughts
3196.47,that you deliberately impose
a,full sentence structure on.
3200.6,That's actually quite tough.
3202.14,You could try and recall
specific,bouts of information
3205.32,that are challenging.
3206.153,This is teaching your
mind,"how to stay online,"
3209.28,"or rather I should say,"
3210.113,this is you teaching
your,"prefrontal cortex,"
3212.49,how to stay engaged while you
have,high levels of stress
3215.88,in your body.
3216.88,"Years ago, I had a friend who works"
3219.29,"in the neuroscience world,"
research,"neuroscientist,"
3222.49,who was obsessed with
this,very bizarre sport
3225.72,"that I don't necessarily recommend at all,"
3227.7,which is the combination
of,boxing and chess.
3230.63,You may have seen this on YouTube
3231.84,"where people will box around,"
3233.28,"legitimate boxing around,"
they're,sparring all out often.
3236.54,"And then at the end of the round,"
3238.22,"instead of resting in the corner,"
3239.31,"they actually sit down and play chess,"
3241.03,and then they go back to
boxing,and back to chess.
3243.1,"Again, not a sport that I recommend,"
3245.59,but the reason he was
obsessed,with this is because
3248.11,he studies the impact of stress
on,cognitive performance.
3251.41,And what that particular
very,bizarre sport was doing
3254.37,was toggling back and forth
3255.63,between different states of mind.
3257.61,Now it's used both to
increase,cognitive clarity
3262.09,"for the fighter when they box,"
3263.63,because staying calm and clear thinking
3265.46,is very important to
winning,boxing matches.
3267.75,"Believe it or not, it's"
not,an all outrage.
3269.81,It's a very calculated
game,of mental chess
3272.22,and physical chess
that's,quite high stakes
3274.57,as you can imagine.
3276.53,It's also used in some circles
as,a way to teach people
3280.73,how to engage in cognitive performance
3282.67,when their body is simply
filled,to a stress.
3284.39,"So in the boxing chess example,"
3286.87,the replacement for the cold
water,"is actually the boxing,"
3290.4,it's the thing that's
supposed,to induce the stress
3292.31,cause getting hit is
stressful,and the risk
3294.59,of getting hit is
stressful,for most people.
3297.0,"So again, if you think about"
deliberate,cold exposure
3300.74,as a way of just
systematically,and reliably
3303.4,inducing epinephrine and
norepinephrine,release
3305.45,"and delivering stress,"
3307.04,well then this idea of
maintaining,cognitive clarity
3309.75,and actually engaging in cognitive tasks
3311.64,while in the ice bath or cold shower
3314.29,can actually be very beneficial.
3315.65,Even though it might
sound,"a little bit silly,"
3316.98,you are really training up your ability
3318.67,to keep your brain working
3320.43,when the reflex is to shut
down,the parts of your brain
3324.2,that are involved in deliberate
planning,and thinking.
3326.34,Now another important aspect
of,deliberate cold exposure
3329.33,"that I rarely if ever hear discussed,"
3332.29,but is vitally important is whether or not
3335.51,you move around or not.
3337.71,And here's the reason.
3338.9,When you get into cold
water,and you remain there
3343.3,"for some period of time,"
3344.28,your body is generating
heat,and that heat generates
3347.71,what's called a thermal layer
3349.38,that surrounds your entire body.
3352.27,"So if you stay still,"
3354.41,you are actually warmer
than,"if you move around,"
3357.27,you can try this the next time
3358.47,you're doing your
deliberate,cold exposure.
3359.96,"If you're submerged up to the neck,"
3361.22,"sit there for about 10, 30 seconds"
3363.68,"and be very, very still of body."
3365.51,"In fact, this is the way"
that,most people start
3367.82,to do deliberate cold exposure.
3369.13,They give this very stoic look.
3370.46,"They don't blink, they look very peaceful."
3372.0,Some of them even look tough
3373.81,"or they make a very even A, emotional face"
3377.8,"and so it looks like they're really tough,"
3380.19,but they are so still
that,"believe it or not,"
3382.41,they're not providing
the,most potent stimulus.
3386.56,If they or you were to
move,"around in that water,"
3390.69,what would happen is you'd
break,up the thermal layer
3392.73,and that you actually
experience,that as much colder.
3396.0,So if you really want to
push,"the resilience aspect,"
3399.14,"or for instance, if you want"
to,use a given temperature
3402.07,"that you're comfortable in,"
3403.3,but that you want to increase the stimulus
3405.54,and you want to get some more benefit
3407.39,"for mental resilience training,"
3409.19,"well then get into the cold water,"
3411.6,"move your body around continuously,"
3413.85,"but try and keep your mind still,"
3415.37,or even do some sort of cognitive task.
3417.59,"So as you're starting to realize,"
3419.2,there are a bunch of different variables
3420.36,that you can play with while maintaining
3422.24,the same temperature of
water,"and in doing so,"
3425.16,really keep you in the zone of what should
3428.65,and absolutely has to be safe for you
3430.85,without having to just
continually,drop the temperature
3433.16,from say 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33
3435.75,"because as I mentioned before,"
3436.67,eventually you're going to bottom out.
3438.31,So if you're one of those
people,that likes to look tough
3440.75,or really relaxed while
you're,in the ice bath
3442.93,"or cold water immersion,"
3444.12,just realize that you're
actually,cheating yourself out
3446.553,of part of the stimulus.
3448.37,"Keep those limbs moving and of course,"
3451.47,"limbs under the water, feet and hands"
3453.64,is going to be a more potent stimulus
3455.77,than hands and feet out for reasons
3458.45,that should be obvious based
on,what we talked about
3460.21,in terms of glabrous skin cooling.
3462.54,"Keep those submerged, move your body,"
3465.57,maybe move your knees up
and,"down, pedal your feet"
3468.08,"and trust me, it's going"
to,feel a lot colder
3470.12,than were you to remain stone still.
3472.3,Another very common question
3473.5,is how often to do
deliberate,cold exposure.
3476.76,It's tough to make a
recommendation,on that
3479.37,based on any peer reviewed study
3481.77,although there are a few in
humans,that point to a threshold
3484.74,of 11 minutes total per week.
3487.55,So that's total throughout the week
3489.44,divided into two or four sessions
3491.65,of two or three minutes or so.
3493.58,Now that 11 minute cutoff
is,not a strict threshold
3496.38,and is actually geared more
towards,"increases in metabolism,"
3500.15,we'll get into this a little
bit,"later in the episode,"
3502.98,"but I think the 11 minute threshold,"
3505.64,meaning 11 minutes total
of,deliberate cold exposure
3508.26,per week is a pretty good number to use
3511.46,if you need a number in
order,to keep you consistent.
3514.97,"But as we talked about earlier,"
3516.43,some of you are going
to,be in the ice bath
3519.53,or cold immersion or cold
shower,"for one minute,"
3522.07,others of you will be
in,"there for 10 minutes,"
3524.17,depending on how frequent
and,"how high, if you will,"
3527.59,those walls of adrenaline are coming.
3530.18,"So for some of you,"
3532.02,getting into a cold shower
for,three minutes total
3534.3,for the whole week will
represent,a tremendous
3537.53,achievement in terms of
willpower,and overcoming
3540.08,the resistance to doing
"that,",overcoming those walls.
3542.38,"For others of you, three"
minutes,is nothing.
3545.0,"So what do I recommend,"
3546.92,I recommend that you get at
least,"11 minutes total per week,"
3551.11,but at the point where
11,minutes total per week
3553.28,"is very easy for you,"
3554.18,where is no longer representing
3555.81,"a significant mental challenge,"
3557.21,meaning you're not experiencing
many,"of these walls,"
3559.13,you're excited to get into
the,"cold shower immersion,"
3561.79,"you're going through it easily,"
you're,cruising basically.
3564.61,Then I would say either
lower,"the temperature safely,"
3567.85,"of course, extend the"
duration,"safely, of course,"
3571.43,or increase the frequency
so,that you're doing this
3573.88,perhaps every day or
maybe,five days a week
3576.69,or three days a week.
3577.55,I personally get tremendous benefit
3579.37,from doing deliberate cold
exposure,three times a week
3582.48,and using the walls method
that,I described earlier
3585.6,as my gauge for how long to stay in
3587.48,and typically that means that
I'm,staying in for anywhere
3590.36,from two minutes to
six,minutes per session
3593.77,and that averages out to about
3596.8,11 to 15 minutes total per week.
3599.63,"So again, I do not think that"
you,need to be super strict
3602.9,about these guidelines.
3604.24,It's most important when
embracing,"a protocol A,"
3607.14,"that you do it safely,"
3608.26,but secondarily that
you,do it consistently.
3611.38,So find what you can do consistently
3613.17,and then vary the parameters
3614.46,that will allow you to continue to do
3616.38,"deliberate cold exposure consistently,"
3618.4,regardless of whether or not
you,have access to a shower
3620.52,"or cold immersion, et cetera."
3622.41,So we've been talking about mental effects
3624.43,and the use of deliberate cold exposure
3626.3,"for sake of building resilience,"
3628.09,which I do believe can
be,tremendously powerful.
3630.66,"Look, it's no coincidence"
that,the screening
3635.07,and the training for Navy Seals
3637.05,involves a lot of exposure to cold water.
3640.11,One could argue that it is deliberate
3641.82,"because they elect to go to buds,"
3643.77,but when they get into
the,cold water at buds
3646.44,is dictated by the
instructors,and the reason
3649.42,they use cold water
exposure,as the stressor
3652.3,is that it does offer considerable leeway
3655.23,"in terms of duration and temperature,"
3658.05,in terms of how you can
use,it as a stressor
3660.82,whereas things like heat don't
offer,much variable space
3664.01,as we say.
3665.16,There isn't a lot of room
beyond,which you start injuring
3668.69,or even killing people by using heat.
3670.76,So there are a lot of forms
of,"stressors out there,"
3672.57,"but cold is one that we can titrate,"
3674.54,that we can adjust in
ways,that can allow us
3676.47,to continually build up and
or,maintain mental toughness.
3681.89,"Now, deliberate cold exposure"
also,has many effects
3685.63,on chemicals other than
norepinephrine,"and epinephrine,"
3688.8,"most notably the neuromodulator dopamine,"
3692.05,"which is involved in elevating our mood,"
3694.45,making us feel energized and
enhancing,our ability to focus.
3698.17,And that has a lot to do
with,how dopamine engages us
3701.21,"in motivated states,"
3703.12,tends to narrow our
thinking,in our behavior
3705.24,into a particular trench
of,goal-directed behavior.
3708.01,"If you want to learn more about dopamine,"
3710.59,you can learn a lot about dopamine
3712.41,"in our episode about dopamine,"
it's,at hubermanlab.com.
3715.33,"You can find it, it's a"
two,and a half hour plus
3718.42,kind of deep dive into
all,"things dopamine,"
3720.99,"focus, motivation, et cetera."
3724.86,Deliberate cold exposure
has,a very powerful effect
3728.75,on the release of dopamine
in,our brain and body.
3731.1,And this is one of the main
reasons,why people continue
3734.36,to do deliberate cold exposure.
3737.07,Basically it makes us feel good
3739.21,and it continues to make us feel good
3741.3,even after we get out
of,the cold environment.
3743.65,"In fact, some people would say"
3745.49,they don't feel good in
the,"cold environment,"
3747.02,"it's all stress for them,"
3747.93,but afterwards they feel great.
3750.18,One of our previous
"guests,","Dr. Anna Lembke,"
3752.33,who's a medical doctor
at,Stanford University
3754.39,"School of Medicine, she's"
a,"close colleague of mine,"
3757.32,described the use dopamine
in,"her book, Dopamine Nation,"
3760.43,an incredible book about
addiction,and dopamine
3762.37,I should mention.
3763.47,And the use of dopamine
elicited,by cold water exposure
3769.52,by one of her patients.
3770.64,What I'm referring to is the
fact,that one of her patients
3773.86,helped themselves get
and,stay sober off drugs
3777.13,by using deliberate cold
exposure,to increase dopamine.
3781.04,So a healthier form of dopamine release
3783.13,than they were engaged in
prior,to getting sober.
3787.06,"Now, the basis for dopamine release"
3789.93,in response to cold exposure
3791.49,"is that the catecholamines,"
"norepinephrine,",
3793.37,epinephrine and dopamine
tend,to be co-released
3796.59,"by the same sorts of stimuli,"
3798.7,but most stressors and
in,particular things
3801.41,that evoke stress or our
feelings,of stress internally
3804.85,that we don't like do
not,increase dopamine.
3808.02,They only increase
norepinephrine,"and epinephrine,"
3810.56,but deliberate cold exposure
3812.24,seems to cause a dramatic
increase,in dopamine.
3816.05,And this has actually been substantiated
3817.86,in a really beautiful study entitled
3820.18,human physiological responses
3821.73,to immersion into water
of,different temperatures.
3824.67,The first author is Sramek.
3826.99,I'm almost certainly
pronouncing,that poorly
3830.09,"and if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K."
3834.23,This was published in the European Journal
3835.82,"of Applied Physiology in the year 2000,"
3838.46,really a beautiful
"study,",I love this study.
3840.7,They took people and they
had,them sit in chairs
3843.74,underwater but their head was
out,and so they were immersed
3846.75,up to the neck in either of
three,different temperatures.
3852.194,"32 degrees Celsius, which"
is,"89 degrees Fahrenheit,"
3856.26,"20 degrees Celsius, which"
is,"68 degrees Fahrenheit,"
3859.37,"or 14 degrees Celsius, which"
is,57.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
3863.76,"So not super cold, but then what they did"
3867.42,is they measured people's core
body,temperature throughout.
3870.01,They measured their metabolism
3871.697,and they looked at serum levels
3873.75,"of things like norepinephrine,"
"epinephrine,","dopamine,"
3876.82,"and cortisol, serum"
meaning,within the blood.
3879.41,So a really nice and quite thorough study.
3883.27,There were not a huge number
of,"subjects in the study,"
3886.27,"but nonetheless, it was"
a,very thorough study
3888.5,in terms of the number of
variables,that they explored.
3892.63,So I just want to briefly highlight
3894.05,some of what they saw or what
they,observed in this study.
3897.76,"First of all, all the"
groups,were in the water
3901.68,"of a given temperature for one hour,"
3904.52,which is much longer than most
3906.26,of the deliberate cold exposure protocols
3908.12,that anyone is using at home.
3909.5,"I mean, maybe you're taking"
one,"hour long cold showers,"
3912.24,maybe you're getting into
the,ice bath for an hour
3914.46,although I don't recommend that.
3915.54,I think you'd probably get
badly,hypothermic or maybe
3918.84,you're getting into a cold water immersion
3921.47,"for some period of time,"
3922.53,but I have a hard time imagining
that,it would be an hour
3925.01,and I don't suggest
that,if it's very cold.
3927.16,So this study focused on actually somewhat
3929.42,"moderately cool temperatures,"
3931.84,not what I think most
people,would consider
3933.99,"very, very cold temperatures,"
3935.68,but extended the duration
for,quite a while.
3938.41,"So again, 32 degree Celsius,"
3941.24,20 degree Celsius or 14 degree Celsius.
3944.1,Here's what they observed.
3945.73,The group that was immersed up to the neck
3948.78,"in 32 degrees Celsius, that"
is,"89 degrees Fahrenheit,"
3951.96,water did not experience
a,shift in metabolism
3955.42,"nor a significant increase in dopamine,"
3958.33,norepinephrine or these
other,catecholamines.
3961.07,"The group that was in 20 degree Celsius,"
3963.67,"meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit,"
3966.4,water for an hour
experienced,a 93% increase
3970.57,"in metabolic rate, which is remarkable"
3973.38,given that the water wasn't that cold
3975.96,and yet an hour is a pretty
long,time to be in there.
3978.54,"And again, it speaks"
to,the dramatic effect
3981.34,of heat transfer that water
"has,","which I mentioned earlier,"
3984.65,as opposed to being out
in,"the air at 68 degrees,"
3987.39,it would certainly not cause that increase
3989.61,in metabolic rate.
3991.57,"The group that was at 14 degrees Celsius,"
3995.02,"meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,"
3997.84,water for an hour experienced
a,350% increase in metabolism.
4002.83,So huge increases in metabolism.
4005.29,"Now the most interesting data to me,"
4008.72,at least in terms of mental effects
4010.56,"of deliberate cold exposure,"
4012.45,were that the plasma or serum
levels,of norepinephrine
4018.2,in the blood increased 530%.
4021.66,These are huge increases in norepinephrine
4024.38,so it suggests that this
is,a stressful stimulus
4027.27,at least neurochemically
"speaking,","stressful,"
4030.07,despite the fact that
it's,"not super super cold,"
4032.35,"although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,"
4034.87,14 degrees Celsius it's
not,"a warm environment,"
4040.41,"but it's not a ultra,"
ultra,"cold environment,"
4042.61,but an hour is a very
long,time to be in there.
4046.6,The subjects also
experienced,a 250% increase
4051.71,"in dopamine concentrations,"
4054.1,which while not 530% as
it,was with norepinephrine
4058.13,is still a very large increase
4060.67,in baseline levels of dopamine.
4062.55,And what was interesting is
that,those increases in dopamine
4065.46,persisted for a very long
period,"of time afterwards,"
4069.25,even out to two hours.
4071.53,And they stopped the
study,after 120 minutes
4074.44,of getting out of the
"cold,","but nonetheless,"
4078.23,these increases in norepinephrine
are,huge and long lasting
4081.83,and these increases in dopamine
4083.37,are very large and long lasting.
4085.84,And I do believe that these
documented,effects in humans
4088.91,explain much of the enhancement
of,attention and of feelings
4093.06,of wellbeing and mood that
people,typically experience
4096.43,after doing deliberate cold exposure.
4099.12,And the reason I say that is that
4101.78,if you were to go back to the episode
4103.63,"that I did on dopamine,"
4104.77,or you were to go back to the episode
4106.22,that I did with Dr. Anna Lembke
on,"addiction and dopamine,"
4109.77,what you would find is
that,increases in dopamine
4112.88,of the sort evoked by
deliberate,cold exposure
4115.88,are actually very similar
to,the kinds of increases
4118.14,in dopamine that are elicited
by,things like nicotine
4121.44,or from other behaviors
4123.21,that are known to be
addictive,and bad for us
4125.96,because they lead to
other,effects on the brain
4128.09,and body that we simply don't want.
4130.29,And yet deliberate cold
exposure,provided is done safely
4133.86,can create similar if not
greater,increases in dopamine
4138.61,"that are not just fleeting,"
that,"don't just occur during,"
4141.89,say the consumption of some
deleterious,"drug or activity,"
4145.22,but that are very long lasting
and,that can be leveraged
4147.82,toward activities other than
deliberate,cold exposure.
4151.86,So I want to emphasize this.
4153.14,I'm not suggesting
4154.15,that people do deliberate cold
exposure,for an hour a day.
4156.84,And unfortunately there
are,not many studies yet
4160.33,exploring how shorter colder temperature
4163.83,"environment exposure, say"
one,minute or three minutes
4167.11,or six minutes at 55
degrees,"or at 50 degrees,"
4172.17,"whether or not that leads to similar,"
4174.7,greater or reduced levels of
dopamine,in the brain and body.
4178.82,And yet almost everybody who
does,deliberate cold exposure
4182.62,"will say yeah, it was stressful."
4184.52,"I didn't enjoy it, or I"
eventually,"grew to like it,"
4187.4,but that I always feel better afterwards
4189.67,and then that feeling last
a,very long period of time.
4192.71,And I think it's almost certain
4194.62,that those experiences that people report
4196.86,relate to these increases in dopamine
4198.85,and in concert with the
increases,in norepinephrine
4202.05,also explain the other effect
that's,"commonly reported,"
4204.53,which is an enhancement in mental acuity
4206.98,and the ability to focus.
4209.19,"Now, here we can extrapolate to the study"
4211.77,that I discussed at the
early,"part of the episode,"
4214.9,where I was talking about the use of
4216.37,"short 15 minute exercise,"
4218.15,kind of moderate intensity exercise
4219.8,and how that was shown to
increase,levels of energy
4222.78,and mental acuity
4223.8,"in these working memory,"
visual,attention tasks.
4226.5,"And there, again, we"
have,to assume somewhat
4229.35,because they weren't doing
neurochemical,"measurements,"
4231.49,but we can reasonably assume
that,those improvements
4235.27,in cognitive performance were due
4237.52,at least in part to the
increase,in catecholamines
4239.76,"known to a company, moderate"
intensity,zone two cardio.
4243.75,So what you're starting
to,see here is a theme.
4245.83,The theme is that virtually any stimulus
4249.28,"that delivers more norepinephrine,"
4251.13,epinephrine and dopamine to our system
4253.21,will sharpen our mental
acuity,and elevate our mood
4255.68,and will do so for some period of time.
4258.31,"Deliberate cold exposure, it turns out,"
4260.52,is a very potent way to
increase,"these catecholamines,"
4263.52,this category of chemicals
and,"thereby to improve mood,"
4266.74,mental acuity and levels of alertness.
4269.19,"And as we'll next see, it"
not,"only has that effect,"
4273.07,which can be very
beneficial,for many people
4275.17,"in a bunch of different circumstances,"
4276.94,but it also has the positive
effects,that many people seek
4281.0,"in terms of metabolism, in"
lowering,inflammation in the body
4284.35,and other physiological effects as well.
4286.62,"And forgive me,"
4287.453,I was almost ready to move on to effects
4290.12,of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism
4292.78,"and inflammation and so forth,"
4294.33,but I neglected to point
out,one of the other
4296.69,very interesting aspects of the study
4299.95,showing deliberate cold exposure
4301.72,can increase in
norepinephrine,"and dopamine,"
4304.21,which is that they observed
no,significant increases
4308.18,in the stress hormone cortisol
4310.3,"and that is both surprising,"
"interesting,",and important
4313.67,because what it means is
that,the quality of stress
4317.5,that deliberate cold exposure
is,creating in the body
4320.78,is likely to be one of
what,we call use stress.
4324.56,"Hans Selye, the great physiologist,"
4327.42,won a Nobel Prize for
distinguishing,"between distress,"
4330.83,which is stress in the brain and body
4333.23,that causes the release
of,things like cortisol
4336.6,"along with the other catecholamines,"
4338.01,and that we experience as
negative,happening to us
4340.78,and can lead to negative health outcomes.
4342.91,"And he distinguished that from eustress,"
4345.44,which was stress that we now understand
4347.92,is associated with increases
in,things like norepinephrine
4350.59,"and dopamine, but no"
increases,or minimal increases
4354.01,"in cortisol, and that can lead"
to,positive health outcomes.
4357.6,So it appears that deliberate
cold,exposure can create
4361.33,what we call or what Hans
Selye,called eustress.
4364.83,"In other words, it can create"
a,condition in the brain
4366.99,and body in which we
are,"stressing ourselves,"
4369.9,"we are training up resilience,"
4371.24,and yet we are creating
a,neurochemical milieu
4374.18,that actually has many health benefits.
4376.42,Now I'd like to shift our attention
4377.63,to the effects of deliberate
cold,exposure on metabolism.
4380.83,And I'd like to start by detailing a study
4383.35,that was performed on humans
4385.18,and published just at
the,end of last year.
4387.79,The title of the study is altered
4389.29,"brown fat thermoregulation,"
4390.89,and enhanced cold induced thermogenesis
4393.67,"in young, healthy winter swimming men."
4396.02,And I should point out
that,while the study
4398.37,"was only performed on male subjects,"
4400.63,there's no reason to
think,that the effects
4402.88,that they discovered
would,only pertain to men.
4405.19,I would hope that they would
also,do a study on women
4407.16,"at some point in the future,"
4408.84,but the effects that they describe
4410.9,are very basic core
physiological,processes.
4414.74,What they did is they looked
at,at deliberate cold exposure
4417.26,"in this group of young men,"
4418.76,and they used that 11
minute,threshold per week.
4423.0,"So in other words, they had"
them,get into cold water
4426.82,for approximately 11 minutes per week.
4430.2,"And again, that's 11"
minutes,total per week.
4433.64,They divided that into two sessions
4436.03,although in speaking with the
first,"author of this study,"
4438.8,"Dr. Susanna SÃ¸berg,"
4439.99,I learned that it
probably,is not important
4442.35,"that it be two sessions,"
4443.54,"it could be three or even four sessions,"
4446.31,as long as it reaches
that,11 minute threshold.
4449.91,What they discovered was
4451.21,that by going into
these,"cold environments,"
4454.86,in this case cold water
immersion,"up to the neck,"
4458.01,"for 11 minutes total per week,"
4461.29,that these men experienced increases
4463.83,"in so-called brown fat thermogenesis,"
4466.7,I'll talk more about
what,"that is in a moment,"
4468.75,and increases in core body temperature
4470.84,that translate to increases
in,core body metabolism.
4474.95,"Now, the overall increases"
in,core body metabolism
4477.86,that they experienced
were,not extremely large.
4482.89,"They were statistically significant,"
4484.64,but they weren't extremely large.
4485.99,"However, the changes in brown fat stores"
4490.43,are perhaps what's most
interesting,about this study
4493.15,and I'll tell you why.
4494.47,The metabolic increases of
deliberate,cold exposure
4497.62,are both acute meaning
happening,in the short term.
4500.33,When you get into the cold
and,"immediately after,"
4502.95,one does experience an
increase,"in core metabolism,"
4506.47,"you burn some calories, in other words,"
4509.73,and while those might not be
very,"significant increases,"
4514.56,or I should say they can be
statistically,"significant,"
4517.77,but they are not enormously large numbers
4520.74,"of calories burned,"
4522.67,the longer lasting effects
of,deliberate cold exposure
4527.24,on metabolism seem to take
place,by changes that occur
4530.71,in the types of fat that
we,store in our body
4534.13,and the way that that fat
impacts,our metabolism
4536.7,at other times throughout
the,24 hour cycle.
4541.82,This actually has a
somewhat,"anecdotal basis,"
4544.69,in particular in Scandinavia.
4546.93,"I don't speak Swedish nor I speak Danish,"
4549.47,"nor do I speak Norwegian,"
4551.2,but I do have Danish relatives
4553.0,and they were able to help me decipher
4555.44,"a common Swedish saying,"
4558.06,which essentially
translates,to the fact that
4561.16,"in preparation for the summer, they say,"
4565.36,one should expose themselves
to,warm environments
4569.03,so that one is comfortable
in,warm environments
4572.28,in the summer.
4573.17,That's one half of this
traditional,Swedish
4576.5,and also Danish saying.
4577.97,The other half of this
traditional,Danish-Swedish saying
4582.42,"is that in preparation for winter,"
4584.83,in order to not feel too
cold,"in cold environments,"
4588.8,one should prepare for those in the fall
4591.33,by not wearing a jacket
and,exposing one's self
4594.27,to cold environments.
4596.24,"Now, of course, this is just"
anecdotal,"cultural lore,"
4600.17,"but it actually has a physiological basis,"
4602.25,which is by exposing
oneself,to cold environments
4606.43,on a repeated basis in
anticipation,of exposure
4610.08,"to more extreme cold environments,"
4612.14,one can feel more comfortable
4614.0,in those extreme cold environments.
4616.04,And that's exactly what they observed
4618.21,in this study by SÃ¸berg et al.
4620.43,The men felt more
comfortable,in extreme cold
4623.98,if they had trained through
deliberate,"cold exposure,"
4627.41,"which might not seem surprising at all,"
4629.92,"but based on what we talked about earlier,"
4632.31,whereby deliberate cold
exposure,evokes this discomfort
4636.07,and this experience of
norepinephrine,"release,"
4638.67,"at least in the short term,"
then,"you would say, well,"
4641.99,shouldn't that deliberate
cold,exposure also
4644.11,make them feel uncomfortable
4645.28,like they really want to get out?
4646.72,"Well, that is true"
4648.28,in the beginning of a deliberate
cold,"exposure protocol,"
4651.46,meaning in the first week
or,in the second week
4653.51,"or the third week, but what one finds"
4655.06,and what you will find if you do
4656.87,deliberate cold exposure
consistently,is that you will then
4661.19,become more comfortable
at,cold temperatures
4664.6,away from the deliberate cold exposure.
4666.75,So whereas you might have
previously,been the person
4669.21,who is always cold in the
room,"with air conditioning,"
4671.21,"or always seeking a sweater,"
always,"wanting to bundle up,"
4674.03,you will be more comfortable
in,those cold environments.
4676.06,And the reason for that
is,well substantiated
4680.02,from this study and from animal studies
4683.29,whereby deliberate cold exposure
4686.26,"converts one particular kind of fat cell,"
4689.56,"the white fat cell,"
4691.12,which is a very low metabolic output cell.
4695.32,It's basically a storage site for energy
4697.45,in the body fat cells to a
different,"type of fat cell,"
4701.29,which is the beige fat cell called beige
4704.44,because it's actually
beige,or slightly brown
4707.03,"under the microscope, or"
even,"to brown fat cells,"
4710.47,which are very dark under
the,microscope and dark
4712.95,because they contain mitochondria
4715.96,and are very metabolically
and,thermogenetically active.
4720.53,"In other words, white fat"
doesn't,burn many calories.
4723.89,It's basically a storage site.
4725.56,It's a bank account for energy.
4727.65,"It's filled with lipids,"
4730.02,and those lipids can be used
if,the body needs energy
4733.53,and if it goes into a caloric deficit.
4735.72,Beige fat and brown fat
acts,as sort of a furnace
4739.7,or the sort of fat that
you,"would find in a kindle,"
4743.43,a fuel that can increase
core,body temperature.
4746.13,So beige fat and brown fat is very good
4749.55,at raising our metabolism
and,helps burn white fat.
4753.36,"Now of course,"
4754.193,it does that only in the
context,"of a caloric deficit,"
4758.38,but it can actually help
create,that caloric deficit.
4762.01,Having more beige fat and brown fat
4764.61,can increase your overall core
"metabolism,","in other words,"
4767.88,the number of calories
that,"you burn per day,"
4770.33,and therefore the number of calories
4771.73,that you need to either
maintain,or to lose weight.
4775.86,The simple translation of
this,is that getting into
4779.18,cold water for a total of
11,"minutes, perhaps more,"
4783.08,but at least 11 minutes per week
4785.02,divided into two or four sessions
4787.75,can increase your core metabolism in part
4790.55,by increasing your beige
and,brown fat stores.
4794.24,And we know how that works
at,least in animal models
4797.44,and there's now reason to suspect
4799.31,that the exact same mechanisms
are,occurring in humans.
4802.35,The primary way in which
deliberate,cold exposure converts
4805.92,white fat cells into
these,more metabolically
4808.54,thermogenetically active
metabolism,increasing
4811.73,beige and brown fat cells
is,because norepinephrine
4818.28,released when we get into
the,cold binds to receptors
4822.29,on the surface of white
fat,cells and activates
4825.87,"downstream pathways such as UCP1,"
4830.04,"so this is an uncoupling protein one,"
4832.67,that acts on the mitochondrial
metabolism,of cells
4835.55,and increases the mitochondrial
output,of those cells
4839.11,and the mitochondrial
density,of those cells.
4841.38,"In other words,"
4842.26,it takes a cell that has
a,kind of a weak engine
4846.18,or no engine for generating energy.
4848.91,"Although every cell has some mitochondria,"
4851.04,it takes cells that have
very,few mitochondria
4853.65,and increases the engine size.
4856.36,It kind of stokes the furnace
of,those particular cells
4860.01,and actually can change gene
expression,in those cells.
4863.51,So that's what's really interesting.
4864.68,Deliberate cold exposure causes
increases,in norepinephrine.
4868.46,which bind to receptors on the
surfaces,"of white fat cells,"
4872.72,which triggers the release
of,things like UCP1.
4876.34,It also causes the release
of,"things like P-part gamma,"
4879.6,and co-factor PGC1.
4882.1,I'm going to refer you to a review
4883.57,if you want to learn more about these.
4885.48,For those of you that
don't,"want to learn more,"
4886.87,all you need to know is that
the,downstream of all that
4889.64,are increases in
mitochondria,and metabolism
4892.44,and actual genetic changes
in,the white fat cells
4896.29,that convert them into
beige,and brown fat cells.
4899.52,This is especially important for adults
4901.43,because babies and young
children,actually don't have
4906.69,the ability to shiver
4907.78,or they have a less
robust,capacity to shiver.
4911.57,Very small babies really can't shiver
4913.46,so they have a lot of brown
fat,in order to keep them warm.
4917.48,Young children eventually
develop,the ability to shiver
4921.23,"and maintain these brown fat stores,"
4922.95,"mainly around the clavicles,"
the,"heart, the upper spine,"
4926.02,and in the upper back.
4927.69,And it's no coincidence that
kids,can often run around
4930.88,with a minimal of clothing
and,be comfortable
4932.58,in environments that
adults,would be cold in.
4936.97,"As life goes on, we tend to"
lose,"beige and brown fat,"
4941.05,but this mechanism that I'm referring to
4943.72,"points to the plasticity of white fat,"
4945.7,meaning the ability for
white,fat to actually convert
4947.93,its identity into this
metabolically,thermogenetically
4951.0,enhancing form of beige and brown fat.
4953.95,So deliberate cold
exposure,is a terrific way
4956.56,to increase your core metabolism
4958.47,"and oftentimes critics will say, well,"
4960.3,the increase in metabolism
isn't,that significant
4962.58,"although I do want to point out again,"
4964.47,the 93% and 350% increases in metabolism
4969.56,from that previous study.
4971.08,"But critics then will say, well,"
4973.77,that doesn't really translate
to,that big of a caloric burn
4979.04,during the deliberate cold exposure.
4980.98,"But to that, you should say, ah,"
4982.7,but that's only limiting your optics
4984.87,to just a portion of the effects
4986.33,of deliberate cold exposure
because,deliberate cold exposure
4989.13,can also convert white fat
to,beige fat and brown fat
4992.86,and lead to these more lasting
increases,in metabolism.
4997.04,So for any of you interested
in,increasing your metabolism
4999.737,and or being comfortable
in,cold environments
5002.52,and or being comfortable in terms of
5005.25,"being able to combat stress mentally,"
5007.55,"deliberate cold exposure, I"
do,believe is a powerful tool.
5011.0,And there is simply no reason
why,you couldn't and shouldn't
5014.39,use the same protocols
that,I described earlier
5016.99,for building resilience
to,increase metabolism.
5019.97,Provided you're hitting that
11,"minute per week threshold,"
5023.45,you ought to be stimulating
both,mechanism increases
5027.17,in resilience and increases
in,core metabolism.
5031.85,"As I mentioned earlier,"
5032.683,most of the detailed studies
on,the conversion of white fat
5035.58,to beige fat and brown fat
through,the use of cold
5037.86,"have been done in animal models,"
5039.56,but the human data are starting to emerge.
5041.5,And if you'd like to do the
deep,"dive into these mechanisms,"
5044.26,"things like UCP1, P-part gamma, et cetera,"
5047.24,there's a beautiful review
that,was published recently
5049.68,"in the journal cell,"
5050.62,"which is one of the three apex journals,"
5052.16,"nature, science, cell."
5053.71,And the title of that paper
is,adipose tissue plasticity
5057.22,in health and disease.
5058.17,I love this review.
5059.46,It has beautiful diagrams
detailing,all of the pathways
5062.82,from cold to norepinephrine through UCP1
5066.5,downstream of things like cyclic AMP.
5068.14,If none of those names
mean,"anything to you,"
5070.28,don't worry about it.
5071.13,You certainly don't need
to,know these mechanisms
5072.87,to benefit from deliberate
cold,exposure protocols.
5075.81,"If those names do mean something to you,"
5078.19,or you are interested in
exploring,the downstream effects
5081.2,of deliberate cold
exposure,and something else
5083.63,that's really nice that's
covered,in this paper
5085.62,is how deliberate cold exposure interacts
5088.1,with fasted states and fed states.
5091.77,I think you'll also find
this,review very interesting.
5094.33,I don't want to go too
deeply,into fasted states
5096.37,"and fed states right now,"
5098.14,"suffice to say that when we are fasted,"
5100.49,meaning when we have an eaten
for,"some period of time,"
5103.07,our baseline levels of norepinephrine
5106.08,and epinephrine are already elevated.
5109.0,And so cold exposure at those times
5111.39,ought to have an even
greater,effect on metabolism
5114.9,and resilience and so on.
5116.51,So for you fasters or your
intermittent,"fasters out there,"
5120.44,"if you really want to get fancy,"
5121.89,you can do your deliberate cold exposure
5124.13,when you are fasted.
5125.63,I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it
5127.15,with a very full stomach in any case.
5129.5,"And as I mentioned before on this podcast,"
5133.01,"intermittent fasting is, but one way,"
5136.24,and certainly there are other ways
5137.58,to limit total caloric intake
for,sake of maintaining
5140.72,or losing weight if that's your goal.
5143.15,I know many people are using and benefit
5145.51,"from intermittent fasting, however,"
5147.44,and so it certainly can be combined
5149.7,with deliberate cold exposures in order
5151.54,to get even greater increases
5153.04,in norepinephrine and epinephrine.
5154.89,So for those of you that
are,primarily interested
5157.14,in using deliberate cold exposure
5158.61,to increase dopamine levels
in,"your brain and body,"
5162.26,you can also do a combined protocol
5165.52,whereby you ingest
caffeine,60 to 120 minutes
5169.17,before the deliberate cold exposure.
5171.77,This is based on a study
that,I've talked about before
5174.7,entitled caffeine increases
striatal,"dopamine D-2,"
5178.04,D-3 receptor availability
in,the human brain.
5180.44,"And as the title suggests,"
this,"study was done on humans,"
5183.79,looking at the density and or efficacy
5187.58,of these dopamine receptors
5189.05,in an area of the brain
called,"the striatum,"
5190.83,which is involved in planning in action
5192.54,and also suppressing planning in action.
5194.35,It's involved very closely
with,whether or not
5197.63,we can engage in behavior
and,"withhold behavior,"
5201.12,the so-called go and no
go,ways in the brain.
5204.27,Dopamine plays a critical role in that
5205.627,and many other things
as,well as you now know.
5209.27,So why would you want to ingest
caffeine,60 to 120 minutes
5212.67,before deliberate cold exposure?
5215.05,"Well, as I talked about earlier,"
5217.72,dopamine can increase quite substantially
5220.3,"in response to deliberate cold exposure,"
5222.21,but dopamine on its own
doesn't,"do anything,"
5224.05,it has to bind to receptors
5226.02,and this paper shows quite definitively
5228.72,"that ingesting caffeine in this case,"
5230.37,"it was 300 milligram dose of caffeine,"
5232.4,which is about the dose of caffeine
5234.2,"in two or three cups of coffee,"
5235.48,it depends on the strength
of,"the coffee, of course,"
5237.6,but it's not an outrageous
amount,"of caffeine,"
5241.15,that increases the density and or efficacy
5243.85,"of these receptors,"
5244.683,which you would allow that dopamine
5245.86,to have its greatest effect.
5248.86,And for those of you that want
to,"get really, really fancy,"
5251.16,I suppose you could do this fasted
5252.62,so you get the further
increase,"in norepinephrine,"
5255.047,then you get the dopamine
increase,"from the cold exposure,"
5257.24,the binding of the dopamine.
5258.92,Although I do want to point
out,"that at some point,"
5262.14,you start layering
together,enough protocols
5264.11,that you would to be
spending,your entire day
5265.71,trying to get this dopamine pulse
5267.12,and I would hope that you
would,have other activities
5269.6,"that you would engage in,"
5270.81,but if you're getting up in
the,morning and you're fasted
5273.81,because you haven't eaten all night
5275.07,"and you have a cup of coffee,"
and,"then 60 minutes later,"
5277.38,you take your cold shower
or,"two hours later,"
5280.54,you do your cold immersion
or,"your cold shower,"
5282.93,you would be layering together
5284.76,these different mechanisms
of,"dopamine receptors,"
5286.95,epinephrine and so forth in
a,"way that at least to me,"
5289.21,doesn't seem incompatible
with,having some other life
5292.5,like going to school and having
"relationships,",et cetera.
5295.09,"And this increase in dopamine,"
5296.77,particularly in the striatum
is,not a trivial one.
5300.78,I do want to point out as the authors do
5303.21,that preclinical studies have shown
5304.9,that increases in striatal dopamine
5307.38,"induced by things like modafinil,"
5309.43,which is used to treat
ADHD,"and treat narcolepsy,"
5313.32,is necessary for their
wake,promoting actions.
5316.18,What this really says is that
just,having elevated levels
5318.67,of dopamine from a drug
or,"from an ice bath,"
5321.23,or what have you is not sufficient
5323.31,"to get the effects of dopamine,"
5324.61,you really need the
receptors,to be available
5327.41,and you need those
receptors,to be available
5329.09,in the appropriate density
5330.48,and you need those
receptors,to be available
5332.64,in the appropriate density in
the,striatum in particular.
5335.35,So I think there are a
number,of reasons why
5337.54,if it's compatible with the
other,"aspects of your health,"
5340.6,cause of course always
you,have to consider this
5342.32,on a background of cardiovascular health
5343.99,"and blood pressure, et cetera,"
5345.2,that ingesting a cup or two of coffee
5347.29,an hour before your ice
bath,may be fasted as well
5351.29,could be quite beneficial
for,increasing dopamine
5353.55,over quite extended periods of time.
5355.69,A couple of key points that
you'll,want to pay attention to
5358.29,in thinking about deliberate
cold,exposure and metabolism.
5361.3,"In the SÃ¸berg study,"
5362.3,they also explored the use of
sauna,"and how to use sauna,"
5367.1,meaning deliberate heat
in,conjunction with cold.
5370.45,We are going to do an entire
episode,about the use of heat
5373.49,for health and performance.
5374.7,"So that is not the focus now, however,"
5378.8,it does raise an important point
5380.2,"that we do need to address at this moment,"
5382.15,which is if you are using sauna
5385.0,or if you are taking warm showers
5387.34,or if you are simply using
deliberate,cold exposure
5390.09,"of any kind,"
5391.19,should you get into the heat afterward
5394.06,or before or not at all?
5395.84,And this is where we can
point,to the so-called
5399.26,"SÃ¸berg principle, at least I"
call,"it the SÃ¸berg principle,"
5402.38,the SÃ¸berg principle named after
first,"author of this study,"
5405.33,"I referred to earlier, Dr. Susanna SÃ¸berg."
5409.17,"In science, it is appropriate"
to,take a key piece of data
5412.98,and call it a principle
5414.51,if in fact it translates
to,"something larger,"
5416.54,which I believe it does.
5418.2,It is generally not appropriate for people
5420.41,to name a principle after themselves
5422.02,although there are a few
scientists,that have done that.
5425.43,"So I have named it the SÃ¸berg principle,"
5427.05,but I did that to give
it,appropriate credit
5430.31,"to Dr. Susanna SÃ¸berg,"
5432.07,who discovered that and pointed
out,"quite appropriately,"
5436.29,that to achieve the greatest
increases,in metabolism
5440.43,"through deliberate cold exposure,"
5442.76,you want to force yourself
to,reheat on your own
5447.49,"after the deliberate cold exposure,"
5449.28,meaning you wouldn't want
to,go from the cold shower
5452.16,to a hot shower or from
the,cold shower to a sauna.
5454.87,Rather if you were going
to,start with a hot shower
5457.17,or you're going to start with a sauna
5458.77,"that you would end with the cold,"
5461.03,and then you would reheat naturally.
5463.83,Now I personally take a cold
shower,a few times a week
5466.93,or do cold immersion
5468.33,and because I'm not specifically focused
5470.73,"on increasing metabolism,"
although,"I probably should be,"
5473.92,"that's not what I'm using it for now,"
5476.49,I will take a hot shower
afterwards,"and in doing so,"
5478.84,I'm short circuiting
5479.92,some of the further metabolic
increases,that I would achieve
5482.81,were I to just end with the cold.
5485.21,So the SÃ¸berg principle is
5487.75,if you want to increase your
"metabolism,","end with cold,"
5491.55,and we can take this
a,step further and say
5494.6,that if you want to use
deliberate,cold exposure
5497.01,"to increase metabolism,"
that,you should make sure
5500.98,that you get to the
point,where you shiver.
5503.64,And the reason in for
this,is that there are
5505.5,"a series of studies, but in particular,"
5507.11,"one study published in the journal Nature,"
5509.0,"excellent journal in the year 2018,"
5511.77,showing that deliberate cold
exposure,that evokes shivering
5517.81,from the muscles causes
the,release of a molecule
5520.84,called succinate from the muscles
5523.48,and that succinate plays
5525.41,a key role in activating
brown,"fat thermogenesis,"
5528.86,which you now have heard
about,and understand
5530.99,as critical to the increases in metabolism
5533.14,caused by deliberate cold exposure.
5535.89,So what this means is if you want to
5537.25,"increase your metabolism, end on cold,"
5539.16,that's a SÃ¸berg principle
and,"as best you can,"
5542.3,try and get to the point
where,you are shivering
5544.9,either when you are in the cold exposure
5547.4,or immediately afterwards.
5549.29,Now one efficient way to do
this,"is to, for instance,"
5552.62,you could get into the
cold,shower for a minute
5556.12,or two minutes or three
"minutes,","uncomfortably cold,"
5558.97,but safe to stay in.
5560.12,Remember that's our general rule of thumb.
5562.5,"Then turn off the water and stand there,"
5565.47,make sure that you're not holding yourself
5567.86,"close to your body,"
5568.693,you're not hugging yourself
to,"try and keep yourself warm,"
5570.81,but rather your limbs are
extended,at your sides.
5573.96,And then if that fails to induce shiver
5576.9,"than to turn on the cold water again,"
5579.71,"and then turn it off again,"
5580.95,so alternating perhaps a
minute,to three minutes
5583.03,of cold exposure followed
by,a minute to three minutes
5585.56,of drying out in air
5587.69,and going back into the
cold,"exposure, et cetera."
5590.65,"I can tell you this from experience,"
5592.17,this is a pretty brutal protocol.
5595.19,If you have never tried
getting,into an ice bath
5598.73,or cold water immersion
or,shower for one minute
5601.63,and then getting out and
trying,to stand there
5603.37,with your arms extended in cool
or,"cold air for one minute,"
5607.25,and then getting back into the cold shower
5608.81,"or water immersion, you are"
in,for an experience because
5613.47,even for those of you that
are,"pretty shiver resistant,"
5616.11,"you'll find that it is much, much harder"
5618.27,to get out of that cold water
and,stand there arms extended
5621.92,"and drying off by evaporation,"
5623.82,which further draws heat from the body
5626.64,"than it is to wrap yourself in a towel,"
5628.3,get in a warm shower or a sauna.
5630.21,So there's certainly no
requirement,to end on cold.
5634.09,There's certainly no
requirement,"to induce shiver,"
5637.65,but if your primary goal
5639.34,"is to induce increases in metabolism,"
5642.76,both in the short term
and,"in the long term,"
5645.18,"following the cold exposure,"
5646.69,well then you'll want to end on cold
5648.01,and you'll want to find a way to shiver
5650.57,provided that the level of cold
5652.83,that you're exposing yourself to
5654.13,is still safe for you overall.
5655.88,"So up until now,"
5656.713,I've been talking about
deliberate,cold exposure
5658.84,as a potent stimulus for the
release,of norepinephrine
5661.98,"in the brain and body and indeed it is,"
5664.43,but the way I've been describing
it,has been in the context
5667.94,of circulating plasma
levels,"of norepinephrine,"
5671.87,meaning circulating within the blood.
5674.66,"What I haven't mentioned,"
5675.78,but is absolutely true is
that,the fat cells themselves
5681.74,actually receive input from neurons.
5684.74,So there are neurons that
release,norepinephrine
5687.54,"in response to cold,"
directly,into the fat.
5691.1,So I want to give you this
picture,of how the architecture
5695.1,"of all this works,"
5695.933,because I think it can help you navigate
5698.02,and indeed build better deliberate
cold,exposure protocols.
5701.81,Your adrenal glands release
norepinephrine,and epinephrine.
5705.36,Your brain has sites within
it,like the locus coeruleus
5708.94,that release norepinephrine
and,"epinephrine,"
5712.05,but there are also neurons
within,your skin that sense cold
5716.23,and other neurons that can
directly,release norepinephrine
5719.41,into the fat stores and
cause,those white fat cells
5722.68,to convert to beige and brown fat.
5724.42,And I think this particular
aspect,of our physiology
5726.96,is often overlooked in studies.
5729.77,"And when people say, oh,"
5731.06,well the increases in
metabolism,"aren't that great,"
5733.63,"the circulating levels of norepinephrine,"
5735.37,"those are very large, but"
they're,"very transient and so on,"
5739.22,that fails to understand that neurons
5743.0,that actually sense cold are
in,a position to communicate
5746.87,via other neurons
directly,to the fat cells
5749.97,and release norepinephrine
into,"those fat cells,"
5751.9,"which as I pointed out earlier,"
5753.57,set off a huge set of immediate
5755.57,and long term cascades of
even,gene expression changes.
5759.89,So the picture that I'd like
you,to have in your mind
5762.07,"is that when you get into the cold, yes,"
5764.45,of course you experience
that,as a experience of
5767.79,"I don't want to do this,"
I'm,"going to overcome this,"
5769.59,I'm going to climb over these mental walls
5771.33,that represent adrenaline
release,"in my brain and body,"
5774.05,but also that your fat
cells,"are receiving signals,"
5778.12,norepinephrine signals that
are,changing those fat cells
5780.837,and the way that they metabolize energy.
5782.9,Now I'd like to shift
our,attention to the use
5784.67,of deliberate cold exposure
5786.29,for sake of physical performance.
5788.78,And there are a lot of opinions out there
5790.45,"about the use of deliberate cold,"
5792.48,whether or not it should
be,"done for instance,"
5794.03,"before or after exercise,"
5796.2,whether or not if done immediately
after,strength training
5799.76,"or hypertrophy training,"
5800.84,meaning training designed to grow muscles
5803.49,"or make them stronger,"
5804.38,whether or not it can inhibit that process
5806.18,and so on and so forth.
5807.64,I think today in looking
over,the literature
5810.69,and trying to bring forward the simplest
5812.75,"and most straightforward,"
5813.63,"and yet scientifically grounded protocols,"
5816.03,we can set up some general
guidelines,"that will allow most,"
5819.28,"if not, all of you to"
still,extract the benefits
5821.52,of deliberate cold exposure
on,physical performance
5825.08,without getting too neurotic
about,"the exact timing,"
5828.41,but for sake of discussion
5830.71,and because it's a prominent theme
5833.27,"in many online communities,"
5834.92,let's just start with
the,"big one out there,"
5838.18,meaning the question of whether
or,not doing an ice bath
5842.0,or doing deliberate cold
exposure,or taking a cold shower
5845.07,"after strength slash hypertrophy training,"
5848.31,meaning training designed
to,increase strength
5850.72,and or I should say the size of muscles
5854.15,will somehow short circuit
or,"diminish that process,"
5857.84,whether or not it will reduce or eliminate
5859.89,those strength gains
and,hypertrophy gains.
5861.7,And the short answer that
I,was able to arrive at
5865.08,on the basis of a review
article,that I'll talk about
5868.2,in a moment and some
other,"studies as well,"
5871.17,is that if your main goal
is,"hypertrophy and strength,"
5876.33,it is probably best to
avoid,cold water immersion
5880.5,and ice bath immersion in the four hours
5884.37,immediately following that strength
5886.89,and or hypertrophy training.
5888.69,"Again, if your main goal"
is,to achieve hypertrophy
5892.91,"or strength or some combination of those,"
5895.94,probably best to avoid cold
water,immersion up to the neck
5900.2,or ice bath immersion up to the neck
5903.07,immediately after strength
and,hypertrophy training
5906.12,and extending out to about
four,hours after that training.
5911.15,"If you're really neurotic about this,"
5912.95,then perhaps you'd want to
move,the cold water exposure
5915.52,"to a different day entirely,"
5917.17,but it all depends on how
neurotically,attached you are
5919.84,to getting every last bit
of,strength and hypertrophy.
5922.38,"And if that's your goal, terrific,"
5924.09,well then probably moving
the,cold exposure four hours
5927.77,or more away from that training
5929.08,is going to be necessary for you.
5930.74,Now you'll notice I did
not,talk about cold showers
5933.73,and the reason I did not
talk,about cold showers
5935.88,is that there simply are
not,very many studies
5939.38,of deliberate cold exposure
through,cold showers
5942.01,for the reasons I talked about
5943.08,at the beginning of the episode.
5945.13,It's hard for me to imagine
that,taking a brief cold shower
5948.4,after a strength or
hypertrophy,training session
5951.07,would completely reverse or
short,circuit the effects
5953.7,of that strength and hypertrophy training.
5955.51,"But again, if you're neurotically attached"
5957.9,to getting every last bit
of,strength and hypertrophy
5961.14,out of your training
"sessions,","then by all means,"
5963.73,err on the side of caution
and,wait four hours or more
5966.28,to do your cold shower just
as,you would wait four hours
5969.65,or more to do your cold water immersion.
5971.62,Now there are nice data
pointing,to the fact
5973.95,that doing cold water
immersion,"after a hard run,"
5977.6,"so endurance training,"
5979.1,or even sprint and interval training
5981.69,or after a weight workout
where,your main focus
5985.69,is on performance of those movements
5987.56,or after a skill training workout
5989.23,where your main focus on
performance,"of those movements,"
5992.3,that there's no reason to think that that
5994.58,cold water immersion or
ice,bath or cold shower
5997.41,would inhibit the progress or the stimulus
6001.58,that would lead to progress
6003.4,that occurred during
that,training session.
6005.29,"In other words, I don't see any reason"
6007.49,based on the literature to
avoid,deliberate cold exposure
6010.6,"immediately after training,"
6012.08,again unless your goal is
hypertrophy,and strength.
6015.92,"And in fact,"
6016.753,there's a very nice
review,recently published
6019.22,on deliberate cold exposure
6021.61,and how it can impact
physical,"performance,"
6024.75,"whether or not it's done before or after,"
6027.78,different types of training and so forth.
6030.3,The paper is entitled impact
of,cold water immersion
6033.55,"compared with passive recovery,"
6035.31,following a single about
of,strenuous exercise
6037.82,on athletic performance in
physically,"active participants,"
6041.32,a systematic review with
meta-analysis,and meta regression.
6045.12,So this is a meta-analysis of 52 studies
6049.57,that looked at a tremendous
number,of variables
6051.93,"and contexts, as you would"
expect,in a meta-analysis
6055.25,of 52 studies.
6056.85,I'm going to read you the
conclusions,of the study
6058.41,and I will provide a link.
6059.93,We certainly don't have
the,time to go through
6061.61,all the details of the study.
6062.74,I will highlight a few specific outcomes
6065.15,"that I found particularly interesting,"
6067.1,but here I am paraphrasing
their,"conclusions,"
6070.44,"that cold water immersion, I"
want,"to emphasize immersion,"
6075.13,"not cold showers, but cold water immersion"
6078.12,they say was an effective recovery tool
6080.08,after high intensity exercise.
6082.34,"They observed positive outcomes,"
6083.88,"meaning improvements in certain variables,"
6087.41,"for muscular power, muscular soreness,"
6090.31,"meaning reduced muscular soreness,"
6091.61,"increased muscular power,"
6093.32,perceived recovery after
24,hours of exercise.
6096.76,"However, there were"
certain,forms of exercise
6099.36,that were not benefited
by,"cold water immersion,"
6103.37,"such as eccentric exercise,"
6105.83,exercise focusing only
on,the lowering component
6109.26,or the so-called eccentric
component,of resistance exercise.
6112.75,They saw some very entry
dose,response relationships
6116.67,for things like endurance
"training,",meaning the longer
6120.47,"the cold exposure post-endurance training,"
6122.84,the more improvement in
endurance,"performance,"
6125.33,reductions in circulating creatine kinases
6128.79,and things that relate to muscle damage
6131.3,under certain conditions.
6132.4,"At some point in the future, by the way,"
6134.28,we'll do an entire episode on
creatine,"and creatine kinase,"
6137.23,which are important not
just,"for muscular function,"
6139.74,but also for brain function.
6141.62,But the basic takeaway was
that,cold water immersion
6145.32,performed after high intensity exercise
6147.75,was beneficial from a number
of,different standpoints
6150.76,"and indicated that shorter duration,"
6154.43,cold exposure and lower temperatures
6157.21,can improve the efficacy
of,cold water exposure
6160.58,if used after high intensity exercise.
6162.97,There I'm directly pulling
from,their conclusions.
6165.45,So what this says is
that,it's not just those
6167.92,"longer duration, 30, 45"
minute,and 60 minute protocols
6172.46,of cold water immersion
that,"we discussed earlier,"
6174.91,but also shorter duration
of,"one minute, three minute,"
6178.13,five minute exposures
to,lower temperatures.
6182.51,Temperatures that would
make,you psychologically
6184.79,want to get out as soon
as,"you possibly can,"
6187.73,but again that you can safely stay in
6190.03,done after training
really,have been shown to
6192.81,improve outcomes in terms
of,reducing soreness
6195.97,"and improving training efficacy,"
6198.75,meaning your ability to get
back,into training more quickly
6202.48,and thereby deliver more training stimuli
6205.77,to a given muscle or in your
endurance,training protocol.
6209.11,"Translate to English,"
6209.943,what this means is that taking
a,cold shower or getting into
6213.02,an ice bath or some other
form,of cold water immersion
6215.81,within the immediate minutes
or,even the immediate hours
6219.16,following your training has
been,shown to be beneficial.
6223.12,I'm sure a number of you
have,"questions for instance,"
6225.86,how long should you be
in,that cold exposure?
6229.07,Is it the same as the 11 minute
threshold,described earlier?
6232.75,"To be honest with you,"
6233.68,there are not enough
studies,to really point
6236.34,to the critical threshold for eliminating
6239.9,or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness
6241.84,or for getting maximal results from power
6245.4,"and endurance training,"
6246.6,but this study does make
a,couple of key points
6249.34,and here I will just paraphrase.
6251.22,"For instance, that cold water immersion"
6253.67,is more likely to positively influence
6256.9,"muscular power performance,"
6258.7,"to reduce muscle soreness, to"
reduce,"serum creatine kinase,"
6262.73,and to improve perceived recovery
6264.96,"after high intensity exercise,"
6266.81,as compared with passive recovery.
6269.29,This can be translated to cold
water,exposure after training
6273.04,is beneficial and probably better
6275.48,than passive recovery from
a,number of standpoints.
6278.67,"In addition, they say that"
dose,response relationships
6282.91,meaning the amount and the degree of cold
6287.16,that people were exposed to
and,how often they did that
6291.27,in particular in lower
temperature,cold immersion.
6293.77,So these would be the sorts
of,cold immersion protocols
6297.05,that are one minute or two
"minutes,","three minutes,"
6299.57,"maybe five minutes,"
6300.86,but that one couldn't stay in there longer
6302.83,because it feels stressful
6303.82,and one wants to get out.
6305.61,Maybe more effective after
high,intensity exercise
6308.28,for removal of serum creatine kinase
6311.41,as well that these shorter duration
6313.46,cold water immersion approaches
may,be more effective
6316.13,after high intensity
endurance,performance as well.
6319.86,So all of this can be
translated,to say that
6322.92,unless your main goal is
hypertrophy,"and strength,"
6327.2,"that cold exposure, ideally cold immersion"
6330.877,"and cold water ice bath,"
6332.59,"but if you don't have access to that,"
6334.28,then cold showers is likely
going,to be beneficial
6337.22,if done immediately
after,or in the minutes
6339.9,"or hours after your training,"
6342.5,especially high intensity training.
6344.31,One particularly nice thing
about,this meta-analysis
6346.57,is that it included some studies that
6348.92,involve the use of cooling packs.
6350.77,"So again, vests that can"
essentially,ice packs
6355.43,and indeed even cryotherapy
chambers,and so on.
6359.04,There's a nice table in the study
6360.37,if you want to get really detailed and go
6362.22,"and look specifically at those studies,"
6363.81,I invite you to do that.
6364.85,We'll put a link to this
study,in the caption
6367.26,"for this episode, but all in all,"
6369.32,what this study shows is
that,deliberate cold exposure
6372.99,can be very useful for recovery
likely,through reductions
6377.0,"in inflammation, in muscle"
and,connective tissue.
6380.69,And while this study did
not,look specifically
6382.94,at the mechanisms of reduced inflammation
6385.9,"caused by deliberate cold exposure,"
6387.89,those mechanisms are somewhat known.
6390.52,There are a number of studies
that,have pointed to the fact
6392.73,that deliberate cold and cold generally
6394.87,"can reduce inflammatory cytokines,"
6397.4,"such as IL-6, interleukin six."
6399.56,It can increase
anti-inflammatory,cytokines
6403.16,such as interleukin 10 and so on.
6406.31,"Without getting into all those details,"
6408.04,I think it's sufficient to say that
6410.59,if you are somebody who experiences
6412.18,"a lot of delayed onset muscle soreness,"
6414.3,taking a cold shower after your training
6416.06,or getting into a cold
immersion,"after your training,"
6418.37,even if it's a few hours
later,ought to help.
6421.06,And if you are doing
particularly,"intense training,"
6424.61,then you probably want
to,ratchet up the number
6427.46,of cold exposure sessions
that,you're doing
6430.22,even if those have to
be,done on separate days
6432.42,"from your training,"
6433.253,because a lot of the
inflammatory,"effects of training,"
6435.91,endurance and strength
training,are actually occurring
6437.92,some hours away from
the,training stimulus.
6440.72,So it's not just that inflammation goes up
6442.38,"radically during training,"
which,"it often can,"
6445.1,but that it can occur even in the days
6447.26,"and even weeks afterwards,"
6448.48,depending how intense
and,how long duration
6450.44,that training is.
6451.34,So deliberate cold
exposure,is very powerful
6453.87,as an anti-inflammatory tool.
6456.44,Now I'd like to emphasize
the,topic that we touched on
6458.6,"at the beginning of the episode,"
6460.43,"which are those glabrous skin surfaces,"
6463.14,"the hands, the upper face,"
6464.42,and the bottoms of the
feet,through which heat
6467.87,is especially good at leaving the body.
6470.46,And another way of putting
that,is that one can cool
6474.86,the body much more efficiently
6476.64,through the glabrous skin surfaces.
6478.92,"Now, if you want to"
understand,all of the science
6481.53,behind this and all of
the,"various applications,"
6485.9,I invite you to please
listen,to the episode
6487.84,"that I did with Dr. Craig Heller, again,"
6490.32,in the biology department at Stanford.
6493.71,"For sake of this episode,"
6494.76,I'm just going to detail
a,couple of findings
6497.1,from his laboratory.
6498.41,"The first one, dealing with"
exercise,"induced hyperthermia,"
6501.43,because I think this is very interesting
6502.84,and it can even save lives
6504.62,if you understand the way this works.
6508.04,There's a particular paper
that,"focuses on this,"
6510.73,and we will put a link to this as well.
6512.35,The title of this paper
is,novel application
6514.2,of chemical cold packs for treatment
6515.59,"of exercise induced hyperthermia,"
6517.64,a randomized control trial.
6519.6,"This is a pretty brutal study,"
6522.2,brutal for the subjects that is.
6525.23,This study involved was having
subjects,walk on a treadmill
6529.49,at a pretty significant
incline,and anywhere
6531.32,from nine to 17% wearing a
substantial,amount of clothing
6536.3,that was not well ventilated
6538.24,and the room was kept
to,"40 degrees Celsius,"
6540.73,which is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
6543.24,This is definitely not
something,to do at home.
6546.73,This study was designed
to,"induce hyperthermia,"
6549.21,"which as I mentioned earlier,"
can,be quite dangerous.
6551.65,And they compared two types of cooling.
6554.43,In the first form of cooling
6556.24,"that they call traditional cooling,"
6558.24,"they had ice packs on their neck,"
6561.54,in their armpits and in their groin.
6563.92,"And in the other group,"
6565.55,there was the so-called
glabrous,skin cooling.
6567.87,"So the palms, the soles of the feet,"
6569.62,which were actually so they
were,cooling inside the boots
6573.58,or inside of gloves and on
the,upper portion of the face.
6579.09,And the basic takeaway of this study
6581.27,"is that by cooling the glabrous skin,"
6584.28,the subjects were able
to,sustain this walking
6587.31,on these inclined
treadmills,for much longer
6590.93,than were the people who
received,traditional cooling.
6594.24,And also the return to
baseline,temperature
6596.42,was much faster in the
glabrous,skin cooling group.
6599.86,So how this translates to the real world
6601.89,is that if ever you are hyperthermic
6604.07,"or someone else's hyperthermic,"
6606.81,one way to cool them
down,quickly is to cool
6610.43,"these palmer glabrous,"
soles,of the feet glabrous
6614.55,and upper portion of the face
glabrous,portions of the body
6618.06,"using cool rags, using ice"
packs,or using any number
6622.36,of different cold objects or temperatures.
6626.47,"One key thing, if you're going"
to,"use glabrous skin cooling,"
6630.15,is that whatever you use
to,cool those surfaces
6633.19,cannot be so cold that it
causes,vasoconstriction.
6637.12,"Because as I mentioned earlier,"
6638.97,the arterio-venous anastomoses
6641.7,these portals of arteries
directly,to veins
6643.97,that exist only in these
glabrous,"skin surfaces,"
6649.64,the way that they're able to cool the body
6651.61,and essentially pass cool into the body
6653.95,although that's not
really,"what they're doing,"
6655.11,they're actually extracting
heat,from the body
6657.45,"to be technical, they're"
extracting,"heat from the body,"
6660.57,the only way they can do
that,is if those veins
6664.15,don't collapse and veins will collapse
6666.78,"if they are made very, very cold."
6668.83,So if you want to use
glabrous,skin cooling
6671.58,to offset hyperthermia
6672.89,"or for the other forms of performance,"
6674.47,"which we'll talk about in a moment,"
6676.22,you need to use a cool object or surface
6679.69,that is not so cold that
it,causes vasoconstriction.
6682.27,And this can be a little
bit,"tough to dial in,"
6684.76,meaning it can be tough to
identify,such an object.
6687.96,"And for that reason,"
6688.85,Dr. Heller and some of his
colleagues,have developed
6690.87,a commercial product called the CoolMitt.
6692.54,You can actually go to
their,"website, coolmitt.com."
6694.59,I don't have any financial or
other,relationship to them.
6697.83,I know they've been
developing,this technology
6699.56,for some period of time.
6700.47,It involves a glove that
you,"put your hand into,"
6703.58,it circulates water of a given
temperature,"and it does so,"
6707.8,and does so at a tempera
or,that is sure to not
6711.12,cause vasoconstriction of the palm.
6713.17,"And you may be asking,"
6714.003,how can you just put
your,hand into one glove
6716.22,and have this work?
6717.053,"Well, that's how powerful these"
glabrous,skin surfaces are.
6719.77,"Even just by cooling one palm,"
6722.85,the core body temperature drops radically.
6726.33,Now that's their commercial technology.
6728.96,I know that some people out
there,have started to experiment
6731.95,"with a home version of this,"
6733.1,which would be taking
a,package for instance
6735.64,of frozen blueberries
or,some other cold drink
6738.95,"or cold metal object, and"
actually,bringing it into the gym
6741.81,or out on a run.
6743.42,There are even people
who,are now developing
6745.13,cooled psych bicycle
handles,for long rides.
6749.23,This might seem a little
kooky,"or crazy to you,"
6751.32,but as you'll soon hear in the study
6753.8,"I'm about to describe,"
the,increases in endurance
6757.3,and in the volume of strength training
6759.89,that people can conduct
if,they appropriately cool
6763.3,their body through these
glabrous,skin portals
6766.19,is actually quite significant.
6768.41,"So again, as it relates to hyperthermia,"
6770.53,"if someone is overheating by all means,"
6772.88,"try and get them out of that heat,"
6774.25,"get them to stop exercising,"
you,"can die from hyperthermia,"
6777.65,"try and cool the bottoms of the feet,"
6779.08,the palms of their hands
6781.34,and the upper portion of their face.
6783.24,That does not mean it would be a bad idea
6786.48,to put cold water on
the,top of their head.
6788.2,That probably would also help
and,perhaps on their neck.
6790.69,What is probably not going
to,be a good idea is to do
6794.61,the more standard thing of
draping,someone in cold towels
6797.33,on the surface of their
body,"because as I mentioned,"
6799.22,"the beginning of the episode,"
6800.51,"that thermostat in the hypothalamus,"
6802.39,the medial preoptic area
will,typically react to that
6805.7,by increasing core body
temperature,further.
6808.27,The effects of glabrous skin
cooling,on physical performance
6811.59,are truly remarkable
6812.82,provided the glabrous skin
cooling,is done correctly.
6816.4,And I want to point out that
the,main degree of effect
6820.0,is on volume or the
ability,to do more work.
6824.22,And I want to point this out
because,"I think that many people,"
6827.69,certainly in the exercise
science,"community,"
6829.36,"but even in the general public,"
6830.55,when they hear about some of these effects
6832.46,"that are measured in the laboratory,"
6834.64,they sort of look at those
effects,a bit of scans
6839.13,"and they think, well, that's not possible."
6841.09,"Effects for instance,"
that,have been documented
6843.43,showing doubling or tripling
of,the number of dips
6845.9,that one can do in a
relatively,short amount of time
6848.81,or doubling of the number
of,pullups one can do
6851.81,or 14% increases in strength
or,even comparable degrees
6855.57,in increase in weight training output
6858.33,to people who are on
performance,"enhancing drugs,"
6860.45,"et cetera, et cetera."
6862.25,Part of the confusion is that the effects
6865.04,"of proper palmer cooling,"
6867.43,because it almost always
is,done by palmer cooling
6870.12,and less often in these experiments
6872.46,by cooling of the bottoms of the feet
6873.787,"and the upper portion of the face,"
6875.57,but those effects tend to be
the,ability to do more work
6881.54,over time and just to illustrate
some,of the major effects
6885.21,that the Heller lab is seen
6886.37,and they are document
entered,in this manuscript
6888.12,that I'll share with you in a moment.
6890.99,The typical protocol is
to,have people come in
6893.37,and do some endurance training
6894.77,so running on a treadmill
and,to have a condition where
6898.7,one group is actually doing palmer cooling
6901.02,while they are on a bike or on a treadmill
6903.64,and inevitably the outcome is
that,they can do more work.
6907.0,"They can pedal further at a given speed,"
6909.95,or they can run longer at
a,given speed than people
6913.19,who are not doing palmer cooling
6914.81,or who are receiving cooling by way of
6918.08,cold compress to the back
of,the neck or ice pack
6920.77,"to the armpits, et cetera."
6922.82,So the effects of palmer
cooling,are very clear
6925.07,and very robust.
6926.76,And in the context of endurance exercise
6929.59,almost always allow
people,"to do more work,"
6931.96,to go longer with less perceived
effort,and to quit later
6935.41,so to speak.
6937.16,"In terms of strength training,"
6938.81,they've looked at the capacity
to,perform sets of dips.
6942.58,So one of the more famous examples of this
6944.81,that Dr. Heller shares in the
episode,"that we did earlier,"
6948.8,and that you can find at
hubermanlab.com,involves
6951.66,someone coming in and doing
sets,"of dips, maybe 40 dips."
6955.94,This person actually could do
40,"dips on their first set,"
6958.36,then resting for a period
of,two to three minutes
6960.66,and then doing 35
6962.47,and then resting for a period
of,"two or three minutes,"
6964.53,and then doing progressively
fewer,and fewer and fewer
6966.87,"to the point where over a period of time,"
6969.43,they add up the total number
of,dips that they can do
6971.86,and then they have them come back
6974.26,"after a period of recovery,"
so,"not immediately after,"
6976.96,"but take a couple of days,"
6978.71,come back and do effectively
the,"same protocol,"
6981.57,"but during their rest periods,"
6982.93,they're doing two minutes
of,"palmer cooling,"
6985.92,which essentially allows
heat,"to move out of the body,"
6989.35,lowering core body
temperature,in other words.
6991.54,And what they find is that
they,see enormous increases
6995.35,in the total number of
dips,"that people can do,"
6997.34,but that doesn't mean that the person goes
6998.63,"from being able to do 40 dips,"
6999.91,to being able to do 50 dips
or,"60 dips on that first set,"
7003.12,what it means is they are able
to,"do 40 on the first set,"
7006.07,"then 40 on the second,"
7007.26,then 38 on the third
and,so on and so forth
7010.09,so that the total duration
of,the workout is extended
7012.93,"and yet they're doing much more work,"
7015.53,even though it takes more time.
7017.33,So that's an important point
7019.167,and I think a point that
perhaps,wasn't as clear
7022.84,or as clearly made by me
in,the previous episodes
7025.42,that discuss this topic.
7027.46,For those of you that are interested
7028.75,"in exploring palmer cooling, first of all,"
7031.45,I recommend taking a brief
glance,or even a deep dive
7035.09,"into this study,"
7037.09,which is entitled work volume
7038.6,and strength training
responses,to resistive exercise
7041.24,improve with periodic heat
extraction,from the palm.
7045.4,"In this study, they describe"
big,"increases in anaerobic,"
7050.85,"meaning strength training output,"
7052.66,"things like improvement in dips,"
7055.28,"improvement in bench press,"
7057.0,"improvement in pull-ups, et"
"cetera,",in human subjects.
7060.84,And it's a really nice study and points
7063.07,to some of the protocols
that,you might be able
7064.89,to adapt in your own setup.
7066.81,"For instance, over six"
weeks,"of pull up training,"
7068.92,palm cooling in between sets
improved,"volume by 144%,"
7074.64,and this was in experienced subjects.
7076.52,So that's interesting
because,a lot of studies
7078.89,of strength training and
improvements,in hypertrophy
7081.38,and strength are done in
inexperienced,"untrained athletes,"
7084.61,which changes the picture somewhat
7087.37,compared to experienced athletes.
7090.68,"They found that strength,"
7091.98,"meaning the one repetition maximum,"
7093.48,increased 22% over 10 weeks
in,bench press training.
7097.17,And they point to the
particularly,strong effects
7100.05,of using palmer cooling
when,people reach plateaus
7103.41,in endurance and strength training.
7105.12,"And there, I think it's"
an,important point.
7106.68,I think that if you're going
to,"explore palmer cooling,"
7110.3,it's probably not the sort of
thing,that you're going to do
7112.6,in every run or in every about of cycling
7116.05,"or in every strength training session,"
7118.64,but that it might be used to
vastly,increase your volume
7122.52,or vastly increase your endurance
7124.59,in a given session or a set of sessions
7126.7,in order to push through plateaus.
7129.1,A particularly interesting
point,in light of that
7131.66,is Dr. Heller has observed again and again
7134.71,that palmer cooling reduces
delayed,"onset muscle soreness,"
7137.65,or it can eliminate it entirely.
7139.49,And that's very interest because
it,also points to the fact
7142.07,that reducing core body
temperature,may somehow be involved
7145.35,in short circuiting
7146.2,the normal mechanisms of
delayed,onset muscle soreness.
7149.66,"And you might say, well,"
7150.54,how would temperature be involved
7152.38,in delayed onset muscle soreness?
7154.36,"Well, I want to refer you"
back,to the meta-analysis
7157.61,"that we talked about earlier,"
where,"the short duration,"
7160.39,very cold temperature exposure
after,training did indeed
7163.99,reduce delayed onset muscle soreness
7165.52,"in part through reduction,"
excuse,"me, in creatine kinase."
7168.99,So it's not inconceivable that temperature
7172.31,and delayed onset muscle
soreness,are related.
7175.0,And that raises perhaps
the,"most important point,"
7177.21,which is the way that palmer
cooling,can improve performance
7182.57,by way of reducing core
body,temperature is known
7186.11,and that is because when
one,engages in exercise
7190.4,"or muscular output of any kind,"
7192.12,"strength or endurance exercise,"
7194.93,the range of temperatures under
which,a muscle can perform
7198.41,is actually very narrow.
7200.61,"There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase,"
7202.8,which is critical to muscle contractions
7205.64,and pyruvate kinase can only function
7207.94,in a very narrow range of temperatures.
7209.81,"If that temperature gets too hot,"
7211.55,"meaning if the muscle heats up locally,"
7213.93,whether or not by running
7214.763,"or cycling or swimming or weightlifting,"
7217.99,the ability for that muscle to continue
7219.87,to contract is reduced and eventually
7222.16,is short circuited completely.
7223.95,And I think this is a much underexplored
7226.89,or at least a much under discussed aspect
7229.42,of so-called muscular
failure,or the failure
7232.29,of one to continue to endure in running.
7235.31,"So for instance,"
7236.143,when you run as compared to
a,"bench press or something,"
7238.75,you don't stop running
7239.95,because you can't actually
contract,"the muscles further,"
7242.47,but somehow signals about the heating up
7246.04,of muscular tissue are
conveyed,to the brain.
7248.74,"There's a crosstalk there,"
7249.76,it's probably bidirectional
and,"people stop, they quit."
7253.37,This is the quitting reflex.
7256.1,"In strength training, one can"
no,longer perform a repetition
7260.21,or set of repetitions in part
7261.76,because of heating up
of,the muscle locally.
7263.5,There are other mechanisms
as,"well, of course,"
7265.58,"and I realize that,"
7267.03,but what's very clear from the
palmer,cooling work is that
7270.39,"by simply holding onto a cool object,"
7273.26,remember not an object so cold
7274.91,that it constricts the
vessels,of the palms
7277.14,or constricts the vessels
on,"the bottoms of the feet,"
7280.07,but by holding onto a
relatively,cool object
7282.8,in one or both hands in between
sets,"for two minutes or so,"
7286.12,you can very efficiently reduce
your,core body temperature
7289.81,"and in doing so, reduce the"
temperature,of the muscles
7292.92,"that are doing the work,"
7295.09,increase the capacity for pyruvate kinase
7297.91,to continue to allow
your,muscles to contract
7300.8,and thereby allow you to
do,more volume of endurance
7304.01,and strength training.
7305.05,So a simple protocol that
Dr.,Heller passed to me
7308.24,is find a relatively cool object.
7311.61,"So you could, for instance,"
7312.67,"fill two bottles with cold water,"
7314.41,maybe put a few ice cubes in there.
7316.46,This is not exact because
we're,not talking about
7318.62,"the commercial CoolMitt product here,"
7320.06,we're talking about an at home version
7321.82,or use a pack of frozen
blueberries,or broccoli
7325.31,sort of pack of those
as,what he described.
7327.83,And then in between sets to put your hands
7330.42,and ideally you'd put
the,"bottoms of your feet,"
7332.12,but that's not always
feasible,in most gyms
7333.92,where they won't let you take
off,"your shoes and so forth,"
7336.22,but to put the palms of your
hands,on that cool surface
7339.16,for a minute or two minutes between sets
7342.57,and then returning to your sets of work.
7344.93,"Now, if you are heating up"
through,other mechanisms
7348.71,like you're wearing a stocking cap
7350.02,"and you're in a very warm environment,"
7351.54,this might not have as potent effect
7353.42,as if you were to do this cooling
7355.11,"in a more moderate environment,"
7356.77,"wearing lighter clothing, et cetera."
7358.7,So by all means warm
up,"to do your exercise,"
7361.51,"lubricate your joints,"
7362.49,and get into a place where you're
not,"going to injure yourself,"
7364.38,doing whatever form of exercise you do.
7366.45,But then if you'd like to
explore,"palmer cooling,"
7368.95,I know a number of people
who've,written to me saying
7371.16,they heard about palmer cooling
7372.26,on the episode with Dr. Heller.
7373.5,They've tried this and they
see,quite excellent results.
7376.66,It does take some discipline.
7378.25,It's one thing to just
kind,of hang out in the gym
7379.99,and play on your phone in between sets.
7381.28,It's another to do deliberate
cooling,with your palms
7384.14,or the bottom of your feet
7384.973,or the upper portion of your face.
7386.237,"You might get some weird looks,"
7387.92,but of course you'll be the one
7389.11,"doing significantly more volume,"
7391.09,not experiencing delayed onset
muscle,soreness and achieving
7394.56,better endurance and strength gains
7396.04,were you to do this properly.
7397.54,Now as a final topic related to the use
7399.96,of deliberate cold exposure
for,improving health
7402.65,"and performance, I'd like"
to,touch on this theme
7406.21,"that exists online, on social media,"
7408.33,on YouTube and in various
fitness,communities
7411.8,of using deliberate cold
exposure,"to the groin,"
7414.34,"in particular to the testicles,"
7416.36,in order to try and increase testosterone.
7419.31,"And while this might sound really kooky,"
7422.52,indeed this practice exists.
7424.4,"Indeed if you were to go onto Amazon,"
7427.15,there are actually ice pack underwear
7430.718,that are being marketed for
sake,of increasing testosterone.
7434.84,"Now, I am not aware of any"
specific,well-controlled studies
7437.84,that show that this indeed works.
7440.42,I can imagine based on what I
know,"about the nervous system,"
7443.74,"testosterone and cold, et cetera,"
7446.05,that there are a couple of mechanisms
7447.38,by which one might experience
increases,in testosterone
7451.04,as a consequence of
deliberate,cold exposure.
7453.16,"First off, let me say"
there,is no reason why
7455.15,you would have to apply these ice packs
7458.0,in the way that I just described.
7460.41,One could of course take a cold shower.
7462.25,One could of course use cold
immersion,"of various kinds,"
7466.32,and you're still going
to,get that exposure
7468.7,of the groin and the testicles to cold.
7471.43,Now I should point out
that,people do report
7474.72,at least anecdotally
increases,in testosterone
7478.49,as a consequence of this practice
7480.04,and I have to imagine
7481.22,that they are measuring
their,"serum testosterone,"
7483.08,that they're not just guessing
7484.08,that their testosterone went up.
7486.46,If you know of a study
exploring,"this directly,"
7488.53,"please let me know, put in the"
comment,"section on YouTube,"
7491.55,or even just email me.
7493.2,We have a email that you can
find,"it, hubermanlab.com."
7497.42,Please email me the reference.
7498.91,"I wasn't able to find a reference,"
7500.63,but I can imagine two
reasonably,plausible mechanisms
7504.26,by which deliberate cold
exposure,"to the groin,"
7507.57,"in particular the testicles,"
would,increase testosterone.
7510.77,"The first is somewhat direct,"
7513.28,which is that anytime
you,"cool a body surface,"
7517.11,"that if it's cold enough,"
7518.53,you're going to get vasoconstriction.
7520.32,And then subsequently you're going to get
7521.96,"a rebound increase in vasodilation,"
7524.73,meaning you're going to constrict
7526.02,the blood vessels in that area.
7527.45,"And then after the cold is removed,"
7529.56,there's going to be more
blood,flow to that area.
7531.939,"And of course,"
7532.938,blood flow relates to organ health
7534.5,and tissue health generally.
7535.84,So perfusion of that region
and,the gonads to be specific
7541.55,"with additional blood,"
7542.91,you could imagine in some
ways,"increasing testosterone,"
7546.24,that's reasonably plausible.
7548.34,The other probably more likely mechanism
7551.06,relates to the dopamine
increases,caused by cold exposure
7554.94,that we talked about earlier.
7556.34,"Again, anytime you have a"
somewhat,"stressful stimulus,"
7559.69,"but in particular with cold exposure,"
7561.48,"it seems that the catecholamines,"
7563.3,"norepinephrine, epinephrine"
and,dopamine all increase
7567.36,and dopamine is known to be in the pathway
7570.84,that can stimulate testosterone.
7573.1,And so while there isn't
a,direct relationship
7575.13,"between dopamine stimulating testosterone,"
7577.3,there is an interesting
pathway,way whereby
7579.08,dopamine increases can trigger increases
7581.33,"in things like luteinizing hormone,"
7583.35,which can trigger
increases,in testosterone
7586.1,as well as estrogen for that matter.
7588.19,So I know that there are
a,lot of people out there
7590.22,that are interested in
the,use of cold exposure
7592.01,for increasing testosterone.
7593.4,And some of those people
in,communities are
7596.39,indeed using cold exposure
directly,"on the gonads,"
7600.28,on the testees in order to do this.
7602.46,I'm not certain that that
direct,contact is necessary.
7606.4,And in some cases it might
actually,be quite dangerous
7611.07,or you at least should be
careful,in terms of tissues there
7614.12,and avoiding damage.
7615.81,"But nonetheless, I think"
that,a dopamine impact
7619.92,on testosterone is very likely
given,the 250% increases
7624.07,in dopamine that have been observed
7625.34,with cold water immersion and
all,of that points to the fact
7627.68,that cold water immersion
7630.73,"very likely increases testosterone,"
7633.36,but as a downstream consequence
7635.3,of the cold water immersion
effects,on dopamine
7638.18,"and luteinizing hormone,"
7639.55,and again there's no reason
to,think that the increases
7642.26,in luteinizing hormone would
also,increase estrogen.
7645.29,Probably not to dangerous or levels
7649.35,"that one would want to avoid,"
7651.6,but I don't think that there's anything
7653.19,particularly specific about cold
7655.68,for inducing testosterone
and,not other hormones.
7658.18,I think it's very likely to increases
7659.56,a number of different hormones.
7661.57,I do hope that there will be
a,systematic study on this
7664.32,in the not too distant future.
7665.85,I also hope to not be a subject
7667.76,in the cooling of the gonads experiment.
7670.4,Now I promise you the last
topic,"was the last topic,"
7672.59,but there's one other
really,important point
7674.62,that I think everyone should be aware of
7676.44,if you're going to use
deliberate,cold exposure.
7679.07,And that brings us back
to,the very first thing
7681.97,"that we discussed today,"
7683.51,along the lines of
deliberate,"cold exposure,"
7685.21,which is that your baseline temperature
7687.2,is going to be lowest about
two,"hours before you wake up,"
7691.49,it's going to increase in the morning
7693.76,and as you wake up
7695.07,and increase throughout
the,"day and afternoon,"
7697.28,and then start to drop in the
evening,and come down at night
7700.39,as you head to sleep.
7703.01,I also want you to remember
that,if you are to cool
7706.52,the external portion of your
"body,","in particular your torso,"
7710.37,the net effect of that is
going,to be an increase
7713.83,in body temperature.
7715.51,"So for many people, not"
"all,","but for many people,"
7718.94,if you are going to do
deliberate,"cold exposure,"
7722.01,you are going to increase
your,core body temperature
7725.22,and that makes sense
7726.053,if you think about how
deliberate,cold exposure
7728.64,can increase metabolism by
increasing,thermogenesis.
7732.44,What that all means is
that,if you are doing
7736.12,your deliberate cold
exposure,"early in the day,"
7738.74,you are going to get
yet,a further increase
7741.53,in core body temperature
7743.08,"that would be associated with wakefulness,"
7745.66,your ability to be alert that morning
7747.49,or throughout the day and so on.
7750.32,It also means that if you do
your,deliberate cold exposure
7753.92,"very late in the evening, or at night,"
7756.33,"so 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM and so on,"
7761.34,you are going to increase
your,core body temperature
7763.787,"and if you recall,"
7765.83,a decrease in core body temperature
7767.64,of one to three degrees
is,"not just beneficial,"
7771.35,but is necessary in order
to,get into deep sleep
7774.38,and remain in deep sleep.
7776.41,So the takeaway from this
is,deliberate cold exposure
7779.73,done properly will increase
your,core body temperature
7782.28,and make you feel more alert.
7784.27,"So if you're doing it early in the day,"
7786.23,that's probably terrific
7788.21,given that most of us want
to,be alert during the day.
7790.99,"However, if you do it too late"
in,"the day, evening or night,"
7794.56,it can disrupt sleep by way of disrupting
7797.04,your core body temperature.
7798.82,"Now, the caveat to that is I myself"
7802.36,tend to do deliberate cold
exposure,early in the day.
7805.19,Maybe not first thing in the
"morning,","but mid morning,"
7807.6,maybe as late as three
or,four in the afternoon
7809.63,in some cases.
7810.463,"In the longer days of summer,"
I,"might do it even later,"
7812.8,five or 6:00 PM and have
no,trouble sleeping.
7815.65,I have done deliberate cold
exposure,"very late at night,"
7818.97,"10:00 PM, 11:00 PM and so on"
7821.78,as part of a 30 day challenge
7823.23,of doing deliberate cold
exposure,every day for 30 days
7825.99,and I got sloppy with my timing
7827.57,"and then in order to not miss a day,"
7829.34,I would do it at 11 o'clock at night.
7831.01,And I must say
7831.91,I found that I could still
fall,"asleep very easily,"
7835.37,even doing deliberate cold
exposure,very late at night.
7838.1,"However, on those particular"
"days,",I was particularly busy
7842.32,and so I was particularly
exhausted,when I arrived
7845.61,at the deliberate cold exposure
7846.9,and I had no trouble falling asleep
7849.14,"after doing deliberate cold exposure,"
7850.6,and then taking a nice warm
shower,and then going to sleep.
7853.05,But I could imagine that
because,of the increases
7856.06,in core body temperature caused
by,"deliberate cold exposure,"
7859.38,that were one to do that
too,"late in the day,"
7862.1,evening or night that it could
indeed,disrupt your sleep.
7864.91,So my recommendation would be
7866.24,for most people only do
deliberate,cold exposure
7869.25,if you are prepared to be
fairly,alert for the next one
7872.75,to four or maybe had been six hours
7874.91,following that deliberate cold exposure.
7877.04,"So for today's episode,"
7878.24,as is the case with most episodes
7880.18,"of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
I,covered a lot of material.
7883.22,We talked about mechanisms
of,catecholamines and stress
7885.99,and pulsatile release of
"epinephrine,","metabolism,"
7889.48,"mental effects, performance,"
glabrous,skin cooling
7891.947,and on and on and on.
7893.92,And while the goal of course
is,to make sure that everyone
7897.03,"arrives at specific,"
7898.54,very clear mechanistic
and,"actionable protocols,"
7901.8,I do realize that it is an
immense,amount of information.
7904.82,"And for that reason,"
7905.68,I've created a list of deliberate
cold,exposure protocols
7909.97,aimed at improving mental
toughness,"and resilience,"
7913.7,"mood, performance, metabolism,"
reducing,"inflammation,"
7918.1,and so on and so forth.
7919.49,All of those have been
condensed,into succinct form
7922.74,and can be found at the Huberman Lab
7925.21,Neural Network Newsletter.
7926.92,This is a monthly or
semi-monthly,newsletter
7929.42,that we release
7930.253,that includes takeaways from
the,podcast and protocols.
7933.7,You can access those
as,protocols zero cost
7936.52,"by simply going to hubermanlab.com,"
7939.11,signing up for the neural
network,newsletter.
7940.93,"It's very easy to do, you"
just,supply your email
7943.23,and you will receive the newsletter.
7944.97,We do not share your
email,with anybody else.
7947.83,"In fact, we have our"
privacy,policy laid out
7950.78,on the hubermanlab.com website
7952.95,so you can find that
there,and the protocols
7955.87,that I've designed should
make,it very straightforward
7958.12,for you to create a set of protocols
7961.33,that you could use with cold
"showers,","with cold immersion,"
7963.62,with or without ice in
combination,with exercise
7966.36,"specifically for one goal or another,"
7967.96,or to accomplish multiple
goals,simultaneously.

8013.8,On many previous episodes
of,"the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
8016.39,we talk about supplements.
8017.86,While supplements aren't
necessary,"for everybody,"
8019.97,many people derive
tremendous,"benefit from them,"
8022.21,for things like sleep and focus
8023.98,and other aspects of
health,and performance.
8026.52,One issue with the supplement industry
8028.01,"that's very serious, however,"
8029.63,is that these supplement companies simply
8032.02,do not use high quality ingredients
8033.85,or the amounts of the ingredients
they,list on the packaging
8037.22,does not match what's actually
contained,in their product.
8039.83,"For that reason,"
8040.663,"we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,"
8043.57,because Thorne supplements
8044.78,are known to be of the very
highest,quality ingredients
8047.35,and the very highest degree
of,specificity in terms of
8050.97,the amounts of the ingredients
8052.19,that are listed on the packaging
8053.75,accurately match what's
contained,in their products.
8056.67,If you'd like to see the
Thorne,"products that I take,"
8058.59,"you can go to Thorne, that's"
thorne.com/u/huberman.,
8064.107,"And there, you can see the Thorne products"
8065.72,that I take and get 20%
off,any of those products.
8068.62,"In addition, if you navigate"
deeper,"into the Thorne site,"
8071.08,"through that portal, Thorne,"
"thorne.com/u/huberman,",
8076.41,you can also get 20% off
8077.79,any of the other products
that,Thorne makes.
8080.07,If you're not already
subscribed,to Huberman Lab
8082.19,"on Instagram and Twitter, please do so."
8084.47,There I cover science
and,science related tools
8086.92,that sometimes overlap with
the,"content of the podcast,"
8089.64,but oftentimes is distinct
from,the information
8091.94,covered on this podcast.
8093.61,So thank you once again
8094.69,for joining me in the
discussion,about the use
8097.18,of deliberate cold exposure
for,health and performance
8099.97,"and last but certainly not least,"
8102.25,thank you for your interest in science.
