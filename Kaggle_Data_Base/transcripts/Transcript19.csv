0.36,- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast 
2.07,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.92,for everyday life. 
6.218,[upbeat music] 
9.15,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.17,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.26,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.21,"Today, my guest is Dr. Eddie Chang. "
17.64,Dr. Eddie Chang is the chair of the neurosurgery department 
20.46,at the University of California at San Francisco. 
23.76,Dr. Chang's clinical group focuses on the treatment 
26.34,of movement disorders including epilepsy. 
29.19,He is also a world expert 
30.6,in the treatment of speech disorders 
32.37,and relieving paralysis that prevents speech 
34.8,and other forms of movement and communication. 
37.35,"Indeed, his laboratory is credited with discovering ways "
40.5,"to allow people who have fully locked-in syndrome, "
43.11,"that is, who cannot speak or move, "
45.09,to communicate through computers and AI devices 
48.27,in order to be able to speak to others in their world 
51.03,and understand what others are saying to them. 
53.76,"It is a truly remarkable achievement that we discuss today, "
56.61,"in addition to his discoveries about critical periods, "
58.8,which are periods of time during one's life 
60.9,"when one can learn things, in particular, languages, "
63.39,"with great ease as opposed to later in life, "
65.91,and we talk about the basis of things 
67.59,like bilingualism and trilingualism. 
70.17,We talk about how the brain controls movement 
72.48,of the very muscles that allow for speech and language 
75.03,and how those can be modified over time. 
77.13,"We also talk about stutter, "
78.51,and we talk about a number of aspects of speech and language 
81.24,that give insight into not just how we create 
83.55,this incredible thing called speech 
85.05,"or how we understand speech and language, "
87.33,but how the brain works more generally. 
89.37,Dr. Chang is also one of the world leaders 
91.2,"in bioengineering, "
92.58,"that is, the creation of devices that allow the brain "
95.55,to function at supraphysiological levels 
98.07,and that can allow people 
99.24,with various syndromes and disorders 
100.86,to overcome their deficits. 
102.81,So if you are somebody who is interested 
104.4,"in how the brain works normally, "
106.35,"how it breaks down and how it can be repaired, "
108.93,"and if you are interested in speech and language, "
111.75,"reading and comprehension of information of any kind, "
114.63,today's episode ought to include some information 
116.88,of deep interest to you. 
118.62,Dr. Chang is indeed the top of his field 
121.35,in terms of understanding these issues 
123.06,of how the brain encodes speech and language 
124.98,and creates speech and language 
126.84,"and, as I mentioned, movement disorders and epilepsy. "
129.81,"We even talk about things such as the ketogenic diet, "
132.18,"the future of companies like Neuralink, "
134.46,which are interested in bioengineering 
136.53,"and augmenting the human brain, and much more. "
139.8,One thing that I would like to note is that in addition 
141.9,to being a world-class neuroscience researcher 
144.3,"and world-class clinician, neurosurgeon, "
146.82,"and chair of neurosurgery, "
148.5,"Dr. Eddie Chang has also been a close, personal friend "
151.26,of mine since we were nine years old. 
153.48,"We attended elementary school together, "
155.22,and we actually had a science club 
157.5,when we were nine years old 
158.55,focused on a very particular topic. 
160.23,You'll have to listen in to today's episode 
161.94,to discover what that topic was 
163.47,and what membership to that club required. 
166.77,"That aside, Dr. Chang is an absolute phenom "
170.4,"with respect to his scientific prowess, "
172.38,"that is, both his research and his clinical abilities, "
175.41,and he's one of these rare individuals 
177.33,"that, whenever he opens his mouth, we learn. "
180.48,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
183.09,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
185.79,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
187.71,to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information 
189.57,about science and science-related tools 
191.64,to the general public. 
192.9,"In keeping with that theme, "
193.95,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
196.71,Our first sponsor is Levels. 
198.57,Levels is a program 
199.53,that helps you see how different foods affect your health 
201.72,by giving you real-time feedback on your diet 
203.94,using a continuous glucose monitor. 
206.46,I started using Levels about one year ago. 
209.64,The Levels monitor allowed me to see how different foods 
212.04,change my blood sugar level or my blood glucose level. 
215.13,This turns out to be immensely important 
216.93,"for being able to predict how, for instance, certain foods "
219.63,"will affect your energy level, your ability to exercise, "
222.6,"your ability to recover from exercise, "
224.46,and how it will affect other hormones 
226.2,"like testosterone, estrogen, thyroid hormone, and so forth. "
230.01,The other thing about using a Levels monitor 
232.08,is that it gave me insight into how food and exercise 
235.08,and other activities and even how well I was sleeping 
237.18,or how poorly I might happen to be sleeping 
239.61,impact my blood glucose levels. 
241.56,"It even taught me that the sauna, "
243.51,"that generating a lot of heat in my body, "
246.0,"was changing my blood glucose levels, "
247.95,which turned out to inform 
249.21,"how I should shift my eating patterns, foods I should eat, "
251.94,"timing of eat, and so on and so forth. "
253.86,It really gave me great insight 
255.0,into how all the important aspects of my health 
257.49,"were interlocking and affecting one another, "
259.29,not just how food was impacting my blood glucose. 
262.38,So if you're interested in learning more about Levels 
264.24,"and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself, "
266.88,you can go to levels.link/huberman. 
269.67,That's levels.link/huberman. 
272.1,Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. 
274.77,Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers 
276.45,"with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. "
279.48,I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover 
281.67,"a few months ago, and it is simply incredible. "
284.46,"In fact, I don't even like traveling anymore "
286.26,because they don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers 
288.72,in hotels and Airbnbs. 
290.49,One of the reasons 
291.323,"I love my Eight Sleep mattress cover so much is that, "
293.94,"as you might have heard before on this podcast or elsewhere, "
296.52,"in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, "
298.83,you need your body temperature to drop 
300.36,"by about one to three degrees, "
301.95,"and I tend to run warm at night, "
303.99,which makes it hard to sleep 
305.1,and sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night. 
307.08,"When you sleep on an Eight Sleep mattress cover, "
308.73,you can program the temperature of that mattress cover 
311.34,"for specific times in the early, middle, "
313.59,and late part of your night 
315.0,"so that the mattress stays cool, "
316.68,"and as a consequence, you sleep very, very deeply. "
319.35,"It also tracks your sleep, "
321.03,"so it's paying attention to how many times you're moving, "
323.37,"how deep your sleep is, it gives you a sleep score, "
325.62,all wonderful data to help you enhance your sleep. 
327.78,"And of course, sleep is the foundation "
329.52,"of mental health, physical health, and performance, "
331.77,which makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool 
333.69,for enhancing not just your sleep 
335.37,but all aspects of your life really. 
337.56,If you're interested 
338.393,"in trying the Eight Sleep mattress cover, "
339.6,you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman 
342.12,to check out the Pod 
3,"cover, "
343.62,and you can save $
150,at checkout. 
346.02,"Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, to Canada, the UK, "
349.68,and select countries in the EU and Australia. 
351.9,"Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman "
354.33,to save $
150,at checkout. 
356.58,Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
359.67,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
362.01,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
364.62,to help you better understand your body 
366.27,and help you reach your health goals. 
367.98,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
370.65,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
372.96,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
375.09,can only be analyzed with a quality blood test. 
377.76,One problem with a lot of DNA tests 
379.83,"and blood tests, however, "
380.88,"is you get data back about levels of metabolic factors, "
384.33,"levels of hormones, et cetera, "
385.95,but you don't know what to do with that information. 
387.84,InsideTracker makes interpreting your data 
389.52,and knowing what to do about it exceedingly easy. 
392.73,They have a personalized platform 
394.32,where you can go and you can see those levels 
396.0,"of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera, "
398.37,"and they point to specific nutritional tools, "
400.8,"behavioral tools, supplement-based tools, et cetera, "
403.8,that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges 
405.81,that are optimal for you. 
407.01,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "
408.42,you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman 
411.33,to get 
20%,off any of InsideTracker's plans. 
414.18,"Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get "
20%,off. 
418.38,The Huberman Lab podcast 
419.52,is now partnered with Momentous Supplements. 
421.35,To find the supplements we discuss 
422.7,"on the Huberman Lab podcast, "
423.9,"you can go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, "
426.84,livemomentous.com/huberman. 
428.817,And I should just mention 
429.81,that the library of those supplements 
431.13,is constantly expanding. 
432.66,"Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. "
435.87,And now for my discussion with Dr. Eddie Chang. 
438.81,"Eddie, welcome. "
439.74,"- Hi. Hi, Andrew. "
441.24,- Great to be here with you. 
442.65,This has been a long time coming. 
445.23,"Just to come clean, "
447.6,we've known each other since we were nine years old. 
449.67,- Yeah. 
450.503,- But then there was a long gap 
451.53,in which we didn't talk to one another. 
453.84,"I heard things about you, "
455.1,"and, presumably, you heard a thing or two about me, "
458.16,for better or for worse. [Eddie laughs] 
459.48,And then we reconnected years later 
461.76,when I was a PhD student and you were a medical student. 
464.7,We literally ran into each other 
466.38,in the halls of the University of California San Francisco 
469.08,"where you're now the chair of neurosurgery, "
470.82,so it all comes full circle. 
473.58,"When you were at UCSF, you were working with Mike Merzenich, "
476.85,and I know that name 
477.683,"might not be familiar to a lot of people, "
479.13,"but he's sort of synonymous with neuroplasticity, "
482.31,the ability of the brain and nervous system 
483.87,to change in response to experience. 
485.97,"So for our listeners, "
486.84,I would just love for you to give a brief overview 
489.84,of what you were doing at that time 
491.22,"because I find that work so fascinating, "
492.99,and it really points to some of the things that can promote 
496.44,and maybe hinder our brain's ability to change. 
500.04,"- Oh, wow. That's fantastic. "
502.65,"So we did bump into each other serendipitously back then, "
506.61,"and, at the time, I was a medical student at UCSF "
510.3,studying with Mike Merzenich. 
511.58,"In particular, I was studying how the brain organizes "
517.74,when you have patterns of sound. 
520.11,"And in particular, we were studying the brain of rodents "
523.8,and trying to understand how different sound patterns 
525.78,organize the frequency representation 
529.08,from low to middle to high frequency maps 
532.05,in the brains of baby rodents. 
534.24,And one of the things that I was very interested in 
537.03,was trying to understand 
537.87,"how the patterns of the natural environment, "
541.5,let's say the vocalizations of the environment 
543.93,"that the rat pups were raised in, "
545.97,"or just the natural sounds that they hear, "
547.8,how that shapes the structure of the brain. 
551.61,And one of the things we did was to try an experiment 
554.85,"where we raised some of these rat pups in white noise, "
559.05,continuous white noise that was essentially masking 
562.17,all of those environmental sounds. 
564.66,- And what was the consequence of animals being raised 
567.21,in white noise environment? 
568.77,"- Well, one of the things that we didn't expect "
570.66,"but we found, which was quite striking, "
572.67,is that there's this early period in brain development 
577.71,where we're very susceptible 
579.6,to the patterns that we hear or see. 
582.42,"In neuroscience, we call this a critical period "
584.7,or a sensitive period. 
586.83,"And we have this for our eyes, "
589.26,but we also have it for our ears. 
591.06,And one of the most striking examples of this 
594.66,is that any human can essentially grow up in a culture 
598.29,where they hear different speech sounds 
600.24,"from one language to another, "
601.77,"and it's like after a couple of years, "
603.87,you lose sensitivity to sounds 
605.91,that are not part of your native language 
607.62,and you have high sensitivity 
610.347,for the languages of your native culture. 
613.08,And that's pretty extraordinary 
616.02,that human brain has that flexibility 
618.96,"yet, at the same time, has that specialization for language. "
622.29,"And so we were trying to think about how do we model this, "
625.38,"for example, in rodents, who obviously don't speak, "
628.53,but we're just understanding how sounds 
631.68,and environmental sounds 
633.03,modulate and organize the auditory cortex. 
636.21,And one of the things that we found that was quite striking 
638.82,was that if you basically mask environmental sounds 
643.83,"from these rat pups, "
646.2,"the critical period, "
647.64,"this sensitive period where it's open to plasticity, "
650.82,"it's open to change, it's open to reorganization, "
655.44,"that window can stay open much, much longer. "
659.014,"And in one way, it sounds like that's a good thing, "
661.41,"but on the other hand, it's also a retardation. "
665.25,It actually slowed the maturation of the auditory cortex. 
669.09,"It was ready to close when these rat pups were really young, "
673.05,"but by raising them in white noise, "
674.73,we found out that you could keep it open 
677.28,for months beyond the time period that it normally closes. 
682.23,And so I think one of the things it taught me 
684.51,was that it's not just about the genetic programming 
688.62,"that specifies some of this sensitive period, "
691.35,but it's also a little bit about the nature 
693.9,of the sounds that we hear 
696.03,that help keep that window for the critical period 
698.97,open and closed. 
700.44,- That's fascinating. 
701.28,And I know it's difficult to make a direct leap 
703.5,"from animal research to human research, "
706.23,"but if we could speculate a little bit, "
709.65,I can imagine that some people grow up in homes 
711.54,"where there's a lot of shouting and a lot of inflection, "
714.66,maybe people are very verbose. 
716.46,Maybe others grow up in a home 
718.23,where it's quieter and more peaceful. 
722.07,Some people are going to grow up in cities. 
723.87,"I just came back from New York City, "
724.98,"it's like all night long, "
726.18,"there's honking and sirens and it's just nonstop, "
729.3,and then I return here where it's quite quiet at night. 
733.8,Can we imagine that the human brain 
736.05,is going to be shaped differently 
737.31,depending on whether or not one grows up 
739.41,in one environment or another? 
740.52,And would that impact their tendency 
743.49,to speak in a certain way as well as hear in a certain way? 
746.93,What do we know about that? 
748.14,"- Well, I think that, from my perspective, "
752.58,it's really clear that those sounds that we are exposed to 
756.39,"from the very earliest time, even in utero, in the womb, "
760.74,where the sound is hearing the mother or father or friends 
765.45,while in the womb 
766.283,actually will influence how these things organize. 
770.87,And so there's no question that the sounds that we hear 
774.36,"are going to have some influence, "
775.62,and those sounds are going to structure 
778.17,the way that those neural networks actually lay down 
780.84,"and will forever influence how you hear sounds, "
785.16,and speech and language 
786.21,is probably one of the most profound examples of that. 
789.87,- I get a lot of questions 
790.8,about the use of white noise during sleep. 
793.86,"In particular, people want to know "
795.24,whether or not using a white noise machine 
797.55,or a machine or a program 
799.59,"that makes the sound of waves, for instance, "
801.6,"if it assists their infant in sleeping, "
804.36,is it going to be bad for them 
805.83,because it's flooding the auditory system 
807.9,with a bunch of essentially white noise 
809.94,or disorganized noise? 
812.37,Do we have an answer to that question? 
814.8,- Not yet. 
815.633,I think that what you're asking 
816.81,is a really important question 
818.31,because parents are using white noise generators 
821.79,"almost universally now, and for good reasons. "
824.76,"You know, it is hard to have kids up at night. "
827.43,I've got three kids of my own and was very tempted 
831.12,to think about how to use some of these tools 
833.34,"to just soothe them and get them to bed, "
835.89,"especially when I was, like, so tired and exhausted. "
840.36,"But I think that there is a cost, "
843.18,"you know, to think a little bit about. "
844.62,"You know, we're not exposed "
846.69,to continuous white noise naturally. 
850.47,"There is a value to having really salient, structured sounds "
854.94,that are part of our natural environment 
856.19,to actually have the brain develop normally. 
858.9,"So whether or not that has an impact, "
862.74,"you know, while you're sleeping, it's not clear. "
866.22,I don't think that those studies have been done. 
868.41,What was really clear was that if you raise these baby rats 
872.91,"in continuous white noise, not super loud, "
875.43,but just enough to mask the environmental sounds 
878.43,"that that was enough to keep, you know, the auditory cortex, "
881.88,"the part of the brain that hears, "
884.22,in this really delayed state 
885.66,which could essentially slow down the development 
888.48,and maturation of the brain. 
890.52,- And one could probably assume 
893.1,that slowing the maturation of areas of the brain 
895.773,that are responsible for hearing 
897.48,"might, I want to underscore, "
898.86,"might impact one's ability to speak, right? "
901.23,"Because isn't it the case that if people can't hear, "
904.8,they actually have a harder time enunciating 
907.26,"in a particular way, is that right? "
909.12,"If I were to not be able to hear my own voice, "
912.12,would my speech patterns change? 
914.94,"- Well, I think part of it "
916.04,"is that, over time, we develop sensitivity "
919.23,"to the very specific speech sounds in a given language, "
922.59,and the sensitivity improves 
926.4,as we hear more and more and more of it. 
928.527,"And then on the other hand, "
930.3,we lose sensitivity to other speech sounds at the same time. 
933.72,"But as part of that process, "
935.52,"we also have a selectivity, a gain, "
939.9,"a specialization even for those sounds, "
944.25,"even relative to noise, "
946.29,noisy backgrounds and things like that. 
948.42,I tend to think about it 
949.59,like what is the signal-to-noise ratio? 
952.59,And so the brain has its own ways 
955.23,of trying to increase that signal-to-noise ratio 
958.5,in order to make it more clear. 
960.72,Part of that is how we hear 
963.537,and how it lays down a foundation 
965.49,"for that signal-to-noise ratio, "
967.2,and so you can imagine a child 
970.133,that's raised continuously in white noise 
973.23,would be really deprived of those kind of sounds 
975.75,that are really necessary for it to develop properly. 
978.51,"So I think with regard to those tools for babies, "
983.16,"I think we should study it, "
984.57,we should try to understand this definitively. 
986.37,I think what we saw in rodents 
988.14,"would tell us that there is potential, "
990.66,"you know, things that we should be concerned about. "
992.52,"But, again, it's not really clear, "
994.08,"if you're just using at night, whether it has those effects. "
997.802,- I guess the critical question 
998.88,that a number of people are going to be asking 
1001.46,is did you decide to use a white noise machine or not 
1006.35,to help keep any of your three children asleep? 
1010.97,"- Well, I think the short answer is no. "
1013.67,"I mean, I obviously did a lot of work thinking "
1016.01,"and work on this and thought about it carefully, "
1019.64,"but there are other kinds of noise, "
1023.54,"or, I wouldn't even call it noise, "
1025.37,other sounds that you can use 
1026.873,that can be equally soothing to a baby. 
1029.93,"It's just that white noise has no structure, "
1032.15,and what it's doing 
1033.08,is essentially masking out all of the natural sounds. 
1036.65,And I think the goal 
1037.91,should really be about how do we replace that 
1040.52,with other more natural sounds that structure the brain 
1042.74,in the way that we want to be more healthy. 
1046.13,"- Well, I know that "
1047.33,"after you finished your medical training, "
1049.52,"you went on to, of course, specialize in neurosurgery. "
1052.28,"And last I checked, you spend most of your days "
1056.36,either running your laboratory or in the clinic 
1058.19,"or running the department, "
1059.42,and your clinical work and your laboratory work 
1061.46,involves often removing pieces of the skull of humans 
1066.17,and going in and either removing things 
1068.56,"or stimulating neurons, "
1071.27,"treating various ailments of different kinds, "
1074.78,"but your main focus these days, of course, "
1077.75,is the neurobiology of speech and language. 
1081.92,"And so for those that aren't familiar, "
1083.57,could you please distinguish for us speech versus language 
1087.77,in terms of whether or not 
1089.6,different brain areas control them? 
1091.64,And I know that there's a lot of interest 
1093.8,in how speech and language and hearing 
1096.23,all relate to one another. 
1098.18,And then we'll talk a bit 
1099.59,"about, for instance, emotions "
1102.11,"and how facial expressions could play into this, "
1104.51,"or hand gestures, et cetera. "
1106.49,"But for the uninformed person, "
1109.49,"and for me, to be quite direct, "
1113.78,what are the brain areas that control speech and language? 
1118.16,"What are they really, "
1119.63,"and especially in humans, how are they different? "
1121.73,"I mean, we have such sophisticated language "
1124.43,compared to a number of other species. 
1126.44,What does all this landscape look like in there? 
1128.69,"- Yeah, well, that's a fascinating question, "
1132.65,"and I'm going to just try to connect a couple of the dots here, "
1135.89,"which is that in that earlier work during medical school, "
1140.06,"I was doing a lot of what we call neurophysiology, "
1142.73,putting electrodes into the auditory cortex 
1144.89,"and understanding how the brain responds to sounds, "
1148.43,and that's how we actually mapped out these things 
1150.98,about the sensitivity to sensitive periods. 
1154.25,That experience with Mike Merzenich 
1157.25,and thinking about how plasticity is regulated in the brain 
1160.64,and particular about how sound 
1163.1,is represented by brain activity 
1164.96,"was something that, you know, was really formative for me. "
1168.74,And because I was a medical student 
1170.69,"and was going back to my medical studies, "
1173.87,it was that in combination 
1175.64,with seeing some awake brain surgeries 
1180.8,that our department is really well known for. 
1183.05,"One of my mentors, Mitch Berger, "
1184.61,really pioneered these methods 
1186.35,for taking care of patients with brain tumor 
1188.48,and be able to do these surgeries safely 
1192.23,by keeping patients awake and by mapping out language. 
1195.47,"- So they're talking and listening, "
1197.03,and you're essentially in conversation with these patients 
1199.25,"while there's a portion of their skull removed, "
1201.53,and you are stimulating 
1202.58,"or, in some cases, removing areas of their brain, "
1205.63,is that right? 
1207.08,"- That's exactly right, and the only thing off there "
1210.44,"is it's not essentially, it is just that. "
1213.11,The only difference between the conversation 
1215.51,that I might have with my patient 
1216.68,who's undergoing awake brain surgery 
1219.14,is that I can't see their face and they can't see my face. 
1223.1,We actually have a sterile drape 
1225.65,"that actually separates the operating field, "
1227.45,and they're looking and interacting 
1228.8,"with our neuropsychologist, "
1230.42,but I can talk to them and they can hear my voice 
1233.24,and vice versa. 
1234.83,"And it's a really, really important way "
1236.6,of how we can protect some of those areas 
1238.853,"that are really critical for language, "
1241.4,"at the same time, accomplish a mission "
1243.62,of getting the seizures under control 
1245.24,or getting a brain tumor removed. 
1246.95,- And is that because occasionally 
1248.06,"you'll encounter a brain area, "
1249.41,maybe you're stimulating 
1250.46,"or considering removing that brain area, "
1252.62,and suddenly a patient will start stuttering 
1256.1,or will have a hard time formulating a sentence? 
1258.53,Is that essentially what you're looking for? 
1260.69,You're looking for regions 
1263.27,in which it is okay or not okay to probe? 
1266.51,"- Exactly, so the first thing that we do "
1269.33,is that we use a small electrical stimulator 
1271.73,to probe different parts of the areas 
1273.56,that we think might be related and important for language 
1276.89,or talking or even movements of your arm and leg. 
1279.92,That's what we call brain mapping. 
1281.45,And we use a small electrical current 
1284.54,that's delivered through a probe 
1285.95,that we can just put at each spot. 
1288.38,And the areas that we're really interested in 
1289.82,"are, of course, the areas that are right around the part "
1292.91,"that is pathological, the part that's injured, "
1295.37,"or the part that has a brain tumor that we want to remove, "
1298.34,so we can apply that probe 
1299.72,"and transiently, meaning temporarily, activate it. "
1304.01,So if you're stimulating the part of the brain 
1306.083,"that controls the hand, the hand will move, it will jerk. "
1310.04,"Sometimes a fist will be made, something like that. "
1313.43,"Other times, while someone is counting "
1317.57,"or just saying the days of the week, "
1319.16,you can stimulate in a different area 
1321.56,that stops their speech altogether. 
1324.2,That's what we call speech arrest. 
1326.33,Or if someone is looking at pictures 
1329.3,and they're describing the pictures 
1330.83,"and you stimulate in a particular area, "
1332.66,they stop speaking or the words start coming out slurred 
1336.29,or they can't remember the name of the object 
1339.44,that they're seeing in the picture. 
1340.76,These are all things that we're listening really carefully 
1343.61,while we apply that focal stimulation. 
1346.16,That's what we call brain mapping. 
1347.84,"- What are some of the more surprising, "
1349.94,or maybe even if you want to offer 
1351.23,one of the more outrageous examples of things 
1353.6,that people have suddenly done or failed to be able to do 
1356.99,as a consequence of this brain mapping? 
1359.33,"- Well, I think the thing to me "
1360.89,that has been the most striking 
1363.92,"is that, you know, some of these areas you stimulate, "
1366.83,"and altogether, you can shut down someone's talking. "
1370.07,"So a person says, ""I wanted to say it, "
1375.05,"but I couldn't get the words out."" "
1377.12,"And even though I've seen this thousands of times now, "
1381.71,"it's still exciting every time that I see it because, "
1389.502,"it's exciting because you're seeing the brain, "
1392.27,"it's a physical organ, it's part of the body, "
1396.17,"outside of the veins on top of it, "
1397.61,it doesn't look like a machine. 
1401.54,But when you do something like that 
1403.94,"and you focally change the way it works, "
1407.42,and you see that because the person can't talk anymore 
1409.49,"and they say, ""I know what I want to say, "
1411.38,"but I couldn't get the words out,"" "
1414.56,you're confronted with this idea 
1418.415,that that organ is the basis of speech and language 
1423.14,"and way beyond that, obviously, "
1424.91,"you know, for all the other functions "
1426.2,that we have for thinking 
1428.09,"and feeling our emotions, everything. "
1430.67,"So that, to me, is a constant reminder "
1434.27,"of, you know, this really special thing that the brain does "
1438.06,"which is compute so many of the things that we do, "
1441.497,and in particular in the area 
1442.97,"around speech and language, generating words, "
1445.88,"something that is really unique to our species, "
1450.62,is just extraordinary to see. 
1453.11,"Again, even though I've seen it thousands of times, "
1455.87,it's just having that connection 
1458.96,"because it doesn't look like a machine, "
1460.4,"but it is doing something that is quite complicated, "
1463.97,"precise, and remarkable. "
1465.62,- Do you ever see emotional responses 
1467.24,from stimulation in particular areas? 
1469.31,And do you ever hear or see emotional responses 
1474.08,that are associated with particular types of speech? 
1476.78,"Because, for instance, curse words are known to, "
1481.73,"people with Tourette's often will curse, "
1483.32,"not always, sometimes they'll have tics or other things. "
1486.29,But what I learned from a colleague of ours 
1488.63,is that curse words have a certain structure to them. 
1491.15,There's usually a heavy 
1492.83,"or kind of a sharp consonant up front, right, "
1495.89,"that allows people, at least as it was described to me, "
1499.04,to have some sort of emotional release. 
1500.45,"It's not a word like murmur, "
1502.28,"which has kind of a soft entry here, "
1504.14,"I'm not using the technical language, "
1506.0,"and you pick your favorite curse word out there, folks. "
1508.19,"I'm not going to shout out any now or say any now, "
1511.16,but that certain words have a structure to them 
1515.36,"that, because of the motor patterns "
1516.98,"that are involved in saying that word, "
1520.01,you could imagine it has an emotional response unto itself. 
1523.67,So when stimulating 
1524.81,"or when blocking these different brain areas, "
1526.34,do you ever see people get angry or sad 
1528.32,or happy or more relaxed? 
1530.9,"- Oh, well, definitely I've seen cases "
1536.06,"where you can invoke anxiety, stress, "
1541.97,and I think that there are also areas that you can stimulate 
1546.647,"and you can also evoke the opposite of that, "
1550.16,sort of like a calm state. 
1552.74,"- I think that brain area is slightly hyperactive in you, "
1555.95,or at least more than me. 
1557.83,"In all the years I've known you, "
1559.79,"you've always been, at least externally, a very calm person. "
1562.603,"I mean, I always find it amusing "
1564.29,that you work on speech and language 
1565.307,and you have a very calming voice. 
1568.79,And I'm being really serious. 
1570.11,"I think that there's a huge variation in that, right, "
1572.72,in terms of how people speak and how they accent words. 
1575.84,"- Absolutely, yeah. "
1576.86,"So there are areas, "
1578.75,"for example, the orbitofrontal cortex that we showed "
1583.82,that if you stimulate there... 
1585.14,The orbitofrontal cortex is a part of the brain 
1587.0,that's above the eyes. 
1587.87,"That's why they call it orbitofrontal, "
1590.18,meaning it's above the eye or the orbit 
1592.46,"and in the frontal lobe, and it's this area right in here. "
1596.69,It has really complex functions. 
1598.79,It's really important for learning and memory. 
1601.67,But one of the things that we observed 
1603.53,"is when you stimulate in there, "
1604.94,"people tended to have a reduction in their stress, "
1608.99,"and it was very much related to their state of being, "
1613.49,meaning that if someone was already kind of feeling normal 
1617.72,"and you stimulate there, it didn't do much. "
1619.67,"But if someone was in a very anxious state, "
1622.01,it actually relieved that. 
1623.87,And then we've seen the corollary of that 
1626.42,"which is true, too, "
1627.74,which is that there are other areas 
1629.81,like the amygdala or parts of the insula 
1632.63,"that if you stimulate, "
1634.19,"you can cause an acute temporary anxiety, "
1640.37,"a nervous feeling, "
1641.9,"or if you stimulate the insula, "
1643.55,people can have an acute feeling of disgust. 
1646.28,"So, you know, the brain has different functions "
1650.78,and these different nodes that help process the way we feel. 
1654.74,"Certainly, I think that, to some degree, "
1656.66,neuropsychiatric conditions reflect an imbalance 
1659.48,of the electrical activities in these areas. 
1664.76,One of the things that was something I will never forget 
1668.72,was taking care of a young woman with uncontrolled seizures. 
1673.88,We call that epilepsy. 
1675.05,It's a medical condition where someone 
1676.46,has uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain. 
1679.67,Sometimes you can see that as convulsions 
1681.68,where people are shaking and lose consciousness. 
1684.74,There are other kind of seizures that people can have 
1687.11,"where they don't lose consciousness, "
1688.61,but they can have experiences that just come out of nowhere 
1692.9,just as a result of electrical activity 
1695.0,coming from the brain. 
1696.77,"And about six years ago, I took care of a young woman "
1700.79,who was diagnosed psychiatrically 
1705.26,with anxiety disorder for several years. 
1707.69,It turns out that it wasn't really an anxiety disorder. 
1711.05,"It was actually that she had underlying seizures, "
1713.96,an epilepsy activating a part of her brain 
1717.11,"that evokes, you know, anxious feelings. "
1720.26,- How was that discovered? 
1721.43,Because I know a lot of people out there have anxiety. 
1723.29,"I mean, in the absence of a brain scan, "
1726.14,how or why would one suspect that maybe they have a tumor 
1730.91,or some other condition 
1733.7,that was causing those neurons to become hyperactive? 
1735.74,"- Yeah, that's really important "
1736.97,"because so many people have anxiety, "
1738.95,"and the vast, vast majority are not having that "
1741.98,because they're having seizures in the brain. 
1744.17,I think one of the ways that this was diagnosed 
1746.96,was that the nature 
1749.96,of when she was having these panic attacks 
1752.96,was not triggered by anything. 
1754.91,They would just happen spontaneously. 
1757.55,And that's what can happen with seizures sometimes. 
1759.53,They just come out of nowhere. 
1761.3,"We don't fully understand what can trigger them, "
1763.73,but they weren't things 
1764.78,that were typically anxiety-provoking. 
1768.38,This is something that just happened all of a sudden. 
1771.59,"And because you brought it up, "
1775.43,this is not something that you can see on an MRI. 
1778.64,"We could not see and look at the structure of her brain, "
1782.15,"with an MRI, that she was having seizures. "
1785.18,The only way that we could actually prove this 
1788.0,was actually putting electrodes into her brain 
1791.6,and proving that these attacks that she was having 
1796.85,"were localized to a part called the amygdala, "
1800.39,"it's a medial part of the temporal lobe, which is here, "
1803.45,and associating the electrical activity 
1806.72,that we were seeing on those electrodes 
1808.31,"with the symptoms that she had, "
1810.83,and she ultimately needed a kind of surgery 
1813.32,where she was awake in order to remove this safely. 
1819.47,"- Speaking of epilepsy, "
1821.33,a number of people out there have epilepsy 
1823.4,or know people who do. 
1825.14,Are the drugs for epilepsy satisfactory? 
1828.23,"You know, I think about things like Depakote, "
1830.09,"you know, and adjusting the excitation "
1832.04,and inhibition of the brain. 
1833.0,"I mean, are there good drugs for epilepsy? "
1835.88,We know there are not great drugs 
1837.68,for a lot of other conditions. 
1840.26,And how often does one need neurosurgery 
1844.58,in order to treat epilepsy? 
1845.66,Or can it be treated most often just using pharmacology? 
1849.53,"- Yeah, great question. "
1850.67,"Well, a lot of people have seizures "
1855.35,that can be completely controlled 
1856.64,"by their medications, a lot. "
1859.7,"But there's about a one-third of people who have epilepsy, "
1863.21,which we define as anyone who's had three or more seizures 
1869.0,"that, you know, about a third of them "
1870.98,actually don't have control 
1873.32,with all of the modern medications that we have nowadays. 
1877.16,And some of the data suggests 
1878.57,"that if you have two or three medications, "
1882.74,it actually doesn't matter necessarily 
1884.21,"which of the anti-seizure medications it is, "
1887.54,but there is data suggests 
1888.89,"if you've just tried two or three, "
1892.04,"the fourth, fifth, sixth, and beyond "
1895.76,is not likely to help control it. 
1898.01,"So we are in a situation, unfortunately, "
1901.34,"where a lot of the medications are great for some people, "
1904.61,"but for another subset, they can't control it, "
1907.46,and it comes from a particular part of the brain. 
1909.5,"Now, fortunately, in that subset, "
1913.73,there's another part of that group 
1916.01,that can benefit from a surgery 
1917.69,"that actually either removes that part of the brain, "
1920.39,"and nowadays, we'll use stimulators now "
1922.64,to sometimes put electrical stimulation 
1926.0,in that part of the brain to help reduce the seizures. 
1928.4,- And you said a third of people with epilepsy 
1930.83,might need neurosurgery? 
1932.33,"- Well, what I mean by that "
1934.01,"is, like, they continue to have seizures "
1936.38,"that are not controlled by all medications, "
1938.54,and there's going to be another subset of those 
1941.39,that may benefit from a surgery. 
1944.81,"It's probably not that whole third, it's a subset of that. "
1948.2,It's just to say that epilepsy 
1949.79,can be really hard to get fixed. 
1951.71,And for people where the seizures come from one spot 
1956.15,"or, you know, an area, then surgery can do great. "
1960.46,If it comes from multiple areas 
1962.33,"or if it comes from the whole brain, "
1963.53,then we have to think about other methods to control it. 
1966.2,"Fortunately, nowadays, there's actually other ways. "
1969.41,"Surgery now, to us, "
1970.52,doesn't just mean removing part of the brain. 
1974.66,Half of what we do now is use stimulators 
1977.18,that modulate the state of the brain 
1978.5,that can help reduce the seizures. 
1981.17,- I've heard before that the ketogenic diet 
1984.74,was originally formulated in order to treat epilepsy 
1989.51,"and, in particular, in kids. "
1991.43,"Is that true, and why would being in a ketogenic state "
1995.6,with low blood glucose reduce seizures? 
1998.69,- That's a great question. 
1999.95,"And to be honest, I don't know actually "
2002.53,"if it was originally designed to treat seizures, "
2005.68,"but I can tell you for sure that for some people, "
2009.04,"just like with some medications, "
2010.81,it can be a life-changing thing. 
2012.58,It can completely change the way that the brain works. 
2016.54,"And it's not something that's for everybody, "
2019.66,"but for some people, there's no question, "
2021.4,and it has some very beneficial effects. 
2023.71,"I think it's to be determined still, "
2025.57,like why and how that works. 
2028.84,- I've heard similar things about the ketogenic diet 
2030.85,"for people with Alzheimer's dementia, "
2033.25,that there's nothing particularly relevant 
2037.63,"about ketosis to Alzheimer's per se, "
2039.88,but because Alzheimer's changes the way 
2043.0,that neurons metabolize energy 
2046.06,that shifting to an alternate fuel source 
2047.98,"can sometimes make people feel better, "
2049.717,and so a number of people are now trying it. 
2051.37,But it's not as if blood glucose and having carbohydrates 
2056.23,is causing Alzheimer's. 
2057.64,And people get confused often 
2058.96,that just because something can help 
2061.63,doesn't mean that the opposite is harming somebody. 
2064.75,So I find this really interesting. 
2066.61,Sometime I'll check back with you about what's happening 
2068.5,in terms of ketogenic diets and epilepsy. 
2071.32,"But you said that in some cases, it can help. "
2074.89,Has that observation been made 
2076.18,both for children and for adults? 
2078.1,"Because I thought that, originally, "
2079.36,the ketogenic diet for epilepsy 
2081.58,was really for pediatric epilepsy. 
2084.04,"- Yeah, that's right. "
2084.88,"So a lot of its focus has really been on kids with epilepsy, "
2089.47,"but certainly it's a safe thing to try, "
2092.23,"so a lot of adults, you know, will try it as well. "
2094.9,- Interesting. 
2095.83,I'd like to take a quick break 
2097.21,"and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens. "
2100.24,"Athletic Greens, now called AG"
"1,",
2102.73,is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink 
2105.1,that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs. 
2107.98,I've been taking Athletic Greens since 
"2012,",
2110.68,so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
2112.9,"The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, "
2114.49,and the reason I still take Athletic Greens 
2116.56,"once or usually twice a day, "
2118.54,is that it gets me the probiotics 
2120.46,that I need for gut health. 
2122.14,Our gut is very important. 
2123.25,It's populated by gut microbiota 
2125.8,"that communicate with the brain, the immune system, "
2127.57,and basically all the biological systems of our body 
2129.94,"to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health, "
2133.6,and those probiotics in Athletic Greens 
2135.46,are optimal and vital for microbiotic health. 
2139.27,"In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number "
2141.13,"of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure "
2143.26,"that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met, "
2146.2,and it tastes great. 
2148.09,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
2149.56,"you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, "
2152.95,and they'll give you five free travel packs 
2154.9,that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
2157.21,"while you're on the road, in the car, "
2158.5,"on the plane, et cetera. "
2159.82,And they'll give you a year's supply of Vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
2163.21,"Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman "
2165.91,to get the five free travel packs 
2167.26,and the year's supply of Vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
2170.35,I'm curious about epilepsy for another reason. 
2174.25,I was taught that epilepsy is an imbalance 
2176.47,in the excitation and inhibition in the brain. 
2178.968,So you think about these electrical storms 
2180.4,"that give people either grand mal, "
2182.14,"you know, shaking and kind of convulsions. "
2185.71,"But years ago, I was reading a book, "
2187.78,"a wonderful book actually, "
2189.19,"called ""Einstein in Love"" by Dennis Overbye. "
2191.53,It was about Einstein and I guess his personal life. 
2196.69,People who knew him 
2198.07,"claimed that he would sometimes walk along, "
2200.65,and then every once in a while would just stop 
2202.87,and kind of stare off into space 
2204.19,"for anywhere from a minute to three to five minutes, "
2207.4,and it was speculated that he had absence seizures. 
2211.75,What is an absence seizure? 
2213.34,And the reason I ask is I occasionally will be walking along 
2216.73,and I'll be thinking about something and I'll stop. 
2218.68,"But in my mind, I'm thinking during that time, "
2223.3,"but I realize that if I were to see myself from the outside, "
2225.43,it might appear that I was just kind of absent. 
2227.98,What is an absence seizure? 
2230.02,Because it's so strikingly different in its description 
2232.75,"from, say, a grand mal convulsive seizure. "
2235.66,"- Sure, well, like I mentioned before, "
2239.8,depending on how the seizure activity spreads in the brain 
2243.07,"or how it actually propagates, "
2246.28,if it stays in one particular spot 
2247.99,"and doesn't spread to the entire brain, "
2249.67,it can have really different manifestation. 
2252.67,It can represent really differently. 
2254.56,So absence seizure is just one category 
2257.53,of different kind of seizures 
2258.7,"where you can lose consciousness basically, "
2262.18,and what I mean by that is that you're not fully aware 
2265.96,"of what's going on in your environment, okay? "
2268.15,So you're sort of taken offline 
2269.71,"temporarily from consciousness, "
2272.2,"but you could still be, for example, standing, "
2275.47,"and to people who are not paying attention, "
2278.05,they may not even be aware that that's happening. 
2281.53,- What are some other types of seizures? 
2283.48,"- Well, you know, I think some of the other kinds, "
2287.83,the classic ones are temporal lobe seizures. 
2289.99,So these are ones that come from the medial structures 
2293.41,like the amygdala and hippocampus. 
2295.72,"Oftentimes people, when they have seizures coming from that, "
2298.78,they may taste something very unusual like a metallic taste 
2304.0,"or smell something like the smell of burning toast, "
2307.42,something like that. 
2309.79,"There are some people, with temporal lobe seizures, "
2312.22,will have deja vu. 
2313.36,They will have that experience 
2314.65,"that you've been somewhere before, "
2316.72,but that's just a precursor to the seizure. 
2319.87,And it just highlights that when people have seizures 
2323.17,"coming from these areas, "
2324.7,they sometimes hijack what that part of the brain 
2328.69,is really for. 
2329.53,"So the amygdala and hippocampus, for example, "
2332.74,are really important for learning and memory. 
2335.17,It's not surprising that when people have seizures there 
2337.63,that it can evoke a feeling of deja vu 
2340.78,or that it can evoke a feeling of anxiety. 
2345.31,"And the areas that are right next to it, for example, "
2350.92,these areas are really important for processing smell. 
2354.79,So these areas are right next to each other 
2357.4,"so you can have these kind of complex set of symptoms, "
2360.13,"the weird taste, the smell of toast, "
2363.97,"and then a feeling of deja vu, "
2365.29,"that's classic for a temporal lobe seizure, "
2368.14,and it's because those parts of the brain 
2369.463,that process those functions are right next to each other. 
2373.75,"- I'm told that I've had nocturnal seizures, "
2377.05,and I've woken up sometimes from sleep 
2378.94,"having felt as if I was having a convulsion, "
2381.19,the sort of sense of buzzing in the back of the head. 
2384.25,This happened to me two or three times in college. 
2388.0,"Well, I woke up and my girlfriend was very distraught, "
2390.61,"like, ""You were having a seizure."" "
2391.72,I was having full convulsion in my sleep. 
2395.23,Is that correct? 
2397.06,Is there such a thing as nocturnal seizures? 
2398.98,What do they reflect? 
2400.39,"They eventually stopped happening, "
2402.46,and I couldn't tether them to any kind of life event. 
2404.95,I wasn't doing any kind of combat sport 
2407.47,"or anything at the time, "
2408.43,"I wasn't drinking alcohol much, "
2411.25,it's never really been my thing. 
2414.22,What are nocturnal seizures about? 
2416.05,"- [Eddie] Oh, well- "
2417.73,- And do I need brain surgery? 
2418.822,[Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] 
2420.58,- Nocturnal seizures are just another form. 
2423.64,"Like, again, epilepsy and seizures "
2425.71,can have so many different forms 
2427.21,"and not just, like, where in the brain, "
2430.15,but also when they happen. 
2431.77,"And there are some people who, for whatever reason, "
2435.64,it's very timed to the circadian rhythm. 
2438.49,"It's actually not just happening at night, "
2440.14,but a certain period at night 
2441.49,when people are in a certain stage of sleep 
2444.4,that the brain is in a state 
2445.84,"that it's vulnerable to having a seizure, "
2449.83,and so that's basically just one form of that. 
2453.01,"Again, it's not just about where it's coming from, "
2455.08,but also when it's happening and how that's timed 
2457.6,with other things that are happening with the body. 
2460.36,- Interesting. 
2461.193,"Well, it eventually stopped happening "
2462.43,so I stopped worrying about it. 
2465.25,I haven't had seizures since. 
2468.16,"Returning to speech and language, "
2470.41,"when I was getting weaned in neuroscience, "
2473.77,I learned that we have an area of the brain 
2475.36,for producing speech 
2476.56,and we have an area of the brain for comprehending speech. 
2480.91,What's the story there? 
2482.08,Is it still true 
2483.28,that we have a Broca's and a Wernicke's area? 
2486.19,"Those are names of neurologists, presumably, "
2488.38,or neurosurgeons that discovered 
2489.58,these different brain areas. 
2491.23,Maybe you could familiarize us 
2492.49,with some of the sort of textbook version 
2495.97,"of how speech and language are organized in the brain, "
2499.06,maybe share with us a little bit of the lesion studies 
2500.98,"that led to that understanding, "
2502.33,and then I would love to hear a bit 
2504.49,about what your laboratory is discovering 
2506.23,"about how things are actually organized, "
2508.66,because from some discussions you and I have had 
2511.78,"over the last year or so, "
2512.89,"it seems like, well, let's just be blunt, "
2515.05,it seems that much of what we know from the textbooks 
2517.57,could be wrong. 
2519.64,"- Well, I love that question "
2522.91,"because, for me, it's very central to the research we do, "
2527.05,and it's where the intersection 
2528.19,between what we do in the laboratory in our research 
2531.94,interfaces with what I see in patients. 
2536.08,And one of the things that fascinated me 
2538.57,early on in my medical training 
2540.43,was in doing some of these brain mapping 
2543.4,or watching them with my mentor 
2545.02,"or taking care of patients that had, you know, brain tumors "
2548.89,in a certain part of the brain 
2550.78,"was that, a lot of times, what I was seeing in a patient "
2553.3,did not correlate with what I was taught in medical school. 
2557.38,"And, you know, some people will think, "
2560.26,"well, this might be an exception, "
2563.08,but after you see it for a couple times 
2564.787,"and if you're kind of interested in this problem, "
2569.38,"you know, it poses a serious challenge "
2571.6,to what you've learned 
2573.58,and how you think about how these things operate. 
2577.06,And that actually got me really interested 
2579.79,in trying to figure this out 
2581.65,"because, earlier, we talked about "
2584.05,just this extraordinary thing that the brain is doing 
2587.08,"to create words and sentences, "
2589.78,and that's the process by which I'm getting ideas out 
2593.23,from my mind into yours. 
2595.9,"It's an incredible thing, right? "
2596.95,"It's the basis of communication, "
2601.18,high information communication between two individuals 
2605.02,that's really unique to humans. 
2607.21,"So in historical times, "
2613.3,how this works has been very controversial 
2616.09,from day one of neuroscience. 
2621.816,"A long time ago, people thought the bumps on your head "
2625.06,corresponded to the different faculties of the mind. 
2629.41,"So for example, if you had a bump here, "
2631.36,it might be corresponding to intelligence 
2634.09,"or another one over here, you know, to vision "
2636.73,and these kind of things. 
2638.86,"That's what we nowadays call phrenology, "
2641.14,and that was kind of the starting point. 
2645.13,"A lot of that has been, of course, debunked, "
2647.26,but when you see those little statues 
2648.91,"of different brain partitions on someone's head, "
2652.63,that's essentially how people 
2655.36,"were thinking about how the brain worked back then, "
2658.45,a couple hundred years ago. 
2661.54,"Modern neuroscience began when, "
2665.35,"actually, it was very much related "
2667.03,to the discovery of language. 
2668.8,"So modern neuroscience, "
2670.39,meaning moving beyond this idea that the bumps on the scalp 
2674.02,"corresponded to the faculties of the mind, "
2676.18,but there were things 
2677.013,"that actually were in the brain themselves, "
2678.91,and they weren't corresponding to things 
2680.62,"that you could see superficially, "
2682.69,"like on the scalp or externally, "
2686.29,that it was something about the brain itself. 
2688.39,"I mean, it seems so obvious now, "
2690.19,"but back then, this was the big academic, you know, debate. "
2695.2,And the first observation 
2698.26,that I think was really impactful in the area of language 
2702.07,was an observation by a French neurosurgeon 
2705.94,named Pierre Broca. 
2707.89,"And what he observed was that in a patient, "
2711.04,"not that he did surgery in, "
2712.18,"but that he had seen and taken care of, "
2715.512,that the person couldn't talk. 
2717.82,"And, in particular, they called this individual Tan "
2721.24,"because the only words that he could produce was tan, tan. "
2726.43,"For the most part, "
2727.263,he could generally understand the kind of things 
2729.4,"that people were asking him about, "
2732.04,but the only thing that he could utter from his mouth 
2735.43,"were these words, tan, tan. "
2738.76,And what eventually had happened 
2741.43,"was this individual passed away, "
2744.49,and the way that neuroscience was done back then 
2747.16,was basically to wait until that happened 
2749.89,and then to remove the brain 
2751.18,and to see what part of the brain was affected 
2754.3,in this patient that they called Tan. 
2756.58,And what Broca found was that there was a part 
2760.48,"in the left frontal lobe, "
2763.51,"so the frontal lobe is this area like I described earlier, "
2765.82,"which is, you know, up behind our forehead, up here, "
2769.96,"and in the back of that frontal lobe, "
2775.81,he claimed that this was the seat of articulation 
2781.06,in the brain. 
2781.893,"He literally used something like that in French, "
2783.64,"the seat of articulation, "
2785.41,meaning that this is the part of the brain 
2787.15,that is responsible for us to generate words. 
2791.83,About 
50,"years later, the story becomes more complicated "
2797.05,with a German neurologist named Carl Wernicke. 
2801.07,And what Wernicke described 
2803.17,was a different set of symptoms 
2806.62,in patients that he observed a different phenomenon 
2810.91,"where people could produce words, "
2815.83,"but a lot of the words, "
2816.993,and they were fluent in the sense 
2819.25,"that, like, they sound like they could be real words "
2824.56,"but from a different language, for example. "
2827.47,"And some of us call that, like, word salad or jargon. "
2831.661,"They were essentially making up words, "
2834.16,but it was not intentional. 
2835.21,It was just the way that the words came out. 
2837.67,"But in addition to that, he observed that these people "
2841.0,also could not understand what was being said to them. 
2844.93,"So we could be having a conversation, "
2847.87,"and I'd be asking you, ""Am I a woman?"" "
2850.84,"And you might nod your head, "
2852.19,"you know, just because you're not processing the question. "
2856.57,And so here are two observations. 
2863.02,One is that the frontal lobe is important 
2865.66,"for articulating speech, "
2867.91,creating the words and expressing them fluently. 
2871.15,And then a different part of the brain 
2872.71,"called the left temporal lobe, "
2875.11,"which is this area right above my ear, "
2879.91,that is an area that I think was claimed 
2883.3,to be really important for understanding. 
2885.97,"So the two major functions in language, "
2889.0,"to speak and to understand, "
2891.88,"were kind of pinned down to that, "
2893.29,and we've had that basic idea in the textbooks 
2898.57,"for, you know, over "
200,years. 
2900.58,- It's certainly what I was taught. 
2901.99,- [Eddie] Is that right? 
2902.823,"- Oh, yeah, and certainly what we still, "
2904.99,"we still teach undergraduates, graduate students, "
2907.45,and medical students that. 
2909.22,"- Well, that's what I learned, too, in medical school. "
2911.53,And what I saw in reality 
2913.81,when I started taking care of patients 
2915.25,was that it's not so simple. 
2918.79,"In fact, part of it is fundamentally wrong. "
2920.86,"So just in a nutshell, "
2922.66,"nowadays, after, you know, looking at this very carefully "
2926.23,"over hundreds of patients, "
2927.49,"we've shown that surgeries, "
2929.8,"for example, in the posterior part of the frontal lobe, "
2933.85,"a lot of times, people have no problem talking at all "
2936.73,"whatsoever after those kind of surgeries, "
2939.91,and that it's a different part of the brain 
2941.86,that we call the precentral gyrus. 
2945.31,The precentral gyrus is a part of the brain 
2947.95,that is intimately associated with the motor cortex. 
2952.09,The motor cortex is the part of the brain 
2953.233,that has a map of your entire body 
2956.74,"so that it has a part that corresponds to your feet, "
2959.38,it has a part that corresponds to your hands. 
2961.54,But then there's another part 
2962.8,that comes out more laterally on the side of the brain 
2965.44,"that corresponds to your lips, your jaw, your larynx, "
2969.55,and we have seen that when patients have surgeries 
2973.63,"or injuries to that part of the brain, "
2975.61,"it actually can really interrupt language, "
2977.5,so it's not as simple 
2978.37,"as just moving the muscles of the vocal tract, "
2981.37,but it's also important for formulating 
2983.62,and expressing words. 
2985.42,So that's Broca's area 
2989.05,that I think the field now recognizes 
2992.26,"not just because of our work, "
2993.31,but many other people that have studied this 
2995.29,"in stroke and beyond, "
2996.91,is that the idea 
2998.5,that that is the basis of speaking in Broca's area 
3002.49,"is fundamentally wrong right now, "
3005.547,and we have to figure out how to correct the textbooks 
3008.1,that we kind of understand that 
3009.223,so that we can continue to make progress. 
3013.29,"Now, in terms of the other major area "
3015.78,"that we call Wernicke's area in the posterior temporal lobe, "
3020.28,"that has held, "
3024.99,"I think, quite legitimately for some time. "
3027.75,So that is an area that you have to be super careful 
3032.28,when you do surgery there. 
3034.23,"That's an area where, "
3036.21,if you have a mistake there and you cause a stroke 
3040.17,"or you remove too much of the tumor there, "
3042.84,"you go too far beyond it, "
3045.3,"then the person can be really, really hurt. "
3048.66,"Like, they'll have a condition that we call aphasia "
3051.6,"where they may not be able to understand words, "
3054.0,they may not be able to remember the word 
3058.007,that they're trying to say. 
3059.16,"They know what they're trying to say, "
3060.66,but they can't remember the precise word 
3063.12,that goes with the object that they're trying to think of. 
3065.58,They may even produce words 
3067.95,that I described before are like word salad or very jargony. 
3072.06,"So, you know, they might say something like tamiranai. "
3077.49,"That's not a real word, "
3078.93,"but it sounds like it could be, you know? "
3081.42,And that's just because that part of the brain 
3083.25,"has some role not just in understanding what we hear, "
3087.51,but also actually has a really important role 
3090.15,in sending the commands to different parts of the brain 
3092.37,to control what we say. 
3094.77,"- Not long ago, you and me "
3098.61,and my good friend Rick Rubin 
3101.01,"were having a conversation about medicine and science, "
3105.03,"and Rick asked the question, "
3107.587,"""What percentage of what you learned "
3110.82,"in graduate and/or medical school do you think is correct?"" "
3117.03,And you had a very interesting answer. 
3119.94,Would you share it with us? 
3122.76,- I don't know. I don't remember the exact. 
3124.53,But I would say 
3125.94,"that with regard to the brain in particular, "
3131.97,I would say about 
50%,
3133.95,"gets it right and accurate and is helpful, "
3138.03,but another 
50%,is just the approximation 
3141.24,and oversimplification of what's going on. 
3144.36,"The example that we talked about, "
3145.47,language is just an example of that. 
3147.06,It's just there are things that make it easier to learn 
3151.77,"and easier to teach and easier to even think about, "
3155.73,and that's probably why we continue teaching 
3157.83,in the way that we do. 
3159.33,"But I think as time goes on, "
3161.43,the complexity of reality of how the brain works 
3164.91,"is, well, first of all, "
3167.61,"we're still trying to figure it out, "
3169.62,"and second of all, it is complex "
3171.42,and it's still incomplete story. 
3174.21,- It's early days. 
3175.043,And we'll get into some of the technical advances 
3177.6,that are allowing some correction of the errors 
3181.17,that the field has made. 
3182.82,"And, look, no disrespect to the brain explorers "
3185.91,"that came before us, "
3187.02,"and the ones that come after us will correct us, right? "
3190.59,That's the way the game is played. 
3192.6,But what I'm hearing 
3193.8,"is that there are certain truths that people accept, "
3196.08,and then there's about half of the information 
3198.45,that is still open for debate 
3199.98,and maybe even for complete revision. 
3202.8,One thing that I learned about language 
3205.41,and the neural circuits underlying language 
3207.72,"is that it's heavily lateralized, "
3209.61,"that these structures, Broca's and Wernicke's "
3211.74,and other structures in the brain 
3212.85,responsible for speech and comprehension of speech 
3215.94,"sit mainly on one side of the brain, "
3218.67,but they do not have a mirror representation 
3222.06,or another equivalent area 
3224.01,on the opposite side of the brain. 
3225.12,"And for those that haven't poked around in a lot of brains, "
3230.13,"certainly you, Eddie, "
3231.9,"have done far more of that than I have, "
3233.31,but I've done my fair share in nonhuman species 
3236.19,"and a little bit in humans, "
3238.11,"almost every structure, "
3239.31,almost every structure has a matching structure 
3242.91,"on the other side of the brain, "
3243.96,"so when we say the hippocampus, "
3245.31,"we really mean two hippocampi, "
3247.23,one on each side of the brain. 
3248.79,"But language, I was taught, is heavily lateralized, "
3251.64,"that is, that there's only one. "
3253.5,"So that raises two questions. One, is that true? "
3256.14,"And if it is true, then what is the equivalent real estate "
3260.52,on the opposite side of the brain doing 
3262.62,if it's not doing the same function 
3264.03,"that the one on, say, the left side is performing? "
3266.43,"- Well, that's one of those things "
3267.66,"that is, again, like mostly true, not "
100%.,
3271.35,And what I mean by that is that it's complicated. 
3275.19,"So for people who are right-handed, "
3278.52,
99%,"of the time, the language part of the brain "
3281.16,is on the left side. 
3283.74,- And what is the equivalent brain area 
3285.87,on the right side doing if it's not doing language? 
3288.93,"- Well, you know, the thing that's incredible "
3290.4,is if you look at the right side 
3292.59,"and you look at it very carefully, "
3293.67,either under an MRI 
3295.74,or you actually look at the brain 
3297.27,"under slides in a microscope, "
3299.31,"it looks very, very similar. "
3300.9,"It's not identical, but it looks very, very similar. "
3303.93,"All the gyri, which are the bumps on the brain "
3306.93,"that, you know, have the different contours "
3308.94,"and the valleys that we call sulci, "
3310.77,those all look basically the same. 
3312.54,"Like, there is a mirror anatomy on the left and right side, "
3317.25,and so it's not been so clear 
3319.38,what's so special actually about the left side 
3324.055,to house language. 
3325.17,"But what we do know, "
3326.337,and this is what we use all the time in assessing 
3329.46,"and figuring out, you know, this before surgery, "
3332.46,"is if you're right-handed, "
3334.2,
99%,"of the time, the language is going to be "
3337.02,on the left side of the brain. 
3338.7,- Is handedness genetic in any way? 
3340.71,"I mean, when I grew up, - Yes. "
3342.03,- a pen or a pencil or crayon 
3343.65,"was placed into my hand presumably, or I started using... "
3346.77,"My father was left-handed, "
3348.24,"and then where he grew up in South America, "
3350.61,they forced him to force himself to become right-handed. 
3354.75,They actually used to restrict the movement of his left hand 
3357.24,so he was forced to write... 
3359.4,And then you have hook lefties and hook righties. 
3362.55,And I know this is a deep dive 
3364.77,and we probably don't want to go 
3365.7,"into every derivation of this, "
3367.53,"but so for somebody who's left-handed, "
3370.29,"naturally just starts writing with the left hand, "
3372.57,there's some genetic predisposition to being left-handed? 
3376.41,- Absolutely. No question about it. 
3378.63,Handedness is not entirely but strongly genetic. 
3383.73,"So there is something that ties all of this, "
3387.48,"and what does handedness, for example, have to do "
3389.37,with the part of your brain that controls language? 
3392.76,"Well, it turns out that the parts that control the hand "
3395.79,are very close to the areas 
3397.17,that really are responsible for the vocal tract. 
3399.99,"Again, part of the motor cortex "
3401.85,and part of this brain area called the precentral gyrus. 
3405.0,And there are some theories 
3406.68,"that, because of their proximity, "
3409.47,that these parts of the brain 
3410.4,might develop together early in utero 
3413.46,"and they might have a head start compared to the right side, "
3416.13,and because they have a head start 
3417.87,that things solidify there. 
3419.91,This is one theory of why this happens. 
3422.94,"In people who are left-handed, "
3425.12,it still turns out that the vast majority of people 
3427.98,"have language on the left side, "
3429.63,but it's not 
"99%,",it's more like 
70%.,
3433.41,"So if you're left-handed, "
3435.42,it's still more likely that the language part of your brain 
3438.75,"is going to be on the left side, "
3440.91,"but there's going to be a greater proportion, maybe "
"20,",
"30%,",
3444.6,where it's either in both hemispheres or on the right side. 
3450.78,And just to make this a little bit more interesting 
3454.11,"is that when people have strokes on the left side, "
3458.97,"and if they are lucky enough to recover from those strokes, "
3462.39,"sometimes that involves reorganization, "
3464.49,"this term that we call plasticity earlier, "
3467.01,where the areas around where the stroke 
3469.83,take on that new function 
3470.91,in a way that they didn't have before. 
3473.04,"That can certainly happen in the left hemisphere, "
3476.52,but there are also instances where the right hemisphere 
3480.99,can also start to take on the function of language 
3483.73,where it was once on left and then transfers to the right. 
3488.79,So the thing that I think about a lot 
3492.21,is that the machinery 
3495.87,"probably exists on both sides, "
3498.96,but we don't use them together all the time. 
3502.5,"In fact, we may strongly bias one side or the other. "
3506.34,"Just like we use our two hands in very, very different ways, "
3509.88,it's a little bit the same with the brain. 
3511.8,"Well, it's because of what we do with the brain "
3513.63,that actually is why we use the hands in different ways. 
3516.51,"And the same thing goes for language, "
3518.25,"which is that, again, the substrates, the organ, "
3521.25,"the language organ, the part of the brain that process it "
3524.7,probably has very similar machinery 
3527.73,"on the left side as the right, "
3530.217,"and the right may have the capability to do it, "
3533.25,"but in real, everyday use, "
3535.68,the brain specializes one of the sides 
3539.19,in order for us to use it functionally. 
3543.36,That's a theory. 
3544.77,"- You're bilingual, correct? "
3546.12,- Yeah. 
3546.953,- [Andrew] You speak English and Chinese? 
3548.22,- Yeah. 
3549.75,"- For people that are bilingual and that learn two or more, "
3553.29,"well, bilingual is two, obviously, "
3554.4,but learn both languages 
3556.56,"or let's say more languages from an early time in life, "
3560.94,do they use the same brain area to generate that language? 
3563.82,Or perhaps they use the left side to speak English 
3567.75,and the right side to speak Chinese? 
3569.34,Do we know anything about bilingualism in the brain? 
3572.997,"- Well, I think we know a lot "
3573.84,about bilingualism in the brain. 
3575.67,"The answers are still out there, the final answers on it, "
3578.88,"and part of the answer is yes, absolutely, "
3582.18,we use some parts of the brain very similarly. 
3586.98,We actually have a study in the lab right now 
3588.63,where we're looking at this 
3589.65,where people who speak one language or another 
3593.34,"or are bilingual, "
3595.23,and we're looking at how the brain activity patterns occur 
3599.34,when they're hearing one language versus the other. 
3601.11,"And what's striking to see, actually, "
3603.6,is how overlapping they really can be. 
3606.57,Even though the person may have no idea 
3609.72,"of the language that they're hearing, "
3612.24,the English part of the brain is still processing that 
3615.21,and maybe trying to interpret it 
3616.95,"through an English lens, for example. "
3620.04,"So the short answer is that with bilingualism, "
3623.37,"there are shared circuitry, "
3625.928,there's this shared machinery in the brain 
3628.71,"that allows us to process both, but it's not identical. "
3634.32,"It's the same part of the brain, "
3635.88,but what it's doing with the signals 
3638.22,"can be very, very different. "
3640.32,And what I mean by that precisely 
3641.94,"is not the instantaneous detecting of one sound to the next, "
3646.44,but the memory of the sequences of those particular sounds 
3651.6,"that give rise to things like words and meaning, "
3654.36,"that can be highly variable from one individual to the next, "
3658.38,"and those neurons are very, very sensitive "
3661.38,"to the sequences of the sounds, "
3663.39,even though the sounds themselves 
3665.58,might have some overlap between languages. 
3667.92,- Fascinating. 
3669.18,"Okay, so we've talked about brain areas "
3671.19,and a little bit about lateralization. 
3673.83,I want to get back to the hands 
3675.09,and some things related to emotion in a little bit. 
3677.04,But maybe now we could go into those brain areas 
3680.79,"and start to ask the question, "
3684.09,what exactly is represented or mapped there? 
3687.39,And for people who perhaps aren't familiar 
3689.91,"with brain mapping and representation and receptive fields, "
3693.12,perhaps the simplest analogy might be the visual system 
3698.04,"where I look at your face, I know you, I recognize you, "
3700.56,and certainly there are brain areas 
3701.79,that are responsible for face recognition. 
3705.39,"But the fact that I know that that's your face, "
3708.99,"and for those listening, I'm looking into Eddie's face, "
3711.57,the fact that I know that that's your face at all 
3713.22,is because we are well aware that there are cells 
3716.61,"that represent edges and that represent dark and light, "
3719.55,and those all combine 
3720.57,in what we call a hierarchical structure. 
3722.37,They sort of build up from basic elements 
3725.25,"as simple as little dots, "
3726.51,"but then lines and things that move, et cetera, "
3728.4,to give a coherent representation of the face. 
3732.54,"When I think about language, "
3733.71,I think about words and just talking. 
3735.63,If I sit down and do a long podcast 
3737.19,"or I think about asking you a question, "
3738.51,I don't even think about the words I want to say very much. 
3741.93,"I mean, I have to think about them a little bit, "
3743.31,"one would hope, "
3744.39,but I don't think about individual syllables 
3746.61,"unless I'm trying to, you know, accent something "
3750.18,or it's a word that I have a particular difficulty saying 
3754.29,"or I want to change the cadence, et cetera. "
3756.87,"So what's represented in the neurons, "
3759.21,the nerve cells in these areas? 
3760.41,"Are they representing vowels, consonants? "
3763.02,And how do things like inflection... 
3764.52,"Like I occasionally will poke fun at upspeak, "
3767.79,"but there's, I think, a healthy, a normal version of upspeak "
3772.95,"where somebody's asking a question, "
3774.24,"like, for instance, what is that? "
3776.52,That's an appropriate use of upspeak 
3778.71,as opposed to saying something that is not a question 
3781.89,"and putting a lilt at the end of the sentence, "
3783.75,"then we call that upspeak, "
3785.19,which doesn't fit with what the person is saying. 
3788.91,"So what in the world is contained in these brain areas, "
3791.94,"what is represented, "
3793.98,"to me, is perhaps one of the most interesting questions, "
3797.13,and I know this lands square in your wheelhouse. 
3799.44,"- Sure, let's get into this, Andrew, "
3802.44,because this is one of the most exciting stuff 
3805.32,that's happening right now is understanding 
3807.21,how the brain processes these exact questions. 
3810.78,"And you asked me earlier, "
3811.63,"you know, what is difference between speech and language? "
3814.95,Speech corresponds to the communication signal. 
3819.81,It corresponds to me moving my mouth and my vocal tract 
3823.14,"to generate words, "
3824.85,and you're hearing these as an auditory signal. 
3828.45,Language is something much broader. 
3832.29,So it refers to what you're extracting 
3835.35,"from the words that I'm saying, "
3836.73,we call that pragmatics 
3837.9,and sort of are you getting the gist of what I'm saying? 
3840.51,There's another aspect of it that we call semantics. 
3842.82,Do you understand the meaning 
3844.83,of these words and the sentences? 
3848.25,"There's another part that we call syntax, "
3849.9,which refers to how the words are assembled 
3852.48,in a grammatical form. 
3854.07,"So those are all really critical parts of language, "
3857.13,and speech is just one form of language. 
3860.31,"There's many other forms like sign language, reading. "
3864.12,Those are all important modalities for reading. 
3867.09,Our research really focuses on this area 
3871.62,"that we're calling speech, "
3872.64,"again, the production of this audio signal "
3876.99,which you can't see but your microphones are picking up. 
3881.19,There are these vibrations in the air 
3883.89,that are created by my vocal tract 
3885.78,that are picked up by the microphone 
3888.54,"in the case of this recording, "
3889.8,but also picked up by the sensors in your ear. 
3893.07,The very tiny vibrations in your ear are picking that up 
3896.91,and translating that into electrical activity. 
3900.93,And what the ear does at the periphery 
3904.2,is translates all sounds into different frequencies. 
3909.39,So its main thing to do is to take a speech signal 
3914.52,"or any other kind of sound and decompose it, "
3917.67,meaning separate that sound into different kind of signals. 
3923.31,"And in the case of hearing, what it's doing "
3925.47,"is separating it out into low, middle, high frequencies "
3930.72,"at a very, very high resolution. "
3933.63,"It's doing it very quickly, "
3935.1,and it's doing it in a really fine way 
3936.36,to separate all of those different sounds. 
3938.73,So if you look at the periphery 
3940.68,"near the nerve that goes to your ear, "
3943.65,"those nerve fibers, "
3944.67,"some of them are tuned to low frequencies, "
3947.49,"some of them are tuned to high frequencies, "
3949.47,"some of them are tuned to the middle frequencies, "
3951.75,and that is what your ear is doing. 
3953.73,It's taking these words 
3954.84,and splitting them up into different frequencies. 
3958.08,- And for those of you out there 
3959.16,that aren't familiar with thinking about things 
3960.54,"in the so-called frequency space, "
3963.42,bass tones would be lower frequencies 
3965.34,"and high-pitched tones would be higher frequencies, "
3967.59,just to make sure everyone's on the same page. 
3969.81,"So the sound of my voice, the sound of your voice, "
3972.48,or any sound in the environment 
3973.47,is being broken down into these frequencies. 
3975.66,Are they being broken down 
3977.04,"into very narrow channels of frequency, "
3980.04,"or are they, I want to avoid nomenclature here, "
3983.52,or are they being binned as fairly broad frequencies? 
3987.24,"'Cause we know low, medium, and high, "
3989.31,"but, for instance, I can detect "
3991.86,whether or not something's approaching me 
3993.69,or moving away from me 
3995.07,depending on whether or not it sweeps louder 
3998.197,[imitates sound approaching] 
3999.27,"or [imitates sound receding], right, towards or away. "
4002.12,"It's subtle, and of course it's combined "
4003.98,"with what I see and my own movement, "
4006.05,But how finely sliced 
4010.34,is our perception of the auditory world? 
4013.16,"- Oh, extraordinarily precise. "
4015.83,"I mean, we take these millisecond cues, "
4020.09,the millisecond differences 
4021.53,"between the sound coming to one ear, "
4023.78,"let's say your right ear versus your left, "
4026.54,to understand what direction that sound came from. 
4030.11,"Those are only millisecond differences, "
4032.57,and that's how precise this works. 
4035.06,"But on the other hand, "
4036.71,it does a lot of computation on this 
4038.9,"it does a lot of analysis as you go up, "
4041.507,and a lot of our work is focused on the part of the brain 
4045.77,that we call the cortex. 
4046.85,The cortex is the outermost part of brain where we believe 
4052.22,that sounds are actually converted into words and language. 
4056.6,So there's this transformation 
4058.25,"where, at the ear, words are decomposed "
4062.12,"and turned into these elemental frequency channels, "
4066.77,"and then as it goes up through the auditory system, "
4070.49,hits the cortex. 
4072.32,There are some things that happen obviously 
4073.76,"before it gets to the cortex, "
4075.53,"but when it gets to cortex, "
4076.94,"there's something special going on, "
4079.28,which is that that part of the brain 
4080.9,is looking for specific sounds. 
4084.32,And specifically what I mean by that 
4086.21,"is the sounds of human language, "
4089.33,so the ones that are the different consonants and vowels 
4092.273,in a different language. 
4094.01,One of the ways that we have studied this 
4096.62,is looking in patients who have epilepsy. 
4101.0,And in a lot of these cases 
4102.41,"where the MRI looks completely normal, "
4105.47,we have to put electrodes surgically on a part of the brain. 
4110.72,"The temporal lobe is a very, very common place, "
4112.46,so we've done a lot of our work 
4113.6,looking at how the temporal lobe processes speech sounds 
4117.83,"because we're looking for where the seizures start, "
4122.27,but then we're also doing brain mapping 
4124.43,for language and speech so we can protect those areas. 
4127.07,We want to identify the areas that we want to remove 
4129.08,"to cure someone's seizures, "
4130.52,but we also want to figure out the areas 
4132.17,that are important for speech and language 
4133.91,to protect those so that we can do a surgery 
4136.1,that's effective and safe. 
4138.38,"And so in our research, "
4141.44,and why it's become a really important addition 
4144.59,to our knowledge 
4145.76,is that we have electrodes directly recording 
4149.24,from the human brain surface. 
4152.09,A lot of the technology we work with right now 
4154.46,"is recording on the order of millimeters, "
4157.73,and they can record millisecond time resolution 
4162.17,"of neural activity, "
4164.06,and what we see is extraordinary patterns of activity 
4169.79,when people hear words and sentences. 
4172.85,If you look at that part of the brain 
4174.47,that we call Wernicke's area 
4175.54,"in this part of the temporal lobe, "
4177.68,this whole area lights up when you hear words or speech. 
4183.05,And it's not in a way 
4184.73,that is like a general light bulb warming up 
4188.09,"and it's generally lit up, "
4190.73,but what you actually see 
4191.63,"is something much, much more complicated, "
4194.3,"which is a pattern of activity, "
4196.58,and what we've done in the last 
10,years 
4198.92,is try to understand what does that pattern come from? 
4202.91,And if we were to look at each individual site 
4205.37,"from that part of the brain, what would we see? "
4209.75,What parts of words are being coded by electrical activity 
4214.36,in those parts of the brain? 
4215.3,"Remember, the cortex is using electrical activity "
4218.39,"to transmit information and do analysis, "
4222.41,and what we're doing is we're eavesdropping 
4224.45,on this part of the brain as it's processing speech 
4227.93,to try to understand what each individual site is doing. 
4231.05,"- And what are those sites doing, "
4232.88,or could you give us some examples 
4234.26,of what those sites are doing? 
4235.22,"So, for instance, are they sites that are specific for, "
4239.89,or we could say even listening for consonants or for vowels 
4243.59,or for inflection or for emotionality? 
4248.93,What's in there? 
4249.83,"- [Eddie] Okay, well- "
4250.663,"- What makes these, what makes these cells fire? "
4253.7,"- Yeah, what gets them excited? "
4255.44,- Yeah. - What gets them going 
4256.85,is hearing speech. 
4258.56,"In particular, there are some of these really focal sites, "
4262.85,"again, just on the order of millimeter "
4264.62,"or, at some level, single neurons "
4267.65,"that are tuned to consonants, some are tuned to vowels, "
4272.3,some are tuned to particular features of consonants. 
4276.26,What I mean by that are different categories of consonants. 
4281.6,There's a class of consonants 
4282.98,that we call plosive consonants. 
4284.593,"This is a little bit of linguistic jargon, "
4286.97,but I'm going to make a point here with that 
4288.38,"is that certain classes of sounds, when you make them, "
4291.35,it requires you to actually close your mouth temporarily. 
4294.29,- Hmm. Now I'm going to be thinking about this. 
4297.56,"So plosive, like plosive, "
4299.298,like saying the word plosive requires that. 
4301.7,"- Exactly, so what's cool about that "
4304.07,is that we actually have no idea 
4306.56,what's going on in our mouth when we speak. 
4309.26,We really have no idea. 
4310.52,- Some people definitely have no idea. 
4312.183,[Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] 
4313.43,"- Well, not just like in terms "
4314.54,"of what you're saying sometimes, "
4316.07,"but actually like how you're actually moving, "
4319.55,"you know, the different parts of vocal tract. "
4321.08,"And I have a feeling if we actually required understanding, "
4325.91,we would never be able to speak 'cause it's so complex. 
4328.55,It's such a complex feat. 
4329.75,Some people would say it's the most complex motor thing 
4332.81,that we do as a species is just speaking. 
4335.42,"Not, you know, the extreme feats of acrobatics "
4338.81,or athleticism but speaking. 
4341.48,"- And especially when one observes, you know, opera "
4344.87,"or people who, you know, freestyle rappers. "
4348.56,And of course it's not just the lips. It's the tongue. 
4352.25,And you've mentioned two other structures 
4355.22,Pharynx and larynx are the main ones. 
4358.136,"Can you tell us, just educate us at a superficial level "
4361.52,what the pharynx and larynx do differentially? 
4364.767,'Cause I think most people aren't going to 
4366.35,"be familiar with that. - Okay, sure. "
4367.67,So I'll talk primarily 
4370.52,"about the larynx here for a second, "
4373.43,"which is that if you think about when we're speaking, "
4377.57,"really, what we're doing is we're shaping the breath. "
4380.81,"So even before you get to the larynx, "
4382.43,you got to start with the expiration. 
4386.12,So we fill up our lungs and then we push the air out. 
4391.55,That's a normal part of breathing. 
4394.07,And what is really amazing about speech and language 
4396.97,is that we evolved to take advantage 
4399.59,"of that normal physiologic thing, add a larynx, "
4403.49,"and what the larynx does is that when you're exhaling, "
4406.49,it brings the vocal folds together. 
4408.83,Some people call them vocal cords. 
4410.93,They're not really cords. They're really vocal folds. 
4413.45,"They're two pieces of tissue that come together, "
4415.85,and a muscle brings them together. 
4417.68,And then what happens 
4418.513,is when the air comes through the vocal folds 
4421.01,"when they're together, "
4421.843,"they vibrate at really high frequencies, "
4425.324,like 
100,to 
200,hertz. 
4427.4,Yours is probably about 
100,hertz. 
4430.008,The average- - Whereas yours is 
200.,
4431.48,[Andrew laughs] 
4432.471,"- No, no. Most male voices are around "
"100,",okay? 
4435.98,And then the average female voice around 
200,hertz. 
4438.679,"- Well, and as you know, I've always had the same voice. "
4440.69,"- Yes, yes, the same- - This was a point of shame "
4442.13,when I was a kid. 
4443.24,"Folks, my voice never changed. I always had the same voice. "
4446.15,This is a discussion for another time. 
4447.77,"- Yeah, well, it's a great voice, "
4449.81,"you know, a great baritone voice, "
4451.7,"but I know in your voice, it's a low-frequency voice. "
4455.9,And the reason why men and women 
4458.06,generally have different voice qualities 
4461.78,is it has to do with the size of the larynx 
4464.75,"and the shape of it, okay? "
4466.34,"So in general, men have a larger voice box or larynx, "
4470.72,"and the vibrating frequency, the resonance frequency "
4473.45,of the vocal folds when the air comes through them 
4476.78,is about 
100,hertz for men and about 
200,for women. 
4480.26,"So what happens is, "
4483.02,"okay, so you take a breath in, "
4486.71,"and then as the air is coming out, "
4489.8,the vocal folds come together and the air goes through. 
4492.47,"That creates the sound of the voice that we call voicing, "
4497.48,and that's the energy of your voice. 
4499.88,"It's not just your voice characteristic, "
4502.67,it's the energy of your voice. 
4505.07,"It's coming from the larynx there, it's a noise. "
4509.9,And then it's the source of the voice. 
4512.99,"And then what happens is that energy, "
4515.57,"that sound goes up through the parts of the vocal tract, "
4519.65,"like the pharynx into the oral cavity, "
4523.82,which is your mouth and your tongue and your lips. 
4526.85,And what those things are doing 
4528.92,is that they're shaping the air in particular ways 
4533.24,that create consonants and vowels. 
4536.93,So that's what I mean by shaping the breath. 
4540.11,It just starts with this exhalation. 
4543.11,"You generate the voice in the larynx, "
4545.63,"and then everything above the larynx is moving around, "
4549.05,"just like the way my mouth is doing right now, "
4551.33,to shape that air into particular patterns 
4555.931,that you can hear as words. 
4559.19,"- Fascinating, and immediately makes me wonder "
4564.2,about more primitive or non-learned vocalizations 
4569.0,like crying or laughter. 
4571.07,"Babies will cry, babies will show laughter. "
4574.73,Are those sorts of vocalizations 
4579.2,"produced by the language areas like Wernicke's, "
4582.35,or do they have their own unique neural structures? 
4585.53,"- Yeah, interesting question. "
4586.97,So we call those vocalizations. 
4591.17,A vocalization is basically where someone 
4593.63,"can create a sound, like a cry or a moan, "
4598.88,"that kind of sound, "
4600.32,and it also involves the exhalation of air. 
4604.85,It also involves some phonation at the level larynx 
4608.21,where the vocal folds come together 
4610.22,to create that audible sound. 
4613.22,"But it turns out that those are actually different areas, "
4616.34,so people who have injuries in the speech and language areas 
4620.36,"oftentimes can still moan, they can still vocalize, "
4623.96,"and it is a different part of the brain, "
4625.88,I would say an area that even nonhuman primates have 
4629.81,"that can be specialized, you know, for vocalization. "
4632.9,It's a different form of communication 
4635.42,"than words, for example. "
4637.7,- The intricacy of these circuits in the brain 
4640.07,"and their connections to the pharynx and larynx is just, "
4645.17,it's almost overwhelming 
4646.58,"in terms of thinking about just how complicated it must be, "
4649.4,and yet some general features and principles 
4651.92,are starting to emerge from your work 
4653.48,and from the work of others. 
4656.33,If we think about that work 
4658.07,"and we think about, for instance, Wernicke's area, "
4662.06,if I were to record from neurons in Wernicke's area 
4667.13,"at different locations, "
4668.24,would I find that there's any kind of systematic layout? 
4672.71,"For instance, in terms of, you talked about sound frequency, "
4675.65,we know that low frequencies 
4676.73,are represented at one end of a structure 
4678.38,and high frequencies at the other. 
4679.55,"This is true actually, at least from my earlier training, "
4682.19,"within the ear itself, within the cochlea, "
4684.74,"the early work of von Bekesy and from cadavers, right? "
4687.56,"They actually figured this out from dead people, "
4689.42,which is incredible. 
4690.62,A fascinating literature people should look up. 
4695.03,"And in the visual system, "
4695.96,"we know that, for instance, you know, visual position, "
4700.97,where things are is mapped systematically. 
4703.37,"In other words, "
4704.203,neurons that sit next to each other in the brain 
4706.25,represent portions of visual space 
4708.65,that are next to each other in the real world. 
4711.08,What is the organization of language 
4713.93,in areas like Wernicke's and Broca's? 
4716.18,"For instance, I think of the vowels, A, E, I, O, U, "
4720.89,"as kind of a coherent unit, "
4723.05,but do I find the A neurons are next to the E neurons 
4726.59,"or next to the A, E, I, O, U. "
4730.7,"Is that vowel representation also laid out in order, "
4735.05,"or is it kind of salt and pepper, is it random? "
4737.99,"- That's been one of the, like, most important questions "
4740.66,we've been trying to answer for the past decade. 
4743.45,So there is a part of the brain 
4746.06,"that we call the primary auditory cortex, "
4748.28,and the primary auditory cortex 
4750.23,is deep in the temporal lobe. 
4751.43,"And if you looked at that part of the brain, "
4755.24,there is a map of different sound frequencies. 
4758.42,"So if you look at the front of that primary auditory cortex, "
4761.72,"you'll find low-frequency sounds, "
4763.46,"and then as you march backwards in that cortex, "
4768.35,it goes from low to medium to high frequencies. 
4771.02,It's organized in this really nice and orderly way. 
4774.92,And it turns out there's not just one. 
4776.63,"There's, like, mirrors of that tone frequency map "
4780.95,in the primary auditory cortex. 
4783.68,The areas that are really important for speech 
4786.83,are on the side of that. 
4788.57,And we now think that speech 
4791.9,can go straight to the speech cortex 
4793.94,"without having to go through the primary auditory cortex, "
4797.063,that it has its own pathway to get to the part of the brain 
4802.37,that processes speech. 
4804.68,"And when we've looked at that question about is there a map, "
4809.33,"the short answer is yes, there is a map, "
4814.01,but it is not structured universally across all people 
4818.174,in a way that we can clearly see right now. 
4821.12,It is like a salt and pepper map 
4823.67,of the different features in speech. 
4825.92,"So before, we talked about these sounds "
4827.69,that are called plosives. 
4829.43,You make a plosive when the mouth 
4832.13,"or something in the oral cavity closes temporarily, "
4835.07,"and when it opens, "
4837.47,that creates that fast plosive sound. 
4841.22,So when you say dad 
4845.0,"or, you know, like the B in ball, "
4850.4,"that kind of thing, "
4851.39,"you will notice that your lips actually close, "
4854.09,and then it's the release of that 
4855.35,"that creates that particular sounds, okay? "
4857.96,So those are the sounds that we call plosive. 
4859.76,"Those are like ba da ga, pa ta ka, "
4864.41,Those are a certain class of consonants 
4865.673,that we call plosive sounds. 
4868.19,There is another class of sounds 
4869.87,that we call fricatives in linguistics. 
4873.05,Fricatives are created by turbulence 
4876.47,"in the airstream as it comes out through the mouth, "
4881.652,and the way that we make that turbulence 
4884.6,is getting the mouth and the lips to close 
4887.51,almost until they're completely shut 
4890.72,or putting the tongue to near the teeth 
4893.78,to almost get it completely shut 
4896.3,"but just have a narrow aperture, "
4898.34,that creates a turbulence in the airflow 
4900.59,that we perceive as a high-frequency sound. 
4902.21,"So those are the sounds like sha and tha, "
4906.2,those kind of things. 
4907.04,"Those are, if you look at the frequencies, "
4908.81,"they're higher frequencies, "
4909.95,and those are created by specific movements 
4912.95,"that you constrict the airflow to create turbulence, "
4915.23,"and we hear it as sha, sa, tha. "
4920.81,- So if I say that. 
4922.28,- [Eddie] Exactly. 
4923.12,- And as opposed to a plosive where I'd say explosive. 
4927.26,- [Eddie] Right. 
4928.093,"- Of course, I'm emphasizing here. "
4929.18,"Well, this explains something and solves a mystery, "
4931.88,which is recently I've been fascinated by the work 
4934.07,"of a physician scientist back east, "
4938.69,"Dr. Shanna Swan, who's done a lot of work "
4940.46,on things that are contained in pesticides and foods 
4943.34,"that are changing hormone levels, "
4945.38,"and she refers to phthalates, which is spelled... "
4948.89,"So it's both a plosive and a tha, "
4951.14,"so it's combining the two, "
4952.13,and it's one of the most difficult words 
4953.93,"in the English language to pronounce, "
4955.7,second only perhaps 
4956.93,to the correct pronunciation of ophthalmology. 
4959.547,[Eddie laughs] [Andrew laughs] 
4961.28,So it's a combination of a plosive 
4963.98,"and one of these tha sounds, "
4965.96,and that's probably why it's difficult. 
4967.58,- That's exactly right. 
4968.54,"In fact, we have a term for that. "
4970.76,That's called a consonant cluster. 
4972.26,"So sometimes syllables will just have one consonant, "
4975.41,"but when we start stacking certain syllables in a sequence, "
4978.68,and there's rules that actually govern which consonants 
4982.34,"can be in a particular sequence for a given language, "
4986.51,that makes it more complicated. 
4987.83,And certain languages 
4988.85,have a lot more constant clusters than others. 
4992.27,"- For instance- - So for instance, "
4993.86,"Russian, for example, has a lot of consonant clusters. "
4996.74,English has a lot of them. 
4998.48,"There are other languages that have very, very few. "
5002.26,"For example, Hawaiian. "
5004.3,Hawaiian has an inventory 
5005.38,of about 
12,to 
14,"different phonemes, "
5008.38,
14,different consonants and vowels. 
5010.63,"English, on contrast, "
5011.71,has about 
40,different consonants and vowels. 
5015.25,So languages have different inventories. 
5017.86,"They can overlap for sure, "
5019.87,"but different languages use different sound elements, "
5023.86,combine and recombine those elements 
5025.57,to give rise to different words and meanings. 
5028.27,- Can we say that there is a most complicated language 
5031.51,"out there, or among the most complicated? "
5033.16,Would it be Russian? 
5034.21,- It's definitely high up there. 
5035.53,"English is up there, too, actually. Yeah, German as well. "
5039.16,- And in terms of learning multiple languages 
5040.93,"during development, "
5041.763,my understanding is that if one 
5043.06,"wants to become bilingual or trilingual, "
5045.94,best to learn those languages simultaneously 
5048.52,"during development, ideally before age "
"12,",
5051.37,if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later. 
5054.58,"Is that correct, or do you want to revise that? "
5056.44,"- Well, basically, the earlier, "
5060.19,"and the earlier is better, "
5062.59,"the more intense it is and the more immersive it is, "
5066.79,"the longer, you know, that you can be exposed to that "
5069.85,is really important. 
5070.683,A lot of people can get exposed to it early 
5072.43,and basically lose it. 
5073.48,"Even though it's, quote, unquote, "
5075.19,"during that sensitive period, "
5076.72,"unless it's maintained, it can be very easily lost. "
5080.17,Then I think another aspect of it that's very interesting 
5082.84,is some of the social requirements for it too. 
5087.31,It's pretty clear that you can only go so far 
5091.96,just listening to these sounds from a tape recording 
5094.69,or something like that. 
5096.25,There's something extra about real human interactions 
5100.21,that activates the brain's sensitivity 
5102.37,to different speech sounds 
5103.717,and allows us to become specialized for them 
5105.82,for a given language. 
5107.86,"- So returning to what's mapped, "
5110.23,"what the representations are in the brain, "
5113.02,I'm starting to get a picture now 
5115.21,based on these plosives and these tha sounds. 
5118.81,And what I find so interesting and logical about that 
5122.65,is it maps to the motor structures 
5124.777,"and the actual pronunciation of the sounds, "
5126.88,not necessarily to the meaning of the individual words. 
5131.29,"Now, of course, it's related to the meaning "
5132.64,"of the individual words, "
5134.29,but it makes good sense to me 
5136.81,"why something as complex as language, "
5140.44,"both to understand and to generate, "
5142.66,would map to something that is essentially motor in design 
5146.38,"because, as you point out, I have to generate these sounds "
5150.34,and I have to hear them generated from others. 
5153.28,"However, there's reading and there's writing, "
5156.91,"and writing is certainly motor, "
5159.79,reading involves some motor commands 
5161.62,of the eyes and et cetera. 
5164.44,Where do reading and writing come into this picture? 
5167.17,"Are they in parallel with, as we would say in neuroscience, "
5170.98,or are they embedded within the same structures? 
5173.98,Are they part of the same series of computations? 
5178.51,"- Yeah, so to address the first part "
5184.15,is that we've got this map 
5186.01,"of these different parts of consonants and vowels, "
5189.01,and when we look at how they lay out 
5193.45,"in this part of the brain that we call Wernicke's area, "
5196.21,we've spent a lot of time really just dissecting this 
5199.24,millimeter by millimeter. 
5201.85,The term that you used is very apropos. 
5203.83,It's salt and pepper. It's not random. 
5206.14,There is this kind of selectivity 
5208.21,to these individual speech sounds. 
5210.01,"And one point I want to make about it is this, "
5212.14,"is that in English, for example, "
5214.96,there are about 
40,different phonemes. 
5216.852,Phonemes are just consonants or vowels 
5218.53,or individual speech segments. 
5221.29,"But these articulatory features that you refer to, "
5225.73,"for example, the characteristic sounds "
5229.03,"that are generated by specific movements in the mouth, "
5233.59,you can more or less reduce that 
5235.12,to about 
12,different features. 
5238.63,"Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue, "
5241.6,"the jaw, the lips, the larynx. "
5244.54,There are about 
12,"of these movements, "
5247.48,"and just like you said, Andrew, "
5249.94,"by themselves, they have no meaning. "
5253.03,They're just movements. 
5254.92,But what's incredible about it 
5256.233,is that you take these 
12,movements 
5258.52,and you put them in combinations 
5261.01,and you start putting them in sequence. 
5264.91,We as humans use those 
12,set features 
5267.88,to generate all words. 
5270.55,And because we can generate 
5271.84,nearly an infinite number of words 
5273.61,with that code of just 
12,"features, "
5277.03,we have something 
5278.32,that generates essentially all possible meaning 
5281.65,"because that's what we do as humans, we generate meanings, "
5284.86,"I'm trying to communicate one idea to another, "
5287.08,"which, to me, is extraordinary. "
5289.39,"A parallel would be, for example, DNA. "
5291.88,"There's four base pairs in DNA, "
5294.55,but with those four base pairs in a specific sequence 
5298.27,can generate an entire code for life. 
5301.21,And speech is the same way. 
5302.38,It's like you've got these fundamental elements 
5305.05,"that, by themselves, have no meaning, "
5306.58,but when you put them together 
5307.81,give rise to every possible meaning. 
5311.38,So with regard to your second point 
5315.01,"about reading and writing, it's a fascinating question. "
5319.12,Speech and language is part of who we are as humans. 
5324.91,"That's part of how we evolved, "
5327.25,and it's hardwired 
5330.19,"and, you know, molded by experience. "
5334.51,Reading and writing are a human invention. 
5339.97,It's something that was added on 
5341.71,to the architecture of the brain. 
5343.78,And because reading and writing 
5345.94,"are fairly recent in human evolution, "
5349.3,it's essentially too quick 
5350.83,"for anything to, like, have a dramatic change "
5353.2,"in, let's say, a new brain area "
5355.63,or some kind of specialization. 
5357.01,"Instead, what happens is that whenever any kind of behavior "
5361.27,"becomes ultra specialized in any of us or any organism, "
5366.37,we can sort of take some areas 
5369.55,"that are normally involved with vision, for example, "
5372.85,and specialize it for the purpose of reading. 
5375.85,So all of us have a part of our brain 
5378.55,in the back of the temporal lobe 
5379.72,that interfaces with the occipital visual cortex 
5383.68,that we call a visual word form area. 
5385.99,There's actually a part of the brain that is very sensitive 
5390.46,"to seeing words, like, either typed or handwritten. "
5395.2,There's a part of the brain that also is sensitive 
5397.96,to seeing things like faces. 
5400.75,So these are things that are all conditioned 
5402.85,"on what's important, you know, to survive. "
5408.07,"So reading and writing are an invention, "
5410.5,and there are things that have mapped 
5412.96,to functions that the brain already has. 
5417.01,And one of the really important things 
5419.8,about reading and writing 
5421.0,"is that when we learn to read and write, "
5425.53,"especially with the reading part, "
5427.3,it maps to the part of the brain 
5429.16,"that we've been talking about, "
5430.39,which is the part that's processing speech sounds. 
5434.29,"So some of us kind of think about it, "
5436.03,these are two different things. 
5437.02,"One is hearing sounds through your ears, "
5440.17,the other is reading 
5441.13,where you're actually seeing things through your eyes 
5444.28,and then getting into the language system. 
5446.11,"Well, it turns out that the auditory speech cortex "
5450.79,is the primal and primitive fundamental area 
5454.72,"that's really important for speech, "
5455.827,and what happens with the reading 
5457.93,"is once it gets through that visual cortex, "
5461.68,it's going to try to map those reading signals 
5465.22,to the part of the brain 
5466.12,"that's trying to make sense of sounds, "
5468.82,"the sounds of words, what we call phonology. "
5472.57,"Now, why is this important? "
5474.28,It has a lot of relevance to how we learn to write. 
5479.98,And in some kids with dyslexia... 
5483.76,Dyslexia is a neurological condition 
5487.03,"where a child, in some cases, an adult, "
5490.84,"has trouble reading, for example. "
5494.65,"And in many of those cases, "
5497.32,it's because that mapping between how we see the words 
5501.94,to the way that the brain processes the sounds 
5505.84,"is something different, "
5507.22,it's a little bit different 
5508.39,than people who can read really well. 
5511.81,"So when you're reading, a lot of times, "
5513.97,you're actually activating the part of the brain 
5516.28,that is processing the words that you hear. 
5520.6,- What is the current treatment for dyslexia? 
5526.06,I've heard that it's a deficit 
5527.92,in some of the motion processing systems 
5530.26,of the visual system. 
5531.88,"You know, people, their eyes are jumping "
5533.41,"as opposed to more linear reading across, "
5535.57,or I suppose if it were Chinese it would be... 
5537.76,"You know, I don't want to presume "
5538.93,people are always reading English. 
5540.22,"Or I suppose if it's Hebrew, "
5541.33,they're going from the opposite side of the page. 
5545.71,What can be done for dyslexia? 
5547.75,And do any of the modern treatments for dyslexia 
5551.08,involve changing things from the speech side 
5554.8,"as opposed to just the, quote, unquote, reading side, "
5557.02,given that speech and reading are interconnected? 
5559.33,"- Yeah, absolutely. "
5560.35,"So, again, I think in the beginning, "
5562.42,people might have thought 
5563.41,this was purely a visual abstraction 
5566.38,"or something really just about the visual system, "
5568.75,but there's been more recognition 
5571.0,"that it could be both or it could be either, "
5573.88,depending on the particular instance. 
5577.21,It's very clear that there are many kids with dyslexia 
5580.93,where the problem is a problem of a phonological awareness. 
5585.31,"So, you know, it can be very hard to detect "
5589.72,"because they may understand the words that you were saying, "
5592.18,"but because the brain is so good at pattern recognition, "
5596.08,sometimes even if the individual speech sounds 
5598.27,"are not crystal clear, it can compensate that, "
5600.82,so that you can have an individual who can hear the words 
5604.48,but not be able to essentially hear them 
5608.62,when they're reading those same words. 
5610.687,And so what can happen with that 
5613.3,is that you can have this disconnection 
5615.79,between what they're seeing 
5618.19,and what they need in order to hear it as words 
5620.56,and process it as language. 
5622.45,And so skilled readers 
5626.65,usually need that route first. 
5628.6,They've got to map the vision to the sound 
5631.45,in order to get that sort of like foundation. 
5633.52,"But then over time, the reading has its direct connection "
5637.3,"to the language parts of the brain, "
5639.19,and we don't necessarily always need to map to sounds. 
5643.08,"You know, you can basically develop a parallel route, "
5646.12,"and we, as readers, actually use both all the time. "
5650.2,"So for example, if it's a new word "
5651.97,"that you've never seen before, "
5653.65,"sometimes you try to, like, pronounce it in your mind, "
5656.65,"you know, and try to hear what that word is. "
5659.62,"Even though you're not actually saying it, "
5661.21,you're trying to just generate 
5662.32,what those sounds might be like. 
5665.047,And that's the part where we're kind of relying 
5668.47,"on how we learn to read in the first place, "
5671.08,which is mapping those word images 
5673.6,"to the sounds that, you know, go along with them. "
5676.39,"But in other times, if you're a really proficient reader, "
5679.45,you're just seeing the words 
5680.56,and you can map them directly to meaning 
5682.45,without having to go through that process. 
5687.04,"- Yeah, I'm a big fan of listening to audiobooks, "
5689.44,"and of course I also listen to podcasts quite a lot, "
5693.4,"but I also am a strong believer, "
5695.44,"based on the research that I've seen, "
5697.54,"that reading books, physical books, "
5699.88,"it could be on a Kindle, I suppose, "
5701.02,but reading a physical book is useful 
5704.38,for being able to articulate well and structure sentences 
5709.54,"and build what are essentially paragraphs, "
5711.37,which is what I'm required to do 
5712.39,when I do solo episodes of the podcast. 
5716.05,I've noticed over the years 
5717.43,as text messaging has become more popular 
5722.23,and there's essentially an erosion of punctuation 
5726.22,"or the need to have complete sentences, "
5727.96,and now that's sort of transferred to email as well. 
5731.47,It's become acceptable 
5732.64,"to just say, you know, fragmented sentences in email. "
5738.4,It seems likely that it's starting to impact 
5740.89,the way that people speak as well. 
5742.93,And I don't think this has anything to do with intelligence 
5745.12,"or education level, "
5747.04,but are you aware of any evidence 
5750.28,that how we read and what we read 
5753.82,and whether or not we consume information 
5756.7,"purely through reading or mainly through auditory sources, "
5760.27,does it change the way that we speak? 
5761.71,"Because, after all, Wernicke's and Broca's area "
5764.47,and the other auditory and speech production areas 
5767.26,"are heavily intermeshed, "
5769.897,and so it would make perfect sense to me that what we hear 
5773.977,and the patterns of sound that are being communicated to us 
5776.47,would also change the way that we speak. 
5778.96,"- Yeah, that's a really fascinating point. "
5783.58,There is this idea 
5784.63,"that there's, like, this proper way to speak, "
5787.39,"like that there's the right way, for example, "
5791.11,"what are the appropriate, you know... "
5792.7,"Like, for example, in school, you're oftentimes told, like, "
5797.477,"""You should say it like this, "
5798.52,"not say it like that,"" you know? "
5800.17,And every language kind of has that. 
5802.06,It turns out that that's really unnatural. 
5805.24,"Languages, and speech in particular, change over time, "
5809.44,"it evolves, and it can happen very quickly. "
5814.18,"You know, the things that we call dialects, for example, "
5816.607,"are just different ways of speaking, "
5817.867,and someone can just be in one environment 
5819.91,"and change from one dialect to another, "
5822.31,"and some people, it kind of is really fixed. "
5826.6,"And there is this idea that, you know, like in school "
5831.04,"that we're told that there's this right way, "
5833.32,"but in reality, that's not true. "
5837.01,"Like, language change and speech change "
5839.14,"is completely normal and happens all the time, "
5843.13,and it can be really dramatic. 
5845.11,"Like, certain cultures and communities, "
5847.33,"if they are isolated, "
5849.16,"they can develop a whole new language, "
5850.57,"a whole new set of words, for example, "
5853.33,and new ways and dialects that are independent from people 
5857.05,to the point where it's unintelligible even to others. 
5861.01,And so the basic idea is that sound change 
5866.14,"is part of the way it works, "
5868.84,and the brain is very sensitive to those kind of changes. 
5873.58,"- Speaking of learning new languages, "
5876.46,I'm assuming it's possible to learn new languages 
5878.92,"throughout the lifespan, correct? "
5881.02,- [Eddie] Yeah. 
5882.01,- I've also heard these kind of fantastical stories 
5885.34,of somebody has a stroke 
5887.35,"and then suddenly, spontaneously, can speak French fluently, "
5892.18,"whereas prior to the stroke, they could not. "
5894.91,Is there any merit to those stories whatsoever? 
5897.402,[Eddie laughs] 
5898.235,I find it very hard to believe 
5900.31,that there was a complete map representation 
5902.77,of a language in somebody's brain 
5904.27,"that they were completely unaware of, "
5906.76,"and then because of damage to a brain area, "
5910.63,that capacity to speak that language was somehow unveiled. 
5914.29,"It just seems too wild, "
5916.87,and I don't want to say good to be true 
5918.43,"because nobody wants a stroke, "
5920.02,but it just seems out outrageously implausible. 
5924.04,"- Well, there are aspects of that "
5925.66,that certainly are implausible. 
5927.4,So I don't know of any true case that I've ever seen 
5931.45,or experienced myself or even read about 
5934.3,"where, for example, there was an injury to the brain "
5936.91,"that resulted in loss of, "
5941.32,"well, essentially a gain of function, "
5943.21,"meaning, like, just all of a sudden "
5945.97,started speaking another language. 
5948.4,"So for example, if you had a stroke "
5949.66,"and you never spoke French, "
5951.25,and then you had it 
5952.21,"and then all of a sudden you're speaking, "
5954.31,"that, I've never heard of and never seen. "
5956.86,"However, there is a condition that is well acknowledged "
5961.78,and I have seen one case of this 
5963.04,"called a foreign accent syndrome, "
5965.71,which is peculiar because there are people 
5969.58,who have an injury to the part of the brain 
5971.83,where it sounds like they're starting 
5974.62,"to speak this other language, "
5976.12,"but they're not actually speaking the language, "
5977.94,it just sounds like it. 
5980.62,And this goes back to what we were talking about earlier 
5983.65,about these areas that are really important 
5986.47,"for speech control of the vocal tract, "
5989.8,this area in the precentral gyrus. 
5992.59,People have documented 
5994.3,"where, you know, patients have had strokes there, "
5997.21,"and after that, it sounds like they're speaking Spanish "
6001.74,as opposed to English 
6002.82,or it sounds like they have the intonational properties 
6005.91,of French or Russian 
6008.34,as compared to their original native language. 
6011.61,"They're not learning all the rest of it, "
6013.14,"like the meaning and the grammar, et cetera, "
6016.65,"but they're adopting some of the phonology, "
6020.43,and part of that is just because it's not working 
6023.52,the way it normally does. 
6025.59,So there is something 
6026.423,actually called a foreign accent syndrome 
6028.38,that people can have after a stroke. 
6031.8,- Interesting. I'm curious about auditory memory. 
6034.74,"When I was a kid, I used to get into bed at night, "
6037.98,and I'd close my eyes and I would replay conversations 
6042.09,that I had heard during the day or people's voices. 
6044.76,I actually can remember calling your house 
6047.07,"when we were young kids, "
6048.39,and because I don't speak any Chinese 
6050.1,"but I'd have to ask for you, "
6051.78,"I'd say, I think it was, Eddie [speaking Chinese]. "
6054.668,- Yeah. 
6055.501,"- Yeah, and then whoever answered the phone "
6059.284,"would go get you, and then I'd say [speaking Chinese], "
6060.72,"which I believe means thank you, right? "
6062.58,"That's the total of the Chinese that I speak, by the way, "
6066.06,but I will never forget that. 
6069.06,"I'll just never forget it, I hope. "
6070.71,"I suppose if I have a stroke or something of that sort, "
6072.81,"at some point, I'll forget it "
6073.71,and I won't know that I've forgotten it. 
6075.09,"But in all seriousness, I remember that to this day. "
6078.36,"I couldn't spell that out, I wouldn't know how, "
6080.61,"certainly not in Chinese, "
6082.867,"but even a transliteration, "
6084.51,I couldn't do using English letters. 
6090.21,Where are memories of sounds stored? 
6094.89,"Because within our days and across our lives, "
6098.07,"we have an infinite number of auditory experiences, "
6102.75,just like we have an infinite number of visual experiences. 
6106.2,"Where are they stored, "
6107.033,and what is the structure of their storage? 
6108.78,"What am I calling upon, "
6111.21,"besides, of course, the motor commands "
6113.4,"that are required to say what I just said in Chinese, "
6116.04,"which I won't repeat again, "
6117.06,"'cause I somehow managed to get it right the first time, "
6119.45,"or at least not terribly wrong, "
6120.93,then I don't want to botch it the second time. 
6123.6,"Where is that stored, and how does that work? "
6126.27,"And, more importantly, "
6128.07,"as I speak my native language, English, "
6130.23,am I pulling from a memory bank? 
6132.42,Because it doesn't feel like it. 
6134.04,I'm just telling you what I want to say. 
6137.13,I'm doing my best to communicate clearly and succinctly. 
6140.85,I'm usually not so good at the succinct part. 
6142.83,But where is the bank of information? 
6147.0,"On my keyboard on my computer, I have the letters, "
6151.05,and I have certain elements of punctuation and the space. 
6153.78,What am I pulling from? Am I pulling from those plosives? 
6158.94,"But if so, how can I do it so quickly? "
6162.39,"Even for people that speak slowly, "
6164.46,it appears more or less fluid. 
6167.43,"This, to me, is overwhelmingly impressive "
6171.54,that the brain can do that. 
6173.97,How does it do that? 
6176.46,"- Well, first of all, "
6178.11,I am impressed that 
35,years later... [laughs] 
6181.59,"- Well, I had to get ahold of you. [laughs] "
6182.56,"- Yeah, so I am impressed, "
35,"years later, "
6186.09,that you can still remember that. 
6189.93,- But only that. 
6191.46,"- That's fine, but I'm still very impressed. "
6196.11,But it clearly was something important to you. 
6199.44,So the short answer is that memory is very distributed. 
6204.69,So it's almost like the question that you asked me 
6207.84,is ill posed 'cause you asked me where? 
6211.95,"Well, it's not one specific area. "
6214.08,It's actually really distributed. 
6216.87,It's not just one particular area. 
6218.04,"In fact, I'm fairly certain "
6219.87,that if we were to injure that part of the brain 
6221.76,"called the Wernicke's area, "
6223.14,you may still even have memories of that. 
6226.44,People can have injuries of Broca's area 
6228.9,or certainly the precentral gyrus 
6230.85,"and be able to sing ""Happy Birthday,"" for example, "
6234.96,when it's embedded in melody 
6236.16,or highly rehearsed things like counting 
6239.76,"despite not being able to speak, which is incredible, right? "
6243.51,"It's like you can see a patient, "
6246.99,"for example, who can't really put together a sentence. "
6250.89,"You ask them, ""How are you feeling today?"" "
6251.877,And they can't even utter a word. 
6254.46,"But then you ask them to count sometimes, "
6256.287,and they'll get up to any number really. 
6259.17,And so there are some things 
6261.69,that are really built into our motor memory 
6264.33,and it's distributed. 
6265.44,"It's not one particular part of the brain, "
6267.51,it's actually multiple areas 
6269.43,where that memory is distributed. 
6270.84,And thank God that's the way it is 
6272.61,because it's very rare 
6277.83,in the kind of surgeries that I do 
6280.47,"where you go in, you remove a piece of the brain, "
6283.38,that someone forgets these kind of long-term memories 
6287.04,or these long-term motor skills that they have. 
6291.75,"That's very, very rare. "
6293.76,"It's the number one question a patient will ask me, "
6296.64,"like, ""Am I going to be the same? "
6297.81,"And am I going to remember, you know, my wife? "
6301.95,"Or am I going to remember, "
6304.8,"you know, these thoughts of my birthday "
6306.15,when I was 
10,"years old?"" "
6308.97,And I've never really seen that kind of severe amnesia 
6313.83,"unless it's a very, very severe injury "
6315.84,"that involves almost the entire brain, and thank God. "
6319.41,So a lot of that information 
6321.42,is really distributed across the entire brain. 
6326.19,"- Speaking of storage of and ability to speak, "
6331.17,you are doing some amazing work 
6333.81,"and have achieved some pretty incredible, "
6337.26,well-deserved recognition for your work 
6339.57,"in bringing language out of paralyzed people, "
6343.71,essentially allowing people 
6344.97,who are locked into a paralyzed state 
6347.91,or otherwise unable to articulate speech 
6351.72,"using brain-machine interfaces, "
6354.36,essentially translating the neural activity 
6357.36,of areas of the brain that would produce speech 
6360.81,"into hardware, "
6363.12,"wires and things of that sort, "
6367.26,"artificial, non-biological tools "
6369.54,in order to allow paralyzed people to communicate. 
6373.29,We will provide a link 
6374.22,to some of the popular press coverage of that work 
6376.647,and the original papers. 
6377.88,But if you would be so kind 
6379.83,"as to tell us what those experiments look like, "
6383.82,who these people are who are locked in 
6386.07,"and that you allow to communicate, "
6387.81,"and then especially interesting to me, "
6391.05,"some of the directions that you're taking this now, "
6393.51,"which is beyond just, you know, people being able to think "
6397.26,about what they want to say 
6398.46,"and words coming out on a screen or through a microphone, "
6400.92,but actually making the interactions 
6403.11,between these people and the real world 
6405.42,more elaborate and more real. 
6409.35,"If that seems mysterious to people, "
6410.79,I'm going to let Eddie tell you what they're doing with this 
6413.25,rather than put any more detail on it. 
6416.25,"- Oh, okay. Well, thanks for asking about this. "
6418.92,This has really been some of the exciting recent work 
6423.21,from the lab. 
6424.95,"So for the last decade, "
6426.9,"we've really been focusing on the basic science, "
6429.63,meaning trying to understand 
6431.4,how the brain extracts and produces speech sounds and words. 
6438.03,We've done a lot of work trying to figure out 
6440.28,how these parts of the brain 
6442.98,control these individual elements 
6444.36,that give rise to all words and meanings. 
6447.12,And so it was about six years ago 
6450.96,where we realized we actually have a pretty good idea 
6455.85,of how this code works. 
6459.48,We had identified all of these different elements 
6462.09,"that we could decode in epilepsy patients, for example, "
6465.24,when they had electrodes on the brain 
6467.49,"as part of their surgeries, "
6469.26,we could decode all of the different consonants 
6471.57,and vowels of English. 
6472.68,That was about six years ago. 
6474.69,"So a natural question was this, "
6477.36,"which is if we understand that electrical code, "
6481.02,can we use that to help someone who is paralyzed 
6485.55,and can't get those signals out of the brain 
6488.22,to speak normally? 
6490.65,And that's in the setting of people who are paralyzed. 
6493.56,"So there are a series of conditions, "
6496.86,they include things like brain stem stroke. 
6499.02,The brain stem is the part of the brain 
6500.97,"that connects the cerebrum, which is the top part, "
6503.91,"does our thinking and a lot of the motor control, "
6506.34,"speech, language, everything, "
6508.35,and the brain stem is what connects that 
6509.88,to the spinal cord and the nerves 
6511.35,that go out to the face and vocal tract. 
6512.97,"So if you have a stroke there, "
6514.92,"basically, you could be thinking all the wild, creative, "
6518.46,"intelligent thoughts you have in the mind and the cerebrum, "
6521.91,but you can't get them out into words 
6524.7,or you can't get them out to your hand to write them down. 
6528.45,So that's a very severe form of paralysis 
6530.46,called brain stem stroke. 
6532.47,There's another kind of conditions 
6534.48,that we call neurodegenerative 
6536.07,"where the nerve cells die basically, or atrophy, "
6540.93,"in a condition called ALS, "
6544.68,and that's a very severe form of paralysis. 
6548.46,"In its extreme form, "
6549.45,people essentially lose all voluntary movement. 
6552.21,- So Stephen Hawking would be a good example 
6554.07,"of someone with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease? "
6556.14,- He's an example of someone who had ALS 
6558.63,but not a great example of what typical course of ALS. 
6562.14,"So for reasons not clear, "
6565.53,the progression of his disease largely stabilized 
6568.38,"to the point where he could twitch, you know, a cheek muscle "
6572.04,"or move his eyes, let's say. "
6574.86,"In most people, it's very rapid, "
6577.8,"and many people, they die from it, actually, "
6580.56,"you know, within a couple of years of diagnosis, so- "
6583.42,"- Yeah, he lived a long time in that- "
6585.33,- He lived a long time- 
6586.532,- That slanted-over state 
6587.88,"in his wheelchair. - Right, exactly. "
6590.1,"But he wasn't breathing, "
6592.95,"you know, through a tube in his throat, for example, "
6595.2,"because people with severe ALS, "
6598.35,the muscles to their diaphragm and their lungs 
6601.29,essentially give out as well. 
6602.85,They get weakness there and then they can't breathe anymore. 
6605.28,So that's another form of paralysis. 
6608.85,"And so in our field, "
6611.88,these are kind of like the most devastating things 
6613.77,that can happen. 
6615.72,"I'm not going to really try to compare, like, what's worse, "
6618.45,"you know, having a brain tumor or a stroke, it's all bad. "
6621.9,But this condition of what we call being locked in 
6626.37,refers to this idea 
6627.96,that you can have completely intact cognition 
6633.18,"and awareness but have no way to express that, "
6637.59,"no voluntary movement, no ability to speak. "
6640.95,And that is devastating 
6642.24,"because psychologically and socially, "
6645.09,"you know, you're completely isolated. "
6647.1,"That's what we call locked-in syndrome, "
6649.08,and it's devastating. 
6650.25,"I've seen that throughout my career, "
6652.14,and it's really heartbreaking 
6654.15,because you know that the person is there 
6659.91,"but you can't see, they can't communicate. "
6662.85,So we've been studying this patterning 
6667.02,"of electrical activity for consonants and vowels, "
6669.66,"and essentially, once we figured out a lot of these codes "
6673.14,"for the individual phonetic elements, "
6676.71,"we took a little bit of a detour, "
6680.46,or at least part of the lab 
6681.48,started to focus on this very specific question. 
6684.6,"For people who have these kind of paralysis, "
6687.12,could we intercept those signals 
6691.14,"from the brain, the cerebral cortex, "
6693.84,"as someone is trying to say those words, "
6696.96,and then can we intercept them 
6698.49,and then have them taken out of the brain through wires 
6702.99,to a computer that are going to interpret those signals 
6706.17,and translate them into words? 
6708.9,"So about three years ago, "
6712.89,we started a clinical trial. 
6714.51,It's called the BRAVO trial. It's still underway. 
6717.45,And the first participant in the BRAVO trial 
6720.69,was a man who had been paralyzed for 
15,years. 
6726.66,When he was about 
20,"years old, "
6728.01,"he came to the United States, "
6730.08,was actually working in the Sonoma area 
6733.71,"and he was in a car accident, "
6735.66,and he actually walked out of the hospital 
6738.93,"day after that car accident, "
6741.21,"but the next day, had a complication related to it "
6745.32,"where he had a very large stroke in the brain stem, "
6749.55,and that turned out to be devastating. 
6751.98,He didn't wake up from that stroke for about a week. 
6754.89,He was in a coma for about a week. 
6757.14,"And when he woke up from that coma, "
6758.85,he realized that he couldn't speak or move his arms or legs. 
6763.11,"And as he told me or communicated to us, "
6767.76,that was absolutely devastating. 
6769.23,He wanted really to die at that time. 
6772.35,- Could he blink his eyes or move his mouth in any way? 
6775.17,"- He could blink his eyes, "
6776.91,he had some limited mouth movements 
6778.32,but couldn't produce any intelligible speech. 
6781.26,"It was, like, completely slurred and incomprehensible. "
6785.46,And he survived this injury. 
6788.37,A lot of people who have that kind of stroke 
6789.78,just don't survive. 
6791.49,But he survived. 
6792.66,"And I also realized that he's just an incredible person, "
6797.07,"like a force of nature in terms of his optimism, "
6800.64,in terms of his ability to make friends 
6802.44,despite his condition. 
6803.4,"The way he actually communicates, "
6805.68,"because he has a little bit of residual neck movements, "
6808.14,is that he improvised and had his friends 
6812.34,basically put a stick attached to his baseball cap. 
6817.02,"And because he could move his neck, "
6818.73,he would essentially type out letters on a keyboard screen 
6823.26,to get out words. 
6824.093,"In fact, this is how he communicated was through a device "
6827.22,that he would essentially peck out letters one by one 
6830.49,by moving his neck 
6831.96,to control this stick attached to his baseball cap. 
6834.84,- How many years did he use that method of communication? 
6838.47,- [Eddie] For about 
15,years. 
6839.76,He hadn't really spoken for about 
15,years. 
6842.22,"- Oh, goodness. "
6843.053,- Yeah. So it was a devastating injury. 
6846.81,"But, you know, there's something to be said "
6850.5,"about the human spirit, "
6852.75,"and if there's anyone who embodies it, it is Pancho, "
6856.02,"that's his nickname, the first participant in our trial. "
6860.43,"He has that human spirit, he persevered, "
6862.44,"and, in fact, you know, could thrive "
6864.6,"in his community, basically, and friends, "
6866.94,being able to communicate 
6867.773,in this very slow and inefficient way. 
6870.96,Maybe part of that spirit is why he volunteered 
6873.78,to be the first person in this trial. 
6876.12,"It was a clinical trial, an experiment. It was a study. "
6879.63,This is not an approved therapy by any means. 
6882.69,"This was really something that had not been done before, "
6885.99,"and we had a lot of ideas about it, but we didn't know. "
6890.067,"You know, we had proven a lot of this could be true "
6892.59,"in some people who are normally speaking, "
6895.05,"but to actually put it into someone who's paralyzed, "
6897.12,"number one, where we don't know the code is the same. "
6900.48,Number two is someone who's not been speaking for 
15,"years, "
6904.92,whether those signals are actually still there or not. 
6909.72,So it was part of a clinical trial. 
6911.55,"It was, you know, something that our hospital "
6915.51,"and also the FDA, you know, had to approve "
6917.94,"and looked at very carefully, "
6919.11,"but given a lot of the work that we had done, "
6921.21,there was some basis for why this might work. 
6924.93,"And so about two and a half years ago, "
6928.32,we did a surgery where we implanted electrodes 
6932.34,"onto the parts of the brain that we've been talking about, "
6935.04,"these areas that control the vocal tract, "
6937.62,"the areas that control the larynx, "
6939.03,the areas that control the lips and tongue and jaw movements 
6943.2,when we normally speak. 
6944.28,"These are areas that presumably may be active, "
6947.1,"that was our hope, in his brain, "
6949.11,but he just couldn't get those out 
6951.0,to control his mouth in a normal way. 
6955.11,"And he underwent a surgery, "
6956.31,a brain surgery where we put an electrode array 
6959.37,and we connected it to a port that was screwed to his skull. 
6965.43,"And the port actually goes through his scalp, "
6968.28,and he's lived with this now for the last three years. 
6971.79,It is a risk of infection. 
6973.32,These ports eventually have to become wireless 
6975.63,in the future. 
6976.463,But we've figured out a way to keep that port there 
6979.56,where we can essentially connect him to a computer 
6983.55,through that port. 
6986.4,So he has an electrode array that's implanted 
6989.22,"over the part of his brain that's important for speech, "
6992.76,"it's connected to a port, "
6995.37,and then we connect a wire to that port that translates 
6999.33,"those what we call analog, you know, brainwaves "
7003.17,and converts them into digital signals. 
7006.17,And then a computer takes those digital signals 
7009.95,from those individual sites from the speech cortex 
7013.46,and translates those into words. 
7016.07,- Can you describe for us the first time that Pancho spoke 
7020.9,through this engineered device? 
7023.72,What was that experience like for you? 
7025.67,"And, at least from what he conveyed to you, "
7027.92,what was that experience like for him? 
7030.38,"Because as somebody who was essentially locked-in, "
7032.36,"except for this, you know, rather crude pecking device, "
7035.36,although I'm thoroughly impressed by how adaptive 
7039.62,"or adaptable Pancho was, "
7041.327,and his friends engineering that device for him 
7043.85,is really nothing short of clever 
7047.9,"because otherwise he would be truly locked in, right? "
7050.96,But what was that moment like? I can only imagine. 
7054.47,- That moment was incredible. 
7056.9,It was truly incredible 
7058.94,to be able to see him try to get out a word 
7061.52,"that was, for all practical purposes, unintelligible, "
7066.29,but to be able to take the brain activity 
7068.21,and to translate it into text on a screen. 
7071.558,And that's what we did. 
7072.391,"We took those brainwaves, "
7073.4,we put them through a machine learning 
7076.07,or artificial intelligence algorithm 
7078.14,"that can pick up these very, very subtle patterns, "
7081.5,"you can't actually see them with your eye, "
7084.44,in the brain activity and translate those into words. 
7088.01,And I remember seeing this happening for the first time. 
7092.097,"You know, it doesn't happen, like, immediately. "
7094.58,This is something that took weeks to train the algorithm 
7098.96,to interpret it correctly. 
7102.35,But what was incredible about it was to see how he reacted. 
7106.73,"And he would be prompted to say a given word, "
7111.56,"like, you know, outside, for example, "
7115.25,"and then he would think about it, try to say it, "
7117.77,and finally those words would appear on the screen. 
7121.91,And what was really amazing about it 
7123.77,was you could really tell 
7126.8,"that he, like, got a kick out of that "
7128.45,"because he would start to giggle, "
7132.53,"you know, his body would shake in a way "
7134.99,and his head would shake in a way 
7136.22,"that he would start to giggle, and that was cool to see. "
7140.15,"But then I also realized that when he was giggling, "
7143.42,it kind of screwed up the next word's decoding. 
7145.908,[Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] 
7147.47,- Is that a bug you've since fixed? 
7149.72,"- No, we haven't fixed that. "
7151.01,- Interesting. 
7151.843,"- We haven't fixed that, "
7152.676,so it's easier just to tell him to stop giggling. 
7155.145,[Andrew laughs] [Eddie laughs] 
7156.62,- So what was the first word that he said? 
7158.81,"- Well, I think one of the first sentences "
7160.7,that he put together 
7161.81,"was, you know, can you get my family outside? "
7165.59,- Meaning get them out of the room? [laughs] 
7166.79,"- [Eddie] No, no. "
7167.63,"- All these years, he wanted to get away from his family? "
7169.55,"- No, I think what he meant was, can you get them- "
7171.59,"- Bring them in, yeah. - Bring them in. "
7172.79,And so the way this worked 
7175.04,was we trained this computer to recognize 
50,words. 
7179.72,We started with a very small vocabulary 
7182.48,that's expanding as we speak. 
7184.28,I think that this is just a matter of time 
7186.32,"before these vocabularies become much, much larger. "
7190.28,But we started with a 
50-set,of words. 
7192.62,We created essentially all the possible sentences 
7196.22,that you could generate from those 
50,words. 
7199.25,Why that was important 
7200.39,was you can use all those possible sentences 
7203.78,"to create a computational model, computer model "
7206.81,of all the different word combinations 
7209.21,to give different sentences given those 
50,"words, "
7212.96,and then you can essentially do what we call autocorrect. 
7216.53,It's the same kind of thing that we do 
7218.66,"when you're texting, for example. "
7220.61,"You get the wrong letter in there, "
7223.22,"but your phone actually knows, "
7225.98,"you know, because of its context what to correct it. "
7229.07,So because the decoding's not 
100%,"correct all the time, "
7232.85,"in fact, it's far from that, "
7234.98,it's really helpful 
7236.03,"to have these other features like autocorrect, "
7238.16,the stuff that we use routinely now with texting 
7240.95,that makes it correct and then updates it. 
7243.74,So it's a combination of a lot of things. 
7245.9,It's the AI that is translating 
7247.91,"those brain activity patterns, "
7250.19,but it's also things that we've learned 
7252.5,from speech and speech technologies 
7255.08,"that, you know, we put all together "
7257.0,"and then all of a sudden, it starts to work. "
7259.43,And so we were really excited 
7261.77,because that was the first time that someone was paralyzed 
7264.44,and could create words and sentences 
7267.98,that was just decoded from the brain activity. 
7270.5,"- Incredible, and I know you're very humble, "
7273.5,but I'm going to embarrass you by saying 
7274.7,I always knew you were destined for great things 
7277.52,since the early age of nine when we first became friends. 
7281.48,But when I read the news coverage of your work with Pancho 
7286.43,and the release of this language 
7289.07,"from this locked-in patient, "
7291.2,"it literally, you know, it brought tears to my eyes "
7293.57,"because, you know, it's an interesting thing "
7295.76,"as fellow neuroscientists, right, "
7297.86,"we explore the brain and we try and find mechanisms, "
7301.67,and we try and compare those to what other people find 
7304.16,"and find truths and principles and build up from those, "
7307.04,but pretty rarely is there a case 
7310.28,where that route of exploration 
7313.67,leads to something of clinical significance 
7316.85,within one's own lifetime. 
7318.53,"I mean, that's the reality of science, "
7320.18,and oftentimes it's a very distributed process. 
7323.3,"But in this case, it's been a magnificent thing "
7326.3,to see you move along this trajectory 
7329.45,parsing these language and speech areas 
7331.22,and then to also do the clinical work in parallel. 
7334.22,"Speaking of which, these days, "
7337.4,"we hear a lot about Neuralink, Elon Musk's company. "
7341.6,"A neurosurgeon that came up briefly through my lab, "
7344.51,"but I can't take any credit for what he knows or does, "
7346.85,which is Matt MacDougall is the neurosurgeon at Neuralink. 
7349.73,There's some other excellent neuroscientists there 
7351.44,and engineers there. 
7352.64,We hear a lot about Neuralink 
7353.72,because while brain-machine interface 
7357.83,of the sort that you do and that other laboratories do 
7360.89,"has been going on for a long time, "
7363.5,there's been some press around Neuralink 
7367.1,about the promise of what brain-machine interface could do. 
7370.46,"For instance, early in our discussion, "
7372.38,"you talked about how, you know, language is constrained "
7374.75,"by these sound waves, "
7375.68,"and typically, it's a few people communicating "
7378.17,or one person with many people 
7380.42,"through a podcast, for instance, or a speech. "
7383.54,But the idea has been thrown out there 
7385.73,that through the use of stimulating chips 
7388.55,or through other brain-machine devicing 
7392.0,that perhaps one could internalize 
7395.18,
50,"conversations in parallel, right? "
7397.94,
50X,"communication, "
7401.0,or that the memory systems could be augmented 
7404.21,to remember 
10,times as much information 
7406.66,or even twice as much information in a given period of time. 
7409.97,"My understanding of what they're doing at Neuralink, "
7412.37,"which is admittedly crude and from the outside, "
7415.76,"a few discussions with people there, "
7417.26,"is that they too are going to pursue clinical goals first, "
7421.55,things like trying to generate smooth movement 
7423.92,"in a Parkinsonian patient, "
7426.56,trying to adjust movement patterns 
7429.29,"in someone with Huntington's disease, for instance, "
7431.63,things of that sort 
7433.82,before they embark on the more sci-fi-like explorations 
7439.7,of 
50Xing,communication or doubling memory capacity 
7443.75,and these kinds of things. 
7444.583,"Although, I don't know, "
7445.416,they may be doing all of those things in parallel. 
7448.25,What are your thoughts about super capabilities of the brain 
7453.56,"or, I don't even know what word to use, "
7456.29,"you know, supercharging the brain, "
7457.58,"you know, giving the brain functions "
7459.44,for which we've never observed before 
7461.9,"in human history, right? "
7463.28,We have our Einsteins and our Feynmans and our Merzenichs 
7466.82,"and, you know, it's unclear "
7468.44,"who to put in along that line side by side, "
7470.9,"but there are some, the Michael Jordans and et cetera, "
7474.23,but we've never heard of or seen somebody 
7477.56,who can jump 
20,feet in the air. 
7480.08,"Or we've heard of people who have photographic memories, "
7484.37,but I don't know that we are aware 
7486.14,of any human being in history 
7488.06,who could memorize the entire Library of Congress 
7491.66,or all the works within the Vatican within an hour. 
7495.29,"Anyway, you get the idea. "
7497.33,What are your thoughts about manipulating neural circuitry 
7501.74,to achieve suprahuman or superhuman 
7505.1,or supraphysiological functions? 
7508.25,"Are we there, or should we even be thinking about that? "
7510.47,Is it possible given that neurons simply communicate 
7513.5,through electrical activity 
7514.52,and electrical activity can be engineered 
7516.53,outside of the brain? 
7517.94,How do you think about it? 
7519.47,"And here, we don't even have to think "
7520.49,about Neuralink in particular. 
7522.41,It's just but one example of companies 
7525.32,and people in laboratories 
7526.43,that are quite understandably considering all this. 
7530.48,"- Well, it's a really interesting time right now. "
7534.62,The science has been going on for decades. 
7537.62,The work that we've done 
7538.82,in this field that you call brain-machine interface 
7542.24,has been going on for a while. 
7544.04,And a lot of the early work 
7545.69,was just trying to restore things like arm movement 
7548.87,or having people or monkeys 
7550.61,"control a computer cursor, for example, on the screen. "
7553.55,That's been going on for decades. 
7556.31,What's been really new is that industry is now involved 
7561.437,"and some of this is now becoming commercialized, "
7563.69,and we're starting to see us now cross over to this field 
7568.22,"where it's no longer just research, "
7571.07,that we're talking about medical products that are designed 
7574.4,"to be, you know, surgically implanted in some cases. "
7577.73,"You know, there's people doing this kind of work "
7579.41,non-invasively as well that don't require surgery. 
7583.79,The specific question that you are asking about 
7586.82,is an area that we call augmentation. 
7590.0,So can you build a device 
7594.47,that essentially enhances someone's ability 
7597.53,"beyond supranormal, super memory, "
7602.24,"super communication speeds beyond speech, for example, "
7609.59,I guess superior precision athletic abilities? 
7616.1,I think that these are very serious kind of questions 
7618.47,to be asking now 
7619.79,"because, as you mentioned, the pathway so far "
7623.75,is really to focus on these medical applications. 
7627.89,I personally don't think that we've thought enough actually 
7630.68,"about what these kind of scenarios are going to look like, "
7633.89,and I don't think we've thought through 
7634.94,all the ethical implications of what this means 
7638.33,for augmentation in particular. 
7643.01,There's part of this that is not new at all. 
7646.82,Humans throughout history have been doing things 
7650.9,"to augment our function, "
7653.54,"coffee, nicotine, all kinds of things, "
7656.96,all kinds of medications that cross over 
7659.78,from medical to consumer. 
7662.15,That is everywhere. 
7664.25,So the pursuit of augmentation or performance or enhancement 
7669.11,is really not a new thing. 
7671.84,"The questions really, "
7673.52,"as they relate to neurotechnologies, for example, "
7676.61,have to do with the invasive nature. 
7679.88,"For example, if these technologies "
7681.77,"require surgery, for example, "
7683.84,to do something that is not for a medical application. 
7687.92,"Again, there, that is not exactly new territory either. "
7692.18,People do that routinely for cosmetic kind of procedures 
7695.81,"for physical appearance, not necessarily cognitive. "
7698.87,"So I do think that, provided the technology "
7703.52,"continues to emerge the way that it does, "
7706.73,"that it's going to be around the corner, "
7709.52,and it probably is not going to be in ways 
7710.9,that are super obvious. 
7712.52,"I don't think it's going to be like, "
7714.38,"can we easily memorize every fact in the world, "
7717.23,but in forms that are going to be much more incremental 
7720.26,and maybe more subtle. 
7722.9,"In many ways, we already have that now. "
7724.88,"Like, for example, you don't have to have a neural interface "
7727.25,"embedded in your brain to get information, "
7730.67,essentially access to all information in the world. 
7733.13,"You just have to have, you know, your iPhone. "
7735.8,"Whether you could do it faster through a brain interface, "
7742.25,I definitely wouldn't rule that out. 
7744.44,"But think about this, "
7745.94,that the systems that we have already 
7748.22,to speak and to communicate 
7749.78,"have evolved over, you know, thousands and millions of years "
7754.55,and they're supported by neural structures 
7757.22,that have bandwidth of millions of neurons. 
7761.42,There is no technology that exists right now 
7764.96,"that people are thinking about that are in commercial forms, "
7767.39,"certainly not even in research labs, "
7769.79,that come anywhere close 
7772.07,to what has been evolved for those natural purposes. 
7775.85,"So I'm essentially saying two sides of this, "
7779.45,"which is we're already getting into this now, "
7783.17,"this is not new territory, "
7784.85,"this topic of augmentation, both physical and cognitive, "
7788.87,we've already surpassed that. 
7789.83,That's part of what humans do in general. 
7793.76,"But we are entering this area of, like, enhanced cognition, "
7799.4,these areas that I think the technology 
7801.59,"is going to be the rate-limiting step in how far it can go, "
7804.62,and we have not had the full conversations 
7806.72,"about, number one, is this what we actually want? "
7811.25,Is this going to be good for society? 
7812.93,Who gets access to this technology? 
7815.54,These are all things 
7816.41,that are going to become real-world problems. 
7819.59,- There's certainly a lot to consider. 
7821.33,In thinking about augmentation 
7823.46,and another theme that I've yet to ask you about 
7826.85,"but I'm extremely curious about, "
7828.26,which is facial expressions. 
7830.6,Before we talk about the relationship 
7832.19,between the musculature of the face and language 
7834.92,"and the communication of emotion, "
7837.74,"I'd love for you to, if you would, touch on a little bit "
7841.07,of what you're doing with patients like Pancho 
7843.05,to move beyond somebody who's locked in 
7846.29,being able to type out words on a screen 
7848.57,with their thoughts. 
7850.73,There's a rich array of information 
7853.13,contained within the face and facial expression. 
7855.86,And while somebody like Pancho 
7857.63,"going from having to, you know, be completely locked in "
7861.02,to being able to peck out letters on a keyboard 
7863.75,to being able to just think of those letters 
7865.46,"and having them spelled out, "
7866.39,that's a tremendous set of leaps forward towards normalcy. 
7872.39,It's still far and away different 
7873.83,"than Pancho speaking with his mouth, "
7876.29,"which I think, knowing some people who are restricted, "
7880.94,"who are quadriplegic, "
7881.93,"you know, a lot of what they struggle with in the real world "
7884.09,is actually a height difference sometimes 
7885.83,because they're seated while other people are standing. 
7888.609,"We don't often think about this, "
7889.85,but to always have to look up to communicate with people 
7891.95,is a very different interface in the world. 
7894.65,"They manage quite well, of course. "
7895.88,But could you tell us what you're doing 
7898.34,in terms of merging the brain-machine interface 
7901.4,with extraction of speech signals 
7903.23,from people who are locked-in like Pancho 
7905.63,with facial expressions? 
7907.07,"- Sure, yeah. "
7908.15,"Well, like we described before, progress is being made. "
7914.63,The proof of principle is out there 
7916.31,that you can decode speech. 
7917.81,"That will continue to optimize, "
7919.25,and I'm very confident that that's going to improve 
7922.43,"very, very quickly in the coming years "
7924.92,"to the point where it's like, "
7926.6,"you know, not just a small vocabulary, "
7928.4,"but a large vocabulary and at reasonable rates, "
7932.24,at a level that's going to be really helpful. 
7934.07,I'm very optimistic about that. 
7936.65,I think it's the right time 
7937.82,to start really thinking about a broader vision 
7940.67,of what communication really is. 
7942.65,"So for example, I'm here with you in person. "
7946.61,"We could have done this virtually, probably, "
7949.1,it's pretty easy to do that. 
7950.36,"We could've recorded this really separate, "
7952.61,but there is something 
7953.6,about being able to actually see your expressions 
7956.9,and to understand other forms of communication. 
7961.46,"So another really important one is nonverbal, "
7966.5,the expressions that you're making. 
7968.27,"You know, for example, "
7969.71,if you have a quizzical look on your face 
7971.3,"if I'm saying something not clear, "
7973.28,that's a sign to me that I need to rephrase it 
7975.83,or to say it in a different way 
7977.3,"or to slow down, for example. "
7980.21,"Or if there's something that really excites you, "
7982.34,I want to continue to say more about it 
7984.11,"and talk more in detail, "
7986.45,"you know, essentially about a given thing. "
7988.91,So facial expressions actually are a really important part 
7993.35,"of the way we speak, and there's two things. "
7996.38,It's not just the expressions 
7998.21,"of, like, how you're feeling and perceiving what I'm saying, "
8001.57,but it's also seeing my mouth move 
8004.957,and your eyes actually seeing my mouth move 
8007.24,and my jaw move in a particular way 
8009.13,that actually allows you to hear those sounds better. 
8014.35,So having both the visual information 
8016.93,but also the sounds go into your brain 
8019.75,"is going to improve intelligibility, also make it more natural. "
8023.71,- And memory for what is spoken? 
8026.74,- Perhaps. 
8027.573,- So here's a call for people not just listening to podcasts 
8030.25,"but watching them and listening to them on YouTube, "
8032.74,"I suppose, if we were to sort of translate this "
8035.23,"to the real world. - Exactly, exactly. "
8037.387,And the reason why we're also very interested 
8039.76,"in this idea of not just having text on a screen, "
8044.71,but essentially a fully computer-animated face 
8049.66,like an avatar of the person's speech movements 
8053.89,and their facial expressions 
8056.14,is going to be a more complete form of expression. 
8060.82,"Now, you can imagine right now, "
8063.1,that might just be someone looking at a computer screen 
8065.59,"interpreting these signals, "
8066.88,"but I think the way things are going, "
8069.76,"in the next couple of years, "
8071.17,"a lot more of our social interactions, more than even now, "
8074.95,are going to move into this digital virtual space. 
8077.95,"And, of course, most people are thinking "
8080.32,"about what that means for most consumers, "
8083.38,but it also has really important implications 
8085.36,"for people who are disabled, right, "
8087.13,and how are they going to participate in that. 
8090.4,"And so we are thinking really about, "
8092.14,"for people like Pancho and other people who are paralyzed, "
8095.92,what other forms of BCI can we do 
8100.66,in order to help improve their ability to communicate? 
8103.0,"So one is essentially building out more holistic avatars, "
8106.99,"you know, things that can essentially decode, "
8111.52,"you know, essentially their expressions "
8114.13,or the movements associated with their mouth and jaw 
8118.15,when they actually speak to improve that communication. 
8121.54,- So do you envision a time not too long from now 
8124.3,"where instead of tweeting out something in text, "
8126.94,"my avatar will, "
8128.32,"I'll type it out, but my avatar will just say it, "
8131.17,it'll be an image of my avatar saying whatever it is 
8134.23,I happen to be tweeting at that moment. 
8135.615,"- That's what we're working on, yeah. "
8136.66,So I don't think that... 
8138.76,"That is going to happen and it's going to happen soon, "
8140.98,and there's a lot of progress in that. 
8143.293,"And, again, we're just trying to enrich the field, "
8148.69,"you know, of communication expression "
8151.57,to make it more normal. 
8152.737,And we actually think that having that kind of avatar 
8156.76,is a way of getting feedback to people learning how to speak 
8159.64,"through a speech neuroprosthetic, "
8162.19,"that's the device that we call, "
8163.3,"it's a speech neuroprosthetic, "
8165.4,that that is going to be the way that can help people 
8168.31,learn how to do it the quickest. 
8169.9,"Not necessarily, like, trying to say words "
8171.88,"and having it come on a screen, "
8173.68,"but actually have people embody, "
8176.47,feel like it's part of themselves 
8178.39,or that they are directly controlling 
8181.09,that illustration or animation. 
8184.0,- This idea of an avatar 
8186.88,speaking out what we would otherwise write 
8190.51,is fascinating to me. 
8191.41,"On Instagram, I post videos, I don't filter them, "
8195.55,but I know there's a lot of discussion nowadays 
8198.04,about people using filters to make their skin look different 
8201.16,"or the lighting look different, "
8202.3,"a lot of filtering and also the use of captions, "
8204.97,so that essentially what you end up with 
8206.32,is somewhere between an actual raw video of what was spoken 
8211.15,and an avatar version of it. 
8212.6,"- Yeah. - I mean, if the mismatch "
8214.27,between what's spoken and what's in the caption 
8215.92,"is too dramatic, then it doesn't quite work. "
8218.77,"But I watch these carefully when people use captions, "
8222.01,and oftentimes there's a smoothing 
8224.56,of what was said into the captions 
8225.82,so it seems much more succinct and accurate. 
8228.19,"Oftentimes, the reverse is also true "
8230.23,where the caption is inaccurate 
8231.61,and then it creates this kind of jarring mismatch. 
8234.61,"In any case, I think this aspect in the clinical realm "
8237.46,of using an avatar to allow people like Pancho 
8239.77,to essentially be a face 
8241.33,that communicates through spoken language 
8243.43,from an avatar that looks like them 
8245.5,"is fascinating and indeed important, "
8248.41,and I think how avatars emerge in social spaces 
8252.34,is going to be really fascinating. 
8254.71,I get a lot of questions about stutter. 
8257.14,"I think that for people who have a stutter, "
8259.38,it is itself anxiety-provoking. 
8263.26,Is stutter related to anxiety? 
8265.9,"If one has a stutter, what can they do? "
8270.85,Does stutter reflect some underlying neurologic phenomenon 
8275.56,that might distinguish 
8277.48,between one kind of stutter and another? 
8279.79,What can people with stutter do 
8281.23,if they'd like to relieve their stutter? 
8282.7,"- Yeah, great question. "
8285.7,Stutter is a condition 
8288.58,where the words can't come out fluently. 
8291.61,"So you have all the ideas, you've got the language intact. "
8294.64,"You know, remember, we talked about this distinction "
8296.2,between language and speech. 
8298.27,"Stuttering is a problem of speech, right? "
8300.28,"So the ideas, the meanings, the grammar, it's all there, "
8304.51,and people stutter 
8305.44,but they can't get the words out fluently. 
8308.32,"So that's a speech condition, "
8310.96,"and, in particular, it's a condition "
8312.85,"that affects articulation, "
8315.91,specifically about controlling the production of words 
8320.17,in this really coordinated kind of movements 
8322.42,that have to happen in the vocal tract 
8324.46,to produce fluent speech. 
8327.52,And stuttering is a condition 
8330.88,"where people have a predisposition to it, "
8335.71,"so there is an aspect of stuttering, "
8338.65,"you are a stutterer or you're not a stutterer, right? "
8342.25,"But people who stutter don't stutter all the time either, "
8346.12,so you could be a stutterer 
8347.38,who stutters at some times but not others. 
8351.22,"And, really, the main link between stuttering and anxiety "
8355.51,is that anxiety can provoke it and make it worse. 
8360.64,"That's certainly true, "
8363.16,but it's not necessarily caused by anxiety. 
8366.69,"It can essentially trigger it or make it worse, "
8370.72,"but it's not the cause of it, per se. "
8373.39,"So the cause of it is still really not clear, "
8376.48,but it does have to do with these kind of brain functions 
8380.23,"that we've been talking about earlier, "
8382.33,"which is that in order to produce normal fluent speech, "
8388.06,we're not even conscious of what is going on 
8390.73,"in our mouths, in our larynx. "
8393.1,"We're not conscious, "
8393.933,"and if we were, we would not be able to speak "
8395.59,"because it's too complex, it's too precise. "
8398.83,It's something that we have really developed 
8402.82,"the abilities to do, and we do it naturally, right? "
8404.95,It's part of our programming 
8406.09,"and part of what we learn inherently, "
8408.67,"you know, just through exposure. "
8411.4,So stuttering is essentially a breakdown 
8416.89,at certain times 
8419.14,in that machinery being able to work 
8421.27,in a really coordinated way. 
8423.85,"You can think about, you know, the operations of these areas "
8426.61,that are controlling the vocal tract. 
8428.5,Let's say speech is like a symphony. 
8430.06,"In order for it to come out normally, "
8431.77,"you've got to have not just one part, the larynx, "
8435.76,"but the lips, the jaw. "
8437.02,They can't be doing their own thing. 
8439.03,"They have to be very, very precisely activated "
8443.89,"and very, very precisely controlled "
8445.51,in a way to actually create words. 
8448.143,"And so in stuttering, "
8449.17,there's a breakdown of that coordination. 
8451.66,"- If somebody has a stutter, "
8453.13,is it better to address that early in life 
8455.92,when there's still neuroplasticity that is very robust? 
8459.76,"And if so, what's the typical route for treatment? "
8462.4,I have to imagine it's not brain surgery typically. 
8465.82,I'm guessing there are speech therapists 
8467.32,"that people can talk to, "
8470.961,and they can help them work out where they're getting stuck 
8474.13,and the relationship to anxiety. 
8475.9,"- Yeah, exactly. "
8476.733,"I mean, part of it is about that anxiety, "
8479.08,but a lot of it really has to do with therapy 
8483.91,to sort of like work through 
8486.1,and think of tricks basically sometimes to create conditions 
8490.54,where you can actually get the words to come out. 
8493.33,Some forms of stuttering are really initiation problems. 
8496.66,Just getting started itself is very hard. 
8499.39,"You want to start with initial vowel or consonant, "
8503.29,but it won't emit. 
8505.78,And so a lot of the therapy is really just focusing 
8509.53,"on, like, how do you create the conditions, "
8512.59,"you know, for that to happen? "
8514.69,There's another aspect to it that I find very interesting 
8517.57,"is that the feedback, "
8519.7,"essentially, what we hear ourselves say, for example, "
8525.01,"and every time that I say a word, "
8528.07,"I'm also hearing what I'm saying, "
8529.45,so that's what we call auditory feedback. 
8532.0,"That turns out to be very important, "
8533.68,"and sometimes when you change that, "
8535.84,it can actually change the amount someone stutters 
8538.24,for better or for worse. 
8539.92,And it's giving us a clue that the brain 
8543.82,"is not just focused on sending the commands out, "
8547.3,but it's also possibly interacting 
8549.58,"with the part that is hearing the sounds, "
8552.07,and there's something might be going on in that connection 
8554.9,that breaks down when stuttering occurs. 
8557.65,So there are individuals that are stutterers 
8561.13,but they don't stutter all the time. 
8563.2,"In those instances, "
8564.22,there's something happening in those particular moments 
8567.46,"where this very, very precise coordination "
8571.0,needs to happen in the brain 
8572.65,in order to get the words out fluently. 
8574.99,- We've talked a little bit about caffeine 
8576.55,and why you avoid it. 
8578.77,"Because your work requires such precision and calm, "
8581.77,"and, frankly, to me, "
8583.57,"it seems like you're running a lot of operations, "
8586.03,"no pun intended, in parallel when you're doing surgery, "
8589.06,"not just thinking about where to direct the instruments, "
8591.13,but also thinking like a chess player 
8593.5,several steps down the line 
8594.91,"what could happen, what if, if-then type thinking. "
8598.12,What are some of the other practices and tools that you use 
8601.3,to put yourself into state for optimal neurosurgery 
8605.2,"or for, you know, thinking about scientific problems "
8608.77,for that matter? 
8609.73,"We keep threatening to go running together, "
8611.38,"but I know you run, correct? "
8613.9,- Yeah. 
8615.1,- Do you find running to be an essential part 
8617.5,of your state regulation? 
8620.32,"- Absolutely, yeah. "
8621.94,"So for me, most exercise that I do, "
8625.81,I really don't do for physical reasons. 
8628.18,I do it for mental reasons. 
8630.82,"I can tell, for example, "
8632.86,"if I don't go on a run or a swim just after a day or two, "
8638.17,"and it can have translation, "
8639.61,"for example, in the way I feel in the operating room "
8642.4,or even the way I interact with other people. 
8644.8,So there's no question 
8646.57,"that, you know, the mind and body are deeply connected, "
8649.87,"and for me personally, "
8651.76,"being able to have opportunity to disconnect for a while, "
8655.81,"it turns out to be really, really important. "
8658.45,"Now, the operating room, for me, is another space, "
8664.12,"kind of like running or swimming, "
8666.43,where I'm disconnected from the rest of the world. 
8670.21,I don't bring my cell phone into the operating room. 
8674.32,I'm disconnected from the external world 
8677.11,"for that time that I'm in the surgery, "
8679.33,and all I am doing is just focusing. 
8681.88,"Now, that doesn't mean that I'm having complex thoughts "
8684.97,or doing something very complicated. 
8687.31,"Sometimes it is like that, but it's not always like that. "
8691.72,There are things that we do in surgery 
8693.49,"that are, like, routine and rote "
8697.42,and are from muscle memory. 
8699.07,"So, for example, suturing skin "
8701.17,or doing certain kinds of dissection 
8704.23,"or drilling part of the bone, for example, "
8706.09,these are all things that become very rote after a time. 
8709.27,"So, for me, even being in the operating room "
8712.27,actually can sometimes fulfill that purpose. 
8714.28,So I really look forward to being in the operating room 
8718.6,because that intense focus 
8722.56,allows me to sort of disconnect 
8724.33,"from all the other things that I'm worrying about, "
8726.22,"you know, that are happening out in the outside world. "
8730.12,"You know, we all have those kind of things that happen, "
8732.31,and I'm certainly no exception to that. 
8735.4,"But, strangely, the operating room, for me, is a sanctuary. "
8740.02,I love being there 
8741.94,because we have some control over the environment. 
8748.51,"I know what is there, I know the anatomy of the brain, "
8754.21,my motions are going through routines. 
8757.63,"And so for me, that's not actually very different "
8760.57,than going on a run 
8761.77,"and letting my, you know, legs move in specific ways. "
8765.88,It's just the same thing for my hands. 
8768.52,"- Do you listen to music or audiobooks when you run, "
8771.28,or are you divorced from technology when you run? 
8774.61,"- Well, music helps me, like, just stay motivated "
8777.94,and distracted from being out of breath and other things. 
8781.57,"And for me, it's a way to just catch up "
8783.85,"with, like, the world. "
8785.41,"So sometimes I do, but I do notice "
8788.08,"that, like, I don't run as well, for example. "
8790.63,"In the operating room, it's a little different. "
8792.67,"You know, different surgeons have preferences. "
8795.52,I'm more of the camp 
8798.82,where I don't like any distraction whatsoever. 
8801.22,I like people to be able to hear the words that I'm saying 
8804.31,without having background noise. 
8809.29,I don't really think about relying on music or other things 
8812.17,to try to put me in a state of mind. 
8814.3,"You know, I think just being there alone "
8817.15,"and just, you know, trying to treat it the way it is, "
8820.33,it's a sacred moment where someone's life 
8823.27,"is really directly under your hands, "
8826.21,"That enough kind of focuses me very quickly, "
8829.27,and I like that. 
8831.19,It really detaches me from a lot of the things 
8833.47,"that are preoccupying me, "
8835.3,"and for those couple of hours that we have a surgery, "
8838.87,we're just focused on one thing only. 
8841.18,- That's fantastic. 
8842.41,"Again, I think of, in the range of brain explorers, "
8845.74,"the neurosurgeons, those of your profession, "
8848.95,"are, to me, like the astronauts of neuroscience "
8851.92,because they're really going 
8853.12,"to the farthest reaches possible, "
8855.37,and they're testing and probing 
8856.75,and really at the front edge of discovering from the species 
8860.65,"that we arguably care about the most, which is humans. "
8865.21,"Eddie, I have to say, "
8868.18,from the first time we became friends 
38,years ago... 
8872.59,- Something like that. 
8873.423,- Something like that. 
8875.38,"I'm almost reluctant to say, "
8877.63,so I only reveal it in part that Eddie and I became friends 
8880.99,"because both he and I shared a love of birds, "
8885.04,and we had a club at our school 
8887.98,"of which there were only two members, Eddie and I. "
8891.1,- Small club. 
8891.933,- Small club. 
8892.78,"There was one honorary member, "
8894.28,and there were certain requirements for being in this club 
8896.38,that we won't reveal. 
8897.37,"We took a pact of secrecy, "
8899.05,and we're going to obey that pact of secrecy. 
8901.96,"But to be sitting here with you today, "
8904.81,"for me, is a absolute thrill, "
8908.53,not just because we've been friends for that long 
8910.21,or that we got reacquainted 
8911.53,"through literally the halls of medicine and science, "
8914.08,but because I really do see what you're doing 
8917.29,"as really representing that front, absolute cutting edge "
8923.02,of exploration and application. 
8925.03,"I mean, the story of Pancho is but one of your many patients "
8928.36,that has derived tremendous benefit from your work. 
8932.35,"And now as the chair of a department, "
8933.7,"you, of course, work alongside individuals "
8938.41,who are also doing incredible work 
8939.61,"in the spinal cord, et cetera. "
8941.77,"So on behalf of myself and everyone listening, "
8944.41,I just really want to thank you for joining us today 
8947.32,to share this information. 
8948.64,We will certainly have you back 
8949.96,because there's an entire list of other questions 
8952.54,"we didn't have time to get to, "
8954.13,"but also just for the work you do, it's truly spectacular. "
8958.03,"- Andrew, thanks so much. "
8960.91,"You know, I'm very humbled basically by what you just said, "
8963.85,and I feel that it's really an extraordinary honor actually 
8968.44,"and privilege, you know, to be here with you "
8970.27,and reconnect and talk about all these ideas. 
8973.78,"It's probably not random, "
8975.46,"you know, that we ended up in similar spots and interests. "
8979.54,"I think when we were kids, "
8980.65,"you know, it starts with some deep interests "
8983.83,"and kind of nerding out on topics, "
8987.37,"and it's probably not a coincidence, "
8990.52,"you know, that we have such deep interest in this work now. "
8994.84,I just feel really lucky to be able to do what I do. 
8997.39,"It's fun every day, almost every day, "
9000.93,be able to go to work and take care of folks 
9003.48,"and learn at the same time and then just close the loop, "
9006.54,"you know, how do we apply the knowledge "
9008.25,that we learn one day to someone who comes in next week? 
9011.67,It's really fun. 
9012.6,"And we don't know everything, we're not even close to it, "
9017.19,"but the journey to figure this out, "
9021.18,it's really extraordinary. 
9022.59,"I mean, it's like you said, "
9027.51,it's exploring new lands. 
9029.67,Literally in the operating room 
9031.5,when I'm looking at the exposed cortex trying to understand 
9035.61,is it safe to walk down this part of the cortical landscape 
9040.65,or this other trail? 
9042.57,"You know, which one is going to be the one "
9044.46,that is going to be safe 
9045.6,versus the other that results in paralysis 
9048.09,and inability to talk? 
9050.85,"Well, maybe I shouldn't call it fun, "
9052.2,"but it's very important, too, "
9056.04,in addition to being really intellectually important 
9058.41,for how we understand how the brain works. 
9060.72,"And so, yeah, I feel just really lucky "
9062.43,to be in that opportunity. 
9063.9,- And we're lucky to have you 
9065.34,"being one of the people doing it, so thank you ever so much. "
9068.43,- Thanks.
