0.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the,"Huberman Lab podcast,"
2.25,where we discuss science
and,science-based tools
4.92,for everyday life.
5.7,[MUSIC PLAYING]
9.16,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
and,I'm a professor
11.05,of neurobiology
and,ophthalmology
13.18,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.89,"Today, my guest is"
Dr.,Chris Palmer.
17.32,Dr. Chris Palmer
is,a medical doctor
19.33,specializing in psychiatry
at,Harvard Medical School.
22.48,He is the world expert
in,the relationship
24.88,between metabolic disorders
and,psychiatric disorders.
28.287,He treats a variety of
different,"conditions,"
30.12,"including psychosis, including"
"schizophrenia,",as well
33.31,as attention deficit
hyperactivity,
35.11,"disorder, obsessive compulsive"
"disorder,","anxiety disorders,"
38.9,and depression among others.
41.21,He is best known
for,understanding
42.97,the relationship
between,how metabolism
45.41,and these various disorders
of,the mind interact.
47.98,"And indeed, today,"
he,describes not
50.02,only his own fascinating journey
into,the field of psychiatry
53.38,but also his clinical
and,research experience
56.47,using diet that is
different,forms of nutrition
59.59,in order to treat various
psychiatric,disorders.
62.45,He describes some
remarkable,case studies
65.14,of individuals and
groups,of people
67.39,who have achieved tremendous
relief,from the types
70.24,of psychiatric
disorders,that I just
71.98,"mentioned a few moments ago, as"
well,as new and emerging themes
76.33,as to how metabolism
and,the mind
78.4,interact to control
things,like obesity.
81.04,"Indeed, he raises the"
hypothesis,"that perhaps obesity,"
84.34,"in many cases, is the"
consequence,of a brain
86.98,dysfunction as opposed
to,the consequence
89.275,of a metabolic dysfunction
that,then impacts the brain.
92.41,"During today's episode,"
he,shares with us
94.87,his overriding hypotheses
about,the critical roles
97.93,that mitochondrial function
and,dysfunction play
101.38,in mental health
and,"mental illness,"
103.33,and how various particular
types,of diets--
106.15,ranging from the
ketogenic,diet to modified
108.76,ketogenic diet and
even,just slight
110.8,adjustments in
carbohydrate,intake--
112.63,can be used in order to
change,mitochondrial function
116.23,and bring relief for various
psychiatric,illnesses.
119.38,He also highlights the
essential,and important theme
122.44,"that various diet interventions,"
including,"the ketogenic diet,"
126.52,were not first developed
for,sake of weight loss
129.009,but rather were
developed,as treatments
131.2,"for neurologic conditions,"
such,as epilepsy.
133.51,"Today, he shares"
with,us how the foods
135.31,that we eat alone and in
"combination,",and how fasting--
139.15,both intermittent fasting
and,more lengthy fasts--
142.24,can interact with the way
that,our brain functions
144.85,to strongly control the way
that,"we think, feel, and behave."
148.69,What's wonderful is that
Dr.,Palmer not only explains
151.24,the science and his
clinical,"expertise,"
153.2,but also points to various
actionable,measures
155.56,that people can take in order
to,improve their mental health.
158.83,I'd like to mention
that,Dr. Palmer is also
160.81,the author of a
terrific,new book.
162.64,The title is Brain Energy:
A,Revolutionary Breakthrough
165.88,in Understanding Mental
Health,and Improving
167.8,"Treatment for Anxiety,"
"Depression,","OCD, PTSD and More."
172.57,"I've read the book, and"
it,is a terrific read.
175.12,I came away from this book with
a,much evolved understanding
178.96,of how the various psychiatric
disorders,that I just
181.36,"described, as well as"
"ADHD,",emerge in people.
184.48,And it has completely
revised,my understanding
186.82,about the possible origins of
various,psychiatric disorders
189.7,and the best ways to
treat,"them, including"
192.04,both with medications but also
with,nutritional approaches.
196.06,If you'd like to learn
more,about Dr. Palmer's
197.98,"work and the book, please"
go,to chrispalmermd.com.
202.21,We also provide
links,to the book
203.95,and to his website in
our,show note captions.
206.26,"Before we begin, I'd"
like,to emphasize
208.06,that this podcast is separate
from,my teaching and research
210.52,roles at Stanford.
211.72,"It is, however, part"
of,my desire and effort
213.76,to bring zero cost to consumer
information,about science
216.22,and science-related tools
for,the general public.
218.86,In keeping with
that,"theme, I'd like"
220.36,to thank the sponsors
of,today's podcast.
222.8,Our first sponsor is Thesis.
224.95,Thesis makes custom nootropics.
227.14,And as I've said many times
before,"on this podcast,"
229.96,I am not a fan of
the,"word ""nootropics"""
232.21,because it means smart drugs.
234.16,"And frankly, there are no"
specific,neural circuits
236.83,in the brain or body for
"being,","quote unquote, ""smart."""
239.83,Thesis understands this.
241.36,And they've developed
custom,nootropics
243.37,that are designed
to,bring your brain
244.93,and body into the state
that's,ideal for what
247.18,you need to accomplish.
248.812,They use the highest
quality,"ingredients,"
250.52,things like
"phosphatidylserine,","alpha GPC,"
253.005,many ingredients
that,I've talked
254.38,about before on this podcast
and,that I happen to use myself.
257.529,I've been using Thesis
for,over a year now.
259.39,And I can confidently
say,that their nootropics
261.348,have been a game changer.
262.66,"For me, I like their"
nootropic,for clarity.
265.63,I use that before
cognitive,work often.
267.85,And I like their
nootropic,"for energy,"
269.987,and I often use that
before,workouts--
271.57,"in particular, workouts"
that,are especially intense.
274.905,To get your own personalized
nootropic,"starter kit,"
277.03,go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.,
279.58,Take their 3-minute
"quiz,",and Thesis
281.08,will send you four
different,formulas
282.67,to try in your first month.

290.5,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Eight Sleep.
293.44,Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers,"with cooling, heating,"
296.2,and sleep tracking capacity.
298.21,I've talked many
times,on this podcast
300.16,about the critical relationship
between,sleep and body
302.83,temperature.
303.82,"That is, in order to fall"
asleep,and stay deeply asleep
306.94,"throughout the night,"
our,body temperature
308.69,needs to drop by
about,1 to 3 degrees.
311.06,"And conversely, when we"
wake,"up in the morning,"
313.73,"that is, in large part,"
because,of our body heating up
317.03,by 1 to 3 degrees.
318.637,"Now, people have different"
core,body temperatures.
320.72,And they tend to run colder or
hotter,throughout the night.
323.24,Eight Sleep allows you
to,adjust the temperature
325.263,of your sleeping
environment,so that you
326.93,have the optimal temperature
that,gets you the best night's
329.48,sleep.
330.02,I started sleeping on
an,Eight Sleep mattress
331.895,cover about eight months
"ago,",and it has completely
334.37,transformed my sleep.
335.51,I sleep so much deeper.
337.34,I wake up far less during the
middle,"of the night, if at all."
340.23,And I wake up feeling far
better,than I ever have even
343.28,after the same amount of sleep.

354.345,Eight Sleep currently
ships,"in the USA,"
355.97,"Canada, United Kingdom,"
select,"countries in the EU,"
359.09,and Australia.
360.29,"Again, that's"
eightsleep.com/huberman.,
362.96,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by ROKA.
365.42,ROKA makes eyeglasses
and,sunglasses
367.67,that are of the absolute
highest,quality.
369.8,The company was founded by
two,All-American swimmers
371.99,from Stanford.
372.89,And everything about ROKA
eyeglasses,and sunglasses
375.41,were designed with
performance,in mind.
377.45,I've spent a lifetime working on
the,"biology, the visual system."
380.37,And I can tell you that
your,visual system has
381.86,to contend with an enormous
number,of challenges in order
384.38,for you to see clearly--
385.4,"for instance, when you move from"
a,sunny area to a shady area
388.01,"and back again, whether or not"
you're,looking at something up
390.17,close or often to the distance.
391.73,ROKA understands the
biology,of the visual system
394.19,and has designed their
eyeglasses,and sunglasses
396.38,accordingly so that you always
see,with perfect clarity.
399.17,ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses,were initially
401.33,designed for activities
such,as running and cycling.
404.577,"And indeed, they are"
very,lightweight.
406.16,Most of the time I
can't,even remember
407.57,that they're on my face.
408.5,They're so lightweight.
409.458,But the important thing to
know,about ROKA eyeglasses
411.68,and sunglasses is
that,while they
413.33,can be used during
sports,"activities,"
415.82,they also have a
terrific,aesthetic.
417.89,And they can be used just as
well,for wearing to work or out
421.49,"to dinner, et cetera."
422.69,If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses,"and sunglasses,"

435.95,"And now, for my discussion"
with,Dr. Chris Palmer.
439.34,"Chris, Dr. Palmer, thank"
you,for being here.
441.562,"CHRIS PALMER: Thank you,"
"Andrew,",for having me.
443.52,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have a
lot,of questions for you.
445.68,And I'm really excited
about,this topic
447.305,because I think most people
know,what mental illness is--
450.98,or they have some
idea,what that is.
452.51,Most people have some
idea,what nutrition is.
455.39,Fewer people certainly
know,how closely
459.515,those things can interact.
462.45,And I think everybody is
familiar,with the feeling
466.37,of a food or the
ingestion,of a food
468.68,making them feel good
in,the short term.
471.203,When we eat a food that
tastes,delicious to us
473.12,or that we associate
with,"something nice,"
475.31,then we feel good
mentally,and physically.
478.1,"Whereas, when we eat"
something,that gives us
480.267,food poisoning or maybe even
something,that just doesn't
482.6,taste that great or
that,we associate
484.25,"with a bad experience, we feel"
less,good in the short term.
487.83,But I believe that very
few,people understand
492.21,or are familiar with
the,fact that nutrition
496.08,and our mental health interact
in,"this very intimate, maybe"
500.55,"even causal, way and that"
is,something that occurs
504.38,over long periods of time.
505.79,"Meaning, what I ate yesterday"
or,"the day before, maybe"
508.31,"even 10 years ago, could"
be,impacting the way
511.37,that my brain and body
are,making me feel now.
514.26,"So if you would, I'd love"
for,you to just tell us
516.679,about a little bit
of,"the history,"
519.02,"in particular, your"
history,with exploring
521.419,the relationship between
nutrition,and mental health.
524.6,And then we can dive into
some,of the more particulars
528.14,of ketogenic diets
versus,"other diets,"
530.63,and some of the truly
miraculous,findings
533.9,that you and others
are,coming up
536.6,with based on real patients
and,real experiences of people
541.43,who suffer and then find relief
by,altering their nutrition.
544.793,CHRIS PALMER: Sure.
548.69,This story really starts
with,my own personal story.
551.88,And I don't need to
go,into great detail.
556.31,"But to set the stage,"
when,"I was a kid,"
560.16,I definitely had mental
"illness,",started with OCD.
565.31,A series of events
happened,in my family.
567.48,My mother had a horrible
kind,"of psychotic break,"
571.76,and all sorts of adverse
childhood,events for me.
575.96,She and I were actually
homeless,together for a while.
580.64,I went on to have subsequent
"depression,","suicidality,"
584.99,all sorts of things.
586.88,"But somehow or another, I"
pulled,myself together and got
590.755,through medical
school--,actually
592.13,did quite well in
medical,"school,"
594.05,got an award for being
one,"of the top students,"
597.74,and then was doing my internship
and,residency at Harvard.
604.47,And at that point in
"time,",I was diagnosed
607.615,with metabolic syndrome.
610.43,So I had high blood
"pressure,","horrible lipids,"
614.38,and pre-diabetes.
615.97,And I was doing everything
right,supposedly.
618.73,"I was on a low-fat diet, and"
I,was exercising regularly.
623.38,And year after
"year,",my doctor kept
625.18,telling me diet and exercise.
627.53,"I kept asking him, what diet?"
628.93,What exercise?
630.49,I was doing everything
he,kept telling me to do.
633.37,Everything was getting worse.
634.6,My blood pressure
kept,going higher.
638.89,"And at some point,"
he,"kind of said,"
641.44,you're going to have
to,go on medication.
643.942,I need to put you on something
for,"your pre-diabetes,"
646.15,"something for your cholesterol,"
and,something for your blood
648.65,pressure.
649.64,So three pills out of the gate.
651.91,"And I'm like, I'm"
only,in my 20s.
653.38,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Were,you overweight?
654.4,CHRIS PALMER: No.
655.39,"Technically, no."
656.62,"I had a gut, so that's a sign of"
insulin,"resistance, I know now."
662.8,I didn't know it then.
667.5,And he actually kind of leaned
in,"at one point and said,"
670.785,do your parents have diabetes?
674.16,Yeah.
674.82,Do your parents have
high,blood pressure?
676.528,Yeah.
677.853,Are your parents overweight?
679.02,Yeah.
680.19,"Oh, I'm really"
"sorry,",it's genetic.
683.88,"Basically, you're screwed."
685.35,It's your genes.
686.58,You're just going to have to
bite,the bullet and take meds.
690.42,"And as a physician, I"
knew,what that meant.
693.88,I knew that I'm in my
"20s,",if I'm already
696.78,on three meds for
metabolic,"syndrome,"
699.48,I'm going to be screwed
by,the time I'm 40 or 50.
702.032,And I'm probably going to
be,having heart attacks.
706.86,And I'd heard through
the,rumor mill
709.35,that the Atkins
diet,could somehow
713.13,help people improve their
cholesterol,in pre-diabetes.
718.62,I actually didn't
really,believe it.
720.13,I was highly skeptical.
721.44,And I believed everything I
was,taught in medical school.
725.67,Why would my
professors,lie to me?
727.62,They knew what they
were,talking about.
729.3,Low-fat diet was
the,thing to do.
731.88,And the Atkins diet was
clearly,dangerous and reckless.
736.95,But I had been trying the
medical,"dogma for years,"
740.34,and it wasn't working for me.
742.59,And so for whatever
"reason,",I decided
744.69,this is going to be my last
attempt,at something different.
749.22,And then I'll just bite
the,bullet and go on meds.
752.79,So I tried the Atkins diet.
755.76,I did my own special
version,of it.
757.65,I still avoided red meat because
I,was terrified of red meat.
762.155,I tried to do a healthy
"version,",which it's probably
765.45,more like the South Beach diet.
767.73,This was before the South
Beach,Diet was invented.
770.22,"But within three months,"
my,metabolic syndrome
773.94,was completely gone.
775.72,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So blood
pressure,"normalized,"
778.23,lipids normalized.
779.67,Did your weight change?
780.975,You mentioned that you
were,of healthy weight
782.85,but that you had a
bit,of abdominal--
784.62,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
785.37,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --fat.
786.0,CHRIS PALMER: I lost
the,abdominal fat.
787.71,I probably lost about 10
pounds,through this process.
792.93,But everything got normal.
795.31,And when I went back to
my,"doctor, he was shocked."
797.7,"He actually said, what"
the,hell are you doing?
799.68,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
During,the time before
801.305,"you switched to this new diet,"
how,"was your mental health,"
804.603,if you don't mind me asking?
805.77,Because it sound like
you're,very clear that there
808.41,was metabolic
syndrome,or you were
810.24,headed towards more
severe,metabolic syndrome.
812.25,You mentioned OCD.
814.02,I actually am
familiar,with this.
815.61,"As a kid, I had a low level"
kind,of Tourette's grunt.
819.12,"And probably me, obsessive"
still,to some extent--
823.2,although not full-blown
clinically,"diagnosed OCD,"
826.02,so I can relate somewhat.
828.45,"If you're willing,"
what,was the context
831.15,of all that before and after
this,nutritional switch?
836.56,CHRIS PALMER: So before
the,"nutritional switch,"
840.37,I was still struggling with
low,grade depression and OCD.
851.24,"Again, it wasn't"
necessarily,interfering
853.88,with my ability to function
because,I was functioning
856.115,at a high level.
858.32,Anybody looking from the
"outside,",you're a top student.
861.265,You just got into one of
the,most competitive--
863.51,"actually, at that point, it was"
the,most competitive residency
866.42,program in the country
for,psychiatry.
869.21,So they would have looked
at,"me and said, you're fine."
871.62,But I wasn't.
872.93,I was actually on medications.
874.59,I was trying
different,"medications,"
876.74,trying to figure out
how,"to feel better,"
879.77,"how to stop obsessing so much,"
how,to not be so depressed.
884.51,And I found that
those,"medications,"
889.97,they actually came with
more,side effects for me
892.47,than benefits.
894.42,I was on Prozac for a long time.
896.31,It totally messed up my sleep.
898.482,And then the
psychiatrist,"was like,"
899.94,you need pills to
help,you sleep now.
902.28,And I'm-- I just--
903.11,"I'm like, that doesn't--"
904.68,that's not really resonating
very,well with me.
907.05,And I'm now a psychiatrist.
908.52,I'm in my psychiatry residency.
910.32,"And I'm thinking, you know what?"
912.3,That's just not
sitting,well with me
915.03,that you're going to prescribe
more,and more meds for all
917.73,the side effects
that,you're causing.
920.207,"And yet at the same time,"
I,wanted to feel better.
922.29,And I was learning
chemical,imbalances.
925.41,This is what we do to get
rid,of depression and OCD.
928.44,You're supposed to
take,your pills.
929.91,And so I was taking my pills.
931.8,I was in psychotherapy.
933.24,I had been in psychotherapy
on,and off for years.
937.62,I had received much
more,intensive treatment
939.63,when I was younger.
940.77,And that was essentially
worthless,for me.
944.16,It actually probably just caused
harm,at the end of the day.
947.94,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Psychoanalysis?
951.068,CHRIS PALMER: Various
psychotherapies--,not
952.86,psychoanalysis per
"se,",but some of them
955.05,were psychoanalytically-oriented
psychotherapies.,
958.77,I was actually
hospitalized,at one point.
962.046,I had been put on lithium
and,"imipramine, which"
966.57,"is a tricyclic antidepressant,"
and,other things.
970.8,And they were actually horrible.
973.86,They were horrible.
974.76,They did nothing
beneficial,for me.
978.27,I gave them a decent
amount,of time to work.
981.0,I really wanted to feel better.
985.3,So at the time that
I,"tried this diet,"
988.92,I certainly wasn't
impaired,in the same way.
991.47,I wasn't struggling that much.
993.36,But I was-- still have
these,"low grade symptoms,"
996.0,was trying to feel better.
998.28,And the thing that was
the,"most striking to me,"
1003.19,after doing the diet
for,"three months,"
1005.68,was not the fact that my
metabolic,syndrome was gone.
1008.72,"That was my goal, and it"
was,a seemingly miraculous
1014.17,achievement because I
got,rid of everything
1017.35,with one dietary change.
1019.69,But the thing that I noticed
was,dramatic improvement
1022.9,"in my mood, energy,"
"concentration,",and sleep.
1027.55,I-- for the first
time,"in my life,"
1030.89,I started waking up
before,my alarm went off
1033.46,and feeling rested.
1035.349,That never happened
to,me before.
1038.155,I was meticulous about
planning,when my alarm went off
1042.339,and how many times I could
push,the snooze button in order
1046.45,to be on time for
wherever,"I needed to be,"
1049.55,whether it was school or
the,hospital or whatever.
1054.01,I had it.
1055.25,I had this good system.
1056.29,I was never late for anything.
1058.3,But that was shocking to
"me,",that I felt so good.
1066.24,And one of the things that I've
often,"said to people, prior"
1070.08,"to the diet, I always felt"
like,there are two types
1073.5,of people in the world.
1074.8,"There are ""haves"""
and,"""have-nots."""
1076.6,There are these
"happy,","peppy people,"
1079.26,"who just are so positive,"
and,they've got energy.
1083.07,And they have the
"saying,",they like
1085.38,to work hard and play hard.
1088.83,And I always understood
working,hard.
1091.14,I totally got that because
I,was a hard worker
1093.39,and I understood the
value,of hard work.
1095.4,And you got to do something
useful,with yourself.
1099.39,But I never understood who
the,"hell wants to play hard,"
1103.86,like who's got energy for that?
1106.03,Aren't you tired
from,working so hard?
1108.09,How on Earth do these
people,have energy
1111.36,to go and play hard?
1114.43,And I assumed that
they,were just part
1117.13,"of the ""haves"" in the world."
1119.95,And they were just
lucky,and privileged.
1122.26,They either had good
genetics,or maybe they
1125.23,had good childhoods
or,good parents
1128.26,or something-- something
that,I didn't have.
1130.435,ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
kids,with genuine smiles
1132.31,in the yearbooks.
1133.18,"CHRIS PALMER: Yes, exactly."
1134.425,ANDREW HUBERMAN: [LAUGHS]
1135.04,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
1135.79,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Whereas,",the rest--
1138.19,"and by the way, I"
really,appreciate
1140.17,you sharing some of
your,personal story
1142.48,because I think it is
very,important for people
1146.02,to hear and understand
that,"people like yourself,"
1149.44,who are extremely high
functioning,"and accomplished,"
1152.23,that the road was--
1155.71,from everything I'm hearing
and,understanding-- very choppy
1159.25,"internally at times,"
and,that you've overcome
1161.95,a lot in order to get there.
1163.16,"And also, have been"
going,through what
1165.58,sounds like a very long
iterative,process of trying
1168.16,to figure out what
works,and what
1169.54,doesn't work to finally
arrive,"at a solution,"
1172.15,and then make that the
basis,of much of the work
1175.152,that you're doing
today,for other people.
1176.86,I think it's very important
because,I think many people
1179.8,share with you this
notion,that there
1183.44,are indeed two
groups--,a happy group
1185.92,and then fated-to-be
unhappy,group.
1188.77,And it speaks to the fact that--
1192.16,"your story, rather, speaks"
to,the fact that what we see
1195.28,is not always what's going on
internally,with people and that
1200.11,this notion of there
just,being two groups--
1202.27,the happy or the haves
and,the have-nots--
1205.9,can't be the way that it
"works,",and there are probably
1208.15,many more people
suffering,"than we realize,"
1211.01,and that there is an
important,need for tools
1214.03,to overcome that suffering.
1215.78,So I really just hear you.
1217.39,Even early in our
"discussion,",I just
1218.89,want to extend a genuine
thanks,because so much
1222.04,of what I hear from people
is,"questions about health,"
1225.455,"and mental health,"
and,physical health.
1227.08,But that clearly
point,to the fact
1229.51,that many people are
struggling,to varying degrees.
1232.12,And even the people who
are,in this category
1234.13,of great childhood and
happiness,could do far better
1238.27,for themselves and then
also,for other people.
1240.8,So thank you for that.
1243.23,I want to know.
1245.311,At the point where you
realized,that nutrition
1248.65,can play a profound role
in,how you feel and operate
1252.07,in a large number
of,"domains, you"
1255.29,are still a student or a
resident,at that point?
1257.29,CHRIS PALMER: I was a resident.
1259.05,ANDREW HUBERMAN: At
that,"point, did you"
1260.07,decide that you were
going,to explore
1261.63,this in a professional context?
1263.973,CHRIS PALMER: Not yet.
1264.89,ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1265.723,So what was the journey
forward,into the work
1268.38,that you're doing now?
1271.68,CHRIS PALMER: So the
next,step was that I just
1274.23,had friends and
family,"who saw me,"
1277.56,saw that I had
improved,"my health,"
1279.69,saw that I lost some
weight,pretty easily.
1283.53,"In particular, I remember"
my,"sister and sister-in-law,"
1286.23,they got really pissed
at,me one Thanksgiving
1288.9,because I could resist all the
pumpkin,"pie, and apple pie,"
1292.08,and everything else.
1292.96,"They were like, how the"
hell,are you doing that?
1294.96,How are you resisting
all,of this food?
1297.57,"And I said, I don't"
crave,it anymore.
1299.29,"I don't want it, I'm fine."
1300.73,I'm just-- I'm having
turkey,and green beans.
1302.94,And that's good enough for me.
1305.35,So I got them to do the diet.
1307.41,And they too noticed dramatic
improvement,"in their moods,"
1310.8,"and energy, and sleep,"
and,everything else.
1314.11,"So within a few years, the"
primary,thing I noticed
1320.88,is this powerful
antidepressant,effect.
1325.11,"And now, I'm an"
attending,physician.
1328.77,I've got all these patients
in,my clinical practice
1331.2,with treatment resistant
mental,illness.
1333.0,I'm in a tertiary care hospital.
1335.26,So I almost never get
somebody,off the street
1339.0,with their first
episode,of depression.
1341.4,"Out of the gate, as"
part,"of my career,"
1344.1,I get treatment resistant
mental,disorders.
1346.48,So I get people who've already
been,"to 6-plus psychiatrists,"
1350.31,therapists.
1351.21,They've usually tried dozens
of,different medications.
1354.12,They've been in decades
of,psychotherapy.
1356.76,They've often had
ECT,and other things.
1359.85,And nothing's working.
1361.74,"And I'm thinking,"
"well,",we're kind
1363.39,of out of options for
these,other people.
1365.55,And this diet is having this
really,powerful antidepressant
1368.85,effect.
1369.66,I think I'm going to try it and
just,see if any of my patients
1372.42,are game to try it to see
if,it might help them.
1376.44,"Sure enough, it did."
1378.85,Didn't help everyone
and,not everybody
1380.7,was interested
and/or,able to do it.
1384.0,But some of the ones
who,were able to do it
1387.03,ended up having a remarkable and
powerful,antidepressant effect.
1391.44,One woman actually became
hypomanic,within a month.
1394.83,And she had been
depressed,pretty much
1397.59,nonstop for over five years--
1399.75,"chronically depressed, suicidal,"
in,and out of hospitals.
1403.71,And I saw her become hypomanic.
1405.24,"And I'm thinking,"
"wow,",this really
1406.68,is a powerful
antidepressant,effect.
1409.26,This is amazing.
1410.58,This is like a medication but
better,because it actually
1414.0,is working for her.
1417.6,But I laid low at that point
"because,","at that point,"
1421.59,we didn't have many clinical
trials,of the safety
1425.15,or efficacy of the Atkins
diet,for even weight loss
1428.72,"or diabetes, let alone"
any,mental disorders.
1431.79,And so I really actually felt
like,I'm on the fringe here.
1434.63,And this is not going to be
met,with praise by anyone.
1440.13,So I'm just going to lay low.
1441.77,I'm going to offer
it,to patients.
1445.25,And I went along that
way,up until 2016.
1452.27,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And may
I,just ask about the diet?
1454.46,"When you say ""Atkins diet,"""
so,"this is low to zero starch,"
1460.46,"so low carbohydrate diet,"
certainly,low sugar.
1463.61,CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
1465.02,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And was
it,traditional Atkins?
1468.2,Were you tailoring it to
the,individual patient
1470.72,depending on their
psychiatric,"symptoms,"
1473.96,whether or not they were
overweight,or not overweight?
1476.655,I'm assuming you're
not,"a nutritionist,"
1478.28,so how did you
prescribe,a nutrition
1481.49,plan for your patients?
1483.92,And what was involved
in,making sure
1485.81,that they adhered
to,"that, maybe even"
1488.643,some of the things
you,observed in terms
1490.31,of who was more willing to
try,this or not try this?
1493.57,Any observations
or,maybe even data?
1496.46,CHRIS PALMER: So early
"on,",I was winging it.
1498.5,And I was-- the
first,"few patients,"
1501.8,it was try this Atkins diet.
1504.02,"I want to see ketosis, so"
I,was going for ketones.
1507.043,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they
were,"pricking their finger,"
1509.21,and they were doing
a,blood ketone test?
1512.42,CHRIS PALMER: I didn't know
about,blood ketone monitors
1515.15,if they existed back then.
1516.62,So I was-- we were
using,urine strips.
1518.52,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which
are,not quite as accurate
1520.52,but still useful as a general
"guide,",from what I understand.
1522.94,CHRIS PALMER: True.
1523.26,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that right?
1523.76,CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
1524.155,ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1527.54,CHRIS PALMER: So I was strongly
recommending,that patients
1531.74,achieve urinary ketosis.
1534.17,And the interesting thing
is,"I noticed a pattern,"
1537.38,that when they were trying the
diet,"and not getting ketones,"
1540.265,they often did not get
a,clinical benefit.
1543.26,It was once they
got,into ketosis
1545.51,that I began to notice
the,clinical benefit
1548.63,and the powerful
antidepressant,effect.
1552.09,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So probably
any,"nutrition plan, a.k.a diet,"
1557.49,that elevated ketones in the
urine,to the point where you
1561.84,"would say, this"
person,is in ketosis--
1564.42,or they would say
I'm,in ketosis--
1566.52,that was a step in
the,"right direction,"
1568.74,independent of exactly what
they,were eating or not
1572.79,"eating to get there,"
including,fasting?
1576.24,"At that time, probably,"
fasting,wasn't as popular now.
1578.58,Thanks to the incredible work--
1580.65,"I think it's incredible, and"
he,is a former colleague.
1582.99,And I know there's a lot of
controversy,about fasting.
1585.06,"But I think, for many people,"
fasting,is a powerful tool.
1587.435,"For others, it's"
a,less useful tool
1590.01,--of Satchin Panda and others.
1593.67,But fasting certainly will
limit,your carbohydrate intake
1596.88,and get you into ketosis.
1598.02,Correct?
1598.543,CHRIS PALMER: It will.
1599.46,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you
have,any patients fast
1600.99,or do intermittent fasting?
1602.37,CHRIS PALMER: I did.
1606.3,I had some patients who did what
Atkins,"had called a fat fast,"
1610.92,where they eat primarily fat.
1613.65,So they either fast and/or
they,eat primarily fats
1617.04,to try to get into
a,state of ketosis.
1619.908,"So for some patients,"
it,was actually
1621.45,quite easy to get into
"ketosis,",especially overweight
1624.75,and obese patients.
1626.62,They have a lot of fat
stores,on their body
1628.53,and actually limiting
carbohydrates,
1630.57,usually results in high
levels,of ketosis for them.
1633.923,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And,they probably
1635.34,"feel better too, I"
"imagine,",because when
1637.47,we limit our starch
"intake,",we start
1639.6,to excrete a lot of water.
1640.74,People can get some
pretty,quick weight loss
1644.22,that even though it
may,"not be fat loss,"
1646.11,makes them feel literally
a,little lighter
1648.15,and maybe a little
more,energetic.
1650.117,Is that right?
1650.7,CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
1653.67,"And as the years went on,"
the,"field was advancing,"
1658.41,more research was coming out.
1661.11,People were getting a
little,more sophisticated
1663.27,"with blood ketone monitoring,"
with,different versions
1666.69,of ketogenic diets.
1668.52,And I was evolving my practice.
1675.08,The thing that completely
upended,everything
1678.185,"that I knew as a psychiatrist,"
"though,",was when I helped
1681.35,a patient in 2016 lose weight.
1684.75,"So this was a patient,"
33-year-old,man
1688.19,with schizoaffective disorder.
1690.23,He had been my patient
for,eight years now.
1692.06,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Could,you clarify
1692.75,for people what
schizoaffective,disorder is?
1694.73,I'm not a clinician.
1695.69,"But as I recall, it's like a"
low,level of schizophrenia.
1700.182,So there might be some
auditory,hallucinations.
1702.14,If I met this
"person,",I might think
1703.49,"they're kind of different,"
quote,"unquote, ""weird."""
1705.573,But they would not
seem,necessarily
1710.99,scary to me and to
typically,to other people.
1716.03,And I mean that with
"respect,",of course.
1717.742,"But oftentimes, people"
with,schizophrenia
1719.45,can seem just like--
you,don't even
1721.16,know how to interact with
them,because their world seems
1723.493,so altered because they have
all,these so-called positive
1726.627,"symptoms-- hallucinations,"
and,they're
1728.21,talking to people that no
one,"else can see, et cetera."
1730.49,Is that schizoaffective?
1732.41,CHRIS PALMER: So no.
1733.7,So schizoaffective is the same
as,schizophrenia essentially.
1737.51,The only difference
is,it's schizophrenia
1739.7,with superimposed mood episodes.
1741.447,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, so it's"
actually,more severe than--
1743.78,CHRIS PALMER: It can be.
1744.62,ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1744.92,So I have it backwards.
1745.94,CHRIS PALMER: So
schizoaffective,disorder
1747.98,is essentially schizophrenia
and,plus some mood episodes.
1751.193,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe"
I'm,thinking of schizotypal?
1753.485,CHRIS PALMER: Schizotypal
is,"the low grade,"
1756.8,"kind of mild paranoia, or"
kind,"of eccentric beliefs,"
1761.0,and other things.
1761.9,ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
1762.997,"Folks out there, I have"
my,nomenclature backwards.
1765.08,"Schizotypal is the,"
quote,"unquote, lower--"
1767.66,"""low level"" schizophrenia"
or,schizoid-like.
1771.47,Schizoaffective is
as,or more severe.
1773.757,CHRIS PALMER:
Full-blown,schizophrenia
1775.34,plus full-blown
usually,bipolarism.
1776.982,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: And now,"
it's,absolutely clear
1778.94,who the clinician
in,the room is.
1780.62,[LAUGHTER]
1781.16,Thank you for that reminder.
1783.2,CHRIS PALMER: No worries.
1784.55,So this man had
schizoaffective,disorder.
1788.666,He had daily auditory
hallucinations.,
1791.63,He had paranoid delusions.
1793.58,He could not go out in public
without,being terrified.
1798.47,He was convinced that there
were,"these powerful families,"
1802.37,that they had technologies that
could,control his thoughts.
1805.16,They could broadcast his
thoughts,to other people.
1807.44,They were trying to hurt him.
1808.88,They had targeted
him,for some reason.
1811.04,He wasn't quite sure why.
1812.63,He had some suspicions
and,beliefs about maybe
1815.96,when he did this bad thing when
he,"was 11 years old, that's why"
1820.31,they decided to target him.
1822.83,This man was tormented by
his,"illness, tormented."
1826.37,It ruined his life.
1828.17,He had already tried 17
different,"medications,"
1831.02,and none of them
stopped,his symptoms.
1833.36,But they did cause him
to,gain a lot of weight.
1835.86,ANDREW HUBERMAN: These
"medications,","as I recall,"
1837.86,for schizophrenia-- the
classical,ones are dopamine
1840.425,receptor blockers--
caused,people to--
1843.29,huge increases in prolactin.
1845.147,That's why sometimes men--
1846.23,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
1846.44,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --will
get,breast development.
1847.85,And they'll put on
a,lot of weight.
1849.308,And they'll be catatonic--
or,movement disorders.
1851.93,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
1852.68,ANDREW HUBERMAN: They
make,you feel like--
1854.43,"I have to imagine,"
given,how good
1856.46,most things that release
dopamine,"make us feel,"
1858.62,that blocking dopamine
receptors,with antipsychotics
1861.89,makes people feel lousy.
1863.96,CHRIS PALMER: Horrible.
1866.45,And it's a huge challenge in our
field,because a lot of patients
1869.84,don't want to take them.
1872.09,And then you get
these,rebound effects.
1874.1,If patients are on them
for,"several months,"
1876.29,and then they stop
them,"cold turkey,"
1878.12,they can get wildly
psychotic,"and ill,"
1880.64,end up aggressive or
hospitalized,or sometimes dead.
1889.39,So that's him.
1890.59,He weighs 340 pounds.
1892.81,"And for whatever reason,"
he,"gets it in his head,"
1895.33,I'm never going to
get,a girlfriend
1896.92,if I don't lose some weight.
1899.74,"He also recognizes,"
I'm,never going
1901.6,to get a girlfriend
because,I'm a loser.
1903.34,I'm schizophrenic.
1904.57,I live with my father.
1906.28,I have nothing going for me.
1908.18,But I could at
least,try to address
1911.62,"one of these awful, horrible"
things,about myself.
1915.19,And maybe I could
lose,some weight.
1917.05,So he asked for my help.
1919.69,For a variety of
"reasons,",we ended up
1921.25,deciding to try
the,ketogenic diet.
1923.65,"Now, at this point, I"
have,no anticipation
1928.18,that the ketogenic diet
is,going to do anything
1930.19,for his psychiatric
symptoms,because this man
1933.31,has schizoaffective disorder.
1934.6,That's not depression.
1935.99,Depression is very different.
1937.67,They're totally
different,disorders.
1940.77,So he decides to give it a try.
1944.36,"Within two weeks, not only"
does,"he start losing weight,"
1948.53,but I begin to notice this
dramatic,antidepressant effect.
1952.25,He's making better eye contact.
1954.17,He's smiling more.
1955.4,He's talking a lot more.
1957.2,"I'm thinking like,"
what's,gotten into you?
1959.09,You're coming to life.
1960.05,Like you're-- I've never
heard,you talk this much.
1962.133,I've never seen you so
excited,or present or alive.
1967.35,I haven't changed
his,meds at all.
1970.86,The thing that
upended,everything
1973.41,that I knew as a psychiatrist
was,"six to eight weeks in,"
1977.49,he spontaneously
starts,"reporting,"
1979.77,"you know, those voices"
that,I hear all the time?
1982.68,They're going away.
1985.44,"And he says, you know how I"
always,thought that there were
1988.29,all these families who were
controlling,my thoughts
1990.87,"and out to get me, and"
they,had targeted me?
1993.12,"And I'm thinking, oh, yeah."
1994.703,We've been talking about
that,for eight years.
1996.62,We can talk about that again.
1998.37,"He says, you know what?"
2002.88,"Now that I think about it,"
I,don't think that's true.
2006.077,"And now that I say it,"
it,sounds kind of crazy.
2008.035,It probably never was.
2011.28,I've probably had
schizophrenia,all along
2013.71,like everybody's been
trying,to tell me.
2016.82,And I think it's going away.
2020.3,That man went on--
2022.58,he's now lost 160 pounds
and,kept it off to this day.
2026.06,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
2027.29,CHRIS PALMER: He was
able,to do things
2029.3,he had not been able to do
since,the time of his diagnosis.
2032.21,He was able to complete
a,certificate program.
2034.67,He's able to go out in
public,and not be paranoid.
2038.03,He performed improv in
front,of a live audience.
2041.31,at?
2041.81,"One point, he was able to"
move,out of his father's home
2044.93,and live independently.
2047.46,And that completely blew
my,mind as a psychiatrist.
2054.969,And I went on a
scientific,journey
2057.909,to understand what in
the,hell just happened.
2060.82,ANDREW HUBERMAN: That
is,indeed mind-blowing.
2063.04,I'd like to take a quick
break,and acknowledge
2065.29,"one of our sponsors,"
Athletic,Greens.
2067.48,"Athletic Greens, now called AG1,"
is,a vitamin mineral probiotic
2071.77,drink that covers all of your
foundational,nutritional needs.
2075.13,I've been taking Athletic
Greens,"since 2012,"
2077.889,so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
2080.17,The reason I started taking
Athletic,Greens and the reason
2082.587,I still take Athletic Greens
once,or usually twice a day
2085.659,is that it gets
me,the probiotics
2087.76,that I need for gut health.
2089.409,Our gut is very important.
2090.55,It's populated by
gut,microbiota that
2093.06,"communicate with the brain, the"
immune,"system, and basically"
2095.56,all the biological
systems,of our body
2097.27,to strongly impact our
immediate,and long-term health.
2100.81,And those probiotics
in,Athletic Greens
2102.76,are optimal and vital
for,microbiotic health.
2106.513,"In addition, Athletic"
Greens,contains a number
2108.43,"of adaptogens,"
"vitamins,",and minerals
2110.05,that make sure that all of my
foundational,nutritional needs
2112.69,are met.
2113.32,And it tastes great.
2115.318,If you'd like to
try,"Athletic Greens,"
2116.86,you can go to
"athleticgreens.com/huberman,",
2120.04,and they'll give you five
free,travel packs that make it
2122.59,really easy to mix up
Athletic,Greens while
2124.607,"you're on the road, in the"
"car,","on the plane, et cetera."
2126.94,And they'll give you a year
supply,of vitamin D3/K2.
2130.51,"Again, that's"
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2133.12,to get the five free travel
packs,and the year supply
2135.7,of vitamin D3/K2.
2137.47,I have a couple of questions.
2139.16,"First of all, did"
he,stay on any kind
2141.91,of antipsychotic or
other,medication?
2145.33,"If so, were the dosages"
"adjusted,","excuse me,"
2148.84,while undergoing this
remarkable,transition?
2153.22,"Because as we know,"
it's,not an either
2155.08,or medication or nutrition
"changes,",it can be both.
2159.61,And then the other question
is,one of adherence.
2163.15,I think about someone with
schizoaffective,"disorder,"
2165.79,who's suffering from
all,the sorts of things
2168.34,that you described.
2170.28,How does somebody like that
organize,themselves in order
2172.83,to stay on a ketogenic diet?
2175.23,And I say this with all the
seriousness,in the world.
2177.485,I think there are
a,lot of people
2178.86,who do not have schizotypal
or,schizoaffective disorder
2182.85,"who have trouble, they claim,"
adhering,to a ketogenic diet.
2189.66,It's not the easiest diet.
2191.93,Certainly in its
extreme,"form at first,"
2194.51,it's not the easiest
diet,to stick to.
2197.85,So how did he do it?
2199.41,That sounds like a
remarkable,individual.
2202.17,And I'd also like to just
know,your general thoughts
2204.36,about adherence to things when
people,are back on their heels
2209.34,mentally.
2210.22,How do they get motivated
and,stick to something?
2213.7,"So the questions were,"
"medication,",yes or no?
2216.22,"If yes, dosage"
"adjusted,",yes or no.
2219.27,And if people are
suffering,from depression
2223.095,or full-blown
psychotic,"episodes,"
2225.21,how does one ensure that they
continue,to adhere to a diet?
2230.25,CHRIS PALMER: So in
terms,"of medications,"
2232.68,he has remained on medication.
2235.93,"So early on, I wasn't"
adjusting,anything.
2238.71,I was just in disbelief and
shock,that this was happening.
2242.49,I didn't know what was going on.
2244.83,"Over the years, we"
have,slowly but surely
2247.8,tried to taper him off his meds.
2249.9,He has been on meds for decades.
2253.02,He started medications
when,he was a young child.
2256.62,His brain is as
developed,in response
2263.04,to all sorts of
psychiatric,medications.
2266.25,And it has not been easy
to,try to get him off.
2270.03,We continue to try to
get,him off medication.
2272.76,And it's challenging
and,difficult.
2276.13,And I just want to say
for,"any listeners, it is--"
2279.36,getting off your meds is
very,difficult and dangerous.
2282.33,And you need to do
it,"with supervision,"
2284.73,with a mental health
professional,or a prescriber
2289.8,because it is dangerous.
2291.24,When people reduce
their,"meds too much,"
2294.54,they can get wildly symptomatic.
2297.312,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that
true,for depression as well?
2299.52,CHRIS PALMER: It's true for
any,psychiatric medication.
2302.76,The brain makes
adaptations,in response
2304.98,to psychiatric medications.
2306.99,And when you stop
them,cold turkey--
2310.71,some people are fine.
2312.09,But I wouldn't
recommend,finding out
2315.78,because I've seen patients--
when,"they stop antidepressants,"
2319.62,I've seen patients get
flooredly,depressed and suicidal
2324.0,within three months.
2325.17,"I had one patient,"
almost,quit her job
2327.63,because she became convinced
"that,","well, my life sucks,"
2332.73,and it's all because of my boss.
2334.17,And I know that she's just
a,horrible human being.
2338.07,And she's abusing me.
2339.3,"And I was like,"
"whoa,","whoa, whoa."
2341.28,I think this is related
to,your medication change.
2343.65,We got her back on her
"meds,","within three days,"
2347.74,"she said, oh my god, I"
can't,believe that happened.
2351.63,I almost quit my job.
2353.52,And that would have been the
most,illogical and irrational
2356.775,decision I've ever
made,in my entire life.
2359.97,"But somehow, it seemed so"
real,just several days ago.
2365.1,And now that I'm back
on,this medication--
2367.77,and it doesn't mean
that,she needs the meds.
2370.71,But it doesn't mean
that,he needs the meds.
2372.84,It means that meds need to
be,"adjusted very safely,"
2375.99,"and cautiously, and gradually."
2378.69,So that's the medication piece.
2380.25,The adherence piece was not easy
for,him and for other patients.
2385.71,It is very rare that I have
a,"patient who I can say,"
2389.7,do the ketogenic diet.
2391.02,"Come see me in 3 months, and"
let,me know how it was going.
2394.35,That almost never happens.
2397.21,"It has happened, I"
"think,",on two occasions.
2399.57,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that is, if"
I,"understand correctly, what--"
2402.78,perhaps not you-- but
many,psychiatrists
2405.39,do with medication.
2406.74,"It's, here's your prescription."
2408.36,Let's talk in--
2409.35,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
2410.1,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --a
month,or three months.
2411.21,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
2412.14,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's
a,variable that is probably
2414.39,worth us exploring
a,little bit here
2415.95,as the conversation continues.
2417.398,CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
2418.44,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That,frequent contact
2420.023,and making micro
adjustments,or macro
2422.4,adjustments to medication or
"nutrition,",could be meaningful.
2426.278,CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
2427.32,So with this particular
"patient,","early on, he"
2431.67,was actually pretty adherent.
2433.14,I was seeing him once a week.
2435.79,And so I could do
a,lot of education.
2438.3,I was weighing him.
2439.59,I was checking his ketones.
2441.24,I was checking his
glucose,levels.
2443.37,"At that point, I had a blood"
ketone,monitor in my office.
2446.85,So I knew whether he
was,"compliant or not,"
2449.97,which is so beneficial
in,doing clinical work
2454.08,and research on this diet.
2455.73,It's the only diet
where,"within seconds, I"
2458.85,can have an objective biomarker
of,compliance or noncompliance.
2463.38,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Such
a,"key point and again,"
2465.78,"brings to mind, for me, the"
parallel,with medication.
2469.11,A patient can say they're
taking,"their medication,"
2472.02,and unless they're in
a,"hospital setting,"
2474.278,where somebody's checking under
their,"tongue and all of this,"
2476.82,they very well could not be
taking,it or taking more.
2480.78,And you and I both
know,that blood
2484.14,draws for neurotransmitter
levels,are complicated
2486.687,because you want to
know,what's in the brain
2488.52,and what's functional
in,the brain.
2490.448,And then we have to imagine that
most,people there prescribed
2492.99,drugs for any number of
different,psychiatric
2495.66,conditions are not giving
blood,every time they
2497.82,talk to their psychiatrist
or,psychologist.
2499.62,No?
2500.52,CHRIS PALMER: No.
2502.815,"On that front, when we've"
looked,"at studies of compliance,"
2506.49,the majority of
patients,are at least
2510.27,somewhat noncompliant with
prescription,medications.
2513.99,It's not on purpose.
2516.96,They forgot.
2518.34,They take it at night.
2519.66,They were out late.
2521.52,They were off their routine.
2524.1,They forgot to
brush,their teeth--
2526.35,because that's when
they,take their meds.
2528.36,And so because it was
so,"late, they just"
2531.75,crashed when they got home.
2533.1,They forgot to take their meds.
2534.83,Happens all the time.
2536.61,If it's a medication that people
take,"more than once a day,"
2539.58,the noncompliance rates are
much,higher because it's just
2543.66,easy to forget.
2544.62,So it's not that people
are,willfully disobeying
2548.25,their doctors or anything else.
2550.21,It's just hard to remember
to,take meds consistently
2553.14,every day.
2554.28,ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you
say,"measuring ketones,"
2556.44,I want to drill into
this,a little bit
2558.81,because it does seem that
the,presence of ketones
2563.1,"and somebody being, quote"
"unquote,","""in ketosis,"""
2566.02,it turns out to be
the,key variable.
2567.52,"Certainly, in your book, that's"
one,of the major takeaways--
2571.21,although there were many
important,takeaways--
2574.12,that people get into ketosis.
2576.49,Do they have to stay in ketosis?
2578.62,"So for instance,"
I've,followed the--
2580.72,I don't any longer.
2581.68,"But I've tried, in the past,"
the,so-called cyclic ketogenic
2584.38,"diet, where every third"
or,"fourth day, get"
2586.45,"some pasta, or rice, et cetera."
2591.64,That was interesting
as,an experiment.
2594.19,"But to stay in ketosis, what"
sort,of blood levels of ketones
2600.07,do you like to see
in,your patients?
2602.44,What is the range that you think
most,people could aspire to?
2606.89,CHRIS PALMER: So it really
depends,on the patient
2609.01,"and what I'm treating,"
quite,honestly.
2613.44,And I don't think every patient
needs,the ketogenic diet.
2616.41,"For some patients, simply"
getting,rid of junk food
2618.72,can make a huge difference in
a,"mood disorder, for instance."
2621.643,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: So a junk food,"
"meaning,","highly processed food,"
2624.31,food that could last on
the,shelf a very long time.
2626.52,CHRIS PALMER: Highly
processed,foods
2628.2,that are usually high in
both,"sugar, carbohydrate,"
2631.83,"and carbs, and fats."
2634.95,Those seem to be
the,worst foods.
2638.07,That combination--
high,"sugar, high fat--"
2642.57,seems to be the
worst,combination
2644.46,for metabolic health.
2646.2,"And lo and behold, we've got"
emerging,"data that suggests,"
2650.37,"that strongly suggests, it's"
also,bad for mental health.
2653.79,Depression and anxiety are the
most,common mental disorders.
2657.39,And so we have the best
data,for those disorders.
2660.36,But we actually have a lot of
data,with even bipolar disorder
2663.9,and schizophrenia that insulin
"resistance,","in particular,"
2668.1,and insulin signaling
in,the brain
2671.22,is impaired in people with
chronic,mental disorders
2676.08,kind of across the board--
2677.91,all the way from chronic
"anxiety,","depression,"
2680.73,"to bipolar, to schizophrenia,"
and,even Alzheimer's disease.
2684.39,We know that patients with
all,of those disorders
2687.15,have impaired glucose metabolism
and,that the insulin signaling
2693.285,"system in the brain, which"
is,different than insulin
2695.85,signaling in the
"periphery,",seems to somehow
2700.53,possibly be playing a role.
2704.16,"So to step back from that,"
so,"for some patients,"
2706.8,I might just want to decrease
glucose,and insulin levels.
2710.41,And I can do that by
getting,rid of sweets.
2713.43,"For other patients,"
like,patients
2715.8,with schizoaffective disorder
or,schizophrenia or bipolar
2718.53,"disorder, especially"
if,"it's chronic,"
2720.6,if I'm using it as
a,"brain treatment,"
2724.83,then I do want a ketogenic diet.
2727.38,And I usually want reasonably
high,levels of blood ketones.
2731.52,"Usually, for depression, I"
want,to see at least greater
2736.01,than probably 0.8 minimal.
2739.25,For psychotic disorders
and,"bipolar disorder,"
2744.38,I usually want to see
levels,greater than 1.5.
2747.98,That's what I'm shooting
"for,",if at all possible.
2755.57,"So yeah, I think"
that's,what I'd go for.
2759.59,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so--"
2760.97,"and sorry, I didn't"
mean,to imply
2762.38,that people need to
be,in ketosis in order
2764.78,to see some mental health
benefits,from changing
2767.63,their diet.
2769.52,You make very clear
in,your book--
2771.14,and we'll go into
this,in more detail--
2773.54,that avoiding
insulin,"resistance,"
2776.76,"reversing insulin resistance,"
and,essentially trying
2780.3,to reverse what
earlier,you described
2782.55,as this metabolic
"syndrome,",which
2785.37,is a bunch of different
"things,",is the target.
2788.79,"And for some people, getting"
rid,of highly processed foods
2792.39,and focusing mainly on
nonprocessed,or minimally
2794.97,processed foods
will,really help.
2796.5,"For others, going straight to"
the,full-blown ketogenic diet
2799.74,will be of most benefit.
2802.34,I'd like to back up a
little,bit in history
2804.65,and get to something which I
find,"incredibly interesting,"
2808.89,which is epilepsy and
the,longstanding use
2812.87,of ketogenic diet and
fasting,to treat epilepsy.
2816.98,And the reason I want to kind of
rewind,to that point in history
2821.06,"is that, I think that for a"
lot,of listeners and people
2825.89,out there who are familiar
with,how changing your diet
2830.09,or changing your
exercise,can positively
2832.1,impact sleep and weight
and,"all these things,"
2834.32,and it cascades into
feeling,better--
2836.54,that makes perfect sense.
2838.32,But for a lot of
the,"world still,"
2841.27,the idea that changing or using
nutrition,as a dissection tool
2847.39,or as a treatment tool
to,understand and treat
2850.45,"mental illness, is still"
a,"kind of heretical idea,"
2854.05,"that to them, it"
kind,"of falls in the,"
2855.91,"OK, well, that's like a woo"
science,or something like that.
2859.6,"Now, obviously you're a"
board-certified,physician
2862.27,or psychiatrist at arguably one
of,the finest medical schools
2866.59,"in the world, Harvard"
Medical,School.
2869.38,Even though I'm on the
Stanford,"side, we acknowledge--"
2871.63,we acknowledge our East Coast--
2873.67,CHRIS PALMER:
You're,the Harvard--
2874.12,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --friends.
2874.54,CHRIS PALMER: --of
the,West Coast.
2875.5,ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're
not,going to talk--
2876.16,OK.
2876.505,CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
2876.85,ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're
not,going to talk--
2877.63,CHRIS PALMER: Or we're the
Stanford,of the East Coast.
2879.4,ANDREW HUBERMAN: That argument
could,go back and forth
2881.65,a number of times.
2882.79,You're a serious clinician
and,a serious scientist.
2886.36,And you're a serious thinker.
2889.09,But for a lot of
people,"out there,"
2891.04,the notion of using
"diet,",they immediately
2894.07,"think, ah, well, that"
makes,perfect sense.
2897.1,Or I think there's a category
of,"people who think, well, yeah,"
2900.31,didn't Atkins die
of,a heart attack?
2902.14,I hear that a lot.
2904.51,That was crazy.
2905.83,People immediately
discard,the Atkins diet
2909.49,"for that reason, which I do"
think,is throwing the baby out
2912.808,with the bathwater.
2913.6,But it's an interesting
thing,nonetheless.
2915.577,And then I think that
the,majority of people
2917.41,sit in the middle
and,just want to see
2920.17,science and medicine come up
with,treatments that work.
2922.85,"And I have to say, I'm very"
relieved,to hear what you said
2926.262,"earlier, which was-- you never"
said,that people should come
2928.72,off their medication
and,just become--
2930.52,go on a ketogenic diet and
everything,will be cured.
2933.04,You're certainly
not,saying that.
2934.432,CHRIS PALMER: No.
2935.14,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And,rather you're
2936.73,"saying, if I"
understand,"correctly,"
2938.8,that nutrition needs
to,be considered
2941.47,one of the major tools in the
landscape,of effective tools
2945.13,and that it can
be,"very effective,"
2946.6,evidenced by the
story,that you shared.
2948.55,And there are many
other,stories in there
2950.86,as well of truly
miraculous,transformations.
2955.16,So let's talk about epilepsy and
how,the ketogenic diet is not
2959.74,just used for
epilepsy,but is one
2962.53,"of the oldest, if not"
the,"oldest, examples"
2965.44,of the use of nutrition
to,treat a condition
2969.16,of the nervous system
that,can be incredibly
2971.35,"debilitating, even deadly."
2972.838,CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
2973.63,And the reality is
that,"this literature,"
2977.38,"and this clinical history, and"
all,of the research we have
2980.95,was the godsend that I needed
to,do the work that I'm doing.
2985.72,"Otherwise, I would have"
been,discredited on day one.
2989.3,Chris Palmer is claiming
that,a dietary change
2992.3,can influence schizophrenia
or,schizoaffective disorder.
2995.54,That's impossible.
2996.77,And he's a quack.
2999.15,But the thing that immediately
got,me credibility was I
3003.19,didn't focus on it as a diet.
3006.58,I did a deep dive into
the,epilepsy literature.
3010.58,"So the ketogenic diet,"
unbeknownst,"to most people,"
3014.38,was actually developed a
hundred,"years ago, 1921,"
3019.39,by a physician for one
and,only one purpose--
3023.23,to treat epilepsy.
3025.03,It wasn't developed
as,a weight loss diet.
3027.19,It wasn't developed as the diet
that,all human beings should
3030.97,follow.
3032.52,And the reason it
was,developed is
3034.2,because of this
longstanding,"observation,"
3038.46,"since the time of Hippocrates,"
that,fasting can stop seizures.
3045.07,"Now, fasting is"
not,a healthy diet.
3048.6,Fasting is the
process,of no diet.
3053.77,So we now understand a
tremendous,amount of science.
3057.25,Most people think going
without,food is bad.
3061.1,And they equate it
with,starvation.
3063.97,"But in fact, when"
we,"go without food,"
3066.61,it causes tremendous
shifts,in metabolism--
3070.33,both brain and body metabolism.
3073.15,And it puts the body into a mode
of,"autophagy, and conservation"
3078.91,"of resources, and all"
sorts,of things that
3083.65,are beneficial to human health.
3085.55,And this is why
fasting,has been used
3087.4,as a therapeutic intervention
in,"almost every culture,"
3090.55,in almost every religion
for,a millennia.
3095.802,But for the most
"part,",that was all
3097.26,thought to be
religious,folklore.
3099.375,That was just crazy talk.
3100.68,And those stupid people
way,back then thought
3104.37,God cured everything.
3105.67,And so they fasted.
3106.71,And they just assumed that
they,were getting better.
3109.65,"Well, in 1921, one physician"
used,intermittent fasting
3116.69,on a child with seizures and
found,"that, oh, Lo and behold,"
3120.03,this religious folklore
stuff,has something to it.
3122.15,It actually worked.
3123.98,The problem with
fasting,is that you
3125.78,can only fast for so long
before,you starve to death.
3128.21,And that's not a very
effective,treatment.
3130.49,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And this child
was,"ingesting water, correct?"
3134.19,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
3134.94,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was just
food,elimination fasting.
3136.79,CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination.
3137.495,ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
3138.328,CHRIS PALMER: So
no,special diet.
3141.11,But the problem with
fasting,for epilepsy
3143.81,is that as soon as people start
eating,"a normal diet again,"
3146.51,their seizures usually
come,right back--
3148.85,"oftentimes, with a vengeance."
3150.77,And so it can be a good
short-term,intervention.
3154.883,The fasting can take a
few,days because it can
3156.8,take a few days to get ketosis.
3159.92,And then you can get some
relief,from chronic seizures.
3163.34,But it's not a good
long-term,treatment
3165.68,"because, again, people"
will,starve to death.
3169.16,As soon as they start
"eating,",seizures come back.
3171.59,So it was actually Dr. Russell
Wilder,at the Mayo Clinic
3175.46,who developed the ketogenic diet
with,one and only one purpose.
3179.49,"He wanted to see, can we"
mimic,"the fasting state, using"
3184.94,"this special diet, to see if it"
might,stop seizures long-term?
3191.72,"And lo and behold, it worked."
3194.66,Early results were
extraordinarily,positive.
3197.72,50% of patients who
use,the ketogenic diet
3200.6,became seizure-free.
3202.25,And another 35% had a
50%,or greater reduction
3206.84,"in their seizure frequency,"
so,about 85% efficacy rate.
3210.32,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Sorry,to interrupt.
3211.82,I didn't mean to do that there.
3214.07,Was it just for
pediatric,epilepsy
3216.41,or for adult epilepsy as well?
3218.042,CHRIS PALMER: So
back,"in the 1920s,"
3219.5,we didn't have many
anti-epilepsy,treatments.
3222.35,And a lot of adults
were,struggling as well.
3224.4,So they were using it on
anybody,who would do the diet.
3228.74,"By the 1950s, pharmaceuticals"
were,coming out.
3232.49,And we had many more
anticonvulsant,treatments.
3235.19,"And there's no question, they"
work,for a lot of people.
3238.91,That's great.
3239.93,And taking a pill is so much
easier,than doing this diet.
3243.53,So the diet pretty
much,fell out of favor.
3245.69,And nobody was using it from
the,1950s to about the '70s.
3250.19,"But lo and behold, even to"
this,"day, people with epilepsy,"
3254.78,about 30% don't respond
to,the current treatments
3258.5,that we have available.
3259.76,30% will have treatment
resistant,"epilepsy,"
3262.62,which means they
continue,to have seizures
3264.62,no matter how many
anticonvulsants,"they're taking,"
3267.44,even if they've
had,brain surgery.
3269.48,It just doesn't
stop,their seizures.
3272.18,"And so in the 1970s,"
the,ketogenic diet
3274.61,was resurrected at Johns Hopkins
for,these treatment-resistant
3278.48,cases.
3279.11,"And lo and behold, it works--"
3281.18,"not for all of them,"
but,it works in--
3284.86,about 1/3 become seizure-free.
3288.613,And these are people who've
tried,everything and nothing's
3291.03,working.
3291.53,So 1/3 become seizure-free.
3293.34,Another third get
a,"clinical benefit,"
3295.87,meaning a 50% or greater
reduction,in their seizure
3298.17,frequency.
3299.04,"And the other third, it"
doesn't,seem to work.
3302.05,It's not always clear if
that's,because of noncompliance
3304.71,or if that's because the
diet's,just not working.
3307.38,"But about a third,"
a,"third, a third--"
3309.87,"seizure freedom,"
reduction,"in seizures,"
3312.39,or it just doesn't work.
3315.7,"And so the reality,"
the,godsend for me
3318.93,is that we have decades
of,neuroscience research
3321.78,on the ketogenic diet and
what,it is doing to the brain.
3324.87,We know that the ketogenic diet
is,influencing neurotransmitter
3328.77,"levels-- in particular,"
"glutamate,","GABA, adenosine."
3332.43,It changes calcium channel
regulation,and calcium
3336.36,"levels, which is really"
important,in the function
3338.64,of cells.
3340.32,It changes gene expression.
3342.9,It reduces brain inflammation.
3345.33,It changes the gut microbiome.
3348.0,Gut microbiome is a
huge,topic right now.
3349.92,And there are some
researchers,who
3351.337,argue that is the primary
benefit,of the ketogenic diet--
3354.06,it's changing the gut
microbiome,in beneficial ways.
3358.12,So it's doing a lot of things.
3359.88,It obviously improves
insulin,resistance.
3363.015,"It lowers glucose levels,"
lowers,"insulin levels,"
3366.3,which improves
insulin,signaling.
3369.6,The key for my research that
I've,"outlined, the real magic,"
3377.88,is that this diet stimulates
two,processes that
3382.08,relate to mitochondria.
3383.85,It stimulates a process
called,"mitophagy,"
3386.67,which is getting rid of old
and,"defective mitochondria,"
3390.18,and replacing them
with,new ones.
3392.16,And it also stimulates
a,process called
3394.14,mitochondrial
"biogenesis,",which means
3397.26,that after people have done the
ketogenic,diet for a while--
3401.31,months or years-- many of
their,cells in their bodies
3405.69,and brains will have
more,mitochondria.
3409.45,And those mitochondria
will,be healthier.
3412.8,And I believe that is the reason
the,ketogenic diet is such
3417.81,a powerful treatment not
only,for epilepsy but also
3421.59,for people with chronic
mental,disorders.
3424.698,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Would
you,mind listing off
3426.49,a few of the mental disorders?
3429.73,And I know this is not
meant,"to be inside ball,"
3432.658,but we should distinguish
between,psychiatric disorders
3434.95,and neurological
symptoms,and diseases.
3440.35,The fields of
psychiatry,and neurology
3442.342,hopefully someday
will,just emerge.
3443.8,"But for instance,"
typically,if somebody
3446.8,is presenting with
something,that
3449.05,looks like
"Alzheimer's,","dementia,"
3451.06,they'll talk to a neurologist.
3452.47,"Whereas, if somebody is"
presenting,"with symptoms,"
3454.59,"like schizophrenia, bipolar,"
they'll,talk to a psychiatrist.
3457.09,But if you wouldn't
mind,"wearing a dual hat,"
3460.6,could you just
quickly,list off some
3462.85,of the neurologic and
psychiatric,disorders
3466.57,for which ketogenic--
3468.73,or let's just say--
nutrition,changes
3471.16,have been shown to improve
symptoms,significantly.
3473.618,And then maybe we can dive
into,a couple of these
3475.66,as well as get more deeply
into,these two very interesting
3478.99,aspects of mitochondrial
function,and repair
3481.96,and turnover.
3482.74,CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
3485.575,In terms of nutritional
"psychiatry,",it's a broad field.
3489.38,"And it's in its infancy,"
is,the real answer.
3492.25,If you're looking for randomized
controlled,trials documenting
3495.22,efficacy in large numbers of
patients,"with these disorders,"
3500.14,we don't have them.
3501.64,They're underway now.
3503.2,But we don't have them yet.
3504.91,What we do have
are,case studies.
3508.96,We have a lot of
mechanistic,science papers
3514.57,by some of the leading
neuroscientists,
3516.55,and psychiatrists in the world--
3518.08,and neurologists in the
world,"kind of outlining,"
3521.89,this is everything we know that
the,ketogenic diet is doing.
3524.77,These are the
problems,in the brains
3527.14,of people with these chronic
mental,or neurological
3530.02,disorders.
3530.78,So we know that
they,should work.
3533.02,But the disorders range
from,chronic depression to--
3539.86,we've got a trial
underway,for PTSD.
3543.31,We've got one
actually,decent pilot
3547.69,trial from the
National,Institutes
3549.85,of Health for the ketogenic
diet,"for alcohol use disorder,"
3553.72,of all things.
3554.8,And we can go into
that,a little more.
3556.66,We've got a couple of pilot
trials,of the ketogenic diet
3559.81,for Alzheimer's disease.
3562.6,And those are randomized
controlled,trials.
3564.79,We've got case studies
of,the ketogenic diet
3569.14,"for chronic depression, bipolar"
"disorder,",and schizophrenia.
3573.4,The largest study that we've
got,in that mental health sphere
3578.02,is a pilot study of 31 patients
admitted,to a French hospital.
3587.78,28 of those patients
were,able to do the diet
3590.57,and stay on the diet.
3592.83,"So 10%, off the"
"bat,","noncompliant,"
3596.3,couldn't do the diet.
3597.39,So we need to include that.
3598.79,But of the 28 patients
who,were able to do--
3601.1,and these are 28 patients with
treatment-resistant,mental
3603.5,"disorders, chronic depression,"
"bipolar,",and schizophrenia.
3607.91,Of the patients who were able
to,"do the ketogenic diet,"
3610.64,100% had at least some
improvement,in symptoms.
3614.24,46% had remission of illness.
3618.35,"Remission of illness,"
that,does not
3620.15,happen with current treatments.
3622.43,"And 64%, I think, were"
discharged,on less medicine
3628.91,than they went into
the,hospital on.
3631.43,So it wasn't that the people
were,prescribing more medicine
3635.97,and that's why.
3637.19,They were being discharged
on,less medication.
3641.46,We've got at least--
3642.56,"again, a lot of the hard core"
scientists,"are going to say,"
3645.68,show us the randomized
controlled,trial
3647.9,with hundreds of patients.
3649.98,And we've got five randomized
controlled,"trials underway now,"
3654.89,funded primarily
through,philanthropy.
3659.66,I can tell you that--
3662.93,we've talked about
that,one index patient.
3665.24,"But at this point, I have now"
treated,dozens of patients.
3668.84,And I've heard from
hundreds,of patients
3671.69,who've been treated by other
"clinicians,",researchers--
3675.23,or I've just heard from
patients,from around the world--
3678.02,who have shared stories
of,complete remission
3682.61,"of long, chronic"
mental,disorders--
3687.29,like bipolar disorder
and,schizophrenia--
3690.08,off of psychiatric meds.
3691.52,Some of them-- not all
of,"them, but some of them"
3693.77,are able to get off
all,psychiatric meds
3696.47,and remain in remission.
3699.88,"Again, I think I"
didn't,say this before.
3704.3,But it's really
important,to mention.
3706.54,For people who
might,be unfamiliar
3709.0,with the mental health field and
its,"connection with epilepsy,"
3713.29,the reason that it's such
an,important connection
3715.96,is that we use
epilepsy,treatments
3717.94,in psychiatric patients
every,day in tens of millions
3721.57,of people.
3723.14,So a lot of people
don't,"know this,"
3725.24,but I'll list off some names
that,a lot of your listeners
3729.88,may have heard of.
3730.87,And they probably know
them,as psychiatric drugs.
3733.09,"But in fact, these"
are,epilepsy drugs.
3735.22,"Depakote, Tegretol,"
"Lamictal,","Topamax, Neurontin"
3739.09,"or gabapentin, Valium,"
"Klonopin,",Xanax--
3744.1,those are all medications
that,stop seizures.
3747.37,And many of them were developed
initially,for seizures.
3753.43,"But we, in the"
mental,"health field,"
3755.26,quickly steal them and start
using,them in tens of millions
3758.77,"of people, even if"
they're,off label.
3760.82,"So that means, we don't have"
research,studies documenting
3763.87,that they're effective.
3765.02,But we go ahead
and,use them anyway
3767.41,because the reality is far too
many,patients aren't getting
3770.56,better with the
FDA-approved,treatments
3772.75,that we do have to offer.
3774.38,So psychiatrists are just
winging,it in some cases.
3777.52,And we're just throwing
whatever,we can at them
3780.25,and we absolutely include
epilepsy,treatments.
3783.26,"So in many ways, using"
the,ketogenic diet
3786.04,as a treatment for
serious,"mental disorders,"
3788.11,is nothing new at all.
3790.117,It's an established
evidence-based,treatment
3791.95,for epilepsy.
3793.21,We use evidence-based
treatments,for epilepsy
3796.18,across the board for a wide
range,of mental disorders.
3799.9,And so in many
"ways,",that's all I'm
3801.64,doing with the ketogenic diet.
3803.23,It just happens to be a diet.
3804.73,[CHUCKLES]
3805.975,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.
3807.1,I love it.
3808.0,"And I should say, I"
love,it because we
3811.42,had a guest on here early
days,of the podcast.
3814.09,He's a colleague of
mine,at Stanford.
3815.93,"He's a bioengineer, and a"
"psychiatrist,",phenomenal
3819.28,scientist and
"psychiatrist,",called
3821.47,"Deisseroth, who won the Lasker"
"prize,",and so on and so forth.
3824.708,And he made a really
important,"point,"
3826.25,which should have
been,obvious to me
3827.77,but wasn't until
he,"said it, which"
3830.62,"was the psychiatrist has tools,"
just,like the surgeon has
3835.64,tools.
3836.14,But the tools are language
and,observing behavior.
3841.33,Those are the dissection
tools,for what's
3843.55,going on in someone's brain.
3844.81,And then as a
"neuroscientist,",I'm
3846.612,familiar with the
neurotransmitters,
3848.07,and neuromodulators.
3849.37,And you mentioned that--
3852.66,and there are these tools of
altering,"brain chemistry, which"
3858.03,are of the sorts of
drugs,you just listed
3859.95,"off, or antidepressants,"
or,"antipsychotics,"
3862.14,that fall into these
major,bins of adjusting
3864.09,dopamine or adjusting
serotonin,or some combination
3866.58,"of dopamine, serotonin"
"epinephrine,","adenosine,"
3869.34,"and on, and on, and on."
3870.66,"And it seems to me, it's"
an,incredible field.
3874.63,But that the field is still
very,much in its infancy
3877.33,that it wasn't about a hundred
years,ago that people were
3881.32,measuring bumps on the head as
a,"way to diagnose phrenology,"
3884.47,and that there's still
so,much to learn.
3887.09,"And so when I hear you say,"
adjusting,nutrition or putting
3890.29,people into a ketogenic state
or,even just eliminating
3892.75,"highly processed foods,"
"sugars,","et cetera,"
3894.693,taking care of
metabolic,"syndrome,"
3896.11,and then observing
tremendous,relief
3898.6,in clinical syndromes of--
3901.75,"or symptoms, rather, of"
psychiatric,"disorders,"
3904.99,it makes perfect sense to me.
3906.31,It's yet another
dissection,tool.
3908.35,And a tool for altering
brain,chemistry.
3912.655,"If I think about the landscape,"
the,sort of sociology out there
3915.28,of--
3916.03,"again, there seem to be these"
"bins,",like a third of people
3918.94,"saying, of course,"
"diet,","and exercise,"
3921.04,"and social connection,"
and,limiting
3922.75,"stress, that's the good stuff."
3924.77,That's the stuff
that,we really works.
3926.54,And then about a third of
people,are sort of unclear.
3928.31,And then a third of
people,"think, well,"
3929.935,if it's not a
prescription,"drug, then"
3932.14,it just has no
place,in medicine.
3934.36,"And hopefully, that's changing."
3936.282,"And certainly, the"
work,that you're doing
3937.99,is going to be important
in,that transition
3941.38,that I think we will see.
3943.5,I'd like to talk about mitophagy
and,mitochondrial biogenesis.
3949.97,I think most people learn that
the,mitochondria are the energy
3954.5,factories of cells and
that,"indeed, they are."
3957.087,"As a neuroscientist,"
what,I know about
3958.67,them is that they are present
everywhere,in neurons.
3960.837,Not just in the
so-called,"cell body,"
3962.64,but you can find mitochondria
in,the furthest little bits
3965.93,of neurons.
3966.47,And neurons can be
quite,"big, very large."
3969.17,"In fact, meters long or more"
in,"some cases and some species,"
3972.96,including us.
3973.785,Depending on how tall somebody
"is,",could be many meters--
3976.16,or several meters rather.
3979.45,And that mitochondria do a
lot,of stuff besides just
3982.48,"produce energy,"
because,I think people
3984.142,"hear ""mitochondria,"" ""energy,"""
and,"they think, oh, so"
3986.35,these patients felt better.
3987.502,They lost weight.
3988.21,They had more energy.
3989.14,And then they're doing better.
3990.39,But here we're talking
about,remission
3992.23,"of auditory hallucinations,"
people,feeling suicidal
3997.48,and then changing their
diet,and feeling like life
4000.24,is something they can deal
"with,",and maybe even function
4002.88,"extremely well, and et cetera."
4004.53,So maybe we could just
talk,about mitochondria
4006.6,for a moment.
4007.227,And then talk about
these,two major effects.
4009.06,What are some of
the,other things
4010.53,that mitochondria are important
for,in neurons and maybe
4015.45,other cells of the brain?
4016.95,Because as an access
point,"for all this,"
4019.132,I think it would be great
if,people could learn
4021.09,a little mitochondrial biology.
4024.96,CHRIS PALMER: So I guess the
first,thing that I'll say
4027.21,is that this field is one of
the,most cutting-edge fields
4034.67,in medicine right now.
4039.08,"20 years ago or so, I think the"
majority,of research scientists
4043.82,thought of
mitochondria,as nothing
4045.59,more than little batteries.
4047.96,They take food and oxygen
and,turn it into ATP.
4052.16,And that's really important.
4053.36,"Yeah, we get that."
4054.5,But they're just
little,batteries.
4056.69,That's all they are.
4059.46,And so one of the reasons
that,this work is so important
4066.38,it's because it combines
cutting-edge,research
4069.05,in the metabolic field
in,the aging field.
4073.46,And we can start to pair
it,with a mental health
4077.12,and neurological health field.
4079.44,So mitochondria-- one
scientist,gave me this analogy.
4085.96,"He said, if you think of"
the,"cell as a computer,"
4089.968,a lot of people
think,of mitochondria
4091.51,as the power cord
to,that computer
4093.34,because they're
providing,the power.
4095.02,"And they are, in fact, the"
power,cord to that computer.
4098.819,"But actually,"
their,real function
4100.194,is the motherboard
of,that computer.
4102.979,So mitochondria are directing
in,allocating resources
4106.899,throughout a cell.
4107.92,That is their primary function.
4110.02,And then they happen to
be,powerhouses as well.
4112.939,And so to give some
clear,"examples,"
4116.14,mitochondria play a direct role
in,"the production, and release,"
4121.27,and regulation of some
really,"key neurotransmitters,"
4124.819,"including serotonin, dopamine,"
"glutamate,",acetylcholine.
4131.8,Those are pretty powerful
neurotransmitters.,
4133.795,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,"
I,would call those--
4135.1,I would consider those the--
4136.353,I know you listed
more,than three.
4137.77,But the sort of primary
colors,of neurotransmission.
4141.279,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
4142.029,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Any one of
those,in excess or deficiency
4146.02,is going to have
profound,negative effects
4148.75,on a nervous system.
4149.87,Or it's going to alter the way
that,"people and animals feel,"
4153.52,"think, move--"
4154.39,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
4155.14,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"--remember,",et cetera.
4157.359,CHRIS PALMER: So mitochondria
are,providing both some
4160.149,of the building
"blocks,","if you will,"
4162.859,for some of those
molecules,that are
4165.22,"part of the Krebs,"
citric,acid cycle.
4167.74,Some of the
intermediate,products
4170.08,actually go into making
those,neurotransmitters.
4172.93,"Much more importantly,"
mitochondria,
4175.21,provide the energy
for,the production
4177.37,of those neurotransmitters.
4178.569,"And fascinatingly, mitochondria"
are,directly related
4182.859,to the release of
neurotransmitters.,
4185.62,ATP alone is not enough.
4188.439,There have been some research
studies,that have actually
4190.84,found that
mitochondria,move along
4194.5,the membrane of the synapse
to,release batches of vesicles
4200.77,"of neurotransmitters, and that"
if,the mitochondria are removed
4204.97,from the synapse and researchers
flood,"that cell with ATP,"
4211.33,neurotransmitters usually
are,not getting released.
4214.9,Mitochondria are
doing,other things.
4217.94,We don't entirely even
understand,what all they're
4220.78,doing or how they're doing it.
4222.59,But they're doing other things
than,just providing the power.
4227.68,Another really
important,example is
4229.48,that mitochondria are actually
the,primary regulators
4233.89,of epigenetics.
4235.48,If you look at any one factor--
4237.743,so one study actually
found,that they're
4239.41,responsible for the
expression,of about 60%
4244.12,of the genes in a cell.
4248.98,And mitochondria do
this,through a lot
4250.69,of ways that have been known
for,years and sometimes decades.
4253.74,So mitochondria are
directly,related
4255.76,to the levels of reactive
oxygen,species in a cell.
4259.54,They are managing calcium
regulation,in cells.
4264.5,And we know that those
things,play a role
4266.71,in epigenetic expression.
4268.3,We know the levels of ATP to
ADP,or AMP also play a role.
4274.19,And mitochondria are
doing,those things.
4276.588,"But it turns out,"
mitochondria,are actually
4278.38,doing much more
sophisticated,things
4279.91,than even those in terms
of,gene expression.
4282.7,Mitochondria at
least,play a role
4285.58,in all of the aspects of
the,human stress response.
4290.21,So when humans are
"stressed,",either
4292.45,physically or
"psychologically,",there
4296.71,are several things that happen--
4299.23,increased cortisol increased
"adrenaline,","noradrenaline,"
4303.7,"inflammation, and gene"
expression--,"in particular,"
4306.91,in the hippocampus-- occur
with,the stress response.
4310.75,And one group of
researchers,actually
4312.79,genetically modified
mitochondria,
4314.71,in four different
"ways,",and found
4316.27,that all of the stress
"response,",all those four
4320.32,buckets of stress response were
impacted,"in one way or another,"
4325.33,implying that
mitochondria,are somehow
4328.06,playing a role in those.
4330.85,In terms of their
role,"in cortisol,"
4334.0,we know that
mitochondria,actually
4335.92,have the enzyme required for the
synthesis,of steroid hormones.
4341.51,"So that includes cortisol,"
"estrogen,","testosterone,"
4345.04,"and progesterone, some"
names,that maybe everybody's
4347.86,heard of.
4350.47,so that means that
if,mitochondria
4353.98,are in short supply
or,"dysfunctional,"
4357.46,the production of those hormones
may,become dysregulated.
4364.21,Mitochondria play a direct
role,in inflammation.
4368.11,And they turn the
inflammatory,system both on--
4374.17,or they at least play a role in
turning,the inflammatory system
4376.96,both on and off.
4379.24,I'm not going to be able
to,quote the exact study
4381.46,and author.
4382.12,But one paper in cell actually
identified,mitochondria
4386.44,as the key regulator in turning
certain,"inflammatory cells off,"
4390.73,and that when you inhibit
mitochondrial,"function,"
4393.22,"those cells don't turn off,"
that,mitochondrial levels
4396.91,of reactive oxygen species
are,a key signaling process
4402.46,to turn the inflammatory
cell,process off.
4406.12,Another study found
that,macrophages--
4408.92,so macrophages are an
important,immune cell
4412.06,that play a role in healing.
4413.6,"So if you cut yourself,"
your,body will get--
4417.4,send inflammation that way
and,send immune cells that way
4422.32,to try to heal your skin.
4424.42,And macrophages play an
important,role in that healing.
4427.96,One group of researchers
tried,to figure out
4430.6,how do macrophages
know,to switch
4433.78,between the different
phases,of wound healing
4436.51,because the macrophages
do,different things
4439.03,in the different phases
of,wound healing.
4441.73,And the conclusion of
all,of their research
4444.55,was that it's mitochondria.
4446.29,Mitochondria are sending
the,essential signals
4450.1,that change the state
of,the macrophages
4453.1,to induce these different
phases,of wound healing.
4458.26,So I've just talked about
"neurotransmitters,","hormones,"
4462.49,"epigenetic expression,"
inflammation.,
4467.42,For anybody familiar with
the,"mental health field,"
4471.31,they know these are some of the
key,variables that researchers
4477.4,have been struggling with for
"decades,",trying to figure out
4480.85,how do these fit together.
4482.87,We know that all
of,those buckets
4486.1,can be disrupted in people
with,mental disorders.
4492.33,And our field has
struggled,"to understand,"
4494.79,but how do they fit together?
4496.72,How can we make sense
of,this disruption?
4500.43,And I believe once
you,understand
4503.49,"the science of mitochondria,"
you,can actually
4507.77,connect all of the dots of
the,mental illness puzzle.
4511.242,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to,take a brief break
4513.2,"and thank our sponsor,"
InsideTracker.,
4516.11,InsideTracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
4518.75,that analyzes data
from,your blood and DNA
4521.21,to help you better
understand,your body
4522.92,and help you reach
your,health goals.
4524.72,I've long been a believer in
getting,regular blood work done
4527.33,for the simple reason that
many,of the factors that impact
4530.282,your immediate and
long-term,health
4531.74,can only be analyzed from
a,quality blood test.
4534.307,The problem with a lot of
blood,"and DNA tests out there,"
4536.64,"however, is that"
you,get data back
4538.73,"about metabolic factors, lipids,"
and,"hormones, and so forth."
4541.65,But you don't know what
to,do with those data.
4543.567,InsideTracker
solves,that problem
4545.12,and makes it very easy
for,you to understand
4547.31,"what sorts of nutritional,"
"behavioral,",maybe even
4550.94,supplementation-based
interventions,
4553.19,you might want to
take,on in order
4554.87,to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic,"factors, hormones,"
4557.57,"lipids, and other"
things,that impact
4559.25,your immediate and
long-term,health to bring
4561.32,those numbers into the
ranges,that are appropriate
4563.81,and indeed optimal for you.
4565.55,If you'd like to
try,"InsideTracker,"
4567.08,you can visit

4578.0,"Again, that's"

4580.97,and use the code
Huberman,at checkout.
4583.22,Super interesting little
subcellular,"goodies,"
4587.12,these mitochondria are.
4590.288,I come from a field where
people,are often divided
4593.54,into lumpers and splitters.
4595.19,And I'm somewhere in between.
4598.503,For those of you who
don't,"know, lumpers"
4600.17,are people that like to
make,things really simple--
4602.36,lists of no more than three
functions,or dividing brain
4605.63,areas into no more than three.
4607.138,Splitters are people
that,like to subdivide
4608.93,into a ton of detail.
4611.72,There's a history of scientists
being,splitters in order
4614.12,to be able to name things
after,themselves because--
4616.43,CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
4617.45,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
There's,more territory
4618.38,to go around if you're splitting
than,if you're lumping.
4620.87,But we are doing neither here.
4622.55,What I'm hearing is that
"mitochondria,",in addition
4627.23,to being important sources of
energy,production and output
4630.59,in cells--
4631.46,"which, of course, they are--"
4633.644,probably have other roles.
4637.22,"Maybe someday, what we call"
mitochondria,will actually
4641.3,be two or three different little
subcellular,or organelles.
4643.85,There may be little
bits,in there
4644.96,that are controlling gene
expression,and little bits
4647.127,in there that are controlling
neurotransmitter,production.
4649.7,"But at least for now,"
the,name is mitochondria.
4652.16,"And thank you, by the"
"way,",for illustrating
4654.56,some of the other things
that,they do because
4657.68,in the landscape of
science,"education,"
4660.23,"oftentimes, people will"
"think,","OK, energy production."
4662.737,There'll be a picture or
a,cartoon of mitochondria
4664.82,flexing its muscles.
4665.98,"People go, OK,"
"energy,","mitochondria,"
4667.73,mighty mitochondria.
4668.63,And then they'll
"think,","oh, they're"
4670.088,just sort of like a dumb
jock,portion of the cell.
4673.07,They're not doing
anything,sophisticated.
4674.96,And everything you
listed,off is that they
4676.73,are doing many sophisticated
intricate,things within cells.
4681.27,So I think how things are
cartooned,and discussed
4683.84,actually has an impact-- and
not,"just on the general public,"
4686.72,but on the medical field
and,on the science fields.
4689.24,"Anyway, that's more"
science,sociology.
4691.07,But now that everyone
is,well aware
4694.28,that mitochondria are doing a
large,number of very important
4697.79,"things in a very regulated way,"
let's,talk about mitophagy.
4702.08,"A few years ago, because a Nobel"
Prize,was given for autophagy--
4706.16,sometimes called autophagy.
4707.9,"Look, people, you can"
say,it either way.
4709.58,People will know hopefully what
it,"means is more important,"
4712.44,which is the gobbling
up,of one's own cells
4715.31,that are dead or injured.
4718.7,And this idea of
"autophagy,",of cells
4723.2,being eaten up within a system--
4726.23,nervous system or other system--
4728.36,has come up again and again.
4730.16,I actually wasn't aware
that,mitophagy could
4733.1,be such an important lever.
4734.72,"So tell us about mitophagy,"
which,I have to presume
4737.18,"is the, intentional or not,"
gobbling,"up of mitochondria,"
4743.6,presumably to replace them with
newer,healthier mitochondria.
4746.24,Is that right?
4746.72,CHRIS PALMER: It is.
4747.553,"So in many ways, mitophagy"
is,a subset of autophagy.
4752.99,But it's got its
own,name because it
4755.75,is specific to mitochondria.
4758.18,There do appear to be some
unique,regulators of mitophagy
4764.33,compared to autophagy
more,broadly.
4767.27,Mitochondria actually are
playing,a role in autophagy
4770.96,itself.
4773.0,And this makes sense because
one,of-- so the global picture
4776.69,of autophagy is stimulated
by,fasting states
4781.34,or fasting-mimicking states.
4783.47,So when your body senses that
you,"don't have enough food,"
4789.53,it actually hunkers
down,and starts
4792.95,to recycle dead old parts
in,this kind of carefully
4801.35,orchestrated way.
4802.88,And it takes them to lysosomes.
4805.22,They get degraded.
4806.18,And then those
degradation,products
4809.42,get used for either energy
or,to build new things.
4813.35,Autophagy is always
occurring,at a low level.
4817.4,But you can really
hyperstimulate,the process
4820.67,"through fasting,"
calorie,"restriction,"
4823.16,fasting-mimicking
"diets,",other things.
4825.69,And this is why fasting
and,calorie restriction
4828.68,is so kind of such hot topics
in,the medical field now.
4832.55,It's because they've been
shown,to induce longevity.
4836.12,And we think it's probably
through,that process
4839.03,that you're stimulating
the,body to kind of become
4846.41,lean and conservative in terms
of,its allocation of resources.
4853.4,And the body doesn't just
destroy,the healthiest tissue
4856.7,along with the old dead stuff.
4858.32,It has these processes that
identify,the old and defective
4861.89,parts first.
4862.88,And they go first.
4864.11,And that's what's beautiful
about,the whole thing.
4866.67,And that's why fasting
is,so important.
4869.52,So mitophagy we know plays a
really,important role because--
4878.9,so there's this term called
mitochondrial,"dysfunction,"
4882.885,which some researchers are
actually,wanting to get rid of
4885.26,and move away from
"because,","as you just said,"
4887.87,mitochondria do so
many,different things.
4889.91,And different mitochondria
even,within the same cell
4892.58,may very well be specializing
in,different tasks.
4895.67,And mitochondria from
one,cell to another
4897.56,are sometimes doing
very,"different things,"
4899.91,like not all mitochondria
can,produce cortisol.
4903.02,That's specific
to,specific cells
4907.22,where those genes are
getting,turned on.
4909.66,So it's not like
all,mitochondria
4911.21,are producing cortisol.
4912.32,Just the ones in your
adrenal,"gland, for instance,"
4915.5,are producing cortisol.
4918.53,But there is this term
mitochondrial,dysfunction.
4921.8,And it has long been
"known,","for decades,"
4926.48,that mitochondrial dysfunction
is,associated with everything
4931.61,that ails us essentially.
4934.6,"So in the 1950s, we"
had,a theory of aging
4941.66,that was based on
reactive,oxygen species.
4946.4,And that's where all
the,inflammation is bad
4948.32,for you comes from.
4949.34,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And where all
the,noise about antioxidants--
4954.77,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
4955.58,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Like,"in the '90s,"
4956.51,"it was like, it"
contains,antioxidants.
4958.25,Not to say antioxidants are
"bad,",but they are certainly not
4960.8,the be-all-end-all of health.
4962.055,CHRIS PALMER: They are not.
4963.18,But that's exactly where
that,"research came from,"
4965.81,is that researchers
were,narrowing
4968.27,in on these reactive oxygen
species,"are highly, highly"
4972.02,correlated with all of
the,diseases of aging
4976.4,and poor health outcomes.
4978.68,"It turns out, they're also"
"highly,",highly correlated
4981.68,with all chronic mental
disorders,interestingly.
4987.12,So researchers used
the,antioxidants
4989.31,"to see if, well,"
maybe,"if we can stop,"
4991.92,somehow tame these
reactive,"oxygen species,"
4994.3,we'll improve health outcomes.
4995.55,Doesn't seem to work.
4996.93,"By the 1970s, our"
understanding,of mitochondria
5000.41,and their role in the production
of,reactive oxygen species
5003.08,expanded.
5003.86,And that led to the
mitochondrial,theory of aging.
5006.95,"So in the 1970s, we had this"
mitochondrial,"theory of aging,"
5010.37,based primarily and exclusively
on,reactive oxygen species.
5015.77,Fast forward a
couple,"of decades,"
5017.39,that was disproven
because,we now reactive
5019.76,oxygen species aren't all bad.
5021.71,They actually serve
a,signaling process.
5024.02,They're a normal part
of,human functioning
5026.36,and cellular function.
5028.02,So they're not all bad.
5030.03,But we still know high levels
of,reactive oxygen species
5033.53,are bad for you.
5035.12,"Fast forward to just, I"
"think,","maybe last year,"
5039.32,with this expanded role of
all,of the different things
5042.08,mitochondria are doing.
5043.67,So David Sinclair
published,a paper
5047.48,in one of the cell
"journals,","I think,"
5050.21,"saying that, oh,"
mitochondria,are actually
5053.3,the unifying link of everything
that,we know about aging.
5057.11,Mitochondria are the cause--
5059.66,or defective mitochondria
or,defective mitochondrial
5062.63,"function, mitochondrial"
"dysfunction,",
5065.39,is possibly the
unifying,cause of aging
5070.1,and all of the aging
related,disorders.
5074.38,So mitophagy is trying
to,address all that.
5078.88,"It's trying to say,"
"OK,",this is bad.
5080.84,We don't want defective
mitochondria,and how can
5083.44,we get rid of old
ones,or defective ones
5086.935,and replace them with new ones.
5089.32,And I think the most
powerful,signal and tool
5096.15,"that we have right now is,"
in,"fact, related to diet."
5101.77,It's calorie restriction.
5103.54,"That is the oldest, truest, kind"
of,best-proven way to prevent
5111.34,aging in a wide variety
of,animal species--
5115.0,fasting and
intermittent,fasting.
5117.94,"And again, you can only do"
those,things for so long.
5121.03,And then fasting-mimicking
diets,can also
5125.23,stimulate this
process,of mitophagy.
5128.98,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we talk
about,"mitochondrial biogenesis,"
5133.33,if--
5134.71,and I certainly accept
the,idea that mitochondria
5138.01,are extremely important
in,physical health
5140.41,and mental health.
5141.37,"That's, for me, is a"
straightforward,conclusion
5144.94,"at this point, based"
on,"what you've said,"
5146.84,whatever and
"elsewhere,",et cetera.
5150.56,"And if various diets, including"
ketogenic,"diet, including"
5155.11,"fasting, reducing sugar"
"intake,","et cetera,"
5158.2,can assist in mitochondrial
function,and mitophagy--
5161.83,and that's at least one of
the,levers by which diet
5165.25,can positively impact mental
health,"and physical health,"
5170.01,can we conclude that
there's,something special
5173.01,about low blood
glucose,in the brain?
5176.995,The sort of common pathway of
all,"of those things-- fasting,"
5180.03,ketogenesis--
5181.71,"for some people, maybe they--"
5183.27,maybe some people have
great,"insulin management,"
5186.21,so just removing
"sweets,","refined sugars,"
5190.66,brings down their blood
glucose,level substantially.
5192.9,They don't need to go
on,a ketogenic diet
5194.37,in order to relieve a
low,level depression
5196.132,or something like that.
5197.09,Seems like the
common,theme here is
5199.62,that glucose levels
in,the brain need
5202.46,"to be reduced, which"
for,"me, is surprising"
5207.17,because neurons love glucose.
5210.392,There are some
really,nice studies.
5211.85,One that I can think
of,recently that
5213.44,was published in
"Neuron,",if you just
5214.94,"look at the tuning of a neuron,"
how,well a neuron in the brain
5218.75,represents some visual image
in,the environment in terms--
5222.578,"here, we can just"
generalize,"and say,"
5224.12,"more action potentials,"
more,electrical signals
5226.43,from the neuron
generally,correlates
5227.93,with better high
fidelity,representation.
5230.63,It's sort of if everyone's
time,"someone says, shout,"
5233.792,and then someone
"shouts,",the neuron
5235.25,is the one responding
to,the order.
5237.83,"And these neurons just,"
when,"there's high glucose,"
5240.14,they are faithful
representatives,
5242.48,of what's out
there,in the world.
5244.28,But then when you
fast,"an animal,"
5246.2,they become less
faithful,representatives
5248.24,of what's out there.
5249.38,And yet when I've done
intermittent,"fasting,"
5251.78,and I do a kind of
modified,"version of it,"
5253.67,my mental clarity is
far,better than when
5255.59,I've had a big bowl of pasta--
5257.15,probably for other
reasons,related
5259.37,to serotonin and tryptophan.
5261.65,So I think for the typical
listener,"out there,"
5264.932,"I have to imagine, it's got"
to,be a little confusing.
5267.14,We hear neurons love glucose.
5268.94,They live on glucose.
5270.89,"And here, we're saying, let's"
deprive,them of some glucose.
5274.04,Or let's just bring
glucose,levels down.
5276.17,Or let's switch the fuel source
of,the brain from glucose
5279.29,to ketones.
5280.7,And now the brain really works
the,way it's supposed to.
5283.98,So this raises a little bit
of,"just so story question,"
5286.55,like why would it be the case
that,"neurons love glucose,"
5291.56,and yet if there's too
much,"glucose around,"
5293.6,they become sick?
5295.76,"And of course, with any"
why-would-it-be,"story,"
5299.54,"as I would say, I wasn't"
consulted,at the design phase.
5302.005,And I'm going to
presume,that you
5303.38,weren't consulted the design--
5304.4,CHRIS PALMER: I was not.
5304.76,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --phase either.
5305.6,And that if any of
us,"say that we are,"
5307.183,then we are probably the
patients,that need evaluation.
5309.78,So I think there's
a,name for that.
5311.255,There's delusion--
5312.005,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
5312.26,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --right?
5312.53,OK.
5313.03,I threw out my first correct
clinical,assessment of myself.
5315.98,So how do I get my
head,around this?
5320.09,You've got me sold
on,mitochondria--
5321.702,not that I needed to be sold.
5322.91,"But that's an easy yes,"
"yes,","absolutely, yes."
5326.0,The idea that diet can
impact,mental health
5327.89,and physical health--
"yes,",absolutely--
5329.63,by way of mitochondria--
at,"least in part, great."
5333.23,But then neurons love glucose.
5335.39,So what's going on?
5336.98,Or what do you
think,is going on?
5340.63,CHRIS PALMER: I am not convinced
that,glucose is the real story.
5352.21,"Glucose may, in"
"fact,",be a symptom.
5358.26,We know that parts
of,the brain--
5360.84,there have been a couple of
studies,that just came out
5363.09,in the last couple
of,"weeks, I think,"
5365.91,documenting that actually
astrocytes,in the hypothalamus
5372.09,play a key role in glucose
regulation,throughout the body.
5379.68,And it appears to be a metabolic
"role,","which in my mind,"
5385.74,implies that the mitochondria
in,those astrocytes
5389.13,are probably playing a key role
because,we know mitochondria
5393.0,play a key role in
sensing,glucose levels.
5397.11,They play a key role in
the,release of insulin
5401.22,from the pancreas.
5403.89,But mitochondria in
the,brain is also
5408.18,playing a role in
kind,of balancing
5411.72,how much glucose is around.
5415.0,And so it's a difficult question
because,"I think in some cases,"
5422.55,high glucose levels
are,actually a symptom
5427.02,of metabolic dysfunction
somewhere,in the body or brain.
5431.65,"And when I think about,"
"well,",what does that mean?
5436.97,"In my mind, most of"
the,evidence currently
5440.66,is pointing to
mitochondrial,dysfunction
5443.99,somewhere in the body or brain.
5447.5,That is the most likely
cause,of that dysregulation
5451.58,of glucose levels.
5455.74,But we know that if you
consume,massive amounts
5461.29,"of junk food, sugar,"
and,"other things,"
5465.01,that you can get dysregulation
of,glucose levels.
5473.05,"The conundrum, though,"
is,that that's not
5475.5,a universal response.
5477.035,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what
about,the typical person?
5479.16,I've never really liked
junk,food that much.
5481.11,"Maybe as a kid, I can"
recall,liking candy.
5483.51,But I was a sandwich for
lunch,person for a long time.
5487.24,And as I've changed
that,out for salad
5490.26,and maybe a small piece of
meat,with my salad or something
5494.07,"like that, I feel far better"
during,"the day, far more alert."
5496.71,But I do eat carbohydrates.
5497.843,I eat starches
typically,at night.
5499.26,But I tend to do some very
hard,training at some point
5502.08,during the day.
5502.8,So I imagine I have
some,glycogen to repack.
5505.24,OK.
5505.74,That's me.
5506.43,I only mentioned that
because,I'm not in ketosis
5509.76,as far as I know.
5510.48,I haven't-- unless you
brought,"the strips,"
5512.37,I haven't done the blood
glucose,test today.
5516.82,So what about the
typical,person who's
5519.06,an omnivore eating some
"rice,","some pasta, pasta"
5524.46,"salads, people that are eating"
not,junk food massive amounts
5529.11,of sugar but have
blood,glucose that's
5531.57,in kind of moderate range?
5533.49,"Do you think-- and here,"
feel,free to speculate.
5536.43,Do you think that those
people,might feel far better--
5540.75,or even a little
bit,better-- if they
5542.52,were in a lower glucose state?
5546.79,And I ask this
because,I think there
5548.993,are a lot of people
out,there who suffer
5550.66,from full-blown depression.
5551.95,But there are also
a,lot of people
5553.367,who suffer from moodiness
and,"feeling not so great,"
5556.84,subclinical depression.
5558.285,"CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout"
is,what I would call it.
5560.41,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, or just"
feeling,"some days are great,"
5562.9,"and then other days, they"
feel,lousy for reasons
5565.27,they don't understand.
5566.35,CHRIS PALMER: Yeah.
5567.43,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And those make
for,less dramatic case studies.
5570.13,And yet I have to assume
that,that description will
5573.28,net a large fraction
of,the general public.
5577.77,CHRIS PALMER: So the way that
I,kind of break this field--
5582.23,and I'm probably getting
too,nerdy right now.
5584.33,But I kind of break
this,field into cause--
5588.01,what's the actual root cause--
5591.04,and what are
effective,treatments.
5594.4,And I really see them
as,two separate things.
5597.94,Just because the ketogenic
diet,"is an effective treatment,"
5603.01,does not imply that the
cause,of the problem
5606.46,was eating carbohydrates.
5608.98,And I think that's a really
important,distinction.
5612.29,There are many people who
disagree,with me on that.
5614.62,There's no doubt about it.
5615.95,And everybody's
heard,"people say,"
5617.74,sugar is the cause of
everything,that ails you.
5620.56,Or carbs are the cause of
everything,that ails you.
5622.87,If everybody does a low carb
diet,or a ketogenic diet--
5626.17,"and then they go to, so it must"
be,sugar that was the cause.
5631.69,I don't see it as clearly
black,and white as that.
5637.66,"Calorie restriction,"
ketogenic,"diet,"
5641.26,carbohydrate restriction are
inducing,metabolic changes
5646.84,in the brain and body.
5649.48,And regardless of what
the,"person was eating,"
5654.16,they are inducing
metabolic,changes
5656.44,that can be really
beneficial,to brain health.
5659.98,So let me just give a clear
black,and white example
5662.95,of this.
5664.12,And then I can speak
to,the broader topic
5666.49,that you brought up about
just,the general population.
5669.55,The easy example of
the,ketogenic diet
5672.31,being an effective
intervention,for somebody
5675.22,who was not following a bad
diet,is an infant with epilepsy.
5680.5,There are lots of infants who
have,uncontrollable seizures.
5684.82,They are drinking breast milk.
5687.28,To the best of our
"knowledge,",that
5688.9,"is the primary, most"
beneficial,food source
5693.34,an infant could be consuming.
5697.28,"Now, some might say, well,"
maybe,the mother is--
5699.97,"whatever, I don't buy that."
5702.41,"The mother's breast milk is, in"
"fact,",the optimal food source
5707.233,for that infant.
5707.9,And yet that infant
is,still seizing.
5710.3,If we put that infant
on,"a ketogenic diet,"
5712.73,a lot of those infants
seizures,will stop.
5715.94,It doesn't mean that the
cause,of the infant seizures
5719.21,was a bad diet.
5720.77,But it means that
dietary,intervention
5723.23,can change brain metabolism
and,improve symptoms
5727.43,in that person.
5729.81,So going to your broader
question,"about adults,"
5732.53,"modern-day, the real"
answer,is-- there was just
5737.61,this conference in
"London,",the Royal
5741.45,College of obesity medicine
or,something like that.
5744.847,That's not the name.
5745.68,But it's something
along,those lines.
5748.02,The conclusion of
that,conference
5752.83,that invited the greatest
minds,"in obesity medicine,"
5756.37,the overarching conclusion
of,that conference was we
5759.22,don't know what causes obesity.
5765.49,It's really important
that,we sit with that.
5768.47,We don't know what
causes,obesity.
5770.455,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
They,don't think
5771.83,excess caloric intake beyond
one's,daily metabolic needs
5776.24,is causing obesity?
5778.68,CHRIS PALMER: Some
will,argue that.
5780.75,"And so some will say yes,"
it's,all energy balance.
5784.67,But why do we have an
epidemic,of obesity?
5786.837,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.
5787.67,"Well, that's the"
N-gazillion,dollar question.
5791.735,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
5793.85,"Some will say, it's"
all,the junk food.
5795.44,But we had junk
food,in the 1970s.
5797.51,"When I was growing up, I grew"
up,"on Kool-Aid, and Twinkies,"
5801.23,"and King Dons, and HoHos, and--"
5803.69,[LAUGHS]
5804.548,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm rewatching
the,Mad Men series now.
5806.84,"I love that series,"
and,I'm rewatching it.
5808.59,And I happen to know someone
who,worked on that series.
5811.4,They researched
everything,"for the props,"
5813.588,"and the costumes, everything,"
right,down to diet.
5815.63,And if you look at the
"diet,",it was terrible.
5817.91,It was mostly--
"yes,",there was a lot
5819.41,of excessive amounts of
drinking,and cigarette smoking.
5821.72,But the diets were terrible.
5823.67,It was pre-packaged foods.
5825.29,It was frozen dinners.
5826.97,That really came to prominence
in,the '70s and '80s.
5829.88,"But even in the '50s and, from"
what,"I've been reading, even"
5834.5,in the '30s and
"'40s,",people were not
5838.46,eating grass-fed
meat,and Brazil nuts
5841.22,with a little bit of
broccoli,rabe on the side.
5843.95,That's not the typical intake.
5847.13,So something out there--
or,maybe multiple things--
5850.73,are at play to increase obesity.
5853.82,CHRIS PALMER: And at the
end,"of the day, I believe--"
5858.3,some will call this speculative.
5859.92,But I actually think we've got
a,tremendous amount of evidence
5862.62,that continues to point
in,this direction.
5865.38,I believe that
mitochondria,are the key
5867.99,to the obesity
"epidemic,",that there is
5870.87,something in our environment.
5874.51,"So that is either our food,"
environmental,"toxins, stress"
5879.63,"levels, poor sleep, not getting"
adequate,"sunlight, whatever"
5884.7,"you want to speculate on, all of"
the,"above, all of those things"
5890.96,are known to impair
mitochondrial,function.
5895.07,And if parts of your brain that
regulate,metabolism and that
5901.19,regulate eating behaviors are
not,"metabolically healthy,"
5907.1,it means that they will
not,stop you from eating.
5910.64,Or it means that your
metabolism,will not
5913.37,rise to the challenge
of,"10 donuts,"
5918.23,because some people
can,eat 10 donuts
5920.15,and go on staying
thin,and healthy.
5923.185,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I,totally agree.
5924.56,"Although, I would"
just,like to say
5926.6,that it seems to me that
compared,to when I was growing
5929.123,"up-- and again, I haven't"
run,the statistics--
5931.04,there are fewer and fewer of
those,individuals around now.
5933.8,"Just as when I was growing up,"
it,was one or two kids in class
5938.39,that were quite overweight.
5940.34,And then there were some
that,were mildly overweight.
5942.77,But most were of healthy weight.
5946.29,"Nowadays, that's"
dramatically,altered.
5948.6,The landscape is dramatically
altered,in the other direction.
5953.1,It is rare when I encounter one
of,those can-eat-anything type
5956.56,people.
5957.06,"I know one, he's actually"
an,employee at Stanford.
5959.05,He's in our media
team,at Stanford.
5960.508,"And this guy, when I take"
him,"to lunch, it's like--"
5964.18,he's in his early
"70s,",and he can eat.
5967.0,And he's incredibly lean.
5968.137,He exercises a little bit.
5969.22,But he's one of these mutants
that,"just can eat, and eat,"
5973.99,"and eat, and he's lean"
and,"he's vital, and he's--"
5976.975,it's wild.
5978.79,And he's an expensive lunch.
5980.62,CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
5982.36,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But those
people,are seem rare.
5985.22,And even those kids
are,now seem rare.
5987.57,CHRIS PALMER: They're
getting,increasingly rare.
5989.57,And that leads me
to,think it may
5991.67,be epigenetic factors
in,"the womb environment,"
5995.64,so that kids are actually coming
out,predisposed to obesity.
5999.268,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,"
let,me ask you about
6001.06,that because I had a note
here,to ask this later.
6003.04,But I'm going to
interrupt,you now in order
6004.832,to capture this moment.
6006.52,My understanding is that--
6008.8,"well, as everyone"
"knows,",we inherit DNA.
6010.63,We get genes from
both,of our parents.
6012.34,And they mix.
6012.94,Although there are incredible
data,from Catherine Dulac's
6015.79,lab at Harvard and others
showing,that we actually
6018.28,have entire regions
of,our brain that
6020.26,carry neurons that are of
purely,"of mom's or of dad's DNA,"
6026.51,depending on the brain region.
6027.76,This is a wild finding.
6029.5,But it's accurate.
6030.715,And this has actually been known
about,in terms of heritability
6033.34,"of disease, et cetera."
6036.34,"Maternal DNA, DNA from mom,"
genes,from our mother--
6040.75,not to place blame
on,mothers at all.
6044.14,My understanding is that
the,mitochondrial DNA
6046.32,come exclusively through
the,maternal side.
6048.81,Is that true?
6050.165,CHRIS PALMER: So it's
a,great question.
6051.79,And I've been asked this before.
6053.123,"And yeah, psychiatrists are"
known,for blaming mothers.
6056.16,And some might say that I'm
trying,to redo that whole thing
6059.85,and blame mothers again.
6061.735,ANDREW HUBERMAN: The
data,are the data.
6063.36,I'm not trying to
blame,mothers here.
6064.902,Mothers play an essential
role,in everything.
6068.89,But if it is true
that,mitochondria
6071.97,are the linchpin of all this and
maternal,DNA is what determines
6074.79,"the mitochondrial DNA, I"
think,it's an important place
6077.04,to look.
6077.43,CHRIS PALMER: It's an
important,question.
6079.138,And the answer is
unequivocally,no.
6081.48,That's not the way it works.
6082.65,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,"
then,vindication for anyone
6084.75,that was asserting that.
6085.81,CHRIS PALMER: And so
let,me explain it.
6087.435,So mitochondria have 36
genes,unto themselves.
6091.05,13 of those genes code for some
of,the mitochondrial machinery
6095.28,of making ATP.
6096.51,And the other 36 play roles
in,"epigenetic regulation,"
6101.82,play roles in whole body
"metabolism,",and other things.
6105.84,So that is what you're
inheriting,from your mom.
6108.72,It's the mitochondria and those
36,genes for the most part.
6114.24,But the majority of proteins
that,"make up mitochondria,"
6119.49,"over, I think, 1,300 genes"
that,make up mitochondria
6123.18,are actually encoded
in,the nuclear DNA.
6126.84,And so you inherit a copy
from,both your mother
6129.81,and your father.
6131.01,So the majority of people who
have,mitochondrial defects
6134.64,or rare mitochondrial
diseases,actually
6139.05,could inherit them
from,either mom or dad
6142.47,because it can be a defect in
the,nuclear genes that code
6148.59,for proteins that
make,up mitochondria.
6152.11,The much bigger issue when--
6154.54,so when I talk about
mitochondrial,dysfunction
6158.11,being a primary driver of mental
"illness,","metabolic illness,"
6165.08,it's not that people inherit
a,defective mitochondrion
6170.12,or mitochondria
from,"mom, and then"
6173.84,that just ruins
their,life forever.
6176.09,That's actually not
the,way it works.
6178.53,The beautiful thing
about,this theory
6182.06,is that it connects
all,of the risk factors
6185.12,that we already know play
a,role in mental health
6189.9,but also metabolic health.
6192.21,Sleep disruption impairs
mitochondria,and mitochondrial
6196.59,function.
6197.67,"Stress, high levels"
of,"stress and trauma,"
6200.37,impair mitochondrial function.
6202.65,"Drug and alcohol use,"
"alcohol,",tobacco definitely--
6208.65,in terms of the smoke--
6210.15,"and marijuana-- THC, in"
particular--,all impair
6214.53,mitochondrial function.
6215.88,ANDREW HUBERMAN: THC
directly,or the smoke?
6219.48,CHRIS PALMER: THC directly.
6220.83,Those studies have been done.
6224.07,So mitochondria actually have
CB1,receptors right on them.
6229.17,And various
"researchers,",a couple
6232.92,of studies from Nature
actually,documented
6235.92,"this, that the mitochondrial"
CB1,receptors are primary--
6244.74,kind of primary points of
the,influence of marijuana
6248.64,on human behaviors and effects.
6253.44,Because when they remove CB1
receptors,"in animal models,"
6257.69,these changes don't happen.
6260.04,So the CB1 receptors--
6263.28,we've got some large
studies,of adolescents
6265.86,who use a lot of marijuana.
6267.57,And the areas where the
mitochondria,have the greatest
6270.87,number of CB1 receptors
are,areas of their brains
6274.5,that actually are atrophied
or,shrunk compared
6279.18,to normal healthy controls.
6280.96,So that means their brain
tissue,is aging prematurely.
6283.92,It's shrinking prematurely.
6287.49,But the CB1 receptors
on,mitochondria
6290.19,also seem to play a role in
the,memory impairment that
6293.22,can be induced from THC.
6296.97,And they also play
a,role in the kind
6301.17,"of lack of motivation, the"
behavioral,amotivational state
6305.76,from THC.
6307.56,"Now, again, for people"
who,"want to chillax,"
6311.22,that's what they're looking for.
6312.99,They don't want to
remember,anything.
6314.76,They don't want to think.
6316.98,They want to be spaced out.
6318.57,They want to relax.
6320.4,That's great.
6322.92,But it's important
that,they know
6324.63,that they're actually harming
the,mitochondria in their brain
6327.81,cells.
6329.76,And that although there's
always,an opportunity
6334.14,to repair mitochondria
and,always an opportunity
6337.02,to stimulate
mitochondrial,"biogenesis,"
6339.31,"so you can get it back, but if"
you,"keep doing it chronically,"
6342.57,you're probably not helping
your,overall mental or metabolic
6346.58,health.
6347.08,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm"
glad,you brought up THC.
6348.6,We did an episode on cannabis.
6349.92,We also did one on alcohol--
6351.69,probably lost some
friends,from that one.
6354.158,When you look at the
"data,",it's very clear.
6355.95,I'm not arguing
that,people dislike
6358.56,the effects of these
compounds,when they take them.
6361.98,But it is clear
"that,","at least to me,"
6365.19,based on the data that
regardless,of what people
6367.26,"have read about red wine, that"
not,drinking any alcohol is
6369.747,going to be healthier
than,"drinking alcohol,"
6371.58,and that the thresholds for
alcohol,ingestion before people
6374.13,start to negatively
impact,their health
6375.755,is about one or two per week.
6377.4,"And then THC, because of"
the,very high concentrations
6380.01,of THC that are present
in,a lot of products now--
6383.09,vaping and smoking
THC,and even edibles--
6386.0,that it can be problematic.
6388.115,You mentioned adolescents
that,"predisposition,"
6390.65,"and brain atrophy,"
"psychosis,",et cetera.
6392.93,"In any case, because"
you,mentioned alcohol
6396.35,because it is a
commonly,"used substance,"
6400.34,I heard you give
a,talk in which--
6402.59,I think I have this right--
in,which alcohol can disrupt
6408.25,the way that the brain
uses,"fuels of all kinds,"
6412.49,which may disrupt one's
response,"to alcohol,"
6418.0,make alcohol seem more rewarding
to,those that drink alcohol.
6423.915,So drinking alcohol
makes,alcohol
6425.29,more rewarding to the
brains,"of alcohol drinkers,"
6429.76,but that it also might
alter,"glucose metabolism,"
6432.67,that basically alcohol is
not,good for our brains.
6436.84,Do I have that correct?
6437.86,CHRIS PALMER: You do
have,that correct.
6439.485,ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
6441.23,What happens if you take an
alcoholic,or somebody that just
6444.71,drinks two to four
nights,a week a couple
6448.28,"of drinks, which I think"
is,"pretty common out there,"
6451.28,and you put them on
a,ketogenic diet?
6453.68,Has that experiment been done?
6455.27,CHRIS PALMER: That
experiment,has been done.
6457.103,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah.
6458.653,CHRIS PALMER: It
led,by none other
6460.07,than a woman named
Nora,"Volkow, who"
6462.32,is one of the leading
neuroscientists,and addiction
6466.25,researchers in the world.
6467.76,She is the director of
the,National Institute
6469.85,of Drug Abuse.
6471.14,She's been hot on the trail
of,metabolic abnormalities
6474.86,in the brains of people with
alcohol,"use disorder, which"
6478.01,I will just refer
to,as alcoholics
6480.17,because that's what
everybody,knows it as.
6482.96,So she's been hot on this
trail,"for many, many years."
6487.79,"And as you said, it turns"
out,"that the reward pathways,"
6493.67,"in particular, are metabolically"
compromised,in alcoholics.
6497.75,And the metabolic compromise
"essentially,","in a nutshell,"
6500.57,means they aren't getting
enough,fuel from glucose.
6503.99,The interesting thing is that
when,"people drink alcohol,"
6507.89,your liver converts alcohol
into,a molecule called acetate.
6512.15,That acetate travels up to the
brain,"and fuels brain cells,"
6516.98,"in particular, some"
of,these reward
6518.75,pathway cells more than others.
6521.04,And so chronic alcoholics
have,this chronic deprivation
6527.0,of energy in these cells.
6529.59,And so Nora Volkow and other
researchers,at the National
6532.94,Institutes of Health did a
study,in which they set out
6538.58,to see if we can change
this,brain metabolic problem
6543.32,in alcoholics.
6544.79,Will that affect clinical
symptoms,of alcoholism?
6548.66,And will it do anything?
6551.255,It's clinically useful.
6553.41,And so they actually
did,a pilot randomized
6557.51,"controlled trial, admitted"
alcoholics,to a detox unit.
6562.02,Half of the patients
got,a ketogenic diet.
6564.5,The other half got the
standard,American diet.
6567.26,And then everybody
"else,",all of them
6569.21,got the same detox protocol.
6571.98,The patients who got
the,ketogenic diet
6575.37,required fewer benzodiazepines
for,their detox.
6580.14,"Despite that, they had"
fewer,withdrawal symptoms
6584.4,from the alcohol.
6585.99,They reported fewer
cravings,for alcohol.
6590.49,And the researchers
did,"brain scans,"
6593.11,which showed improved brain
metabolism,in these key areas
6598.02,that they were looking at.
6600.39,And their brains
showed,reduced levels
6603.51,"of neuroinflammation,"
which,was also something
6606.84,they were really interested in.
6609.19,And so that one study says to
us,that even though most people
6616.38,would think alcoholism has
nothing,"to do with diet,"
6619.8,alcohol is just
drinking,too much.
6622.08,It's a matter of willpower.
6624.18,Or it's somebody
who's,addictive.
6625.67,They've got an
addictive,"personality,"
6627.81,and it's that simple.
6629.38,You come out of the womb with
an,addictive personality.
6632.31,And those people are novelty
"seekers,",and they're impulsive.
6637.89,And they have no patience.
6639.42,They have no discipline.
6640.71,They can't sustain any kind
of,rewarding experience.
6645.45,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or
childhood,trauma.
6647.67,There's a--
6648.21,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
6648.63,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: --story there,"
which,there very well may be.
6651.15,But--
6651.54,CHRIS PALMER: And there may be.
6652.38,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
6653.58,CHRIS PALMER: But what that
research,study strongly
6656.52,suggests--
6657.81,"and again, yes, maybe we need"
larger,controlled trials.
6661.29,But this is one of the leading
neuroscientists,in the world
6663.78,who's hot on this trail.
6664.83,This is what she believes.
6666.09,And this is what I believe.
6668.25,It's that if we can correct
the,brain metabolic defects
6671.82,from chronic alcohol
"use,",we might
6674.49,be able to help people be
sober,and give them a fighting
6679.11,chance.
6679.68,Or give them an edge
up,or pull a lever
6682.98,that we can use in their
"favor,",for their benefit.
6687.66,There's one caution to
all,of this research
6689.58,that I really do
want,to highlight.
6691.3,"And so now, I'm going"
to,get hate mail
6693.24,from all the keto community.
6695.34,ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's OK.
6696.81,I admire you for talking
about,nutrition at all
6698.97,because anytime one
talks,"about nutrition,"
6701.58,you're going to get
hate,mail from somebody.
6704.52,CHRIS PALMER: So the
caveat,to all of this
6707.91,is that as part of the research
that,those researchers were
6712.77,"doing, they actually"
wanted,to see
6715.26,what will happen
to,alcohol levels
6719.64,if an animal consumes alcohol
while,on a ketogenic diet.
6726.1,So they didn't do
this,in humans yet.
6728.22,This is a fairly
easy,study to do.
6730.29,So I'm hoping somebody
will,do this study soon.
6732.87,But they instead put
rats,half of them
6736.44,on a standard diet and half
of,them on a ketogenic diet.
6739.175,And then they exposed them
to,the exact same amount
6741.3,of alcohol.
6742.8,The rats who were on
the,ketogenic diet
6745.11,had a five-fold increase
in,blood alcohol levels.
6749.84,Five-fold increase.
6750.82,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Meaning,",they drank more?
6752.57,Or--
6752.9,CHRIS PALMER: No.
6753.11,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --it was
metabolized,differently.
6754.73,CHRIS PALMER: It was
metabolized,differently.
6756.605,The rats all got the
same,amount of alcohol.
6759.3,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people
out,"there who are ketogenic,"
6762.59,"I'm chuckling, but who are"
not,"alcoholics-- please,"
6764.763,"alcoholics, please"
do,something about it
6766.43,because it's so detrimental.
6767.597,But I guess does this mean that
they,can drink less in order
6770.66,to get the effect of alcohol
that,most people are seeking?
6773.3,CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates.
6774.56,Cheap date is what
you,call that.
6776.3,You only need a half a drink
instead,of three drinks.
6778.858,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I would think
the,keto community would thank
6781.4,you for this unless they somehow
have,a stake in the alcohol
6784.67,industry.
6787.047,CHRIS PALMER: The
reason,that I put it
6788.63,as a caution is that if anybody
is,struggling with alcoholism
6792.32,"and thinks hey, I"
need,an edge up.
6794.33,I need a lever to pull
because,I'm really struggling
6796.94,to give this stuff up.
6798.47,I just find myself going back.
6800.27,And if you're telling me my
brain,"metabolism is messed up,"
6803.39,"and this might help it,"
I'm,all in favor of that.
6807.56,"And yes, that's what the"
researchers,are pursuing.
6809.9,And that's what I'm saying
with,the following caveat--
6814.07,that if you relapse while
on,"a ketogenic diet,"
6817.7,you better not drink the
same,amount of alcohol
6820.4,that you think you can drink.
6822.99,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It,could be deadly.
6824.49,CHRIS PALMER: It
could,"be deadly,"
6826.01,and/or it could be really--
6828.41,"yeah, deadly to you or someone"
else,"because unfortunately,"
6831.47,a lot of times
when,"people drink,"
6833.21,they get behind the wheel.
6834.8,And they think that they can
handle,two drinks safely.
6838.28,"And they think, well,"
I,can go out for dinner
6840.83,and have two glasses of
wine,and drive home safely.
6844.1,I know myself.
6845.48,If you go to a
ketogenic,"diet, please"
6848.93,don't drive with
the,same two drinks
6851.54,because it means your
blood,alcohol level--
6854.36,if it models anything that
we,found in the rat study--
6858.08,your blood alcohol levels
may,be five times higher
6860.72,than they would normally be.
6862.32,And that means you
are,really wasted.
6865.13,And you're probably
not,safe to be driving.
6866.922,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Probably,the same
6868.338,is true for drinking on
an,"empty stomach, right?"
6870.35,CHRIS PALMER: Yup.
6870.62,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
6871.537,"Now, it's a very"
important,point.
6872.96,And thank you for raising that.
6875.21,I hear this again
about,"mitochondria,"
6880.97,"about blood glucose, you"
mentioned,astrocytes.
6884.09,And for those of you--
6885.65,that earlier astrocytes
are,a non-neuron cell type
6888.83,"in the brain, a glial cell type"
that,my postdoc advisor was
6893.6,known for popularizing the
modern,"science of glia,"
6896.638,which include astrocytes.
6897.68,And I'd be remiss if I didn't
say,that they are considered
6902.27,the cells that hold everything
together,in the brain
6904.64,and are kind of
passive,observers.
6906.29,But they do many
things,actively.
6909.41,I think now people appreciate
the,astrocytes at least
6913.04,as important as the neurons.
6915.07,"And certainly, for"
"disease,",they are often
6916.82,implicated in warding off
of,"disease, et cetera."
6920.76,Everything that you're
telling,me about the fact
6922.76,that the brain can regulate
things,that are happening
6924.98,"in the body, metabolism, et"
"cetera,","organ health, obesity,"
6928.91,"et cetera, to me,"
as,"a neuroscientist,"
6930.74,that's not surprising.
6932.15,All of it just screams
"hypothalamus,","hypothalamus,"
6935.075,hypothalamus because
"here,","you're telling me,"
6936.95,it's regulating these basal
functions,like metabolism.
6940.4,It's regulating how
much,we crave things.
6942.92,"And of course,"
hypothalamus,is involved
6944.84,in motivation and craving.
6946.04,"There are other areas, too--"
6947.542,other areas of the
"brain,","too, of course."
6949.25,But I would imagine
that,someone ought to
6953.03,or has mapped out where the
receptors,for all this business
6959.55,are in the brain.
6962.13,And I guess that raises
the,"question of, when"
6964.38,one goes on a ketogenic or low
blood,"glucose diet or fast,"
6970.32,has anyone observed
changes,in the brain?
6972.39,Has anyone had neuroimaging
of,humans and their brains
6976.59,under conditions of ingesting
one,"diet or another,"
6979.38,whether or not
they're,psychiatric--
6980.97,suffering from a
psychiatric,disorder or not?
6984.12,I would think that's
where,the gold is.
6986.49,CHRIS PALMER: We do have
some,of those studies.
6991.845,When you do a
neuroimaging,"study,"
6993.51,you can measure a lot
of,different things.
6995.26,So one thing with
a,"PET scan, you"
6997.32,can measure glucose metabolism.
6999.49,"So a researcher,"
Stephen,Cunnane is
7002.39,doing that research in
particular,in Alzheimer's
7005.42,disease patients and Alzheimer's
disease,models but in humans.
7011.12,And that's because
we,know that--
7015.47,"again, a common"
finding,in patients
7018.41,with Alzheimer's disease is
this,"glucose hypometabolism,"
7022.83,some people are
attributing,it to insulin
7025.82,signaling impairment.
7027.26,And so some people are
calling,it type III diabetes.
7030.26,"At the end of the day,"
I,think the clearest
7033.68,signal that we
have,is that cells
7036.14,aren't getting enough energy
from,glucose as a fuel source.
7039.95,That is something that I
think,I can confidently
7042.98,say that's backed by
numerous,research studies.
7046.67,There's debate in
the,research field
7048.26,about whether that's a
primary,driver of the illness.
7051.68,I happen to believe it is.
7053.48,And if you ask the
"question,","well,"
7055.56,why would cells not be getting
enough,fuel from glucose?
7059.03,You have to focus
on,mitochondria
7060.71,because they're
the,ones producing
7062.18,the fuel from that glucose.
7064.08,So you somehow you have
to,implicate mitochondria
7066.44,in that process
one,way or another.
7069.83,"Others will say, no, that's"
just,a side effect of whatever's
7073.31,causing Alzheimer's disease.
7075.44,So Stephen Cunnane has
done,studies where he even
7077.72,gives ketone supplements.
7079.82,ANDREW HUBERMAN: These
are,liquid ketone esters?
7081.89,"CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone"
esters,or ketone salts.
7084.74,And it has actually found that
these,brain metabolism deficits
7090.05,"can be corrected,"
at,"least short-term,"
7093.41,by giving a ketone supplement.
7096.138,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is this
in,the context of people
7098.18,also ingesting
some,carbohydrate?
7099.95,"Because I confess, I've"
tried,the ketogenic diet.
7103.64,I probably did it wrong.
7104.768,This was years ago.
7105.56,And then the cyclic
ketogenic,diet.
7107.09,But in the last year
or,"so, I've started"
7110.87,using liquid ketone esters.
7113.36,And I do eat some
carbohydrates,"each day,"
7116.33,usually in proportion to how
much,high intensity exercise
7119.6,I'm doing.
7122.05,Those liquid ketone
"esters,",for me--
7125.14,at least subjectively--
I,feel greatly
7127.45,increase my energy levels and
my,ability to focus mentally.
7131.53,And they improve my sleep.
7133.06,This is my observation
tracking,some data
7135.61,"but just, again, subjectively."
7137.32,"So in this example,"
are,you talking
7139.39,about people taking
ketone,esters or ketone
7141.58,salts on a backdrop
of,a ketogenic diet
7144.82,or on the backdrop of
a,more typical diet?
7147.88,CHRIS PALMER: So he's done both.
7149.98,So he's done studies where
patients,aren't doing
7154.66,anything special with the diet.
7156.08,So they're eating
whatever,they normally
7157.747,"eat, absolutely"
"nonketogenic,",giving them
7160.9,"a ketone salt or ester,"
and,then noticing
7164.62,immediate and direct
changes,in the metabolism
7168.16,of these metabolically
compromised,brain cells
7173.41,as measured by PET imaging.
7176.063,ANDREW HUBERMAN: These are not
household,"pets, by the way."
7178.48,"Sorry, I have--"
we,have to just--
7180.01,"P-E-T, positron emission"
"tomography,",not pets.
7182.277,"Although, I'm sure that"
there,are people out there
7184.36,"who have their dogs,"
or,"cats, or whatever,"
7186.49,"or their pet kangaroos,"
whatever,"you might own,"
7189.25,on ketogenic diet.
7190.29,OK.
7190.878,CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
7191.92,So he's actually moved further.
7193.93,He's done a pilot
trial,in a nursing home
7196.12,"actually, where he did"
not,put the patients
7198.76,on a ketogenic diet.
7200.32,He simply reduced
carbohydrate,consumption
7204.43,at breakfast and lunch.
7206.89,They still got the same
dinner,as everyone else.
7209.8,And simply reducing
carbohydrate,consumption
7212.68,at breakfast and lunch resulted
in,cognitive improvement
7216.79,in a statistically significant
way,in some of those subjects.
7220.755,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, I love"
that,"result. I'm sorry,"
7222.88,I just have to highlight this.
7224.13,I'm a huge believer in
directing,carbohydrates
7227.53,to specific portions
of,the day when
7229.18,one needs to be less
focused,and alert
7231.97,and yet can replenish glycogen.
7235.33,Limiting carbohydrates most
of,"the time during the day,"
7238.75,"for me, has been a game"
changer,in terms of maintaining
7241.96,"alertness, et cetera."
7242.92,I'm not aware that I have
age-related,cognitive decline.
7245.89,"But then again, I would-- people"
around,me may argue otherwise.
7248.875,"CHRIS PALMER: Let me say,"
you,are Andrew Huberman.
7250.96,There is no way you have
[LAUGHS],cognitive impairment.
7253.96,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Although
you,didn't know me
7254.62,as a six-year-old--
7254.83,CHRIS PALMER: If you have
cognitive,"impairment,"
7256.36,we're all screwed.
7257.5,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Well,",I have plenty
7259.0,of flaws and impairments--
well,"over 3,000"
7261.07,documented by people
very,close to me.
7265.37,But this is very
"interesting,","I think,"
7267.272,in the context of everything
we've,been talking about
7269.48,because could it be
that,supplementing
7272.81,with liquid ketones
or,prescribing
7276.53,liquid ketones to people
who,are challenged with mood
7281.42,disorders-- or things of that
sort--,"could be beneficial,"
7284.24,even if they are not
willing,or able to adhere
7287.63,to a ketogenic diet?
7288.738,CHRIS PALMER: That is the
million,dollar question
7290.78,right now.
7291.35,And we don't have good
trial,data to say yes or no.
7299.06,"My speculation, my hunch,"
having,tried that clinically
7303.86,"with patients, is it"
doesn't,seem to work.
7308.4,It's not the same thing.
7312.01,The bigger reason for my
feeling,confident in saying that
7316.87,is that we've had
ketone,salts and esters
7320.68,available for over a decade now.
7324.64,We have tens of thousands of
children,and adolescents who
7328.33,"are following a strict,"
ridiculously,"strict, ketogenic"
7332.53,diet to control their epilepsy.
7336.03,Those kids would love to
be,off the ketogenic diet.
7339.84,Their parents would love to have
them,off the ketogenic diet.
7343.255,ANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no
birthday,"cake, no ice cream."
7345.63,CHRIS PALMER: There
is,not one case report
7349.26,of any child controlling
his,or her seizures using
7353.79,exogenous ketones without
also,doing the ketogenic diet.
7359.53,I just find it hard to
believe,that at least some
7363.1,of those people haven't
tried,it out to see.
7366.58,I do know some patients
with,bipolar disorder
7370.27,and even schizophrenia who
are,doing extraordinarily well
7375.49,on a ketogenic diet.
7377.35,They have tried to switch
off,the ketogenic diet using
7381.07,exogenous ketones.
7382.72,Their symptoms came back.
7384.89,And so they found that
it,just wasn't effective.
7388.49,"Now, again, those are anecdotes."
7391.61,My scientific
speculation,about why
7395.24,is because the ketogenic diet is
actually,not necessarily about
7401.4,ketones themselves.
7403.86,Ketones are one of a
multifaceted,story there.
7408.16,And so when people
do,"a ketogenic diet,"
7411.96,they're also improving--
they're,lowering glucose levels.
7415.35,They're improving
insulin,signaling.
7418.65,They're ramping up mitochondrial
"biogenesis,","in particular,"
7423.81,in the liver because
mitochondria,actually
7427.65,make ketones.
7429.24,That's where they're made.
7430.35,And they're primarily made
in,the liver mitochondria.
7433.72,So when somebody is
on,in a fasting state
7436.68,"or on a ketogenic diet,"
their,liver mitochondria
7440.79,go through the roof because
they're,being called to action.
7444.42,"It's like, hey, body's"
in,starvation mode.
7447.03,Get to work.
7448.09,And so the mitochondria--
7450.18,the cell senses we need
more,mitochondria to process
7454.02,fat to turn it into ketones so
that,those ketones can get up
7457.53,to the brain and keep
the,"brain fueled,"
7459.9,because fatty acids
can't,fuel the brain.
7463.5,Only ketones can.
7465.78,"Now, so my sense is that--"
and,the gut microbiome changes
7470.94,"and everything, the"
changes,in hormones--
7472.93,so if you're eating
a,lot of donuts
7476.94,and drinking a
bottle,"of ketones,"
7479.49,the donuts are going
to,prevent your body
7482.79,from lowering glucose levels.
7484.598,You're still going to
have,the high glucose
7486.39,levels from the donuts.
7487.512,You're still going
to,probably have
7488.97,the impaired insulin signaling.
7490.89,You're probably still
going,to possibly
7493.59,have some inflammation from
the,inflammatory effects
7497.19,of that food.
7499.62,And so just drinking ketones
alone,won't be enough.
7505.41,I think for people who are
metabolically,"healthy, I'll"
7509.37,"include you in that, I think"
ketones,can play a really
7512.67,"beneficial role, no doubt."
7515.01,I think exogenous
ketones,"may, in fact,"
7519.75,proven valuable in
clinical,use for patients
7524.13,who maybe can't follow a
super,strict ketogenic diet
7526.77,but maybe could do
a,low carb diet.
7529.403,And then given the
research,that's
7530.82,happening with
alcohol,"use disorder,"
7534.17,I could imagine a
situation--,here's
7536.36,the million dollar
tip,to whoever
7539.84,"wants to go out and get this,"
if,it actually turns out
7542.09,to be true.
7543.6,I could imagine a scenario
where,we use exogenous ketones
7547.25,with alcoholics.
7548.78,And that every time they have
a,"severe craving for alcohol,"
7552.08,they drink ketones instead.
7554.34,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which sort
of,tastes like alcohol.
7556.54,"The ketone esters, when I take"
"them,",I drink them straight.
7560.162,Sometimes I'll put
them,in seltzer.
7561.62,And I'm not a big
"drinker,",as I mentioned.
7563.37,I might have an alcoholic
drink,every once in a while.
7565.7,I just don't ever crave it.
7567.11,I just do it every maybe--
7570.47,I think 2020 was the last
time,I had a drink of alcohol.
7574.31,"So obviously, I'm not a"
good,representative example.
7577.55,But the ketones
taste,good to me.
7579.83,And they obviously
don't,get you drunk.
7582.56,They do seem to flick on my
alertness,pretty quickly.
7588.11,My understanding is that they
are,the brain's preferred fuel
7592.52,source.
7593.49,"Meaning, they are going"
to,be the first fuels used
7596.9,by the brain when there's a
buffet,of fuels available.
7603.818,If there's glucose
in,"my bloodstream,"
7605.36,there's circulating
liquid,"ketones,"
7607.49,the ketones would be used
first,or preferentially.
7610.4,Is that true?
7612.12,CHRIS PALMER: I think
it's,a complex question.
7617.015,Some research that we have
suggest,that there are brain
7620.93,areas or brain cells that
require,glucose and cannot use
7626.27,ketones.
7627.51,So 100% of the brain cannot
be,fueled with ketones as far
7631.58,as we can tell.
7632.81,So there are some areas
that,require glucose.
7636.71,And that's probably the
reason,we have gluconeogenesis
7639.56,to keep the body going and keep
the,brain going no matter what.
7645.57,"But when ketones are available,"
especially,"if ketones are high,"
7652.66,the way I think about
it,is not that ketones
7655.9,are the preferred fuel
source,and glucose
7658.45,goes to the wayside.
7660.7,But the way I think
about,it is that you
7662.8,have a range of
cells,with varying
7666.16,degrees of metabolic health.
7668.86,And some of those
cells,are going
7670.24,to be extraordinarily healthy
with,appropriate healthy
7674.83,abundant mitochondria.
7677.21,And those cells
are,probably going
7678.82,to continue to use
glucose,as a fuel source.
7682.22,But if ketones
happen,"to be there,"
7683.89,"sure, they'll use that, too."
7685.3,Why not?
7686.89,But the real money
is,metabolically
7689.14,"compromised tissues,"
whether,it's
7692.23,brain cells or
other,tissues that--
7695.13,we're talking about the brain.
7696.38,So if you've got metabolically
compromised,brain cells--
7699.76,because it's not
across,the board.
7701.44,Like with Alzheimer's
brain,"scans,"
7703.93,there are specific regions
that,are more metabolically
7706.9,compromised than others.
7708.35,And that's why we see patterns
of,atrophy in specific brain
7712.81,regions.
7713.68,It's because those regions are
dysfunctional,metabolically
7718.63,for whatever reason.
7720.1,And we can get into
why,that might be.
7723.97,But my sense is that if you've
got,a metabolically compromised
7727.21,"cell, that cell is sending"
out,a distress signal.
7730.96,That cell is calling resources
from,"the body, like feed me."
7737.35,Give me something.
7739.03,And if it can't use
glucose,"effectively,"
7741.58,it is going to suck
up,those ketones
7744.1,and then start running on all
cylinders,or closer to it.
7749.38,And that process is so
critical,because what it means
7755.17,is that if that cell
was,barely getting
7759.58,by on 60% of its
real,"ATP requirement,"
7765.19,it means that it doesn't have
enough,energy for maintenance
7768.34,and repair functions.
7770.74,As soon as you give that
cell,a hundred percent energy
7774.19,"or close to it, even"
if,you get it up
7776.77,to 90% of its preferred
energy,"amount,"
7782.74,it can start to repair itself.
7786.01,That's the beauty
of,the human body
7787.84,"in living organisms,"
is,that they
7789.94,have a priority list of
what,they're going to do.
7795.325,If that cell senses that
there,"are defective molecules,"
7800.2,defective proteins
in,this cell that
7803.17,"need to be replaced,"
once,"it gets enough fuel,"
7807.61,it will start repairing
itself,and doing that work.
7811.963,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That,makes sense.
7813.38,Thank you for that
clarification.,
7817.463,I'd like to talk
about,Alzheimer's
7818.88,and age-related cognitive
decline,generally.
7822.36,I know many people
out,there are just
7825.3,terrified of losing their
memory,for the obvious reasons.
7829.32,"Memory sets context, et cetera."
7831.48,And many people
have,relatives that
7834.51,suffer from Alzheimer's or
other,forms of dementia.
7837.75,I've heard that the
ketogenic,diet and diets like
7841.86,it can be very
effective,for helping
7846.12,to offset some of the
symptoms,of Alzheimer's
7848.88,and age-related
cognitive,decline.
7850.51,"In fact, I even have a friend"
I,"won't out by institution,"
7854.22,who's the chair of
"Cardiology,","who contacted me,"
7857.88,"of all people, asking whether or"
not,I was aware of any studies
7863.28,or whether or not I knew of
anybody,who had benefited from
7867.42,ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's.
7868.868,"And I thought, well, why don't"
you,ask one of your colleagues
7871.41,in neurology?
7872.22,But his response was
really,interesting.
7874.57,He said there are many books out
there,for the general public.
7878.46,There are a lot of online
discussions,about this.
7880.832,There are a lot of
assertions,"about this,"
7882.54,and some animal studies.
7885.26,"Again, these are his words."
7887.92,"There are very few, if any,"
controlled,clinical trials
7892.47,exploring the role
of,the ketogenic diet
7895.17,for the treatment or
reversal,of Alzheimer's
7898.17,and age-related
cognitive,decline.
7899.76,I'm hoping that statement
was,incorrect or soon will be
7902.7,incorrect-- because those
trials,are ongoing--
7904.92,"but he said, yeah, the people"
are,most popular for telling us
7910.59,about the important role
and,positive role of being
7914.67,"in ketosis for Alzheimer's,"
for,"some reason,"
7917.22,they just won't do
a,clinical trial.
7919.51,And that's been frustrating
to,the community.
7922.36,"So this is a very educated,"
very,accomplished person
7925.11,who's a physician of
heart,medicine as opposed
7928.44,to something else
related,to the brain.
7932.26,But what is the story there.
7935.28,"And for goodness' sake, why"
aren't,there clinical trials
7938.31,on ketogenic diet
and,Alzheimer's?
7940.26,I don't expect you to be
responsible,for that fact.
7945.42,"But goodness, I would"
think,this would
7947.67,be the obvious thing for NIH.
7951.12,I'm on study section but not
for,these sorts of experiments.
7954.93,Why isn't money just avalanching
into,this area based on all
7959.04,the anecdotal evidence that
people,are talking about?
7962.082,CHRIS PALMER: So
we've,got a couple
7963.54,of small pilot clinical trials.
7967.08,The best one was a
randomized,controlled trial.
7970.62,I think it only included 26
"subjects,","something like that,"
7974.52,randomized to 12 weeks of a
low,"fat diet, 10-week washout,"
7981.54,12 weeks of ketogenic diet.
7984.45,Some of the participants got
keto,first and then low fat.
7987.9,Other participants
got,low fat then keto.
7991.02,And that trial actually
found,that when patients
7996.18,"were in ketosis, they had"
statistically,significant
8002.87,improvement in activities
of,daily living and quality
8007.49,of life.
8008.99,And they did have improvement
in,cognitive function.
8012.47,But it didn't reach
statistical,"significance,"
8015.05,that improvement did not.
8018.65,We've got other trials.
8020.84,We've got several animal models
showing,that the ketogenic diet
8025.49,can improve biomarkers
of,Alzheimer's disease
8029.12,in Alzheimer's models.
8031.28,So it can reduce
plaques,"and tangles,"
8033.68,can even improve cognitive
impairment,in animal models.
8040.25,And we've got a couple
of,other small pilot
8042.62,trials of ketogenic
diet,"in humans,"
8045.95,showing that it improves
biomarkers,compared
8048.98,"to, say, the low fat diet or"
the,American Heart Association
8051.8,diet.
8052.58,So we've got those.
8055.23,I think one of the
biggest,challenges
8056.87,that I'll just share openly--
8059.535,and this is-- I'm
somebody,who's pretty
8061.16,passionate about this research.
8062.48,And I believe it has
a,lot of potential.
8066.32,But Johns Hopkins'
researchers,attempted
8070.58,to do exactly this kind of a
"study,",Alzheimer's patients'
8076.88,ketogenic diet
versus,"the, I think,"
8080.15,American Academy of Aging--
8081.56,or something like that--
"diet,",is the controlled diet.
8083.965,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which,presumably
8085.34,has starches in there.
8086.48,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
8086.54,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
that's,the key variable.
8087.56,CHRIS PALMER: Probably
lots,"of-- yeah, lots of--"
8089.33,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And,some potatoes--
8089.93,"CHRIS PALMER: Whole grains,"
lots,of whole grains.
8091.08,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Yeah,",some potatoes.
8093.11,"CHRIS PALMER: And they spent,"
I,"believe, over three years."
8098.26,"They screened over 1,300"
people,who expressed interest.
8107.583,At the end of the
"day,",I think they only
8109.25,got 27 people to enroll.
8112.49,And only 14 of those
people,completed the study.
8116.18,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
8117.53,CHRIS PALMER: Despite
"that,",what they
8119.69,found was that the subjects
who,achieved ketosis
8123.41,had cognitive improvement.
8126.98,But people on study
section,are going
8129.56,to look at a study like that
and,"say, even if the science is"
8135.11,"there, if you can't get"
people,"to do this diet,"
8139.86,why would we spend money
on,researchers trying
8143.7,to get people to do this diet?
8145.35,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I,"should mention,"
8146.767,study section is this closed
door,panels of 40 or so people.
8151.303,There are many of these panels.
8155.34,Different divisions in the
National,Institutes of Health
8158.005,use different panels.
8158.88,And then grants are
evaluated,"in a very small,"
8163.128,because of the size of the
federal,"budget for research,"
8165.42,a very small percentage.
8168.54,"Usually, about 10% of"
these,studies are funded.
8171.78,The rest generally
don't,end up happening.
8176.7,That is very informative.
8179.94,What you just described
is,very informative
8181.8,because now it
makes,sense to me.
8184.83,There's no conspiracy.
8186.69,"It's not big pharma,"
I,"don't think,"
8188.97,is trying to suppress
trials,of ketogenic diets
8193.027,on Alzheimer's because
I,would imagine
8194.61,the first thing that
pharma,would want to do
8196.68,is to see that study done.
8197.921,So they didn't have to.
8198.879,"And then the moment it was done,"
if,"it showed a positive effect,"
8201.45,they'd probably want
to,isolate the molecule
8203.283,and wrap it up in something
that,"people would take, right?"
8205.74,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
8206.01,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,I don't think
8206.67,there's any active
suppression,by pharma.
8208.378,I think pharma would probably
be,cheering from the sidelines
8210.93,because they could capitalize
on,"it, because ultimately,"
8213.472,the studies are
done,by scientists.
8214.93,But the treatments are
generally,doled out
8216.9,by pharmaceutical companies
and/or,physicians.
8219.67,So I don't believe there's
a,conspiracy there.
8221.79,That is very interesting.
8223.2,"And it's kind of amazing,"
given,our discussion
8227.17,"of earlier, which is that"
you,had a patient that
8229.93,was having schizophrenic
symptoms,who
8232.54,managed to stay on this diet.
8234.1,So is there something special
about,Alzheimer's patients
8238.15,and people with age-related
cognitive,decline?
8240.309,"Presumably, they're"
very,dependent on others
8242.86,to cook for them
and,shop for them.
8246.58,I think that this is almost
perfect,controlled environment
8249.43,for getting this study done.
8250.91,CHRIS PALMER: I think
that,is the key issue.
8253.82,"So again, I got patients--"
8256.48,I get patients with bipolar
"disorder,","schizophrenia,"
8261.16,extraordinarily impaired
people,to do this diet
8265.6,and stay with it.
8266.59,But it's because I'm providing
a,weekly session for them.
8272.32,And I imagine this
study,did not provide
8276.04,that kind of intensive support.
8279.52,In the pilot trial that
I,"described to you,"
8281.83,"they actually got, I"
"think,",over 90% compliance
8284.709,with the different
dietary,interventions.
8287.57,So some of it is going to
be,dependent on the research
8291.58,group.
8292.18,And does the research group
understand,that this is not--
8295.87,it's not like
prescribing,a pill.
8298.18,"Here, take this pill."
8300.1,And take it every day and
come,back in three weeks.
8303.79,"And even then, we"
don't,know for sure
8305.44,that the patient took
the,pill every day.
8307.27,We just assume they
took,the pill every day.
8309.52,And studies say they
probably,didn't.
8312.79,So I think when we think
about,"a dietary intervention,"
8315.7,we need to think about
more,intensive support
8319.6,and education.
8321.129,And that support could be a
health,and wellness coach.
8324.44,It could be a dietician.
8326.02,It could be education
of,the family.
8328.54,It might even be providing
them,with dietary meals.
8335.02,"That maybe for six months,"
we,actually provide them
8339.67,with ketogenic meals--
8342.879,"once a week, put"
them,in your freezer.
8345.91,Microwave them when needed--
8347.77,to make this diet as easy
and,doable as possible.
8354.2,Because if we can get
people,"to do the diet,"
8356.99,if we can get them through
the,"first couple of months,"
8359.879,most people can learn
how,to do this diet.
8363.26,More importantly-- I
didn't,mention this before.
8367.23,But the number one reason I
am,so successful at getting
8370.85,patients to stay on
this,"diet for years,"
8374.98,is because of the consequences
to,them when they go off of it.
8379.95,That is the reason I can
get,schizophrenic patients
8383.37,and bipolar patients
to,"do this diet,"
8385.629,whereas other people can't
get,an everyday human
8388.8,being to do it for weight
loss,because the weight loss
8391.98,patient doesn't experience
devastating,tormenting symptoms
8398.34,when they break the diet.
8400.83,"Oftentimes, they are rewarded."
8402.45,They eat something
they,really enjoy.
8405.24,And they get a little bit
of,a dopamine rush from it.
8407.76,And they're off to the races.
8409.02,"They're like, I'm going to--"
"oh,",I've already cheated.
8411.27,I'll cheat again.
8412.21,I'll get back on it someday.
8413.52,And they never get around to it.
8415.85,"My patients, when"
they,"go off the diet,"
8419.3,they start hallucinating
within,48--
8421.4,"or 24, 48 hours."
8424.01,And they quickly realize that
was,a really stupid thing
8427.4,to do.
8428.21,That piece of cake
was,not at all worth
8431.39,the torment that I'm
experiencing,now.
8434.3,So they get back on the diet.
8436.25,I suspect with
Alzheimer's,"disease,"
8438.48,we might notice
something,similar.
8442.28,Some of these people
have,very mild symptoms.
8444.99,So maybe they won't
have,that kind
8447.65,"of a reinforcement, negative"
reinforcing,kind of experience.
8452.51,But I think some of them will.
8454.34,Some of them recognize that
they,are impaired cognitively.
8460.7,And if this diet could
help,"them remember better,"
8464.33,if this diet could help
them,function better--
8466.883,"and again, that's what"
the,"pilot trial showed,"
8468.8,is activities of daily living.
8470.367,That means these
people,are able to go
8471.95,to the bathroom on their own.
8473.39,They're able to get
themselves,dressed.
8475.4,"Whereas, they needed help"
with,those things before.
8479.81,Those are actually
really,important things
8482.72,to both the patient
and,the caregiver.
8487.37,And if they go off
the,diet and then
8489.26,quickly revert into a
more,"symptomatic state,"
8493.58,that might be reinforcing
enough,for them
8497.57,to figure out a way to
do,the diet on their own.
8501.38,And if we think
"about,",if this really
8503.33,is an effective
intervention--,"and yes,"
8505.13,"we need longer trials,"
larger,"trials, all of that,"
8508.04,because there are
plenty,of stories
8510.32,in the medical field where
pilot,trials looked really
8514.4,spectacular and promising.
8516.59,And then larger trials just
failed,to show the benefits.
8521.55,"I believe, based on all"
the,"science of metabolism,"
8525.3,"mitochondria, glucose"
"hypometabolism,","all of that,"
8528.3,I believe the science makes
this,an obvious treatment that
8534.42,has real potential.
8536.19,So people will call me biased.
8539.19,That's fine.
8539.727,I've got my bias.
8540.435,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, based"
on,clinical observation
8542.76,and extensive clinical
observation,at that--
8545.61,I think biases that
are,simply because we
8548.22,want to feel a certain
way,or believe something
8551.34,are worth critiquing.
8553.53,But bias based on
observation--,"here,"
8557.01,I should mention that most of
what,we know about human memory
8562.17,"was sparked by one patient,"
a,"famous HM, who I think"
8565.62,"was living in Harvard Medical,"
in,one of the hospitals around.
8569.697,There are many hospitals
on,Longwood Campus.
8571.53,"But one patient, the"
reason,we associate
8576.21,the hippocampus with memory
is,because we knew that HM's
8579.69,the hippocampus
was,intentionally
8581.73,damaged for epilepsy treatment.
8584.28,So this idea that
everything,has to be
8586.89,a randomized clinical
"trial,","to me, is crazy."
8589.89,"Of course, that's"
a,gold standard.
8592.35,And it's essential.
8594.0,But there's so much information
in,"textbooks, medical textbooks"
8598.38,"in particular, that are gleaned"
from,single-patient case
8601.38,studies or from three-patient
neurostimulation,in the brain
8605.34,or something of that sort.
8606.46,"So to me, I'm still"
perplexed,as to why
8612.78,there's this insistence on
only,one form of evidence.
8617.46,"Clearly, what you're"
"doing,",the important work
8620.328,"that you're doing clinically,"
and,"in the research side,"
8622.62,"and in public communication,"
is,assisting this.
8626.05,I have a question about--
8627.79,or more of a statement/question
about,the ketogenic diet.
8631.54,Based on everything
that,"we've talked about,"
8633.73,seems to me that the
ketogenic,diet for weight loss
8637.6,is a very interesting
aspect,of the diet
8640.15,as is intermittent
fasting,for weight loss
8643.09,even though it might just be
by,way of caloric restriction
8646.06,that occurs with fasting.
8647.97,But then in some
"ways,",the effects
8650.88,of the ketogenic
diet,on weight loss
8653.19,are a bit of a decoy
for,most people.
8655.402,That's where their mind goes.
8656.61,This person lost X
amount,of weight.
8658.26,Maybe that made
them,feel better.
8659.47,Maybe that actually
made,them underweight.
8660.72,I think you've talked about it.
8661.59,"For some people, it can actually"
bring,them under weight.
8666.68,I'm glad that we got
the,chance to dive
8668.33,into the description of
ketogenic,diet for epilepsy
8670.73,because it really is a
medical,intervention that
8673.88,has a side effect of
weight,loss or could
8676.73,be used to treat obesity
and,induce weight loss.
8680.12,But it's really about
far,more than that.
8684.12,And that raises a question
for,"me, which is--"
8687.431,we've been talking about the
ketogenic,diet as one thing.
8691.07,But I've heard you
discuss,"this before,"
8693.65,where just as a physician will
prescribe,different dosage
8698.45,"ranges of a given drug, you"
can,prescribe different dosage
8702.8,ranges of a nutritional
"plan,",a diet.
8705.63,It's not one thing.
8706.73,It's not necessarily
zero,carbohydrates
8709.22,or 100 grams or 50 grams.
8710.69,It depends on the patient
and,a lot of other factors.
8714.14,I've heard you list off
various,things classic keto.
8716.667,Maybe you could just briefly
tell,us what that typically
8719.0,"is, because I think"
most,people think
8721.4,it means eating a lot of
meat,and not carbohydrates.
8724.82,But it might not be that.
8727.01,Fasting and then some
of,the other-- you
8729.2,mentioned Atkins earlier.
8730.488,We don't have to go into
each,of these in detail.
8732.53,And I know in your
"book,",you talk about
8734.155,not just the science and
clinical,background but also
8736.43,some actionable steps that
people,could consider.
8739.26,So they can refer
there,for more detail.
8741.66,But for somebody
"who,","let's say, is"
8744.17,depressed-- they've had
some,rounds of depression.
8746.78,Maybe they're on
"antidepressants,",maybe not--
8748.85,and they want to try
something,like this.
8751.56,"Obviously, this has to be done"
in,concert with a physician
8754.91,observing all this.
8756.14,But what is the typical thing
that,you probe with first?
8760.167,Just like with a
"drug,",you might probe
8761.75,with 20 milligrams of a drug.
8763.22,What's your typical initial
dietary,intervention probe?
8768.26,"Terrible languaging, I realize."
8769.67,And I'm criticizing
myself,for that.
8771.95,But I think people get the idea.
8774.08,CHRIS PALMER: The real
answer,is that I don't have
8776.24,a one-size-fits-all
recommendation,for any person.
8779.365,So the first thing
that,I'm going
8780.74,"to assess with the patient is,"
what,symptoms are they having?
8784.55,What is their current diet like?
8786.56,And what are they willing to do?
8788.6,I try to meet them
where,they're at.
8790.68,So if somebody-- and
I,want to point out.
8794.72,You mentioned the
all-meat,version
8797.39,"of this diet, which"
is,often referred
8799.82,to as the carnivore diet.
8800.972,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Very
controversial,diet.
8802.68,CHRIS PALMER: There is
no,doubt that exists.
8804.94,Some people swear by it.
8805.94,They swear they've tried other
versions,of ketogenic diets
8808.618,and only when they went
to,a carnivore diet
8810.41,did they get benefits.
8812.09,But there are vegetarian
and,vegan versions
8814.55,of the ketogenic diet.
8816.18,"So in my mind,"
this,is not at all
8818.9,about the diet wars
of,animal-sourced
8821.54,versus plant-sourced foods.
8823.28,It's about inducing a
state,"of ketosis, which"
8827.06,is mimicking the fasting state.
8829.07,That is what it's about.
8830.42,And you can do that by
not,"eating anything,"
8832.94,by fasting and/or
intermittent,fasting.
8835.88,And you get your results.
8837.36,So no diet is a ketogenic diet.
8841.62,So it's not about the
foods,or the types of foods
8844.67,that you're eating.
8845.55,It's about inducing
a,state of ketosis.
8848.27,The first variable I'm going to
look,at when I recommend this
8851.09,or prescribe this is the
person's,current weight.
8854.39,If somebody is obese
versus,"somebody who's thin,"
8859.58,I'm going to use different
dietary,strategies
8861.71,for those two situations.
8863.18,"In the obese patient, they"
have,tons of fat stores
8866.45,on their body already.
8868.22,"Usually, it is a goal of theirs"
to,tap into some of those.
8871.82,And they'd like to
lose,some weight
8873.83,if they're going to try a
ketogenic,diet for brain health
8876.53,anyway.
8877.76,And so I'm going to use that.
8879.9,"So that person, really, the diet"
is,carbohydrate restriction.
8884.42,And that usually is a
sufficient,intervention.
8887.158,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Both
simple,"carbohydrates,"
8888.95,meaning sugars
and,fructose also?
8891.89,CHRIS PALMER:
"Fructose,",definitely.
8893.39,"So no added sugars, essentially."
8896.69,You can have added natural
sweeteners,like stevia or monk
8900.68,fruit.
8902.09,You might use
artificial,sweeteners.
8906.26,Years of doing
"this,",I'd probably
8908.858,recommend steer away
from,them if you
8910.4,can because I think
they,tend to stimulate
8912.2,cravings for high carb foods.
8915.02,So if you can kind of get
through,a couple of weeks
8917.84,"without sweet things,"
your,cravings for those
8923.09,will go down.
8923.87,And it'll make the diet easier
and,a little more sustainable.
8926.42,But let's say you can have
your,"artificial sweeteners,"
8929.72,if that's what you really want.
8932.93,So I'm going to say less
than,20 grams of carbs a day
8935.17,for those people.
8936.93,They can have all the
protein,they want.
8939.06,They can have vegetables.
8940.643,And they can have all
the,fat they want.
8942.31,But I'm not going to
push,fat on those people.
8945.06,"I'm not going to tell them, eat"
a,"lot of fat, at the same time"
8947.82,because I want to use the fat
on,"their body as the fat source,"
8952.44,at least early on.
8953.64,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Are,you encouraging
8955.14,healthy fats like
monounsaturated,"fats,"
8956.91,like olive oil?
8957.66,Are you encouraging people
to,eat a little less
8961.83,"butter, et cetera?"
8967.26,CHRIS PALMER: I tend
to,"encourage, again,"
8970.85,a wide range of fats.
8971.825,And it's going to
depend,on the person.
8973.45,"A lot of times, people come to"
me,with very specific ideas.
8977.17,But I'm going to tend to
encourage,"olive oil, avocados,"
8981.53,"nuts, which are"
usually,"considered,"
8984.07,even by the American
Heart,"Association,"
8985.75,healthy sources of fat.
8988.21,The more controversial
thing,are things
8989.98,like coconut oil or coconut
"cream,",which the American Heart
8993.46,Association might say
is,"not a healthy fat,"
8996.1,I kind of disagree with
that,and don't think
8998.68,it's unhealthy at all actually.
9001.17,And when you look at the
epidemiological,studies
9004.14,of saturated fat
causing,heart disease
9007.47,"or causing adverse outcomes, at"
"best,",maybe increases your risk
9012.6,10% to 15%-- at best.
9013.908,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
How,much coconut oil
9015.45,"can people ingest, anyway,"
before,they either develop
9019.29,diarrhea-- no joke--
or,just sort of get
9021.99,tired of coconut oil?
9023.61,"Anyway, your point is taken."
9027.06,But they can eat meat
if,they like meat?
9029.46,CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
9029.64,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or
they,can eat eggs.
9030.81,Or if they don't
like,"meat and eggs,"
9032.4,they could eat sardines
or,things of that sort.
9034.5,I personally can't--
9035.407,I can't even stomach the--
9036.49,I don't even like
the,"word ""sardine."""
9038.365,I have nothing against
the,actual fish.
9039.99,But that's just me.
9041.73,"But obviously, people have--"
9042.99,I say this because people have
different,"preferences, right?"
9045.6,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
9046.14,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I'll,eat a steak.
9046.77,But I'm not going
to,eat a sardine.
9047.91,CHRIS PALMER: And I'm
going,to go with that.
9049.743,"And again, there are vegan"
sources,of protein that--
9052.38,people can eat tempeh
and,other things.
9055.51,So that's the obese person.
9060.12,It's carb restriction as
the,primary initial phase.
9064.72,The thin person is going
to,need to eat a lot of fat
9067.38,because they don't have a lot
of,fat stores on their body.
9070.66,And if I want them in
"ketosis,","clinical ketosis,"
9073.98,I'm going to have
to,feed them fat.
9075.612,So that's the person
that,I'm going
9077.07,"to say, make sure"
you,"get in avocados,"
9080.79,"olive oil, butter,"
maybe,heavy cream.
9085.72,So heavy cream is delicious.
9087.09,It's a delicious way
to,get your fats in.
9090.105,I have one patient who
just,"drinks it straight,"
9092.25,to just try to get it in.
9093.597,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get it.
9094.68,I've never had an
appetite,for sweets.
9098.49,I absolutely love
savory,fatty food.
9102.0,When I was in high
"school,",I was thin.
9104.52,So I was able to do this.
9106.27,But I used to drink
half-and-half.,
9107.687,Sometimes I wake up in
the,middle of the night
9109.603,and drink it just because
it,"tastes so, so good."
9111.78,CHRIS PALMER: It
does,taste good.
9113.57,So if they're on
a,"ketogenic diet,"
9115.08,I'm going to push them
away,from half-and-half
9117.93,and toward heavy whipping cream.
9121.62,So you can whip that up.
9123.15,You can freeze it.
9124.11,It turns into ice cream.
9125.53,You can add vanilla.
9126.42,You can add cocoa powder.
9127.667,You can add all sorts of things.
9129.0,And you're off to the races
with,"shakes, and ice cream,"
9132.21,"and mousse, and all sorts"
of,things that you can have.
9137.82,"With any of these patients,"
the,beauty of this diet
9141.45,is I have objective biomarkers.
9144.06,I'm going to have them
measuring,ketones.
9146.13,And I'm going to adjust the diet
based,on their state of ketosis
9150.09,and/or the clinical benefits
that,I'm looking for.
9154.02,"If it's an average person,"
who,is not currently
9157.08,"under psychiatric care, not"
taking,prescription medicines
9161.64,"but is saying, I'm burned out."
9164.43,I'm exhausted.
9165.93,I want some of that brain
energy,that Andrew Huberman
9168.63,is talking about.
9169.98,He talks about feeling good.
9171.33,I want some of that.
9173.16,I'm probably actually
going,to recommend
9174.93,the protocol you
"describe,","which is,"
9177.36,let's see if we can just
carb,restrict for a while
9181.47,and see if that produces
clinical,benefit.
9184.41,I have one-- he's
not,"even a patient,"
9187.32,just somebody who read my book.
9191.61,I didn't tell him anything.
9193.65,And he came away
from,it saying--
9195.57,he was ready to start an
antidepressant,for his anxiety.
9200.1,"He had chronic anxiety,"
was,"trying meditation,"
9202.59,was trying all sorts of things.
9204.84,Nothing-- those
things,weren't enough.
9207.64,He was ready to go on
prescription,medicine.
9210.3,He read an early
copy,of the book.
9212.16,He took it upon himself without
consulting,with me to restrict
9215.31,carbohydrates alone.
9216.66,He did not go ketogenic.
9218.4,He is a vegetarian.
9221.02,He restricted carbs.
9222.75,"Within three weeks,"
"said,",I don't
9225.84,need prescription medicine.
9227.31,I can't believe how
much,better I feel.
9229.89,And all I did was cut
out,some of the high carb
9233.19,foods in my diet.
9235.27,"So I think for some people,"
it,can be that simple.
9239.44,For people with serious
mental,"disorders,"
9242.45,if they are chronically
"depressed,",if they're
9244.51,on lots of prescription
"meds,",if they're
9246.43,disabled by their
"symptoms,","and certainly,"
9248.83,if you're bipolar or have
schizophrenia,"or something,"
9253.6,those are the people
I,really do want
9255.16,them to work with a
medical,professional
9257.87,because meds may
need,to be adjusted.
9262.28,They need a real
shot,at this diet.
9266.71,It's not like weight loss.
9268.16,"Weight loss, everybody wings it."
9270.41,And either you're
successful,or you aren't.
9272.36,You look on the internet or
you,read a book or you do--
9275.51,even the colleague
that,"you mentioned,"
9277.7,he's probably just reading--
9280.17,who knows whether it's
credible,information or not--
9284.37,"and just winging it, and"
seeing,whether it works or not.
9290.05,For people with serious
mental,"disorders,"
9293.08,I want you to treat it like you
have,epilepsy because you do
9298.75,have a serious brain disorder.
9301.39,It's impairing your ability
to,function in the world.
9304.21,It's impairing your
health,and happiness.
9306.55,You deserve a competent
medical,treatment.
9309.76,And we have that.
9310.81,We have a hundred-year
evidence-based.,
9314.24,We've got dieticians
who,know this
9317.06,like the back of their hand.
9318.62,They can monitor your
level,of ketosis.
9324.13,They can help look for vitamin
and,nutrient deficiencies
9327.13,that can be a
consequence,"of the diet,"
9329.53,and make sure that you're
not,developing those.
9331.81,They can help tweak
the,diet if needed.
9334.99,They can give you ideas if
you're,getting bored with eggs
9337.45,every morning.
9338.11,They can give you ideas for
what,else you might have.
9340.825,And if you're using it to
treat,"a serious disorder,"
9345.22,I think you need serious help.
9348.24,ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
couple,"of questions,"
9350.33,"a little more detailed,"
but,I think a lot of people
9353.09,will have this on their mind.
9355.13,Is it ever the case
that,you'll prescribe
9357.8,somebody the ketogenic
diet,in conjunction
9360.59,with intermittent fasting?
9361.7,So eat keto but eat
between,the hours
9364.16,"of, whatever, 11:00 AM and"
8:00,PM or something like that.
9368.057,That's the first question.
9369.14,CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely.
9370.58,And I have one patient with
type,2 diabetes and chronic
9373.85,depression.
9374.63,And he will try to follow
the,ketogenic diet.
9378.05,"And sometimes, his blood"
sugars,are still very high.
9382.74,And sometimes I
will,ask him to do
9385.13,either intermittent fasting or
even,a three or four day water
9389.39,fast.
9390.89,And it is shocking.
9392.93,When he does a three or four
day,"water fast, the first day"
9397.22,"or two, he feels like crap."
9398.87,"I'll just say up front,"
don't,do it if you've got
9401.96,an important meeting or
business,trip or anything.
9404.51,Don't be--
9405.11,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this
is,just consuming water.
9406.89,CHRIS PALMER: This is
just,consuming water.
9408.682,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
No,black coffee?
9410.6,CHRIS PALMER: I usually tell him
he,can have plain black coffee
9413.9,or tea.
9415.37,But--
9416.275,ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
have,mercy after all.
9418.025,CHRIS PALMER: I have
a,tiny ounce of mercy.
9422.43,"But when he does it, his blood"
sugars,"plummet in a good way,"
9428.22,his blood sugars
are,normalizing.
9430.6,"But the last time he did it,"
he,actually got to seven days
9434.8,at one point.
9436.14,"And he said, I feel great."
9437.44,I want to keep going.
9438.45,I can't believe
that,I'm not hungry.
9440.92,But I am not hungry at all.
9442.59,I don't miss food at all.
9444.96,"And at seven days, I"
kind,of cut the cord.
9447.15,"I was like, no, no."
9448.02,We're done.
9448.44,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
He,needs to eat.
9448.785,CHRIS PALMER:
[LAUGHS],We're done.
9449.73,ANDREW HUBERMAN: You got to eat.
9450.48,"Well, I find it"
really,interesting
9451.71,that the intermittent
"fasting,","of course,"
9453.418,"controversial at some level,"
but,as to whether or not
9457.56,it's just beneficial by way
of,caloric restriction--
9460.77,because it is one way to
achieve,caloric restriction--
9463.345,whether or not has
additional,benefits.
9464.97,But I'm very interested
in,the neural side of it.
9469.14,And it does seem
that,the fasted state
9471.18,can start to take on its
own,"rewarding properties,"
9473.97,where people get
dopamine,release not
9477.3,"from eating, as"
most,"everyone does,"
9479.34,but from abstaining from food.
9481.45,"Now, this can be pathologic"
in,the sort of example
9484.35,"of anorexia nervosa, which"
is,we both know as the most
9488.4,deadly psychiatric illness.
9490.32,"But for non-anoxerics,"
I,think it's
9493.47,interesting to note that
eventually,not eating can have
9496.53,its own rewarding properties
to,it that aren't just related
9499.86,to weight loss.
9500.65,"But in the short-term, feeling--"
9502.03,"in other words, feeling"
really,good by way
9503.82,of abstaining from eating.
9505.08,CHRIS PALMER: Yes.
9506.13,And that's actually-- it
raises,an important risk
9509.76,that I haven't mentioned yet.
9511.89,But at least in
psychiatric,patients--
9513.87,but even in some
patients,who just
9515.55,use the keto diet
for,"weight loss,"
9517.35,I have seen definite hypomania.
9520.83,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,these are people
9522.33,that aren't sleeping very much.
9525.21,Are they also getting
kind,"of delusional,"
9527.43,thinking they're going
to,run for president?
9529.44,CHRIS PALMER: No.
9530.25,So the distinction between
hypomania,and mania--
9533.46,"so mania, you might become"
psychotic,and delusional.
9536.88,"Mania, by definition,"
is,problematic.
9539.73,It's causing a problem
in,some way or another.
9542.4,And if you have
psychotic,"symptoms,"
9543.91,it's definitely called
"mania,",full-blown mania.
9546.57,"Hypomania, for"
better,"or worse, is"
9549.84,something every human
being,probably craves.
9552.66,So it is feeling
extraordinarily,good.
9557.43,It's getting by on less sleep.
9559.38,But you don't need to sleep.
9560.58,Who needs sleep?
9561.42,I've got things to do.
9564.51,My brain is running
on,all cylinders.
9568.89,I feel so creative.
9572.44,There have been lots
of,famous people
9574.18,through the ages who have been
"bipolar,",probably bipolar.
9579.04,And some of their most
productive,"periods of time,"
9582.62,whether it's art or
creating,scientific models
9587.08,"or what-have-you, were probably"
during,hypomanic episodes.
9591.23,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what
do,you do in that case?
9593.29,I'm obsessed with getting
sufficient,quality sleep.
9596.32,It's a kind of a repeating
theme,in our podcast
9599.17,and many of my
social,media posts.
9601.69,And I always recommend
behavioral,"tools first,"
9605.41,"then exercise, viewing"
"sunlight,","et cetera,"
9609.1,"at appropriate times,"
avoiding,late night
9611.2,"artificial light exposure,"
et,"cetera, and occasionally,"
9615.465,for people who
are,doing all that
9616.84,and still struggle with
"sleep,",supplementation.
9619.36,One of the things that
I've,seen some data on
9622.66,is that for people who are
following,a low carbohydrate
9625.09,"diet, that inositol,"
in,"particular,"
9627.55,can be helpful for
getting,into sleep
9631.06,probably because it's
a,bit of an-- has
9632.89,a bit of an anti-anxiety effect.
9634.63,"But presumably, there are"
other,"things out there, too."
9636.88,The magnesiums will
generally,do that.
9638.47,"A hot bath will do that,"
"too,",for that matter.
9640.72,But what you're talking about
is,"people who are going,"
9642.97,"what, a day and a"
half,without sleep?
9644.86,Or they're just two
hours,of sleep a night?
9648.525,CHRIS PALMER: So
the,worst case I
9649.9,saw was actually a mental
health,professional who
9652.15,didn't recognize it initially.
9653.92,He went six months with
two,to four hours of sleep
9657.73,every night.
9658.42,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they
were,on a ketogenic diet?
9659.89,CHRIS PALMER: He was
on,"a ketogenic diet,"
9661.75,was getting by on two to four
hours,"of sleep every night,"
9664.75,did not initially recognize
that,this was a problem.
9668.24,He was feeling great.
9670.76,He was feeling that keto high.
9674.29,And he was actually
waking,"up at 4:00 AM,"
9679.09,going for 10 to 20
mile,runs most days.
9683.2,He finally stopped the ketogenic
diet,after about six months
9686.26,"because he said, I can't"
maintain,my weight.
9689.14,I'm losing too much weight.
9690.7,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, I"
didn't,mean to interrupt.
9692.28,I was just thinking there
are,some social media
9694.238,personalities associated
with,nutrition
9696.13,that might be hypomanic.
9698.53,I'll let you do the
clinical,evaluation.
9702.47,So what does somebody
do,in that case?
9704.47,So I don't know that
I've,ever been hypomanic.
9707.29,But as I mentioned
"earlier,",unless I've
9709.54,done a very high intensity
workout,early in the day
9712.067,and I need to replenish
"carbohydrates,",
9713.65,"I typically eat meat, fruit, and"
vegetables,throughout the day--
9718.33,minimum amounts
of,fruit but some.
9720.76,"And then at night, I switch"
over,to mainly carbohydrate.
9723.7,It really helps me sleep.
9724.9,It replenishes glycogen stores.
9726.7,"I sleep really well, wake"
up,"the next morning, repeat."
9730.425,"And of course, this goes"
against,a lot of the dogma
9732.55,"that, oh, you're not"
supposed,to eat carbohydrates
9733.99,late in the day and [MUMBLES].
9735.37,This is what works for me.
9738.31,And so I do it.
9740.08,For somebody like this mental
health,"professional, who"
9743.26,"is hypomanic, would going off"
the,ketogenic diet entirely
9747.31,be the best idea?
9748.63,Or could it be
that,adjusting when
9751.54,they eat their carbohydrates
would,be advantageous
9754.42,in order to make
sure,that they felt
9756.158,alert and great during the day?
9757.45,Maybe not hypomanic
but,then could
9761.68,have a four to eight-hour a
night,sleep as opposed to a two
9765.04,"to four hours a night, which"
is,really very little sleep.
9767.59,"CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, it's not--"
9768.31,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It
can't,be healthy.
9769.33,CHRIS PALMER: It's not healthy.
9770.35,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even if you
can,"do it and feel great,"
9771.98,I imagine that the
brain,is suffering.
9773.657,CHRIS PALMER: It is.
9774.49,And the body is suffering.
9776.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
your,friends and family
9777.01,are suffering.
9777.593,CHRIS PALMER: The body is
repairing,itself with sleep.
9780.02,"And so yeah, it's--"
9784.51,if it's somebody who
is,"not a patient,"
9787.4,they're not a mental
health,patient.
9789.25,They're not using
the,ketogenic diet
9791.2,as a mental health treatment.
9792.52,They're simply doing
it,for whatever.
9795.55,I actually start with
everything,you've just outlined.
9800.61,Let's start with
behavioral,measures first.
9804.03,And the first
intervention,is education.
9807.51,You need at least six
hours,of sleep a night.
9811.14,"Period, end of story."
9812.85,That's non-negotiable.
9814.44,If you're not getting at least
six,"hours of sleep a night,"
9817.56,we need to consider
this,a problem.
9819.82,So figure out a way to
get,6 hours of sleep.
9822.66,"For some people, that's"
"enough,",just the education.
9825.83,They don't get out
of,bed at 3:00 AM.
9829.258,It might take them an hour
to,fall back to sleep.
9831.3,They fall back to sleep.
9833.57,"For most people, if you can get"
three,nights of decent sleep
9838.31,"in a row, the"
hypomania,goes away.
9842.3,That is the way
to,extinguish it.
9845.36,And then they still go on
feeling,a high from it.
9848.51,They feel great.
9850.4,Their brain feels good in
terms,"of memory, concentration,"
9855.47,"motivation, all of those things."
9857.27,But they're not
hypomanic,anymore.
9861.34,And then I might use
"supplements,","melatonin, others"
9865.53,"that you mentioned,"
magnesium,is a big one.
9867.99,"And for some, I will recommend"
exactly,what you're doing--
9873.0,eat some carbohydrates
in,the evening
9875.94,before you're going to bed.
9877.66,Either have them at dinner
and,then wait a few hours
9880.235,before you're going to go
to,bed or have them right
9882.36,before you're going
to,"go to bed, just"
9884.22,to try to calm your body
down,and get it going.
9890.37,When I'm using this as
a,"clinical intervention,"
9892.9,especially with patients
with,"serious mental illness,"
9897.05,I actually want them in a
state,of ketosis long-term.
9901.11,So I'm not going to do the
carbohydrate,intervention.
9903.71,I'm going to try
all,the other ones.
9905.81,But if they still can't
sleep,"even with supplements,"
9909.05,over the counter
"supplements,",then I'm
9910.76,probably going to go with
"prescription,",sleeping
9914.24,"medicines, as a"
temporary,stopgap
9918.72,to try to get them three to
seven,days of decent sleep.
9923.88,That usually breaks
the,hypomanic cycle.
9927.41,And then they stay
on,the ketogenic diet
9929.75,because it ends up resulting in
all,of these other improvements
9932.96,that I've described.
9934.73,Their illness can sometimes
go,in to full remission.
9939.95,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it low
dose,trazodone as a first line
9942.5,prescription?
9943.28,CHRIS PALMER: I would
not,use trazodone.
9944.99,I would actually
specifically,avoid trazodone
9947.21,because it's an antidepressant.
9949.46,And they're already hypomanic.
9951.26,And I certainly don't
want,to push that further.
9953.97,So as long as it's somebody
without,"a history of addiction,"
9958.43,I'm going to use
a,benzodiazepine
9961.37,or either commonly called
the,Z medicines for sleep--
9966.68,zolpidem or Ambien or
something,like that.
9969.17,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those tap
into,the opioid pathway?
9971.48,GABA opioid?
9972.5,CHRIS PALMER: GABA.
9974.3,I usually start with something
like,Ativan or Klonopin
9976.55,or something like that--
9977.75,probably Ativan because
it's,shorter-acting.
9980.76,"And again, I'm only looking"
to,use it short-term.
9983.09,I let them know that up front.
9984.95,We're looking for three to
seven,days of decent sleep.
9987.62,And then we're going to try
to,get them off that medicine.
9990.83,"And usually, people"
are,off to the races
9993.59,and can sustain it well.
9997.73,ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
question,about hormones.
10000.01,Many of the Huberman Lab
podcast,listeners will ask--
10004.39,any time we're talking about
something,like exercise
10006.85,or a drug treatment or
behavioral,"training,"
10009.46,"people will say, what"
about,the menstrual cycle?
10012.19,How is that impacted by this?
10015.88,How does the menstrual cycle
impact,"its efficacy, et cetera?"
10020.84,Carbohydrates and
caloric,restriction
10023.93,have been implicated in
different,interactions--
10027.05,are known to interact
with,the endocrine system.
10030.33,So what do you do if you have
a,patient who is depressed
10036.95,or could have
psychotic,symptoms--
10038.493,but let's go with depression
because,that's probably a bit
10040.91,more familiar to most people--
10042.92,and then they're on
a,low carbohydrate
10045.23,"or full ketogenic diet, but"
their,menstrual cycles cease.
10050.72,How do you deal with
those,adjustments?
10053.58,And I guess we could
expand,this conversation
10055.7,"and say, what about"
male,fertility also?
10057.8,Because some caloric
diets,seem to--
10061.67,my understanding is that
submaintenance,"caloric diets,"
10067.67,so weight loss
"diets,",will improve
10071.35,testosterone-estrogen ratios
in,males that are obese.
10074.86,But for someone
that's,"not obese,"
10077.95,"to go on a sub-caloric diet,"
that,it can start to impair
10081.64,testosterone levels and--
10083.29,probably not render
them,infertile
10085.51,but certainly adjust
that,whole axis.
10088.94,So what about interactions
between,"ketosis, diets,"
10093.37,"et cetera, and the"
endocrine,system?
10095.895,CHRIS PALMER: The
real,"answer is,"
10097.27,I don't think anybody knows.
10098.71,And there's not a
one-size-fits-all,answer
10101.41,because I've seen examples.
10104.94,And I'm aware of science to back
up,polar opposite conclusions.
10113.07,So the first general
observation,that I'll make--
10115.97,"I know so many couples,"
husbands,"and wives,"
10120.41,"boyfriends and girlfriends,"
heterosexual,"couples,"
10124.58,who have tried the ketogenic
diet,to lose weight together--
10127.893,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
end,up with a baby?
10129.56,"No, I'm just kidding."
10130.18,[LAUGHS]
10130.51,CHRIS PALMER: No.
10131.218,"Almost universally, the men"
have,a much easier time with it
10134.56,than the women.
10138.005,It's not across the board.
10139.49,But I know so many examples
where,the women say
10142.97,I couldn't tolerate that diet.
10145.73,It did not make me feel better.
10148.08,It actually made me feel worse.
10150.26,And I think in those
"cases,",it probably
10152.57,does relate to hormones.
10155.75,I'm aware of animal
"models,",of mice--
10159.35,"in particular, ketogenic"
diet,in mouse models.
10163.16,"One researcher shared with me,"
the,thing that was striking
10167.39,is that the female
mice,never got pregnant
10171.53,on the ketogenic diet.
10173.79,"Whereas, the mice"
on,the standard diet
10175.91,were just having
babies,right and left.
10177.86,And it was just
"shocking,",the difference.
10182.16,"On the surface, it makes sense."
10185.07,The ketogenic diet is
mimicking,the fasting state.
10189.56,Women who are
trying,to reproduce
10191.57,should not be fasting.
10194.87,If your body is in
a,"fasting state,"
10197.84,it probably does not
want,"to expend resources,"
10202.55,"metabolic resources, calories,"
"nutrients,","and other things,"
10206.96,to creating a baby
because,your very life is
10210.8,being threatened
"by,","quote unquote,"
10213.62,"""fasting"" or starvation."
10216.41,That even though
the,ketogenic diet
10218.75,"is a sustainable,"
nonstarvation,"diet,"
10221.66,we're really using
that,diet to trick
10223.79,the body into thinking that it
is,in a fasting or starvation
10227.99,state.
10229.22,And so just from a kind
of,"evolutionary stance,"
10233.51,it makes sense that
women's,bodies may actually
10237.26,have significant changes
in,hormonal status
10240.38,to prevent pregnancy
because,a woman should not
10244.49,be having a baby when
she's,starving to death.
10249.97,I know of examples of women
who,"are the opposite, though,"
10255.83,who have benefited
dramatically,and tremendously
10259.99,from the ketogenic
"diet,",have put
10262.51,"schizophrenia, bipolar"
disorder,into full remission.
10265.12,And I do actually know of
one,"case, at least one case."
10269.12,"A woman, infertile,"
she,and her husband
10272.08,had been trying for three
"years,",no pregnancy.
10275.23,She went keto.
10276.58,"Within four months,"
she,was pregnant.
10280.85,How do I make sense of that?
10282.62,I don't know.
10283.58,"And unfortunately, I"
don't,think we really
10286.04,have good control data on what
does,the ketogenic diet do
10292.31,"to male hormonal systems, what"
does,the ketogenic diet do
10296.27,to female hormonal systems.
10299.21,"But clearly, I think"
changes,are happening.
10306.61,I don't have a way to
predict,"it, at least."
10308.44,If somebody else has great
"insights,",I welcome them.
10311.45,But I haven't seen
them,published.
10313.27,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
a,terrific answer
10314.895,because when things are all over
the,"place and bidirectional,"
10317.71,depending on one
circumstance,"or the other,"
10319.88,I think it screams for
controlled,"studies,"
10323.11,and more descriptions
of,"case studies,"
10325.93,"and anecdotal data, too."
10327.53,So I think it's an
excellent,answer.
10329.53,It also calls to mind the
important,public service
10333.13,announcement that because of
these,bidirectional effects
10336.04,"that you described,"
please,don't use
10337.96,fasting or the ketogenic
diet,as a reliable form
10340.312,of contraception.
10341.02,CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
10342.21,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Yes,",please don't.
10343.99,I have a final
"question,",which relates
10347.38,to something that is very much
starting,to get buzz now--
10352.48,and maybe more so
for,people that
10354.16,hang out in the Twitter
space,or the nutrition space.
10356.92,But there's a new
class,of drugs that I
10359.71,think initially were
developed,to treat diabetes
10364.03,but are now being evaluated
for,their efficacy
10367.84,to treat obesity.
10369.22,And these are the semaglutide
drugs,that are involved in--
10377.98,they tap into these glucagon
related,GLP-1 pathways.
10382.03,And it is a story that we've
talked,about a little bit
10385.39,on the podcast before.
10386.38,"But many people, I"
"imagine,",probably
10387.97,haven't heard that conversation.
10389.5,I would simply like to know what
you,think about these drugs.
10393.37,They obviously adjust the way
that,glucose and insulin are
10397.39,"managing energy, both in"
the,"body and the brain,"
10400.96,and can produce weight loss.
10402.91,"So that to me, when I look"
at,"the data, it's impressive."
10406.33,But a good logical shift
in,diet and exercise
10412.75,could achieve
similar,weight loss.
10414.28,But a lot of people
just,won't do that.
10415.905,So the question I have
"is,",what are your thoughts
10418.57,on semaglutide and other GLP--
10420.818,I think I might have said
GLT,"before, excuse me--"
10422.86,GLP-1 related compounds?
10426.16,And do you ever prescribe
these,in conjunction
10430.03,with these dietary shifts?
10431.47,Because it seems
to,"me, they would"
10432.97,fall right in with the
catalog,of other approaches
10436.39,that you have available.
10439.155,CHRIS PALMER: The
real,"answer is,"
10440.53,I am not at all an expert
on,these medications.
10444.558,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what
are,your thoughts about them?
10446.85,They seem to be
weight,"loss drugs,"
10448.44,not unlike the fen-phen
drugs,of the '90s that
10451.56,then were banned because a few
people,didn't handle them well.
10454.682,CHRIS PALMER: They are.
10459.33,We had fen-phen.
10460.5,And even before
"that,","in the 1950s,"
10462.72,"and '60s, and '70s, Dexedrine--"
10465.142,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine.
10466.35,CHRIS PALMER: Amphetamine--
10467.04,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Mother's,little helper.
10467.97,"CHRIS PALMER: --was,"
"yes,",was the treatment
10469.92,of choice for women
across,the United States
10473.49,to keep their slim figures.
10475.95,And we created addicts
and,all sorts of problems.
10480.33,But they were widely used and
probably,millions of women
10484.05,because they work.
10486.127,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because
they,kill appetite.
10487.96,CHRIS PALMER: They
kill,appetite.
10494.57,My overall thoughts are this.
10496.7,There is zero doubt in my
mind,that the obesity epidemic
10502.94,is a threat to human health and
potentially,the human species.
10508.69,If it keeps going at
the,"rate it's going,"
10511.54,it is a threat to our species.
10515.88,We have to figure out what
on,"Earth is happening,"
10518.73,and what can we do about it.
10523.3,"These medications,"
in,"early studies,"
10527.49,are highly effective
over,a year or two.
10534.31,That's promising.
10537.55,"I am worried, though,"
that,we're not attacking
10541.57,the root cause of obesity.
10546.4,If the root cause
of,obesity ends up
10549.31,being some kind of poisoning
of,the metabolic machinery
10555.77,in the brain or body--
10558.08,and I would argue that probably
relates,to mitochondrial health
10562.16,and mitochondrial function--
10564.86,I have every reason to believe
that,taking a medication that
10570.01,helps you lose weight may not
be,addressing that problem.
10577.41,"And therefore, may"
not,be addressing
10580.38,all of the negative health
consequences,of what
10584.01,we call obesity.
10587.4,"So obesity, in it"
of,"itself, we know"
10589.68,that excess fat can
become,inflammatory
10593.55,"and can cause problems,"
in,and of itself.
10596.04,But I actually see
obesity,as a symptom.
10600.75,I see obesity as a symptom
of,metabolic derangement
10604.41,in the body or brain.
10607.04,And that is why
people,become obese.
10610.63,And that if we're really
going,"to get anywhere,"
10612.73,we need to identify
what,is causing
10614.89,that metabolic derangement.
10617.82,Using a symptomatic treatment
like,"a GLP-1 medication,"
10628.23,to the best of my
"knowledge,",is not addressing
10630.6,that core problem.
10632.82,And we're just ignoring it.
10635.55,Maybe I'll be wrong.
10637.05,And maybe these will
be,the wonder drug that
10639.84,saved the human
"species,",and everybody
10642.15,will be thin and healthy
forever,and ever.
10646.33,"I'm not hopeful, because"
we've,never-- we've
10649.59,had so many promising
drugs,come along.
10653.22,"Fen-Phen, Dexedrine,"
and,"other things,"
10655.5,we've had so many
promising,drugs.
10659.81,And at the end of
the,"day, when you"
10661.28,try to muck with
human,metabolism using
10663.59,a single processed
"molecule,","manmade,"
10668.96,I can't think of even one
example,where it's been great
10675.65,for large numbers of people.
10678.56,"Certainly,"
manufacturing,insulin is
10681.05,life-saving for people
with,type 1 diabetes.
10684.33,So that would be an example.
10686.45,But giving massive
doses,of insulin
10688.76,"to people with type 2 diabetes,"
actually,is a downward spiral.
10693.76,I would much rather see people
with,type 2 diabetes control
10696.55,their diabetes through
diet,and lifestyle.
10699.01,And that might be a ketogenic
"diet,","or a low carb diet,"
10701.96,"or exercise or good sleep,"
or,all of the other thing.
10705.85,All of it.
10707.46,I'd much rather see
that,because when
10709.26,people try to control their
type,"2 diabetes with a molecule,"
10712.3,even though it's a
natural,"molecule insulin,"
10714.84,we know that thats results
in,really poor health
10718.26,"consequences, results"
in,higher rates
10720.87,of cardiovascular
"disease,",higher
10722.46,rates of mental
"disorders,",higher
10724.32,rates of premature mortality.
10726.75,Do I think GLP-1 molecules
are,going to be different?
10731.46,No.
10732.0,I don't have any reason to
think,they are going to be.
10735.36,So that would be my two
"cents,",but we'll see.
10739.15,Time will tell.
10740.297,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Time will tell.
10741.63,"Meanwhile, I want to"
thank,you for doing
10745.08,"what is, without"
"question,",pioneering work.
10750.75,"Again, I'm not a clinician."
10752.25,But I've been around
this,space long enough
10755.64,to know that indeed there
there,are no wonder drugs.
10759.57,There are drugs that certainly
can,help alleviate symptoms
10762.78,in some individuals.
10764.98,But that lifestyle and in
the,case of your work--
10768.89,"in particular, in the"
discussion,today--
10770.63,"diet and, the ketogenic diet,"
in,"particular, it's clear,"
10775.82,can have incredible
"effects,","miraculous effects,"
10778.82,in some individuals.
10780.32,And positive effects
in,others that
10782.66,might not be of
the,same magnitude
10784.25,but nonetheless are
extremely,"important,"
10786.84,"so on behalf of myself, and the"
"listeners,","and and certainly,"
10791.18,just on behalf of everybody out
there--,because everyone does
10795.29,need to be concerned about
mental,"health issues,"
10797.908,whether or not they have them
and,in their family themselves.
10800.45,"Or otherwise, because"
they,impact everybody.
10802.61,Just really want to thank
you,for viewing the work
10804.693,that you're doing because
it,really is pioneering.
10807.44,And it's brave.
10808.82,"And I can see now, based on our"
"discussion,",why it would work.
10815.54,You've given us a lot of hints
into,the underlying mechanisms
10819.48,that suggest as to
why,it would work.
10821.58,And you're going to
given,us examples
10823.38,as to how it has worked
in,patients that you've
10826.2,worked with.
10826.74,And this field is
expanding,fast.
10829.17,I think this is an area
of,psychiatry and medicine
10831.87,in general.
10832.492,"Meaning, behavioral,"
nutritional,"interventions,"
10834.45,that is expanding very fast.
10836.16,So thank you for being brave and
for,"taking this on, and doing"
10840.72,"it in such a structured way,"
and,for communicating it
10843.39,here today.
10843.89,And with the general
"public,","through your book,"
10845.848,and your online presence.
10847.02,We will certainly point
people,in the direction
10848.978,of those valuable resources.
10851.26,Thanks so much.
10852.03,"CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, I know."
10852.43,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I,appreciate it.
10853.18,"CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew,"
for,being brave and having me
10855.763,on your [LAUGHS] show--
10856.847,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And a pleasure.
10858.18,CHRIS PALMER: --and for
a,great conversation.
10860.132,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you for
joining,me for my discussion
10862.59,with Dr. Chris Palmer.
10863.94,I hope you found it to be
as,"informative, actionable,"
10866.94,and exciting in terms of
the,various treatments
10869.61,that we can now think about
when,considering treatments
10873.0,for psychiatric disorders.
10874.38,"Once again, if you're interested"

10926.4,we do discuss supplements
because,while supplements
10929.16,aren't necessary for
"everybody,",many people
10931.29,derive tremendous
benefit,from them
10932.82,for things like enhancing
