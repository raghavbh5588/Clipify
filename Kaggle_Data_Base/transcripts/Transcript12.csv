0.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome
to,the Huberman Lab podcast
2.25,where we discuss science
and,science-based tools
4.68,for everyday life.
5.43,[MUSIC PLAYING]
9.13,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
and,I'm a professor
10.96,of neurobiology
and,ophthalmology
13.09,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.86,"Today, my guest is"
Dr.,Kyle Gillett.
17.29,Dr. Kyle Gillett is a dual
board,certified physician
20.14,in family medicine and
obesity,medicine and an expert
23.53,in hormone optimization.
25.15,He is an M.D--
26.68,"that is, a medical doctor--"
28.18,and he treats patients
with,a variety
30.01,"of backgrounds, ages and goals."
32.59,"Today, we discuss male"
hormone,optimization.
35.53,"We discuss behavioral tools,"
nutrition-based,"tools,"
39.19,"supplement-based tools,"
prescription-drug-based,"tools,"
42.61,and their interactions in
determining,overall levels
46.27,"of testosterone,"
free,"testosterone,"
48.79,"dihydrotestosterone, estrogen,"
growth,"hormone, thyroid"
52.33,"hormone, and many other"
hormones,"that impact mood,"
55.33,"libido, well-being,"
"strength,","cognition,"
58.9,and various
psychological,factors.
61.3,We've covered
hormone,optimization
62.98,in both men and women
in,previous episodes
65.17,"of the Huberman Lab podcast,"
but,today's discussion
67.96,is different.
69.16,Dr. Kyle Gillett offers very
specific,recommendations
72.07,for people with different
goals,and of different ages.
75.85,And we get deep
into,"the weeds of,"
78.01,"for instance, how does"
one,know whether or not
80.53,their testosterone is optimized
or,"not, how often to test"
84.46,for specific hormones
such,as testosterone
86.41,"and other hormones, and"
"really,",how to gauge
89.35,how good one should feel?
91.787,This is something that's often
overlooked,in discussions
94.12,about hormone optimization
or,health optimization
96.79,"of any kind, for that matter."
98.35,"For instance, people will"
talk,about reduced libido
101.71,and discuss whether or not
testosterone,levels are
104.35,"to blame, but how does"
one,calibrate their libido
107.038,in the first place?
107.83,"That is, how does one know"
whether,or not their libido is
110.53,"normal, too low, or too high?"
113.81,"We also discuss, for"
"instance,",whether or not
115.75,hormone optimization should
be,pursued continually
118.292,throughout the
year--,"for instance,"
119.75,whether or not you should
cycle,on and off supplements
122.08,and/or prescription drugs geared
towards,hormone optimization.
125.63,And we discuss the
behavioral,foundations
128.47,of optimal hormone function.
130.18,These are things that
every,male should be doing
132.34,and various things
they,should actively
134.32,avoid if their goal is to
have,"healthy hormones and to,"
137.98,"quote, unquote, optimize"
their,levels of every hormone
141.64,from growth hormone
to,testosterone
143.59,at any stage of life.
144.807,And while today's discussion
is,about male hormone
146.89,"optimization, I"
want,to emphasize
148.33,that we discuss all the
various,ages for male hormone
151.48,optimization.
152.69,So for those of you that are
"parents,",for those of you that
155.89,"are young, those of you that"
are,"middle aged, or old,"
158.11,"or teenagers, we explore"
"adolescent,","puberty,"
163.42,"teen and late teens, early"
"adulthood,","adulthood,"
166.51,and into the late
geriatric,ages.
168.778,So regardless of
your,age and whether
170.32,or not you are male or
"female,",today's episode
172.93,ought to be of interest to you.
174.4,I should also point out
that,we will soon also
176.89,be hosting an expert guest on
female,hormone optimization.
180.46,One thing that I'm
certain,people of all ages
182.47,and biological sex will enjoy
about,today's conversation
186.04,is that we also get
into,descriptions
187.84,of how psychology and life
events,impact hormones
191.2,and how hormones impact
our,psychology and the way
194.08,that we show up to
various,life events.
196.03,So today is really
a,broad overview
198.52,that goes all the way down to
fine,details about male hormone
202.0,optimization.
202.69,And I'm certain that by
the,"end of today's episode,"
205.04,you will have an immense amount
of,new information about how
208.09,"this endocrine-- that is,"
hormone,system in your body
210.91,works--
211.45,and how it interacts with
your,brain and other tissues
215.14,"and many, many actionable tools"
that,you can pursue regardless
219.34,of stage of life.
220.27,"Before we begin, I'd"
like,to emphasize
221.95,that this podcast is separate
from,my teaching and research
224.408,roles at Stanford.
225.19,"It is, however, part"
of,my desire and effort
227.23,to bring zero cost to
consumer,information
229.24,about science and
science-related,tools
231.4,to the general public.
232.45,In keeping with
that,"theme, I'd like"
233.95,to thank the sponsors
of,today's podcast.
236.39,Our first sponsor is Thesis.
238.51,Thesis makes custom nootropics.
240.73,And as I've said many times
before,"on this podcast,"
243.55,I am not a fan of
the,"word nootropics,"
245.8,because it means smart
"drugs,","and frankly, there"
248.74,are no specific neural circuits
in,"the brain or body for being,"
252.13,"quote, unquote, smart."
253.39,Thesis understands
"this,",and they've
255.37,developed custom nootropics
that,are designed
257.637,to bring your brain and
body,into the state that's
259.72,ideal for what you
need,to accomplish.
262.208,They use the highest
quality,ingredients-- things
264.25,"like phosphatidylserine,"
alpha,"GPC, many ingredients"
267.505,that I've talked about
before,on this podcast
269.38,and that I happen to use myself.
271.12,I've been using Thesis
for,"over a year now,"
272.98,and I can confidently say
that,their nootropics have
275.147,been a game changer.
276.25,"For me, I like their"
nootropic,for clarity.
279.22,I used that before
cognitive,work often.
281.41,And I like their
nootropic,"for energy,"
283.547,and I often used
that,"before workouts,"
285.13,"and in particular, workouts"
that,are especially intense.
288.465,To get your own personalized
nootropic,"starter kit,"
290.59,go online to
"takethesis.com/huberman,",
293.038,"take their 3-minute quiz,"
and,Thesis will send you four
295.33,different formulas to
try,in your first month.
297.49,"Again, that's"
"takethesis.com/huberman,",
300.31,and use the code Huberman
at,checkout to get 10% off
303.19,your first box.
304.12,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by ROKA.
306.58,ROKA makes eyeglasses
and,sunglasses
308.83,that are of the absolute
highest,quality.
310.93,The company was founded
by,2 All-American swimmers
313.15,"from Stanford, and everything"
about,ROKA eyeglasses
315.73,and sunglasses were designed
with,performance in mind.
318.58,I've spent a lifetime
working,on the biology
320.45,"of the visual system,"
and,I can tell you
321.97,that your visual
system,has to contend
323.593,with an enormous number
of,challenges in order
325.51,"for you to see clearly,"
for,"instance, when you move"
327.635,from a sunny area
to,a shady area
329.01,"and back again, whether or not"
you're,looking at something up
331.552,close or off into the distance.
332.86,ROKA understands the biology
of,"the visual system,"
335.32,and has designed their
eyeglasses,and sunglasses
337.54,accordingly so that you always
see,with perfect clarity.
340.3,ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses,were initially
342.46,designed for activities
such,"as running and cycling,"
345.737,"and indeed, they are"
very,lightweight.
347.32,"Most of the time, I"
can't,even remember
348.73,that they're on my face
they're,so lightweight.
350.59,But the important thing to
know,about ROKA eyeglasses
352.84,and sunglasses is
that,while they
354.46,can be used during
sports,"activities,"
356.95,they also have a
terrific,aesthetic
359.02,and they can be
used,just as well
360.64,"for wearing to work, or"
out,"to dinner, et cetera."
363.82,If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses,"and sunglasses,"
366.4,you can go to roka--
that's,R-O-K-A--
368.065,.com and enter the code Huberman
to,save 20% off on your first
372.23,order.
372.73,"Again, that's roka-- R-O-K-A--"
.com,and enter the code
375.85,Huberman at checkout.
377.17,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Helix Sleep.
379.84,Helix makes
mattresses,and pillows
381.61,that are of the absolute
highest,quality.
383.5,I started sleeping on a Helix
mattress,"well over a year ago,"
386.32,and it's been the best
sleep,that I've ever had.
388.87,One of the things that makes
Helix,mattresses so unique
391.42,is that they match the
design,of the mattress
393.37,to your unique sleep needs.
394.722,"So for instance, if you"
go,on to their website.
396.68,You can take a brief quiz.
397.763,It only takes about
two,"or three minutes,"
399.73,and you'll answer
questions,like do
400.9,you tend to run hot or
cold,"throughout the night,"
402.91,or whether or not you sleep
on,"your back, your side,"
405.077,"or your stomach, or"
maybe,you don't know.
406.9,"Regardless, they will match"
you,to the custom mattress
409.69,that ideal for your sleep needs.
411.34,"For me, that was the dusk--"
412.51,"D-U-S-K-- mattress which,"
for,"me, was not too firm,"
415.24,"not too soft, and was ideal"
for,my sleep patterns.
418.27,You take the quiz
and,you'll find out
419.86,what mattress is ideal
for,your sleep patterns.
422.15,So if you're interested in
upgrading,"your mattress,"
424.275,"go to helixsleep.com/huberman,"
take,"their brief sleep quiz,"
427.202,and they'll match you to
a,"customized mattress,"
429.16,and you'll get up to $200 off
any,mattress order and two free
432.46,pillows.
433.018,They have a 10 year
"warranty,",and you
434.56,get to try out the mattress
for,100 nights risk-free.
437.165,"Again, if you're"
"interested,",you can go
438.79,to helixsleep.com/huberman for
up,to $200 off and two free
442.82,pillows.
443.32,The Huberman Lab
podcast,is now partnered
445.09,with Momentous Supplements.
446.29,To find the supplements we
discuss,on the Huberman Lab
448.54,"podcast, you can go to"
livemomentous--,spelled O-U-S--
451.45,livemomentous.com/huberman.
453.69,And I should just
mention,that the library
455.44,of those supplements is
constantly,expanding.
457.57,"Again, that's"
livemomentous.com/huberman.,
460.63,"And now, for my discussion"
with,Dr. Kyle Gillett.
464.17,"Dr. Gillett, great"
to,have you back.
465.948,KYLE GILLETT: Great to be back.
467.24,Thank you.
468.26,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to
begin,with a question about one
470.76,of the most mysterious and
important,"phases of life, which"
475.68,is puberty.
477.48,I've long wondered whether or
not,how quickly somebody goes
482.13,into puberty-- so at what age--
484.2,and how long puberty
takes--,so how
486.9,brief or protracted
that,puberty is
488.52,for them to acquire the
so-called,secondary sexual
491.22,"characteristics,"
things,like hair growth
493.29,on the face for males and
changes,"in bone, and muscle"
497.19,"density, and growth, et cetera."
499.23,When I was in middle
school,"and high school,"
501.672,I noticed that some people
transitioned,into all that
503.88,very fast and some people
took,a long time to acquire
507.72,those characteristics.
509.33,Can we learn anything about
"ourselves,","our hormones,"
514.0,and maybe even how
long,we're going
515.77,to live based on the time
in,which we enter puberty
519.28,and how long it takes us to
progress,through puberty?
522.09,And I guess that also
raises,"the question,"
523.84,does puberty ever truly end?
526.66,KYLE GILLETT: There are
many,takeaways from puberty.
529.03,Some of the actionable items
from,"it are, yes, it can"
534.19,and does affect your adult
height,and also stature
538.09,and also body composition.
540.74,So puberty is a time--
542.935,and if we're talking
specifically,"about males,"
547.15,"think of it as a time where,"
if,"you have obesity as a child,"
553.0,you could potentially
use,that time
555.91,to change your lifestyle
and,"habits and reset things,"
558.61,and it is a bit easier.
560.57,It's almost like
a,free injection
563.56,of testosterone and metabolism
and,drive and effort
566.65,into your life.
567.94,There is a wide variation in how
quickly,puberty goes through.
573.26,So there are stages called
Tanner,"stages, which we don't"
576.13,necessarily need to get into.
577.7,But if you enter
puberty,"very early,"
580.18,then it can decrease your
adult,height or stature.
585.01,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for a
given,male that enters puberty
588.28,at 13 versus a male that
enters,"puberty at 15,"
592.3,can we say that the guy
that,entered puberty at 13
595.84,is going to be shorter than the
guy,"that entered puberty at 15,"
599.53,or it's not quite
that,straightforward?
601.42,KYLE GILLETT: If they
are,identical twins
603.67,and the individual
who,entered puberty
605.44,at age 13 also finished
"puberty,",went all the way
609.01,through the Tanner stages--
610.16,and if you do a bone
"scan,",which I believe
611.91,is usually done
on,"the left wrist,"
613.93,"and it says yes, your growth"
plates,"are mostly closed,"
616.45,you're not going to grow more
than,a couple inches of height
619.18,after that.
621.55,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Just
a,related question.
623.83,When I was growing
"up,","it was thought,"
626.44,"or at least people would say,"
that,resistance training--
629.8,"in particular,"
lifting,heavy weights
631.84,could stunt one's growth.
633.52,Is that true or false?
636.92,KYLE GILLETT: It is
false,when you're
638.78,talking about just
lifting,heavy weights.
640.64,Dirty bulking certainly
has,the potential to stunt
643.64,one's growth for
two,main mechanisms.
645.51,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could
you,define dirty bulking?
647.51,KYLE GILLETT: [CHUCKLES]
So,dirty bulking
649.52,is eating an excess of
calories,not just to acquire
654.11,lean metabolically active
body,"mass or get stronger,"
657.89,but purposely
acquiring,body fat.
662.58,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
purposely,acquiring muscle
664.94,and fat by overeating
and,lifting weights
669.08,can stunt one's growth.
670.67,Do I have that correct?
671.78,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
672.74,So it does two things.
674.51,If you're doing it as a
very,"young child, it can--"
677.45,that fat can become
leptin,resistant
680.54,and it can produce more
"leptin,",and that leptin
683.84,can activate the
"hypothalamus,",which
686.06,"activates the pituitary, which"
releases,"gonadotropin, which"
689.42,basically just
increase,testosterone
691.19,and estrogen earlier than
it,otherwise would have.
693.62,It's the same mechanism behind
why,childhood obesity causes
697.67,early puberty.
698.562,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
699.77,I do remember a paper
published,in Science Magazine--
702.74,I believe it was focused
mainly,"on females,"
704.99,but showing that when
enough,"body fat accumulates,"
708.003,the hormone leptin
is,"secreted, and that"
709.67,triggers the onset of puberty.
710.973,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
711.89,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Given the
increase,in childhood obesity
715.73,that we're observing
"now,",are we seeing
718.07,an earlier onset of puberty
in,males and females?
721.76,"KYLE GILLETT: Yes, in"
both,males and females.
723.998,Not to get too
"technical,",but there's
725.54,a G protein-coupled
receptor,on the hypothalamus
728.18,and leptin directly
binds,"it, so it"
730.34,does appear directly
cause,causatory and not
733.52,just correlation.
734.482,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And if
I,"understand correctly,"
736.44,what you're saying is
for,a young guy-- let's
739.88,"say, 13, 14-- who"
wants,to really bulk up
742.46,"and deliberately-- deliberately,"
excuse,"me-- overeats, and is"
745.933,"doing their squats, and"
"deadlifts,",and bench presses
748.1,"and really trying to get big,"
they,"will get big, but only"
752.57,in the lateral dimension.
754.01,They're effectively
limiting,their total height
757.94,and it can shut down the long
bone,growth of their limbs.
761.57,Is that correct?
762.47,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
763.387,The growth of the long
bones,is mostly related
765.8,to the estradiol alpha
"receptor,","so basically,"
768.53,one of the receptors
for,"estrogen,"
770.52,which can be secondary
to,early puberty and also
774.53,is related to body fat because
you,have that conversion
777.11,of testosterone to estrogen.
780.16,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So can we
assume,that if a young male
784.38,wants to get into resistance
training,that bodyweight
788.28,exercises are probably OK
and,maybe even some weight
791.82,"training, kettlebells,"
et,"cetera,"
793.56,but that they should avoid
doing,so-called dirty bulking--
796.8,trying to deliberately
gain,weight--
799.17,up until what age?
800.49,Until puberty is over?
803.07,KYLE GILLETT: I would say
an,individual should limit
805.47,the amount of abnormal
body,"fat accumulation,"
809.55,"or dirty bulking, indefinitely"
throughout,their entire life.
812.652,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: So again,"
if,"I understand correctly,"
814.86,that recommendation to
avoid,deliberate weight gain
818.25,or rapid weight gain is not
just,to allow an individual
823.02,"to reach their maximum height,"
but,also to avoid laying down
827.52,a lot of body fat cells.
828.78,Correct?
829.663,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
830.58,The balance between
that,"is, when"
832.71,you are going
through,"puberty, you"
834.51,are able to add a lot
of,lean body mass--
836.94,"not just muscle mass, but bone"
mass,and other mass as well.
840.505,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I started
lifting,"weights when I was 16,"
842.88,and I confess I trained
pretty,heavy at times.
846.702,I don't know whether
or,not I would
848.16,have been taller than
I,"am now, but when"
851.31,I started that
"training,",I had already
853.74,reached what was at least
close,to my predicted height.
857.94,I can't say that I deliberately
waited,until I had grown.
860.497,It just so happened that I
stumbled,into the weight room
862.83,and found that I liked it
at,"age 16, at which point,"
866.17,I was already the
height,that I am now.
868.2,"So in any case,"
what,I'm hearing is
870.96,that laying down a lot of excess
body,fat is not a good idea.
874.5,What if somebody grows up chubby
or,fat for whatever reason--
879.828,reasons related to the eating
patterns,"in their family,"
882.12,maybe even some genetic reasons.
883.77,Is it safe and/or wise
for,a young person--
888.12,so let's say somebody who's
around,"the age of puberty,"
891.09,"or even younger, or in their"
late,teens-- to be dieting
894.78,and actively trying
to,lose body fat.
896.46,Is that safe?
898.105,KYLE GILLETT: Under the
supervision,"of a physician,"
900.23,it is certainly safe to
change,your body composition.
903.14,In pediatric obesity
"medicine,",you're
905.78,often talking about
a,recomposition
908.42,or a renormalization of the
growth,curve compared to peers.
912.842,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
913.8,Thank you.
914.45,"So as you may have sensed,"
we,started chronologically
917.54,"with puberty, and"
I,know that there's
919.25,another puberty that even
precedes,the puberty that we're
922.13,all familiar with.
923.248,Maybe-- if you want to
just,briefly mention
925.04,that because I was talking
with,you about this
926.957,before we started.
927.83,The puberty that I'm
most,"familiar with,"
930.462,and I think most people
are,"most familiar with,"
932.42,the acquisition of
deepening,"of the voice,"
935.0,"growth of muscle and bone, body"
"hair,",acquisition of libido
939.465,and things like that.
940.34,That's actually the second
puberty,that we all go through.
942.923,Maybe would just mention
for,us and educate us
944.84,on the first puberty.
945.95,I think most people
will,be hearing
949.19,this for the very first time.
950.87,KYLE GILLETT: The first
puberty,of everyone's life
953.15,is the first three
months,of their life.
955.19,You may notice that your baby
has,more acne the first three
959.18,"months and that they also have,"
in,"general, just more changes"
964.31,related to androgens and
"estrogens,","perhaps oilier skin,"
969.5,even more genitourinary--
971.57,genital growth during
the,first three months.
974.43,"And this is mostly due to DHEA,"
which,is an adrenal hormone.
978.62,"The second puberty,"
or,the puberty
980.108,"that most people know of,"
actually,starts that same way
982.4,as well.
983.31,"It's called adrenarche, and"
it's,"when the adrenals kick in,"
987.47,"I guess, for the second time."
988.97,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there
a,standard age or age
991.13,range in which the
testicles,descend in males?
995.3,KYLE GILLETT:
Usually,before birth.
997.01,It is not uncommon to have one
or,"even two undescended testes,"
1001.57,but there is a risk
of,"testicular cancer,"
1003.71,especially if they are
not,fixed early and also
1006.49,heat damage to the teste.
1008.687,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,"
thank,you for that coverage
1010.77,of the two puberties.
1011.91,So early in life.
1012.81,I imagine some of our
listeners,probably
1015.45,"still in one or the-- well,"
one,or the other puberty.
1018.055,The ones that are in
the,"first puberty,"
1019.68,"obviously, aren't"
aware,that they're
1021.06,listening to this
"podcast,",but maybe it'll
1022.86,be embedded in
their,subconscious.
1024.599,But some listeners probably
are,still in puberty.
1027.276,But I think everyone can
remember,"back to their puberty,"
1029.609,and roughly when they
first,"entered puberty,"
1031.53,and how quickly they
aggregated,the secondary sex
1034.56,characteristics.
1035.94,I'd like to turn now to a
general,question about what
1039.69,all males ought to do in order
to,optimize their hormones.
1043.963,So if you could just
list,off the things
1045.63,that all males should do on
a,"daily basis, weekly basis."
1049.59,"I mean, should guys"
in,their teens and 20s
1051.75,be getting their bloodwork
"done,",should they
1054.09,be taking supplements?
1055.153,We already talked
about,weight training.
1056.82,What should they be doing
and,what should they
1058.737,avoid doing if the
goal,is to have
1060.63,a long arc of healthy
hormone,optimization
1063.42,throughout the lifespan?
1065.14,KYLE GILLETT: There's many
things,that you should do.
1067.72,An analogy that I
often,make is when
1070.24,there's a brand new car that
comes,"off the assembly line,"
1072.94,you do a full scope
of,diagnostic workup--
1075.31,hook it up to the computer.
1076.66,And I think we should do the
same,thing with humans as well.
1079.45,"During puberty, obviously,"
you're,"a functioning human,"
1083.05,but I would say there's
still,development.
1086.24,And I think that the
human,always develops.
1088.81,I don't think
development,"ever ends,"
1090.52,but you want to
monitor,that progress
1092.59,across a person's lifespan.
1096.78,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
1097.74,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry."
1098.865,"So for bloodwork-- I mean,"
what,would be the earliest--
1102.18,let me put it this way.
1103.32,If blood work didn't cost
anything,and everyone
1107.97,"could get it, when"
would,you want
1109.59,to see everybody get
their,bloodwork done
1111.48,for the first time?
1113.67,"Obviously, individuals"
under,the age of 18
1116.25,should talk with their
parents,about this.
1118.57,And as long as the
parents,and the child
1122.34,agree and the parents are
on,"board with this as well,"
1125.04,you can start getting bloodwork.
1127.44,"Often, a child will"
come,in with complaints
1129.93,of either precocious
puberty,"or delayed puberty,"
1132.81,and this individual might be 9
or,this individual might be 15.
1137.55,For a healthy
"child,",when they're
1140.19,going through their later
Tanner,stages-- which
1142.53,"is 4 and 5, so they've developed"
several,secondary sexual
1145.02,characteristics-- they might
have,hair growth or starting
1148.98,to notice more beard growth.
1151.74,That's a good time to do it.
1154.0,If you're concerned
with,"stature or heighth,"
1156.63,or if you're not
tracking,along where most
1158.94,members of your family have--
1161.19,not just their height
and,"stature, but also"
1164.01,"the timing of their puberty,"
then,that's time to get labs.
1168.66,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I
could,"travel back in time,"
1171.61,I would have gotten my bloodwork
done,"for hormones, and lipids,"
1174.54,and everything else at 18.
1176.46,"I, unfortunately, didn't know"
where,"and how to get that,"
1179.34,and I didn't have any
pressing,clinical issues.
1181.48,And so I think the first time
that,"I got my bloodwork done,"
1184.2,"I was in my late 20s,"
maybe,even in my early 30s.
1187.74,And I'm still dying to
know,what my bloodwork was
1191.28,"when, for instance, I was"
17,and I felt a certain way.
1194.4,And I confess that
in,"many dimensions,"
1197.82,I actually feel better now at--
1199.74,I'll be 47 soon-- at 47 than
I,did in my teens and 20s.
1203.46,And I think it was more
on,the psychological side.
1206.16,I think that-- but in
terms,of just understanding
1210.21,why we felt great or why we
felt,or feel terrible or not so
1215.31,"great, I think bloodwork"
is,extremely informative.
1217.83,What do you think
are,the key things
1219.78,to look for in bloodwork?
1221.16,"I mean, testosterone is"
always,the topic that comes up
1223.74,in the context of male
hormone,"optimisation,"
1225.6,but certainly there are
a,lot of other hormones
1227.558,that are important as well.
1228.76,KYLE GILLETT: And
with,"testosterone, you"
1230.427,want to get either
testosterone,and an SHBG
1232.47,or a free testosterone.
1233.695,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you
define,"SHBG for our listeners,"
1236.07,please?
1236.37,KYLE GILLETT: It is Sex
Hormone,Binding Globulin.
1238.412,It is the protein that
binds,up all androgens
1241.68,and estrogen in the body.
1243.22,"So the stronger the androgen,"
the,stronger it binds.
1246.39,"During puberty,"
strong,"androgens,"
1249.42,especially DHT which
is,the strongest
1251.67,"bioidentical androgen,"
has,a huge role--
1255.81,a prominent role in secondary
sexual,characteristics.
1259.14,And if your SHBG is
very,"high, then your DHT"
1262.62,can run higher because
it's,"not metabolized,"
1265.08,but there's not quite
as,much free DHT.
1267.48,So you want to balance
between,a high enough free DHT
1272.25,and a high enough total DHT.
1273.568,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
"obviously,",these blood tests
1275.61,are going to have to
be,read and interpreted
1277.62,by a qualified physician.
1279.15,Most people aren't going to be
in,a position to evaluate them
1281.768,"properly, or at least not with"
the,full depth that they could
1284.31,if they had an M.D like
yourself,looking at them.
1287.64,So everyone should get
bloodwork,as early as possible
1291.06,depending on their
budget,and availability.
1293.94,What should
everybody,do in terms
1297.15,of monitoring those markers?
1299.04,So assuming that there's
no,"major intervention,"
1301.62,how often do you
recommend,that people
1303.57,get their bloodwork done?
1306.138,KYLE GILLETT: Let's say--
1307.18,let's take an individual
who,"just turned 18,"
1309.07,they just got their
first,set of bloodwork.
1310.78,They'll probably
find,something in it
1312.322,that they may want to optimize
using,shared decision-making
1315.52,with their physician.
1317.14,"Usually, a good follow-up"
is,about six months.
1320.02,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So twice a
"year,","getting bloodwork done,"
1322.62,and then having a
physician,evaluate it.
1324.762,That sounds reasonable to me.
1325.97,And for those that didn't
initiate,"this at 18,"
1328.51,"such as myself, I guess"
the,best time to start then
1331.36,would be as soon as possible.
1332.92,KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
1334.345,ANDREW HUBERMAN: In
terms,of the other things
1336.22,"that all males should do,"
meaning,all males of all ages--
1340.48,puberty and beyond-- what
are,some of those things?
1345.14,"So on a daily basis,"
maybe,you could just
1347.53,take us through the arc
of,a day and push out
1350.83,some of the protocols
that,you use
1352.42,or the things that you like
to,see your male patients
1354.628,use in order to try and
optimize,their hormone status.
1357.365,KYLE GILLETT: I'll briefly
touch,on some of the lifestyle
1359.74,pillars to start.
1360.76,Diet and exercise
are,the first to.
1363.58,"In puberty, sleep is"
particularly,"important,"
1365.89,of course.
1367.69,"But with diet and exercise,"
throughout,"a lifespan,"
1372.97,you want to not exclude
things,that are helping you.
1376.93,"For example, during"
puberty,if you're
1379.09,"consuming dairy, and then all of"
a,"sudden you cut out all dairy,"
1381.91,dairy can help increase
IGF-1,and free IGF-1.
1385.005,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: And just,"
"again,","for our audience,"
1387.13,maybe just mention what
having,enough IGF-1 can
1390.4,do for us that's beneficial is?
1392.047,KYLE GILLETT: It helps you grow.
1393.38,It helps with
genital,"development,"
1396.01,secondary sexual
"characteristics,",and long bone
1399.43,growth--
1400.48,"skin growth, hair"
"growth,",a host of things.
1402.89,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So getting
an,array of nutrients
1405.28,that include dairy.
1406.455,What other sorts
of,nutrients are
1407.83,important during development?
1410.363,KYLE GILLETT: You want to have
adequate,vitamin D. Vitamin
1412.78,D helps with
testosterone,"production,"
1414.49,"it helps, again, with bone"
mineralization,and stature.
1419.59,After an age of about 25--
1422.23,"and there's not a strict cutoff,"
but,"up to about an age of 25,"
1426.04,optimizing your growth
hormone,and IGF-1
1428.23,helps with bone density
and,bone growth.
1431.9,So from the dietary
"standpoint,",you
1434.23,want to have enough free
estrogen--,not too much
1437.17,when you're growing.
1438.01,But you want to help
basically,stockpile bone
1442.63,to prevent a risk of
osteoporosis,or thin bone
1445.72,fractures when you're older.
1447.64,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Well,",as someone
1449.015,who broke his left foot 5
times,"while in high school,"
1452.35,I can say that whatever
young,people can
1454.24,do to optimize their bone
density,would be great.
1456.88,That problem seems to have
resolved,"itself over time,"
1459.23,but I don't know.
1459.938,"Back then, I did a short"
run,"as a vegetarian,"
1462.79,but I've always
been,an omnivore.
1465.1,I realize that some
of,this relates
1466.84,"to ethics, and food allergies,"
and,things of that sort.
1469.28,But would you say
"that,","on balance,"
1472.39,most people would benefit from
eating,a combination of quality
1477.76,proteins from animal sources
and,non-animal sources--
1480.55,"fruits, vegetables,"
and,starches?
1482.603,"I mean, what do you"
"think,","for instance,"
1484.27,about people following a pure
carnivore,or a very pure vegan
1488.47,diet in their 20s and 30s?
1491.302,KYLE GILLETT: In
their,"late 20s, it"
1492.76,might be a reasonable option.
1494.71,In early 20s and
certainly,"teens,"
1497.06,it is a horrible idea because
it,is likely to significantly
1500.38,decrease your free androgens.
1502.12,So you will have less
testosterone,acting
1504.19,on receptors through the body.
1506.885,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are there
any,other micronutrients
1509.01,or macronutrients that
people,in their 20s and 30s
1511.74,should emphasize?
1513.825,KYLE GILLETT: We haven't really
touched,on fatty acids or fiber
1516.45,too much.
1517.44,Fiber is going to
be,paramount in kind
1520.11,of setting your set
point,of your gut
1522.09,microbiome the
rest,of your life.
1524.44,There is prebiotic
"fiber,",which you
1526.71,can think of as fish food
for,your good gut microbiome.
1530.25,Your gut microbiome is kind
of,like an aquarium or a fish
1532.81,tank.
1533.31,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now,"
I'm,just thinking
1533.97,about goldfish swimming around
in,that-- the goldfish eating
1536.68,people.
1537.18,"Don't eat goldfish, people--"
1538.537,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
1539.37,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --live or dead.
1540.93,"KYLE GILLETT: Yeah,"
but,any fiber or food
1543.84,that you're putting
in,"your gut, it's"
1545.4,either going to skew your gut
microbiome,toward something
1549.03,that is more beneficial
or,more detrimental.
1551.933,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And,would you say
1553.35,that the prebiotic fiber and
getting,"essential fatty acids,"
1557.73,that would be important to do
throughout,the lifespan or just
1560.58,for people in their 20s and 30s?
1562.26,KYLE GILLETT:
Throughout,"the lifespan,"
1563.85,particularly important in the
"teenage,","'20s, '30s, because it"
1567.69,helps with brain development.
1569.88,You're certainly more
of,an expert than me
1572.01,when it comes to
brain,"development,"
1574.65,but it does continue
to,"develop, really,"
1577.26,"throughout the lifespan, but"
certainly,through the 20s
1579.51,and 30s as well.
1580.618,ANDREW HUBERMAN: What
about,taking a multivitamin
1582.66,while you're growing up?
1583.66,So many people do that.
1585.66,"Is it necessary, is it useful?"
1587.62,"And if it's not necessary,"
is,it safe to do anyway?
1591.98,KYLE GILLETT: It's
generally,safe to do anyway.
1594.56,I do not think everybody
needs,a multivitamin.
1597.92,The more exclusionary
your,diet is--
1600.77,"for example, if you"
have,celiac disease
1603.65,or if you're planning on
fertility,"soon, then perhaps"
1606.38,it's more reasonable
to,take a multivitamin.
1608.36,ANDREW HUBERMAN: In a
previous,"discussion of ours,"
1610.443,I asked you about caloric
restriction,and testosterone.
1613.28,"And if I recall correctly, the"
idea,was that if somebody is
1616.61,overweight-- they have an
excess,"fat, adipose tissue--"
1619.37,then getting rid of some
of,that adipose tissue
1622.28,through caloric
restriction,"and exercise,"
1624.14,provided it's done not
too,"fast in a healthy way,"
1626.72,is going to be beneficial for
testosterone,in the long-run.
1629.99,But that for
individuals,who are not
1632.75,carrying an excess of body
"fat,",caloric restriction
1635.06,is actually going to
lower,testosterone.
1638.45,"First of all, do I"
have,that correct?
1640.28,"And second, are there"
any,addendums to that
1643.82,you'd like to give us now?
1646.52,KYLE GILLETT: That's correct.
1647.84,If you look at an individual
in,"a caloric deficit,"
1651.89,several changes will happen.
1653.49,One is that they'll have less
building,blocks for hormones.
1657.47,Another is that they will
be,in a catabolic state
1660.11,"more often, so that balance"
of,anabolism and catabolism
1663.56,will be different.
1664.55,They'll likely have less
signaling,from growth hormone
1667.67,"and IGF-1, and they'll"
also,have the high SHBG
1671.54,that we defined earlier
as,"the binding protein,"
1673.77,so their free androgens and
free,estrogens will go down.
1677.75,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
1678.86,So we touched on
sleep,being critical.
1681.238,I would say throughout
the,"lifespan, trying"
1683.03,to get enough quality
sleep,at least 80%
1686.24,of the nights of your
"life,",and the other 20%
1688.34,are just what happens
when,there's noise outside
1691.568,or you're stressed.
1692.36,It just-- you have
an,exam or you're
1694.22,having a great time
for,whatever reason.
1696.09,There are a lot of good
reasons,to lose some sleep
1698.24,now and again as well.
1700.1,"So we have sleep,"
we've,got nutrition.
1703.16,We touched on that.
1704.24,We'll get back into
supplementation.,
1706.455,"Now, what are some"
of,the other pillars
1708.08,of creating the proper
environment,for hormone
1710.66,optimization?
1713.35,KYLE GILLETT: Stress is
probably,the next one.
1715.78,"During both puberty, but"
also,"the 20s and 30s,"
1721.27,individuals are figuring out how
they,want to cope with stress
1724.99,and also figuring out
what,they want to choose
1727.39,to put their effort into.
1730.16,"So if someone is overstressed,"
then,it can have--
1732.91,it can put all the other
lifestyle,pillars--
1735.94,and then they stop dieting
"well,","they stop exercising,"
1739.87,and everything
else,can go askew.
1742.9,There is also some degree
of,"social component to this,"
1747.92,so perhaps I need to add a
seventh,pillar of social.
1752.17,"During your 20s and 30s, you"
may,be forming a family as well.
1755.5,"Perhaps you have children, and"
the,health of the family unit
1759.97,is going to be vitally
important,not only-- not
1763.18,necessarily directly for
hormone,"optimisation,"
1766.413,but it's going to
throw,everything
1767.83,else off if it's off.
1769.06,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
for,people that are not
1771.368,starting their own families
in,"their 20s and 30s,"
1773.41,can that social connection
be,extended to friendships
1776.38,and work relationships as well?
1778.038,KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely.
1779.08,"In fact, if someone's"
not,"starting a family,"
1781.75,"it is just as concerning,"
but,for other reasons.
1784.53,Each individual is going to
have,their close group of family
1787.03,and friends.
1787.88,And if someone does not have
one,"of those connections,"
1790.81,that's when things
can,potentially
1793.12,get bad not just for them
"individually,",but also society.
1796.553,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
when,"you say stress,"
1798.22,you mean learn to
manage,your stress.
1800.728,What does that look like?
1801.77,"I mean, if a patient"
has,"high blood pressure,"
1804.61,"or even if they don't, you just"
sense,that they're stressed.
1807.25,They have a lot of
pressured,"speech,"
1808.75,or they're not feeling
"well,",or communicating
1810.625,that they're not doing well.
1812.08,What are some of
the,things that you
1813.58,recommend in order to try
and,ameliorate that stress?
1816.365,KYLE GILLETT: There's different
mindfulness,or relaxation
1818.74,techniques.
1819.46,Going outside can often
help,with this as well.
1823.42,Dietary changes and exercise
can,help with this too.
1826.46,Some people like
prayer,or meditation.
1828.91,And a lot of people like
counseling,"or therapy,"
1832.66,or even just talking openly with
a,family member or a friend.
1836.545,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
What,would it be
1837.92,some of the other pillars
for,hormone optimization?
1840.47,"Here, I feel like we're not"
just,talking about people
1841.88,in their 20s and
"30s,","but again, we're"
1843.8,wrapping our arms around
basically,puberty onward.
1847.25,"I mean, gosh, looking"
"back,",I started
1849.367,"meditating pretty early,"
I,started weight training
1851.45,and running early.
1852.32,I gave some thought to
my,"diet in high school,"
1854.882,but it really was
in,college that I
1856.34,started thinking more about
what,I was ingesting and why
1859.34,and trying to do better there.
1860.88,But people are
coming,to the table
1862.58,at different stages
of,life and trying
1865.79,to optimize for hormones.
1867.19,So what would be some
of,the additional things
1869.51,that everybody should do?
1872.21,KYLE GILLETT: Everyone should
get,outside and find a movement
1875.72,pastime to last a lifetime.
1878.03,You're going to get
"sunlight,",you're
1879.53,going to get some degree
of,"heat and cold exposure,"
1882.33,and you're also just
going,to move more.
1884.51,Being in an artificial
"environment,",where there's
1887.09,artificial lights
artificial,"air conditioning,"
1890.48,is going to have many
effects,on your body.
1895.59,So that's vital.
1896.75,Another one is finding what
your,purpose is in life.
1900.39,"So I call this spirit,"
but,it's really
1902.51,just the self-actualization
component,of Maslow's hierarchy
1905.9,"of needs, which is basically"
your,"physical needs,"
1908.03,"your mental needs, and then"
your,purpose in life-- what
1910.322,you really like to do.
1911.455,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,"
picking,some goal or target.
1913.58,And I always say that
you,don't have to stick
1915.29,to the same goal over time.
1916.34,"Certainly, I haven't"
although,I got
1917.798,started early in the science
game,and I'm still in it.
1920.75,The idea is not to pick the
end,"goal, it is to pick a goal."
1925.17,And then once you reach that
goal,"to assess, and then"
1928.76,"pick another goal, and so on."
1930.24,"I think sometimes, when people"
hear,"about picking a purpose,"
1932.03,"they're like, oh, my"
"goodness,",I have to define--
1933.5,sort of like naming oneself--
1935.18,that you actually can change
your,goals and purpose
1939.08,over time.
1940.13,This is terrific.
1941.0,Would you suggest that
people,actively use
1945.2,or avoid supplementation
prior,to doing
1949.162,all these other things?
1950.12,I'm somebody that likes to throw
the,"kitchen sink at things,"
1952.25,but I also like to do things
pretty,systematically.
1954.375,So I would say behavior is
"first,","then nutrition, then"
1956.84,"supplementation, and then"
maybe,"if, and only if, there's"
1960.29,a real need--
1961.22,"and of course, working with a"
doctor--,prescription drugs.
1963.74,But there are probably
people,in their 20s or 30s--
1966.8,maybe even in their 50s--
1968.102,that aren't feeling
"great,",and they
1969.56,want to do something in order
to,be able to train more
1972.26,or to feel more confident to
seek,out social connection.
1976.01,They just try and go
about,the whole business
1979.01,from the other side as well.
1981.48,What are your thoughts on that?
1983.142,KYLE GILLETT: I see
supplements,and medications
1985.1,as very similar--
1986.27,one is prescribed
and,one is not.
1988.1,"In general, medications"
have,more side effects
1990.77,or potentially stronger
therapeutic,with more efficacy.
1994.73,But they are just tools
to,reach an end goal.
1997.85,So depending on the
"goal,",if there's
1999.68,an individual that's
an,"athlete, then"
2001.51,certainly they should
consider,supplementation.
2004.09,Or if someone desires
optimal,or a very high level
2009.33,"of cognitive performance,"
they,should also
2011.08,consider supplementation.
2012.49,"At the same time,"
food,"is medicine,"
2014.182,and a lot of the benefits
you,"can get in supplements,"
2016.39,you can get in food as well.
2017.8,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I,guess it depends
2018.43,on how much time and energy
you're,willing to spend
2020.555,and also finances.
2021.783,I know that when
I,"was in college,"
2023.2,I could afford just
a,"few supplements,"
2025.37,and they were basically whey
protein,and some fish oil--
2028.953,I was fortunate
that,I was pointed
2030.37,in the direction of those
things--,and some creatine.
2032.578,I couldn't afford much else.
2033.99,"Over time, of course,"
I,could afford more.
2035.74,But it really does often
depend,on finances.
2040.18,Before we get into some
specific,recommendations
2042.94,"to optimize testosterone,"
"estrogen,","thyroid,"
2046.03,"growth hormone, et"
"cetera,",I want to ask you
2048.13,a question I've been wondering
about,for a long time.
2050.51,So often in the discussion
about,"male hormone optimization,"
2053.409,"people will say, well, if"
your,"libido is suffering,"
2058.71,you might want to be
concerned,about testosterone--
2061.27,or even estrogen because we know
that,estrogen can impact libido
2064.12,as well.
2064.69,"Sometimes, having estrogen too"
low,is detrimental for libido.
2068.199,"Or that people will say, you're"
not,recovering from workouts
2070.96,or you're just you're
feeling,kind of depressed.
2072.67,"The problem is,"
it's,all subjective.
2074.17,[CHUCKLES] So how does
one,know whether or not
2077.8,"their recovery from workouts,"
their,"energy, their confidence,"
2081.94,their libido is within
a,healthy range?
2084.272,"I mean, obviously, for"
people,in a relationship
2086.23,they can know whether or
not,their libido matches
2088.3,the sort of cadence of the
relationship,and their partner.
2091.84,But how should people
think,about this
2094.607,and maybe then start
to,talk about it?
2096.19,Because one of the big
"differences,","I think,"
2098.023,between males and females
is,"that, because females"
2101.26,"have a monthly cycle, they are"
familiar,with the changes that
2105.55,occur in their hormones over
time,"because every 28 days,"
2108.353,those hormones are
changing,dramatically
2110.02,in ways that impact their
physiology,and psychology.
2112.39,"But for males, I"
feel,like there's
2113.807,a dearth of language to get
into,the more subtle aspects
2119.14,of this.
2119.68,It also has to do with
privacy,issues and people
2121.72,feeling like they don't
want,to overshare too much--
2125.193,not knowing what's
appropriate,to share.
2126.86,But when you talk to a
patient,"who's in their 30s,"
2129.4,or maybe even their
70s,or 60s-- it
2131.185,"doesn't matter-- a male patient,"
what,are you listening for?
2134.53,And I know you're
not,"a psychiatrist,"
2137.75,but what are your ears tuned to
in,order to try and figure out
2140.333,whether or not this
person,could really
2141.958,use some help with
hormone,optimization
2143.62,or whether or not
something,else--
2144.97,or maybe they're
just,doing great
2146.2,and they don't realize
it,because they're
2147.908,placing demands on themselves
that,are excessive?
2150.34,KYLE GILLETT: You want to use
a,lot of open-ended questions.
2153.26,This process is called
motivational,interviewing.
2156.07,And your goal is to
listen,to the patient
2159.19,and not plant an
idea,in their mind
2162.31,that they can follow
because,everybody is
2164.95,going to have a different goal.
2166.9,Some people are better at
reading,their biofeedback
2169.78,or telling how they
feel,on a daily basis.
2174.47,There is screening
questionnaires,designed--
2176.71,"for example, an"
ADAM,questionnaire
2178.48,to look at men's men's health
and,hormone-related health.
2182.24,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
called,ADAM questionnaire?
2184.24,KYLE GILLETT: ADAM
questionnaire.,
2184.91,ANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M?
2185.77,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
2186.13,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is
it,available online
2187.18,that people could
administer,it to themselves.
2188.95,Although we don't
want,people making
2190.03,clinical diagnoses of
themselves,"or anyone else,"
2192.07,is it that sort of exam?
2193.487,KYLE GILLETT: It is.
2194.32,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
2195.05,KYLE GILLETT: I don't believe it
is,a clinically-validated tool
2197.675,"like an ASCVD, which is like a"
risk,of heart attack and stroke
2200.95,tool or many other tools.
2203.763,"There's one for depression,"
there's,one for anxiety.
2205.93,They're called PHQ9
and,GAD7 respectively.
2209.63,"But anyway, there"
is,often an in--
2212.83,the ADAM questionnaire-- and
what,"you hear from the patient,"
2216.34,if you are a very careful
"listener,",is often different.
2220.218,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can
you,give me an example
2222.01,of some of the questions
on,this ADAM questionnaire
2224.135,or the sorts of motivational
interviewing,that you might do?
2226.87,So let's say I'm your patient.
2228.26,I sit down.
2228.945,What sorts of
questions,would you
2230.32,ask to probe these kinds
of,dimensions of hormones?
2233.47,KYLE GILLETT:
Questions,"about libido,"
2235.18,questions about
athletic,"performance,"
2237.31,questions about motivation.
2239.38,"And often, the patient"
will,"answer one thing,"
2242.05,but what you hear from them
subjectively,is far different.
2245.672,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
2246.88,Can you give me an
example,of a question?
2249.28,I'm happy to be the
guinea,pig here.
2251.65,KYLE GILLETT: A classic
one,"is, a guy comes in--"
2254.71,"and a lot of times,"
they,"say, oh, no,"
2256.96,the wife made me
go,to the doctor.
2258.91,"I go once a year, that's it."
2260.89,"I don't want anything, I"
don't,want any medications.
2263.59,Their screening
questionnaires,might be zeros
2266.5,"across the board, so nothing."
2267.85,No issues.
2268.66,They're apparently
in,perfect health.
2270.67,They talk to you for a
"while,","they get some rapport,"
2273.64,"they like you, and then right"
as,you're finishing up the visit
2276.67,and about to go
out,"the room, they"
2278.71,mention that their
libido,"isn't quite there,"
2281.89,and they're having a
little,"bit of ED as well,"
2283.99,and perhaps they're
even,having some chest
2285.76,pressure or tightness.
2286.902,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.
2287.86,So right as you're
leaving,"the room,"
2289.84,a patient will tell you that
they're,having some sexual side
2292.52,effects-- or not side effects.
2293.77,They're having some
sexual,"challenges,"
2295.36,and then they'll
mention,chest pressure.
2297.88,Is the chest pressure
a,general decoy
2300.22,"for, it's got to be"
my,"heart, or is it"
2302.955,related to the other things
that,they're reporting?
2305.08,KYLE GILLETT: It can be related.
2306.413,"In fact, erectile"
dysfunction,is known
2308.83,as the canary in the coal mine.
2311.09,So coal miners would take the
canary,"down, and it would--"
2313.838,the canary would die before
the,coal miners would
2315.88,"of, I believe, carbon"
monoxide,poisoning.
2318.37,"And often, one of"
the,causes of ED
2321.58,"is plaque buildup, which"
can,happen in the coronaries
2324.04,as well.
2324.76,"But sometimes, they notice"
the,symptom in the genitals
2328.21,before they do in
the,coronaries.
2329.81,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
for,"such a patient,"
2331.85,let's say that patient
was,a young person where
2334.48,plaque buildup in the
arteries,and veins
2336.79,is not all that likely
if,"they're, let's say,"
2338.98,in their 20s or
"30s,",what would be
2341.38,your next step of the interview
at,"that point, and what would"
2343.922,you consider?
2344.463,Would you immediately
order,labs for that person
2346.54,to try and rule out any
kind,of actual hormone level
2350.74,deficiency?
2351.49,KYLE GILLETT: I certainly
would,order labs.
2353.53,There are some individuals
that,"are very similar,"
2355.767,"and they come in, and they"
have,"the same symptoms,"
2357.85,and one individual might have
a,"very, very high testosterone,"
2361.27,and one individual might
be,severely hypogonadal.
2364.99,So there's a big difference
between,the subjective
2367.81,and what the labs look like.
2369.41,So I certainly order labs.
2371.2,You also ask them about if
it's,"situational or not,"
2375.58,you ask them if they
have,ED if they're--
2378.087,you ask them about their habits.
2379.42,You even ask about
"porn,","and masturbation,"
2382.03,and all these issues.
2382.955,"And of course, that's between"
the,doctor and the patient.
2385.33,And depending on
what,"they tell you,"
2387.1,you can often determine if there
is,a situational component--
2391.27,some people call
it,"psychogenic ED,"
2393.7,but I don't love the
term,"psychogenic ED,"
2396.1,because it kind of puts some
blame,on the patient's mind.
2401.06,"But a lot of the time,"
that,is the case.
2403.27,There is even a test.
2405.2,And this is very rarely
"ordered,",but it's called
2407.83,a nocturnal penile tumescence.
2409.99,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now,"
is,it true that there
2412.12,are periodic erections
during,sleep-- correct?
2415.39,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
2416.14,So you basically
put,a cuff to see
2418.96,if you were having a normal
sized,erection during sleep.
2422.92,And I believe about 90% of
the,"time they do that test,"
2426.52,they are indeed
having,erections.
2428.38,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Which,would point
2429.797,to this psychogenic
origin,of whatever
2432.533,challenges they're having in
terms,of sexual interactions.
2434.95,You mentioned porn
and,masturbation.
2437.6,This topic has come up a
bunch,of times on this podcast
2440.563,and on other
podcasts,I've gone on
2441.98,because of the relationship
between,dopamine sexual
2445.52,motivation and sexual behavior.
2447.87,And I've been of the
pretty,strong stance
2451.31,"that, while I'm not judging"
porn,"or masturbation,"
2454.76,it can create a brain
wiring,situation where
2458.42,males in particular
essentially,teach their brain
2461.9,to be aroused by watching other
people,have sex as opposed
2464.93,to being the first person
actor,in sexual interactions.
2469.47,"So in that sense, that's"
more,"about the brain wiring,"
2473.03,"and neuroplasticity,"
and,dopamine.
2474.68,But what are your thoughts
on,porn and masturbation
2477.17,as they relate to hormones?
2478.31,"I mean, this is a big"
debate,on the internet.
2480.21,"In fact, one of the"
most,common debates
2482.39,is whether or not masturbation
increases,or decreases
2485.72,testosterone in males.
2487.13,"Certainly, it will"
decrease,motivation
2489.98,to go find sexual partners.
2491.87,We know this.
2492.62,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
2493.37,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And there
are,more and more data on this
2495.745,all the time.
2496.46,In terms of the effects of
pornography,and masturbation--
2499.67,"and here, I suppose we need"
to,be somewhat specific
2502.277,and operationally define
what,we're talking about.
2504.36,We're talking about
porn,and masturbation
2506.69,"to the point of ejaculation,"
because,my understanding
2511.28,is that the ejaculation
and,orgasm associated with
2515.78,causes an increase in
"prolactin,",which blunts
2517.82,libido for some period of time.
2519.53,The duration of that will
vary,from person to person
2521.93,and circumstance
to,circumstance.
2523.49,"But basically, all of"
this,points to the fact
2525.83,that porn and
masturbation,can really
2528.66,limit libido in the real world.
2531.85,"And to me, pornography and the"
screen,is not the real world.
2535.742,Although screens exist
in,"the real world,"
2537.45,the real world doesn't
exist,in the screen.
2539.588,KYLE GILLETT: That's
an,"accurate statement,"
2541.38,and prolactin does have a
significant,acute increase
2546.84,after ejaculation.
2549.4,It does to some degree
after,"orgasm as well,"
2553.02,but prolactin acts
on,the pituitary
2555.72,to inhibit the release of
the,"hormones LH and FSH,"
2559.59,of which LH can
increase,testosterone.
2562.62,So this may be one
of,the cases where
2564.96,the dose makes the poison.
2566.4,And if it is a very
frequent,"habit,"
2568.11,certainly daily or
more,than once a day
2572.18,would be very detrimental from
a,hormonal component not even
2576.57,taking into account
the,neural wiring.
2578.913,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Listen,"
I,think it's terrific
2580.83,that you've actually
defined,"frequency,"
2582.36,because this is the problem
on,the internet or even
2584.31,in the doctor's office.
2585.42,You'll see descriptions
about,pornography
2587.94,being dangerous
for,certain things
2589.8,or detrimental to hormones.
2591.122,"People say frequent,"
but,what's frequent?
2592.83,So you're saying daily
or,multiple times per day
2595.05,would be potentially
detrimental,to the hormone
2598.2,profile of a male of
essentially,any age.
2600.63,KYLE GILLETT: And that's
just,for masturbation.
2603.75,With pornography--
with,"porn use as well,"
2608.01,it would likely be worse.
2609.845,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And,why is that?
2611.22,Just the sort of
dopaminergic,drive
2613.89,of the stimulus-- just the
really,intense visual stimulus?
2617.01,KYLE GILLETT:
Dopamine,sensitivity.
2618.99,I think that using the analogy
of,"a dopamine wave pool,"
2623.01,it would deepen the
"pool,",but not increase
2626.25,your supply of dopamine.
2627.6,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe you could
describe,the dopamine wave pool
2629.25,because I think it's such
a,powerful way of thinking
2631.44,about dopamine and
what,dopamine does.
2633.06,"In fact, I've always credited"
you,"when I've done it,"
2636.6,but I've generally stolen your
analogy,of the dopamine wave
2640.38,pool because it's so astute.
2643.11,KYLE GILLETT: The
dopamine,wave pool
2644.61,describes the natural
variation,of ups and downs
2647.94,in your dopamine
or,your motivation.
2650.19,"And in the wave pool, depending"
on,"how high the peak is,"
2655.92,you often have a deeper trough.
2660.12,So you do not want
to,high of a peak.
2662.31,"In addition, if your"
peak,"is very, very high--"
2665.49,"for example, when you're using"
many,substances like cocaine
2671.49,"or like amphetamines,"
your,dopamine
2673.11,can go so high that
you,lose almost all
2675.69,the water from the
wave,"pool, and then"
2677.4,"when you crash from that,"
not,"only is the trough low,"
2679.92,you have less dopamine in
the,pool to begin with.
2683.37,The dopamine
receptor,is extremely
2685.23,"sensitive, as is the"
Gaba,"receptor, which"
2687.48,"is an inhibitory receptor,"
whereas,dopamine is technically
2690.27,a stimulant more related to
adrenaline,and noradrenaline.
2693.96,The depth of the pool
can,change very quick.
2697.96,So you want to have that
happy,medium where you're
2700.11,"fairly near the top, but"
you're,not so near the top
2703.11,that the depth of the
pool,is going to go down.
2706.05,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I
interpret,that in the context
2709.43,"of this discussion about libido,"
"sex,","porn, and masturbation,"
2714.74,if somebody has a very intense
sexual,"experience-- and here,"
2719.03,we're not necessarily talking
about,an intense orgasm--
2721.97,we're talking about just a lot
of,"intense visual, so very--"
2726.02,"a lot of intense imagery,"
or,"auditory input, or both--"
2730.22,that is going to
lead,to a situation
2732.23,where dopamine is going
to,be depleted afterwards.
2735.2,A guest on this podcast before--
my,"colleague at Stanford, Dr."
2737.92,"Anna Lembke, who's an"
expert,"in addiction,"
2739.67,talked a bit about this--
the,sort of seesawing.
2741.61,"Like, here, we're talking"
about,a wave and a crashing
2743.54,out of the water
from,the wave pool.
2745.04,"There, it was a seesawing"
from,pleasure and pain.
2747.95,There's going to be a longer
and,deeper period of lack
2751.97,of pleasure following that.
2753.095,And I think a lot of people
"think,","oh, well, that's great."
2755.512,They want the
intense,experience.
2757.13,But if that intense experience
is,coming from pornography
2760.01,and masturbation-- or I suppose
coming,from high adrenaline
2763.4,"activities, like life-risking"
parkour,hanging off the side
2768.08,of a building-- it inevitably
is,going to lead to depressive
2771.65,"episodes, low libido"
episodes,that follow.
2773.81,Is that right?
2774.65,KYLE GILLETT: Correct-- in
a,similar physiologic way
2778.52,to withdrawal from
"stimulants,",like amphetamines.
2781.67,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, is sex"
with,a partner different?
2785.33,Because there are
many,people who
2787.28,are chasing more
and,more intense
2789.56,experiences with a partner as
opposed,to through pornography
2792.53,and masturbation.
2793.25,"Again, here, we're"
talking,about all ages.
2794.64,"And I should always say,"
anytime,we're talking about sex
2797.09,"with a partner, we're talking--"
2798.51,the four conditions that I
always,lay out on the Huberman
2802.64,Lab podcast are that we're
talking,"about consensual,"
2804.95,"age appropriate, context"
"appropriate,",species
2807.29,appropriate interactions.
2809.03,"KYLE GILLETT: Yeah,"
and,this is also
2811.28,a case where the dose
makes,the poison.
2813.93,"So if there's-- obviously,"
meeting,"all those criteria,"
2819.08,if they have one preference
"that,","for both of them,"
2824.48,"is a positive experience,"
then,that is likely OK.
2829.82,You're not going to be
able,to maintain dopamine
2832.46,over a certain threshold
for,"a long period of time,"
2835.8,so there very well
may,be a crash
2837.74,from that experience as well.
2839.24,And that crash may be different
in,one partner than the other.
2843.762,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
2844.97,So I'll draw an analogy to food.
2846.47,It would be like you don't have
to,serve the banquet meal seven
2849.57,"nights of the week,"
maybe,just two.
2851.42,Is that right?
2852.08,And there are other
delicious,foods out there?
2854.01,Can--
2854.51,KYLE GILLETT: Yes--
2854.74,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --we
use,that analogy?
2855.47,KYLE GILLETT: --that
is,very reasonable.
2856.94,I'm not trying to be PG-13.
2858.065,I'm just trying to parsimony
Occam's,razor the ability
2862.61,to describe a lot of
things,in a few words.
2866.27,I'd like to return to the key
things,that people should do--
2870.56,"or I should say, the key"
things,that men should
2872.56,do to optimize their hormones.
2873.81,So we talked about
getting,"some movement,"
2875.12,"getting some sunlight, getting"
quality,social connection one
2877.79,"way or the other, avoid"
excessively,frequent
2880.94,masturbation and
viewing,pornography.
2883.1,"And for some people, zero"
might,be the optimal number.
2887.327,And I keep coming back to this--
2888.66,KYLE GILLETT: For most people.
2889.08,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--for,most people.
2889.92,Interesting.
2890.7,I feel so fortunate
to,have grown
2892.26,up prior to the availability
of,internet pornography.
2894.75,I've never been a big
consumer,of pornography.
2896.76,It's just not been
my,"thing, but I"
2899.01,hear so often from males of
all,ages about their addiction
2902.58,"to it, their affliction by it."
2904.74,It's really a serious
"issue,",and that's
2906.652,one of the reasons why
I'm,grateful that you're
2908.61,willing to talk about this
and,your clinical experience
2910.902,with these patients.
2912.22,I'd like to take a quick
break,and acknowledge
2914.37,"one of our sponsors,"
Athletic,Greens.
2916.53,"Athletic Greens,"
now,"called AG1, is"
2919.32,a vitamin-mineral-probiotic
drink,
2921.39,that covers all of your
foundational,nutritional needs.
2924.21,I've been taking Athletic
Green,"since 2012,"
2926.97,so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
2929.25,The reason I started taking
Athletic,Greens and the reason
2931.667,I still take athletic Greens
once,or usually twice a day
2934.74,is that it gets
me,the probiotics
2936.84,that I need for gut health.
2938.49,Our gut is very important.
2939.63,It's populated by
gut,microbiota that
2942.14,"communicate with the brain, the"
immune,"system, and basically"
2944.64,all the biological
systems,of our body
2946.35,to strongly impact our
immediate,and long-term health.
2949.89,And those probiotics
in,Athletic Greens
2951.84,are optimal and vital
for,microbiotic health.
2955.593,"In addition, Athletic"
Greens,contains a number
2957.51,"of adaptogens,"
"vitamins,",and minerals
2959.13,that make sure that all of my
foundational,nutritional needs
2961.77,are met and it tastes great.
2964.398,If you'd like to
try,"Athletic Greens,"
2965.94,you can go to
"athleticgreens.com/huberman,",
2969.12,and they'll give you five
free,travel packs that make it
2971.67,really easy to mix up
Athletic,Greens while
2973.687,"you're on the road, in the"
"car,","on the plane, et cetera."
2976.02,And they'll give you a year
supply,"of vitamin D3, K2."
2979.62,"Again, that's"
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2982.2,to get the five free travel
packs,and the year supply
2984.78,"of vitamin D3, K2."
2986.61,"In terms of exercise,"
here's--,"again,"
2988.5,it's a double-edged sword.
2990.117,"On the one hand, it's"
great,"to get exercise,"
2991.95,but I'm familiar with--
2994.32,if I train an hour a day--
2996.69,10 minutes of
warm-up,in 50 minutes
2998.49,to an hour of weight
training,or 50 minutes
3000.5,to an hour of
"cardio,","I feel great,"
3002.36,"especially if, once a week,"
I,take a complete day off.
3004.61,That's sort of my
general,schedule.
3006.068,I'm also familiar
with,when I go out
3008.57,for runs that are excessively
long--,two hour runs or I spend
3012.11,90 minutes in the
gym,"to frequently,"
3014.03,I start to feel like garbage.
3015.71,Everything suffers.
3016.55,My sleep starts to suffer.
3017.65,It doesn't matter
how,much I eat--
3019.22,I don't seem to recover.
3020.48,I don't feel well.
3021.78,So I realize that
recovery,ability varies
3024.23,"between individuals,"
but,what do you
3026.03,"think is a healthy, sustainable"
exercise,regimen that anyone
3031.49,can follow that will also
support,their hormone status?
3035.57,KYLE GILLETT: For really
vigorous,"exercise,"
3037.88,around three to
four,times a week
3039.8,is very sustainable over
a,long period of time.
3042.92,"On top of that, you could add"
in,3 or four more instances
3047.03,of less vigorous exercise.
3048.837,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
for,"less vigorous,"
3050.42,would you mean zone two
cardio,where you can hold
3052.67,"a conversation, but"
beyond,which you can't?
3055.25,And for more vigorous
you're,thinking
3057.14,weight training or high
intensity,interval type
3059.93,training?
3060.737,Is that right?
3061.32,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
3062.237,You can also weight train
and,have some benefit even
3065.93,at a low to moderate intensity.
3068.21,If you think about
weight,training
3070.908,where you have-- and it's
not,necessarily related
3072.95,"to the incidence of DOMS,"
which,is Delayed Onset Muscle
3075.65,soreness.
3076.61,But if you weight
train,lazy or easy
3079.79,from time to time--
"obviously,",you
3081.29,want to weight train
very,heavy from time
3083.03,to time as well because of
more,lean body mass growth.
3086.85,But if you weight
train,"lighter, you're"
3089.87,going to be able to
do,"it more often,"
3092.15,and it can still help with
the,hypertrophy of collagen--
3097.31,"for example, in"
tendons,and ligaments.
3099.9,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,"here, again, I'd"
3101.48,like to perhaps drill into
this,notion of intensity
3104.647,and light weights because
for,"me, some of the most"
3106.73,brutal workouts
I've,ever done were
3108.68,in what I would consider
a,high repetition range--
3110.84,15 to 50.
3111.587,"Actually, I went up to Oregon"
to,watch the International Track
3114.17,and Field Championships.
3115.29,We went by to Cameron
Haynes's,place--
3119.45,the Cameron Haynes--
and,he and his trainer
3122.0,put us through a
workout,that was
3124.04,"25 to 50 repetitions per set,"
and,"it was done in circuit,"
3127.85,and it was brutal.
3128.73,So it was light--
3129.71,"I mean, those"
weights,were nothing.
3132.08,"In some cases, it"
was,body weight.
3133.65,But the number of
repetitions,was brutal.
3135.78,So when you say
limiting,"intensity,"
3137.84,are you talking about limiting
the,"number of sets to failure,"
3141.23,are you talking
about,really being
3143.63,kind of a lazy bear in the gym?
3145.49,I like to do that every
once--,"so a long rest,"
3147.74,that sort of thing.
3149.21,What are your thoughts
on,that as it relates
3151.31,to hormone optimization?
3152.54,So I'll just mention-- and
then,I'll let you answer--
3155.0,I feel best overall when I'm
training,for 10 minute warm-ups
3159.26,and about 45 or 50 minutes
of,"weight training,"
3161.69,where I'm pretty
lazy,between sets.
3163.46,Two to three minute
"rests,",training somewhere
3166.25,"in the 6 to 10 rep range,"
going,to failure every once
3169.383,"in a while, but mostly"
getting,that sort
3171.05,of last rep before what
I,would think is failure.
3173.092,"No forced reps,"
that,kind of thing.
3174.817,And then jogging on the
other,"days, nice and easy."
3176.9,"When I do that, I feel fantastic"
in,all other dimensions
3180.08,of life.
3181.46,When I train more
intensely,"than that,"
3183.74,"even with lightweight, so"
faster,"cadence and lower rest,"
3188.85,I feel like garbage.
3190.07,"I get a headache, I'm kind of"
"ornery,",everything suffers.
3194.21,So what are your thoughts on
defining,a optimal exercise
3198.62,strategy for hormones.
3199.577,I've never measured my
hormones,in those two
3201.41,"different contexts,"
but,I have to imagine
3203.118,that it's cortisol related.
3204.77,KYLE GILLETT: When they
study,"the effect of exercise,"
3207.59,"specifically vigorous exercise,"
one,area that's been studied
3211.52,is vigorous exercise-- episodes
lasting,longer than an hour.
3216.02,And they usually track it by a
rating,"of perceived exertion,"
3220.01,"which isn't perfect, and it's"
not,"extremely actionable,"
3222.74,but it's helpful for
clinical,science.
3224.51,But the takeaway from that
"is,","basically, do not--"
3228.11,it is not hormonally helpful
to,"train, especially regularly"
3233.73,"train, vigorously for"
longer,than an hour.
3237.82,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I'm happy
to,hear that because it sounds
3240.32,"like for most people,"
that,hour of work
3243.38,is really the threshold.
3244.815,I think this is important
for,"people to hear,"
3246.69,especially males
because,I think with all
3249.56,of the incredible examples
out,"there of people like Cam,"
3252.2,"like David Goggins,"
people,who are training
3254.63,for very long periods of time--
3256.7,and leaving aside all issues of
what,people are doing in order
3260.42,"to optimize the recovery, I"
think,an hour a day of exercise
3264.5,is just a great program
that,most anyone can follow.
3269.03,"And beyond an hour, you start"
running,into challenges.
3273.14,And the occasional 90-minute
or,two hour workout
3276.23,is no big deal.
3277.77,But if you start doing that
more,"than once every two months,"
3281.623,I think you're
headed,for trouble.
3283.04,Have you seen that in
people's,blood work
3285.08,and in their hormones?
3286.07,Do you ever see
people,that are just
3287.57,badly overtrained because
they're,just training
3289.528,too hard and too often?
3290.78,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
3291.86,When the blood work
is,"particularly bad,"
3295.22,they're often in a large
caloric,deficit as well.
3299.24,There's a synergistic effect
between,a caloric deficit.
3303.47,Even if you're maintaining
adequate,"protein intake,"
3305.99,you might not be maintaining
adequate,iron intake
3308.72,or adequate vitamin D. And
you're,also just literally
3312.38,in a caloric deficit.
3313.7,"Perhaps low carbs as well,"
very,low free testosterone.
3317.75,And they're simultaneously doing
a,lot of vigorous exercise.
3323.022,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
3324.23,"I often hear, and I'm starting"
to,"wonder whether or not,"
3327.14,some of the quicker-to-results
nutrition,tactics--
3333.78,things like dropping
all,"carbohydrates,"
3336.2,or the quicker-to-results
exercise,"habits,"
3339.89,like starting to do six
day,a week really intense
3342.05,workouts-- whether or
"not,","in the short run,"
3344.758,they work because they cause
the,cosmetic changes that people
3347.3,"are seeking, but that"
they,really undermine
3349.64,"the overall goal, which"
"is,","at least to me,"
3352.67,to have your hormones Maybe.
not,"optimized to 100%,"
3357.56,but to always be aiming
for,100% and be close to it
3360.62,at every stage of life.
3362.39,KYLE GILLETT:
Consistency,is key here.
3364.4,If you are not
"consistent,",then the law
3367.46,of diminishing returns
certainly,applies.
3369.69,So 80% or 90% of the benefit
over,"many, many months"
3375.59,"is far better than 100%,"
but,only half the time.
3380.373,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
3381.29,One thing that I found
to,be tremendously useful
3383.51,is to finish the workout while
I,"still have energy, to not take"
3387.59,myself to exhaustion.
3388.94,And then I'm able to talk
about,the dopamine wave pool.
3391.61,I'm able to sort of
ride,that into the rest
3393.71,of the day feeling great.
3394.85,I sort of save or bank some
of,the vigor from the training
3399.14,to bring it into my work.
3400.38,"But then again,"
I'm,not an athlete.
3401.838,I get paid to think and to
"speak,",not to lift weights
3404.93,or to run.
3405.495,KYLE GILLETT: Another
component,of that
3407.12,is the balance between
your,"sympathetic,"
3409.46,which is your fight or
flight,"nervous system,"
3411.35,"and your parasympathetic,"
which,is your rest or digest
3413.93,nervous system.
3415.31,"There is an anecdote,"
which,"is likely true,"
3417.95,that many elite
bodybuilders,are very
3420.53,parasympathetic besides while
they're,lifting weights.
3423.177,ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
mean,they're lazy
3424.76,and they like to eat a lot.
3425.84,KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
3426.17,ANDREW HUBERMAN: The lazy bear
in,the gym kind of phenomenon.
3428.712,KYLE GILLETT: Absolutely.
3429.98,"But that being said, after a"
"very,",very vigorous workout--
3433.798,"for example, one where"
you're,"trained to failure,"
3435.84,which bodybuilders and power
lifters,do all the time--
3438.78,you feel the tiredness--
or,you feel the strain
3444.02,from that heavy
sympathetic,activity
3447.05,when you are lifting
a,"heavy weight,"
3448.88,and it can
potentially,affect how
3451.61,you feel the rest of the day.
3452.88,So many people who have a job
where,that is highly cognitive
3457.49,do not like to have an
extremely,vigorous workout
3459.755,"in the morning, which"
is,when a lot of people
3461.63,are able to exercise.
3462.893,ANDREW HUBERMAN: When I exercise
early,"in the morning-- that is,"
3465.56,before 9:00 AM--
3466.46,I have more energy all day long.
3468.02,"If I do it mid-morning,"
I,have experienced
3469.82,more of an afternoon crash.
3471.05,There's probably some
circadian,biology in there.
3473.76,I also noticed-- and I've
actually,seen in my bloodwork--
3476.81,that if I don't get
out,for a 45-minute jog
3480.11,"at least once a week,"
all,of my blood profiles
3483.47,suffer in a direction that
I,don't want them to go.
3485.86,"In particular, testosterone"
and,estrogen move in directions
3488.62,that are not
conducive,to my goals.
3492.55,I'd like to talk about
some,of the approaches
3495.07,that people can use in
order,to optimize hormones.
3497.44,"And these days, for"
better,or for worse--
3500.26,I think for worse--
3502.09,younger guys are
asking,about and using
3506.56,testosterone replacement
therapy--,so-called TRT.
3509.22,And I just want to
frame,this up by saying
3510.97,there is no strict
cutoff,for what is TRT.
3513.31,There are plenty of people whose
blood,levels of testosterone
3516.95,and estrogen are within
the,normal reference range
3519.34,and decide to start
doing,these things.
3521.02,"Of course, they can"
limit,fertility.
3522.56,There are a bunch of
issues,"even at non, quote,"
3525.04,"unquote, steroidal"
performance,enhancing dosages.
3529.18,I'd love to frame this up
by,"first defining our terms,"
3531.49,because one of the
challenges,on the internet
3533.477,is people talk about
"TRT,",then they'll
3535.06,talk about performance
enhancing,"drugs,"
3536.44,they'll talk about steroids.
3537.607,They're all steroids.
3539.26,"I mean, testosterone, estrogen"
are,both steroid hormones.
3542.44,But what one considers
replacement,therapy
3545.74,versus what one considers
performance,enhancing
3548.74,is going to depend.
3550.21,So here's my question.
3553.31,Why in the world--
3554.86,[EMPHASIS] why in the world--
3557.2,would any male in his teens
or,"twenties, or even 30s,"
3563.47,whose blood levels of
testosterone,and estrogen
3566.447,are at the appropriate
"levels,",meaning
3568.03,within the normal
reference,"range,"
3570.97,take exogenous testosterone
given,all the negative effects
3575.47,"on fertility, some of"
the,challenges that it
3578.17,can present if the dosages
aren't,"quite right, et cetera."
3580.75,Why would they do
"that,",certainly
3583.0,if they are not being paid
for,"a particular endeavor,"
3587.03,like they're not making money?
3588.28,If they are playing
a,"sport, chances"
3589.51,are they're not allowed
to,do that anyway.
3591.26,It's on the banned
substances,list.
3593.11,"So to me, it just seems"
like,a crazy idea.
3597.04,"But then again,"
I'm,of a generation
3598.54,that really hasn't thought about
doing,that stuff until people
3601.36,were in their 40s and
50s,or even never.
3604.69,So is there ever a case for
somebody,in their 20s or 30s
3608.47,to take testosterone if
their,blood levels are
3611.77,within the 300 to 900 nanograms
per,deciliter reference range?
3616.63,KYLE GILLETT: Not many cases.
3618.25,The reason for any performance
enhancing,"drug, whether or not"
3621.79,"it is a steroid, synthetic,"
"bioidentical,","or otherwise,"
3626.98,varies a lot.
3627.85,Some individuals do it
only,for cosmetic reasons
3631.99,even if it can have
deleterious,effects
3635.59,on the cosmetic
"appearance,","for example,"
3638.65,of your skin in the long run.
3640.66,But everyone has their
different,reasons.
3644.77,As far as like when
does,the benefit
3647.74,"outweigh the detriment, not"
very,often if you're in your 20s
3652.12,and certainly--
3653.35,probably-- almost hardly never.
3655.0,"There's always rare cases, like"
Coleman,"syndrome and whatnot,"
3658.66,but almost never if
you're,very young.
3662.437,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people
in,"their 20s, 30s, and beyond--"
3665.02,"40s, et cetera-- whose"
testosterone,and estrogen
3668.68,levels are at the
appropriate,"ratios,"
3670.6,and then within the
normal,"reference range,"
3673.33,and they feel pretty good--
3674.8,[CHUCKLES] we talked about
the,ADAMs exam-- or this sort
3677.133,of like feel-pretty-good is code
for,"libido, energy, recovery,"
3680.62,"et cetera, and are"
feeling,at least
3683.92,workable for their lifestyle.
3686.59,"For those people,"
what,can they do
3689.71,"besides get great sleep, train,"
but,"not too hard or too often,"
3693.28,"et cetera, et cetera?"
3694.18,What are some of the things in
the,realm of supplementation
3696.67,that can help them optimize
their,testosterone and estrogen
3700.54,without suppressing their
own,endogenous production
3704.41,of testosterone and estrogen?
3706.6,KYLE GILLETT: Let's mention
creatine,is the first one.
3709.09,Creatine is
interesting,because it
3710.678,has multiple different effects.
3711.97,It helps with amino
acid,synthesis.
3714.22,It also helps with
oxidative,stress.
3716.87,It can also serve
as,the backup fuel
3718.81,"tank for your mitochondria,"
so,holding backup ATP.
3722.38,And it does slightly
increase,"total testosterone,"
3725.74,and it also increases the
conversion,of testosterone
3728.44,"to dihydrotestosterone,"
so,potentially it's
3731.17,especially useful in men
in,even their teenage years
3736.18,and their 20s.
3736.788,ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned
the,conversion of testosterone
3739.33,"to dihydrotestosterone, and"
there,is mythology out there
3742.51,that creatine can
increase,"hair loss,"
3744.19,I'm guessing because there's
at,least one study showing
3746.59,that creatine can increase DHT--
3748.84,dihydrotestosterone.
3749.83,And DHT is one of the
primary,hormones that can
3753.46,promote male pattern baldness.
3755.62,"So the question therefore is,"
does,creatine supplementation
3761.2,increase the rate of hair loss?
3764.03,"KYLE GILLETT: Theoretically,"
it,"can, but in each individual,"
3770.92,preventing hair loss
is,a very poor reason
3773.53,"to take creatine,"
because,it's not
3775.0,going to take you to a
supraphysiologic,"level,"
3778.36,it's not going to
increase,your androgens
3783.07,to a unnormal level of binding.
3786.67,So I feel like this--
3788.98,if that was a reason to not
take,"creatine for hair loss,"
3792.43,then that's--
3793.18,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You,mean-- sorry--
3794.638,hair loss is not a reason
to,avoid taking creatine?
3797.29,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
3798.207,Hair loss is not a reason
to,avoid taking creatine.
3801.52,Think of it as just
bringing,you to what you
3804.76,are naturally inclined to have.
3807.61,If your conversion of
testosterone,to DHT
3810.19,"is already high, then often,"
creatine,does not affect this.
3814.48,It just kind of
resets,your balance
3816.64,between testosterone being
aromatized,to estrogen
3819.79,or being 5-alpha reduced DHT.
3822.88,So it's not going to speed
up,hair loss more than just
3826.12,naturally being a male does.
3827.89,"So in some individuals,"
it,will have no effect.
3830.62,In some individuals--
for,"whatever reason,"
3832.84,they have almost no 5-alpha
reductase,activity--
3835.57,it will return them
to,natural or normal.
3837.732,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.
3838.69,"Well, I take 5 grams a day"
of,creatine monohydrate.
3841.51,I do it for the
tissue,volumizing
3844.54,"effects, so for"
exercise,"benefits,"
3846.46,but also for the
cognitive,effects.
3848.11,I don't know if it's
increasing,my hair loss.
3850.03,"I mean, I've got a little bit"
of,widow's peak type hair loss.
3853.42,That's where it is for me.
3855.73,I suppose beard growth is
associated,with DHT too.
3858.85,Is that right?
3859.72,KYLE GILLETT: Yes
3860.05,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
What,I learned--
3860.71,but then again I haven't
been,into those literature
3862.835,in a long time-- is that because
of,"differences in receptors,"
3865.78,that DHT causes hair
growth,on the face and hair
3868.81,loss on the head.
3869.71,Is that right?
3870.52,"KYLE GILLETT: Yes,"
and,"the amount,"
3872.08,"and the sensitivity, and"
density,of those receptors
3875.11,is genetically determined.
3877.14,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And is it true
that,if your mother's father
3879.64,was bald that you will be
bald,"in the same pattern,"
3882.59,"and if he wasn't, you won't?"
3885.28,KYLE GILLETT: That is
a,decent correlation.
3887.62,Part of the proposed
mechanism,"of this-- well,"
3889.675,"there are several genes,"
and,you can actually
3891.55,test your genes for hair loss.
3893.63,You do get a decent amount
of,them from your mother.
3896.26,The unique thing you
get,from your mother
3898.27,that she may have
gotten,from her father--
3900.41,that she got one of the
copies,from her father--
3902.41,is your X chromosome.
3903.76,And the androgen receptor
gene,"is on your X chromosome,"
3907.64,so all men got their
androgen,receptor
3910.81,gene from their mother.
3912.337,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
on,"their X chromosome,"
3914.17,not on the Y chromosome.
3915.263,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
3916.18,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
3917.388,Even though all of
"the,","quote, unquote,"
3919.27,male promoting genes are on
the,"Y chromosome, like malaria,"
3924.13,"and inhibiting, et cetera."
3925.48,Interesting.
3926.77,So 5 grams a day of creatine
for,most people should be fine.
3930.7,Beneficial for tissue
volumizing--,"so strength,"
3933.49,bringing water
into,the muscles--
3935.08,and for the cognitive effects.
3937.9,And the clinical support
for,"creatine, I think,"
3940.03,is quite strong at the
5,gram per day dosage.
3942.97,What other sorts of supplements
can,people benefit from?
3946.13,We already talked
about,the omegas
3947.56,and making sure that people are
getting,enough prebiotic fiber
3950.5,to support the gut
microbiome,and vitamin D.
3954.01,So what other supplement-based
tools,can people consider?
3957.79,KYLE GILLETT: Another one
we,can loop in with creatine
3960.04,is betaine.
3961.03,Some people are
nonresponders,"to creatine,"
3963.46,so you can increase
that,"to 10 grams,"
3965.89,or you can use
its,cousin betaine
3967.96,to help with amino
acid,synthesis
3970.03,and shunting of energy.
3972.4,"Along with that, I would put"
l-carnitine,which is actually
3976.93,the smallest peptide hormone.
3978.31,It's just two amino acids that
are,"put together, so it's a--"
3981.31,ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a hormone?
3983.08,Interesting.
3983.862,I'm not challenging it.
3984.82,"KYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide."
3985.12,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just--
3985.9,I'm not challenging it.
3986.56,KYLE GILLETT: I would call it
a,peptide more than a hormone.
3989.27,So I would not call
l-carnitine,"a hormone,"
3991.81,but I would call
dopamine,a hormone.
3993.85,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I"
could--,a neurohormone.
3996.06,It's so hard to define things
as,transmitters or hormones
3999.13,at some level.
3999.91,I agree.
4000.72,"So l-carnitine-- actually,"
I,should backtrack.
4003.57,Betaine-- do you recall
what,dosage people typically
4008.49,would take if they're a
creatine,non-responder?
4011.43,KYLE GILLETT: 1 to 3 grams.
4012.555,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Per day?
4012.87,KYLE GILLETT: In fact--
4013.828,yeah-- several
versions,of creatine
4015.33,have betaine mixed in because
it,helps with the processing
4019.08,of methionine and homocysteine.
4020.713,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if somebody
is,already taking creatine
4023.13,and likes it and
responds,to it--
4024.72,I'll raise my hand--
such,"as myself,"
4026.49,would adding betaine help or
is,it redundant with creatine?
4030.853,KYLE GILLETT: Only
if,their homocysteine
4032.52,is persistently elevated.
4033.78,And homocysteine is kind of
like,an inflammatory marker that
4036.42,can build up if you're not
converting,enough of it
4038.85,down stream.
4039.66,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
How,would I know?
4041.18,KYLE GILLETT: Just a
blood,test or if you
4043.56,knew your MTHFR
"polymorphism,",which
4046.14,is basically how you
add,methyl groups
4049.71,to many things in the body.
4051.632,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
4052.59,Any side effects of betaine
that,people should be aware of?
4056.28,KYLE GILLETT: Not
that,I know of.
4057.66,ANDREW HUBERMAN: People can
look,it up on-- examine.com
4059.73,is a great site for that.
4060.772,They'll surely list it.
4061.74,They just revamped
their,"site by the way,"
4063.448,"and it was awesome before,"
and,it's platinum now.
4068.28,So l-carnitine-- what are
the,ways to take l-carnitine?
4071.82,I know that there is
oral,forms in capsules
4074.07,and there's injectables.
4075.16,"The injectables, I think"
you,need a prescription.
4077.25,Is that right?
4078.0,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
4078.51,You need a prescription
for,"the injectables,"
4080.28,or you should really
get,a prescription
4081.905,for the injectables.
4083.61,For when you inject it--
4086.19,"of course, at the"
supervision,of your doctor--
4088.17,it's usually done
intramuscularly.,
4090.06,It's an aqueous
"solution,",so it does not
4092.49,have an oil or a
carrier,oil in it
4094.38,like TR-- like
testosterone,esters do.
4097.75,"However, if you inject"
it,"too superficially,"
4100.682,it's not going to make
or,break anything.
4102.39,"Often, it just burns if you"
inject,it subcutaneously
4105.42,and it does not disseminate
throughout,the body as well.
4109.38,L-carnitine potentially
has,localized effects
4112.92,if you inject it.
4114.359,"If you ingest it orally,"
then,it has a very low
4118.05,bioavailability--
maybe,only 10%.
4119.793,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,"
I,think most people are
4121.71,going to be able to
get,l-carnitine only--
4123.63,or in its capsule form.
4126.22,So what are the
dosages,of l-carnitine
4127.979,that one needs to
ingest,then if they
4130.2,want to get a benefit because
if,"only 10% is being absorbed,"
4134.88,it's probably a
lot,of l-carnitine.
4136.485,How much should
people,take per day?
4138.0,KYLE GILLETT:
"Usually,",I recommend
4139.5,for oral l-carnitine
between,"1,000 milligrams"
4142.89,"and up to 4,000 or"
"5,000",milligrams.
4145.68,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 1 to
4--,maybe even 5 grams.
4148.543,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
4149.46,Up to 5 grams a day.
4150.96,If you're on that
"much,",especially
4153.06,if you have a dysregulated
gut,"microbiome,"
4155.85,you should be
concerned,with TMAO
4157.859,which is a potential
carcinogen,that both carnitine
4160.83,and choline can convert into.
4163.08,And your gut
microbiota,determine
4165.54,how much that happens.
4166.763,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Is,it true that I
4168.18,can offset any negative
effects,of alpha GPC--
4171.63,choline that is-- and
l-carnitine,that I
4174.75,take by ingesting garlic?
4176.67,Is that right?
4177.33,KYLE GILLETT: There's a compound
in,garlic called allicin--
4179.88,I believe it's
A-L-L-I-C-I-N.,It's also part
4182.79,of the scientific name-- the
genus,of types of garlic.
4186.899,And this can help decrease
the,conversion to TMAO.
4189.99,Berberine actually slightly
decreases,the conversion
4192.39,to TMAO as well probably
through,alteration
4195.42,of the gut microbiome.
4196.68,And then just optimizing
your,gut microbiome
4199.37,can decrease conversion.
4200.37,So not everyone needs
"allicin,",but it's something
4203.003,that you should
certainly,consider
4204.42,if you were on a high dose.
4206.377,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
going,to continue
4207.96,to take the 600 milligrams
of,garlic every time
4210.93,"I take my l-carnitine,"
but,I'm going
4212.58,to skip the berberine
because,berberine gives me
4214.32,brutal headaches and it makes me
crave,carbohydrates because it
4216.945,drops my blood sugar.
4217.862,KYLE GILLETT: It has many other
"effects,",including the dawn
4220.32,phenomenon where
it,drops your blood
4221.82,sugar when you're sleeping
and,you can't even realize it.
4224.205,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I am
not,"a fan of berberine,"
4226.08,and I'm sorry for
those,of you that are.
4228.3,I'm not trying to offend
"anyone,","although frankly,"
4230.86,if you're being offended
by,"my stance on berberine,"
4233.67,then maybe we should
have,another discussion.
4235.65,In any case injectable
"l-carnitine,",
4238.26,if one can get that through a
"doctor,",how much is absorbed
4241.5,and how much should one take?
4243.35,KYLE GILLETT: Almost
all,of it's absorbed.
4245.1,In general you're taking
between,500 milligrams up to--
4249.3,you can take a pretty high
dose,"up to 2,000 milligrams."
4252.6,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what
we,did not talk about
4254.67,is what l-carnitine does?
4256.56,So why should why should
someone,go through all of this?
4259.05,Is it to optimize
"testosterone,",is it
4261.66,working on the receptor side?
4263.3,What's l-carnitine doing?
4265.162,KYLE GILLETT: It's a shuttle.
4266.37,So I think it's named
carnitine,palmitoyl coenzyme
4270.27,"A. Basically, it"
just,takes nutrients
4273.45,from outside your
mitochondria,and puts them in.
4276.34,It also has a unique effect--
4278.1,"well, not too unique"
because,tadalafil actually
4280.23,has this effect as well--
4281.49,is that it increases the
density,of the androgen receptor
4285.18,and the cytoplasm of your cells.
4287.98,So even if your androgen
receptor,sensitivity
4290.46,doesn't change and even if your
testosterone,"does not change,"
4294.0,you will have more testosterone
binding,to that increased
4296.94,number of receptors.
4297.865,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Does
one,need to cycle
4299.49,"l-carnitine, creatine, betaine?"
4301.87,KYLE GILLETT: No reason
to,cycle any of those.
4305.105,ANDREW HUBERMAN: What
other,supplements
4306.73,can one use to try and
improve,hormone profiles?
4310.69,"And here, I realize we're"
using,a very broad brush
4312.925,because when we say
improve,"hormone profiles,"
4314.8,what are we really
talking,about?
4316.22,"And for me, at least, I think"
about,the subjective stuff.
4321.79,Do people feel
like,they are going
4323.65,to have more energy as
a,consequence of doing
4325.57,"these things, are they going to"
have,"the more optimized libido,"
4329.14,or are they going to have
more,optimized recovery
4331.87,from exercise?
4332.77,"Because, I mean,"
it's,not clear to me
4334.51,that taking one's
testosterone,from 600 to 800
4337.12,is always going to be a good
"thing,",especially if estrogen
4339.7,is increasing in parallel.
4341.02,That could cause issues.
4342.377,It could certainly
make,things better.
4343.96,It could certainly
make,things worse.
4346.12,"So with that backdrop, what"
are,some of the other things
4350.703,people can take?
4351.37,And then we'll go
back,to this issue
4352.87,of what really is optimization.
4354.34,KYLE GILLETT: Let's
briefly,"mention vitamin D,"
4356.257,which is also a hormone.
4357.44,It's actually a sterile hormone.
4359.14,And if you have deficient
vitamin,"D and you replace it,"
4362.98,then you will optimize
your,testosterone.
4365.98,Let's also mention boron.
4367.24,So if you have a
very,"high SHBG, boron"
4369.55,can acutely help lower
it,usually in a dose
4372.04,of 5 to 12 milligrams per day.
4374.57,It's not really a
sustained,"effect,"
4376.45,but boron is depleted in
soils,in many countries.
4380.26,I believe it's very high in
soils,in Greece and Turkey.
4383.08,So eating dates or raisins
that,are from those areas
4385.66,potentially have more boron.
4387.31,Boron also might be
one,of the reasons
4389.77,why the reference
range,for testosterone
4392.53,is much higher in those
countries,than other countries.
4395.688,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
just,"to remind people,"
4397.48,that SHBG sex hormone
binding,globulin
4399.82,is attaching to the
testosterone,molecule
4402.01,and limiting the amount of
so-called,free testosterone
4404.35,that's available to have
its,impact on cells.
4406.54,When Dr. Peter Attia
was,on this podcast--
4408.958,"in fact, sitting in"
that,very chair--
4410.5,he said that the ideal level
of,free testosterone in males
4414.31,should be about 2% of
one's,total testosterone.
4417.775,Would you agree with
that,number or disagree?
4419.65,I'm sure Peter would be
fine,if you said either.
4422.065,[CHUCKLES]
4422.802,KYLE GILLETT: 2% is
a,good rule of thumb.
4424.51,"Usually, the reference range"
is,between about 1% and 4%.
4428.26,Some people do have
genetic,polymorphisms
4431.29,"in SHBG, a specific"
gene,mutation where
4434.92,they have very low SHBGs.
4437.29,Also men that have varicose
veins,"in their testes,"
4440.32,"also known as varicoceles,"
tend,"to have very high SHBGs,"
4444.49,so that percentage would
likely,be less than 2%.
4447.8,So just because your
percentage,of free T to total T
4452.74,is a little bit above
or,"below 2%, that's OK."
4457.25,We just need to figure
out,the reason why it is.
4459.61,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
How,would somebody
4461.068,know if they have varicose
veins,"in their testicles,"
4463.72,especially if their
testicles,are still in--
4466.42,attached to their body?
4467.86,"KYLE GILLETT: Sometimes,"
it's,hard to tell.
4469.99,There are several grades.
4471.49,If you have a grade 3
or,"a grade 4 varicocele,"
4475.49,it has what's called a
bag,of worms appearance.
4477.85,So think about if you've
just,"resistance trained,"
4480.37,or it's a really
hot,"day, or you're"
4482.38,wearing very tight
fitting,"clothing,"
4484.6,then if you feel it and
almost,feels like there's
4486.91,worms in the scrotum.
4489.44,The other way is to do--
4490.54,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's,a scary visual.
4492.165,KYLE GILLETT:
"--yeah,",bag of worms.
4493.9,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it"
was,"just that-- yeah, anyway."
4495.52,I think parasites
when,"I hear that,"
4497.11,but that's not what
you're,referring to.
4498.777,You're talking about
just,the texture.
4501.195,KYLE GILLETT: The best way
for,most people to check
4503.32,is to valsalva for a
long,period of time.
4506.95,"When you valsalva, venous"
return,will decrease.
4510.562,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can you
explain,valsalva for people?
4512.77,KYLE GILLETT: It's bearing down
like,you're lifting a weight
4515.27,"or having a bowel movement,"
where,you swallow.
4518.92,"And a lot of times,"
you,can almost
4520.78,see build up of blood in
you're,jugular veins as well.
4526.46,So you have decreased
blood,return
4529.69,to the heart and increased
blood,in the veins themselves.
4534.692,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to,take a brief break
4536.65,and thank our sponsor
InsideTracker.,
4539.56,InsideTracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
4542.2,that analyzes data
from,your blood and DNA
4544.66,to help you better
understand,your body
4546.37,and help you reach
your,health goals.
4548.17,I've long been a believer in
getting,regular bloodwork done
4550.78,for the simple reason that
many,of the factors that impact
4553.762,your immediate and
long-term,health
4555.22,can only be analyzed from
a,quality blood test.
4557.765,The problem with a
lot,of blood and DNA
4559.39,"tests out there, however,"
is,that you get data
4561.58,"back about metabolic factors,"
"lipids,","and hormones,"
4564.12,"and so forth, but you don't"
know,what to do with those data.
4566.62,InsideTracker
solves,that problem
4568.6,and makes it very easy
for,you to understand
4570.76,"what sorts of nutritional,"
"behavioral,",maybe even
4574.39,supplementation-based
interventions,
4576.67,you might want to
take,on in order
4578.35,to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic,"factors, hormones,"
4581.02,"lipids, and other"
things,that impact
4582.73,your immediate and
long-term,health to bring
4584.8,those numbers into the
ranges,that are appropriate
4587.26,and indeed optimal for you.

4595.63,That's
insidetracker.com/huberman,
4598.21,to get 20% off.
4599.92,So vitamin D3--
4600.877,I'm guessing you're
talking,about vitamin D3
4602.71,specifically when
you,say vitamin D--
4605.2,"and then boron, 5 to"
12,milligrams per day.
4608.97,And then what are some
of,the other things
4610.72,to optimize testosterone
that,are in supplement form?
4614.657,KYLE GILLETT: We can talk
about,things that affect
4616.74,the steroidogenesis cascade.
4618.43,So we could touch
on,tongkat ali.
4619.843,I know we've talked about
that,a little bit before--
4622.01,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I'm
guessing,a number of people
4623.13,probably haven't heard
that,conversation.
4625.14,KYLE GILLETT: Also
known,as Long Jack.
4626.79,And that upregulates
several,different enzymes
4629.94,in the steroidogenesis cascade.
4631.92,"And by that, what you mean if--"
and,this is another good thing
4635.65,to Google--
4636.15,I think anybody interested
in,hormone optimization
4638.34,should understand where
sterile,hormones come from.
4642.24,They come usually
from,cholesterol
4644.31,and they can be shunted off
to,"vitamin D very easily,"
4647.32,they can be shunted
off,"to testosterone,"
4649.59,"or estrogens, or progestins"
quite,easily as well.
4653.52,But tongkat helps
with,the conversion
4656.19,of multiple key steps where
you,synthesize testosterone.
4661.68,Another-- think of it as like
a,coenzyme or a cofactor--
4666.06,an upregulator of these
steps,is insulin and IGF-1.
4670.68,So a good rule of thumb is if
you,are not expecting as much
4674.79,"growth hormone,"
"insulin,",and IGF-1--
4677.01,"for example, lower carb"
"diets,","caloric deficits,"
4680.79,you're trying to cut
body,fat or body weight--
4683.58,then tongkat is going to
be,theoretically especially
4687.72,powerful.
4688.948,ANDREW HUBERMAN: What
sorts,of dosages of tongkat
4690.99,do you recommend
to,your patients?
4693.12,KYLE GILLETT: Anywhere from
300,"to 1,200 milligrams a day."
4697.2,"With tongkat, you need"
to,be careful with
4699.99,the standardization because--
4702.48,and if you're thinking about
a,"general tongkat supplement,"
4705.03,which is by far the
most,well-studied--
4707.52,then you're looking at the
eurycomanone,"content, which"
4712.41,is a plant compound
that,is likely
4714.87,the main active
pharmacologic,effect.
4718.3,So that's the compound that's
having,the effect on the body.
4721.48,And if you standardize the
eurycomanone,"very, very high,"
4725.76,then theoretically you're having
more,effect at a lower dose.
4729.577,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
take,400 milligrams
4731.16,of tongkat ali per day.
4732.828,I take it early in
the,day because it
4734.37,"has a bit of a stimulant effect,"
and,"if I take it after 2:00 PM,"
4737.31,it starts to inhibit my sleep.
4739.56,I've been taking it for years.
4741.69,And I rather like
that,the effects.
4745.2,It seems subtle but consistent.
4747.51,I've never cycled it.
4749.4,Do you recommend cycling it?
4751.32,KYLE GILLETT: I don't see
any,reason to cycle it.
4753.39,There is a reason to
cycle,"some supplements,"
4757.5,but no reason to cycle tongkat.
4759.205,ANDREW HUBERMAN: My
blood,work tells me
4760.83,that it causes an increase
in,free testosterone for me
4763.89,and also a slight increase in
luteinizing,hormone for me.
4767.94,What are some of the other
effects,on various hormones
4770.34,that you've observed in the
bloodwork,of your patients
4772.77,taking tongkat ali?
4774.92,KYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can
also,slightly increase DHEA.
4778.19,And if you have a
very,high SHBG--
4781.22,"again, that's the protein"
that,binds up your androgens
4783.92,and estrogens-- an extremely
important,protein--
4787.55,"the higher your SHBG, the"
more,it helps decrease it.
4791.25,So they've studied
tongkat,in populations
4794.72,with very normal SHBGs and
it,does nothing for SHBG.
4798.402,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
4799.61,Does that mean it does
nothing,for somebody overall?
4802.26,So if somebody has an SHBG
that's,"in the normal range,"
4805.1,will taking tongkat benefit
them,in any other way?
4808.16,"KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll"
increase,their total and free
4811.07,testosterone.
4812.12,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
4813.948,Does it-- is it known to
have,effects on anything
4815.99,else like thyroid
"hormone,","growth hormone,"
4818.03,or is it purely in these
steroid,synthesis pathways?
4821.12,Or steroid-- I should say
"synthesis,","and receptor,"
4824.24,and modulation pathways.
4825.68,KYLE GILLETT: There's no direct
effect,on those pathways.
4828.26,"However, any time you alter your"
free,"androgen or free estrogen,"
4834.56,particularly one without
altering,"the other,"
4837.63,it will alter the
binding,protein
4839.27,that binds thyroid hormones.
4841.05,So any change you
"make,",whether it's
4843.17,natural optimization
or,"hormone replacement,"
4845.81,you're going to slightly skew
your,thyroid hormone profile.
4849.17,One common actionable example
of,this that I see often
4852.62,clinically is someone
"starts,","let's say,"
4856.67,estrogen replacement or
testosterone,replacement--
4859.34,maybe they're taking an
AI,with their testosterone
4861.56,replacement--
4862.28,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Aromatase,inhibitor?
4863.822,"KYLE GILLETT: Correct,"
an,"aromatase inhibitor,"
4865.738,which blocks the
conversion,to estrogen.
4867.74,If they're taking
testosterone,and they have
4870.68,very little
"estrogen,",then you're
4872.87,going to decrease the
binding,"protein, also known"
4875.78,"as thyroxine binding globulin,"
which,binds active thyroid
4879.53,hormones.
4880.56,So if you start
TRT,and you either
4884.69,have low aromatase activity
or,no aromatase activity--
4888.53,no conversion to estrogen--
then,your free thyroid hormones
4891.8,will go up.
4893.3,"Even just acutely, usually"
feedback,"inhibition,"
4896.82,which is how the body
talks,"to itself and says,"
4899.87,we need to make more of
this,or less of this.
4902.3,"But acutely, there's"
not,always enough time.
4906.08,You're going to have very
high,thyroid hormones
4909.26,"and you can have tachycardia,"
which,is a fast heart rate
4912.65,or you can feel kind
of,like overly fight
4914.72,or flight due to
increased,thyroid hormone
4917.39,activity in the in tissue.
4919.52,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
4920.87,So tongkat ali--
just,a broad range--
4923.12,"300 to 1,200 milligrams per day."
4925.16,And I realize that the
source,matters there.
4928.16,What are some of
the,other hormones
4930.32,that you prescribe to
your,patients who do not
4933.8,want to go on testosterone
replacement,therapy
4936.14,or take exogenous DHEA
or,anything like that?
4940.28,KYLE GILLETT: We can
talk,about fadogia next.
4942.41,Fadogia is interesting because--
it's,a genus of plants.
4945.11,Fadogia agrestis is one of them.
4947.06,There's many others that
are,very interesting.
4950.18,That species is likely
the,"most well-studied,"
4952.82,and it will increase
"LH,",so I would not
4957.02,"consider it an LH mimetic,"
so,it doesn't really mimetic.
4959.9,But it increases the release
of,luteinizing hormone
4962.39,from the pituitary.
4963.29,That's a hormone that
binds,to the Leydig cell
4966.5,to the LH receptor
kind,of like hCG does.
4969.56,And it will increase the
release,of testosterone.
4972.712,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.
4973.67,So I think for people who
aren't,familiar with hCG--
4976.46,so human chorionic
gonadotropin--,
4978.2,is basically synthetic
luteinizing,hormone
4980.247,and luteinizing
hormone,is the hormone
4981.83,released from the
pituitary,that is
4983.288,going to travel
down,to the testes
4985.13,to stimulate the production
of,"sperm and testosterone,"
4988.55,but mainly testosterone.
4989.78,Is that correct?
4991.67,KYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct.
4993.35,"Technically,"
synthetic,LH is also
4995.36,"known as little r LH,"
or,recombinant LH.
4998.33,And hCG can be
"synthetic,","but often, it"
5002.32,is just refined from the
urine,of pregnant ladies
5004.51,since the placenta makes it.
5007.79,That's why it's called
chorionic,gonadotropin.
5010.443,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,where are they
5011.86,getting all this
pregnant,women's urine?
5015.07,"I mean, there a location?"
5017.785,"I mean, not that I want"
to,"go there, I just--"
5019.66,KYLE GILLETT: Donation?
5020.2,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --really--
so,there are women that--
5021.16,KYLE GILLETT: First
trimester,pregnant ladies.
5022.9,It's very high.
5023.53,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Donating,"their urine,"
5025.113,"and then they're purifying it,"
and,then men are injecting it?
5028.99,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
5029.83,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.
5030.55,KYLE GILLETT: And
that's,actually
5031.51,the same for menopausal ladies.
5033.19,So first trimester
pregnant,"ladies,"
5035.14,that's how you can
make,non-synthetic hCG.
5040.42,And then for menotropins
which,are also known--
5044.14,there's a couple of different
names,"for it, like menopur."
5047.47,You have menopausal ladies
that,"have very high LH and FSH,"
5050.71,and then you refine
the,FSH and LH.
5053.77,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving
away,from the sources
5057.28,"and from urine, Fadogia"
"agrestis,",what dosages
5061.51,do you have patients take?
5063.1,I've heard of some
potential,toxicity
5066.04,to the testicular cells.
5067.51,KYLE GILLETT: There
is,one study--
5068.93,"and this is a rat study, but you"
can,equate the dose of toxicity
5073.06,in rats and humans.
5074.08,They did not give these
rats,"any antioxidants,"
5076.88,but it increases a couple
of,different proinflammatory
5081.45,markers.
5081.95,"One is GGT, or gamma"
glutamate,transferase.
5084.67,It comes from both the
testes,"and the liver,"
5086.9,"and one is alkaline phosphatase,"
also,"known as Alkphos, again,"
5091.01,coming from both areas.
5092.392,There are several
different,ways that you
5094.1,can attenuate this increase.
5095.7,And you can also just check
to,see if you have increased.
5098.48,In the rat dose that equates
with,humans that had no
5102.11,effect-- so the safe dose--
5103.85,was an average of
300,milligrams a day.
5106.49,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that
would,be 300 milligrams a day
5108.74,in humans is the dosage
that,did not have toxicity.
5112.71,Correct?
5113.21,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
5114.127,"And often, even if there"
is,"toxicity in rats,"
5117.77,there is not toxicity in humans.
5119.46,So it's not directly
"equitable,","but to be safe,"
5123.44,another regimen that I have
people,take is 600 milligrams
5126.62,every other day
or,600 milligrams
5128.9,three times a week-- often
"Monday,","Wednesday, Friday."
5131.948,ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is very
interesting,"and relevant,"
5134.24,because I've been taking
fadogia,for some period of time.
5137.45,All my markers
and,tests indicate
5140.39,that there's no toxicity.
5141.77,But I've been taking
600,"milligrams per day,"
5145.35,but I've been cycling it for
about,8 to 12 weeks on and then
5149.48,a few weeks off.
5150.56,But based on what
you're,"saying, I'm"
5152.15,thinking maybe three times
per,week or every other day
5154.873,might be better.
5155.54,Is that right?
5156.355,KYLE GILLETT: If you weren't
going,"to get any labs,"
5158.48,that is certainly the
regimen,that you want.
5160.43,If you're going to check
your,"GGT and ALK phos,"
5163.43,or even take other things to
prevent,"those from increasing,"
5166.73,then you can certainly be more
aggressive,with your fadogia
5170.99,dosing.
5171.86,You can increase it
quite,"a bit, and it"
5173.87,has a dose dependent response in
both,the activities associated
5178.07,with high testosterone and
also,just LH and testosterone.
5182.21,So the more aggressive
regimen,would
5184.22,be 600 milligrams
daily,for a month
5186.95,and then take one
to,two weeks off.
5188.542,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
5189.5,I think that's more or
less,what I've been doing.
5192.89,Terrific.
5193.85,In terms of other
"hormones,",what are
5195.77,some of the supplements that
can,support growth hormone--
5198.675,a hormone that's
associated,with tissue
5200.3,"repair and, in some cases,"
metabolism,and fat loss?
5203.9,What are some of the
"tools,",nutritional and/or
5206.75,"supplement-based, one can do"
to,tap on the growth hormone
5211.83,pathway?
5212.33,And let's lump
IGF-1,in there too
5214.4,since they're
essentially,working
5215.87,along the same dimensions.
5217.452,KYLE GILLETT: A quick
synopsis--,growth hormone
5219.41,"is a peptide hormone, and it"
is,released by the pituitary.
5224.21,There's growth hormone
releasing,hormone and ghrelin
5227.315,that stimulate the release.
5228.44,So there's also peptides that
are,very analogous to these two
5231.95,things.
5233.24,You have that
pulsatile,secretion
5235.61,of growth hormone in a very
fast,"half life of just minutes,"
5238.46,and then it increases IGF-1.
5240.65,There is both peripheral IGF-1
and,"central IGF-1 and IGF2,"
5244.49,but no need to get
into,the specifics.
5247.58,There is a happy medium to
where,your growth hormone is
5251.09,at an adequate level and your
IGF-1,is an adequate level.
5254.54,"Usually, those"
two,are congruent.
5256.62,"So in most cases, we just check"
an,"IGF-1 and, occasionally,"
5260.54,the binding peptides
for,IGF-1 kind
5262.73,of like SHBG that we
talked,"about earlier,"
5265.1,but you're estimating
a,free IGF-1.
5269.0,It's kind of confusing
because,all hormone--
5271.55,almost all hormones have binding
proteins,to help regulate them.
5275.27,"But often, you want to"
look,"at free testosterone,"
5277.67,"free estradiol, free IGF-1--"
5280.28,or at least estimate
it--,"free cortisol even,"
5283.04,and free thyroid hormone.
5285.68,But when you're talking about
growth,"hormone and IGF-1,"
5290.63,usually you don't need to
do,anything to optimize it.
5294.14,"If you are diabetic,"
then--,and depending
5298.37,"on the type of diabetes,"
your,IGF-1 and growth hormone
5301.7,can be too high.
5303.53,"Specifically, in"
type,"1 diabetes,"
5305.91,your growth hormone is extremely
"high,",but your IGF-1 is low.
5309.83,So if you're in a dysregulated
state,"or have pathology,"
5313.04,I would just talk to your doctor
about,IGF-1 or growth hormone.
5317.33,Taking amino acids
before,you go to bed
5319.4,could potentially help
with,growth hormone release
5322.07,just because most growth hormone
is,released while you sleep.
5326.553,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've
heard,that fasting
5328.22,can increase growth hormone.
5329.85,And I know there are certain
patterns,of weight training
5332.96,that can increase
growth,hormone.
5334.64,Some of those regimens
in,the weight room
5337.04,that increase growth hormone
have,been covered by Dr. Duncan
5341.24,"French, who was a"
guest,"on this podcast,"
5344.48,and so maybe we'll refer
people,to that episode
5348.86,for the specific protocols--
these,high volume training.
5351.983,KYLE GILLETT: During
those,"training exercises,"
5353.9,it usually does it transiently
for,a period of a few hours.
5357.6,And a lot of this IGF-1 is
released,by the muscle itself.
5362.82,So it's not necessarily
released,by the liver.
5365.33,IGF-1 that is released
directly,due to growth hormone
5368.84,"signaling-- usually, the"
growth,hormone comes from
5371.12,the pituitary and binds to
the,"liver where usually,"
5374.12,it has a half life
of,"about a week,"
5375.8,where the paracrine
or,autocrine--
5377.72,think of it as like the
peripherally,acting or acting
5380.51,"in the muscles itself,"
which,is also helpful--
5383.63,is released and is not as
concerning,because it's not
5387.68,related to insulin
"resistance,",but it is
5391.19,related to the training itself.
5393.44,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So fasting
and,growth hormone--
5397.12,is it true that fasting can
increase,growth hormone?
5399.7,And maybe as a little
related,"tangent,"
5403.51,I've heard that limiting
food,intake for the two hours
5406.383,before going to
sleep,can increase
5407.8,the pulse of growth hormone that
one,experiences during sleep.
5410.65,"Of course, everyone gets a pulse"
of,"growth hormone during sleep,"
5413.317,but especially
carbohydrate-laden,meals
5415.51,can blunt that peak that
occurs,during sleep quite
5419.11,substantially.
5419.9,So two questions-- does avoiding
food,intake in the two hours
5425.32,prior to sleep help increase
growth,hormone release?
5428.02,Maybe it's being
overly,neurotic.
5429.55,Maybe people need to avoid food
in,the four hours before sleep.
5433.27,"But regardless, what is the"
relationship,between fasting
5436.405,and growth hormone release?
5437.53,I find this really interesting.
5438.88,KYLE GILLETT: Fasting
certainly,potently increases
5441.7,growth hormone release.
5443.24,"However, the IND binding to"
the,receptor is less sensitive.
5449.51,So although fasting does
increase,"growth hormone,"
5453.37,the genes that are
downstream,to it--
5455.83,both the growth
hormone,genes and IGF-1
5458.71,related gene transcription
activity--,will not
5462.73,be significantly higher.
5464.6,"However, if you are optimizing"
the,growth hormone that
5468.88,is released as a
pulsatile,"secretion,"
5472.45,it is helpful to avoid
eating,for two hours.
5475.03,So the general rule of thumb
is,avoid eating about two hours
5477.55,before bed.
5478.09,I think that's clinically
significant,and helpful.
5480.46,But fasting otherwise
specifically,for growth hormone
5483.55,optimization in
someone,who already
5485.86,has normal growth hormone
signaling,is not helpful.
5489.28,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's,extremely useful
5491.68,to hear because one
of,the major reasons
5493.778,why people fast is to get
that,growth hormone increase.
5496.07,But if they're adjusting things
on,the backend that negate
5499.45,"that, well, then, no such luck."
5502.872,Not that I have anything
against,fasting.
5504.58,I do a pseudointermittent
fasting,mostly
5506.77,because I prefer to eat at
fairly,regular times of day.
5511.127,So it doesn't sound
like,there's a lot
5512.71,that people can take
in,supplement form
5514.72,to improve growth hormone.
5515.83,What about thyroid hormone?
5516.88,What are some of the things that
people,can take or do in order
5519.505,to make sure that their thyroid
hormone,levels are appropriate?
5524.397,KYLE GILLETT: You want to
have,a balance of iodine
5526.48,and you want to have a
good,source of iodine.
5528.355,So there are some
camps,that say you
5530.02,should use a huge
high,dose of iodine
5532.75,and there's protocols for it.
5534.138,And there are some that say you
should,use just barely enough
5536.68,iodine--
5537.58,I believe it's like
200,micrograms per day.
5540.41,But you want to balance.
5542.57,One of the things that I
see,that many people do not
5545.38,talk about when it comes
to,iodine and thyroid
5548.62,is there's compounds
known,as goitrogens.
5553.06,And these goitrogens are
neither,"good nor evil,"
5556.21,but they're actually kind
of,a nice check and balance.
5559.42,You need more iodine if you
consume,more goitrogens.
5562.63,And some examples of these are
some,of my favorite foods--
5566.47,cruciferous vegetables.
5568.0,Boron is also a goitrogen.
So,"higher goitrogens,"
5572.65,higher iodine.
5574.51,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,ingesting iodine
5576.67,containing salt is useful?
5578.41,Yes or no?
5580.1,KYLE GILLETT: Iodized
salt,"does prevent goiter,"
5582.77,but it is not necessarily
the,ideal form of iodine.
5586.97,Good forms of iodine
often,come from the ocean.
5589.64,If you look at a chart
of,"hypothyroidism,"
5592.31,there is a tendency to have
more,hypothyroidism the more
5595.31,inland you go.
5597.16,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So trying to
eat,some cruciferous vegetables
5600.46,each day would be the best way
to,improve thyroid hormone.
5604.24,KYLE GILLETT: Along
with,plenty of iodine.
5606.01,You don't want too
much,iodine signaling.
5608.02,Many people are familiar with
radioactive,"iodine tablets,"
5611.17,and that's basically an
extremely,high amount of iodine
5614.02,to block out the
radioactive,iodine that
5618.37,comes from after like a
nuclear,meltdown or whatnot.
5622.04,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So we've got
"creatine,","betaine, l-carnitine,"
5627.02,with allicin garlic
to,offset the TMAO.
5630.62,"Vitamin D3, boron, tongkat"
"ali,","fadogia, some fasting."
5635.74,I'd love to talk to
you,about peptides.
5638.06,So I can imagine a hierarchy.
5639.92,A hierarchy starts with
behaviors,and nutrition.
5643.323,"Behaviors, of course,"
includes,"training,"
5644.99,"and limiting stress, and all the"
things,we talked about before--
5648.2,sunshine et cetera--
and,optimize nutrition.
5652.28,"Then, we talked"
about,supplements--
5655.19,all the things we just listed
off,to optimize testosterone.
5659.06,And we can get into
"this,",but estrogen
5661.158,"as well, which is important"
for,"libido, and brain"
5663.2,"function, and tissue function,"
and,"joints feeling good, et"
5665.76,cetera.
5666.41,But then we get into the realm
where,"one might, or could"
5669.47,"consider, exogenous hormones."
5671.45,Get-- taking a small
dose,of testosterone
5673.28,or taking a small dose of GH
even,if that were appropriate
5677.932,and certainly only
working,with a doctor.
5679.64,"But in between, there's a"
step,of so-called peptides.
5682.785,"And of course, there"
are,many peptides.
5684.41,We've already talked
about,some of them.
5685.86,But when people talk
about,"taking peptides,"
5687.652,the ones that I hear
most,often about
5689.3,is a category that
increases,"GH and IGF-1,"
5695.42,and those to my knowledge go by
the,things like sermorelin sort
5703.19,of a kit of things that
are,taken separately
5706.25,or in combination to
increase,GH and IGF-1.
5709.43,But then other
"people,","for instance,"
5711.08,are taking peptides like
BPC,157 to try and improve
5715.67,tissue healing and recovery.
5717.38,There's a lot of
interest,in peptides.
5719.87,"Please, if you would,"
tell,us about what
5722.45,you know about the
safety,of peptides
5724.19,in terms of their sourcing
and,the utility of peptides.
5727.49,Is this something that people
should,consider before thinking
5730.43,about hormone replacement?
5731.6,Should people be
wary,of these things?
5733.52,I am very wary of
particular,sources that are
5735.86,sold online that are not clean.
5737.99,They contain contaminants
and,that could be dangerous.
5740.24,I really would love your
thoughts,on peptides.
5742.28,So I'm just going to sit back
and,"let you riff on peptides,"
5745.33,but if you could touch on some
of,"the ones that I mentioned,"
5747.83,I'd be most grateful.
5750.02,KYLE GILLETT: A
peptide,is just a chain
5752.12,of amino acids between two and
a,couple hundred in length.
5755.96,So I think of peptides as
several,different categories.
5759.41,And the GHRPs that
you,"mentioned,"
5762.05,I would consider those--
5763.43,and that stands for Growth
Hormone,Releasing Peptide.
5766.79,You have two main types--
5768.84,the ghrelin agonist that
are--,or they hit the ghrelin
5773.45,"receptor, and it helps release"
growth,hormone because of that.
5777.96,And then also the
GHRH-like,peptides.
5781.97,So they're very similar to
growth,hormone releasing
5784.13,hormone.
5784.64,"Often, they just change"
a,"couple amino acids,"
5787.28,and it acts like that.
5789.41,"Tesamorelin is one of them,"
sermorelin,"is another one,"
5792.86,and CJC is another common one.
5796.16,I believe those are all in the
class,"of GHRH-like peptides,"
5800.21,whereas ipamorelin or
"ibutamoren,",which is also
5803.54,"known as MK-677, those two"
are,in the class of ghrelin
5808.23,agonist.
5808.73,So they're more like
they,hit the receptor
5810.83,that ghrelin does whereas
the,other ones hit the GHRH
5814.07,receptor.
5814.76,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think of
ghrelin,as making me hungry.
5816.86,KYLE GILLETT: Hungry and angry.
5817.91,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Why,would I want
5819.285,to take something that would
increase,ghrelin signaling?
5822.26,KYLE GILLETT: Some people
are,trying to gain weight.
5824.67,It also does increase
your,growth hormone.
5826.77,So if your growth hormone is
very,"low, you can consider it."
5829.76,Ibutamoren is a long-acting--
so,"it has a long half life, also"
5833.72,known as MK-677.
5834.47,It was well-- it
was,studied mostly
5837.56,in growth hormone deficiency.
5839.78,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And do
these,people get angry also?
5842.332,KYLE GILLETT: They can.
5843.29,Many people report a
side,effect of anxiety
5847.34,or significant hunger.
5849.2,Most people take
it,in the evening
5851.09,so they don't notice
that,hunger as much.
5853.74,It can also greatly
increase,your blood glucose.
5856.232,So if you're insulin
resistant,"or pre-diabetic,"
5858.19,it gets especially concerning.
5860.765,ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is one of
those,rare moments where I hear
5863.39,"something and I think, even"
though,there is this kit
5868.25,of compounds that can
increase,"GH and IGF-1,"
5870.53,based on everything
you're,"telling me,"
5872.57,maybe just taking GH is the
better,"option for those people,"
5876.05,"because growth hormone,"
at,least it's--
5878.06,synthetic growth
hormone,is mimicking
5879.77,an endogenous hormone.
5881.09,"I mean, certainly not taking"
anything,might be the ideal.
5884.557,But for those that want
to,increase growth hormone
5886.64,and they want to
use,pharmacology
5888.015,"to do that, it sounds like these"
peptides,are pretty precarious.
5892.547,"KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, it kind"
of,depends on the situation.
5894.88,If there's an individual
that,struggles with hunger
5899.37,and not eating enough--
5900.45,"for example, someone who has"
a,very small stomach or they
5905.7,just have a very
low,"hunger drive,"
5907.95,sometimes you want more of
that,orexigenic signaling.
5911.94,"The hypothalamus, you have"
anorexia,"signaling, which"
5914.88,"is kind of like anorexia,"
and,"orexigenic signaling,"
5917.83,which is--
5918.6,I call it the hangry
center,of the hypothalamus
5922.41,or the hangry center.
5923.88,And if there's an imbalance
between,"those two, then"
5927.15,perhaps it'd be helpful.
5929.04,Potentially theoretically
helpful,"in anorexics, of which,"
5933.09,the incidence of anorexia in
men,is increasing significantly.
5935.708,ANDREW HUBERMAN: As
you're,"telling me this,"
5937.5,I'm remembering being
14,"or 15 years old,"
5939.93,and I would go into
the,"kitchen sometimes,"
5942.21,and I was so hungry I would
just,obliterate all the food.
5945.69,And I do remember being--
5946.89,I've always been a
pretty,"high energy guy,"
5948.64,but having an immense
amount,of energy.
5950.53,I can't recall if it was
a,"hangry feeling or not,"
5952.68,but I'm guessing that
was,growth hormone.
5954.388,I grew one foot in a
single,"academic year,"
5956.43,so I imagine that was at least
in,part due to growth hormone.
5960.45,"In any case, sermorelin"
is,the peptide
5963.45,that I hear most often about.
5965.49,I admittedly tried a run of it.
5967.86,I was researching
a,"book, and decided"
5970.62,to take it before sleep
on,an empty stomach.
5973.26,It gave me a tremendous
depth,"of sleep,"
5977.71,but that sleep was
really,"truncated,"
5979.65,which is just nerd speak for
saying,deep but short sleep.
5982.29,I would wake up after
very,intense dreams.
5984.51,I can't say that it helped
me,recover from exercise that
5986.98,much.
5987.48,I didn't notice any additional
fat,loss or anything.
5990.21,Sort of abandoned it
except,for occasional use.
5992.515,"Again, this was"
prescribed,by a doctor.
5996.96,I'm starting to get the
sense,that these peptides
5999.12,and their effects are somewhat
"vague,","and distributed,"
6001.43,and highly individual.
6002.69,Is that a fair way
to,describe them?
6005.15,KYLE GILLETT: Part
of,the problem
6007.13,with the effect of peptides
is,many people take them
6010.25,and levels that are far
above,the physiologic range.
6015.2,Even individuals who are
checking,their IGF-1 while they
6018.71,take these different
"GHRPs,",most of them
6022.91,do not check the binding
peptides--,"for example,"
6025.91,"IGF binding peptide 1, 2, or 3."
6029.06,And their free IGF-1 level might
be,significantly different.
6033.81,So common doses that people
will,take these off-label
6038.78,for as a supplement
are,often much greater
6042.38,than the therapeutic
or,physiologic range.
6044.745,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which, for"
"me,",just underscores the fact
6047.12,that it's pretty precarious.
6048.287,"I mean, I'm not coming in"
here,as the referee of what
6050.66,anyone should or shouldn't do.
6052.43,I'm just trying to gather
and,distribute information.
6055.1,"But I've heard, for instance,"
that,some companies where
6058.28,people can acquire these
things,"without prescription,"
6060.74,those companies are not
good,at cleaning out
6063.17,the lipopolysaccharide--
the,LPS--
6066.05,which can cause an
inflammatory,response.
6068.12,"In other words, these"
are,dirty compounds.
6070.73,And that just sounds risky.
6072.98,It just sounds--
"frankly,",it just
6075.11,sounds really dangerous to me.
6076.61,KYLE GILLETT: LPS is a common
additive,in many companies
6080.54,that are not
"pharmacies,",but they're
6083.69,selling things that people
often,use as human consumption.
6086.93,One interesting note
about,lipopolysaccharide
6089.45,is your gut microbiome actually
makes,"a lot of it as well,"
6092.85,especially prevotella which
is,"a specific species, that"
6096.74,can have to do with your
baseline,body temperature.
6100.47,So your baseline
body,temperature
6102.26,might also change depending
on,if you're on a peptide that
6105.68,has LPS in it.
6106.89,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes,"
"yikes,",and yikes.
6109.4,[CHUCKLES] But I tend to
be,pretty conservative
6112.4,when it comes to taking
anything,exogenous.
6114.41,But I do rely on many
of,the supplements
6116.15,that we talked about earlier
and,I do try and optimize
6118.4,the behavioral things
and,nutritional things
6120.8,for a long time.
6122.3,So then leaving
peptides,"behind, we"
6127.04,are now I suppose in the
territory,of exogenous hormone.
6130.14,So let's say that
somebody,decides
6133.358,they're not concerned
with,"fertility,"
6134.9,"or they're going to bank sperm,"
or,"they already have kids,"
6137.75,or they're going to defer
on,this issue of wanting
6139.91,"to have kids, my"
understanding,is
6142.22,"that nowadays, a lot of people"
are,using testosterone--
6144.823,let's not even
call,it replacement
6146.24,"therapy, because some of"
these,"people have 600, 700,"
6149.33,or even 800 nanogram
per,deciliter read.
6152.21,So they're not replacing
anything,that is diminished.
6154.832,They're just trying to
augment,what's already there--
6157.04,increase what's already there.
6158.46,My understanding is that taking
a,low dose more frequently
6162.14,is going to be more beneficial
than,the kind of old school
6165.02,way of giving 100 or
even,200 milligrams
6168.11,in a single injection
once,every two weeks.
6170.287,Is that right?
6170.87,And what do you do
with,your patients?
6172.513,So let me give you
a,hypothetical.
6173.93,"Somebody comes into your office,"
they,"do their blood work,"
6177.68,and they have blood
levels,"of, let's say,"
6181.16,600 nanogram per
deciliter,testosterone.
6183.65,Their estrogen is
also,in normal range.
6186.14,Everything else checks
"out,",but they're
6188.12,complaining of slightly
diminished,"libido, slightly"
6191.36,"poor recovery from workouts,"
maybe,reduced motivation
6195.7,"and drive, although"
no,major depression.
6197.62,And you come to the conclusion
that,testosterone therapy--
6200.95,"not replacement, but"
testosterone,therapy
6202.96,might be a good
option,to explore.
6204.43,What's a typical dosage
range,and frequency
6208.03,of administration range that
you,might consider exploring?
6212.517,KYLE GILLETT: And some of
this,depends on the SHBG
6214.6,and free testosterone as well.
6216.05,So if that same individual had
a,"very high SHBG which, again,"
6219.31,is the binding
protein,that binds up
6220.93,the testosterone and all
androgens,"and estrogens,"
6223.75,if it is extremely
high,and they have
6225.79,a free testosterone
of,"two, then they"
6228.91,might need a different
dose,because they
6230.74,need enough
testosterone,in order
6232.42,to have a normal eugonadal
free,testosterone.
6237.91,But a general normal dosing
"range,",especially for someone
6241.09,"starting, is around"
100,to 120 milligrams
6244.93,divided over the course
of,"a week, usually"
6248.08,either every other day or three
times,"a week-- occasionally,"
6251.23,twice a week.
6252.28,Many people with
SHBG,a bit higher
6255.14,can get away pretty
easily,with twice a week.
6257.38,This is assuming that the ester
is,cypionate or enanthate.
6260.59,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So two
60,milligram injections
6263.23,of testosterone
cypionate,per week.
6264.815,"KYLE GILLETT: Yeah,"
very,common dosing.
6266.44,ANDREW HUBERMAN: To hit
that,120 milligrams per week
6268.607,is kind of the typical average.
6269.92,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
6270.837,And I would consider this like
a,physiologic eugonadal dose.
6274.3,"For many people, even"
200,milligrams a week
6277.42,is far above the
reference,range.
6279.97,All of this is said
with,the caveat
6281.71,that testosterone is normally
released,in a pulsatile manner.
6285.89,So it's high in the
"morning,",low in the evening.
6287.92,Whereas if you're on
testosterone,"therapy,"
6291.22,then you're going to
have,a steady state.
6294.832,So your testosterone
level,is going
6296.29,to be pretty much the
same,even in the evening.
6299.56,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
in,"your experience,"
6301.88,when patients do
"that,",I'm guessing
6303.86,they report that
normal,constellation
6305.54,of positive effects--
6306.71,"improved mood, improved energy,"
improve,"sleep, recovery,"
6309.74,et cetera.
6310.91,What are some of the
hazards,or things that
6313.67,can crop up in bloodwork
or,just subjectively
6316.37,that can be warning signs
that,even a dosage of 120
6319.91,milligrams divided into these
two,or three dosages per week
6322.97,is too high?
6324.5,KYLE GILLETT: Every
organ,system in the body.
6326.43,So this is when you
really,have to be
6329.33,at least well-versed in
every,"organ system, not just"
6333.56,the gonadal genital system.
6337.67,You need to have
dermatology,prowess.
6341.84,Acne is very common change.
6344.06,Lots of different skin
pathologies,or even bruising
6347.54,can be related to
hormone,replacement.
6349.64,Hair loss is very
common,to see as well.
6352.73,Mental status changes.
6354.35,It could occasionally
even,induce
6356.27,as a manic or a bipolar episode
because,testosterone is also
6359.63,dopaminergic.
6361.01,And then a cardiovascularly
not,"just in the heart,"
6364.01,but also concerns for like
microvascular,ischemic disease.
6367.61,Ferritin buildup because
the,estrogen also increases.
6371.22,And then fertility concerns as
well,and lipid concerns too.
6375.74,So you really have to be
"hematologist,","dermatologist,"
6378.8,"cardiologist, lipidologist,"
the,whole 9 yards.
6383.6,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,another reason--
6385.73,or set of reasons
rather,"to, if one"
6389.45,is considering using
testosterone,"therapy,"
6391.43,to really do this in
close,communication
6393.98,with a really good
physician,because that's
6396.11,a lot to monitor.
6396.818,Knowing whether or not you
have,"acne or not is one thing,"
6399.193,but knowing whether or
not,"your LDL is going up,"
6401.202,"your ApoB is going up,"
that's,a whole other biz
6403.16,and that needs to be
done,through bloodwork
6404.952,is what I'm hearing.
6405.813,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
6406.73,And if your physician that
is,managing or prescribing
6410.0,your testosterone
therapy,or your HRT
6413.96,is not well-versed
in,"these systems,"
6416.03,you would want him
or,her to be part
6417.83,of an interdisciplinary
team,where
6419.51,they have other experts that
can,monitor those systems.
6423.057,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
skipped,over a sort
6424.64,of still intermediate set of
things--,prescription drugs--
6428.3,but maybe talking
about,testosterone
6430.52,first was a bit of
a,mistake on my part
6432.2,because I'm aware that
there,"are-- actually,"
6434.722,"I think there are companies,"
but,certainly groups out there
6437.18,"that say, no, wait-- don't"
go,straight from nothing
6440.78,to supplements to testosterone.
6442.16,Once you're doing
behaviors,and optimizing
6444.59,nutrition supplements--
6446.24,let's forget peptides--
instead,of going straight
6448.43,"to testosterone therapy, one"
idea,that many people are
6452.18,pursuing is to take the
prescription,drugs that trigger
6456.53,luteinizing hormones--
so,taking hCG--
6459.05,"human chorionic gonadotropin,"
which,my understanding is
6463.1,"will increase testosterone,"
but,also estrogen.
6465.26,Or they'll take things
like,clomiphene.
6467.475,"In fact, I think there are a"
bunch,of companies out there
6469.85,now that are saying don't take
testosterone--,it shuts down
6472.55,"spermatogenesis, it shuts"
down,testosterone production--
6475.61,clomiphene is the way to go.
6477.78,Maybe you could educate us
about,"the hCG monotherapy,"
6481.135,"I think it's called, where"
you're,just mono-- one--
6483.26,just taking hCG and
clomiphene,as a--
6487.49,and/or clomiphene as a tool
to,ratchet up hormones.
6492.633,KYLE GILLETT: So a
quick,points on hCG--
6494.3,human chorionic
gonadotropin--,made
6496.79,during especially the first
trimester,"of pregnancy,"
6499.16,it has effects other than
binding,to the LH receptor.
6502.97,It also binds to the TSH
receptor,in the thyroid.
6505.952,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it's
thyroid,stimulating hormone?
6508.16,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
6508.91,"In fact, if you look at a"
molecule,of hCG and thyroid
6512.27,"stimulating hormone, they"
are,extremely similar.
6515.97,"However, you need a"
relatively,high dose of hCG
6518.81,to bind to the TSH receptor.
6520.59,This is the normal
mechanism,in pregnancy
6522.71,that accounts for the increased
need,of thyroid hormone--
6526.01,"usually, about 30% to 40%."
6528.09,So that's why if someone
has,"hypothyroidism,"
6530.51,you increase their
dose,"of thyroid,"
6532.19,because the hCG is not going
to,be doing it for you.
6535.88,"The Clomid, or clomiphene,"
there's,two main--
6540.05,I believe it's diastereomers.
6542.36,And one of them is
enclomiphene,and one of them
6544.43,is zuclomiphene.
6546.32,And these two work
slightly,differently.
6548.99,"Enclomiphene, I believe,"
has,a faster half life
6552.56,and it is potentially
slightly,better tolerated.
6556.74,"However, they were studying it--"
6559.84,Clomid is a very
commonly,"prescribed drug,"
6561.59,"and obviously, there is plenty"
of,enclomiphene in Clomid.
6566.24,"However, the drug which"
was,Andrew androxal--
6569.21,A-N-D-R-O-X-A-L-- did not go
all,the way through the FDA
6573.29,approval process despite
Clomid,being FDA approved.
6575.743,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,there's Clomid
6577.16,"which contains clomiphene,"
but,there are also--
6580.28,because we're talking about
male,hormone optimization
6582.98,this episode-- there
are,males out there
6585.56,who want to increase their
testosterone,and other
6588.41,"hormones-- maybe growth hormone,"
et,cetera-- who opt to not take
6592.94,exogenous testosterone-- so
no,"cream, no pellet, no pill,"
6596.72,no injectable cypionate--
but,decide to take clomiphene
6600.95,a couple of times a week.
6603.093,My understanding--
I've,never done this.
6604.76,I would say if I had.
6605.75,My understanding is
that,taking clomiphene--
6609.11,maybe two 50 milligram
tablets,a week
6611.93,is what I hear
people,are doing--
6613.37,will increase what--
luteinizing,"hormone,"
6617.57,the various estrogen
receptor,subunits?
6619.52,Could you explain how
clomiphene,"would benefit anyone,"
6622.01,and is this a good strategy?
6623.27,I'm hearing that it's
being,done quite a lot now.
6626.06,KYLE GILLETT: It will
increase,testosterone
6628.01,in a dose dependent
"manner,",but it
6630.26,has many other
pharmacodynamic,"effects, which"
6632.81,is the effect of
the,drug on the body
6634.97,other than its effect on the
hypothalamus,and the pituitary.
6638.13,So in the hypothalamus
and,"the pituitary,"
6640.68,it does what's called negative
feedback,inhibition or it
6646.85,blocks the action of estrogen.
So,it crowds out estrogen
6650.6,from the estrogen receptor
on,the hypothalamus
6653.99,and the pituitary.
6654.98,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what's
this,objective effect
6656.48,that would cause?
6657.188,So to my understanding
and,experience of estrogen
6660.17,is that if I ever
took--,and I did
6662.36,take a very low dose of an
aromatase,inhibitor once
6664.61,and I felt terrible.
6665.84,"Actually reduced libido,"
joints,felt achy.
6669.08,"That's when I discovered that,"
"wow,",estrogen is actually
6671.54,really important for your brain
"function,","for joint function,"
6674.72,and for libido.
6676.04,And suppressing
"estrogen,","for me, it just"
6678.26,turned out to be the wrong idea.
6679.97,But my levels indicate that
it's,within reference range.
6683.45,So why would I want
to,take something
6686.3,that would increase the activity
of,an estrogen receptor?
6690.2,I just can't find the
rationale,for that.
6692.96,KYLE GILLETT: The main
rationale,behind taking
6695.12,a serm is as a very
temporary,measure that is not
6699.68,going to suppress pituitary
or,hypothalamic function
6703.19,if your testosterone is just
so,drastically low that it
6707.27,is unlikely to recover anyway.
6710.27,So most of the time it
is,"not clinically useful,"
6713.87,and serm should
not,be prescribed
6716.81,"very often, certainly not"
as,long term testosterone
6720.2,replacement or testosterone
optimization,in most
6723.83,individuals.
6724.34,There's always
exceptions,to everything.
6726.56,But there's five
different,estrogen
6730.04,and estrogen-related receptors.
6732.14,There's two main
estrogen,receptors.
6734.72,And clomid and every serm
has,a very unique profile
6739.25,because they selectively inhibit
some,"receptors in some tissues,"
6743.09,but not other receptors
in,other tissues.
6745.25,"For example, Clomid can inhibit"
receptors,"that are in the eye,"
6749.87,"and it can cause visual changes,"
blurry,"vision, especially"
6755.39,at higher doses.
6757.1,And it also acts in every
other,tissue of the body.
6760.65,So a side effects from Clomid
and,other selective estrogen
6764.93,receptor modifiers
are,very common.
6768.103,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So,I'm at least--
6769.52,"by my mind, I'm going to"
pool,them with peptides
6772.28,and say it sounds precarious
and,probably not ideal
6775.31,for most people.
6776.93,Going back to testosterone
therapy,"then-- and notice,"
6779.93,"folks, I've deleted"
the,replacement part
6781.64,because I think so many people
are,using testosterone therapy
6785.72,without the need to-- the
sort,of reference range
6789.23,need to replace
"anything,",but rather are
6793.438,building on what they already
have,for purposes of increasing
6795.98,"vitality, et cetera."
6797.66,"Going back to that,"
my,understanding
6799.82,is that taking hCG
several,times per week
6803.45,can help maintain
spermatogenesis,and fertility
6805.82,even while people
are,on testosterone.
6807.47,But-- and you and I were
talking,about this earlier--
6809.33,that there's
tremendous,variation.
6810.89,Some people will take a
small,amount testosterone
6813.5,and just crush
their,sperm count.
6815.46,They just won't make
any,viable sperm.
6817.22,Other people can maintain
viable,sperm production
6819.8,"while on testosterone,"
especially,
6821.6,if they're taking hCG.
6823.34,Is that right?
6824.12,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
6824.75,And there's many
reasons,for this.
6826.167,Some of this has to do with
heat,"damage to the testes,"
6829.29,so potentially cold therapy
could,be helpful for that.
6832.68,And--
6833.18,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice
"baths,",cold showers?
6834.32,KYLE GILLETT: Mhm.
6835.175,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Yeah,",or just avoid--
6836.21,and certainly avoiding--
6837.59,KYLE GILLETT: Mostly
avoiding,heat.
6838.28,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--sauna,and hot tub.
6838.85,Yeah.
6839.823,KYLE GILLETT: Stopping
the,daily hot tub
6841.49,can restore fertility
in,many people.
6843.44,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
know,a number of people
6845.21,that are trying to
conceive,children that
6847.4,"go into the sauna,"
and,they'll just
6849.59,put a cold pack in their shorts
or,between their legs depending
6852.215,on whether or not they're
wearing,shorts or not
6854.173,when they go in.
6855.2,Or they'll alternate
ice,and heat
6856.88,in a way that maintains
coolness,of the milieu
6862.4,in which the sperm live.
6864.48,"In other words, they're cooling"
their,scrotum deliberately
6868.31,in order to avoid
killing,the sperm.
6870.8,"Actually, I saw an"
interesting,paper
6872.72,that said that for every two
degree,increase in temperature
6878.45,"of the scrotum, there's a 20%"
decrease,in spermatogenesis
6882.26,and viability of sperm.
6884.42,"And that actually, if you"
look,at the difference
6886.76,between people who
stand,"a lot, sit a lot,"
6889.16,"and drive a lot, what you see is"
a,progressive decrease in sperm
6892.49,count because when
people,"are sitting,"
6894.122,there's an increase
in,"temperature,"
6895.58,and then when they're sitting
on,"the hot seat of the car,"
6897.99,there's an-- or using
the,"heated seats,"
6900.53,"actually, it kills sperm."
6901.64,I think there are
good,data on that.
6903.26,"KYLE GILLETT: Yeah,"
excellent,"data,"
6904.718,"and anecdotally,"
you,see it as well.
6906.6,I've had several patients come
in,for fertility consultations.
6910.61,"And all we do is like, no"
"medications,",no supplements.
6914.06,We change their--
several,lifestyle things.
6918.74,Very tight fitting
clothing,is another one.
6920.96,"And soon, they have fertility"
again,and they're no longer--
6925.01,they have sperm whereas
"before,",they did not.
6928.58,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
6930.74,I'd like to talk about some
of,"the do's and don'ts, but we"
6933.897,have talked about a lot of
do's--,things that one can do
6936.23,to optimize hormones.
6937.23,Maybe we could just do sort
of,more rapid fire Q&A on some
6941.9,of the don'ts and maybe throw
in,some science where you feel
6945.92,it's appropriate.
6947.75,"Cannabis, marijuana,"
THC--,yes or no--
6951.08,it diminishes
testosterone,levels?
6955.05,KYLE GILLETT: Smoked
"cannabis,","I would say,"
6957.9,"diminishes testosterone,"
increases,prolactin.
6960.63,That's a no.
6961.53,"Other cannabinoids, not"
particularly,harmful.
6964.36,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So CBD?
6966.51,"KYLE GILLETT: CBD, not"
particularly,harmful.
6968.58,"Smoked CBD, I'm not sure."
6971.19,ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about
edible,cannabis and THC?
6974.31,KYLE GILLETT: As far as I
"know,",edible cannabis and THC
6977.07,does not significantly
increase,prolactin to a point
6980.25,where it would be
disruptive,of hormones.
6983.52,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Can
"marijuana,","THC, cannabis,"
6986.172,whatever you want to call
"it,",increase gynecomastia--
6988.38,the growth of male
breast,tissue?
6989.91,"KYLE GILLETT: Yes,"
it,"certainly can,"
6991.59,and there's a pretty good
association,between smoked THC
6995.37,and gynecomastia.
6997.55,ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about
nicotine,and testosterone
7000.64,and estrogen and other
hormones--,smoked nicotine?
7004.49,KYLE GILLETT: Nicotine
is,particularly
7006.1,concerning not only for
"testosterone,",but also
7008.23,"for estrogen. Part of it is, if"
you're,talking about nicotine
7011.53,"from tobacco, there's many"
other,"carcinogens in it,"
7013.93,especially if it's smoked.
7015.49,"But nicotine, even"
if,it is chewed
7017.74,in a dose dependent manner--
7019.34,so if you can use an extremely
small,"amount of nicotine,"
7022.75,then it's not as
concerning,in the long run.
7025.34,But it's a
"vasoconstrictor,",and one
7027.88,of the main concerns with it
would,be cardiovascular disease
7031.66,or even microvascular
ischemic,disease that
7036.1,can lead to
neurodegenerative,"disease,"
7038.3,so like a type of dementia that
can,be partly due to nicotine.
7042.01,If you use nicotine for a
very,"long period of time,"
7045.86,especially at a
higher,"dose, it's"
7048.28,a dose-dependent effect
on,your hormone profile.
7052.18,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that
also,true for Nicorette
7054.18,and other nicotine gums?
7056.572,KYLE GILLETT: At
high,"doses, if you"
7058.03,can use an extremely low
dose,"of a nicotine gum,"
7062.65,"then theoretically, that"
would,be maintainable.
7066.97,It's not going to overload
the,nicotinic receptor.
7070.33,You have acetylcholine
and,the cholinergic system
7073.15,is one of your main
nervous,"systems, of course."
7076.03,And you have
muscarinic,receptors
7077.65,"and nicotinic receptors,"
and,there's just
7080.02,better ways to optimize your
nicotinic,receptor activity.
7084.61,"For example,"
acetylcholine,precursors
7086.77,"like alpha GPC,"
"phosphatidylserine,",
7089.23,phosphatidylcholine.
7091.42,Weak acetylcholinesterase
"inhibitors,",
7093.4,especially natural
"ones,",potentially
7094.93,have a part as well.
7097.13,And then other alkaloids.
7098.65,So nicotine is an alkaloid
from,the tobacco plant.
7101.8,There are other
plants,like cytosine
7104.71,"and that genus of plants,"
and,that alkaloid is also
7108.85,a nicotine receptor agonist.
7113.05,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it true
that,cycling for too long--
7116.35,"literally, bicycling-- sitting"
on,a bike seat too long
7119.44,can damage the prostate?
7121.54,"KYLE GILLETT: Yes, it"
can,"be very concerning,"
7123.89,especially if you're seated
while,"cycling, especially"
7126.88,if you're putting a lot of
pressure,on the perineum.
7129.55,Your core is kind
of,like a box where
7132.73,your diaphragm sort of makes the
top,and your abs and serratus
7136.3,make the front and the sides.
7138.4,Your back muscles make the
"back,",and then your pelvic floor
7141.76,makes the bottom
of,"the box, which"
7143.68,is arguably the most
important,part of your core.
7146.74,And that pressure
can,weaken and even
7149.23,lead to incontinence
and,impotence.
7152.798,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So we
were,talking earlier today
7154.84,in the gym about how
heavy,"legwork, hack"
7158.44,"squats, deadlifts, those"
kinds,of things a lot of guys
7160.78,are doing to increase their
"testosterone,","done correctly,"
7164.15,can actually
augment,and build up
7166.12,the strength of
the,pelvic floor.
7167.59,"Done incorrectly, can actually"
weaken,the pelvic floor
7170.05,"and lead to all sorts of issues,"
including,sexual effects--
7172.87,negative sexual effects.
7174.17,So how does one go about
learning,whether or not
7177.76,their movements are
being,done properly
7179.59,to support pelvic floor or
to,destruct pelvic floor?
7185.11,KYLE GILLETT: The pelvic
floor,is a constellation
7187.21,of muscles just
like,any other kind
7188.71,of like system in the body.
7190.36,And form is important.
7194.45,If you're doing the valsalva
"maneuver,","which again,"
7197.54,is that bearing down or deep
breath,where you feel all
7202.55,of your abs are
"tight,",you can also
7204.29,notice that your pelvic
floor,is tight as well.
7207.44,If you have a history of
an,"inguinal hernia, which"
7210.53,is a hole kind of like
connecting,the abdominal cavity
7213.95,down through the
pelvic,floor or even
7215.75,the scrotum in some
cases--,and that
7217.28,can be a sign that there
is,"weakness in that area,"
7221.57,and you might have
to,concentrate it
7223.07,"on it most, or even"
have,a physiotherapist
7225.41,or a physical
therapist,specifically
7228.02,target the pelvic floor.
7229.73,Many exercises in which
you,valsalva or use
7233.3,your glutes or
"legs,",you can learn
7236.39,to squeeze them and have that
mind-muscle,connection in order
7239.87,to help build up
the,pelvic floor.
7241.52,And there's other things.
7242.78,Many people are
familiar,with kegels.
7244.52,That is just one of the
many,different exercises
7247.4,that can help your pelvic floor.
7249.08,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
My,understanding
7249.8,is that while strengthening
the,"pelvic floor is good,"
7252.17,excessive contraction
of,the pelvic floor
7253.97,can actually limit blood flow
to,"the pelvic area, the penis,"
7256.73,and so forth.
7257.43,"So this is, again, a"
double-edged,sword.
7259.88,"I mean, you don't"
want,guys out there
7261.62,to just start doing endless
number,of kegels every day
7263.87,because they're actually
going,to constrict
7265.662,blood flow to that area.
7266.87,"There's-- and in fact,"
the,erection response is
7270.35,parasympathetic.
7271.34,It's a relaxed induced
"response,",right?
7273.363,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
7274.28,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for the--
the,reason I chuckle is that
7277.85,for--
7278.48,because we're
talking,"about things,"
7279.938,we don't have visuals or
"charts,","and certainly, it's"
7282.44,hard to know whether or not
a,given exercise like kegels
7285.89,are going to be
good,or not good.
7288.17,"If it's excessive, what--"
7289.43,how many sets and reps
does,it take before it
7292.7,goes from good to bad.
7294.243,Is there a kind of
general,rule of thumb
7295.91,for people to think about this?
7297.202,"I mean, clearly blood"
flow,to that area
7299.42,is key for sexual performance.
7302.18,And yet when one trains
the,"legs or even walks,"
7305.36,you're getting blood flow.
7306.99,So my understanding is this
that,a combination of weight
7310.67,training to stimulate
the,"positive hormonal,"
7312.77,"and muscular, and"
connective,tissue growth
7315.38,is key provided it's
not,"overtraining,"
7318.05,but so is casual exercise
like,"walking, and stretching,"
7322.257,and the sorts of
things,that will then
7323.84,return blood flow to that area.
7325.46,Is that an overly basic
way,to think about it
7328.7,or will that suffice?
7329.613,KYLE GILLETT: I think that's
a,good way to think about it.
7332.03,I think the main
point,with kegels
7333.77,is they're just one of
many,different things.
7337.14,So if you're having some
pelvic,floor pathology
7339.8,certainly or even just concerned
about,"your pelvic floor,"
7342.92,don't just take the advice
do,kegels and you'll be OK.
7347.21,That is not near enough.
7348.38,It's just one of
the,many aspects.
7351.57,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So going
back,"to the rapid Q&A,"
7353.57,and then we'll come back
to,this issue of blood flow
7355.25,because there's some interesting
science,and protocols there--
7357.89,the question I have
"is,","alcohol, does it"
7360.71,"increase aromatase, the enzyme"
that,converts testosterone
7364.01,into estrogen or not?
7365.42,And is there a dose
dependence,there?
7368.45,KYLE GILLETT: It
significantly,does.
7369.95,There is a dose dependence.
7371.36,"In general, I would not"
recommend,more than three
7375.86,to four standard drinks.
7379.04,One huge glass of wine is
probably,five standard drinks.
7382.34,But I'd say every two weeks.
7386.947,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,"
that's,consistent with what
7389.03,I discovered researching
alcohol,in an episode we
7391.43,did on alcohol.
7392.54,That no alcohol is definitely
better,for all aspects
7396.665,of health than any alcohol.
7397.79,"And anyone that says that,"
"well,",red wine contains
7399.89,"these various things,"
"well,",it doesn't
7401.685,contain enough of
those,positive things
7403.31,to have a positive effect.
7404.393,But that if people do
opt,"to drink alcohol,"
7407.15,that two drinks per week--
7409.22,"and meaning 20 grams of alcohol,"
so,that's probably two 12 ounce
7414.47,beers or two 4 ounce
glasses,of wine--
7417.41,is going to be the upper
limit,beyond which you're
7419.66,going to start seeing all
sorts,of negative effects.
7422.1,KYLE GILLETT: The other thing to
keep,in mind with alcohol is it
7423.905,has a lot of calories--
seven,kilocalories
7426.23,"per gram, almost as"
much,"as fat, which is 9."
7429.2,And then it's also
very,"GABAergic,"
7431.21,so it can activate
inhibitory,"neurotransmission,"
7435.89,and that can also affect how
much,LH and FSH is released.
7442.58,So that can also
decrease,testosterone
7444.89,almost kind of
similar,to how opiates
7448.58,can decrease testosterone.
7450.62,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I feel
very,lucky that I don't enjoy
7453.35,alcohol-- never really did.
7454.71,I can kind of take
it,or leave it.
7456.23,I certainly don't like sedatives
like,Valium or anything
7458.673,"like that, which, as"
you,"just mentioned,"
7460.34,can suppress testosterone.
7462.77,"You said the word fat, so"
I'm,going to pick up on that
7466.25,"and say, in order to"
optimize,"hormone production,"
7469.19,is it important to have some
saturated,fat in one's diet?
7473.24,And what happens on very low
fat,"diets to testosterone,"
7476.47,"and estrogen, and"
other,steroid hormones?
7479.39,KYLE GILLETT: Fat is
interesting,because there are so
7482.06,many different beneficial fats.
7484.1,Omega 3s-- almost every American
gets,plenty of omega 6s--
7488.0,in any developed country really.
7490.25,When it comes to
saturated,"fat, there"
7493.24,is more of a correlation
with,hormone optimisation.
7496.54,If you're eating things
with,"saturated fat,"
7498.79,you tend to have--
7500.05,those are things with more fat
soluble,vitamins and things
7503.68,that are very nutrient
dense,otherwise.
7506.39,But it is not vital.
7507.73,"In general, you want to"
eliminate,any trans fat
7511.18,unless it's trans fat
from,the ruminants.
7513.25,There's always an
exception,to everything.
7515.02,So there are healthy
trans,"omega 3 fats, which"
7518.02,are formed in the
stomach,of grass fed
7520.18,and finished ruminants.
7523.22,ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
ingesting,"mostly olive oils,"
7526.4,maybe nut butters in limited
amounts,because they're
7529.64,"very calorie dense, but--"
7531.193,unless people are trying
to,"increase their calories,"
7533.36,"in which case,"
they're,a great source
7534.902,"of calories, small amounts"
of,"butter, ghee, probably OK,"
7539.027,but not excessive amounts?
7540.11,Is that the idea?
7540.92,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
7541.82,Fat is perfectly fine.
7543.44,Cholesterol has an interesting--
so,"cholesterol and, in general,"
7547.49,phospholipids make the bilayer
that's,around the cell.
7551.42,But cholesterol is also a
hormone,in and of itself
7554.6,because it binds to the
estrogen-related,receptor
7558.05,alpha.
7558.68,So I consider that like in the
estrogen,"receptor category,"
7561.74,and that can help
with,"metabolism,"
7563.55,but also potentially
have,concerns
7565.76,for cancer and tumor risk.
7568.627,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I want
to,go back to the prostate
7570.71,and talk to you about
something,that's
7572.45,kind of a newer emerging trend.
7574.22,I know that you've talked
a,little bit about this
7576.5,"in previous podcasts, that a"
number,of men-- or I should say
7580.4,a number of physicians
are,prescribing
7583.34,"low dose tadalafil,"
also,"known as Cialis,"
7586.46,to their male patients.
7588.09,So in dosage ranges of like
2.5,milligrams to 5 milligrams
7591.56,"per day, but not for"
erectile,"dysfunction,"
7593.6,but rather for improving
prostate,health.
7596.06,"And presumably, they get sort of"
a,boost in terms of blood flow
7599.69,to the genitalia as well.
7601.23,"But again, not specifically to"
deal,"with erectile dysfunction,"
7605.03,but to deal with prostate health
and,blood flow to the prostate.
7609.08,Is that something
that,you sometimes--
7610.94,often prescribe to your
"patients,",and of what age?
7614.72,KYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil is a
very,underrated medication.
7617.57,The age would kind of
depend,on the indication.
7620.99,So tadalafil is also a
blood,pressure medication.
7624.53,It can very slightly
decrease,"blood pressure,"
7626.52,especially at higher doses.
7628.46,"At higher doses, it--"
7630.68,a high dose would be 20
"milligrams,",not 2.5 milligrams.
7634.37,"But consistently,"
it,can somewhat
7636.68,affect with the cones
in,the eye that have
7639.02,to do with red and green sight.
7640.7,"Although, if you remove it,"
that,effect is reversed.
7643.26,"So basically, if you don't need"
"really,",really good red/green
7646.1,"discrimination, you"
can,take higher doses.
7648.24,"But in general, I"
recommend,no higher
7650.27,than 10 milligrams
a,day-- usually just
7652.64,two or 5 milligrams.
7655.49,One other benefit or
other,use of tadalafil
7659.54,is that it increases the
density,of the androgen receptor
7662.78,similarly to l-carnitine.
7665.66,So that's an
interesting,benefit.
7667.07,Another benefit is
that,if you give it
7669.38,to people with
"nocturia,",which is
7671.27,urinating at night
in,"general, it"
7673.03,will cut the episodes in half.
7674.82,So it could go
from,"2 to 1, which"
7677.21,can make a big difference
for,"your sleep, which"
7679.28,will secondarily make a big
difference,for your growth
7681.53,hormone and testosterone
optimization.,
7683.27,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
7684.478,So you said 2.5 to
5,milligrams per day
7686.33,is typical for these
prostate,enhancing effects.
7689.12,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
7690.152,ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you
mentioned,the potential side
7692.36,effects on adjusting
visual,perception.
7694.28,"As a vision scientist,"
that,rings in my mind.
7697.79,But in terms of red/green
color,"discrimination,"
7700.317,I'm guessing unless
you're,going to be
7701.9,a subject in one of the
experiments,in my lab
7704.06,or you want to be
a,"fighter pilot,"
7705.608,chances are you can
probably,get away
7707.15,with a little less red/green
color,discrimination.
7709.233,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
7710.15,It's not considered
clinically,significant
7712.07,unless someone is
a,commercial pilot.
7714.592,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.
7715.55,KYLE GILLETT: So if someone's
getting,"their pilot exam,"
7717.842,that's one of the
things,we look for.
7719.547,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
commercial,"pilots aside,"
7721.38,you might want to ask
your,doctor about low dose
7723.38,tadalafil for sake of
enhancing,prostate health.
7726.77,Certainly monitoring PSA
prostate,specific antigen
7729.438,is important.
7729.98,I can give an anecdote there.
7732.14,"When I tried sermorelin, one"
of,the surprising side effects
7735.83,that was not welcome
was,a dramatic spike
7739.25,in my prostate specific
antigen.,No one
7741.14,could explain to me
why,"that would happen,"
7744.458,but when I stopped
taking,"sermorelin,"
7746.0,it went back to normal.
7747.21,So that's one reason I
avoid,"sermorelin, at least,"
7749.69,frequent use of sermorelin.
7751.73,PSA should be kept--
what--,below levels
7754.07,of somewhere between 1 and
4,is considered healthy?
7757.22,Is that right?
7757.85,KYLE GILLETT: It
depends,on the age.
7759.35,"If there's a 20-year-old,"
likely,between 0 and 1.
7762.35,"If there's a 40-year-old,"
likely,between 1 and 3.
7766.922,And then if there's
an,"80-year-old,"
7768.38,it would not be abnormal
to,have a PSA of 5
7771.17,and have that be well
within,the reference range.
7774.112,Another thing we should
mention,about PSA
7775.82,is if you do take a
5-alpha,reductase inhibitor
7778.67,like finasteride or
"dutasteride,",often
7781.85,these will cut your PSA in half.
7784.26,"So if you-- for example,"
if,you have a PSA of 6
7787.82,and you start finasteride
or,"dutasteride,"
7790.01,and then you recheck it in
six,"months and it's 6.5,"
7793.19,"that is a huge concern, because"
that's,actually doubled.
7796.92,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm glad
you,brought this up because I
7799.23,almost overlooked
the,fact that I
7800.73,get a lot of questions about
drugs,to offset hair loss.
7805.09,Most of those drugs are going
to,operate through the DHT
7807.53,system-- the dihydrotestosterone
system--,for the reasons we
7810.03,talked about before.
7810.863,DHT receptors being on the
scalp,and causing beard growth
7813.75,on the face.
7815.49,Is it the case that a number
of,people taking things
7819.09,like Propecia and other
things,to block the DHT
7822.66,or disrupt the DHT
pathway,are going
7825.48,to experience diminished sex
"drive,",diminished motivation
7831.06,and general vigor?
7832.29,"And if, so are there"
alternatives,like topical DHT
7835.32,antagonists that they
might,use if they
7837.75,"want to keep their hair, but"
not,have those negative effects?
7842.22,KYLE GILLETT: The way that
I,think about hair loss
7844.74,"is you have your fertilizers,"
also,"known as growth agonist,"
7848.85,and then you have
your,anti-androgens.
7851.13,Whether they're systemic
or,"topical, there is both,"
7854.31,but that's the general laymen's
way,to think about hair loss.
7857.55,If you're only putting
fertilizer,in your hair
7859.62,but you have androgenic alopecia
or,"male pattern baldness,"
7862.59,then those hairs will
still,"miniaturize,"
7864.415,"and eventually, you'll"
still,have loss.
7866.04,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Such a
great,word-- miniaturize.
7868.83,It's enough to send anybody
off,to find a therapeutic.
7871.61,KYLE GILLETT: And
by,"the way, it's"
7872.13,difficult to tell
if,miniaturization
7873.72,is happening unless you
have,a magnifying glass.
7876.492,And you can use--
7877.2,ANDREW HUBERMAN: I almost didn't
know--,"for a second there,"
7878.52,I didn't know whether or
not,you were making a joke.
7879.96,You're talking about
miniaturization,
7881.22,of the hair follicle.
7882.15,KYLE GILLETT: Correct.
7882.96,ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what can
reverse,that miniaturization?
7884.88,"Gosh, it's just a"
fun,word to say.
7886.02,I'm going to just
keep,saying it.
7887.395,KYLE GILLETT: Each
individual,has--
7889.08,"again, we mentioned"
the,androgen receptor.
7891.21,Males only have one
androgen,receptor gene
7893.745,that's on their X chromosome.
7895.39,So depending on how sensitive
that,androgen receptor
7898.05,is and depending on the density
of,the receptors in the hair
7902.7,"follicle, you can have"
an,arbitrary threshold.
7906.93,And you don't know
what,this threshold
7908.91,is until you start to
have,miniaturization
7910.83,and loss of hair.
7912.21,"But over the threshold,"
the,follicle will die
7915.57,and eventually the
stem,cell will leave.
7917.4,But under the
"threshold,",you're OK.
7920.67,Every androgen binds to
the,same androgen receptor.
7923.98,So there is nothing
special,about DHT.
7926.55,DHT is just a stronger androgen.
So,the higher your SHBG--
7931.35,things that increase SHBG
are,beneficial for hair loss
7935.7,prevention because you have
less,binding of that receptor.
7939.04,So if you think
about,hair loss--
7940.56,"specifically, androgenic"
or,male pattern
7942.75,baldness in the terms of
that,androgen receptor
7946.2,and everything in
general,binding to it--
7948.51,"not just DHT, but also"
testosterone--,it's helpful.
7951.45,It's just that DHT
is,a huge battering
7954.0,ram whereas the other
androgens,are just
7956.04,light presses on the door.
7957.39,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.
7958.39,So are some of the
topical,DHT receptor
7961.08,antagonists going to be a
better,choice for people
7963.99,that want to maintain their
hair,or grow more hair if they
7968.64,want to avoid side effects?
7970.11,KYLE GILLETT: Likely so.
7971.64,Some individuals
benefit,from systemic--
7975.86,a systemic decrease in DHT
for,a couple of reasons.
7979.0,One could be prostate and
then,one could actually
7981.24,be hypertrophy of
the,myocardium.
7984.28,So DHT also disproportionately
thickens,the ventricle.
7988.09,So for someone on
"TRT,",that might
7989.73,be a benefit that is
prone,to thickening
7991.83,of the ventricle at baseline.
7994.15,"However, many people that have"
just,"a bit of predisposition,"
7998.43,they can use things that
are,topical anti-androgens.
8002.78,Ketoconazole is one
of,"them, caffeine"
8004.91,is actually another one.
8006.05,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wait--
drinking,caffeine?
8007.43,KYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine.
8008.42,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,"
I,was going to say
8008.93,my hair tends to
grow,"pretty fast,"
8010.43,so it might be-- but I
drink,a lot of caffeine.
8012.39,So topical caffeine?
8013.46,"Really, rubbing"
coffee,on their head--
8015.35,KYLE GILLETT: Yes.
8015.59,ANDREW HUBERMAN: --or
taking,caffeine tablets--
8017.69,"and how does it-- wait, you"
have,to explain how this works?
8020.57,How do people get caffeine
into,the hair follicle.
8024.17,"KYLE GILLETT: Topically, the"
caffeine,enters the scalp
8027.26,and crowds out--
8028.91,somewhat crowds out the
androgen.,It is a weak effect.
8032.54,It's likely just strong enough
to,be clinically significant.
8036.11,"Usually, caffeine is put into"
formulations,with other things
8039.2,like ketoconazole that are
also,weak anti-androgens.
8043.49,"Of note, spironolactone can"
be,"prescribed topically,"
8046.65,but it is absorbed
systemically,because the size
8049.34,of the molecule.
8050.43,So unless your
doctor,specifically
8052.49,"prescribes that for you,"
especially,"as a male,"
8054.74,do not use topical
spironolactone.,
8057.17,Topical finasteride is
also,"a smaller molecule,"
8061.11,so it is also
systemically,"absorbed,"
8063.32,but it is not extremely
well,systemically absorbed.
8066.77,If you take topical
"finasteride,",then usually
8069.5,your systemic DHT will
decrease,by about 30%.
8073.43,Topical dutasteride is likely a
tiny,"bit systemically absorbed,"
8077.93,but it's unique
because,it's half life
8079.64,is much faster at a lower dose.
8081.93,So topical dutasteride will
not,affect your systemic DHT
8085.94,"at all, and I've seen this"
anecdotally,on many people
8088.61,on topical dutasteride therapy.
8090.95,ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're going
to,have to get you back on here
8093.45,"to do an episode all about DHT,"
and,"hair loss, and hair growth."
8096.28,"Again, not a topic that I"
focus,"on a lot for myself,"
8099.45,but that I get a
lot,of questions
8101.22,about from men and women.
8102.622,KYLE GILLETT: One thing
that,we could mention--
8104.58,I got a ton of questions about
turmeric,and curcuminoids
8107.76,after the last episode.
8109.052,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,"
"yeah,",I had reported
8110.76,my own anecdotal experience that
taking,turmeric really crushed
8114.42,my DHT levels and I
did,not feel good.
8116.82,"I mean, it crushed all sorts of"
positive,feelings of vitality.
8121.17,The moment I stopped taking
"turmeric,",felt great again.
8124.11,KYLE GILLETT: Many
people,report this.
8125.89,And the interesting
thing,about turmeric
8128.46,is most of it's beneficial
action--,not all of it--
8131.46,some people benefit
from,systemic turmeric.
8134.037,And some people that
can,"tolerate it-- well,"
8135.87,it's actually great
for,the prostate.
8138.06,"But most of the action, it does"
not,need to be bioavailable.
8141.75,It acts on the gut microbiome.
8144.43,"So you can take turmeric,"
and,if it is not absorbed--
8148.05,some turmeric is put in special
formulations,"like micellar,"
8151.2,"or liposomal, or complexed."
8153.6,But a lot of it is put
with,black pepper fruit
8155.82,"extract, which is also known"
as,"bioperine, which is actually"
8158.7,also a 5-alpha
reductase,inhibitor
8161.14,and it affects liver cytochrome.
8163.44,And so many supplement companies
put,this black pepper fruit
8166.26,extract--
8166.92,bioperine-- in
almost,everything.
8169.17,So some people are
on,"really high doses,"
8171.51,and that could
also,be making most
8174.12,of the effect of people who
do,not tolerate turmeric well.
8177.42,"ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I avoid"
turmeric,like the plague based
8180.27,on that one previous
experience,because it
8182.04,was clearly turmeric that
caused,the negative effect.
8186.69,"Coming off it, everything"
reversed,rapidly.
8189.0,And the bioperine-- the
black,pepper extract--
8191.712,I also avoid that like the
plague,based on everything
8193.92,you just said.
8195.03,I want my 5-alpha
"reductase,",I want my DHT
8198.69,to be optimized simply
because,my understanding is
8202.139,DHT is the more
powerful,androgen
8205.591,"and it's the one that-- yes,"
it,causes a little bit of hair
8208.049,loss and I've got a few
patches,"here and there,"
8210.209,but I'm willing
to,live with that
8211.855,based on all the
other,wonderful things
8213.48,that DHT optimization does.
8216.36,I'll quickly mention
a,few other things.
8218.41,"One, saw palmetto is"
also,a 5-alpha reductase
8221.76,"inhibitor, but only a"
couple,of the isoenzymes.
8224.549,"There's three main isoenzymes,"
and,a lot of the problem
8228.059,is that you're inhibiting
a,"couple of the isoenzymes,"
8231.24,but not the other one.
8232.709,Finasteride inhibits 1 and 2.
8236.61,Dutasteride actually
inhibits,all three.
8239.129,And finasteride
inhibits,the isoenzyme
8242.79,"that is in genital skin, but not"
in,the skin throughout the rest
8246.36,of your body.
8247.36,So a lot of the side
effects,"of finasteride,"
8249.719,which is loss of sensation
and,"loss of erectile function,"
8253.65,have to do with
the,disconcordance
8257.49,between the sensitivity of
the,genital skin and the skin.
8260.677,ANDREW HUBERMAN:
"Again,",another reason
8262.26,to not disrupt
5-alpha,reductase.
8264.45,And we'll definitely get you
back,on here to talk about--
8266.873,I think we should just do
a,"whole episode about DHT,"
8269.04,because so often when
people,are thinking
8270.748,"about optimizing hormones,"
especially,males trying
8274.033,"to optimize their hormones,"
they're,"thinking testosterone,"
8276.45,testosterone.
8276.99,"Maybe nowadays, they"
think,a little bit more
8278.4,about free testosterone and
maybe,they think about estrogen
8280.959,as also being important--
not,to crush estrogen.
8282.959,"But DHT is, at least to"
my,"mind, the linchpin"
8286.83,of so many of the things that
subjectively,people are really
8289.41,"focused on-- libido,"
"motivation,","drive, et cetera."
8292.876,I have one final question--
it's,"just a brief one,"
8294.959,but many of us have heard
that,the BPAs that are present
8298.139,in plastic bottles and even
in,certain aluminum cans
8301.5,and phthalates-- a
difficult,"word to pronounce,"
8304.32,but a fun one
nonetheless--,phthalates--
8306.78,and work by Dr. Shanna Swan has
shown,that phthalate exposure
8311.01,to the fetus--
8312.12,to pregnant mothers and
to,fetuses very likely
8314.73,is negatively impacting sperm
"counts,","testosterone levels,"
8317.639,and even changing genitalia
size,for the worse in males
8322.35,nowadays.
8324.299,I saw a beautiful lecture that
Dr.,Shanna Swan did on this
8327.48,when I was in Copenhagen.
And,it's very clear
8329.462,that it's negatively
impacting,the male fetus.
8331.379,She was also on Joe
Rogan's,podcast.
8333.03,I hope to get her
on,this podcast.
8334.83,"However, what she"
couldn't,answer
8337.139,for me was whether or
not,"phthalates, and BPAs,"
8339.738,and these things
present,"in plastics,"
8341.28,and some people
claim,"in tap water,"
8343.469,are bad for males after
they're,born and after puberty.
8348.299,What are your thoughts on--
8350.04,"or I should just ask you,"
do,you drink water out
8352.049,of plastic bottles?
8353.07,Do you avoid drinking out of
cans,that are not specifically
8357.66,non-BPA containing cans?
8360.12,And do you actively
avoid,phthalates?
8362.01,My understanding
is,that phthalates
8363.12,are most enriched in
"pesticides,",and that's
8365.25,why you're seeing dramatic
drops,in sperm and testosterone
8368.639,levels mainly in rural areas
where,they're dust cropping.
8371.597,KYLE GILLETT: Yeah.
8372.389,So I do avoid drinking out
of,cans that-- or plastics
8375.99,that may have BPA or
bisphenol,A in them.
8380.219,Bisphenol A is known
to,bind to what
8383.91,I would consider the
fifth,"estrogen receptor,"
8385.95,estrogen-related receptor gamma.
8389.25,So it I would consider
it,a xenoestrogen.
8392.88,So phytoestrogens are estrogens
from,"plants, and in general,"
8395.638,they're not concerning or
clinically,significant.
8397.68,And xenoestrogens are
just,other estrogens.
8401.02,So I do avoid BPA and
I,also test my water.
8405.63,I use a water testing
service,and I test it both
8408.66,after it's through my water
filter,and the tap water
8412.83,that my two boys drink
almost,every day.
8415.89,And it's very interesting.
8417.12,I only found one
microplastic,just a bit
8419.7,"over the reference range, so"
it,wasn't a terrible tap score.
8423.42,"But even in developed countries,"
these,are widely variable.
8427.2,"As far as phthalates,"
"again,",very
8431.16,difficult and
interesting,"to pronounce,"
8433.5,but I remember
learning,about these
8435.51,because there is I
believe,a lawsuit that
8438.21,had to do with mac and cheese.
8440.35,And this was probably
five,"years ago,"
8443.95,and I was coming up
with,my list of--
8447.15,each provider that
does,obstetrics
8449.01,has a list what to avoid
for,the pregnant lady.
8452.01,Sketchy deli meats
or,high mercury fish
8455.342,like swordfish and
"salmon,",and I actually
8457.05,added processed mac and
cheese,to that list.
8459.892,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.
8461.1,"Well, thank you for that."
8462.142,I'm going to extract
your,statement
8463.92,that you avoid drinking out of
plastic,bottles when possible.
8466.98,I'm guessing you're not
neurotically,attached to that.
8469.23,"If you were dying of thirst,"
you,might crack a plastic bottle
8471.84,of water to survive.
8472.83,"But listen, Kyle--"
8476.61,Dr. Gillett-- thank you so much.
8478.74,You gave us an enormous wealth
of,"knowledge, everything"
8481.5,"from behaviors, to psychology,"
to,"supplementation,"
8486.33,to prescription drugs.
8487.84,We will make sure to
point,out where people
8489.93,can get a hold of you on

8492.36,and on other websites in
our,show note captions.
8496.71,"But really, just on"
behalf,of the audience
8499.2,"and just for myself,"
thank,you so much.
8501.355,You have an immense
amount,of knowledge
8502.98,and you're exquisitely good
at,sharing it with people
8505.83,in an actionable way.
