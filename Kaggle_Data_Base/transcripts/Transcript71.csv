0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.36,"where we discuss science, "
3.477,and science-based tools for everyday life. 
9.69,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.63,and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology 
13.39,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.58,"Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Samer Hattar "
18.84,as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast. 
21.64,Dr. Hattar is the Chief of the Section 
23.7,on Light and Circadian Rhythms 
25.62,at the National Institute of Mental Health 
27.59,"in Bethesda, Maryland. "
29.53,Dr. Hattar has many important discoveries to his name. 
33.14,He was one of a handful of groups that discovered 
35.93,the light sensing neurons in the eye 
38.49,that set the circadian clock. 
40.193,This is a fundamental discovery made in the early 
2000s,
44.66,that has led to an enormous number of additional discoveries 
48.17,"on how light regulates our sleep, our immune system, "
52.17,"our mood, mental health, metabolism, feeding, "
56.47,and many other important processes. 
59.41,If ever there was somebody who understands 
61.21,how all of these processes interact 
63.72,"and can inform best practices for our daily behaviors, "
67.64,it's Dr. Hattar. 
69.18,"During our discussion today, Dr. Hattar answers questions "
72.34,that are absolutely essential for us to know 
74.92,about our health and wellbeing. 
76.89,"For instance, how to align our sleep schedule "
80.32,"with our activity schedule, such as exercise, "
82.96,"and how to align light, activity and exercise "
86.75,with our feeding rhythms. 
88.73,"He presents a new model of how light, activity, "
93.09,and feeding rhythms converge to support optimal health. 
96.3,"And when those are not aligned correctly, "
99.25,how our mental and physical health can suffer. 
102.01,"It's a discussion that is rich with scientific mechanism, "
105.27,"made clearly, of course, so everybody can understand, "
108.3,as well as specific protocols to deal with shifts 
111.73,"in day length, shifts in activity, "
114.31,"and in order to optimize sleep, metabolism, "
117.77,and wellbeing of various kinds. 
119.65,I learned so much from Samer as I always do. 
122.28,He is an absolute wealth of knowledge on all things related 
125.66,"to light and circadian rhythms, "
127.34,"physiology, and neuroscience. "
129.36,I don't think you'll find anyone else 
130.77,as knowledgeable about these topics as Samer. 
133.08,"And so, I'm delighted that he joined us here on the podcast "
135.93,to share this information. 
137.5,Before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast 
139.94,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
142.76,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
144.78,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
147.347,and science related tools to the general public. 
150.04,"In keeping with that theme, "
151.02,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
154.15,Our first sponsor is ROKA. 
156.13,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses 
158.16,that are of the absolute highest quality. 
160.48,I've spent my career working on the science 
162.21,of the visual system and I can tell you 
164.22,that one of the things that our visual system 
165.56,has to contend with is adjusting so that when we go 
168.73,"from a very bright area to a dim or shadowed area, "
171.3,we can still see things clearly. 
173.33,ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed 
175.57,with the science of the visual system in mind. 
177.36,And so they make those transitions seamless. 
179.13,You always see things with crystal clarity. 
181.37,Another great thing about these glasses 
182.78,"is that they're very lightweight, "
183.93,so you don't even really remember that they're on your face. 
186.2,And they won't slip off if you get sweaty. 
189.89,The glasses were designed initially for running 
192.78,"and for cycling and for active wear, "
195.1,"but they work great for that and they work great, "
197.87,"and they also happen to look great for work, "
201.17,"if you go out to dinner, for social settings, "
202.81,so they can really be worn in essentially any circumstances. 
206.0,"If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, "
207.49,"you can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A.com "
210.44,"and enter the code ""Huberman"" to get "
20%,off 
212.84,your first order. 
213.673,"That's ROKA.com, enter the code ""Huberman"" at checkout. "
216.86,Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
219.904,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
222.34,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
224.91,to help you better understand your body 
226.66,and help you reach your health goals. 
228.7,I've long been a believer in getting blood work done 
231.71,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
234.07,that impact our immediate and long-term health 
236.27,can only be detected in a quality blood test. 
239.74,"The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, "
241.83,"is you get numbers back, but you don't know what to do "
243.74,about those numbers specifically. 
245.57,ROKA has solved that problem at a number of levels. 
247.89,"First of all, they make getting the blood tests very easy. "
250.53,"They'll come to your house if you like, "
251.38,or you can go to a local clinic. 
253.0,"Second of all, once you get your numbers back, "
256.1,there's a very easy to use dashboard where you can identify 
260.22,"obviously what the numbers are, "
261.41,but also the various things that you can do 
262.85,to bring those numbers into the ranges that you want; 
265.73,"through either behavioral practices like exercise, "
268.59,"through nutritional practices or supplementation, et cetera. "
271.49,"So they made the whole thing very easy start to finish, "
274.26,in a way that allows you to best direct your health goals. 
277.67,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "

286.84,Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon. 
289.81,"Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free, "
292.53,keto-friendly cereal. 
294.41,"I am not ketogenic, "
296.23,meaning I don't follow a purely ketogenic diet. 
298.61,"I tend to fast in the early part of the day, "
300.83,I tend to eat kind of low carbish 
302.6,through the middle of the day. 
304.1,And then in the evening I eat carbohydrates. 
305.83,"That's what works best for me, "
307.42,"and allows me to feel alert all day long, "
309.33,and to sleep really well at night. 
311.85,Magic Spoon is a terrific snack for me 
313.94,"because it tastes terrific; it's got some sweetness, "
316.73,but it doesn't take me out of that state that I want to be in 
319.51,"during the day where I'm sort of ketoish, I would say. "
322.05,"I'm not actually in ketosis, "
323.64,but I'm following more or less a low carb diet 
325.86,"during the day, which keeps me alert. "
327.7,"So either fasting or low carb, "
328.93,and Magic Spoon is consistent with that. 
331.1,"And then as I mentioned before in the evening, "
332.81,I do eat carbohydrates. 
334.9,"Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar, "
337.37,
13,to 
14,"grams of protein, "
339.07,and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving. 
341.89,So I think it qualifies as low carbish or low carb. 
345.7,"In addition, it only has "
140,calories per serving. 
348.11,It's also just delicious. 
349.39,"They have flavors like cocoa, fruity, "
351.68,"peanut butter, frosted. "
353.2,I particularly liked the frosted one 
354.64,"because it tastes like donuts, "
355.75,and I particularly like donuts. 
357.2,Although I try not to eat them too often if ever. 
359.96,"If you want to try Magic Spoon, "
361.48,you can go to MagicSpoon.com/Huberman 
364.4,to grab a variety pack. 
365.56,"You can use the promo code ""Huberman"" at checkout, "
368.17,and you'll get $
5,off your order. 
370.08,"Again, that's MagicSpoon.com/Huberman, "
373.27,"and use the code ""Huberman"" to get $"
5,off. 
376.0,"And now, my conversation with Dr. Samer Hattar. "
379.69,"Samer, thanks for sitting down with me. "
382.28,"- My pleasure. - Yeah, we go way back. "
385.68,"So, you are best known in scientific circles "
388.79,"for your work on how light impacts mood, learning, feeding, "
394.29,"hunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics. "
397.09,"So, just to kick the ball out onto the field, so to speak, "
402.81,how does light impact the way we feel? 
405.64,"So, when I get up in the morning, "
407.78,I have the opportunity to interact with light 
409.79,in certain ways or to avoid light in certain ways. 
412.25,I have the opportunity to interact with sunlight 
414.15,or with artificial light. 
416.04,Maybe you could just wade us into what the relationship is 
420.61,between light and these things 
422.67,"like mood and hunger, et cetera. "
424.12,- Sure. 
425.25,"So, I mean, you do appreciate the effect "
428.06,of light for vision. 
429.13,"So, when you wake up in a beautiful area, "
432.3,"beautiful ocean, light is essential; "
435.29,"the sunrise, the sunset, blue sky, beautiful mountains. "
440.16,"So, that's your conscious perception of light, "
443.18,but light has a completely different aspect 
445.75,that is independent of conscious vision 
448.41,or image forming functions. 
450.4,And that's how it regulates many important 
453.42,functions in your body. 
454.71,I think the best that is well studied and well known 
457.98,is your circadian clock. 
460.02,"And the word circadian comes from the word circa, "
462.71,which is approximate and diem is day. 
465.25,"So, it's an approximate day. "
466.62,Why is it an approximate day? 
468.56,Because if I put you or any other human being 
471.15,who have a normal circadian clock in a constant conditions 
474.96,"with no information about feeding time, about sleep time, "
478.94,"about what time it is outside, "
481.13,"you still have a daily rhythm, "
482.92,but it's not exactly 
24,hours. 
484.86,So it will shift out of the solar day 
488.05,because it's not exactly 
24,"hours, "
489.88,and hence the name circadian. 
491.38,"- So, just to ask a quick question about that. "
493.44,When you say you have this about 
24,"hour rhythm, "
497.76,how does that rhythm show up in the tissues of our body? 
502.102,- Great question. 
502.935,"So, it shows up at every level that we know we studied; "
506.22,it shows up at the level of the cell. 
508.46,"It shows up at the level of the tissue, "
510.31,and it shows up at your behavior. 
512.13,The most obvious for you is your sleep-wake cycle. 
515.35,You sleep and you're awake and sleep at the 
24,hour rhythms. 
519.68,And if you measure the sleep-wake cycle of humans 
522.33,"who are maintaining constant conditions, "
524.56,you will see that the period length of the sleep rhythm 
527.04,on average is more than 
24,hours. 
529.64,In humans it's 
24.2,hours. 
531.86,So you'll be drifting .
2,hours every day 
535.24,out of the solar day if you don't get the sunlight. 
537.55,So the sunlight adjusts that approximate day 
541.42,"to an exact day, so now your behavior is adjusted "
545.06,to the light-dark environment or the solar day. 
548.04,"- Okay, so if I understand correctly, "
549.64,if I were to go into a cave- 
551.39,- Yeah. - Or I would to be 
552.3,in constant light. - Yeah. 
554.06,- And I didn't close my eyes- - Yeah. 
555.94,"- In constant light, that I would still sleep "
559.08,in one coherent about. - Yes. 
561.387,- And I would still be awake for more or less one 
563.53,"coherent about, maybe a nap. - Yes. "
565.55,"- But the total duration of my day, so to speak, "
571.33,would be a little bit longer than 
24,hours? 
574.39,- Perfect. - But if I'm in a condition 
576.94,like most people are where the sun goes up 
578.657,"and the sun goes down, and I have some understanding "
581.31,"of that sunrise and sunset, then- "
583.287,"- You don't have the understanding, "
584.18,you don't have to have conscious understanding. 
586.62,You have the detection. - Right. 
588.247,"- So, circadian photoentrainment is the word we use, "
591.7,entraining the circadian clock to the photic environment 
595.3,is completely subconscious. 
596.96,You're not aware of it. 
598.14,"It's not like vision or image forming, "
600.82,where you actually know what you're looking at. 
602.9,"So, it's all hypothalamic. "
605.43,It's part of the brain that is not consciously driven. 
608.58,"So, you actually do not know when it happens "
610.78,or when it doesn't happen. 
611.75,And that's what we'll get into when I tell you 
614.18,why light affects your mood and why sometimes people 
616.75,don't know how to deal with light 
618.21,"to improve their mood, for example. "
620.28,"- Okay, so this is a subconscious vision. "
622.37,- Yes. - Okay. 
624.48,"Before you tell us about how light impacts mood, "
626.68,"I'm curious, what is the relevance of adjusting this clock "
631.54,from a little bit longer than 
24,hours to 
24,hours? 
635.07,"I mean, it seems like a small difference, "
636.49,
24,hours and 
40,minutes or 
24,hours. 
640.04,Like what's the relevance? 
642.47,"I mean, why should we care about that short difference? "
644.43,"- So, let's do the math. "
645.44,If you shift out .
2,"hours a day, "
647.59,in five days you're shifting out one hour. 
649.56,So you're literally one hour off 
652.18,in your social behavior in five days. 
654.53,In 
10,"days, you're two hours off. "
656.59,"And if you're an organism that is living in the wild, "
659.62,"shifting out of the right phase of the cycle, "
662.14,you could either miss food or you could become food. 
664.95,So it's really essential for survival. 
667.07,I think it's one of the strongest aspect of survival 
670.63,for animals to have the anticipation 
673.71,and the adjustment to the solar cycle. 
676.49,- And for humans as well. 
677.97,"When you say animals, I'm assuming that applies to us? "
680.08,"- Absolutely, yeah. - I see. "
681.8,So even though it's just a short bit longer than 
"24,",
686.79,"if that accumulates over days, "
688.35,then you could find yourself very much out of phase 
690.92,with the rest of your species essentially. 
693.466,"- Yeah, so let's say it's ."
2,hours. 
695.44,"So, in five days it's one hour. "
697.85,In 
25,days it could be five or six hours. 
701.44,You could be in New York and you're feeling 
703.3,as if you traveled from New York to London. 
705.2,"So, you would be having jet lag in New York, "
708.38,even though you didn't do a jet lag travel. 
710.79,So it's very important for the adjustment. 
713.68,"And if we have time, maybe we could talk about "
715.95,"why this is important for seasonality, "
717.99,because also it allows animals to anticipate 
720.66,the change in season. 
722.31,"And the more you're high in the north or the south, "
726.35,"the more that these weather changes occur very harshly, "
730.25,and you have to be ready for them. 
732.13,And that happens in us as well. 
735.11,"- All right, well, we will definitely get into seasonality. "
737.91,"Okay, so we've got this subconscious vision "
740.59,that aligns us with the turn of the earth. 
744.49,How does that work? 
746.744,What is the machinery that allows that to happen? 
751.09,And how does that machinery work? 
753.93,"- Yeah, so, we knew that in mammals, including us, "
757.02,"we are mammals, humans, "
758.58,that the eyes are required for this function. 
760.55,"So, if humans are born without eyes, "
763.34,"or the optic nerves are damaged, "
765.27,humans are not able to adjust to the solar cycle. 
768.84,So we know that the eyes are required. 
771.1,And since we thought we knew about the eyes a lot 
773.84,before 
"2000,",we thought that- 
775.697,- You say before the year 
2000?,
777.56,- Before the year 
"2000,","yes. - Mm hm, yep. "
779.05,- We thought it's these photoreceptors in your retina 
782.7,that allow you to see. 
783.69,"So, in the human retinas, "
785.65,there are two types of photoreceptors; 
788.16,they are called rods and cones because of their shapes. 
791.4,"And these rods and cones simply take the photon energy, "
794.39,"which light is made of, "
796.08,and they change it in a way to an electrical signal 
798.67,that allow us to build the image of the environment 
802.4,in our cortices. - Subconsciously? 
804.55,"- Consciously in this situation cause it's vision, right? "
806.98,"It's image forming vision, it's a visual cortex, "
810.26,"and associative cortices, which allow you to build "
813.47,conscious perception of the environment. 
816.34,"However, people have found, including me with the work "
820.43,"of David Berson and Ignacio Provencio, "
822.52,that there is a subset of ganglion cells. 
825.56,"The ganglion cells are the cells that leave the retina, "
828.8,their axon leave the retina and project to the brain. 
831.76,So these were thought to only relay rod and cone information 
835.7,from the light environment to the brain. 
838.08,We found that a small subset of these ganglion cells 
841.52,are themselves photoreceptors that were completely 
844.27,missed in the retina. 
846.02,And these are the photoreceptors 
848.1,that relay light environment subconsciously 
852.09,to the areas in the brain that have and house 
855.02,"the circadian clock or the circadian pacemaker, "
858.1,which adjusts all the clocks in our bodies 
860.55,to the central brain clock that allows them to entrain 
863.84,to the 
24,hour light-dark cycle. 
867.45,- Incredible. 
868.283,"So, as I recall 'cause I was a graduate student at the time, "
871.56,in the year 
"2000,",there was this landmark discovery 
874.46,"made by you, Ignacio Provencio, David Berson, and others, "
878.0,that these cells exists that can communicate 
880.35,day and night information to the brain. 
882.21,- Yeah. - In this very small 
883.56,subset of cells. 
885.46,"Since then, I've heard, but maybe you can confirm or refute "
889.24,that this system that connects the eyes 
892.95,to the rest of the brain is actually the most 
895.23,ancient form of vision. 
896.34,That this is probably the form of vision that some early 
900.07,"version of human beings had before they had pattern vision, "
903.11,before they could see colors and shapes 
904.69,and motion and all that. 
906.45,And that the same cells that perform this role 
911.39,are actually similar to insect eyes. 
914.87,I think I heard David Berson say once that we actually 
916.99,have a little bit of the fly eye in our eye. 
919.88,What's he talking about? - Yeah. 
921.31,"So, it's really interesting actually, "
923.5,because these same ipRCGs we discovered they contribute 
928.11,a little bit to image formation. 
929.56,"And now, work from Tiffany Schmidt specifically have proven "
933.01,that they do contribute to image forming functions. 
936.3,But they contribute to very limited 
940.72,aspect of image formation. 
942.01,"So, it fits your hypothesis that these "
944.26,are an ancient photoreceptors. 
945.84,The other thing that adds to that hypothesis 
948.69,is that they are expressed in cells that don't have 
950.95,any modification that make them look like photoreceptors. 
954.14,"So, the photoreceptors that I told you about "
956.34,"that are important for vision, image formation, "
959.83,they have very specialized structures that allow them 
963.134,to pack these structures with photopigments; 
965.82,"these are the photo-detecting proteins, "
969.08,so they could detect a high sensitivity of photons 
972.16,that pass through them. 
975.15,These new photoreceptors don't have 
978.06,these specialized structures. 
980.41,"So they just really need a lot of light at the time, "
984.45,we thought they need a lot of light to be activated. 
988.1,So that's why we think they are ancient. 
990.09,And that's why we think they adjust to ancient functions 
993.223,that are as important as regulating 
995.75,"your body circadian clock to the solar environment, "
999.32,to solar day or to the light-dark cycle. 
1002.21,"- So, you mentioned ipRCGs, intrinsically photosensitive. "
1005.3,So these are cells that connect the eye of the brain 
1007.08,that behave like photoreceptors. 
1008.41,- Right. - Essentially. 
1009.32,"And then you mentioned melanopsin, "
1011.73,which is the actual pigment that converts the light 
1014.59,into the electrical signal- - Yeah. 
1016.0,- More or less. 
1017.57,And my understanding is that melanopsin was identified first 
1021.8,in frog melanophores. - Yes. 
1024.18,- So does that mean that we have like little pieces 
1026.12,of frog skin in our eyes? 
1028.05,"- So, honestly, David Berson say you have a fly in your eye "
1030.98,because it sounds better. 
1032.5,The more accurate I think is that you have 
1034.813,a frog skin in your eye. 
1036.07,"It's not as catchy, but really, "
1040.0,"the name melanopsin is from melanocyte opsin, "
1043.26,so it's melanopsin because it was found 
1045.41,in the frog melanocytes. 
1046.73,You know the frogs can change their color depending on light 
1050.32,and melanopsin drives this response. 
1052.73,So when Ignacio Provencio first discovered 
1055.98,"these opsins in frogs, "
1057.81,luckily he was smart enough to see if they are expressed 
1060.29,in the frog eye. 
1061.74,They were expressed in the frog eye and it what appears 
1064.29,"to be retinal ganglion cells, which I told you, "
1066.5,the one that connects the eye to the brain. 
1068.49,He had the insight to go and see 
1070.34,if they are expressed in the monkey eye. 
1072.6,And he found that they are also expressed in what appears 
1075.14,"to be retinal ganglion cells, "
1076.77,and really that what opened the field wide open. 
1079.48,Then David Berson did the seminal experiment 
1082.92,"where he went to the brain where the central oscillator, "
1087.47,the oscillator that drives circadian rhythm in the brain 
1089.85,"called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, "
1091.84,that has been known for many years to receive retinal input. 
1095.81,And he labeled the cells that project there. 
1098.34,"And then he found that even if you destroy rods and cones, "
1101.32,you could get light responses from these cells. 
1103.57,So you could imagine he nearly fainted when he saw 
1107.0,"that these cells can respond independent, "
1109.74,completely in the absence of rod and cone input. 
1112.73,"- Yeah, I'll never forget reading "
1113.79,those papers in 
"2000,",
2001.,
1116.86,"I was at the meeting in DC when Ignacio, "
1120.309,"Iggy, we call him Iggy, "
1121.59,showed this image of this basically 
1124.1,what is frog melanophores 
1126.05,in the human eye. - Yes. 
1127.31,"- [Andrew] And everyone was like, "
1128.143,"""oh my goodness, this is the thing."" "
1129.22,- Yeah. 
1130.73,- And I want to get into how light 
1132.66,actually can control circadian rhythms. 
1134.42,In a moment. - Absolutely. 
1135.253,- But I think it's worth mentioning now that people 
1138.45,"who are pattern vision blind, "
1140.16,"so people who cannot see and no conscious vision, "
1144.0,"but have eyes, many of them still have these cells; "
1147.65,"these melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive cells, "
1150.12,"and can essentially match or entrain, as we say, "
1154.29,onto the light-dark cycle. 
1156.04,"- In fact, they possibly have no problems "
1158.06,"in circadian photoentrainment, "
1159.43,they'll have a normal sleep-wake cycle. 
1161.6,- But they're totally blind? 
1162.62,- But they are totally image blind. 
1164.17,"And what's really interesting is that, "
1166.66,"and this story I heard from Chuck Czeisler, "
1168.52,"so I'll give him credit, "
1169.86,"that some of these people who are image blind, "
1172.24,usually they get dry eyes and they give them a lot of pain. 
1175.65,"And doctors used to think, oh, since they are image blind "
1179.3,"and they're getting dry eye, "
1180.133,why don't you just remove their eyes? 
1182.11,They're not using them anymore. 
1183.67,"And the minute they would remove their eyes, "
1186.01,they start having cyclical sleep problems indicating 
1188.86,that now they are not entraining to the light-dark cycle 
1192.3,and are having cyclical jet lags when their clock shifts 
1196.27,through the light-dark cycle. 
1198.02,- That's really interesting. 
1198.97,And I hear from a number of blind people 
1202.54,"in my various aspects of my job, "
1204.59,and a lot of them have issues with sleep. 
1207.49,"I think, in part because they don't realize that they too "
1210.73,need to see light at particular times of day or night 
1213.18,in order to match their schedule. 
1215.36,"- Absolutely. - Well, I think "
1216.27,that's a perfect segue for us to talk about how light 
1220.91,and viewing light can impact our sleep-wake rhythms. 
1224.58,And then we'll move into some of the other ways in which 
1227.44,light can impact other forms of bodily function. 
1230.38,"- Yeah, so I love the way you set it up "
1233.27,because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect 
1237.27,of trying to educate people about light effect 
1240.52,on subconscious vision is that it's subconscious. 
1243.79,So we're all aware of what we think is intensity 
1247.21,"because we see the room, but if you talk to people "
1250.3,"who know how to take photographs and stuff like that, "
1253.55,they know that the intensities varies greatly. 
1256.14,"But our system, because we have to see the same way "
1259.1,"in very bright conditions and very dim conditions, "
1262.15,we're not very good at estimating intensity consciously. 
1266.09,"So when you try to tell people about intensity, "
1268.45,"you really struggle because they think they know intensity, "
1271.58,but they really don't. 
1272.71,- You mean light intensity? - Light intensity. 
1274.62,- Yeah. - So the cones themselves 
1277.22,have an incredible ability to adapt 
1279.56,to different light conditions. 
1281.47,So you can see at all different conditions. 
1283.52,Otherwise it'd be a disaster. 
1285.18,If you don't change the setting on your camera 
1287.99,"and you go from inside the room to the outside, "
1290.03,"it becomes completely white, you don't see anything. "
1292.64,"So if your cones don't adapt to the environment, "
1295.99,then you're not going to be able to see in this room 
1298.58,"and on the beach, right? "
1300.98,"But the problem is your ipRCGs, "
1304.21,"the cells that we talked about, "
1306.41,they measure intensity pretty well. 
1308.58,They really know what intensity is. 
1310.38,They have a very good linear measurement of intensity. 
1313.25,They don't adapt as well. 
1314.9,"They don't adapt actually that much, to be honest. "
1318.47,So that tells you that subconsciously the system is used 
1323.33,"to measuring light intensity in a natural environment, "
1326.54,"because when you are now in the natural environment, "
1328.86,"you don't have industrialized lighting, "
1332.12,then your system is functioning very well. 
1335.53,"But now when we change these environments, "
1338.14,we could really mess up ourselves. 
1339.66,So you have to teach people how to understand intensity. 
1343.44,And that's something that you have to explain to people. 
1345.91,And I think I love to do it myself. 
1347.96,I do it in what is called the lowest amount of light 
1351.24,required to allow you to see comfortably. 
1353.5,So you have to do this as an fun experiment. 
1356.45,"- Okay, so explain to me how this goes. "
1358.75,And maybe we could break up the day 
1360.58,into three or four parts. 
1362.88,So let's say assuming that most people wake up 
1365.75,in the morning- - Mm hm. 
1366.62,"- As opposed to night shift workers, et cetera, "
1368.55,we could talk about later. - Right. 
1369.877,"- But they wake up in the morning, "
1371.5,so let's divide the day into quarters. 
1373.751,What is the proper way to interact with light 
1377.05,in the first part of the day? 
1379.3,"- So, I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up, "
1382.88,get as much light as you can. 
1385.52,"- To your eyes? - Yeah, it's really nice. "
1387.5,Your system is prime. 
1388.84,"If you're entrained, it's prime to get light, "
1390.92,the sun should be out. 
1392.68,"Most animals in the wild, "
1394.06,they actually seem to track the sun. 
1396.32,The sun has a huge influence on life on earth. 
1398.76,It's actually life on earth is because of sun. 
1401.9,"So, that's easy. "
1404.07,"In the morning when you wake up, you need light. "
1406.143,"Just get the light. - Okay, so what is "
1407.02,the behavioral practice that you recommend? 
1410.5,Let's say somebody is in a condition where 
1412.34,there's a lot of cloud cover. - Yeah. 
1413.287,- Is it important to get outside? 
1415.65,"- So, I have to tell you, "
1416.82,the cloudiest day is going to be much more brighter 
1419.43,than your room. 
1420.263,You could ask any photographer. 
1422.41,"A cloudy day, unless it's really dark, dark clouds, "
1425.5,usually cloudy days have much more light outside 
1428.85,"than inside the room, "
1429.87,even when you have good lighting inside the room. 
1432.78,"So I think in the outside is usually even when it's cloudy, "
1436.999,you're going to get to enough intensity to help you adjust 
1439.75,your cycle to the day-night cycle. 
1441.8,"- So, how long do you... "
1443.91,"These are general rules of thumb, "
1445.06,but how long do you recommend people go outside? 
1446.553,"- So, if you do it daily, you possibly need very few. "
1449.97,"If you do it daily, because remember this thing "
1452.06,is going to happen on a daily matter. 
1453.547,"So, let's say "
15,"minutes. - So, the clock is tracking "
1455.43,it on a regular basis? - Absolutely. 
1456.81,"It's photon counting, it's tracking. "
1459.62,I would say 
15,minutes. 
1460.71,"If you don't do it daily, you may want to increase it. "
1463.66,"And we'll talk about when you travel, what you could do, "
1465.74,"but yeah, "
15,minutes should be fine. 
1468.02,"You do it more, it doesn't hurt. "
1469.87,"- And through a window, "
1471.41,"my understanding is that through a window, "
1473.21,it dramatically decreases the amount of light energy 
1475.47,coming in. - It depends on how thick 
1478.28,the windows are and how dark they are. 
1480.23,"So, but it's also nice to go outside "
1482.58,and to feel the seasons. 
1484.49,- Sunglasses off? 
1486.09,- I don't use sunglasses. 
1487.58,"- Yeah, but you have your Jordanian photopigment. "
1490.1,"- Yeah, yeah, that's right. - You know, so, yeah. "
1492.23,"Whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right? "
1494.38,"- No, but I personally, if I'm in the shade "
1498.24,"or if it's not incredibly bright, "
1500.24,"I try to, especially in the morning, "
1501.567,but I'm also an early person. 
1503.63,So we have to differentiate between early- 
1504.813,- What time do you wake up? 
1506.27,- I wake up at 
4:,
30,in the morning. 
1507.553,"- But the sun isn't out yet. - It's not out yet, so it's- "
1510.22,"- So, what do you do? "
1511.053,You turn on artificial lights? 
1512.16,- I usually don't turn on artificial light 
1514.21,"because I know the sun is going to come up eventually, "
1516.56,but that's why I don't like the change 
1519.0,in the timing that they do. 
1521.123,"- Wait, but what do you do between "
4:,
30,a.m. and 
7:,
00,a.m.? 
1523.79,"- I mean, I look at my computer, "
1525.53,"and my phone. - Oh, I see. "
1526.363,"- So possibly I get enough light, "
1528.005,"but in reality, I mean as long as you let your body "
1532.03,"get the morning sunlight, which I think is really, "
1535.86,"to me and there is no evidence of this, "
1537.69,"but to me, if you look at all animals, plants, "
1540.9,this morning sunlight seems to be very important. 
1543.66,"And we don't have experiments to show it, "
1547.43,but I have a gut feeling that it 
1549.29,has a huge impact on humans. 
1551.71,"- Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab at the Stanford Sleep Lab "
1554.44,has shown that these early morning light flashes 
1557.16,can adjust the total amount of sleep- 
1558.68,- Absolutely. - That one will get. 
1560.29,It makes it easier to get into sleep. 
1561.462,"- Absolutely, absolutely. "
1563.57,And Ken Wright also did this beautiful camping experiments 
1568.27,that showed that- - Maybe you could describe 
1570.421,those 'cause those are beautiful experiments. 
1571.254,"- Oh, yeah, they are beautiful experiments. "
1573.21,He took these college students that had a late onset 
1577.48,"of sleep and late waking time, "
1579.68,"and then he said, let's go camping and just don't use "
1582.21,any artificial light and you could go to sleep 
1585.15,"as late or as early as you want, "
1587.81,and wake up as late or as early. 
1589.33,And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern 
1593.04,just by exposing them to the light-dark cycle. 
1595.45,"I mean, so- - And it has lasted. "
1597.7,"- And it lasted, yeah. - Even after they came back. "
1599.396,- Exactly. - Those two days of camping 
1600.9,"reset the circadian clock? - Seven days, but it lasted. "
1603.42,"Yeah, it's pretty amazing. "
1604.99,"Yeah, it's really incredible. "
1606.8,"- Okay, so get bright light of some sort early in the day, "
1611.45,"ideally sunlight, even on a cloudy day, it's going to be- "
1613.69,- Absolutely. - Brighter than indoor light. 
1615.74,"- So that's easy. - Okay, so then- "
1617.64,- And the other thing that I would like to mention 
1619.57,"to people, if you think it's very dim outside, "
1622.42,"let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer. "
1624.61,So remember intensity is only one component. 
1627.35,Duration is also important because remember 
1629.39,that the circadian system is not like the image system. 
1633.01,In the image system you have to change every second 
1635.37,because you're looking at different objects. 
1637.02,You have to change your perception. 
1638.843,But for the circadian system it's trying to figure out 
1642.17,where am I in the day-night cycle? 
1644.97,"So the more you give them the information, "
1647.04,the better you are. 
1648.03,"So, if it's very bright, you don't need a lot "
1650.067,because it's clearly going to make you fire like crazy. 
1653.71,"But if it's not bright, stay longer, stay for one hour. "
1656.99,"You know, have your coffee outside or something like that. "
1659.75,It's just going to help. 
1660.833,"- I think you said something extremely important, "
1663.09,which is that this circadian system is trying to figure out 
1666.47,when you are in time. - Exactly. 
1668.67,- Not where you are in space. 
1669.707,"- Sorry, I said, where you are in time. "
1670.887,- Yeah. - I mean when you are. 
1672.58,"- Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you. "
1673.73,I just meant that I think fundamentally that's 
1676.426,the incredible thing about this system. 
1678.91,"- Absolutely. - That you have this clock, "
1681.01,this 
24,"hour clock in your brain, "
1682.84,but it needs to be synchronized to the outside. 
1685.59,So could we go a little deeper into this circadian setting 
1689.81,behavior and come up with some general rules of thumb? 
1693.37,"So, let's say it's a very bright day. "
1694.867,"- Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. "
1697.31,"No clouds, the sun's out. "
1700.98,You said 
10,"minutes, "
15,minutes. 
1702.747,"- And I'll tell you if you're sensitive, "
1705.08,you don't even have to go in the sun. 
1706.76,You could be in the shade. 
1708.16,There's going to be so many photons out there in the shade. 
1711.29,It's going to be perfect. 
1712.33,You don't even have to see the sun. 
1714.4,You don't have to have the sun. 
1715.96,"You know, it's great for vitamin D, "
1717.36,that's a different story. 
1718.32,You could do this for your skin and protect your skin. 
1722.21,"That's not my area of expertise, "
1723.82,"but for that effect on the circadian system, "
1727.77,"as long as you're outside in the shade and it's sunny day, "
1730.72,
10,to 
15,minutes should be ample amount. 
1733.6,- Okay and then let's say it's kind of overcast. 
1738.07,"You know, it's not particularly bright "
1739.36,"or there's solid cloud cover, but obviously the sun is out, "
1742.92,but it's not as bright. 
1745.31,How long do you think it would take to set the clock? 
1747.2,- 
10,to 
15,should be sufficient. 
1749.34,Stay for half an hour. 
1750.52,Stay for 
45,minutes. 
1751.79,"If it's very darker out, stay for longer. "
1754.53,"- Okay and if for some reason, "
1756.4,"one finds themselves very far north, "
1758.58,"and it's very, very dense a cloud cover. "
1762.6,How long and at what point should somebody consider 
1766.01,using an artificial light source to mimic the sunlight? 
1770.21,"- Yeah, honestly, this is where we don't have "
1772.57,"a lot of information still, because this is where "
1775.88,"we're going to discuss this maybe in more detail, "
1778.23,"that if you put humans in artificial conditions, "
1782.06,"the circadian system is very sensitive to light, "
1785.59,"but in reality, in the real environment, "
1788.86,light also is affecting other aspects that are independent 
1792.62,of the setting of the circadian pacemaker. 
1795.3,- Okay. - And these which we call 
1796.8,"the direct effect of light on mood, for example. "
1799.96,"So, that is very hard to figure out "
1802.16,what intensity you need to use. 
1803.76,And we haven't done enough experiments 
1804.937,'cause this system has been discovered just recently. 
1808.95,"But I would say if you use bright light in the morning, "
1811.71,"and I mean, it's hard for me to give numbers. "
1814.7,It can get complicated. 
1818.12,"But yeah, I mean, honestly, if you're that far north "
1821.51,"and you're in the winter and you make sure you don't, "
1824.37,use these light boxes. 
1825.61,"I would suggest that personally, but that's it. "
1828.81,"- I use, it's actually not designed for circadian setting, "
1831.75,but I have a 
930,lux light pad that I bought 
1835.99,"and I bought it, they're very affordable compared "
1838.41,to the dawn simulating lights. 
1840.52,"- Yeah, you don't need them. "
1841.353,"- Which are quite expensive, frankly. "
1843.34,- Yeah. - And I put it there. 
1844.79,"And so, just basically, when I wake up in the morning, "
1847.05,"I use that until the sun comes out, "
1848.85,"and then I make sure once the sun is out, I go outside. "
1851.23,But I keep that thing on all day. 
1853.33,And I don't know if that's good or bad. 
1855.13,Is a good or bad? 
1855.963,"- I, honestly, I don't think being exposed to bright light "
1859.4,in the day is going to ever be bad because really 
1861.73,if you're outside in the day... 
1863.8,"Unless, you know, the worst that's going to happen "
1866.11,"if the temperature is very high, "
1867.7,your body's going to say don't dehydrate and go to sleep. 
1870.4,"So you could tell actually sometimes when it's very hot, "
1874.0,"the more you get exposed to bright light, "
1875.86,"the sleepier you feel in the afternoon, "
1877.8,which is counter-intuitive. - Mm hm. 
1881.289,"And that's to protect us, you think, against dehydration? "
1883.37,- I think if you think about the human evolution 
1886.07,from near the equator in between noon 
1889.38,"and a certain time in the afternoon, "
1891.59,it would have been very hard for you to maintain 
1894.64,"physiological homeostatic function, "
1896.67,being active at this very high temperature time. 
1899.74,"So I think napping was a way, "
1902.09,that's why I think it has a major function which is still... 
1905.12,Napping was a way to somehow take you away 
1907.81,from that dangerous zone. 
1909.23,"And maybe that's why people in the north they say, "
1912.08,in the winter we can't wake up in the morning 
1914.15,'cause they don't have this long light. 
1915.73,"So, they sleep more at night. "
1917.32,"But in the summer they say, "
1918.4,we feel like we can't go to sleep. 
1920.36,We have to put all these dark curtains. 
1922.95,"So, I think, venturing that much up north has been... "
1928.84,Came up with a problem because evolution was used to 
1931.28,a certain light environment that was completely 
1934.91,changed with a human. 
1936.37,"With other animals, I think that lived there longer, "
1940.22,they have come up with very interesting adaptation 
1942.75,of actually measuring even very small changes 
1946.18,in the light intensities that still occur. 
1949.36,"And so, even if you're near the poles, "
1952.31,"even though it's always light, "
1953.94,but there is a change in the light intensity 
1956.11,across the day-night cycle. 
1957.21,"So, your system, if it's linear, "
1959.06,"and remember I told you that ipRCGs are incredibly linear, "
1962.87,"can still measure, oh, this is lower light than higher light "
1966.529,if the organism has the ability to do that. 
1969.78,"- I see, yeah, it's interesting. "
1971.23,I've spent so much time learning from you 
1974.56,"fortunately about these cells, "
1976.62,and yet I never really appreciated until now 
1979.09,how on the one hand they are tracking the amount of light 
1983.19,to understand when we are in time 
1985.47,relative to the 
24,"hour cycle, "
1987.86,but also that you keep mentioning this 
1990.21,linear measurement of intensity; 
1991.9,that they really are trying to figure out 
1993.9,when we are in time by measuring the intensity of light. 
1996.307,And of course the sun is the most intense source 
1999.0,of light available to us. 
2001.05,"So, okay, so I think we've nailed down "
2004.22,that first part of the day. - Exactly. 
2005.97,- Basically it's get 
10,to 
30,minutes 
2007.63,"depending on how bright it is, "
2009.05,and try and do that as often as possible to give the system 
2012.22,a regular source- - Daily is the best. 
2013.283,"This system is really about, "
2016.13,"and you'll see that even for the effect on depression, "
2018.49,it's about multiple days it is. 
2020.61,"So you don't have to worry if you missed it one day, "
2023.61,stay longer if you want. 
2025.17,"But if you're in a hurry and you want to do other stuff, "
2028.17,that's a great recommendation. 
2029.36,"- Mm hm, so you might want to compensate with some extra time "
2032.02,if you missed a day or two. - Absolutely. 
2033.77,"- And this is why I've heard you say before, "
2035.92,it's entirely possible to get severely jet lagged 
2038.97,without traveling. - Absolutely. 
2040.77,"- Simply by staying in, being on your phone too much, "
2043.04,not getting the sunlight. - Absolutely. 
2043.937,And you saw this during the pandemic. 
2046.1,A lot of people mentioned that their 
2047.73,sleep-wake cycles suffered a lot. 
2050.81,Because if you're not going out and if you're staying 
2053.79,at home and you don't have big windows 
2056.42,"and you're waking late, waking up late, "
2058.77,"and then you're using very bright light too late at night, "
2061.56,your body is going to shift. 
2063.21,"And now, your day is going to start instead of like "
2066.38,"really when the sun comes up, "
2067.62,"let's say at six o'clock in the morning, "
2069.99,so your day is going to start at 
11,o'clock in the morning. 
2072.12,That's what your body's going to think 
2073.7,is the beginning of the day. 
2075.82,"So, then you're not going to be able to sleep "
2078.41,at 
10,"o'clock at night, "
2079.74,"because now that's really for your body, "
2083.113,it's completely different timing. 
2085.39,And you could see this happen during the pandemic 
2088.06,at a very high scale. 
2089.81,People get delayed in their sleep-wake cycle a lot. 
2092.72,"- And there is this idea of chronotypes, "
2094.833,that we all each intrinsically have a best rhythm 
2099.15,of either being a morning person. 
2101.093,- Absolutely. - You called yourself 
2101.926,"an early person, or a night owl, "
2103.78,or more of a kind of standard to bed around 
10:,
"30,",
2106.91,up around 
7:,
00,type thing. 
2109.081,"And I think there are now good data, "
2111.3,"correct me if I'm wrong, "
2112.87,from the National Institutes of Mental Health and elsewhere 
2115.09,"showing that the more we deviate from that intrinsic rhythm, "
2119.16,the more mental health issues 
2121.26,and physical health issues start to crop up. 
2123.15,"- So, there is great data on this, "
2124.95,and there is a couple of things that complicate this. 
2127.16,"The first is the people who usually are late, "
2130.53,they tell you that the society doesn't accommodate. 
2133.084,"- By late, what do you mean? "
2134.94,People that wake up late and go to sleep late? 
2136.1,- Go to sleep late and wake up late. 
2138.146,They have an overwhelmingly higher level 
2141.01,of depression and failures. 
2143.51,"I mean, clearly, I mean, "
2144.69,"the reason the people say sleep early, wake up early, "
2148.437,you're better because human notice that people 
2151.57,"who go to sleep early and wake up early, "
2154.31,they do better in life. 
2155.46,They notice that. - They just perform better? 
2157.36,"- They perform, but the question is, "
2158.9,is that intrinsic to the system or is that society 
2162.45,because society start things usually early or late? 
2165.09,That's a hard question to ask- 
2166.04,- We discriminate against late risers. 
2167.94,"- In a way, we discriminate, right? "
2169.64,But the other explanation is Ken Wright's experiment. 
2173.5,"These late riser, if they were truly chronotypically late, "
2178.13,why would they shift so easily when you put them in the... 
2181.73,"If you were really chronotypically late, "
2183.93,and there is a phase relation between 
2186.19,"the light-dark environment and your circadian clock, "
2188.83,then doing this camping experiment should not have caused 
2191.6,much changes because it's not that light is going to affect you 
2197.28,"in a certain way, it's that this is the relationship "
2199.57,"that your body decided that I'm a late sleeper, late waking. "
2203.82,"So, I'm honestly, I'm still unable to figure out "
2208.14,how much of this late waking up is controlled 
2211.03,by the light environment and how much is intrinsic. 
2213.82,"I'm sure there are differences, "
2215.85,but are they as big as we see in the environment? 
2218.58,Because you have people that go off to sleep a 
7:,
00,p.m. 
2222.89,and wake up at 
1:,
00,a.m.. 
2224.13,These are clearly advanced phase- 
2226.21,- So people that go to sleep at 
7:,
00,p.m. 
2228.02,and wake up at 
1:,
00,a.m.? - Yeah. 
2229.4,- And feel good doing that? 
2231.07,"- I'm not so sure they feel good, "
2232.76,"but a lot of the time you talk to people, "
2234.8,"they say they are high achievers, "
2237.06,but they suffer because they go to 
7:,
00,"p.m., "
2240.36,wake up advanced phase sleep syndrome. 
2243.732,"They call it a syndrome, but then you have people "
2247.39,who would not be able to sleep till 
5:,
00,"a.m., "
2249.937,and not be able to wake up till 
3:,
00,"p.m., right? "
2253.6,And I'm not so sure that the circadian system 
2255.92,is that variable in the human population. 
2258.15,"I mean, clearly there are maybe some genetic factors "
2260.76,that make a small percentage of like everything 
2263.87,with the bell shape. 
2265.46,"But I think most of the time, "
2267.15,the light environment may play a role. 
2269.14,"And once, as we've talked about, "
2271.5,this as a long-term effect of light. 
2273.84,"Once you get into a rhythm, and I don't mean it as a pun, "
2277.42,"in reality, once you get into a rhythm, "
2279.44,it's hard to break out of that rhythm because if you start 
2282.78,"sleeping late and waking up late, "
2284.84,you're not getting the morning sunlight. 
2286.8,"- Right. - And so, "
2287.94,you're just going to be late. 
2289.65,"And if you're like me waking up early, "
2291.98,you're getting the morning sunlight. 
2292.907,You're getting what Zeitzer said... 
2296.53,I said his last name wrong. 
2299.46,The one in Stanford who did the- 
2301.06,"- Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer, yeah. "
2303.57,- [Andrew] He actually worked for- 
2305.556,"- Zeitzer, yeah. - Zeitzer. "
2306.389,"So, Zeitzer and Czeisler. - Yeah, it's confusing. "
2307.55,"- Yeah, there are a lot of zz's and i's in their names. "
2310.47,- Yeah. - Both phenomenal scientists. 
2311.93,- Yeah. - What it seems to me 
2314.6,is the case is that the only way to really know 
2318.32,"if you're meant to be an early bird as they call it, "
2321.36,"an early person or a late person, "
2323.53,"or somewhere in between is to get morning sunlight, "
2326.27,and figure out whether or not that makes you feel better. 
2328.26,"- And to understand, "
2331.54,to be educated about how to measure intensity. 
2334.727,"""How to measure"" I put in quotation "
2337.21,"'cause you either get a measuring device, "
2339.77,but you cannot depend on your eye to measure intensity. 
2343.729,"- Okay, so how do we do that? "
2344.562,'Cause you keep coming back to this. 
2346.367,"So, that tells me that it's important. "
2348.186,"- It's very important. - So, obviously, "
2349.26,"so there are apps, free apps like Light Meter, "
2352.86,where you can walk around and hold the button down 
2354.61,and see how many lux are in the environment. 
2358.03,- These are complicated because you have to point them 
2360.09,to specific regions. - Right. 
2361.26,"So, how do people start to develop an intuitive sense "
2365.13,of the measurement of intensity? 
2367.32,"- Yeah, I think at one point I posted on Instagram, "
2370.94,how I keep my nighttime at home. 
2373.57,And I found out that my night vision is very strong. 
2376.96,"So I found out that I, especially in the winter, "
2379.67,I only need candle lights. 
2381.23,"So I literally use these tea lights, "
2383.327,and I put like 
15,or 
20,of them- 
2385.86,- How romantic. - And it's so nice. 
2387.81,I could see it clearly doesn't affect my circadian system. 
2390.743,- You and your cats- - And my wife. 
2393.346,"- And your wife of course. - It's just great, right? "
2395.86,But I don't expect people to have 
2397.31,the same night vision as me. 
2399.42,"So, I mean, I tell people, do the experiment. "
2403.05,"So if you put three or four lights in your room, "
2407.27,"switch two, sit for "
15,minutes. 
2409.68,- Switch two off? - Switch two off. 
2411.23,Let's say you're using five. 
2412.77,"And see, after "
15,"minutes, "
2414.63,you will not recognize you switched these two off. 
2417.4,My gut feeling is that most people would need 
2419.83,at least 
10,times less light than they use at night to see. 
2424.04,The problem people use it 
2425.53,because most of the time they didn't 
2427.21,see the morning sunlight. 
2428.32,They are actually hungry for light without their knowledge. 
2431.1,"So they come switch all these lights on, "
2433.06,but at the wrong time. 
2434.76,Because they woke up late. 
2436.22,"- Okay, now I understand. "
2437.854,"So, this morning light viewing goes way beyond- "
2441.51,"- Absolutely, absolutely. - Setting your clock. "
2443.0,It's also a way to determine how little light 
2446.35,you need later in the day. - Exactly. 
2448.262,"- And we're going to talk about this in a moment, "
2450.17,but how little light you get later in the day 
2453.25,is a very strong determinant of things like 
2455.26,"when you will wake up, "
2456.12,"whether or not you wake up feeling refreshed, et cetera. "
2458.41,"Let's move- - And that's why, "
2460.29,- Yeah? - I'm going to break it 
2461.44,"on your show, Andrew, that I'm going to tell you, "
2464.05,I think there is something else that people 
2466.47,"do need to think about, which is the tripartite model. "
2469.58,That this model incorporate three components 
2472.37,we should talk about in details that allows us humans 
2476.2,"and all animals to incorporate the circadian clock, "
2480.41,"and its relation to light, the homeostatic drive, "
2484.09,"and the direct effect of the environment, "
2486.2,"which includes stress, light, all kinds of stuff. "
2489.21,They have to be incorporated together. 
2491.36,"If you think, that's what I think right now, "
2493.087,"if you think of one alone, you will always miss something. "
2497.848,"And when you think of them as a whole, "
2500.0,things really become clear. 
2501.52,It's actually quite amazing. 
2503.06,"- Okay, well, we will definitely want to hear "
2505.58,about your tripartite theory and go into detail 
2508.73,about those homeostatic mechanisms. 
2510.67,"I want to make sure that for people who are thinking now, "
2514.02,I'm sure about light and how it impacts them. 
2516.91,"So the morning light viewing behavior, "
2518.98,I like to think we've tacked down clearly. 
2521.342,- Absolutely. - And thank you for that 
2522.21,because there's so much information out there 
2523.96,and I've tried to relay that information. 
2526.06,"Of course, you're my primary source "
2527.32,"for all things circadian, as well as Jamie and others, "
2530.74,"of course, and Matt Walker. "
2532.06,"But I think you've made that very, very clear. "
2535.98,"Now, let's say I've gotten my morning sunlight. "
2539.71,"Okay, great. "
2540.543,"Maybe my bright artificial light, "
2541.65,and throughout the day you said to get a lot of light. 
2543.89,"So, I'm working at my desk. "
2545.05,"Maybe I'll go out during the day a few times, "
2547.9,"but I'm working at my computer, I'm doing things. "
2550.55,Is there anything about light viewing 
2552.13,in the middle of the day that people should keep in mind? 
2555.56,Or can they just sort of freestyle it 
2557.69,depending on what they're doing? 
2558.58,Most people are not in a dark room throughout the day- 
2561.99,"- Yeah, so my gut feeling, "
2563.38,"if you've got your morning sunlight, "
2565.57,"you walk from your car slowly or you walk to work, "
2569.74,you didn't wear sunglasses when the lights 
2571.44,"were still dim in the morning, that you could freestyle it. "
2575.04,"That even if you don't get a lot of light, "
2577.47,there is a way to just... 
2580.5,"In the day, you don't have to just worry about "
2582.73,"getting a lot of bright light, "
2583.86,"but personally, I like to do that. "
2585.87,So I go out at lunch and have my lunch outside as well. 
2589.72,This reminds the body that here it is even brighter now. 
2593.61,But the evidence is that you could literally 
2596.67,help your circadian clock by giving lights at dawn and dusk. 
2600.43,"But again, if you think of the tripartite model, "
2602.89,"this may be important for the circadian clock, "
2605.12,but is it important for your mood? 
2607.94,"So that's where I think you need, or the homeostatic drive. "
2611.31,So that's where you need to think about it. 
2613.68,"So, for the clock, for entraining your clock, "
2616.82,you literally can entrain it only by the dawn sunlight. 
2619.85,You actually don't need dawn and dusk. 
2621.91,People usually forget that. 
2622.84,- Yeah and I appreciate that you're distinguishing 
2624.87,between circadian effects and other effects of lights. 
2627.283,"- Yes. - You're being very precise, "
2628.84,which is appreciated. 
2631.63,"Until we hear about this tripartite model, "
2633.68,"which we will cover, for the sake of the discussion, "
2637.35,let's treat the light viewing behavior 
2639.64,as what are the benefits or drawbacks of viewing light 
2644.3,"for all biological purposes, not just circadian settings? "
2647.44,"So, in the morning, it's clearly going to set the clock. "
2650.84,"And then, during the day, if I understand correctly, "
2653.86,"the idea is to get as much bright light as you can, "
2655.89,"because you're feeding, it sounds like a sort of "
2658.56,light hunger. - Exactly. 
2660.74,- I see. - I love this way to put it. 
2662.27,I think there is a weird light hunger 
2664.26,considering that we're not photosynthetic organisms. 
2667.71,There is a weird light hungers in animals 
2669.88,that they need measure. 
2673.17,And I think that relates to the season 
2675.13,because the whole reproduction cycle of animals 
2678.22,is going to depend on the availability 
2679.74,of food in the environment. 
2682.65,"And if you don't know when the season is going to happen, "
2685.29,"they don't have calendars, "
2687.04,it's going to be very hard to survive. 
2688.73,So I think that's why we have this light hunger. 
2691.1,That's a major hypothesis. 
2692.71,It's not been tested. - Interesting. 
2694.86,"So, then afternoon and evening start to approach. "
2699.12,"So, I've had this weird experience. "
2700.8,Maybe you can psychologically or biologically 
2704.04,"diagnosed me now, Samer. "
2705.26,"So, where if I go into a movie in the afternoon, "
2707.84,like a matinee. - Uh huh. 
2709.34,"- And I come out and it's dark, "
2711.53,I notice a significant drop in my mood 
2715.18,and my ability to go to sleep. 
2717.84,"Whereas if I get some view of the light in the evening, "
2721.41,"it doesn't have to be the sunset, although sunsets are nice, "
2723.94,but I get some light pulse in the afternoon 
2726.81,that I have no trouble whatsoever falling asleep. 
2729.22,- And this happens on a single time to watch them? 
2732.53,"- Yeah, more or less. - Wow, that's interesting. "
2735.48,- And then you mentioned the camping experiment 
2737.3,"where when they went camping, "
2738.44,they're seeing the sunrise and the sunset. 
2739.988,"- [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm. "
2741.17,- So what should people do in the afternoon 
2744.93,slash evening time in terms of their light viewing behavior? 
2748.22,"- I mean, the best thing to do is to let "
2750.27,"the natural light creep into darkness, right? "
2753.15,"That would be the best, "
2754.73,but clearly that would be inefficient. 
2757.11,"You want to go home, you want to read, "
2759.79,"you want to talk to your kids, you want to talk to your family. "
2763.43,"So, I think it's nice to extend the day. "
2766.04,I don't think that's wrong. 
2767.18,If you somehow can block that light 
2770.27,from affecting your circadian clock. 
2772.14,"- So, should people use blue blockers in the evening? "
2775.44,- I personally do not like any blockers 
2779.06,that take a single wavelength of light. 
2781.01,"Because again, if you think of a holistic approach, "
2784.27,"yes, the blue blocker is going to prevent you "
2786.23,from affecting your circadian clock very much. 
2789.61,But then your vision is going to be distorted 
2791.76,"because we always see in full spectrum, "
2794.26,"the sun has this beautiful spectrum, right? "
2796.9,"And then when you start seeing without the blue, "
2800.32,"things look yellow and it can get really weird, right? "
2803.78,"I mean, so I personally, "
2806.42,I've tried the blue blocker and I couldn't even wear them. 
2809.46,I thought they were just really horrendous to be honest. 
2813.04,"- Well, along the lines of blue blockers, "
2814.99,I think a lot of people mistakenly wear them all day long. 
2818.41,"- Oh my God, that would be very bad. "
2819.819,- A lot of people do that. - That would be very bad. 
2821.505,- A lot of people do that. 
2822.338,They think that blue light is bad. 
2824.1,"I think that the- - No, no, no. "
2825.26,- The concept of blue light being bad 
2827.97,led to a lot of product development. 
2830.43,And a lot of people are just assuming that viewing 
2832.89,blue light is what was giving them headaches. 
2834.63,When in fact it might've just been 
2835.87,looking at screens at close distance all day. 
2838.0,"- So, here's the problem, right? "
2839.213,"I mean, the blue light got the bad reputation "
2842.12,because people who gave a pure blue light 
2844.15,showed that it 'caused a huge retinal damage. 
2847.05,"But again, if you're using blue light in its pure form, "
2850.46,"it has a lot of energy because it's shorter wavelength, "
2853.65,but we're talking about full spectrum light. 
2856.44,There are ways now where you could change 
2859.0,the spectrum of the light and keep it white 
2862.13,between day and night and change the content of the color 
2866.31,without you noticing. 
2867.63,So you don't even have to affect your vision. 
2869.81,- So how would you go about doing that? 
2871.53,"- So, you just lower the level of the blue light. "
2873.906,You don't have to eliminate it. 
2874.98,- So just dim the lights? 
2876.32,"- Dim the blue, then increase the yellow, "
2879.26,but keep all the colors in a certain white. 
2882.9,"So, you know, you could have different warmness of white. "
2886.89,And people know how to do this. 
2888.29,Physicist know how to do this. 
2889.69,People who work with light know how to do this. 
2891.63,"- Well, maybe somebody in the wellness slash, "
2894.32,"I don't like the word, but biohacking, "
2895.88,or optical community will do this. 
2898.287,"I think it's really important, I see so many people "
2900.853,wearing blue blockers. - They have meetings now. 
2902.4,I don't know why they block- 
2904.08,"- Well, I think they're just uninformed. "
2905.23,"I think, frankly- - Yeah and to be honest, "
2907.17,"it's easy, right? "
2908.003,It's easier to explain to somebody if ipRCGs 
2911.305,"respond mostly to blue, remove blue, you'll be fine. "
2914.1,"- Right, right. - Right? "
2914.933,But that's not as simple as that because they also receive 
2917.42,rod and cone input. 
2918.38,So you want to actually... 
2920.05,"And we could go into details, "
2921.92,"that's boring for your listeners, "
2923.34,but it also affect the adaptation 
2925.25,properties of the whole retina. 
2927.17,So you don't want to do something so drastic 
2929.64,that you take just one color of the spectrum. 
2931.85,"It just seems very counter intuitive to me, to be honest. "
2936.53,"- You've told me before as well, "
2938.64,that just because these intrinsically photosensitive 
2942.42,"circadian setting ganglion cells respond best to blue light, "
2947.23,if the light is bright enough because they also get input 
2950.21,"from other components of the eye, "
2952.41,it doesn't matter if you block the blues. 
2954.66,- Yeah. - If you're looking 
2955.55,"at bright light at night, "
2956.56,you're going to disrupt your circadian cycle. 
2958.01,- Absolutely and that's why I didn't want to 
2959.523,"go into the boring details, "
2960.93,"but themselves, the photoreceptors have a wide range "
2964.05,of responsiveness. 
2965.37,"So they are more sensitive to blue light, "
2967.4,but that doesn't mean they don't respond to green light 
2970.35,or to shorter than blue light. 
2972.25,"They respond to very, very wide spectrum "
2975.35,with different sensitivity. 
2977.05,So unless you understand the system just removing 
"480,",
2980.69,I don't think it's going to do- - 
480,"nanometers, yeah. "
2983.52,"So, your home is a cave at night basically with some- "
2988.691,- It's a nice cave. - It's nice cave. 
2990.66,- Yeah. - With candles. 
2991.72,- That's right. - Right and you and your cats- 
2993.712,- And I watch TV and dim it. - And your lovely wife. 
2996.2,"- Yeah. - Who I know, who's also "
2997.08,a phenomenal scientist in her own right. 
2998.093,"- Thank you, yeah, she is. "
3000.092,- She is. 
3001.89,But you do keep your home quite dim 
3004.48,to dark at night? - Yeah. 
3006.16,"In fact, I did go to meetings with some of my friends "
3010.11,who work on this and they really struggled with me. 
3012.32,They said we could have broken our legs living 
3014.95,in the same light environment that you do. 
3017.01,"So I am an extreme, but I measured it for myself. "
3020.49,"And I asked, Rejji, my wife, if she's okay with it. "
3022.94,She also liked the dimness. 
3024.27,Both of us can see well in dim conditions. 
3027.18,"And that helps us a lot, "
3030.59,but I think you have to measure it for yourself. 
3032.78,You really have to... 
3035.01,It's a very simple experiment. 
3036.5,Just try to dim the light as much as you can. 
3039.05,I call it the minimum amount of light 
3041.57,you require to see comfortably. 
3044.29,- And that's how you want your environment 
3046.03,ideally at night? - At night. 
3047.2,This is what I think is the game changer. 
3050.0,"If you reach to a level where it's just barely, "
3053.44,you're literally on the cusp of seeing uncomfortably 
3056.63,"versus seeing very comfortably, "
3058.83,you are going to be very much better than 
3062.37,I don't like to make it completely dark. 
3064.31,I think complete darkness induce anxiety 
3067.55,"in humans, to be honest. "
3068.81,So I don't like complete darkness. 
3072.26,- Kids don't like complete darkness. 
3073.53,"They like a nightlight. - Even animal, "
3074.793,even nocturnal animals don't like complete darkness. 
3077.6,"I mean, we have studies in animals that are nocturnal, "
3081.07,"that if you put them in complete darkness for several weeks, "
3083.7,they have severe anxiety and depression like effect. 
3088.29,"So keep the light dim, use red light that is very dim, "
3094.03,if you want to keep the room for sleeping. 
3096.81,Red light that is very dim has very small effect 
3100.31,on the circadian clock. 
3103.26,And below 
10,"lux of red light, "
3105.02,literally doesn't affect sleep at all. 
3107.45,So there are ways to do it. 
3109.103,It's just we need to educate the public. 
3111.27,And I feel like you literally need a whole lecture 
3115.61,to just explain to the people how to deal with light 
3118.307,because it's not as simple as people think. 
3121.12,"- Well, that's what we're doing here. "
3122.31,- Yeah. - We're stepping through it 
3123.25,piece by piece and the reason we're doing that 
3126.375,"is because it's not as simple as saying, "
3128.18,"just block blue light or get a lot of light during the day, "
3130.37,"and minimal at night. - I mean, just to put it "
3131.287,in perspective and tell that we only have 
3134.35,three different cones in our retina 
3137.26,that respond to three different colors. 
3140.07,"We call them red cones for simplicity, "
3143.16,green cones and blue cones. 
3145.31,"Yet we have only three of these, "
3147.13,but we could see massive palette of colors. 
3150.67,So that tells you something. 
3152.34,If the system was just simply about a single color 
3155.82,and us just removing 
480,"or just blue is sufficient, "
3159.95,"then we should only see in red, yellow, and blue. "
3162.46,"We shouldn't see all these different hues of color, "
3165.16,"but because the system is not that, "
3167.42,we see all these different colors. 
3169.75,And that's why it's important to remind people 
3171.99,that the white light is made of many different colors. 
3175.54,It's actually like the rainbow. 
3176.99,"That's why you see the rainbow, it's made of many colors. "
3179.68,White light is never truly white. 
3181.64,It's made of lot of different colors. 
3183.86,- It's like the Pink Floyd album cover. 
3185.44,- Exactly. - With the light coming 
3186.714,"through the prism. - Exactly, exactly. "
3189.54,"- So, dim at night, maybe dim red light ideally, "
3193.0,or candle light. 
3193.833,Find that minimum required light level. 
3196.987,"- Test it, just make sure when you lower the lights, "
3199.4,sit for at least 
10,to 
15,"minutes, let your system adapt. "
3203.73,"Because if you had a bright light and you switch it off, "
3206.67,surely you're going to suffer because your system 
3208.7,didn't adapt yet; it was used to very bright light. 
3211.91,"So you want to engage your rods, "
3213.91,which take a long time to dark adapt. 
3216.77,"So that's why I tell you, just wait a little bit. "
3219.64,"Don't just switch it off and now I don't see, put it on. "
3222.38,"Put it off, sit down, wait for "
10,"minutes, "
3224.74,ideally 
15,minutes and then see how you see. 
3228.58,"And then once you do that, you will notice that actually, "
3231.93,"yeah, I could see quite well even with much less light. "
3237.6,- What do you do regarding screens? 
3240.45,"- Yeah, that's the hardest thing. "
3242.52,"Again, I mean, there are beautiful programs "
3245.33,that change the whole intensity and color of the screen. 
3248.74,These could help dim your screen at night 
3251.07,to the lowest part. 
3252.02,"I mean, yes, you won't see it "
3253.48,"when you wake up in the morning, "
3254.57,but then you can increase that intensity. 
3256.83,"So, try to decrease. "
3258.23,"I mean, just what we were talking about. "
3260.31,"Think of light intensity, duration, color, and time of day. "
3265.17,"You really have to keep these four things together, right? "
3268.75,- We've roomed together at a couple meetings 
3271.24,"from time to time, no longer, "
3272.66,because one of us not to be named has a severe snoring issue 
3276.78,that made the other one pseudo-homicidal. 
3279.259,[Samer laughing] 
3281.3,You can guess who that was. 
3284.59,But I've seen you check your phone 
3287.46,after dark once or twice. - Mm hm. 
3290.4,- And you did it by sort of pointing your phone 
3293.17,"away from you, right? - Exactly, yep, absolutely. "
3295.557,"- And actually I'm sort of half joking, "
3298.164,"and you dim it quite a bit. - Yeah, dim it quite a lot. "
3299.5,"- I'm sort of half joking, "
3300.47,but it actually makes sense that if you shine 
3302.73,"a flashlight in your eye, "
3303.79,it's much brighter than if you shine a flashlight- 
3304.623,"- Light only go in direct line, "
3306.47,"so if you'd just look on the side, "
3308.16,"most of the light is going to go this way, "
3309.86,and you're only seeing this way. 
3311.65,"- Okay, so, and as silly as that might seem "
3313.82,"to people listening, I mean what it means "
3315.46,is that getting bright light in your eyes at night 
3318.77,is something that you really want to avoid. 
3321.54,But there is the reality that- 
3323.01,"- And even when I check sometimes if I have something, "
3326.697,and I check it so fast and switch it off so fast. 
3329.3,So I'm also aware of duration- - Not my messages. 
3332.54,"- I'm also aware of the duration, right? "
3334.78,"So duration, intensity, color, and time of day. "
3338.24,Ideally I should not check iPhones an iPads. 
3341.18,I don't use iPad at night because it's hard 
3343.41,to lower it enough 'cause it's a huge. 
3346.48,"But even my iPhone, I try not to use it at night. "
3349.52,And like once it becomes 
8:,
30,or 
9:,
"00,",
3352.49,I don't look at it at all. - Unless it's World Cup 
3354.98,"or Euro Cup, in which case Samer's on "
24,"hours, everybody. "
3357.566,"- Right, that's only every four years. "
3360.473,- He's a big soccer fan. 
3362.23,"All right, this has been incredibly, no pun, illuminating. "
3367.78,Let's talk about the relationship between light 
3370.45,and some of these other non-circadian 
3373.6,or pseudo-circadian effects. 
3375.89,And we will try and link those. 
3379.18,But you had a what I consider absolutely landmark 
3383.38,"beautiful paper published in ""Nature"" a few years ago, "
3386.94,showing that if you disrupt the exposure to light 
3392.79,or the timing of the exposure to light 
3395.0,that there are dramatic effects on the stress system 
3398.15,and on the learning and memory system. 
3401.05,Maybe we could talk about each of those 
3403.08,separately or together. 
3404.98,What are the effects on stress and the effects on learning 
3408.07,when light viewing behavior 
3410.99,and sleep-wake cycles are disrupted? 
3413.35,"- Yeah, so just to remind you, you know that, "
3417.591,but to remind your listeners that I was trained 
3420.48,as a circadian biologist. 
3421.74,So I really was indoctrinated into thinking that light 
3426.48,"has to affect the clock, "
3427.67,which then caused all these different effects. 
3430.17,"So, that's what I believe. "
3431.91,That's my dogma. 
3432.76,That's what have made me really happy. 
3434.7,And then Tara LeGates and Cara Altimus joined the lab 
3439.935,and we started discussing a lot of data. 
3441.417,"And we said, what if there is a direct effect of light "
3444.2,"that we're missing, independent of the circadian clock? "
3447.24,"So this is not an easy question to us to answer, "
3449.99,"because as we've been talking all along, "
3452.08,light affects the circadian clock. 
3453.68,So how could you give light at different times of the day 
3457.337,and not mess up the circadian clock? 
3459.3,"Luckily, we came up with such a way, "
3461.04,and that's why it was important to do these experiments 
3464.95,the way we did them. 
3466.45,And we proved that this light-dark cycle 
3468.92,"does not disrupt the clock, "
3469.79,"there is still a circadian rhythm, "
3472.46,and does not cause sleep deprivation. 
3475.9,"And yet, surprisingly, if you give light "
3478.82,"at the wrong time of the day, "
3480.16,even without disrupting the circadian clock 
3482.76,"or without causing sleep deprivation, "
3485.01,as you mentioned you get the huge mood changes 
3488.62,in the organisms and you get learning deficit. 
3492.74,"So, this really, and at the time people have really "
3497.03,hit us hard. 
3497.863,"I mean, it was really hard to publish this work "
3501.14,"and you could, yeah. "
3502.73,"- Well, it came out in ""Nature."" "
3503.99,"- Yeah. - So in the end you prevailed, "
3506.87,but I want to make sure that I understand. 
3508.37,"So, you're saying that yes, "
3510.98,there are effects of light on the circadian rhythm. 
3513.22,- Absolutely. - Sleep meaning 
3514.053,sleep and wakefulness. - Yes. 
3516.11,- And their timing. 
3517.42,"However, there are direct effects of light on mood "
3520.85,that can be dissociated from the effects 
3522.893,on sleep and waking. - Absolutely. 
3524.85,"- So if I interpret that correctly, "
3527.17,"that could mean that when we view light and how much light, "
3532.87,"could make us feel happier or less happy or even depressed, "
3536.81,"stressed, learning, et cetera. "
3539.64,- Bingo. - Even if we're sleeping 
3542.01,and waking up at the appropriate time? 
3543.92,- Bingo. 
3544.753,"I mean, eventually because we're talking "
3546.74,"about the whole system, "
3548.06,"eventually when you start having the other problems, "
3550.41,"you also develop sleep problems, "
3552.9,but you're absolutely right. 
3554.2,"And in fact, now, research from Diego Fernandez "
3557.307,in the lab have found that now we know that they actually 
3561.57,require different brain regions. 
3563.13,"So we don't only have a theory, "
3565.2,we don't only have a light environment 
3566.94,"that showed they can be dissociated, "
3569.24,we know that they use completely different brain regions. 
3572.32,"So, the SCN that I told you about earlier, "
3574.59,"the place where the central pacemaker is, "
3576.7,the one that receives direct input from the retina 
3579.41,through the ipRCGs to adjust your circadian clock 
3583.09,is not the area that receives the light input 
3586.04,for mood regulation. 
3587.07,It's a completely different brain region. 
3589.03,- What's the brain region called? 
3590.19,"- So the brain region, "
3591.05,we called it the perihabenular nucleus. 
3594.08,"I'm not so sure how good or bad the name, "
3595.87,"but it doesn't matter, it's that PHb. "
3598.02,"And what's really amazing, "
3599.21,this region also receives direct input 
3601.29,"from the ipRCGs, but projects to areas in the brain "
3604.53,"that are known to regulate mood, "
3606.27,"including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, "
3610.59,which has been studied for many years 
3613.21,to be impacted in the human depression. 
3616.01,So just by this amazing serendipity 
3619.86,"to find that a region that is so deep in the advanced brain, "
3625.1,"like the prefrontal cortex is your executive brain, "
3629.07,"one of the most elaborated in humans, "
3632.06,to see that they receive inputs from 
3634.24,"these ancient photoreceptor was stunning to us, "
3638.26,and told us how much we didn't understand 
3640.41,the importance of light on a human behavior. 
3643.12,"- So, how does that finding inform daily protocols "
3647.66,for you or for other people? 
3648.98,I realize you can't leap always from one paper- 
3651.103,"- Absolutely, yes. - To daily protocol. "
3653.71,"But if light indeed does control prefrontal cortex, "
3657.14,"executive function, learning, stress and mood, "
3662.45,and let's say I'm waking up each morning and I'm sleeping. 
3665.18,What should I do different? 
3666.39,- That's why we came up with the tripartite model 
3668.92,"because yes, we could think about just adjusting the clock "
3672.16,with lights in and being dark throughout the day. 
3674.89,But that may not be important 
3676.41,for your whole physiological function. 
3677.94,"So, now, if we include these other effects of light, "
3681.69,that's why I prefer to still get a lot of light in the day. 
3684.67,I don't want to be in very dim light condition 
3686.93,throughout the day. - I see. 
3688.04,"- So, even though it doesn't affect your clock, "
3690.69,"as you beautifully said, Andrew, "
3692.13,it may affect your mood and learning and memory. 
3694.76,"It may affect your alertness level, "
3696.61,which is going to allow you to learn better. 
3698.55,"It may affect your homeostatic drive, "
3701.16,maybe your homeostatic factor would go higher 
3703.49,so you could sleep earlier. 
3705.27,So it's important to think of light as stimulating 
3708.53,"all these brain regions, "
3709.84,"which means it's producing more activity, "
3712.34,which in reality this is how people think 
3714.33,"of the homeostatic drive, that the more active you are, "
3717.18,"the more the homeostatic drive is built up, "
3719.73,the better you sleep. 
3721.52,So that's why we came up with the tripartite model 
3724.6,"because as a circadian biologist, "
3726.55,I only thought of light through the circadian clock 
3728.82,affecting behavior. 
3730.25,"As a sleep biologist, they only thought of the homeostatic "
3732.86,"drive affecting sleep, affecting behavior. "
3735.81,"And for people who study light for vision and other form, "
3738.6,they thought only of the environmental input. 
3741.01,"But now if you put them all together, "
3742.87,you get with this tripartite model 
3744.71,where it's really mind boggling. 
3746.66,And it makes so much sense. 
3748.32,"The organism doesn't want to depend on a single component, "
3751.63,"but if you could incorporate these three together, "
3754.7,you could have a beautiful system that is well adapted. 
3758.09,"So let me tell you the sleep-wake cycle, right? "
3760.35,So we know that there is a homeostatic drive 
3762.81,to affect sleep. 
3763.643,You've had beautiful talks about that. 
3765.89,"- Which is basically the longer you're awake, "
3767.51,the more you want to be asleep. 
3768.527,"- So, that's your homeostatic drive. "
3770.32,We've talked about the circadian influence of sleep 
3772.89,and the fact that light-dark cycle 
3774.97,"affect the circadian system, which eventually affects sleep. "
3778.07,So these two components are well understood. 
3780.29,Now the third factor is your direct light 
3783.18,or environmental input. 
3784.77,"How much stress, how much light you get from there "
3787.29,also can highly impact sleep. 
3789.66,"So even if you have a good circadian and homeostatic drive, "
3793.32,"if you're getting light at the wrong time of the day, "
3795.8,"or if you're being stressed and thinking a lot, "
3798.09,then your sleep is going to suffer. 
3799.83,So you have to think of the three together 
3802.66,to have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle. 
3805.07,- I see. - And that's why 
3806.41,we came up with the tripartite model. 
3808.12,The same thing happens with feeding. 
3809.7,I could beautifully put it to people. 
3811.75,"Your hunger, your energy level is measured "
3814.29,by the arcuate nucleus. 
3816.15,"Your daily intake of food is again, "
3818.3,dependent on the SCN and light-dark input. 
3821.12,"We found that if food is not available, "
3823.97,"there is yet a third input that is not depending on the SCN, "
3828.53,"not depend on the arcuate, "
3829.82,depending on a completely different brain regions. 
3832.86,So the animal can actually start looking 
3835.02,"or the human can start looking for food when it's scarce, "
3838.56,even at time when they are not supposed to be active. 
3841.56,"So, that's how the organism think, "
3843.21,they have to evaluate multiple inputs for them to decide 
3847.4,what is the best physiological outcome 
3849.27,"at that moment, at that season? "
3851.35,- I see. 
3852.98,"So, I want to get into arcuate and feeding, "
3854.73,but just to make sure we can keep our hands 
3857.42,around this tripartite model. 
3859.55,"So, if I understand correctly, "
3860.68,"we've got the circadian influence, "
3863.04,then you've also got the drive to sleep. 
3865.37,"- Right. - Actually, one of the ways "
3867.11,that I think that can be best understood is if somebody 
3870.29,"ever pulls an all-nighter, "
3872.1,they get tired around 
11:,
00,or 
12:,
00,"or so, "
3875.4,and then very tired around 
3:,
"00,",
4:,
00,"a.m., "
3878.53,but then even if you stay up sometime right around 
3881.113,
7:,
00,or 
8:,
00,"a.m., your normal wake up time, "
3882.87,you start to feel alert again. 
3884.21,- Exactly. - And that's because 
3885.52,"the sleep drive is extremely strong, "
3888.0,but there's a circadian rhythm that drives 
3889.84,wakefulness in the morning. - Exactly. 
3891.08,"- Okay, so that's two are the components. "
3892.78,- [Samer] Right. 
3893.76,"- Before we get into the feeding component, "
3895.33,I want to talk about these direct effects 
3896.57,of light on mood. - Mm hm. 
3898.06,"- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data. "
3901.13,And this perihabenular thing. - Sure. 
3903.6,"- So, let's just for the moment set aside the tri part "
3907.63,of the tripartite model and just focus on 
3909.65,what are the direct effects of light on mood? 
3912.06,And the way that I interpret what you've said so far 
3914.4,is that the protocol that emerges from this 
3916.63,"if one trying to optimize their mood is, "
3919.47,"yes, see light, view light I should say, early in the day, "
3922.83,in order to set your circadian clock. 
3924.61,Maybe also in the evening as well. 
3926.58,"And of course, avoid light at night, "
3928.71,get it as dim as possible. 
3930.51,"However, you said, it's also a good idea to get "
3935.81,"as much bright light during the day as you safely can, "
3938.92,in order to improve your mood independently 
3941.52,of regulating your sleep-wake cycle. 
3943.047,- And that's the hypothesis. 
3944.41,Here's the problem where it's not going to be 
3946.17,"as satisfying as the circadian is that as you know, "
3949.22,this brain region has been discovered very recently. 
3952.11,- Habenula? - The perihabenular region. 
3954.02,"- Well, we've known about it a long time, "
3955.39,but nobody knew what it did. 
3956.32,"- So, we knew about the habenula, "
3957.637,but that's why the name is confusing. 
3959.76,It's actually not the habenula itself. 
3961.777,"It's the perihabenular. - Oh, near the habenula. "
3963.46,- It's near the habenula. 
3964.32,- Why don't you just call it the Samer Hattar nucleus? 
3966.23,- I should have. 
3967.063,I don't know why I haven't done that. 
3968.55,"- Maybe 'cause if you do that, it's not okay. "
3970.51,"Okay, so for here ever after the perihabenular nucleus, "
3974.51,we should probably call it the Hattar- 
3976.223,- The Hattar-Fernandez. 
3977.056,- How about Hattar-Fernandez-Berson nucleus. 
3978.8,"- Yeah, that should- - Okay, this is like nerdy "
3980.84,"science attribution stuff, but I'm just going to call it "
3983.24,the Hattar nucleus. 
3984.74,"Wikipedia, line it up. "
3987.166,"Okay, so this structure is taking light, "
3989.38,"and independent of sleep rhythms and circadian rhythms, "
3992.35,it's driving changes in mood. - Something. 
3994.18,- How does it do that? 
3995.06,Is this through the dopamine system? 
3995.893,"The serotonin system? - We still recently, "
3998.98,we haven't identified this region very well. 
4001.164,We don't know what light does to it. 
4002.76,We don't know how it interacts. 
4004.74,So this is an area that is ripe for discoveries 
4007.66,and we're working on this right now. 
4009.68,"But that's why I said, it's not satisfying. "
4011.81,This is like the function of sleep. 
4014.06,Why do we sleep? 
4015.23,"We know sleep is very important to us, "
4017.09,but we still don't have a satisfying function 
4019.41,"of why do we sleep, right? "
4020.97,- I see but the why questions- - We have hypothesis. 
4022.754,"- The why questions, I think it's our good friend "
4025.19,"and colleague at University of Washington, "
4026.62,"Russ Van Gelder, who always says, "
4028.17,"when somebody asks why, that the best answer is just to say, "
4031.17,I wasn't consulted at the design phase. 
4032.95,"- Yeah, exactly. - Right, none of us "
4034.31,"really know why. - No, but the point is "
4036.52,"maybe I shouldn't have said why, "
4037.68,what is the function of sleep? 
4039.19,It's still very hard to know. 
4042.73,What is the reason organisms have to go offline for so long? 
4048.13,"You know, people assume it's for repair, "
4049.88,"assume it's for learning and memory, "
4051.367,"assume all kind of stuff, "
4052.73,but there is really no clear function for sleeping. 
4057.25,There is no clear function for sleeping. 
4060.059,"I mean, if you talk to people, there are hypotheses. "
4062.36,"- I mean, all we know is that if you don't sleep- "
4064.491,- Exactly. - Or your sleep 
4065.324,"is very fractured, you get messed up. "
4066.777,"- And you could die even, right? "
4068.49,"I mean, it's really bad if you don't sleep, "
4071.76,but we don't know what is the function? 
4075.64,What is that sleep have done to organisms 
4078.29,that couldn't have done with rest? 
4080.81,What if you just could rest without sleeping? 
4083.05,Just sit down and rest. 
4084.2,"- Well, my lab is trying to figure out whether or not "
4086.24,these non-sleep deep rest protocols 
4088.06,can compensate for sleep. 
4090.103,"- That would be interesting. - I mean, obviously sleep "
4091.16,"is better, but many people are not getting "
4093.69,the sleep that they need. 
4094.63,"- Right. - But, okay. "
4096.493,"So, and if people are sensing that Samer and I "
4099.04,"are about to start talking over each other and arguing, "
4101.06,that's always the goal 
4102.15,"when we talk, right? - That's right. "
4103.53,"- Unlike other scientists I interact with, "
4105.54,"when Samer and I get together, "
4106.72,it's considered a successful conversation 
4108.93,"if we get into a big fight, "
4110.24,and then go for a big meal- - That's right. 
4111.74,- Where I pick the restaurant. [Samer chuckling] 
4113.28,"Okay, so let's talk about food and eating and appetite. "
4119.13,"You had yet another, yes, I greatly admire your success "
4124.754,"in this way, yet another incredible discovery "
4128.21,showing that there are direct effects of light 
4132.89,on appetite and feeding behavior. 
4135.28,"Okay, maybe you could just summarize "
4136.46,those results for people. 
4138.57,"- Honestly, that paper is the one that allowed us "
4140.65,"to come with the tripartite model, "
4142.17,because we were thinking completely wrong about it. 
4144.9,"We wanted, this experiment, it'd be fun for your audience "
4148.7,to hear why we started this experiment. 
4150.93,"Remember that when we discovered the ipRCGs, "
4154.07,we figured if they are the only relay 
4157.376,"to entrain the circadian clock, "
4159.3,then you could kill them and have an animal opposite 
4162.77,to the one that we spoke or a human opposite to the one 
4165.3,that we spoke about earlier. 
4166.43,Where instead of having no pattern vision 
4169.41,"and have circadian photoentrainment, "
4171.57,"we could produce an animal that have pattern vision, "
4174.0,but no circadian photoentrainment. 
4175.761,"- Hm, so circadian blind. "
4177.58,"- Circadian blind, but pattern sighted. "
4180.8,And we succeeded in that. 
4182.88,"The problem when you have these animals, "
4184.54,which I've told you many times already 
4186.88,is that they don't adjust to the day-night cycle. 
4189.71,So doing experiments on them become very complicated. 
4193.33,- What is their behavior like if you don't have these cells? 
4195.83,"Are they awake and then asleep, awake and then asleep? "
4197.18,- They just drift like the humans we've talked about. 
4199.83,- They think they're in Las Vegas 
4201.351,"with no clocks or watch- - They drift, exactly. "
4203.01,- They stay up later every night and go to sleep- 
4204.45,"- They can either, depend on their clock. "
4206.39,"If their clock is shorter, they come in earlier. "
4208.61,"If their clock is longer, they come in later. "
4210.13,- So they're really messed up? 
4211.17,- They really don't adjust to it. 
4212.96,"If they were in the wild, "
4214.12,"they'll be eliminated in a second, right? "
4216.01,There is no way they'll survive. 
4218.02,"So, me and Diego started talking and we're like, "
4220.9,what if we use non-light in training agent? 
4223.65,And what is the strongest non-light in training agent? 
4226.86,Food. 
4228.02,So we thought that the light defective animals 
4232.65,will have more sensitivity to food entrainment 
4234.87,"because as you know more than me, "
4236.44,"this is an area that you've worked really well on, "
4238.88,"for vision, if you're image blind, "
4241.02,"your hearing and somatosensory get improved, right? "
4244.88,The lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation. 
4249.61,But we found actually that if you don't have 
4252.11,"the light to system, actually the food ability to entrain "
4257.49,the animal goes completely to the ground. 
4259.83,Completely opposite to what we predicted. 
4262.74,- So light viewing and feeding behavior are interacting 
4267.28,in ways that support one another. 
4268.667,- And that's why we came with the tripartite model. 
4270.99,We figured it's different than sensation of the environment. 
4274.28,"When you sense with vision, vision and hearing interact, "
4277.65,but your vision is a real full modality. 
4280.14,You want to see. 
4281.4,That's what vision wants to do. 
4283.15,You want to hear. 
4284.12,That's what hearing wants to do. 
4285.61,You want to sense. 
4286.48,That's what sensing want to do. 
4288.27,"But for the circadian system, light, food, "
4292.34,"all these entraining agent, "
4293.81,they somehow have to interact to keep a coherent system. 
4298.29,"You don't just assume if you remove light, "
4300.18,this one is going to be stronger. 
4301.42,"No, they need to know each others. "
4303.7,The light informs when the animal is going to eat. 
4306.39,"- Well, what I like about this so much is that "
4310.48,"in the world outside of science, "
4312.64,"in which I don't really exist in, but that I see a lot of, "
4316.55,this kind of wellness and stuff with 
4318.71,all this mind-body integration stuff. 
4321.97,It's interesting because people view the body 
4325.1,"more as a system, right? "
4326.61,"A system of organs that interact, "
4328.42,as opposed to the way that standard science 
4331.337,"and medical profession is like, "
4333.17,"you work on the liver or you're ear, nose and throat, "
4335.77,"or heart and lung, or brain or- "
4338.15,"- Wow, that's a great way of thinking about it. "
4340.1,- But the biology is integrated. 
4342.1,"- Yeah. - And so, for somebody who's "
4346.0,"interested in effecting their eating behavior, "
4349.36,"something that you are familiar with, "
4351.66,and that we will talk more about 
4353.01,"your experiences of in a moment, "
4356.38,how should they use light in order to adjust 
4359.33,their eating behavior? - Right. 
4361.45,"So, now that I've told you about all these interaction "
4364.21,"between the different inputs to the circadian clock, "
4367.81,"just you think about it as an engineer, "
4369.78,what would be the best thing? 
4371.33,The best thing is to know when your food times happen 
4375.27,"in the day, when should you get light, "
4377.37,"and when is your circadian clock in your system, right? "
4382.06,"So, if you eat at very specific times of the day, "
4385.52,"that's another signal that is telling your body, your clock, "
4388.69,you're in a certain time of the day. 
4390.61,"So if you're having lunch at the correct time every day, "
4393.33,"and you're getting bright light, "
4394.64,"now you have two systems that are informing your clock, "
4398.08,your clock is going to be better. 
4399.56,- So regular mealtimes? 
4401.03,- Regular mealtimes that fit your circadian clock. 
4404.19,"So, and in fact, if you do that, when I started doing this, "
4408.38,"and it helped me lose weight, "
4410.11,is that I'm exposing myself to the right amount 
4413.02,"of light-dark cycle, I'm eating at regular time. "
4415.92,It is amazing. 
4417.03,"You would be not hungry, let's say you eat at noon, "
4419.62,you will not feel any hunger at 
11:,
45.,
4422.693,And then all of a sudden the hunger jumps. 
4425.21,This is clearly not an energy issue 
4427.08,because it could not be that drastic. 
4429.49,"- No, the desire to eat is mainly driven by these cues, "
4434.17,these hormone cues that are very exquisitely timed to- 
4439.46,"- Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, "
4440.86,but also to light. - Exactly. 
4442.8,"And you know, in the wild, "
4444.54,you could imagine why energy level 
4446.43,through the arcuate nucleus- 
4448.077,- You should explain to people what the arcuate is 
4450.13,'cause I don't think we've done that adequately. 
4451.95,The arcuate nucleus is an area of the hypothalamus 
4454.31,that drives hunger and feeding behavior. 
4456.7,And what we're talking about is the fact that 
4459.22,"it's taking cues from your viewing of light, "
4463.12,"believe it or not, is impacting your level of hunger. "
4466.27,And this is a non-trivial way in which your timing of hunger 
4471.91,and amount of hunger is regulated by when 
4474.52,and how much light you view. 
4476.79,"So, let me ask you a couple of practical- "
4478.82,"- But can I just, this is really, before you asked me- "
4480.771,"- Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. "
4482.34,"We said we are going to fight, but to me, "
4485.2,"the interesting thing to think about it, "
4486.97,in the wild when you didn't have the availability 
4488.96,"of food that we have, the arcuate plays a huge "
4492.35,important role because if you weren't successful 
4495.82,"in getting food, then the arcuate is going to tell you, "
4498.61,"look, you have to take risks and go get food "
4501.16,because your energy level is very low. 
4503.24,"And that's great, there's tons of great research about that. "
4506.43,"But I think what's missing is the fact in humans, "
4509.36,we're not getting to a situation... 
4511.47,"Most of us, we're not getting to a situation "
4514.07,where we have low energy levels. 
4516.42,Most of the time actually we eat not because 
4518.557,"we are really have low energy, "
4521.44,but because we want to eat. 
4523.01,So I think that's why I feel that the timing 
4526.36,is very important for us because we always 
4528.99,have enough energy level for us to eat. 
4531.54,"- Well, I mean, I enjoy eating so much that I'll eat "
4533.88,just for the sensation of chewing. 
4535.44,"- True, true. - I mean, "
4536.273,"I enjoy the taste too. - True, absolutely. "
4538.31,- And I enjoy the social aspects 
4539.82,when those are a part of it. - Absolutely. 
4540.97,- But I literally enjoyed the physical act of chewing. 
4543.83,"- [Samer] Absolutely, absolutely. "
4545.73,Uh huh. - Which explains a lot. 
4549.3,"Okay, so how regular are you or do you recommend "
4554.48,people be about mealtimes? 
4556.27,Because what I'm hearing is that light viewing behavior 
4561.06,is pretty straightforward. 
4561.98,"Get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day, "
4563.92,"minimize it in the evening and at night, generally speaking, "
4567.43,for sake of mood and circadian rhythm. 
4569.15,But for sake of regulating timing and quality 
4573.594,"I should also say of food intake, "
4575.8,because people clearly make better choices about food intake 
4578.42,when they are anticipating a meal 
4580.74,and they aren't constantly hungry. 
4582.7,"And so, the ability to regulate hunger for particular phases "
4586.13,of the circadian cycle is quite valuable for all people. 
4589.16,"Not just people trying to lose weight, but all people. "
4592.35,Are we talking about down to the minute? 
4594.85,- Absolutely not. 
4595.683,"- All right, so "
12:,
00,"noon is my normal lunch, "
4598.71,let's say plus or minus? 
4601.42,- Half an hour. - Okay. 
4602.93,So eat around between 
11:,
30,and 
12:,
30.,
4606.1,- If that's the time. 
4607.287,And it depends if you also do multiple meals. 
4609.64,"Remember three meals, that's a decision that somebody "
4612.89,"came up with, I don't know why. "
4614.36,"- And nowadays, fewer people are doing that I think. "
4616.44,"- Yeah. - Given our friend, "
4617.953,Satchin Panda's work. - Right. 
4619.45,"I mean, so you could have two meals, "
4621.27,you could have very multiple meals that are distributed 
4626.16,across your active time. 
4627.97,I agree with Satchin Panda's work that try to avoid eating 
4632.53,"when your system is supposed to be relaxing, "
4634.89,when you're supposed to be at non-active times. 
4638.64,"So, limit your eating to the active time of your cycle. "
4643.63,"And that seemed to be, and Joe Takashi "
4645.91,"is doing some beautiful stuff on this, "
4648.21,that seems to be incredibly important 
4650.14,for aspect of the circadian. 
4653.34,- And for health. - And for health. 
4654.69,"- Yeah, we're referring to Satchin Panda's work, "
4657.55,"he wrote a beautiful book called ""The Circadian Code."" "
4659.87,"Maybe Samer, with some luck you'll write a book as well. "
4663.48,"Meaning the world will be lucky to have that book, "
4666.11,but Satchin's data really strongly point to the fact 
4669.61,"that liver health, brain health, metabolic factors, "
4675.33,and endocrine factors of various systems and organs 
4678.62,all seem to benefit from having a period of each 
24,hour day 
4682.27,in which we are not eating anything 
4683.66,and then eating at very regular mealtimes. 
4684.858,- [Samer] Absolutely. 
4686.84,- Let's talk about eating and mealtimes 
4688.6,and let's move a little bit away 
4690.34,"from the science for the moment, "
4692.18,"although we will return to it, "
4693.52,and talk a little bit more about your experience 
4696.71,with eating and mealtimes. 
4698.52,"So, you're looking in good shape lately. "
4701.47,- Thank you. - I know you've been 
4702.41,putting work into it. - Yeah. 
4703.77,- We talk a lot and you've been exercising 
4705.95,"and you've been eating well, meaning quality food. "
4710.53,You just came back from Jordan 
4711.58,where I'm assuming the food is amazing. 
4713.253,"- Yes, the food is amazing and honestly, "
4715.49,"usually I gain a lot of weight in Jordan, "
4717.79,"but this time I didn't gain any weight, "
4720.04,"which was really nice, so. "
4721.38,"- Yeah, when I met you, you were probably about "
100,pounds 
4728.74,heavier than you are now. 
4729.86,"- Yeah, "
275,pounds. 
4731.357,I'm 
219,now. 
4733.01,"It's crazy, yeah. - You had a lot of vigor then, "
4734.981,"and you have a lot of vigor now, "
4736.72,but I know that you undertook a very specific protocol 
4741.55,"in order to lose the weight, "
4743.77,based on your understanding of the circadian system- 
4745.55,"- Yes! - And of light, "
4746.98,and appetite and mood. 
4749.19,Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about 
4750.95,what that schedule looks like. 
4752.31,And we realize that this is not a prescriptive 
4754.38,"for everybody, but you found what worked for you. "
4756.73,- Yeah. - To maybe just describe 
4758.37,"those changes. - I mean, honestly, "
4759.46,"I followed my circadian cycle, right? "
4761.58,"Of what we've talked about, right? "
4764.02,"So I dimmed the light at night, I slept at regular hours, "
4767.97,I ate my major food in breakfast and lunch 
4771.05,when I'm really active and I'm really hungry. 
4773.66,"And at night when I avoid dinner, "
4775.76,because my circadian system really shuts off at 
3:,
00.,
4778.4,I'm an early person. 
4779.9,Like you could give me anything I would eat before 
3:,
"00,",
4782.43,after 
3:,
"00,",nothing appeals to me anymore. 
4784.78,My system is shut off. 
4786.14,"- Well, what time are you going to sleep? "
4787.27,And what time are you waking up? 
4788.103,"- Oh, so in my case, I should have put this up. "
4790.34,"I mean, I go to sleep literally at "
9:,
00,p.m.. 
4793.4,"I mean, I literally five minutes after "
9:,
00,"p.m., "
4796.61,I'm completely out. 
4798.4,And I wake up between 
4:,
30,and 
5:,
00,a.m.. 
4801.04,"So if I extend it, I go to "
6:,
00,"a.m., "
4803.63,but very rarely. 
4804.69,It depends on how tired I was. 
4806.65,"- And that, as I recall, was an important set of changes "
4810.63,for you to be able to- - Absolutely. 
4811.69,- Regulate your food intake. 
4812.543,"- Absolutely because then I'm having very big breakfast, "
4816.41,"and again for different people it's different, "
4819.46,I have a big breakfast at 
7:,
00,a.m. maximum. 
4822.88,"So I have a big breakfast, coffee, and all this stuff. "
4825.89,Then I have some simple snack around 
10:,
00.,
4829.05,"Then I have regularly lunch at noon, "
4831.06,or between noon to 
1:,
00.,
4832.25,Then I have another snack at 
3:,
00.,
4834.297,And the hardest time to regulate the food 
4836.24,is between 
12:,
00,and 
3:,
00.,
4837.073,This is when I really feel hungry all the time. 
4839.323,- This is your equivalent of kind of 
4840.87,late evening for most people. 
4841.92,"- Yes! - So for me, "
4842.759,it would probably be between 
7:,
00,and 
10:,
00,p.m.. 
4844.62,"- Exactly, exactly. - Got it. "
4846.4,"- And then at night I'm completely not hungry, "
4849.02,"but usually as you said, "
4850.4,"the beauty or the enjoyment of food, "
4852.66,"like when my wife cooks some really beautiful Indian food, "
4856.13,"I eat, but I'm not hungry. "
4858.19,"And I notice if I eat with that, I usually gain weight. "
4861.16,"But if I regulate that at night, I also lose weight. "
4864.44,So there is a combination of all these things that help you 
4868.22,"adjust the input of food, the input of light, "
4872.37,"the input of the clock, and the drive to hunger. "
4875.92,"- Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that. "
4877.49,And I want to emphasize that some people 
4879.52,are not hungry early in the day. 
4881.17,They might be late shifted people. 
4882.761,"- Exactly. - In which case, "
4883.594,eating later in the day will work well for them. 
4885.024,- It will work well as long as they don't eat 
4886.63,early in the morning. 
4887.463,"That's just, you have to work with your schedule, "
4889.9,with your active schedule. 
4891.46,"- Yeah, you and I have been talking "
4892.293,about this offline for years. 
4893.78,I'm glad we're finally having this discussion publicly now. 
4896.71,What we're talking about really is finding 
4898.27,your ideal sleep schedule. 
4899.77,"- Exactly, exactly. - And finding your ideal "
4902.38,eating schedule. - Exactly. 
4903.79,- And understanding how those two things interact. 
4906.532,"- And do you know the nice thing, as you said, "
4908.07,finding them out is going to help you 
4909.74,to understand how they interact 
4911.43,because we know from the tripartite model 
4913.03,that they are all interconnected. 
4915.86,And for each person they're going to be 
4917.59,interconnected differently. 
4919.63,"So, for each person you would... "
4922.01,"You know, for me, if I exercise at night, "
4925.37,I'm going to mess up my whole system. 
4926.953,- When do you exercise? - Morning. 
4928.96,Morning works great for me. 
4930.48,"I mean, it's amazing. "
4931.84,Morning exercise for me works great. 
4934.57,"If I tried one time, because it was easier for me "
4937.28,"to exercise at night before I leave, "
4939.27,when the traffic is there from the night. 
4941.117,And I think that messed me up because I couldn't sleep well 
4944.7,and I couldn't wake up well. 
4946.06,And that led to more changes in my food. 
4947.89,"I gained weight again actually, believe it or not, "
4950.91,even though I was exercising. 
4952.64,So I think this really makes me think that you have to think 
4956.93,of the tripartite model to see what is the best times 
4961.37,and what is the best interrelation between 
4963.59,"the different component, as you beautifully said, "
4965.94,"between your mealtimes, your light exposure, "
4968.38,and your sleep that works for you. 
4970.81,"- Well, thanks for that. "
4971.643,Usually Samer's insulting me. 
4973.13,"Today, he's complimenting me. "
4974.61,"I'm going to compliment him right back by saying, "
4977.12,this is the first time that I've ever really understood 
4981.5,"how yes, light can control sleep. "
4984.49,"Yes, it control mood. "
4987.1,"Yes, it can impact feeding, "
4989.1,but that it's really about doing the self exploration 
4991.75,to align those in the way that works best. 
4994.62,"And what I'm hearing, tell me if I'm wrong, "
4996.56,but what I'm hearing is that once you understand 
4999.37,"what gives you the best sleep-wake cycle, "
5001.98,then you should exercise during the period of time 
5005.53,in which you feel most alert. 
5007.68,"And if it works for your schedule, "
5010.73,ideally you would also eat during the time in which 
5013.19,you feel most alert and then stop eating 
5015.767,and stop light viewing behavior as you head towards sleep. 
5018.27,- Right. 
5019.103,"So, the only thing I would say that complicates all of this, "
5022.3,"and that's what makes me sad, is your light exposure. "
5025.12,- Mine personally? - Sorry. 
5026.18,"- No, I'm just kidding. "
5027.95,"- The people's light exposure, right? "
5029.9,This is what complicates it because you're not going to be able 
5033.63,to figure all this out if you're shifting yourself 
5036.49,out of your comfort zone. 
5037.74,- By viewing- - By viewing light 
5039.51,at the wrong time of the day. 
5041.24,"So, let's say if you were under an ideal natural conditions, "
5047.01,you're a person who would sleep later than me. 
5049.26,Let's say we'll sleep at midnight and wake up at 
8:,
00,a.m.. 
5052.97,"Let's say you don't eat anything till noon, "
5055.01,"and as you said, you eat late in the evening. "
5057.86,"Then this would be perfect for you, "
5059.61,but now see what happens if now you include 
5062.47,the light component. 
5063.32,"Now, if you push your sleep from midnight to "
4:,
00,"a.m., "
5066.81,now you're waking up in the morning and you're actually 
5070.7,really not the morning... 
5071.89,"You're working, I'm sorry, at noon instead of eight o'clock, "
5075.05,"and the time where you're not supposed to be hungry, "
5077.47,now you're going to start eating directly at noon 
5079.74,"or something like that, or even delay it. "
5081.72,And now you're shifting your whole cycle. 
5083.99,"And you don't know if this interaction between your sleep, "
5086.5,feeding and the light-dark environment 
5088.29,are still going to be maintained or not. 
5090.6,And that's the problem that people have. 
5092.51,"- So, as I'm hearing this what I'm realizing is most of us, "
5096.69,"probably me included, are messing up at least one, two, "
5100.83,"or three of these components. - Exactly, exactly. "
5102.46,"- But that the probe, the way to figure out what's right "
5106.98,for oneself is to start manipulating light exposure. 
5110.33,"- Right and I'm going to be honest, "
5112.61,I'm biased 'cause I believe that light 
5115.16,is the strongest time giver. 
5117.97,And a lot of people disagree. 
5119.61,Some people think feeding is. 
5121.09,"- I always thought that light was the primary zeitgeber, "
5123.41,"the primary light- - Yeah, but a lot of people "
5125.02,think it's food. 
5125.853,A lot of people even sometimes mentioned social interaction. 
5128.67,- Have they read the literature? 
5130.01,- I agree with you. 
5131.127,I totally agree with you. 
5132.47,"- I mean, my understanding is that light "
5133.85,is the most powerful driver- - Absolutely. 
5135.537,- Of the things we're talking about. 
5136.48,- That's why I think we need to regulate this first 
5138.7,and everything else fits. 
5140.47,"And you know, the nice thing is that your sleep-wake cycle "
5143.4,and exercise tell you really bluntly 
5145.87,if you're doing it right or not. 
5147.273,- Tell me more about that. - I'll tell you more. 
5148.81,"When I shifted my exercise, honestly, "
5152.17,things fell apart like never before. 
5154.32,- When you moved from exercising early in the day 
5156.743,"to late in the day? - In the morn, yeah. "
5157.576,It completely fell apart for me. 
5159.52,I didn't enjoy exercise at night. 
5161.52,My pain tolerance for exercise wasn't as good. 
5164.32,I'm talking with N equals one and I'm aware of this. 
5166.53,"I've never tested this empirically, but at least to me, "
5170.5,it really messed up everything. 
5172.39,I started having problem because my body temperature 
5174.55,would go up and that will affect my sleep. 
5177.01,I possibly was running in the gym with a lot of lights. 
5179.5,"So maybe the light was a component, but for me, "
5183.1,"exercising in the morning, it's so much better for me. "
5186.417,But a lot of people can't even 
5187.95,think of exercising in the morning. 
5189.79,So it depends on when you feel comfortable 
5192.0,in your sleep-wake cycle and your exercise. 
5194.22,I think that tells you if your system 
5195.91,is in synchrony with one another. 
5198.51,- That's really interesting. 
5200.15,"We're good friends, our friend, Pat Dossett, "
5202.563,"that we both know. - Mm hm, oh, absolutely. "
5203.89,- He did nine years in the Seal Teams. 
5205.76,"And he's one of these people he says, "
5207.63,he's happy to go for a run or a swim anytime 
5210.03,between 
4:,
30,a.m. and 
6:,
00,a.m.. 
5212.6,And he'll train in the afternoon too 
5214.21,"'cause he's a Seal Team guy and they'll do whatever anytime, "
5217.42,"that's part of the phenotype, "
5218.86,"but he feels best doing that, right? "
5222.35,I like to exercise mid-morning. 
5224.104,- Interesting. - And I'm happy to skip eating 
5225.88,until 
12,or 
1:,
00.,- Great. 
5228.282,- And I like to go to sleep around 
11:,
"30,",
12:,
"00,",
5230.265,'cause I'm a normal human being rather than you 
5232.1,who goes to bed at 
9:,
00,p.m. - What about Pat actually? 
5234.13,I've never asked him what time. 
5235.32,- Pat? 
5236.153,"So, Pat's ideal to sleep time, I've asked him this, "
5238.71,would be around 
8:,
30,or 
9:,
00,except now- 
5241.155,"- Oh, so I'm like Pat! - Yes, but he has two "
5244.65,"young children, two years old and a newborn. "
5247.65,"And so, the cycle is disrupted, right? "
5249.287,"- Yeah, but that's known, right? "
5251.6,I mean the effect of childbearing. 
5253.46,- Right. - And I think that we could 
5254.88,"talk about this, that's more complicated- "
5256.974,- Right. - But that's pretty much. 
5259.13,"- Yeah, I mean, I think we need to come up with a new name "
5261.57,"for chronotype because- - I agree, I agree. "
5263.66,- Chronotype implies that it's just about sleep and wake; 
5267.06,being an early bird or a night owl. 
5268.88,And what we're also talking about is how exercise 
5271.25,and eating match onto those. 
5272.887,- The the phase relation between them. 
5276.04,- Right. - And the phases between 
5277.63,"different components, as you said. "
5279.44,- 'Cause they interact. - Because they interact. 
5281.18,- Right. - And they don't have 
5282.55,to be in the same phase. 
5283.53,Like let's say my light and food 
5285.57,could be very close to each other. 
5287.01,"Your light and food could be different, right? "
5289.35,"The phases don't have to be, they can be plastic. "
5291.87,So you have to find this for yourself. 
5294.258,"You maybe you're a person who eats late at night, "
5297.05,"exercises late at night, "
5298.95,"or you may be a person who exercise early, eat later. "
5301.51,"So, as long as the phase is good, "
5305.22,that's what you have to find out. 
5307.36,"- Okay and if I understand correctly, "
5308.9,"when you're talking about phase relationship, "
5310.35,"it means you want to lump exercise, feeding and light for- "
5314.14,- And sleep. - And sleep in a way 
5316.4,that as a coherent and total system 
5319.61,makes you feel really good. 
5321.17,- Temporally in a great order. 
5323.27,- Uh uh. - Absolutely. 
5325.29,- And I think that- - And I could tell you to me 
5327.54,"is literally getting exposed to sun clearly in the morning, "
5332.48,"clearly at noon, I go out, "
5333.98,"I keep my windows in the office completely open, "
5337.43,eating mostly in the early time of the day and exercising. 
5340.56,"And literally at the end part of the day, "
5343.41,I'm not really in a more thoughtful vegetative state. 
5347.63,Like I really can't like after 
5:,
"00,","I tell my students, "
5351.23,"if you want to tell me anything complicated, "
5353.12,you're wasting your time. 
5354.36,My brain just doesn't function. 
5356.35,"So even though I only sleep at night, "
5357.91,"but I'm really starting to shut off, ramp down. "
5361.14,"Really I mean, I could send email, "
5364.43,"talk about brainless stuff, but my power, "
5367.65,my energy to do powerful stuff really drop tremendously. 
5372.29,"So all my students who know me very well, "
5374.34,they put the meetings with me early in the morning 
5376.98,'cause they know this is when I'm... 
5378.63,"So, everything for me and for me, it's very tight. "
5381.64,So it could be different for... 
5383.09,It's very clustered in the morning. 
5384.373,It's all tied together. 
5386.0,And literally the remaining part 
5387.37,seems to be just a vegetative state. 
5390.431,- Mm hm. 
5391.44,"Yeah, you and my bulldog, Costello, "
5394.7,who unfortunately passed away recently. 
5396.35,- Oh no. - Yeah. 
5397.477,"- I did not, that's so sad. - Yeah, Samer and Costello "
5399.01,were good friends. 
5399.843,"Yeah, sorry to break it to you here. "
5401.57,"Yeah, he had a good long life and he went easy, "
5404.46,but he had a circadian clock that basically would just sleep 
5407.3,around 
24,"hours a day, "
5409.77,minimal activity interspersed every third day or so. 
5413.84,You do have this morning vigor. 
5415.81,- Yes. - And I think other people 
5418.46,are going to have more of an afternoon vigor. 
5419.89,Do you think that this can change across the lifespan? 
5423.856,The rumor is that teenagers naturally want to sleep in later 
5428.19,and stay up later. 
5429.44,Do you think that's social rhythm? 
5430.84,Or do you think that that's actually biological? 
5432.5,"- Yeah, that's a tough question. "
5433.89,"I mean, it could be both. "
5437.43,"One thing that worries me is that it seems that if anything, "
5441.34,with age this morning rigor gets stronger. 
5444.912,"- You mean, you want people to become more "
5446.18,of morning people. - More of morning people. 
5447.013,"- Well, why does that worry you? "
5447.846,I think that's good. 
5449.0,"- Because for me, I'm already very shifted morning. "
5451.76,I don't want to be one of these 
7:,
00,p.m. 
5453.74,to 
1:,
00,a.m. sleepers at some point. 
5456.0,"- On the other hand, it's also kind of nice "
5457.64,because it's quiet and you can get work done. 
5459.12,"- Yeah, but honestly from "
4:,
30,till 
7:,
30,
5462.35,"when my wife wake up, it can be very long. "
5465.77,"Yes, you achieved a lot, but it's quiet outside. "
5469.991,"So, I don't want to be at "
1:,
00,"a.m., let's put it this way. "
5472.95,- You can tell Samer is more social than I am. 
5475.606,"- That's right, that is true. "
5477.057,- But we should touch on that actually. 
5478.57,"So, your wife, she follows a different schedule. "
5482.08,"- Yeah. - So, the social rhythm- "
5484.85,- I'm honestly... - Is important I think. 
5486.89,What should we do? 
5487.86,How should we conceptualize and how should we adjust 
5491.32,ourselves according to the social rhythm? 
5492.153,- And I honestly love this hypothesis 
5495.36,that people came up with and Pat's kids reminded me of. 
5499.32,"Because kids are really going to disrupt your sleep-wake cycle, "
5502.87,it seems like there is a chrono attraction. 
5506.64,That's usually people who attract each others 
5508.98,have actually different sleep-wake schedule. 
5511.85,And the idea being is that this allows them 
5514.19,to take care of their kids throughout the day-night cycle. 
5517.19,- And have a peaceful marriage. 
5518.75,"- And have a peaceful marriage in a way, right? "
5521.24,"So, I mean, we didn't have kids, me and Rejji. "
5523.39,"So maybe this is, but it seems like evolutionary "
5526.55,"it makes sense that if you want to protect your kids, "
5529.98,"you don't want everybody to be morning vigor, "
5532.08,and then the kids don't have. 
5533.68,So you want it distributed across. 
5534.72,"I mean, it makes sense. - It's a reasonable argument. "
5537.86,- Yeah. - I've heard that one 
5539.18,of the reasons that people think that the clock 
5542.37,is not exactly 
24,"hours, "
5544.68,but it's 
24,hours plus or minus 
20,"minutes or so, "
5548.45,"is because we believe that we evolved in clans or groups, "
5553.8,"villages, whatever, that were about "
100,to 
200,people. 
5557.09,And in order to have protection around 
5560.27,"the early morning hours- - Interesting, same idea. "
5561.81,- When we're vulnerable to predation 
5563.93,"and in the late night hours, "
5565.49,that you would want some individuals of our species 
5568.17,to be naturally more like night owls 
5570.07,and some more like early people. 
5571.3,So your theory of parenting is similar in that way. 
5575.96,- Right. - The social rhythm 
5577.62,is a powerful rhythm though. 
5579.2,"Meaning if I go out and I'm tired, "
5582.49,let's say I'm tired at like 
9:,
30.,
5584.01,"I don't want to go out, like I'm to need- "
5585.203,- So can I just say something about that? 
5586.643,I think the social rhythm is powerful at the obvious levels. 
5591.41,"Like it affects your sleep, "
5593.27,"it affects how much you wake up or eat, "
5595.9,but I'm not so sure it's as powerful as people think 
5598.61,on the clock. 
5599.79,"Now, eventually it will mess up the clock "
5601.81,"because now if you're doing a lot of social at night, "
5604.76,"getting enough light, eating at the wrong time of the day, "
5607.03,"eventually you're going to have an effect, "
5609.8,but I don't think just the social interactions themselves 
5613.88,have been shown to affect your clock very strongly 
5616.32,"for some reason. - Yeah, that's good to know. "
5618.63,"Well, for people hearing this, "
5620.6,they're probably getting the impression 
5622.25,"like I'm the night owl, and then Samer is the one "
5625.37,that's in bed at 
9:,
00,and then wakes up at 
4:,
00.,
5628.91,"But having attended many meetings with Samer, "
5631.34,I can tell you that he's the party animal. 
5633.53,So let's talk about that. 
5636.01,"I mean, let's talk about the fact that you're the partier, "
5638.7,who's up until 
2:,
00,"dancing at these various meetings, "
5641.86,which I've seen. - Yep. 
5642.923,"- He's actually a good dancer I'm told, "
5645.65,"but what should we do when we do stay up very late, "
5650.93,for whatever reason; could be because we had 
5652.96,"to take a midnight trip to the hospital, "
5654.69,"an unfortunate reason, "
5655.67,or it could be because you're in the presence of people 
5658.4,that you don't see very often and you go out 
5661.35,for a really nice night out on the town and you get to sleep 
5664.41,around 
2:,
30,or 
3:,
00,in the morning. 
5667.22,How should one get back on schedule? 
5669.16,Do you force yourself to then get up and view light 
5671.36,at the normal time that you would get up and view light? 
5673.47,Or do you allow yourself to sleep in? 
5675.05,What what's the optimal protocol? 
5676.003,"- I would allow myself to sleep in, "
5677.81,and remember this is a long-term effect. 
5680.02,This is something that you live with for a long period. 
5682.794,And remember I told you about the experiments 
5685.21,"we did with the mood, "
5686.31,these required two weeks of that light schedule 
5688.95,to cause mood disturbances. 
5690.57,So these don't happen just in a single day. 
5692.79,- So this is the way you justify staying out late 
5695.11,"every once in a while. - Well, in the meetings "
5697.4,"you've seen me in, "
5698.233,"I've done this for five or six days continuously, "
5700.65,"but what you didn't see that when I came back to my home, "
5703.45,it took me two weeks as if I did a jet lag. 
5705.97,So I really do suffer for two weeks 
5708.28,"after doing a six crazy night of staying up at night, "
5712.18,drinking at the wrong time of the day. 
5714.06,So it's not that I'm completely okay with it. 
5716.95,"When I go back, everything goes back. "
5718.57,It takes me actually literally two weeks to recover 
5721.37,from the circadian rhythm meeting 
5723.23,that you've seen me partying at some point. 
5725.88,- Which is kind of ironic that the circadian rhythm- 
5727.473,- I know. - Meaning people are totally 
5729.19,"disrupting their circadian cycle, "
5730.6,but scientists are human beings too. 
5732.72,"- Right, so I think if you do it at very little occasions, "
5738.39,I think you should not worry too much 
5740.99,that this will have lasting impact. 
5742.85,"And the good news is that if you readjust your schedule, "
5745.98,you could come back to it. 
5747.21,The problem is when you maintain this wrong schedule 
5750.33,"for a prolonged time and it becomes chronic, "
5753.16,"prolonged periods of time, "
5754.28,that's when you have the problems 
5755.99,and the accumulation of the problems. 
5758.17,"So when you have sleeping problem, "
5760.36,you produce metabolic problem. 
5761.76,"When you have metabolic problems, "
5763.02,you produce lack of exercise. 
5764.85,And you could see how things can spiral out very quickly. 
5768.38,And then it would be hard to come back to it. 
5771.06,"- Well, certainly sleep disruption is both "
5772.94,a symptom of and- - Yes. 
5775.19,- A cause of almost all- - Absolutely. 
5777.62,- Mental health disorders. - Absolutely. 
5779.72,- And certainly the metabolic syndromes 
5782.07,"that people are talking about nowadays and all of this, "
5785.12,it all funnels back to light. 
5788.07,"This is what's so remarkable. - Eventually, yeah. "
5790.08,"- And so we have these devices, "
5791.75,and I use my phone and I use my computer. 
5795.21,But do you think that the mere dimming of the screen 
5798.5,"or not interacting with screens, "
5802.43,say 
90,"minutes or two hours before bedtime, "
5805.79,"according to what we're saying today, "
5808.96,this should have a profound effect 
5810.59,on all these factors. - And it does. 
5812.22,And I really believe it does. 
5813.87,"And, again, I think as Pat did these inventions "
5819.49,where you get a pouch where you put your phone in a pouch. 
5822.22,"- Mm hm, so, what Samer's referring to is our friend, Pat, "
5826.18,"this former Seal Team member, "
5828.9,who's also very impressive person in the landscape 
5831.3,"of business and family, et cetera. "
5832.78,A real superhuman by any regard has this habit of taking 
5838.56,his phone and putting it into a sealed pouch 
5840.97,in the evening. - Yeah. 
5841.868,- So it's basically walled off- 
5842.701,- And in his program he sends you actually 
5844.971,these sealed pouches. 
5847.45,And so that I think is a great idea because not only 
5851.34,"it will take away the light from you, "
5853.44,but it also take away the distraction 
5855.25,"because you want to repair and recover, and sleep does that. "
5859.89,"And if you have your phone dinging all the time, "
5862.31,"or the light flashing from it, "
5865.07,you're just not getting enough sleep 
5866.647,and you're causing yourself major problems. 
5870.975,"- I never asked you this, but I realized now "
5873.2,"that I should have long ago, but I'll ask you now. "
5879.13,Why and how did you get into all this stuff? 
5882.41,"- Yeah, I mean, honestly, first of all, "
5885.14,I wanted to study genetics and I knew 
5889.16,I wanted to do PhD in genetics. 
5891.87,But I only got accepted in one university at the time. 
5894.53,And I joined the Learning and Memory Lab. 
5896.86,"And I liked learning and memory at the beginning, "
5898.7,"I worked on the snails on Aplysia californica, "
5901.3,and started looking at learning and memory. 
5903.22,But then the same lab was looking at these daily variation. 
5906.74,I was really struck. 
5908.43,Like you never think about it outside of science. 
5911.05,It's really struck me that organisms 
5914.54,can measure day biologically. 
5917.38,That was very shocking to me. 
5919.21,And I just really got attracted and I wanted to see 
5922.66,why does this happen? 
5924.54,What is the effect of different times of day? 
5926.4,And I just stuck with it. 
5927.73,"It just, it was mind blowing for me "
5930.14,"who was in medical school, "
5932.01,that I've never heard about it before. 
5934.39,"You know, it's really amazing medicine, "
5936.2,I think still now we are very good 
5938.96,"at looking at stuff spatially, "
5941.17,but we're very bad at looking at temporal aspects. 
5944.65,"So we always like to see images, static images, "
5948.3,spatial information. 
5949.133,"- Right, take an x-ray, measure a temperature- "
5951.044,"- Yeah, exactly. - Measure a blood pressure. "
5952.84,- But we don't think of temporal. 
5954.87,"And you talk to John Hogenesch right now, "
5957.45,and he's telling you the importance of chronomedicine 
5960.525,or chromo pharma... 
5962.9,Whatever the word is. 
5964.07,And it really just getting the drugs 
5967.68,at the right time of the day is going to be essential 
5970.16,for our health. 
5971.5,"- Do you think that's going to come from using better trackers, "
5973.95,"like Oura rings, WHOOP straps, these kinds of things? "
5977.34,"- I love the trackers, "
5978.4,but I think there's even more exciting discoveries. 
5980.84,Now you could take a single blood sample 
5982.91,and measure many biological components 
5985.61,and figure where you are in the circadian clock. 
5988.15,Something that was very hard to do before. 
5990.64,"So if you have a marker to know where you are in the clock, "
5993.49,you could actually understand more the effect of everything; 
5996.78,"exercise, feeding, light input. "
5998.81,- What is the marker? 
6000.01,- So there are some papers from what's her name? 
6003.49,Phyllis Zee and from Achim Kramer 
6007.01,where they measure multiple RNAs 
6008.9,"that are known to tell you what phase of the clock is, "
6011.9,or multiple proteins or biological reactions. 
6016.7,"And depending on a combination of factors, "
6019.23,"not a single factor, "
6020.17,you could tell where you are in the circadian clock. 
6023.4,So they could instead of just measuring temperature 
6025.92,"or melatonin, just one measurement. "
6027.9,"And melatonin specifically, is also complicated by the fact "
6030.48,that melatonin is affected by light. 
6034.157,"And temperature, your temperature and sleep can be "
6036.58,"easily dissociable, right? "
6038.314,"When you travel up those different timezone, "
6039.617,you sleep at different times in the temperature cycle. 
6043.33,So having multiple components measured will give you 
6046.69,"a better determination of your circadian phase, "
6049.82,and understanding your circadian phase in humans 
6053.25,will telling you what is the effect of giving certain drugs 
6056.05,at certain times of the circadian phase. 
6057.74,"So, in the future, this is going to be studied "
6060.32,at a much higher level when you can determine the phase 
6063.63,in relation to all the other stuff. 
6067.06,"- It's striking to me that in all animals, besides humans, "
6072.08,if they deviate too much from the appropriate exposure 
6075.32,"to light and light-dark cycle, "
6076.9,they essentially don't mate and/or die 
6080.5,and/or get killed off. 
6082.36,"But in humans, we are able to override that at least "
6085.46,"to some extent, but the ways in which we suffer appear to be "
6090.33,"things like obesity, metabolic syndromes, "
6093.99,reproductive syndromes that are accompany 
6095.98,"the other syndromes, you know, endocrine syndromes, "
6098.4,and mood and depressive disorders. 
6101.26,Is there any effort at the level of the nationally 
6105.66,or laboratories that you're aware of 
6107.65,to try and use light in order 
6109.92,to improve mood and mental health? 
6112.44,"- I mean, honestly, this is my mantra. "
6114.54,"This is the thing that I think people, "
6117.22,"because I say, don't take a pill, take a photon. "
6120.727,"And not, I mean, you take pills. "
6122.39,That's important. 
6123.223,I'm just making it that really we have an opportunity 
6126.93,"right now with the incredible advances of LED lights, "
6130.46,"of changing spectrum of light, of regulating intensities. "
6135.92,"And just for simple changes, "
6139.05,"you could really improve sleep-wake cycle, productivity, "
6142.94,and still you could actually get more done 
6145.57,"because as we've talked about, "
6147.54,"when you have all these messed up, "
6149.57,"now you have to sleep more, but your sleep is fragmented. "
6152.91,It's not very good. 
6154.1,- And you can't focus when you do sit down- 
6155.253,- And you can't focus or you don't have alertness 
6157.522,when you need the alertness. 
6159.34,So having all these could allow you to do even more actually 
6164.0,at the end than less. 
6165.353,And that's the exciting part it. 
6167.97,- One of the questions I get asked most often about 
6170.45,is about ADHD. 
6171.73,I think there's a lot of self-prescribed 
6174.17,as well as clinically prescribed ADHD. 
6176.25,People are having a tremendously difficult time focusing 
6178.9,"and not just because they're sleepy, "
6180.58,they just can't seem to anchor their attention. 
6182.3,"And there could be multiple reasons for this, "
6184.2,but there are now several clinical trials ongoing 
6186.85,using light to try and anchor people's attention and mood 
6190.27,and wellbeing for sake of focus. 
6192.0,And I think that while I love this saying 
6194.54,"that you mentioned, ""Take a photon, not a pill."" "
6197.69,And with due respect to the need for pharmacology 
6201.51,"for some certain people, "
6202.743,I think most people just haven't really dialed in 
6206.08,their relationship to light in a way that allows them 
6208.15,to rule out whether or not they need medication. 
6209.743,"- Absolutely, absolutely. "
6211.34,That's the best way to put it. 
6212.67,I can't add to that. 
6214.8,- Let's talk about jet lag. - Mm hm. 
6217.62,"- But not in the context of, okay, if somebody's traveling "
6220.93,"from Europe to Japan or from the east coast, "
6223.27,"because that varies tremendously, right? "
6225.14,"I mean, there's as many different variations "
6227.02,on travel as there are individuals out there with roles- 
6230.147,"- Right. - And jobs, et cetera. "
6232.46,"But rather, let's talk about what are the two "
6235.12,or three things that people can do 
6236.72,to adjust their schedule quickly? 
6239.44,"Yesterday, I called you and said, "
6241.347,"""Look, I know somebody who's traveling six hours. "
6244.08,"I won't even mention in which direction, "
6245.49,'cause I don't want people to anchor to that example. 
6248.16,And you described some very simple tools of viewing light 
6253.79,a little bit earlier than normal 
6255.81,"and getting on the local food schedule, et cetera, "
6258.63,that would allow them to shift more quickly. 
6260.802,- Exactly. - And the reason I want to 
6261.635,"have this conversation is yes, for the travelers, "
6263.81,"and for the shift workers, "
6265.84,but mostly because of the fact that you've proven 
6270.2,again and again that people are disrupted 
6273.66,in their circadian behavior at home. 
6276.407,"So, aside from what we've already talked about, "
6279.04,how can one adjust quickly to a new schedule? 
6282.4,"Like let's say, fall classes are starting, "
6284.12,you start a new job or you have a baby 
6285.79,"or a puppy or whatever, what is the best way "
6288.59,to shift the clock quickly? 
6290.22,"- So, it's very simple as we've talked yesterday. "
6292.62,So imagine you're in the outside with no industrial light. 
6299.04,If your body thinks you're in early evening 
6302.1,"and you see a bright light, what does this tell you? "
6304.97,"Oh, wait, this is not early evening yet. "
6307.64,It's still early afternoon or late afternoon. 
6311.2,So I have to delay my clock to go back to late afternoon. 
6314.93,"So if you get light early in the evening, "
6318.17,it delays your clock. 
6320.1,So what does that- - Meaning that makes you 
6321.49,want to go to sleep later? 
6322.9,"- Yes, it delays your clock. "
6324.101,"So, you're in New York, right? "
6327.79,People in Italy have an advanced clock 
6329.78,because they are six hours ahead of us. 
6333.06,So if you're in New York and you get light early 
6336.517,"in the evening, you delay even further from Italy. "
6339.47,So now you're delaying away from Italy. 
6342.1,Now the same thing happens. 
6343.61,"Let's say, you thought dawn came up "
6345.73,"and you thought it's already dawn, "
6347.74,but it was let's say three o'clock in the morning 
6349.83,or four o'clock in the morning. 
6350.86,"And then you get to bright light and you say, "
6352.737,"""Oh, wait a minute. "
6353.84,"Dawn is not the up yet."" "
6355.84,So I should advance my clock. 
6357.43,"Or I'm at night, but I'm getting bright lights, "
6361.46,so I should run because dawn is already up. 
6364.67,"So then later in the night, later in your night, "
6369.27,and actually it just happens that in humans 
6371.95,"you get a temperature nadir later in the night, "
6374.85,low temperature in your body. 
6376.56,"After that, lights start advancing your clock. "
6380.06,"So if you want to go to Italy, "
6381.57,"instead of getting light early in the evening, "
6383.47,you want to get light after the temperature low. 
6386.73,"So you could advance your clock even before you go to Italy, "
6390.06,and you're catching up to the Italians just by using light. 
6392.89,It's as simple as that. - Great. 
6394.42,- So you could do it for every region. 
6396.73,You could calculate how much they are advanced of you. 
6400.01,"You could know how much these light shifts happen per day, "
6402.947,"and you can calculate what you need to do, "
6405.95,"very simple math, to adjust either in direction of delaying "
6409.9,"if you're going from New York to California, "
6411.81,you want to delay your clock 
6413.42,or advancing if you're going from New York to Italy. 
6416.35,"- So, in order to make that a visual "
6418.61,"and because a lot of people are listening to this, "
6420.25,"not looking at it on video, "
6421.85,we will put a zero cost downloadable figure of this 
6427.01,on the HubermanLab.com website related to this episode. 
6430.3,But I think I can summarize it in language as well. 
6434.44,"If I understand correctly, "
6435.53,what you're saying is if your typical wake up time 
6439.12,"is say, "
7:,
00,"a.m., then your low point in temperature "
6443.01,probably occurs somewhere around 
5:,
00,a.m.. 
6445.89,- Yeah. - And if you view light 
6447.67,right around then it's going to essentially 
6450.48,advance your clock. - Yeah. 
6451.76,"Because then your body thinks, oh, it's seven o'clock, "
6454.66,so advanced your clock by one to two hours. 
6457.04,"- But if I were to view light, say at "
3:,
00,"a.m., "
6460.8,then it would probably delay my clock? 
6462.72,- Yeah. - Okay. 
6463.93,"Yeah, so, and then let's say I land in a new schedule. "
6467.22,I want to adjust to a new schedule. 
6468.39,Let's say I didn't manage to do anything 
6470.05,with my light viewing before I went. 
6471.49,And I didn't anticipate the trip. 
6473.53,"Suddenly I'm on a new schedule, okay? "
6476.24,I was told that one of the ways to help shift the clock 
6479.8,and to avoid gastrointestinal issues 
6482.1,is to eat on the local schedule. 
6484.51,- Mm hm. - To start basically behaving 
6487.11,like a local. - Mm hm. 
6488.27,- Even though your circadian clock will take 
6490.74,a little bit of time to catch up. 
6491.607,"- Right, absolutely. "
6492.85,"But you have to remember the light, right? "
6495.41,"So, now that we explained it very simply, "
6497.99,"let's take a very simple example, right? "
6500.85,"New York to Italy, that's a simple example. "
6503.88,"New York time, Italy time, six hour difference, right? "
6506.83,So let's say you fly from New York at night. 
6509.65,You reach Italy at eight o'clock in the morning. 
6511.9,What is the time in your New York time although you- 
6515.51,- Six hours back. - Six hours back. 
6516.343,- It's 
2:,
00,in the morning. - It's 
2:,
00,a.m.. 
6518.54,"So when you land Italy, "
6519.83,you want to avoid light like the plague. 
6522.18,"Yeah, you could eat, "
6523.22,but you really don't want to get the light. 
6524.417,"- Right, 'cause otherwise it's going to delay you. "
6526.32,"- It's going to delay you, it's going to send you to California "
6528.31,instead of sending you to Italy. 
6529.68,"- Right, and so this is such a key point. "
6531.6,"If anyone's confused about this, "
6532.97,we will put some diagrams up. 
6534.31,But what Samer is saying is so crucial. 
6537.77,Just because getting bright light in your eyes 
6540.15,"early in the day is really beneficial when you're at home, "
6542.46,"when you travel to a new time zone, "
6544.97,you have to take into account what your body thinks. 
6550.253,"Excuse me, you have to take into account where "
6552.29,your body thinks you are. - Exactly. 
6553.51,"- And so if you're looking at the Italian sunrise, "
6555.59,having just flown from New York to Italy 
6557.91,and you didn't prepare for that trip by waking up 
6560.05,a little bit earlier in anticipation- 
6561.64,"- Multiple days, yeah. - And you view light "
6565.03,at 
6:,
00,or 
7:,
00,"a.m. Italian time, "
6567.59,"beautiful Italian sunrise, "
6569.4,you are going to delay your clock. 
6571.09,"You're going to basically throw yourself back to California, "
6573.94,but you are in Italy. 
6575.24,You're going to throw your biology back to California 
6577.28,and you are going to be up in the middle of the Italian night. 
6580.05,And you're going to be miserable- - Miserable. 
6582.43,- I'll tell a brief anecdote 
6584.15,'cause I called Samer in desperation. 
6586.77,"A few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi, "
6589.06,"NYU Abu Dhabi to give a seminar, "
12,hours out of phase. 
6592.01,It's a 
12,hour flip. 
6593.09,And I thought I could just muscle it. 
6595.17,"I thought I'll get up, just view sunlight "
6596.91,when the sun comes up and I fell apart 
6600.9,mentally and physically. 
6602.08,And Samer came to my rescue. 
6604.31,"I called him, I said, ""I don't know what to do."" "
6606.07,"And he said, ""Go to the gym at the local dawn, "
6612.58,"workout, eat and then view sunlight starting the next day."" "
6618.38,And that basically got me on the schedule. 
6619.92,So I used food and exercise to adjust myself 
6622.21,because my light viewing activity 
6624.08,was just completely out of whack. 
6625.56,"- Yeah, I mean, and we talked about other details, "
6628.13,"so you have to calculate it, but you're absolutely right. "
6631.07,"I mean, it's very important to avoid getting "
6635.55,the wrong light information when you're trying 
6637.41,to adjust your body because otherwise it shifts you 
6640.108,"to the other cycle, absolutely right. "
6643.23,"- Well, you are one of these people that has such vigor. "
6647.45,It's one of these things where having known you 
6649.67,"all these years, you have a tremendous capacity for work "
6652.76,"and for soccer, and for arguing, respectful arguing. "
6657.02,"And sometimes, you know- - It's getting worse with age. "
6659.9,"- Yeah, well, we could talk about that offline, "
6661.84,but I think a lot of your vigor and a lot of your ability 
6665.44,to work hard and focus and really do so many things 
6668.71,at an impressive level is because you think about 
6671.24,these issues and you think about 
6673.19,"when you're going to be optimal for focus, "
6675.61,"when you're going to be optimal for exercise, "
6678.306,and the when is the key. - Right. 
6680.167,- And I think a lot of people live in the landscape 
6682.49,of feeling like there's something broken inside them 
6685.18,because they can't focus- - It's subconscious. 
6686.58,"- Or they get too- - It's subconscious, right? "
6687.93,Remember it's all subconscious. 
6690.02,"These effects and, Andrew, you're absolutely right. "
6692.16,"Now, honestly, joking aside about age, "
6695.22,I really agree with you that I think part of the reason 
6697.99,"I'm continuing to be able to do this, "
6700.03,that I really think about it. 
6702.15,And I make sure that I keep everything aligned. 
6705.83,And that actually helps me a lot. 
6707.66,Like I don't suffer in sleep. 
6709.93,I don't suffer in waking up. 
6711.17,I never use a timer to wake up. 
6713.6,"I mean, people say, aren't you scared? "
6715.2,Like you have to give a lecture at 
8:,
00,or 
7:,
30.,
6718.15,"Honestly, I was like, there is no way "
6719.5,I'm going to go beyond that. 
6721.11,"It just, even if I try, "
6722.53,I can't sleep beyond 
6:,
00,"a.m. in my regular times, "
6725.7,"it's just, it's not going to happen. "
6727.43,By 
4:,
30,my eyes are wide awake and I'm in bed. 
6730.75,"It's just system is so aligned, it works. "
6735.81,"- A lot of times people will say, how come I go to sleep, "
6738.36,"I fall asleep fine, but then I wake up at "
3:,
00,or 
4:,
00,
6740.6,in the morning and can't fall back asleep. 
6742.77,Is it possible that those people were supposed 
6744.78,to go to bed at 
8:,
00,p.m.? 
6746.36,- It's possible. 
6747.23,"I mean, it is possible. "
6748.8,It is also possible that sometimes people will wake up 
6751.58,and go back to sleep. 
6752.75,"But yeah, I mean, it is possible. "
6755.52,"Or it's possible that their clock is completely misaligned, "
6758.57,that they are getting maybe a nap time at night 
6761.54,when they are supposed... 
6762.373,And then they possibly feel so sleepy in the day. 
6764.45,"So, all these are possible combination. "
6766.92,"- Well, that's an interesting idea I hadn't considered. "
6768.63,"So, that what they think is their sleep, "
6770.74,"their body is so out of whack with the light-dark cycle, "
6773.55,that it's actually a nap. - A nap. 
6775.41,Or the weaker part of the sleep. 
6777.12,"I mean, you see this when you traveled "
6779.84,to different time zone before you adjust. 
6782.25,"You go to sleep really well, "
6783.95,"but two hours later, you're fully up. "
6786.38,Two hours. 
6787.38,"If you were so tired and this is your regular sleep, "
6789.89,there's no way you're going to wake up in two hours. 
6793.31,"So, then you feel very sleepy later in the day "
6796.38,or something like that. 
6797.213,So it depends of how your whole system 
6800.15,is aligned to the environment. 
6801.6,- That's a very interesting idea. 
6804.525,I think that's going to resonate with a lot of people. 
6806.92,I wake up every morning around 
3:,
00,or 
4:,
"00,",
6810.61,I generally use the bathroom 
6812.49,and then I fall back asleep very deeply. 
6814.77,It doesn't seem to disrupt my daytime wakefulness. 
6817.4,And I think a lot of people obsess over that waking up 
6820.39,and worry there's something wrong. 
6821.223,- Absolutely. - Provided they can go back 
6822.7,to sleep it's okay. - Exactly. 
6823.543,"If you can go use the bathroom, go back to sleep, "
6826.07,that should not be a problem. 
6828.17,"Maybe with some people, when they go to use the bathroom, "
6830.063,they use very bright light and then 
6831.52,they get an alerting signal. 
6833.73,"So, maybe it could be as simple as that, that affects you. "
6837.92,"Maybe when you wake up, you put tons of light "
6840.45,or you start reading your iPad. 
6842.49,So there's all these combination that we still don't know 
6845.27,about that could be affecting their sleep-wake rhythms 
6848.08,and their sleep maintenance. 
6850.41,- Do you take melatonin? 
6853.48,- I don't need it to be honest. 
6854.72,"In my case, there is no reason to use it "
6856.93,"because I could guarantee you that by maybe eight o'clock, "
6860.88,my melatonin has already started to go up. 
6863.14,"And by the time I sleep, my melatonin is very high "
6865.64,because I don't use a lot of lights after sunset. 
6869.15,- And light inhibits melatonin release. 
6870.267,- And light really blocks melatonin level. 
6873.51,- You hear this myth that the pineal gland calcifies 
6877.45,as we get older. 
6878.283,Do you know anything about that? 
6879.283,"- I mean, I've heard about that, but I don't know... "
6882.46,"I mean, there is not very clear evidence "
6884.34,that it affects the sleep. 
6885.48,"I don't know much about it, to be honest. "
6887.31,"- Yeah, the evidence that I've seen is that yes, "
6889.13,"there's some calcification around the pineal, "
6891.26,just because of where it sits in the brain. 
6894.71,It's close to some bony structures. 
6897.187,- I see. - But I don't think 
6898.8,there's any evidence that it has negative effects. 
6901.71,"- I mean, if you still have, "
6903.23,you could measure melatonin and that should tell you 
6905.46,"if it has any, it's such an easy thing to do. "
6907.6,"- Yeah, I think this is more of a internet wellness thing "
6911.13,that got outside the cage. - That's possible. 
6914.103,I think you're absolutely right. 
6915.48,"- Yeah, it sounds terrible, calcification "
6918.08,"of the thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. "
6919.79,"Like the heart thing, right? - Yeah, exactly. "
6923.93,Let's talk about seasonality a little bit. 
6927.76,"I learned, and I don't know if this is still true, "
6932.21,"but that most suicides occur in April, in the spring. "
6937.39,"I think there's a poem that says, "
6938.827,"""April is the cruelest month,"" "
6940.51,I think as the poem begins. 
6944.55,Are there data that suicides are more frequent 
6947.26,at particular times of year? 
6948.65,"And if so, is the spring that time of year? "
6950.88,"- Yeah, a lot of people talk about this. "
6953.38,And one of the hypothesis is that the winter month 
6957.08,"that are very bad for mood, "
6959.63,make people not wanting to do anything. 
6962.04,And they get into such deep level of depression 
6965.6,"that when the sun comes up, "
6967.14,"they get actually the energy to act on their depression, "
6970.0,which sounds really terrible. 
6971.503,And it's just terrible. - Sounds just terrible. 
6972.77,It's terrible. - So that's the idea 
6974.76,that the lack of light throughout the winter 
6977.04,caused them to go into such depression 
6979.11,that they don't feel like doing anything. 
6981.72,"Then when the light comes in with rigor in the spring, "
6985.09,"it gives them that after all the depression they suffered, "
6988.25,"it gives them that push to take that sad, final act I guess. "
6994.58,- What other seasonal effects have been 
6996.33,demonstrated in humans? 
6997.49,"- Yeah, I mean, I think in humans, it's not very clear "
7000.5,"because we don't think about seasonality, "
7002.54,"but if you start thinking about us, "
7005.273,I think we go through major seasonal changes. 
7008.05,I really do. 
7008.883,I think our eating pattern changed across the year. 
7011.76,"I could tell you that me thinking about this, "
7014.61,there is a clear changes that happens to me across the year. 
7018.52,"But for animals, this is really essential "
7020.88,because for animals they have to time their mating behavior 
7025.37,was when they deliver their progeny in the most abundant 
7029.39,amount of food and artificial light 
7032.03,is causing major disruption. 
7033.99,Because if you change the way these animals 
7036.63,"are receiving the light information, "
7039.02,they either start mating much earlier or much later 
7042.12,and their numbers dwindle. 
7043.64,And they get into the dangers of really completely 
7047.04,getting eliminated or extinct. 
7049.03,"- Well, human birth rates are definitely going down. "
7051.05,"- Right, in some- - I mean, in the US "
7053.942,"in particular, yeah. - In some areas, not others. "
7055.462,"- Not others, right. "
7058.06,But are there other effects of seasonality on humans 
7061.42,that we are aware of? 
7062.87,"- Honestly, you could see it perfectly, "
7066.098,"I think, in Scandinavia, "
7068.418,"I mean, you could talk to people who live in- "
7071.32,"- Sure, they get seasonal depression. "
7073.05,"- Well, seasonal depression is one, "
7074.66,"but actually when you start asking them questions, "
7077.02,they tell you like in the winter they barely could wake up. 
7080.63,"They barely have the energy, before even depression. "
7083.55,"Even people who don't get seasonal depression, "
7085.96,they will tell you our energy level is lower. 
7088.1,Our ability to go to work is not the same. 
7091.3,"And in the summer, most people actually sleep very little. "
7094.99,"They tell you, we really can feel like we're manic, "
7099.25,"we have all this energy and not in a negative way, "
7102.68,"in a funny way, right? "
7103.72,"I mean, but if we want to sleep, we have to put this curtain. "
7107.08,"And I think in these situations, "
7109.18,you could really appreciate the seasonality of humans. 
7112.6,I think we kind of destroyed our seasonality 
7115.62,because we don't get exposed to that much natural light. 
7119.82,"We have all this artificial light, but I think honestly, "
7123.3,one of the thing that is going to happen 
7125.41,if they follow your recommendations about giving light 
7128.89,"at the same time, giving food, giving exercise- "
7130.66,"- Wait, let's be clear, those are your recommendations. "
7132.843,"- Well, I mean- - No, I mean just "
7134.88,in fair attribution. 
7136.1,- What I'm saying is that this is going to cause them 
7138.54,"to also experience some changes across the season, "
7141.71,because now they're going to see the sun differently. 
7144.95,"If you're going to go out in the morning in the summer, "
7148.15,you're going to get a much brighter... 
7149.53,That's why I don't like the change in time. 
7151.24,"I know people think, oh, because you're biased, "
7154.71,"'cause I think- - Wait, wait, wait, wait. "
7156.08,"Sorry, the change in time, "
7157.095,are you talking about daylight savings? 
7158.42,- Daylight savings. 
7159.253,It's such a bad idea because it disrupts 
7161.79,that rhythm that you're having. 
7164.2,"'Cause I think your body, if you keep that rhythm, "
7167.09,you will see the whole seasonality. 
7168.86,And I look at it from a different aspect than other people. 
7173.05,"And people say I'm biased because I'm a morning person, "
7175.35,"and it may be true, but there are situation- "
7179.03,- Secret conspiracy about morning people. 
7181.08,"- Yeah, but if you think about it, Andrew, "
7183.34,there is a situation where you're getting light 
7186.87,perfectly well and then all of a sudden 
7188.53,they delayed by one hour because... 
7190.69,"And then even though it's the summer, "
7193.07,"your body now, if you're still not adjusting think, "
7195.967,"""Oh wait, what happened? "
7197.34,"What kind of happened?"" "
7198.55,"- Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up "
7199.78,"because I always thought what's the big deal, one hour? "
7203.95,"Right, one hour shift. "
7205.12,"Spring forward, fall back. - It's so hard to adjust "
7206.77,to one hour actually. 
7208.02,- But this goes back to the beginning of our discussion. 
7211.69,It's not just one hour. - Right. 
7213.75,- Because it's one hour across that one day. 
7216.376,- Right. - But there's this cumulative 
7217.39,effect on the clock and these three elements 
7220.66,"of your tripartite model. - Yeah, exactly. "
7222.387,"- Right, the homeostatic, sleep and the light, "
7224.82,direct effects on mood. - Exactly and when 
7226.27,"it's so close, it's sometimes hard to figure out "
7229.65,how to adjust it perfectly because 
7232.29,we're already sleep deprived in our society. 
7234.16,And then you shift it by... 
7236.887,"So it just, it all accumulates and it has no benefit. "
7240.75,"- Well, you work at a major government organization, "
7242.86,National Institute of Mental Health. 
7244.006,- Yeah. - Why don't we campaign for- 
7245.677,"- Honestly, I have no idea. "
7247.62,"I mean, it makes no sense. "
7248.453,"- No, I'm saying why don't we go campaign? "
7250.11,"- Yeah, I would love to. "
7250.943,"I mean, it makes no sense to have the summer light "
7254.47,goes up at 
9:,
00,"p.m., "
7256.44,the light goes down where I live in Baltimore at 
9:,
00,p.m. 
7259.597,"And then all of a sudden, "
7261.36,"when you really want to see the light longer in the day, "
7264.89,you now shift the other way. 
7266.267,And now it goes all of a sudden at 
6:,
00,p.m.. 
7268.117,Why do you do these drastic changes? 
7270.41,"Let it blend across the whole season, you know? "
7274.07,"Yes, later, earlier at night, but it's at least consistent. "
7278.03,It goes in a very consistent manner. 
7280.17,I just don't understand why they do this. 
7282.13,It makes no sense. 
7283.4,"- Well, I think that the reason they do it "
7285.9,is because they don't understand the biology. 
7287.82,"- Exactly, absolutely. - Because one hour seems "
7289.63,trivial unless you understand- - It's not. 
7291.12,"- That the repercussions of that one hour shift, "
7294.53,"because what's also clear now based on what you're saying, "
7297.81,is that that one hour shift taking you out of alignment 
7301.04,with the natural light-dark cycle 
7302.7,in exactly the wrong direction. 
7304.86,- It's pushing people to get even later. 
7307.35,"- Yeah. - In the summer, "
7308.3,when light is going to push you later anyway. 
7311.04,It doesn't make sense. 
7312.2,"You put it beautifully, I just rambled and this is really- "
7315.45,"- No, no, you made it clear. "
7316.413,"- I mean, it's like literally it it made people "
7320.31,who are having problem having an advanced sleep rhythm 
7323.78,"because they are delayed, "
7325.26,now you give them this hour to make them even more delayed. 
7328.16,You push them even later in the day-night cycle. 
7330.88,It just doesn't make sense at all. 
7334.45,- I think 
2022,should be the year that we 
7337.01,"abolish daylight savings. - Oh, man. "
7337.843,That would be the day for me honestly. 
7341.86,"- Well, also, if it has a positive effect "
7344.1,on what is essentially an epidemic of mental health issues 
7348.97,and other issues related to improper interactions 
7351.9,"with light, that I think is a well worthwhile cause, "
7357.23,"and we can explore it. - Absolutely, absolutely. "
7358.94,- [Andrew] So for once we're going to fight with another group. 
7361.805,"- Common, I would do to do that. "
7362.638,- [Andrew] A common battle as opposed to with one another. 
7364.297,"- I mean, the circadian people honestly, "
7365.853,"to give them credit, have been trying for years "
7368.37,to abolish daylight saving. 
7370.02,"- Yeah, the problem is they all go to sleep at "
9:,
00,p.m. 
7372.45,and wake up at 
4:,
00,"a.m., so we never see them. "
7374.41,"- That's right, that's right. "
7375.75,"- No, the circadian community has done an amazing job "
7379.24,of figuring out what we need. - Right. 
7382.88,"- And then the challenge of course, "
7384.36,is making sure that people get what they need. 
7387.14,- Right. - And making sure 
7388.15,"that at a societal level, we're not vaulting ourselves "
7391.67,into the wrong direction. - And the biggest problem 
7393.07,"is that the late waking people, they think that really, "
7398.23,"and I'm going to try to put it in a better way now, "
7400.71,"they think, oh, because you're a morning person, "
7402.73,you want to see the sun early. 
7404.13,"So you want me to suffer it dropping late, "
7407.33,but that's not the case. 
7409.06,Because what happens is when they shift it back 
7412.8,"after the daylight saving, "
7414.67,now they're going to make you suffer really badly 
7416.82,because now it's going to be earlier. 
7419.46,"- Right, in the fall. - In the fall when there "
7421.295,"is not enough light. - Yeah, that's right. "
7422.177,- And they keep it the same way. 
7423.83,So to try to convince them that actually this at the end 
7427.31,causes more trouble when you need the light 
7430.15,"for your late schedule in the fall, "
7432.89,when they shift it back. 
7434.49,"Then they say, keep it daylight saving all the time. "
7437.02,And that has been proven that it's very bad. 
7440.7,Like people have done studies that literally two areas 
7444.03,close to each others and areas that were the whole year 
7447.54,on daylight saving has much more problems 
7450.56,even in cancer rates and depression. 
7452.61,So you don't want to do that. 
7454.13,So that's what trying to convince people 
7456.87,"that you need to prevent that switch, "
7460.27,and you don't need daylight saving at all. 
7462.85,That's where the problem happens. 
7465.1,- Interesting. 
7466.22,"I had not thought about that, but yes, "
7468.33,"you late risers that in the fall, when it's the fall back, "
7472.53,"as they say, spring forward, fall back, "
7473.88,"you dial back the clock, "
7475.28,it's really compounding the problem 
7477.44,that already exists. - Exactly. 
7479.57,"And it's really nice if you think, "
7480.94,"if you keep it consistent in the spring, "
7483.12,"you get the equinox and then the day starts going up, "
7487.95,"and then even in the summer it start going down, "
7489.47,and then the fall you get the other equinox and go back. 
7492.46,"So it's very symmetrical, right? "
7494.66,"It goes into short day, longer, long, long, long, long, "
7497.93,and then short day again. 
7499.47,But now you're getting these bumps in both sides 
7502.4,of the spring and fall. 
7504.17,Why would you do that? 
7505.21,"Something that is beautifully symmetrical, "
7507.49,"beautifully smooth, you're putting bumps into it. "
7510.06,"- Well, and not just beautiful because it's there, "
7513.11,but it evolved. 
7514.9,"I mean, essentially this is the system- "
7515.964,- It's natural. - We evolved in for hundreds 
7517.688,of thousands of years. - This is the seasonality. 
7518.521,"The most even apart from the exact equator, "
7521.33,every part of the earth has seasonality. 
7525.27,- I want to briefly touch on something which is 
7527.87,individual and genetic variation 
7529.76,in the sensitivity to light. - Yeah. 
7531.89,"- So not chronotype, but first of all, "
7535.49,a very basic question. 
7537.58,"Do people with light eyes, light colored eyes, "
7542.25,are they more sensitive to light than people 
7544.23,with darker pigmented eyes? 
7546.05,"- I mean, honestly, it makes sense they will be more "
7548.69,"because if you think of my dark pupil, "
7551.36,it's blocking more light. 
7552.81,"So, if you have light pupil, "
7555.75,"yes, for vision, it may not be very obvious, "
7558.03,"but for something that is measuring the amount of light, "
7560.46,you're getting more light than me. 
7562.43,So you would probably need less light to be effective 
7566.38,as somebody who's darker. 
7568.63,And that maybe could explain why sometimes lighter people 
7571.71,"say, I don't want to go into very bright conditions "
7574.08,"because it's really bright. - Yeah, I can't even "
7577.36,"be at a cafe with one of these reflective tables, "
7579.83,like a metal table. - Right. 
7580.85,- Unless I have very dark sunglasses on. 
7582.681,- Exactly. - It's so bright 
7583.514,"it's painful for me. - Right, right. "
7584.712,"- Whereas some people like you, we've sat outside "
7585.87,and had meals and you're like fine. 
7588.24,I assumed it was kind of Jordanian toughness versus- 
7590.457,"- No, no, no, it's really the pupil blocks more light. "
7593.23,So I think it is possible that it's as simple as the pupil 
7597.05,"blocking more light can have sensitivity, "
7599.093,but your question is also goes deeper. 
7601.52,Are there more sensitivity differences? 
7604.57,"And my understanding would be I would think that it may be, "
7607.93,depends on how effective your cells 
7610.59,"are in responding to light, how healthy your ipRCGs are. "
7616.13,But there's not many studies to show that. 
7618.21,What is really clear that is happening 
7620.45,"is that patients with bipolar, "
7623.54,they seem to have different sensitivities to light. 
7626.07,So it seems that at least people 
7627.97,"who have psychological changes, "
7632.42,"they may have differences to the sensitivity of light, so. "
7637.29,- Are those differences in a particular direction? 
7640.05,- I don't remember the exact data. 
7641.87,"- We can look it up, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. "
7645.47,- And people have heard me say this at nauseum 
7647.47,"to the point where they actually roll their eyes, "
7649.28,"but that these are the only two pieces of brain, "
7652.23,"I'm pointing to my eyes, folks, "
7653.36,that are outside the cranial vault. 
7655.04,- Absolutely. - They are two pieces of brain 
7656.35,that it basically inform the brain about whether 
7659.18,or not to be alert or asleep. - Absolutely. 
7660.97,- But you can imagine that those two little pieces of brain 
7663.12,that we call eyes would have genetic variations. 
7666.753,- Right. - Of course eye color 
7667.586,"is genetically determined, "
7671.56,that there would be genetic variations based on 
7673.75,whether or not your ancestry evolved near the equator 
7676.86,"or further from the equator, right? "
7678.643,"I mean, you see more blue eyes in Scandinavia, "
7681.202,"than you do at the equator. - Absolutely, I mean, "
7682.035,it's the lack of light that said you need less inhibition 
7686.05,"because there's not enough light, right? "
7687.66,So that's the idea of the changing color. 
7691.52,"So, yeah, I totally agree with you. "
7693.72,"I mean, I think this is an area that will be studied later "
7696.88,and will be empirically determined. 
7699.61,"The problem we have in this field right now, "
7702.2,"which I think is the biggest problem, "
7704.41,is we don't have a way to measure the ipRCGs 
7707.77,sensitivities in humans. 
7709.24,"So we still like, it's easy to measure "
7712.1,"your rod cone function if you go to an optometrist, "
7715.09,"they measure all the details, right? "
7717.01,"Contrast detection. - You look at the chart, "
7718.73,"you get out the Snellen Chart. - Yeah, exactly. "
7719.76,- You look at the letters of the DMV. 
7721.43,- Yeah. - Yeah. 
7722.29,"- But for the non subconscious, "
7724.61,we still don't have a good measuring systems to figure out 
7728.88,what is Andrew's sensitivity? 
7730.65,What is Samer's sensitivity? 
7732.05,What is this person's sensitivity? 
7733.48,And I think we're starting to work on something like that 
7736.61,to hopefully develop these techniques. 
7738.44,"But till we develop them, "
7740.3,it's going to be very hard to figure out 
7742.47,if there is a sensitivity difference? 
7744.18,How do they relate? 
7745.31,And on men and woman? 
7748.06,Dark and light? 
7749.4,"And all that, normal versus psychologically affect, "
7753.28,and stuff like that. 
7754.53,- Fascinating. 
7756.15,"And every time you talk, I learn so much. "
7759.98,"It's in the best way, the best sense of the term, "
7764.624,it's a waterfall of knowledge. 
7767.47,"As a final question, "
7768.82,"I have a question about sensitivity of a whole other kind, "
7772.53,and that's the sensitivity to spicy food. 
7776.55,"Now, the reason I'm asking this question, "
7779.01,what seemingly out of the blue is that I made the mistake 
7782.62,once of having Samer cook for me. 
7785.34,"And I said, ""Not too spicy."" "
7788.46,"And he said, ""Okay, not too spicy."" "
7790.67,"He actually said, ""Okay, not too spicy."" "
7792.6,And it almost killed me. 
7795.74,Like it was like two or three days. 
7797.98,"So you know a lot about biology outside the visual system, "
7801.97,"light, et cetera. "
7802.9,You've been around a while. 
7805.42,Are there known genetic or inherited of any kind 
7809.75,sensitivities to spicy food? 
7812.27,To things like red peppers and capsaicin? 
7814.24,"Because what you call mild, my friend, "
7818.07,almost put me into the hospital. 
7820.48,- I think this is similar to you swimming in the ocean 
7823.05,and I need to go develop the pain tolerance to do it. 
7824.38,"- Okay, true, true, I like cold water swims "
7826.66,and Samer's not a fan. - Yeah. 
7827.75,- But that's going to change. 
7829.314,It's adaptable. - These are adaptable. 
7831.514,- That's going to change. - That's my belief. 
7832.74,"Before I met Rejji, I was like you. "
7834.78,"And once I started eating a lot of spicy food, "
7837.51,I lost touch of how spicy my food is. 
7840.61,"So I nearly killed you, Andrew, and I apologize for that. "
7843.26,- I forgive you. 
7844.093,"So, basically what you're saying is that marriage "
7845.5,"toughened you up? - Toughened me up, exactly. "
7848.26,- [Andrew] Maybe that's the solution. 
7849.22,"- That's what you need, yeah. "
7851.42,"- Samer, this has been an amazing march "
7855.29,"through the importance of light, "
7857.3,"not just for regulating sleep and wakefulness, "
7859.56,"but also for food timing, the interactions with mood, "
7863.6,the interactions with exercise. 
7865.61,I'm certain that people are going to start thinking about 
7869.07,how to change their relationship with light 
7871.28,as a way to anchor everything that they do. 
7874.74,And that's important to their health. 
7876.15,"And I just on behalf of all of them, "
7878.31,and just directly from me as your friend 
7880.83,"and as a colleague for many years now, I just want to say, "
7884.1,thank you for the incredible work you're doing 
7886.21,and for sharing it with us. 
7887.63,- Thank you so much. 
7888.463,"And I actually now thinking about all of this, and you said, "
7891.71,I should write a book. 
7892.66,"I should write a book and call it ""The Tripartite Model."" "
7895.67,"I think that would put all these components together, "
7898.36,it would be very interesting to do at some point. 
7901.44,- You should write a book. 
7903.36,"They'll probably try and change the title to like, "
7905.117,"""Food, Mood and You,"" or something. "
7908.78,But you can put in little print The Tripartite Model 
7911.24,"or whatever, but regardless of what it's called, "
7915.26,you absolutely should write a book. 
7917.06,"And so if you'd like Samer to write a book, "
7920.48,"or if you'd like to learn more about him, "
7921.82,let's talk a little bit about where people can find you. 
7923.81,Your laboratory is at the National Institutes 
7925.26,of Mental Health. 
7926.4,"He is Head of the Chronobiology Unit, "
7928.0,"all these things as I've mentioned earlier, "
7930.03,but you are active on Twitter and Instagram. 
7933.51,"- Right. - So, what is your "
7935.09,Twitter handle? - It's @SamerHattar. 
7938.2,- And we will provide a link for that in the show notes. 
7941.82,"- Yes, the Twitter @SamerHattar, "
7943.726,and I think the same for Instagram. 
7945.34,"Yeah, actually. - And Samer has been "
7947.62,"coaxed onto Instagram, so he does post from time to time, "
7950.44,"mostly pictures of food that is incredibly spicy, "
7955.1,but also information about chronobiology. 
7957.89,He comes on for an Instagram Live every once 
7959.78,in a while with me. 
7961.01,"So, definitely give him a follow there and on Twitter. "
7964.223,And I'm sure that he'll be happy to answer questions 
7969.054,and entertain any and all discussions about chronobiology. 
7973.76,"- Absolutely, yeah. "
7974.82,"And light, yeah. "
7977.29,"- Great, thank you, Samer. "
7978.36,"- Awesome, thank you, Andrew. "
7979.92,- Thank you for joining me for my conversation 
7982.23,with Dr. Samer Hattar.
