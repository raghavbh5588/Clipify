0.0,ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the,"Huberman Lab podcast, where"
2.458,we discuss science and science
based,tools for everyday life.
6.421,[MUSIC PLAYING]
9.13,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
and,I'm a professor
10.9,of neurobiology
and,ophthalmology
13.06,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.77,Today we are
discussing,creativity.
17.23,Creativity is a topic that to
many,people is very abstract.
21.31,"That is, we know when something"
seems,"creative, some of us"
25.33,know people who are creative
or,"perhaps are creative,"
28.57,and yet the ability to be
creative,resides in everybody.
32.619,And we know that because
the,neural circuits
34.72,that underlie creativity
have,been somewhat defined
38.2,and the steps and processes
within,the brain and body that
41.08,lead to creativity
are,well known.
43.57,"That said, most people don't"
know,how to access creativity.
47.45,And if they do know how
to,"access creativity,"
49.66,they are only able
to,access creativity
51.61,in a fairly limited
number,of domains of life.
54.04,"For instance, in the visual arts"
or,in music or within science
58.75,or engineering or any number
of,different domains ranging
62.08,from the kitchen to sport
to,childhood interactions.
67.21,"That is, childhood games."
69.14,"In other words, some"
adults,are able to access
71.35,their creative spirit when
engaging,in childlike play
74.14,with children or for
that,matter with adults.
77.23,"But as it turns out,"
all,of creativity
79.99,stems from just a small
subset,of neural structures
82.6,in the brain that
need,to be activated
84.85,in a particular
sequence,or order.
86.68,Today we will talk about what
those,"neural structures are,"
89.17,what particular order they need
to,be activated in in order
92.38,"to come up with, for instance,"
new,"ideas that are creative,"
95.65,and then how to implement
those,creative strategies.
99.13,We will also talk
about,different ways
100.93,to access creativity
that,include--
103.24,narrative and storytelling as
well,as applying new rule sets
107.26,or even entirely new worldviews.
109.12,And we will do this in
a,structured way that
111.55,"will allow anyone, whether"
or,not you consider yourself
114.07,creative or not to
be,able to apply
116.74,these tools in different domains
of,"life-- work, family, play,"
120.55,and on and on.
121.66,By the end of
today's,"episode, you"
123.22,will have a better understanding
of,what creativity is
126.73,and how to access it.
128.479,And if you like to bring others
into,your creative endeavors
132.61,which as you'll soon
learn,can massively
135.43,expand the extent to
which,you yourself
137.77,can express your
creative,talents.
139.69,As is the case with all episodes
of,"the Huberman Lab podcast,"
142.93,today we will discuss
both,scientific mechanisms
145.63,and nomenclature.
146.56,And I promise to make
all,of that clear to you
148.483,even if you don't have
a,background in biology
150.4,or psychology.
151.63,"But we will also, of"
"course,",discuss tools.
153.97,"That is, specific steps"
that,you can take in order
156.31,to be more creative.
157.42,One particular tool that I'm
excited,to share with you
159.91,"involves a meditation, but this"
is,a very unusual meditation.
163.81,This is not sitting with eyes
closed,focusing on your breath
166.66,or focusing on a chime
or,some other feature
169.6,in your sensory environment
or,even in your body.
171.97,Later we will talk about
open,monitoring meditations.
175.75,Open monitoring meditations are
very,distinct from other forms
179.08,of meditation and
involve,learning
181.51,how to sit back
and,simply observe
184.09,your thoughts
while,intentionally
186.7,varying where your thoughts go.
188.69,So for those of you
that,find it a struggle
191.17,to focus or to refocus in more
traditional,forms of meditation
194.98,or maybe even in your work
and,even for those of you that
197.92,may suffer from things
like,"ADHD or similar,"
201.67,open monitoring meditation can
be,an extremely valuable tool
205.21,for accessing your
creative,abilities.
206.973,Because of the
ways,that it allows
208.39,you to tap into
specific,circuits
210.4,within the frontal
networks,"of your brain,"
212.18,so these are networks
of,the brain that
213.805,include the areas just
behind,your forehead
216.4,and that allow you to evaluate
new,and novel rule sets
220.51,in a very unconstrained way.
221.892,Because if you think
about,"it, creativity"
223.6,is really the ability to
take,existing elements
226.12,from the physical world or from
the,"thought world, if you will,"
230.05,"or from any domain of life,"
"mood,","thinking, and information"
234.85,and to reorder those into
novel,combinations that
238.0,are useful for something.
239.71,And as we'll also
find,"out later,"
241.27,creativity has this
incredible,"aspect to it,"
243.8,which is that when we see or
create,or experience something
248.38,"that is truly creative,"
it,reveals to us something
251.8,fundamental about the way
that,the natural world
254.44,and indeed the way
that,our brains work.
256.959,If that sounds very mysterious
and,"abstract to you now,"
259.3,I promise that by the
end,"of today's episode,"
261.529,you will not only
understand,what that means
263.47,but you will also understand
how,to use open monitoring
266.32,meditations as well as other
forms,of tools in order
269.86,to access your creative ability.
271.45,"Before we begin, I'd"
like,to emphasize
273.162,that this podcast is separate
from,my teaching and research
275.62,roles at Stanford.
276.64,It is however part of
my,desire and effort
278.74,to bring zero cost to
consumer,information
280.69,about science and
science,related tools
282.64,to the general public.
283.84,In keeping with
that,"theme, I'd like"
285.34,to thank the sponsors
of,today's podcast.
287.75,Our first sponsor is ROKA.
289.39,ROKA makes eyeglasses
and,sunglasses
291.55,that are the absolute
highest,quality.
293.463,The company was founded by
two,All-American swimmers
295.63,from Stanford and everything
about,ROKA eyeglasses
298.27,and sunglasses were designed
with,performance in mind.
301.117,I've spent a lifetime
working,on the biology
302.95,of the visual system.
303.77,And I can tell you that
your,visual system has
305.687,to contend with an enormous
number,of challenges for you
308.087,to be able to see clearly.
309.17,"For instance, when you move from"
a,shady area to a sunny area.
312.23,There are all
adaptations,that have
313.82,to occur in your eye and brain.
315.44,ROKA understands
these,adaptations.
317.96,And the other ones
required,to see clearly.
319.87,And those are built into the
engineering,of their sunglasses
322.37,and eyeglasses.
323.24,One of the things that makes
ROKA,eyeglasses in sunglasses
325.79,"so terrific, is that they"
are,extremely lightweight.
328.167,"In fact, most of the"
time,I don't even
329.75,realize that they're on my face.
331.083,I wear sunglasses when
I,drive and whenever
333.02,I need to throughout the day
and,I wear readers at night.
335.75,I do not wear sunglasses when I
get,"my morning sunlight, which"
339.29,I do every single morning
as,you should be doing also
342.5,as is covered many
times,on this podcast.
344.6,ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
are,also unique in that
347.27,unlike a lot of so-called
performance,eyeglasses
349.34,out there.
350.12,They don't make you
look,like a cyborg.
351.77,They have some of
the,styles that
353.06,"make you look like a cyborg,"
if,that's your thing.
355.143,But if you want to wear
glasses,or sunglasses out
358.28,to dinner or around
for,"social reasons,"
360.98,they have many different
aesthetic,styles
362.75,to choose from.
363.5,If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses,"or sunglasses,"
365.75,"go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A"
.com,and enter the code
369.05,Huberman to save
20%,off your order.
371.33,"Again, that's ROKA, roka.com"
and,enter the code Huberman
375.11,at checkout.
375.71,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Thesis.
378.2,Thesis makes custom nootropics.
380.24,And as you may have
heard,"me say before,"
381.95,I am not a fan of
the,word nootropics
383.9,because it means smart drugs.
385.28,"And frankly, there"
is,no neural circuit
387.38,in the brain for being
quote,"unquote ""smart."""
390.08,There are neural
circuits,for focus.
391.64,There are neural circuits
for,task switching.
393.68,There are neural circuits
for,"today's topic,"
396.36,which is creativity.
397.97,Nootropics therefore
is,not a great word
400.7,to describe any
supplement,or drug that
403.22,can enhance brain function
because,it lacks specificity.
406.55,Thesis understands
this,and therefore has
408.68,designed custom nootropics
that,are tailored
410.99,to your specific needs and that
allow,you to enter the brain
414.29,and bodily states that are
optimal,"for things like focus,"
416.99,"energy, creativity, and so on."
419.29,If you'd like to try your own
personalized,nootropic starter
421.79,"kit, go online to take"
thesis.com/Huberman.,
424.79,Take their brief
three,minute quiz.
426.29,And Thesis will send you
four,different formulas
428.29,to try in your first month.
429.44,"Again, that's take"
thesis.com/huberman,and use
432.44,the code Huberman at checkout
for,10% off your first box.
435.68,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by LMNT.
438.085,LMNT is an
electrolyte,drink that
439.46,contains everything you need
that,"is sodium, magnesium,"
443.04,and potassium in
the,precise ratios
444.92,that you need without sugar.
447.02,As I talked about many
times,before on this podcast
449.15,"and elsewhere, every"
cell,in your body
451.64,requires hydration
and,electrolytes
454.04,in order to function properly.
455.45,And a key example of this are
the,"neurons, the nerve cells"
457.943,of your brain that allow
you,"to think clearly,"
459.86,"to exercise hard, et cetera."
462.2,Neurons require sodium
in,order to fire
464.455,what are called
action,potentials
465.83,or electrical signaling
between,neurons.
467.93,And they require
potassium,and magnesium.
469.85,And those have to be present
in,the correct ratios in order
472.73,for your brain and body
to,function optimally.
474.86,LMNT is formulated
to,help anyone
476.66,with their electrolyte needs.
477.92,And is perfectly suited
to,anyone following
480.56,"a ketogenic, low carbohydrate,"
or,"Paleolithic diet,"
483.41,or a basic omnivore diet which
is,the one that I follow.
486.68,"If you'd like to try LMNT,"
you,can go to drink element
489.11,that's lmnt.com/huberman to
claim,a free element sample
493.1,pack with your purchase.
494.24,And right now LMNT has
two,special flavors
496.16,for the holidays--
chocolate,caramel and mint
498.53,"chocolate, which I should"
mention,taste especially good
501.41,if you actually heat it up.
503.01,So if you treat it
like,"a tea, it works."
505.82,Or if you drink it
cold,it's delicious.
507.59,All the flavors of
LMNT,I find delicious.
510.0,"Again, you can go"
to,"drink element,"
511.76,that's lmnt.com/Huberman.
514.61,The Huberman Lab
podcast,is now partnered
516.409,with Momentous supplements.
517.58,To find the supplements we
discuss,on the Huberman Lab
519.83,"podcast, you can go to"
livemomentous,spelled
522.049,"O-U-S, livemomentous/huberman."
525.01,And I should just
mention,that the Library
526.76,of those supplements is
constantly,expanding.
528.89,"Again, that's"
livemomentous.com/huberman.,
531.95,Let's talk about creativity.
533.66,"Now on the face of it, the word"
creativity,and creative acts
537.32,might seem somewhat
abstract,to us.
539.27,"That is, we know"
when,we see something
541.67,that we consider creative and
we,know when we see something
545.3,that is not creative.
546.74,Things that aren't
creative,are things
548.33,"that we see every day, a car"
with,"four tires, for instance,"
551.66,a bicycle with two
"tires,",not creative.
555.23,"However, we also see things that"
are,novel that are different
559.013,and that we don't really
think,of as creative.
560.93,"In fact, they can be"
downright,trivial.
563.12,"For instance, if I were"
to,take a fish tank
565.61,"and put wings on it,"
that's,a novel combination
569.69,"of things, which is"
one,of the key criteria
572.36,for an act or an object
or,a piece of music
576.62,that is creative.
577.76,"And yet, neither of"
us,I believe would
580.52,find it very creative
or,very interesting
582.74,that a fish tank
has,wings on it.
584.12,Why or why not I should say?
586.44,"Well, it turns out"
that,for something
588.47,to be creative it actually
has,to reveal to us something
591.08,fundamental about the
world,or about how we work.
594.81,And I must say that oftentimes
the,most creative and the most
598.34,interesting and the most
beloved,creative acts
601.52,reveal to us something
fundamental,about the world
603.95,or the way that we work in a
way,that delights and thrills
606.83,and surprise prizes us but
that,we aren't even aware what
609.95,that fundamental rule is.
611.208,I'll return to this
in,a few minutes.
612.75,"But for the time being,"
let's,just build up
616.01,from first principles what
constitutes,something creative
618.71,and what does not constitute
something,creative.
622.154,Creativity is a way of
interacting,with the world
624.98,or combining or recombining
things,in the world
627.53,in a way that appears novel
to,us and to other people.
631.64,My example of a fish tank
with,wings on it is novel.
635.57,"But frankly, it's"
not,very creative
637.37,and it's not very interesting.
639.02,It doesn't reveal
anything,new to us.
641.72,Sure there are flying fish
although,"they just jump far,"
644.81,they don't really fly.
646.02,"And as a consequence,"
putting,wings on a fish tank
648.92,could be used as a metaphor for
the,fact that fish don't fly.
651.643,But you already
knew,and I already
653.06,knew that fish don't fly.
654.44,And so there's
nothing,novel revealed
656.18,to us about the world except
something,we already knew.
659.27,"Now, creative acts on the"
other,"hand, of course,"
662.15,involve novel combinations
of,existing rule sets that
666.02,could be different combinations
of,music or colors or shapes
669.08,"or technology, et cetera."
672.41,But it does so in a way
that,tells us something
675.35,fundamental and different.
677.33,Let me give an example of a few
truly,creative artistic acts.
681.53,And I'll do that in the domain
of,"visual arts but, of course,"
685.393,there are many
examples,that could
686.81,come from music or from other
domains,"sport, et cetera."
690.23,The examples I'll give rather
than,a fish tank with wings
693.59,"are for instance, the"
comparison,between a drawing
698.39,or a very accurate painting
of,"a face, an Escher"
704.06,"painting, and a Banksy."
706.79,If you don't know what
those,are I'll explain.
709.31,"First of all, let's talk about"
an,accurate representation
712.43,of a face.
713.21,If I were to sit
you,down or if you
714.92,were to send me a
photograph,and then
716.9,I were to paint
or,draw a picture
719.03,of your face in a way that
faithfully,"represented,"
722.21,the position and shape of your
nose,"relative to the eyes,"
725.18,maybe a curl of the
"lip,",maybe a few hairs
729.41,of your eyebrows in a
particular,"way, that"
731.66,really captured you accurately.
734.06,I think most people would
"say,","OK, it's accurate."
736.97,It looks a lot like the
photograph,or the person.
739.04,And on the one hand why
that,could be interesting
742.31,it's not particularly
creative,because it faithfully
744.95,represents what's already there.
747.77,"In contrast, a painting or"
a,"picture like an Escher,"
751.28,and for those of you that aren't
familiar,with Escher's involves
754.31,a lot of repeating patterns.
755.58,"So for instance, a bird image"
that's,repeated over and over
758.54,and over and over
"again,",sometimes
760.13,in partially overlapping manner.
762.47,And perhaps a building
that's,repeated over and over
765.47,and over again or stones
repeated,over and over again
767.78,or staircases over
and,over again.
770.27,Escher's capture elements
from,the outside world
774.62,"and faithfully represent them,"
but,faithfully represent them
777.62,"over and over and over again,"
which,is not typically seen
780.23,in the natural world.
781.14,"In fact, most of what"
our,visual system does
783.83,is to eliminate repetitive
patterns,when we see them.
787.02,"In fact, most of what"
our,visual system does
788.96,is try and make us blind
to,repetitive patterns
791.45,in our visual
environment,and only
793.43,allow us to see things
that,are unusual
795.65,in that visual environment.
797.27,"Now, this is especially"
true,at visual scales.
801.092,What I mean by that is if
you,were to go to the beach
803.3,and lie on your towel and
look,"down at the sand,"
805.55,you would start to notice
that,"the sand is a very, very"
808.34,repetitive pattern.
809.18,So at very small scales and in
particular,at molecular scales
812.15,when you get down to the
level,"of atoms and so forth,"
814.97,everything is repetitive.
816.075,"It's the same thing,"
is,just reproduced
817.7,in different combinations
over,and over again.
819.32,But as we move
through,"our world,"
820.61,typically we're not looking
down,at pebbles on the ground
822.985,or little grains of sand
or,the pattern of leaves
826.73,in a particular clover or
something,of that sort.
828.973,Most of the time
we're,looking out
830.39,on landscapes or at
people's,"faces, et cetera."
832.94,And very seldom do we see
highly,repetitive patterns
837.41,at that scale.
838.65,So what Escher's do
is,they essentially
840.8,reveal to us a
fundamental,feature
842.81,about the way that our
visual,"system works,"
844.98,which is that repetitive
patterns,tend to become noise
849.17,in our visual system.
850.1,"That is, our brain encodes"
repetition,as things
853.16,not to be interested in.
854.69,And the things that stand
out,against that repetition
857.18,as the things to be interested
in,so-called signal to noise.
860.45,What Escher's do is they invert
the,relationship between signal
863.66,and noise and they make the
repetitive,patterns the signal
866.72,and the unusual
patterns,the noise.
869.54,"In fact, in every Escher"
there,are unusual patterns
871.76,and those completely
disappear,to us.
873.56,"Now, when you look at an"
"Escher,",what you probably see
875.81,and what I see are just a bunch
of,birds repeated over and over
878.435,again or buildings or staircases
repeated,over and over again.
881.17,And you may like
Escher's,"and you may not,"
882.92,that's not the point.
883.88,Today we're not
talking,about taste
885.5,in particular creative acts.
887.12,What we're trying
to,identify here
888.8,are the rules and mechanisms
of,what constitutes something
891.65,creative and why it's creative.
893.42,And the key element here is that
what's,revealed by an Escher
896.87,through these
repetition,patterns
899.36,is an inversion of the way
that,our brain normally
901.55,encodes visual images.
902.96,"And therefore, the"
rule,that repetition
906.11,is suppressed in
our,visual system
908.78,and that unusual visual features
are,"revealed to us, that rule"
914.48,is what pops out to us
when,we look at an Escher.
916.853,"Now, when I say pops out I don't"
mean,that you look at an Escher
919.52,"and go oh, normally I"
don't,"see repetition,"
921.59,normally I see the unusual
"stuff,","et cetera, et cetera."
924.2,But there seems to be something
about,truly creative acts
927.26,that capture the attention.
929.03,And sometimes the delight
of,"many, many people"
931.67,is that they reveal a
fundamental,rule about how
934.34,the brain or the world works.
936.3,Let me give you a
different,example
938.46,also from the visual art world.
940.29,Let me give you the
example,of Banksy.
942.11,Banksy is an artist that many of
you,are probably familiar with
945.5,and probably some of you
are,not familiar with.
947.69,So for those of you that are
not,"familiar with Banksy,"
949.94,Banksy is an artist
that,most often
952.49,does two dimensional artwork.
953.9,So these would be stencils
or,paintings or drawings
956.75,like many artists and does
them,"in an urban landscape,"
959.93,an actual city or
suburban,landscape.
963.41,"That is, he draws or stencils or"
graffiti,"in a very cryptic way,"
968.04,I should say.
968.84,No one really knows who Banksy
is,or when he does his art.
971.54,He just reveals his
art,by putting it up.
973.25,But he does this in
the,context of cities
975.8,and on three
dimensional,objects.
977.64,So a good example would be he
will,stencil next to a phone
981.62,booth a police officer.
983.39,Or he will graffiti next
to,an actual fire hydrant
987.23,a dog lifting its leg to
urinate,on that fire hydrant.
990.56,"Now, what's interesting about"
Banksy's,is not simply the fact
994.67,that he puts two dimensional art
onto,three dimensional surfaces
997.97,in the urban and
suburban,landscape
1000.03,because if you think
about,"it, that's been"
1001.78,"done many, many times before."
1003.07,All graffiti is that.
1004.45,All City Art and murals is that.
1008.05,So what's unique about Banksy?
1009.88,What's unique about
Banksy,or I should
1012.76,"say Banksy's, the actual"
"art,",is that he combines
1016.66,two dimensional art with a three
dimensional,landscape in a way
1021.34,that the concept
pops,out at you.
1024.292,What do I mean by that?
1025.25,"Well, in the case of"
the,dog lifting its leg
1027.083,"to urinate on the fire hydrant,"
that's,a scene that most people
1029.77,"and in fact, most children are"
familiar,with from cartoons
1032.2,or from our basic understanding
of,the stereotype of dogs
1034.575,and I must tell you having
owned,"a male dog, a bulldog"
1037.66,Costello for many years.
1040.089,Hydrants were a particular
target,for Costello.
1042.595,"Of course, everything"
was,a particular target
1044.47,for Costello urinating outdoors.
1046.569,"Nonetheless, he liked"
to,pee on fire hydrants.
1049.33,That itself is not interesting.
1051.1,Seeing a photograph of
a,dog raising its leg
1053.65,to pee on a fire hydrant
is,not interesting.
1057.04,Seeing a painting of
that,isn't interesting.
1059.8,Seeing an actual dog
urinating,on a fire hydrant
1062.2,isn't interesting.
1063.16,"In fact, seeing a painting in"
two,dimensions of a dog raising
1067.87,"its leg to, of course,"
it,can't actually
1070.51,urinate but give you the
impression,that it would
1073.33,urinate on that fire
hydrant,isn't particularly
1075.85,interesting except for the fact
that,it reveals to us something
1078.58,"fundamental, which"
is,that we tend
1080.32,to pair visual relationships
between,different objects
1084.1,that share a common
theme,and then
1086.62,the theme tends to pop out us.
1087.975,"So, for instance,"
the,dog raising
1089.35,its leg next to a
fire,hydrant even
1090.928,if the dog is drawn
in,two dimensions
1092.47,and the fire hydrant
is,in three dimensions
1094.39,allows the concept of
dog,and fire hydrant
1097.12,"to emerge or pop out at us,"
which,reveals to us something
1100.21,fundamental about
how,"our brain works,"
1102.08,which is that our brain encodes
concepts,and entire stories
1105.91,as symbols of interaction
between,different objects.
1109.583,Let me give you a
different,example just
1111.25,to make sure that
this,hits home.
1113.86,One of Banksy's more
famous,paintings
1116.05,is a rather politically
charged,"one,"
1118.06,which is of a girl holding
a,bouquet of balloons.
1122.65,And this two dimensional drawing
was,put on to the West wall
1127.21,dividing territories
in,the Middle East.
1130.03,A very controversial issue.
1131.752,The controversies
of,that issue are
1133.21,not what I want to get into.
1134.2,But I don't think
anyone,would doubt
1135.76,that is a controversial issue.
1138.1,The two dimensional
drawing,of the girl
1139.9,with the balloons
on,the actual wall
1143.05,turns out to be quite
interesting,as an art piece
1146.92,because what it reveals to
us,is the entire controversy
1150.4,around the presence of
that,wall and the desire
1152.86,for certain people to breach
that,wall and the desire
1155.23,for other people to insist
that,that wall not be breached
1157.967,for whatever reason.
1158.8,"Again, this is not about"
the,"particular controversy,"
1161.08,the point is that a two
dimensional,image combined
1164.08,with a three
dimensional,structure
1165.88,allows the purpose of that
three,dimensional structure.
1169.96,And the controversy around that
three,dimensional structure
1172.75,to pop out at us in a way that
"if,","for instance, we had just"
1176.47,seen a photograph of
somebody,next to that wall
1179.65,or with a ladder
or,if we just seen
1181.6,a drawing of a girl holding
a,bouquet of balloons
1185.86,on a drawing of that
wall,to not emerge.
1188.47,"In other words, it captures"
two,fundamental features
1190.715,of the visual system.
1191.59,Our ability to encode
things,in two dimensions
1193.81,and understand symbols.
1195.16,And our ability to understand
things,in three dimensions.
1197.855,"And in particular, the wall"
as,a three dimensional object
1200.23,is really interesting
because,it's
1202.45,an actual physical barrier.
1204.11,So showing it as the
actual,physical barrier
1206.23,"that it is in real space,"
in,three dimensions
1209.17,turns out to allow the
interaction,between those two
1212.3,things.
1212.8,"The concept, the controversy"
to,pop out at us and make us
1216.61,think about that particular
controversy,and perhaps
1218.8,where we each individually
stand,on that controversy.
1221.98,"Now, there are many"
examples,of what I just
1224.26,gave in the visual domain.
1226.12,"For instance, Rothko's"
which,are just
1228.7,color on Canvas are
particularly,interesting source
1232.3,of information about the way
that,the brain encodes color.
1235.03,Later I'll fill in exactly
what,that information is.
1237.7,You may like
"Rothko's,",you may not.
1239.233,But I'll tell you one thing.
1240.4,When you look at
a,"Rothko, you are"
1242.95,seeing colors in a
very,different way
1245.11,than you would ever see
colors,in any other context.
1247.87,The fact that they don't
have,a frame typically
1250.36,and the fact that
there's,no white canvas
1253.78,allows the colors
that,you see to be
1255.85,novel hues of those
colors,that you will not
1258.49,see in any other context.
1260.29,And in doing so
reveals,to you what
1263.62,your brain does in order to
understand,and extract color.
1267.58,Now in the context of
"music,","for instance,"
1269.8,you will sometimes hear a
street,musician play a song
1273.28,maybe a Bob Dylan song or a Led
Zeppelin,song or a Pink Floyd
1276.13,"song pretty closely, pretty"
accurately,to the way
1278.987,that song is played.
1279.82,"But, of course,"
that's,not creative.
1280.87,That's just like the photograph
or,the accurate portrait
1283.203,of somebody's face.
1284.05,Or you may hear an
acoustic,version
1286.0,of what's normally an electric
guitar,song or electrical song
1289.51,or vise versa.
1290.59,"Somewhat creative,"
sometimes,sounds
1292.48,even better than the original
but,not particularly creative.
1295.03,"However, each and"
every,one of us
1297.31,has a particular taste in music.
1298.93,"Maybe it's classical, maybe"
it's,"rock, maybe it's punk,"
1301.222,maybe it's hip hop.
1302.43,Within each of those
"genres,",I think all of us
1305.07,are familiar with hearing
something,for the first time
1308.52,and maybe even every time.
1310.11,And there's something
about,the combination
1312.42,of the words and the
music,or sometimes
1315.15,just the music or just the words
that,allows some feature of it
1318.78,to pop out at us as
particularly,exciting.
1322.17,And when we feel that
excitement,and we
1323.91,feel that it's
really,"novel, it's"
1325.47,different than what we've
heard,"before, I assure you"
1327.78,what it's revealing
to,you is the way
1330.12,that your auditory
system,and often
1332.01,your auditory and
your,emotional system
1334.11,encodes information
that,you hear.
1336.96,"And again, the rule"
that,it's revealing
1339.51,is not splayed out for you.
1341.53,"For instance, it's"
not,told to you
1343.02,"oh, this is the way"
you,normally hear
1344.37,and now you're hearing
things,differently.
1345.99,Sometimes it's the
change,in for instance
1347.7,in the way that
words,are accented
1349.2,or the way the sentences
are,constructed.
1351.21,This often you'll hear
in,hip hop the way
1352.95,that sentences are
constructed,can be divided up
1355.74,not as normal declarative
sentences,the way
1357.668,that they're typically written.
1358.96,But the way that sentences
are,chopped up and fractured
1361.86,reveals to us new meaning
and,"in fact, enhanced"
1364.492,meaning about particular
words,that we wouldn't
1366.45,see if it was written
out,as a paragraph
1368.2,and then sung as a script that
would,be the same as the one
1370.81,that we would read.
1371.61,"Again, the point is that what"
is,exciting and novel to you is
1375.66,just the way that you hear it.
1376.95,But it's exciting
and,novel to you
1378.6,because there are circuits
within,the brain that when
1382.08,we hear or see or
feel,or experience
1386.4,known elements in new ways
that,"are truly creative,"
1390.78,the way that those neural
circuits,function is changed.
1394.83,And when neural
circuits,change the way
1397.11,that they function
simply,by way of what
1399.57,"comes into our eyes,"
our,"ears, and the way"
1401.55,that we experience
our,"feelings, there"
1403.95,is the release of
"chemicals,",including
1405.66,the release of the
chemical,dopamine
1407.19,and other
neuromodulators,as well
1409.14,that make us feel both
"surprised,",delighted.
1412.18,"And this is very key,"
excited,in anticipation
1415.89,that we might see it again.
1417.605,So with the
understanding,in mind
1418.98,that true creativity
involves,the l combination
1421.8,of some elements could be notes
of,"music, could be numbers,"
1426.45,could be visual elements
like,"lines or colors,"
1429.21,could be physical
"movements,",et cetera.
1431.52,But novel combinations
of,some things
1434.58,that reveal to us something
fundamental,about the way
1438.03,that our brain and/or
the,world work.
1440.47,"And of course, as"
I,"mentioned before,"
1442.65,that fundamental
thing,may or may not
1444.78,be consciously accessible to us.
1447.06,We may not know what exactly
it,is that's novel to us.
1450.9,But it feels novel
and,it feels true.
1454.62,"Well, with that"
understanding,"in mind,"
1456.36,"we therefore can ask,"
what,are the underlying
1459.33,principles and
neural,circuits that
1461.4,underlie the creative process.
1463.41,And the word process here
is,especially important.
1466.45,"In fact, if there's"
one,thing I'd really
1468.3,like to impress on
everybody,is that when
1470.91,"thinking about biology,"
it's,almost always better
1474.09,to think about verbs
as,opposed to nouns.
1476.49,So rather than
think,of creativity
1478.32,as a noun or somebody being
creative,"as an adjective,"
1481.83,think about the verb creativity.
1483.57,That is what are
the,steps required
1485.82,and therefore what are the
cells,"and circuits and thoughts,"
1488.29,et cetera required in
order,to be creative.
1492.15,This element of
thinking,about verbs
1494.91,"then allows us to say, OK, what"
are,the various steps in coming
1498.51,"up with a creative idea,"
in,"testing a creative idea,"
1501.93,and then implementing
that,creative idea.
1504.18,"And in doing so, we find based"
on,the scientific literature
1507.66,that there are basically
three,major networks
1509.97,"within the brain, each of"
which,is responsible for each
1512.94,of the three steps to arrive
at,something truly creative.
1516.33,The first neural circuit
involved,in creativity
1518.37,is the so-called
executive,network.
1520.77,This is a goofy name because
the,neural circuits that I'm
1523.71,about to describe do a bunch
of,"other things as well,"
1526.11,but they certainly control what
are,called executive functions.
1529.62,Executive functions
are,functions
1531.9,"that you and I both have,"
which,is our ability
1535.35,to govern our thinking
and,our behavior
1537.48,in very deliberate ways.
1538.95,And that is largely
accomplished,through the use
1542.01,of the neural circuitry
that,sits right
1544.29,"behind the forebrain, the"
so-called,prefrontal cortex.
1546.85,"Now, the prefrontal"
cortex,involves
1549.18,many different subregions.
1550.565,It has a bunch of
different,parts
1551.94,just like any country has
different,"states, et cetera"
1554.148,and provinces.
1555.72,Executive function involves
the,prefrontal cortex
1558.0,and some other
neural,structures.
1560.14,But for the sake
of,"this discussion,"
1562.65,executive function and
the,prefrontal cortex
1565.59,are mainly responsible
for,suppressing action.
1568.71,"That is, for eliminating choices"
among,the infinite number
1573.3,of choices that exist.
1574.96,"For instance, of what colors"
to,combine on a painting
1577.26,or what lines to draw
or,what notes to play
1579.66,or what movements
to,make in a sports
1581.34,"endeavor, what numbers to"
include,in a mathematics
1583.68,"endeavor, or what words"
and,letters and syllables
1587.04,and sentences to include in
writing,a creative passage.
1591.95,The second network is the
so-called,default mode network.
1595.162,There's a lot of discussion
nowadays,about the default mode
1597.62,network as it relates to
consciousness,"and meditation,"
1600.38,et cetera.
1600.92,The default mode network
does,many different things.
1603.54,But in the context of our
discussion,"about creativity,"
1605.93,the default mode
network,is really
1608.3,the network that
starts,being engaged
1610.16,when you close your eyes
and,start paying attention
1613.1,to what's going on in terms
of,your thinking as opposed
1616.13,to the sensory outside world.
1618.38,And the default mode network is
especially,important for what's
1622.1,called spontaneous imagination.
1624.03,"Now, spontaneous"
imagination,is something
1625.94,that you can try at any moment
if,you were to close your eyes
1628.55,and to try and not pay attention
to,the sounds around you.
1631.58,"But even if you do, to just"
pay,attention to whatever
1636.16,thoughts or feelings emerge
when,your eyes are closed.
1639.72,By closing your eyes
and,shutting yourself
1641.47,off to the outside
sensory,"world,"
1644.18,you start to engage much
more,of your brain machinery
1647.29,dedicated towards
what's,going on
1649.12,"inside you, so-called"
interoception,but also
1651.46,what you're thinking
about,your thinking
1653.38,whether or not your thoughts
are,"complete or incomplete,"
1656.0,whether or not they are
fragmentary,in a way that goes
1658.69,from one thought to another
distantly,in the past
1661.27,"or present to future, et cetera."
1662.89,Depending on time of
"day,",how well-rested
1664.885,"you are, how stressed you"
"are,","how happy you are,"
1667.57,the default mode
network,will take you
1669.368,through a journey of
different,"types of thoughts,"
1671.41,different types of
"feelings,",et cetera.
1673.035,The specific types of
thoughts,and feelings
1675.07,are not as interesting
as,the fact
1676.54,that when you close your
eyes,you're essentially
1678.4,engaging this default mode
"network,",which is essentially
1680.8,the network associated with
imagination,and imagination
1684.04,based on elements that exist
only,"within your head, that"
1687.88,is within your brain and
therefore,must rely on memory
1693.01,of previous experiences.
1694.685,As soon as you close your
"eyes,",you are shutting yourself
1697.06,off from the sensory world.
1698.54,So by definition
you,can no longer
1700.39,be bringing in novel
experiences,in that moment.
1703.12,You're relying on your library
of,existing experiences
1706.3,and your memory of those in
order,to imagine new things.
1709.45,And you're doing this in a
very,free associative way.
1711.963,You're not trying to
imagine,new things.
1713.63,It's just whatever
geysers,to the surface.
1715.7,So we've got the
executive,"network,"
1717.16,which is involved in suppressing
particular,thoughts or actions.
1721.12,We have the default
mode,"network, which"
1723.37,is involved in imagination.
1724.78,And the default mode network
I,should mention also
1727.06,involves a subregion of
the,prefrontal cortex.
1728.99,It's called the medial
prefrontal,cortex
1730.657,but other brain regions as well.
1732.71,And then the final
element,within
1734.35,the circuits
underlying,creativity
1735.963,is the so-called
salience,network.
1737.38,The salience network is a
network,of brain regions
1741.19,that involves areas such as
the,"Insula, which actually"
1743.98,has a complete map
of,your body surface
1745.75,as well as some
information,mapped there
1747.96,about what's going on
in,the outside world
1749.71,and how those
combined,with what's
1750.94,going on in your
internal,"landscape, that"
1752.648,is within your body.
1753.7,Also a brain region called
the,ACC or intengu--
1756.49,"excuse me, anterior cingulate"
cortex,and the amygdala.
1760.185,So a lot of
information,is mapped
1761.56,within the salience
network,about how we feel
1764.207,and how we feel in relation
to,things that are happening
1766.54,around us and within us.
1768.11,And the salience network
has,"one main job,"
1770.752,which is to pay
attention,to what's
1772.21,most interesting either
in,the world or inside us
1777.07,in terms of feelings
or,experiences.
1779.75,So we've got three networks--
executive,"network, which"
1782.53,is there to suppress
choices,in terms of actions
1786.13,we could take but
decide,"not to, or things"
1788.44,we could think about but
choose,"not to or try not to,"
1791.32,"the default mode network,"
which,is basically the catalog
1794.83,or library of
previous,experiences
1797.59,that we have available to us
that,would act as the paints
1801.76,on a palette or the
possible,ingredients
1805.24,that could go into a recipe.
1806.59,"All of that has to, again,"
arise,from previous experience.
1809.47,We can't close our
eyes,and suddenly
1811.51,be able to access all the
melodies,that we've never
1814.51,heard before or all our ideas
and,concepts and knowledge
1818.41,about music if we don't
have,musical understanding
1820.72,or visual understanding.
1821.92,So we're really
drawing,up the library.
1824.23,And that library tends to
be,rather disorganized.
1826.66,It swirls around.
1827.95,It's not very structured
unless,we're actively trying
1830.86,to think about something.
1832.15,And then we have the
salience,"network,"
1834.31,which is the networks within
the,brain that decide or make
1837.4,choices about what's most
interesting,to pay attention to
1839.95,in a given moment.
1841.52,So those three networks work
together,to create things.
1845.29,And when I say create
"things,",we again
1847.48,have to really
definition,of creativity.
1850.78,Creativity is a rearrangement
of,existing elements into novel
1855.46,combinations that reveal
something,fundamental about how
1858.37,we or the world works.
1860.29,"And, this is very important."
1862.73,It tends to be things
that,are useful.
1865.99,"Now, they can merely be"
useful,because they're
1867.91,entertaining or
"thrilling,",they can also
1870.04,have a particular utility
or,use in the world
1872.11,like a piece of technology
that,is actually
1874.39,useful like an app
or,a smartphone
1877.03,or a computer actually
has,utility or a vehicle.
1880.06,There are creative acts that
led,to the formation of vehicles
1883.84,"and computers, et cetera."
1885.28,But the point is that
just,merely coming up
1888.46,with novel combinations of
things,like wings on a fish
1890.95,"tank, that's not"
creative,or it's not
1893.17,creative in any meaningful way
because,it's simply not useful.
1897.71,It doesn't reveal anything
fundamental,new or purposeful.
1901.39,It doesn't allow
us,to think about
1903.19,or interact with the world
or,ourselves in novel ways.
1905.77,"Whereas things, people,"
"actions,",and ideas
1910.69,that are truly creative
really,change the way
1913.408,that we are able to
access,the world.
1914.95,They act as portals to the
world,and to ourselves.
1918.58,I'd like to take a quick
break,and acknowledge
1920.83,one of our sponsors
Athletic,Greens.
1922.99,Athletic Greenes now called AG1
is,a vitamin mineral probiotic
1927.31,drink that covers all of your
foundational,nutritional needs.
1930.64,I've been taking Athletic
Greene,since 2012.
1933.192,So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
1935.7,The reason I started taking
Athletic,Greens and the reason
1938.117,"I still take Athletic Greens,"
once,or usually twice a day
1941.19,is that it gets to me
the,probiotics that I
1943.53,"need for gut health, our"
gut,is very important.
1946.08,It's populated by
gut,microbiota that
1948.56,"communicate with the brain, the"
immune,"system, and basically"
1951.06,all the biological
systems,of our body
1952.8,to strongly impact our
immediate,and long-term health.
1956.34,And those probiotics
and,Athletic Greens
1958.26,are optimal and vital
for,microbiome health.
1962.043,"In addition, Athletic"
Greens,contains a number
1963.96,"of adaptogens,"
"vitamins,",and minerals
1965.58,that make sure that all of my
foundational,nutritional needs
1968.22,are met.
1968.85,And it tastes great.
1970.818,If you'd like to
try,"Athletic Greens,"
1972.36,you can go to
"athleticgreens.com/huberman,",
1975.57,and they'll give you five
free,travel packs that make it
1978.12,really easy to mix up
Athletic,Greens while
1980.107,"you're on the road, in the"
"car,","on the plane, et cetera."
1982.44,And they'll give you a year
supply,of vitamin D-3 K-2.
1986.04,"Again, that's"
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
1988.65,to get the five free travel
packs,and the year supply
1991.23,of vitamin D-3 K-2.
1992.91,So now you have some idea about
the,brain areas and networks
1995.61,involved in creativity.
1997.44,But I want to be very
clear,that any time we
1999.69,talk about mechanisms
and,"brain areas, what's"
2001.88,far more important than the
names,of those brain areas
2004.43,is an understanding
of,what they do.
2005.947,So if you couldn't remember
the,anterior cingulate
2008.03,cortex or the fact that
the,prefrontal cortex is
2010.16,"involved in executive function,"
et,"cetera, that's fine."
2013.58,It's less important that
you,know the names of things
2015.8,than you understand the action
steps,that those things take.
2018.86,That is the verb actions
that,those particular brain
2021.77,areas engage in order to arrive
at,a particular endpoint.
2024.41,And the endpoint we're talking
about,today is creativity.
2028.47,I want to discuss creativity
in,terms of what actually
2031.67,goes into being creative.
2033.11,And it turns out there
are,just two elements.
2035.012,And those two
elements,are now well
2036.47,understood from the
perspective,of psychology
2038.54,"and fortunately, the"
neuroscience,well
2041.39,supports what the psychology
says,and vise versa.
2044.51,And those two elements
that,go into coming up
2047.48,with a creative idea and then
implementing,or developing
2050.929,that creative idea
into,something real
2052.98,that you and the rest of
the,world can experience
2055.55,or divergent thinking
and,convergent thinking.
2059.03,And divergent thinking
and,convergent thinking
2061.909,are very straightforward
to,understand.
2064.61,Divergent thinking is taking
some,known object or event
2071.15,in the world or
sport,or concept.
2074.449,It could be running.
2075.409,It could be a musical note.
2076.94,It could be jumping.
2078.17,It could be a particular
color,on a piece of paper.
2082.46,And asking yourself how
many,different things
2087.32,could that thing actually be.
2089.297,"And you might say, well,"
running,is running.
2091.13,But let's use divergent
thinking,as a way
2093.65,to illustrate what
divergent,thinking is.
2095.659,If I show you a picture
of,"somebody running,"
2097.508,"I say, what do you."
2098.3,See and you say I
see,somebody running.
2100.19,And then I might give you
a,divergent thinking task
2103.16,and these tasks
are,the same ones
2104.84,used in various experiments.
2106.103,"And I'd say, how many"
different,things can you
2108.02,think about based on
this,picture that you
2111.53,see of somebody running.
2112.91,"Now, if you are able to"
engage,"divergent thinking,"
2115.86,you could say
running,to the store.
2118.73,Running away from a lion.
2120.65,Running towards somebody I love.
2122.69,Or maybe you have a more
elaborate,imagination
2125.81,"and you could say,"
running,in front of a bus
2129.41,to grab a kid so the kid
doesn't,get hit by the bus.
2132.08,Or running toward a
concert,because I'm
2134.18,so excited about the
particular,concert
2136.07,and then it starts to
spool,into a story.
2137.85,"In other words,"
divergent,thinking
2139.88,involves taking one simple what
we,would call a neuroscience
2143.6,"or psychology stimulus, one"
"image,","or sound, et cetera"
2147.2,and trying to
radiate,out from that
2149.24,as many different divergent
"situations,","properties,"
2156.2,"characteristics, events, things"
from,that one specific element.
2161.09,So any divergent thinking task
would,involve exactly that.
2163.82,I'd show you pictures or play
you,sounds or words or notes
2168.02,or describe to you
events,in history
2171.26,and try and see how many
things,can radiate out
2174.17,"from that in to diverse,"
"diverse,",even distant types
2178.67,of concepts and pictures.
2180.16,OK.
2180.66,So that's divergent thinking.
2182.1,Divergent thinking
is,really the process
2183.95,that underlies idea generation.
2186.17,And the basis of
divergent,thinking
2189.38,is that more than
one,idea is correct.
2192.17,"In fact, the more ideas that"
you,"have about one thing,"
2195.56,the better your
divergent,thinking.
2197.57,So if I were to give you
three,minutes to list off
2200.69,all the things you can think
about,related to this pen
2203.787,that I'm holding up.
2204.62,For those of you listening
I'm,just holding up
2205.76,a pen in front of me.
2207.23,You just write them
out,or say them out.
2208.97,Over the next 3 minutes
that,would be an example
2211.623,of divergent thinking.
2212.54,"However, if you just said"
black,"pen, red pen, white pen,"
2215.595,"green pen, et cetera, that's"
not,very divergent thinking.
2217.97,It's only divergent in the
context,of color space.
2221.01,And when I say space
that's,just a nerd
2223.13,speak for one particular
domain,of thinking.
2225.68,Whereas if you said
red,"pen, white pen,"
2230.0,essay pen in a door
to,hold the door
2233.54,open so that someone can
return,to a building.
2235.94,And you started spooling
off,a story related to that
2238.25,"and why that was important,"
"well,",there you go.
2240.32,Divergent thinking is
essentially,taking one element
2243.17,and coming up with
"many,",many answers.
2244.942,And in the context of
divergent,"thinking,"
2246.65,"any answer goes, but"
as,"we'll soon learn,"
2249.32,not every answer is
interesting,and relevant
2252.14,that is not every answer help
solve,something or reveal
2255.53,something fundamental
and,"therefore,"
2257.03,not every divergent
answer,is truly creative.
2260.697,The other aspect of
divergent,thinking
2262.28,that's really
important,to understand
2263.96,is that the selection criteria
are,extremely vague and vast.
2269.12,"That is, there"
are,no constraints
2270.56,on what you come up with.
2271.86,So if I hold up this
pen,"and you say,"
2273.77,"orangutan, that's a perfectly"
valid,divergent idea
2278.63,from this pen because
you,thought of it
2280.58,and it's distantly related.
2281.75,"However, we have to"
remember,our earlier rule.
2285.47,If black pen and orangutan are
not,"linked up in our brain,"
2291.23,in the observer's brain
in,"any meaningful way,"
2293.66,it's only interesting
to,you because you
2296.185,are the only one
that,understands
2297.56,the rule that underlies the link
between,this pen and orangutan.
2302.33,Whereas if you come up with
something,different that
2305.48,somehow tells me and
everybody,else something
2307.76,interesting about
pens,"or orangutans,"
2309.5,now that's a truly
creative,idea.
2311.63,I don't have such
an,example in mind
2313.418,but later I'll give
you,some examples
2314.96,of how you can actually
March,down the path
2316.752,of divergent thinking and
use,that executive network
2319.73,to suppress certain
options,to cross off
2321.62,"certain answers because, again,"
an,answer is valid but not all
2325.97,valid answers are
interesting,or useful.
2328.67,And you can cross
those,off and arrive
2330.53,at the most interesting
and,truly creative answer.
2334.16,A couple of more things
about,divergent thinking.
2336.45,Divergent thinking largely
taps,into the networks
2338.9,of the brain that are involved
in,mental flexibility.
2342.51,So this is a different aspect
of,"our prefrontal cortex, which"
2345.95,is not based on executive
function,and our ability
2348.83,to reduce options but rather
areas,of the prefrontal cortex
2354.33,that are available to
generate,multiple options
2357.3,and actually suppress context
to,forget that pens are just
2360.973,"for writing, for"
"instance,",and that pens
2362.64,can do other things
like,hold a door open.
2364.5,It's really an
unusual,use of a pen.
2367.005,"Again, none of these"
examples,that I'm giving
2368.88,are particularly interesting.
2370.118,They're just designed to get
you,to understand the underlying
2372.66,concept of divergent thinking.
2374.55,And then the last
thing,I'd like you
2376.05,to know about divergent thinking
is,that divergent thinking
2379.35,involves a exploration.
2381.66,It's a wandering through
of,ideas that you already
2385.14,"had in your library, in"
your,memory banks about pens
2389.58,and what pens
could,be related to
2392.13,and what pens ought
not,to be related to.
2394.95,"So, again, what's really"
important,about creativity
2397.68,is that there has to be the
basic,building blocks already
2401.13,existing within us.
2402.31,This is why it's so
important,to understand
2404.55,that if you are somebody who
really,"seeks to be creative,"
2407.67,you really do need to
be,somebody who forages
2410.28,for information and structured
information,in particular
2414.09,if you are to be creative.
2415.74,The architect
simply,can't come up
2417.69,with incredible drawings
or,plans for buildings
2421.26,without understanding how
buildings,are put together
2423.48,in the various rules
that,govern buildings.
2425.808,"In other words, you"
can't,break rules
2427.35,that you don't understand.
2428.64,"I think in movies,"
"especially,",we
2431.82,have this idea in mind
of,this limitless concept
2435.42,or that we have these hidden
geniuses,that somehow have
2439.32,access to all the math
knowledge,without ever having
2442.38,done any formal math.
2443.28,Actually I was flying
back,from Texas recently
2445.792,and Good Will Hunting
was,on somebody's screen.
2447.75,I don't tend to watch
movies,on the plane
2449.458,"very often, sometimes"
but,not often.
2451.27,And I was remembering
in,"that movie,"
2452.85,you've got this math genius who
is,"a janitor at MIT, et cetera"
2458.13,and apparently just has
access,to all this knowledge.
2460.86,It's a wonderful concept.
2462.93,"A very, very I would say"
even,exceedingly rare thing
2466.83,to occur in the world.
2467.797,Sure there are people
who,seem to have
2469.38,a natural talent for mathematics
or,for something else.
2472.24,But this idea that
there,are incredible
2475.59,geniuses among us that
just,spontaneously
2478.2,"have so much knowledge, that's"
by,far the exception rather
2482.4,"than the rule, of course, and"
may,not even actually exist.
2484.902,I'm sure someone will put
it,in the comments examples
2487.11,where this actually exists.
2488.04,More often than
"not,",what you find
2489.48,is that people who have extreme
virtuosity,in a given area
2493.26,"put many, many years"
into,developing
2496.32,"the basic substrates,"
the,basic building blocks
2498.93,of whatever it is
their,craft happens
2500.49,to be where they
demonstrate,virtuosity.
2502.26,So this is very
important,to understand.
2503.927,"Nonetheless, divergent thinking"
is,the critical element
2508.86,for initiating the
creative,process.
2511.5,"Again, thinking about"
creativity,as a verb.
2513.54,And divergent thinking involves
taking,"some starting point,"
2517.86,"in this case a pen,"
and,then radiating out
2520.2,from that in a fairly
unconstrained,what biologists
2523.08,call a random walk just
wandering,through your thought
2526.44,space and memory
space,about what
2528.12,could be related to this pen.
2529.44,"Now, on the flip"
side,of creativity
2531.0,is the implementation of
specific,combinations of things
2535.38,and testing those to see whether
or,"not they are interesting,"
2538.5,"relevant, or delight"
to,us or other people
2541.38,or scare us or other people
or,thrill us or other people.
2544.59,"In other words, a testing"
of,whether or not there's
2547.77,some fundamental rule to emerge.
2550.59,"Again, I'm going to repeat"
this,"many, many times"
2552.87,throughout this
episode,and I'm not
2554.01,going to apologize for
that,because I think
2555.54,it's so important to understand
that,creativity is not just
2558.0,novel combinations.
2558.93,They are novel
combinations,of things that
2561.03,reveal something fundamental.
2562.65,And that often pop out
to,us if not every time
2566.43,certainly most of the time
that,we see that thing.
2568.8,It almost never
seems,to be the case
2570.87,that something truly creative
dulls,in its expression.
2574.14,And that's because what
it's,repeating to us
2576.45,over and over again is this
fundamental,rule that normally
2579.06,we can't see or
hear,or experience
2581.04,in the absence of
this,creative act.
2583.68,So the second part of creativity
where,things are tested
2587.73,and where truly creative
elements,are discovered
2590.85,is in convergent thinking.
2592.53,And convergent thinking
"is,",as the name
2594.21,"suggests, just the opposite"
of,divergent thinking.
2596.37,Convergent thinking
would,"be, for example,"
2599.323,if I give you an image or I
tell,"you the following things,"
2601.74,"I say wing, water, an engine."
2607.69,The concept that I
happen,to have in mind
2609.61,is that of a plane
that,can land on water.
2613.66,Most planes don't
land,on water or not
2616.12,intended to land on water.
2617.83,One would hope that
their,plane doesn't
2619.48,land on water unless
it's,a plane designed
2621.23,to land on water.
2622.18,"But in this case, a plane"
that,can land on water
2625.69,is one of the very few answers
that,"can combine wing, water,"
2632.11,and engine.
2633.73,I'm sure there
are,"other answers,"
2635.14,there are other
convergent,thinking modes
2637.39,that can take you to an
answer,that would be valid.
2639.86,But there are not many.
2641.08,And here what's
really,most important
2642.67,is that I'm not asking
you,to spool out
2644.8,or to radiate out from
these,three things.
2647.68,"Rather, I'm asking you to"
combine,them in some way that
2650.14,makes sense in the real world.
2652.33,And indeed there are planes
that,can land on water.
2655.0,And wing water and
engine,combined
2658.493,within those things
they,are fundamental
2660.16,"features, they are in"
"fact,",necessary but not
2663.13,sufficient for having a
plane,that can land on water.
2666.05,OK.
2666.55,So that's just one example
of,convergent thinking.
2668.633,And a convergent
thinking,task would
2670.36,involve you being given
a,list of two or three
2673.19,or maybe even five
different,things.
2674.69,And then for each of
those,two or three or five
2676.09,"different things,"
as,quickly as you
2677.62,can to come up with
a,single answer
2679.51,that binds all of those
in,a real world concept
2682.36,that obey the laws of nature
or,physics in some way.
2685.84,"For instance, you can just come"
up,"with some answer that said,"
2690.28,a bird that swallowed
an,engine and that
2693.79,happens to be a sea bird.
2694.96,"You could come up with that,"
but,that actually is not
2697.24,something that happens or
is,that very typical at all.
2700.58,And so it seems like a mishmash
of,things that are really
2703.75,just designed for you
to,try and accomplish
2705.61,an answer rather
than,"something real,"
2707.36,such as a plane
that,lands on water.
2709.07,OK.
2709.75,The point here is that
divergent,thinking
2712.69,is one aspect of our
"cognition,",of our thinking.
2716.14,And convergent thinking
is,a very distinct aspect
2719.68,of our cognition.
2720.91,"In fact, one of the"
critical,requirements
2723.61,for convergent thinking is
also,to access our memory banks
2726.805,and our understanding
about,the outside world
2728.68,just as it were with
divergent,"thinking,"
2730.99,but it requires more focus
and,more persistence.
2735.16,"In fact, if we were to"
come,up with a key rule
2737.56,for divergent
"thinking,",it would be
2739.15,you almost want to have just
enough,focus to remember what
2742.12,the initial object or
thing,that was mentioned
2745.27,was to keep that in mind
so,that your answers don't
2748.24,become completely random.
2749.62,But the more distant and
everywhere,in between that
2753.31,you can generate
answers,"that is,"
2755.35,the things that are
very,"close to pens,"
2757.69,"black pen, red pen"
versus,"pen and doorstop,"
2761.47,pen acting as a doorstop.
2763.06,Those are-- one is
very,"close, red pen is"
2766.81,"very close to black pen,"
doorstop,is pretty far
2769.75,from black pen.
2771.19,So that's the idea.
2772.51,Is that you want to explore and
undergo,a range of exploration
2775.773,of different ideas whereas
with,"convergent thinking,"
2777.94,you're really trying to
bind,these things together.
2780.26,And so the key element
for,convergent thinking
2783.64,is the aspect of
persistence,and focus.
2787.06,And that's why convergent
thinking,in many ways
2790.27,feels harder than
divergent,thinking.
2792.55,It feels like there's an answer.
2793.99,And I want to get the answer
right,and I can't solve it.
2796.323,It's a puzzle and
it's,a puzzle that
2797.89,relies on very
distinct,brain circuits
2799.99,from divergent thinking.
2801.16,Which brain circuits?
2802.39,"Well, that's what we're"
going,to describe next.
2804.43,"And again, this"
is,not just going
2805.805,to be a list of different brain
circuits,with different names
2808.382,"doing different things,"
that,wouldn't be useful
2810.34,to you or to me.
2811.57,"Rather, what you're about to"
learn,is truly incredible.
2815.92,What it is we're going to talk
about,one single molecule--
2819.46,"dopamine, which is a"
molecule,most typically
2822.43,associated with motivation
and,desire and drive
2825.1,and feelings of
pleasure,in some cases.
2826.96,But that actually resides
within,four different networks
2830.828,in the brain.
2831.37,Today we're going to talk
about,two of those networks.
2833.92,And dopamine acting
in,one network
2837.8,directly underlies
divergent,thinking.
2840.89,Whereas dopamine in
another,brain network
2843.38,underlies convergent thinking.
2845.42,And if at this point
in,this episode
2847.225,"you're saying OK,"
when,am I going
2848.6,to get the tools to
understand,creativity
2850.4,"and how to be creative,"
what,I can assure
2852.26,you is that if you understand
divergent,thinking which
2854.63,"hopefully now you do, and you"
can,understand what convergent
2857.63,"thinking is, and"
you,can understand
2860.39,that dopamine is responsible
for,both divergent thinking
2864.17,and convergent thinking but
through,separate pathways.
2867.29,"Well, then if you can understand"
how,those two separate pathways
2870.17,work and how to engage
them,"differentially,"
2873.14,therein lie the tools that you
can,use both to explore ideas.
2878.07,"In other words, find what it"
is,that could be creative.
2881.6,And then systematically
test,each of those ideas
2884.81,for what is truly creative.
2886.4,That is what meets the
criteria,for something
2888.59,that is novel and truly
useful,and informs us
2891.62,about something that we've never
"seen,","heard, or felt before."
2895.17,Let's just take a moment to talk
about,the incredible molecule
2897.77,that is dopamine.
2899.51,Many people are familiar with
dopamine,from the concept
2902.0,of quote unquote
dopamine,"hits, which"
2904.88,is popular language describing
the,feeling of pleasure
2908.75,that we get from pretty
much,anything that we like
2912.32,or that we continue to
engage,in repeatedly.
2914.45,So some people will talk
about,the dopamine hit
2916.408,that they get from
somebody,attractive
2918.5,that they like texting them back
or,the dopamine hit that they
2921.565,get from social media or
the,dopamine hit that they
2923.69,get from sugar or the dopamine
that,they get from this
2926.0,or from that.
2927.08,"To be honest, the"
concept,of dopamine hits
2929.66,is not one that I favor because
in,"general, whenever people"
2933.032,talk about dopamine
"hits,",typically
2934.49,they are talking
about,activities
2935.865,such as social media
for,which dopamine
2938.75,may be involved at some level.
2940.82,But often it's the case
that,the behavior associated
2944.45,with that thing in
this,"case, social media"
2946.22,is more of the compulsive
nature,rather than
2949.04,an active seeking of something
with,positive anticipation.
2952.49,And that's really what
dopamine,is about at least
2954.83,in the context of one of its
major,functions in the brain.
2957.38,Dopamine is really about
motivation,and desire
2960.53,and movement.
2962.3,And it makes sense why
"motivation,","desire,"
2964.16,and movement would be
linked,"up through a common,"
2967.19,in this case neuromodulator
or,chemical like dopamine.
2970.34,Because throughout
evolution,if we
2972.98,were excited for or motivated
to,"pursue something,"
2976.82,we had to move in order
to,"get it, to obtain it."
2979.97,"And in general, we"
can,frame dopamine
2981.77,under the umbrella
of,dopamine tends
2983.425,to be involved in
neural,circuits
2984.8,in the brain that are involved
in,processes that are taking us
2989.0,beyond the confines of our skin.
2990.92,"That is, they motivate us"
to,go do something in terms
2993.62,of action in the world.
2995.03,"Now, that statement might"
seem,distantly placed
2998.57,from a discussion
about,"creativity,"
3000.377,but as we'll learn
a,"little bit later,"
3001.96,one of the most useful tools
for,engaging creativity
3006.07,and becoming more creative is
to,think about action elements
3010.39,within a narrative.
3011.44,"That is, things that we"
and,others can do in order
3014.26,to discover new rules
through,actual movement.
3017.74,That's a little bit cryptic.
3019.48,Forgive me.
3020.11,But I promise I'll
return,to it later
3021.652,and I will make
it,crystal clear.
3024.46,There are four major circuits
in,the brain that use dopamine.
3027.88,"Although I should mention,"
there,are additional circuits
3030.45,as well.
3030.95,"In fact, your eye"
even,contains neurons
3032.883,that release
dopamine,that control
3034.3,the sensitivity of your eye
at,different times of day
3036.73,"to light, et cetera."
3038.23,The four major
circuits,in the brain
3039.73,that utilize
dopamine,"however, are"
3041.29,used for four major purposes.
3043.395,And I'll describe
what,those are.
3044.77,First of all is a
neural,circuit that
3047.17,uses dopamine among other
things,but certainly relies
3050.14,on dopamine in a critical way
to,"engage movement, including"
3054.19,eye movements.
3054.903,And we will return
to,eye movement
3056.32,to why they're so important
for,understanding creativity
3059.14,and maybe even for generating
creativity,a little bit later.
3062.39,The name of the
"circuit,","again, is less"
3064.24,important than what it does.
3065.81,But the name of this circuit
for,those that want to know
3068.56,is the so-called
nigrostriatal,pathway.
3071.53,The substantia nigra
is,a brain area
3073.6,that is very dark that
projects,to an area
3076.42,called the dorsal striatum.
3077.853,It contains a bunch
of,subregions.
3079.27,"So, again, for those of you that"
really,geek out on this stuff
3081.853,"great, you can learn these names"
and,retain them in your memory.
3084.633,If you don't care about
"names,","don't worry about it,"
3086.8,just discard the names.
3087.91,But areas of the brain like
the,caudate and putamen
3090.22,and the dorsal
striatum,receive input
3091.99,from the substantia nigra.
3093.76,"In neuroanatomy, when"
we,"name something,"
3096.52,we say the origin of that thing
and,where it connects through.
3100.6,So nigrostriatal
tells,you that there
3103.147,is a connection between
the,substantia nigra
3104.98,because it came
"first,","nigrostriatal,"
3106.63,and then striatal
is,where it ends up.
3108.43,So nigrostriatal pathway is
involved,in generating bodily
3111.4,movements.
3112.24,It's involved in eye movements.
3114.58,And it is actually
a,brain area that's
3116.95,engaged when you
think,about movement.
3119.943,You can just have a story
in,your mind about walking
3122.11,or a story in your mind
about,running or story
3124.225,in your mind about driving.
3125.44,This area is engaged.
3126.79,Very interesting brain area.
3128.89,So that's the first circuit.
3130.172,Very important to understand.
3131.38,And I'll tell you
right,"now, that"
3133.09,is the brain circuit
that,is engaged when
3136.0,you undergo divergent thinking.
3139.39,"Now, that itself"
should,be interesting.
3141.37,Even if you don't remember
any,of the names of the things
3143.29,"I just told you, that"
you,have a brain circuit
3145.24,that even if you just
think,about walking it
3148.0,becomes more active.
3148.93,And the dopamine is involved
in,that brain activity.
3151.88,"And if you recall,"
divergent,thinking
3153.82,involves taking a concept
as,boring as a pen
3158.62,and thinking about
other,concepts that
3161.71,could link up with that pen in
some,"way, logical or illogical."
3165.67,The bridge could be completely
abstract,and really fantastical
3169.99,with a bunch of different
ideas,in between.
3172.09,A pen acting as a doorstop
because,of some situation
3174.498,where you need to run
down,stairs in a fire
3176.29,and get back upstairs
quickly,to rescue
3177.915,"somebody, very divergent."
3179.35,Or as divergent as
black,pen to red pen.
3183.15,But what's amazing is
that,that same circuit
3185.7,is the one that's involved
in,generating and thinking
3189.69,about physical movement.
3190.8,That turns out to be vitally
important,for tapping
3193.83,into the creativity process.
3195.1,So really frame that up in your
mind,or commit it to memory.
3197.74,"Now, the second dopamine circuit"
associated,with creativity
3200.46,is the one associated with
convergent,"thinking, which,"
3203.19,"again, is the"
thinking,where there's
3204.69,a specific correct answer.
3206.81,It requires focus and
it,requires persistence.
3209.46,And the name of that
"circuit,","again, the name"
3211.47,isn't as important
as,what it does.
3212.95,But the name of that circuit
is,the mesocortical pathway.
3217.59,The mesocortical pathway
is,involved in motivation
3221.07,and it has an emotional
component,too.
3224.09,"Now, it will become"
clear,in a few minutes
3225.84,why that emotional
component,is vital.
3227.97,But this is a circuit
that,originates
3229.53,in a brain structure called the
lateral,ventral tegmental area.
3233.16,"Again, a bunch of words you"
can,"remember it if you want,"
3235.53,lateral ventral
tegmental,area or you
3238.14,can not worry about the name.
3239.52,And it connects to
the,"prefrontal cortex,"
3241.38,that area just
behind,the forehead.
3243.31,And this mesocortical
area,is involved
3245.31,in motivation and emotion
and,is critical for focus
3248.19,and persistence.
3249.39,It is distinct from
a,"very nearby area,"
3251.91,just sitting right next door
the,"so-called mesolimbic area,"
3256.08,which is involved in desire
and,feelings of reward.
3260.08,And this is the area that
is,associated more typically
3262.44,with addictive behaviors
or,compulsive behaviors.
3266.305,We're going to leave
out,the discussion
3267.93,about the mesolimbic
pathway,for now
3269.97,because it's not critical
to,divergent or convergent
3273.27,thinking and it's not critical
to,the process of creativity
3277.02,at least as far as we know.
3278.682,But I mention it because it
is,the third and the four
3280.89,dopaminergic circuits.
3281.82,And then the fourth
circuit,certainly
3283.89,one I've never talked about
before,"on this podcast, which"
3287.31,doesn't mean anything
except,that we
3288.81,"haven't gotten to it yet,"
is,that tuberoinfundibular
3292.77,pathway.
3293.43,And that is the
pathway,associated
3294.99,with dopamine and
your,pituitary gland
3296.91,and the release of
"hormones,",in particular
3299.76,that travel to the ovary.
3301.068,If you have ovaries
or,to your testes
3302.61,if you have testes and
trigger,the release of things
3304.777,like estrogen and
"testosterone,",et cetera.
3307.29,Dopamine is intimately
involved,in that circuitry.
3311.04,"Again, not the topic"
of,today's discussion.
3313.5,"For today's discussion,"
we,want to remember
3315.42,that there's a
dopamine,circuit called
3317.01,"the nigrostriatal circuit,"
which,is involved in movement
3319.74,and divergent thinking.
3322.38,And that alone should set
a,"flag up for you like wow,"
3325.68,just thinking about
new,ideas has something
3327.93,to do with physical movement.
3330.24,And the dopamine circuit that is
the,"mesocortical pathway, which"
3336.34,is the one that's associated
with,"motivation and emotion,"
3339.49,and that's the one required
for,persistence and focus
3341.95,for convergent thinking.
3343.46,Why am I telling you all
of,this about dopamine?
3346.27,"Well, it turns out that dopamine"
creates,a certain number
3350.89,of responses in the brain and
body,when it is active in one
3355.778,or the other of these circuits.
3357.07,And just for sake
of,"simplicity, so"
3358.93,I don't have to keep saying
nigrostriatal,and mesocortical.
3363.55,"Here going forward,"
I'm,going to talk
3365.74,about the dopamine
circuit,that's
3367.57,associated with
divergent,thinking
3369.46,or the dopamine
circuit,associated
3371.11,with convergent thinking.
3372.235,"And, again, divergent"
thinking,and convergent
3374.11,think are the two processes
that,have to occur.
3377.56,Usually first divergent then
convergent,thinking then
3380.175,back and forth
and,back and forth
3381.55,in order to arrive at
something,creative.
3383.74,Divergent thinking
is,about exploration.
3385.475,Convergent thinking is about
testing,things and coming up
3387.85,with things that are the
right,answer that feel right.
3390.58,And we will better define what
right,means a little bit later.
3393.55,But you already know
right,in this context
3397.57,is when you have some
combination,of elements
3400.96,or some idea or
some,written passage
3402.76,or some music or
some,physical action
3405.19,that you just know this is
really,novel and really cool.
3410.71,Or people see it or
hear,it or taste it
3414.55,"and say, this is really"
novel,and really cool
3416.83,and they don't
necessarily,know why.
3418.66,It's just different in
a,way that feels true.
3421.69,I'd like to take a brief
break,and thank our sponsor
3424.9,InsideTracker.
3426.37,InsideTracker is a
personalized,nutrition platform
3429.01,that analyzes data
from,your blood and DNA
3431.44,to help you better
understand,your body
3433.18,and help you reach
your,health goals.
3434.95,I've long been a
believer,in getting
3436.45,regular blood work done.
3437.56,For the simple reason
that,many of the factors
3440.042,that impact your immediate
and,long term health
3442.0,can only be analyzed from
a,quality blood test.
3444.535,The problem with a lot
of,blood and DNA tests
3446.41,"out there however,"
is,that you get data
3448.36,"back about metabolic factors,"
"lipids,","and hormones,"
3451.33,and so forth.
3451.88,But you don't know what
to,do with those data.
3453.797,InsideTracker
solves,that problem.
3455.38,And makes it very easy for you
to,"understand what nutritional,"
3459.67,"behavioral, maybe even"
supplementation,based
3462.52,interventions you might
want,to take on in order
3465.13,to adjust the numbers of
those,"metabolic factors,"
3467.29,"hormones, lipids,"
and,other things that
3469.21,impact your immediate and
long-term,health to bring
3471.58,those numbers into the
ranges,that are appropriate
3474.04,and indeed optimal for you.
3475.78,If you'd like to
try,"InsideTracker,"
3477.34,you can visit
insidetracker.com/huberman,
3479.86,and get 20% off any of
InsideTracker's,plans.
3482.41,That's

3485.02,to get 20% off.
3486.167,"Now, I realize that for some of"
you,"listening to this episode,"
3488.75,we are probably at the point
along,the pathway of concept
3492.16,and definition
and,mechanism that
3494.95,leaves you in a place
of,real wanting a tool.
3498.02,And so I promise that I'm
going,"to get into more tools,"
3500.96,but to satisfy you and to
make,sure that you do indeed
3505.36,understand that
there,are tools that
3506.86,can emerge from the information
that,you already now
3509.23,have in mind.
3510.13,I do want to share with
you,one particular tool
3512.23,from the literature that
has,been demonstrated over
3515.86,and over again to support
and,build and enhance
3519.85,divergent thinking.
3521.475,And I also want
to,share with you
3522.85,a tool that has been shown
from,the scientific literature
3525.225,to enhance convergent thinking
because,both convergent and
3527.83,divergent thinking are critical
for,the creative process.
3530.6,"Now, I should emphasize"
that,some people out there
3535.63,either by training or
by,genetics or by both
3538.63,will be naturally better
at,divergent or convergent
3542.86,thinking.
3543.55,"And in fact, we now know"
in,almost poetic way
3548.56,that naturally
occurring,variations
3551.38,in genes which underlie
naturally,occurring variations
3555.01,in the percentage of
dopamine,in one set of brain
3560.23,"circuits versus another do,"
seem,to relate to whether or not
3564.01,people are naturally good
at,divergent thinking
3566.32,or convergent thinking.
3567.64,"Now, that's a very"
nature,based explanation
3571.143,for why some people are
better,at divergent thinking
3573.31,and other people are better
at,convergent thinking.
3576.72,Nature and nurture is
something,that can never really
3579.15,"be teased apart exactly because,"
of,"course, if someone has"
3582.15,a natural proclivity for
something,"based on their genes,"
3584.55,you can't often separate
that,from their parents
3588.18,because we inherit our
genes,from our parents
3591.0,although even in cases
where,people are raised away
3593.37,from their parents through
"adoption,",et cetera.
3597.06,It's very hard to separate
nature,and nurture
3599.172,because somebody with a
natural,proclivity for things
3601.38,might engage in those things
"more,","et cetera, et cetera."
3604.11,The point is that
for,those of you that
3606.12,"are very, very good"
at,divergent thinking
3608.28,"or very, very good at convergent"
"thinking,",some of that
3611.07,might have been inherited.
3612.72,But more than likely some of
that,depended on the activities
3616.05,that you engaged in
in,"your early years,"
3619.38,in particular in the years
between,age 5 and 25.
3623.31,And for those of you that
are,"aged between 5 and 25,"
3626.85,all I can say is
please,learn to engage
3629.28,both divergent and convergent
thinking,as much as
3631.477,possible because you will
enhance,your ability for both.
3633.81,For those of you
25,"and older, you"
3635.76,can still enhance
your,ability to engage
3637.86,divergent and
convergent,thinking.
3639.39,"And the fortunate news,"
the,equalizer I should say
3643.35,is that regardless
of,whether or not
3645.45,you're a naturally better
at,divergent or convergent
3647.76,thinking or you acquired
it,"through activities,"
3650.16,you need both in
order,to be creative.
3652.33,So what we know is that in order
to,"engage divergent thinking,"
3655.02,we need access to
our,memory banks.
3656.94,We need to come up
with,possibilities.
3658.668,And those possibilities
can,only come
3660.21,from what's contained within
our,memory systems of our brain.
3664.377,Areas like the
"hippocampus,",et cetera.
3665.96,But the names
again,don't matter.
3667.43,We just know that
if,we are going
3669.23,to come up with novel
combinations,of things or novel
3671.99,uses of things or totally
new,ideas about how
3674.81,objects or notes of
music,or foods or tastes
3677.57,or whatever can be
"combined,",we have
3680.03,to do that with
pre-existing,knowledge.
3681.69,And yet what we
need,to do in order
3683.36,to engage divergent
thinking,is suppress
3686.78,what is called
autobiographical,narratives
3690.14,"and in particular,"
autobiographical,narratives.
3692.33,We need to discard
with,judgments
3695.09,about how certain
combinations,of things
3698.03,impacted us in the past.
3699.95,This here I think
is,what people mean
3701.9,when they encourage the
exploration,of creativity
3704.84,by so-called
boundary,exploration.
3706.97,You hear about this a
lot,"in the self-help,"
3708.83,in psychology literature.
3710.03,And I'm not at all
disparaging,of that literature
3712.1,although rarely does it define
exactly,how and why to go
3715.7,about being more
creative,or in this case
3717.8,to be more divergent
in,our thinking.
3720.62,"So they'll say, you"
have,to take risks
3722.75,or you have to
suppress,judgment.
3725.09,But how do you actually do that?
3726.66,"Well, there's a wonderful"
paper,that talks about one way
3729.8,to do it.
3730.37,One way to do it is what's
called,open monitoring
3733.28,meditation or even just
open,monitoring thinking.
3736.118,And just to make
what,could otherwise
3737.66,be a somewhat complex
section,here very simple.
3740.847,What I'll also tell
you,is that if you
3742.43,want to enhance
convergent,"thinking,"
3744.92,you can do that
a,"number of ways,"
3747.35,but you can do that
in,particular by doing
3749.57,a different type of meditation
or,"thought process, which"
3753.23,is called focused
attention,meditation.
3755.58,So let's talk about open
monitoring,meditation
3757.68,and why it's so
useful,for enhancing
3759.23,"divergent thinking,"
this,critical element
3761.0,of the creative process.
3763.62,"First of all, open"
monitoring,meditation
3765.8,and focused attention
meditation,can be performed
3770.04,the exact same way physically.
3772.1,"You can sit there,"
eyes,"closed, I"
3774.172,don't care if you're
in,"a Lotus position,"
3775.88,"it doesn't really matter, you're"
lying,"down, you're standing up."
3778.547,You could in theory do open
monitoring,meditation with eyes
3781.46,open and that would be an
interesting,variant on it.
3783.87,But for sake of the
discussion,right
3786.05,"now, let's just"
focus,on the study
3787.52,that talks about these
specific,tools and the way
3791.42,that they were
used,in the study.
3793.32,The title of the paper that
I'm,essentially summarizing
3796.07,is called open monitoring
meditation,reduces
3798.56,the involvement of brain regions
related,to memory function.
3801.66,"Now, right off the"
bat,that will cue you
3803.36,to something interesting.
3804.51,Something about divergent
thinking,and open monitoring
3807.17,is related to
suppressing,memory.
3809.99,"But as you recall,"
just,"a few moments ago,"
3812.39,I said that in order to
engage,"in divergent thinking,"
3815.22,you need to kill off
the,narratives of what
3819.35,has to be related to what and
come,up with new narratives.
3821.81,You still need to
understand,possibilities
3823.97,but you need to forget
prior,understanding of what
3827.11,those possibilities have to be
and,start thinking about what
3829.61,those possibilities could be.
3831.3,And so that it turns
out,involves suppression
3833.3,of certain brain areas.
3835.43,Open monitoring
meditation,is typically
3837.62,done for about 10 to 30 minutes
although,it could be longer.
3841.46,And unlike other
forms,of meditation
3843.95,where you sit and
concentrate,on your breathing
3846.59,and trying to redirect your
thinking,back to your breathing
3849.35,or to your posture or
to,"a chant or a mantra,"
3854.03,open monitoring
meditation,is simply
3856.79,a matter of having sit there
or,lie down and close your eyes
3859.94,and to allow whatever surfaces
in,your mind to surface.
3864.05,And what you practice is
the,practice of nonjudgment.
3867.95,"Now, nonjudgment itself is a"
little,bit of an abstract theme
3870.47,"because, of course, the"
moment,you say don't judge you
3873.68,and others start to judge.
3874.82,It's just the way
that,the brain works.
3876.02,"You say, don't think"
about,an elephant
3877.49,you think about an elephant.
3878.27,That's a perfectly natural.
3879.395,You go to an edge of a bridge
or,a cliff and you think about
3882.823,jumping off even
though,you don't.
3884.24,Please don't jump off.
3885.343,And that's because it's
part,of the circuitry that's
3887.51,keeping you from jumping off.
3888.68,Is the thought about what
would,happen if you did.
3890.39,OK?
3891.02,So open monitoring
meditation,involves
3893.51,dedicating a certain amount of
time,where you close your eyes
3896.27,"and whatever thoughts arise,"
whatever,"emotions arise,"
3899.48,whatever ideas arise
to,watch those and take
3903.38,an inventory of them to just
merely,watch them show up
3906.74,and pass or maybe become fixated
on,them for some period of time
3910.098,or maybe even just one
for,a long period of time.
3912.14,All of that is fine.
3913.32,"In other words, whatever"
surfaces,surfaces.
3916.07,That's open
monitoring,meditation.
3917.84,And that we know from
brain,imaging studies
3920.3,and we know from
measurements,"of dopamine,"
3922.28,in particular brain circuits and
we,know from people who train
3926.63,with open monitoring
meditation,on a regular basis
3930.41,improves divergent
thinking,capability.
3933.6,"So in terms of tools, practicing"
open,monitoring meditation
3937.64,or what I would just call
open,monitoring thinking
3940.37,is going to be immensely useful.
3942.53,And this is actually
an,opportunity
3944.15,to queue up something that
I,mentioned in our episode
3946.358,"on meditation, which goes deep"
into,the different meditation
3949.01,involving focus inward
and,"outward, et cetera."
3951.122,You're welcome to
check,out that episode.
3952.83,It's at hubermanlab.com.
3954.29,But the point is that rather
than,think about the word
3958.22,"meditation, which carries a"
bunch,of ideas about what it is
3962.03,and what it isn't
and,"how to do it,"
3964.27,meditation is really just
a,perceptual exercise.
3966.815,"For instance, you"
could,do a meditation
3968.44,where you look at a single
point,on a wall for five minutes
3971.71,and redirect your focus to that
single,point on a wall over
3974.332,and over again
every,time your mind
3975.79,drifts as it no doubt would.
3977.38,Or to a tone in the room.
3979.06,You could attend to that
and,redirect to that.
3981.1,Rather than think about
it,"as a meditation,"
3982.892,it's really just a
perceptual,exercise.
3984.74,That's all that meditation is.
3986.53,So open monitoring
meditation,is really
3988.72,just a form of perception
where,"you're paying attention,"
3991.27,you're perceiving your thoughts
without,laying judgment
3994.51,to those thoughts or
trying,not to lay judgment
3996.67,to those thoughts.
3997.42,And what people
find,is that they
3998.795,very quickly within
a,few days get better
4000.78,at doing open
monitoring,meditation.
4002.31,"And fortunately,"
within,just a few days
4005.04,and certainly within about a
week,or more of practice and it
4008.4,doesn't even have to
be,daily practice.
4010.31,"So although, of"
"course,",daily practice
4012.0,will accelerate the
process,"further,"
4013.56,people become significantly
better,at divergent thinking.
4016.778,And that's because of
the,dopamine circuits
4018.57,"and in particular, along"
the,nigrostriatal pathway
4021.45,becoming more active.
4022.5,And the wonderful
thing,is that when
4024.12,you repeat a practice and
a,particular neural circuit
4027.21,is engaged over and
over,"again deliberately,"
4029.52,that neural circuit
becomes,easier to engage.
4031.96,So-called neuroplasticity.
4033.87,So I would encourage
any,of you that
4036.9,want to explore the creative
process,for whatever reason
4039.96,or get better the
creative,"process,"
4041.52,dedicate some amount of time.
4043.14,Maybe even just five
minutes,every other day
4045.84,to doing this open
monitoring,meditation.
4047.97,I've tried this meditation.
4049.29,It's actually quite fun to
do,because at least to me
4053.47,it feels a lot easier than
the,meditation associated
4057.33,with convergent thinking.
4058.71,"Now, the convergent"
thinking,meditation
4061.05,is the so-called focus
attention,meditation.
4063.55,And that's also described
in,the same study.
4065.49,And other studies have
explored,which particular brain
4068.43,networks it involves.
4069.75,And I can just tell
you,that focused
4072.06,"attention meditation,"
which,you can think of
4074.37,or I'd prefer that you think of
just,as a perceptual exercise
4077.13,involves sitting or lying
"down,","closing your eyes,"
4079.68,"focusing either on your breath,"
or,some element of your body.
4083.25,Could be the tops of your knees
or,the clasp of your hands.
4087.48,It could be focusing
on,"an auditory tone,"
4090.51,you could even do it eyes open
and,stare at a point on a wall
4094.23,or a flame of light.
4095.46,Whatever it happens
to,be that allows
4097.26,you to redirect your focus to
a,particular location or idea
4100.859,or sound.
4102.21,That is known to
improve,your ability
4106.62,to engage convergent
"thinking,",to quickly
4110.01,parse through or analyze a
bunch,"of different choices,"
4114.33,and to persist in
choice,selection
4118.47,and therefore more rapidly
arrive,at the correct answer.
4121.45,This is well-established
"and,","in fact, in, the episode"
4123.7,I did with a wonderful
guest,Dr. Wendy Suzuki
4125.832,from New York
University,she talked
4127.29,about how a daily meditation
of,about 10 to 13 minutes
4130.77,performed for about eight weeks.
4132.12,That's what they explore.
4133.162,And that study greatly
increases,people's ability
4135.359,to focus and in
"fact,",their memory.
4137.981,And that's exactly
the,"point, which"
4139.439,is that convergent thinking as
I,"mentioned before, it requires"
4142.022,"persistence, focus, and"
access,to specific memories.
4146.102,So if you are somebody who
wants,"to get better at focusing,"
4148.56,that is the meditation for you.
4150.21,"However, because today we're"
talking,"about creativity,"
4153.277,if you are somebody
who,wants to get better
4155.069,at divergent thinking
and,"convergent thinking,"
4157.2,the two elements of creativity.
4158.76,"That is, I would encourage"
you,to do a dual meditation.
4163.17,"That is, a meditation"
that,starts
4165.27,with open monitoring for
maybe,5 to 10 minutes
4169.05,and then transitions to
focused,attention for maybe
4173.46,5 to 10 minutes.
4174.51,Because the positioning
of,divergent thinking
4178.5,and then convergent thinking
close,"together, more closely"
4181.68,resembles what the
creative,process really is
4184.439,and what it typically involves.
4185.88,Most of us would love to
have,a situation where
4188.88,we can spend a morning or a
day,or a week brainstorming.
4192.66,Just brainstorming.
4193.62,Whatever we think about is fine.
4195.117,That's divergent thinking.
4196.2,Whatever elements just throw
them,up on the whiteboard.
4198.66,We sometimes see
people,and companies
4200.31,doing this at retreats.
4201.57,You bring people into
a,novel environment.
4203.55,"You say, let's just"
forget,all the rules
4205.217,and let's just come up with
new,ideas about something.
4208.67,"New uses of something,"
new,strategies.
4210.93,And nothing is too crazy.
4212.79,Nothing is off limits.
4213.75,"And sure, that's"
a,useful exercise
4215.7,so-called brainstorming.
4216.99,"But at some point,"
there's,the requirement
4219.24,to cross off things.
4220.143,And typically that's
done,later in the retreat
4222.06,or later in the meeting
or,later in the weekend.
4224.71,And that's a wonderful
way,to approach creativity
4227.79,and to try and be creative.
4229.14,But not a lot of people train
for,that on a regular basis.
4232.51,So what I just
described,to you are
4234.15,research tested
tools,for training
4236.002,for divergent thinking
and,convergent thinking.
4237.96,And I would encourage
people,who are
4239.46,interested in being more
creative,to try and do these
4242.49,on a somewhat regular basis.
4243.97,If not every day then certainly
a,few times a week or more.
4247.56,Certainly the more
you,"do it, the better"
4249.492,you're going to get it.
4250.45,That's well demonstrated
in,the literature.
4252.45,And if you're somebody
who's,very consistent doing
4254.533,maybe five minutes of open
monitoring,meditation and five
4257.44,minutes immediately
after,of focus attention
4259.77,"meditation daily, you"
can,expect that you
4261.87,"will get very, very good"
at,"these processes very,"
4265.52,very quickly.
4266.45,"Now, I'm not going to go"
into,a lengthy description
4268.75,of the different lines of
evidence,that the corresponding
4272.62,areas of the brain are active
in,each of these different .
4275.11,Meditation but
what,I can tell you
4276.918,is that there have been
some,beautiful what
4278.71,are called loss of
function,studies
4280.81,where particular brain areas
are,either depleted of dopamine
4284.62,or where dopamine
in,some cases I
4286.298,guess what we would call
gain,of function studies
4288.34,although not the gain
of,function studies
4290.08,associated with virology
different,gain of function
4292.205,studies where you enhance the
level,of dopamine in the brain.
4294.86,What you find is that both
divergent,and convergent
4298.3,thinking are enhanced
when,levels of dopamine
4302.35,are elevated.
4303.46,"Now, we're not necessarily"
talking,about pharmacology
4306.05,here.
4306.55,It turns out that
there,are other ways
4308.17,to elevate dopamine
that,make us better
4310.27,at divergent and convergent
thinking,"in particular,"
4313.81,by using mood.
4315.49,And now I'd like to
talk,about what mood you
4319.09,are in when you happen to
start,"a creative process,"
4322.31,or try and do a training such
as,open monitoring meditation
4326.68,or focused meditation.
4327.97,How your mood relates to your
level,of dopamine at baseline.
4332.3,What we call your
tonic,"as it's called,"
4334.61,meaning consistent or
ongoing,"level of dopamine,"
4338.44,how that dictates whether or
not,you are going to be better
4341.44,at one particular aspect of
the,creative process or another
4344.71,and how you can enhance
your,creativity in the very
4347.89,"short term, very quickly using"
tools,that are known to trigger
4352.06,"additional release of dopamine,"
which,in some cases is good
4354.94,and in some cases is
"bad,",I should mention.
4357.43,"And in other words,"
determine,how
4361.18,you feel in one
moment,should dictate
4363.79,what tool you should use in
order,to become more creative.
4367.27,The relationship between
mood,and creativity
4370.18,is a fascinating
one,that is bridged
4372.85,"by one main feature, which is"
the,amount of dopamine present
4376.84,in this nigrostriatal pathway.
4378.85,And there's a really
wonderful,correlate
4380.95,or measure of the
amount,of dopamine
4383.41,that's active in
that,pathway that
4385.3,can be addressed noninvasively
in,the laboratory.
4388.54,"As I mentioned, the"
nigrostriatal,pathway
4390.25,is involved in movement
and,"in eye blinking which,"
4394.338,"of course, is a movement."
4395.38,It's not a movement of
the,sort that we typically
4397.09,think of when we
think,"of movements,"
4398.59,but nonetheless it
relies,on dopamine levels
4400.51,in this pathway.
4401.41,"And in fact, we can"
state,very confidently
4404.29,that when dopamine
levels,"are elevated,"
4406.9,the blinking reflex
is,more active.
4409.36,People just blink more.
4410.44,When dopamine levels are lower
or,"less active in this pathway,"
4413.92,people tend to blink less.
4415.42,So blink frequency
is,a common measure
4418.75,in studies of dopamine
within,this pathway that
4422.35,relate to creativity.
4424.09,The work that I'm
about,to describe
4425.65,is largely the
work,of two authors
4427.51,who have done wonderful
work,across several papers.
4430.54,"Unfortunately,"
for,me their names
4431.935,are difficult to pronounce.
4433.06,So I apologize to them
and,their relatives
4434.81,for what is sure to be
incorrect,pronunciation.
4437.89,But the last names
of,these authors
4440.23,are Chermahini and Hommel.
4442.765,They're in the Netherlands.
4443.89,So Chermahini and Hommel done
a,number of different papers
4447.37,or studies rather
of,the relationship
4449.35,"between blinking,"
"mood,",and creativity
4451.78,"in particular,"
divergent,thinking.
4453.73,What they found is that
if,people are blinking
4456.01,fairly often and they
measure,their mood
4458.2,through subjective
tests,and if they
4460.09,"were to do brain imaging,"
which,"other studies have done,"
4462.64,they find is that
those,people can
4464.14,engage in divergent
thinking,very easily.
4467.56,"In other words,"
being,in a good mood
4469.99,facilitates divergent thinking.
4472.66,"Now, some of you might"
immediately,"say, well, duh,"
4475.15,if you're in a good
mood,you can be
4476.68,more playful about the
exploration,about what
4478.99,could happen with
these,notes of music
4480.76,"or these foods, et cetera."
4482.35,But it's not so obvious.
4483.58,Because it turns out that if
your,"dopamine levels are very,"
4486.77,"very high, and this can"
be,measured noninvasively
4490.828,through the frequency
of,blinks or it
4492.37,can be measured more invasively
through,brain imaging
4494.86,even through blood
draws,or other methods
4497.14,to measure dopamine.
4498.04,"If dopamine levels are very,"
very,"high, what you observe"
4501.37,is that divergent thinking
is,"actually very, very poor."
4504.37,"Now, a naturally occurring"
truly,"pathological example,"
4508.06,this would be something
like,manic bipolar disorder
4510.49,where somebody is in the
manic,phase or somebody who
4513.1,has taken methamphetamine or
"cocaine,",what tends to happen
4516.58,is that they have lots and lots
of,"ideas, all of those ideas"
4519.73,seem really exciting to them.
4521.182,But if you were to talk to
them,"for any given moment,"
4523.39,they would be very fixated on
one,particular tunnel of ideas.
4527.38,And by being fixated on one
particular,tunnel of ideas
4530.095,like the idea that they're going
to,"run for president tomorrow,"
4532.72,this is unfortunately
typical,of people
4535.847,"who have bipolar, which is"
not,to say that everybody who
4538.18,runs for president is bipolar
rather,people who are bipolar
4541.21,often have these
delusions,of grandeur
4543.158,that they're somehow going
to,be president simply
4545.2,because they decided to and that
they,"were selected to do this,"
4547.45,"et cetera, et cetera."
4548.645,Ideas about themselves
and,other people
4550.27,that are very constrained.
4551.95,"In other words,"
not,very divergent.
4554.12,So divergent thinking is favored
by,having elevated levels
4557.65,of dopamine but not too high.
4560.908,"Well, that, of course,"
creates,a conundrum.
4562.7,How do you know how
much,dopamine you need
4564.71,and how to achieve those
elevated,levels of dopamine.
4567.08,"Well, leaving aside"
people,who are suffering
4569.33,from a manic episode what
Chermahini,and Hommel have
4573.98,discovered is that if
people,"are in a low mood,"
4578.18,"they're not feeling great,"
maybe,they're depressed
4580.4,but they're just not
feeling,that great.
4582.067,"They feel on a scale of 1 to 10,"
around,"a 2, or a 3, maybe a 4."
4585.83,The probability
that,they will be
4587.39,able to engage effectively
in,divergent thinking
4590.24,is quite low.
4591.57,"However, the good news"
"is,",they are typically
4594.59,very susceptible to
elevations,in mood
4598.13,through observing or
hearing,"positive stories,"
4602.43,listening to music
that,"they like,"
4604.31,any kind of so-called
inspirational,stimuli.
4607.102,"Now, this is good news."
4608.06,What this means
is,that if you're
4609.435,somebody who's not feeling
very,motivated to engage
4611.907,"in divergent thinking, you're"
not,"feeling very creative,"
4614.24,you're feeling a little low.
4616.07,The thing to do in
that,case is actually
4618.41,to take external stimuli.
4620.39,Things that you like and start
interacting,with those stimuli
4623.81,to get your mood elevated
and,then to engage
4625.85,in divergent thinking.
4627.26,"However, what Chermahini"
and,Hommel have also shown
4631.55,is that if people are
already,"in a very good mood,"
4637.58,elevating dopamine
further,is not conducive.
4640.37,"And in fact, is detrimental"
to,divergent thinking.
4643.34,"And in that case, they would"
be,"better off for example,"
4647.51,not engaging in any
activities,or taking anything
4652.25,in the way of pharmacology
that,would further
4654.14,increase their dopamine.
4655.61,And probably limiting the
amount,of external stimuli
4658.94,that are coming in through
music,and visual stimuli
4661.49,and really focusing
on,divergent thinking
4663.62,and the creative
process,immediately.
4665.85,"Now, this is important."
4667.1,In an earlier episode
both,on bipolar
4669.29,and on other forms
of,"depression,"
4670.88,I talked about how rates
of,bipolar manic episodes
4676.37,and dopamine levels
and,creativity
4679.31,tend to be correlated.
4680.85,"Now, unfortunately, rates of"
suicide,are 20 to 30 times
4684.2,higher in people who have
bipolar,disorder as well.
4686.7,And so there's a whole dark
side,to the bipolar disorder
4689.167,"that makes it a very, very"
dangerous,and important
4691.25,disorder to treat.
4692.99,But for sake of the
discussion,"of creativity,"
4696.44,what this means is
that,we all need
4698.51,to develop some
intuitive,sense as to
4700.31,whether or not our mood is--
4703.04,suppose we could spin this into
three,categories is kind of--
4706.46,"yes, happy, excited, positive"
"mood,","and, of course,"
4710.16,there are going to
be,levels to that.
4712.01,"Low like, mmmh, or"
meh,in the middle.
4716.1,So if you're in a
low,"mood or meh mood,"
4718.82,by all means engage
in,something probably
4721.49,for about 5 to 30
minutes,that elevates
4723.83,your mood before trying to
engage,in divergent thinking.
4726.41,"However, if you happen to be"
in,"a pretty positive mood,"
4728.84,even if you're not 10
out,"of 10 on mood, then"
4731.66,bringing in additional
stimuli,to increase
4735.08,your levels of dopamine
will,not help you
4737.24,and in fact can hurt the
divergent,thinking process.
4740.22,"So in that case, I"
would,also encourage
4742.43,you to think about
something,that
4743.93,was discussed on a
previous,"episode, which"
4745.73,is the particular
effects,of caffeine.
4747.86,I'll get into caffeine
a,little bit later.
4749.7,"But just very briefly,"
caffeine,increases
4752.84,levels of dopamine receptors.
4754.71,So it's not the caffeine is bad.
4756.082,"In fact, caffeine can"
be,"neuroprotective,"
4757.79,it can enhance
focus,and so forth.
4759.81,But divergent thinking
is,anti focus.
4762.74,It requires just
enough,focus to be
4764.24,able to come up with new ideas.
4766.19,But you actually don't
want,to be overly focused.
4768.68,Focus is more conducive
to,convergent thinking.
4771.058,"In fact, that's exactly"
what,the literature
4772.85,"shows, is that caffeine because"
its,effects on epinephrine
4776.24,and related systems in
the,brain like adenosine.
4778.64,But mainly because
of,its effects
4780.26,on persistence and
focus,is very conducive
4783.26,to convergent thinking.
4784.82,So if you're somebody who
wants,to explore creativity
4788.18,and wants to get
better,"at creativity,"
4789.83,you now know that
you,need to engage
4791.51,in divergent thinking and then
afterwards,convergent thinking.
4795.89,I would recommend not using
stimulants,such as caffeine
4799.37,prior to divergent thinking
but,rather use stimulants
4802.94,if you do want to use
stimulants,such as caffeine
4805.49,prior to convergent thinking.
4807.59,"And in fact, in formulating"
the,architecture
4810.47,"of today's episode,"
which,took me
4812.75,many hours across many
different,"days I confess,"
4815.36,I actually decided to try this.
4817.1,In trying to imagine the
different,configurations
4819.47,and ways that this
information,"can be organized,"
4821.667,I deliberately
abstained,from caffeine
4823.25,during those bouts of work.
4824.75,And when structuring
everything,according
4827.66,to the decisions I
had,"already made,"
4830.03,I purposely ingested
caffeine,prior to that.
4833.07,"Now, of course, constructing"
a,podcast episode
4836.36,is not really the ultimate
example,of a creative act
4840.062,"because, of course, it's"
taking,existing information.
4842.27,It's arranging in a novel ways.
4843.562,But it doesn't necessarily
allow,key concepts
4845.93,to pop out in the way
"that,","for instance,"
4848.21,Banksy or a Rothko or
an,Escher would pop out.
4851.33,I'm certainly not naive
in,thinking that it does.
4853.85,But the principle of is
what's,important here.
4857.403,You need divergent thinking.
4858.57,You need convergent thinking.
4859.778,You need some level
of,elevated dopamine
4862.19,in order to engage in
divergent,thinking.
4865.01,But not so high that it starts
to,inhibit that process.
4868.025,"Now, if you were to come"
into,"the laboratory,"
4869.9,this could be measured by
your,frequency of blinking.
4872.5,For better or for
"worse,",we can't actually
4874.25,count the number of times that
we,blink unless we're actively
4876.86,paying attention to it.
4877.74,So I don't recommend that you
pay,attention to your blinking
4879.38,because that will take
you,off course from all
4881.09,the other important
things,of your life.
4882.86,And how many times
you're,blinking
4884.42,is rarely an important thing
for,you to pay attention to.
4887.72,"You can however, learn to"
calibrate,"your mood that is,"
4891.14,to assess your mood whether
or,"not you're in low, medium,"
4894.93,or high mood.
4896.0,No problem using
that,broad binning.
4898.67,You could scale it on 1 to 10.
4899.92,And then decide
whether,or not you're
4901.462,going to use some
dopamine,elevating
4903.05,stimulus from the outside.
4904.28,"Again, could be music, could be"
"exercise,",is an excellent way
4907.657,to elevate dopamine.
4908.49,I'll talk about another
well-established,one
4910.43,from the research
literature,that
4912.32,is known to elevate dopamine by
65%,in the particular pathway
4917.99,that's relevant for
divergent,thinking
4920.12,and to do that without
any,pharmacology.
4921.908,I'll share that with
you,in a moment.
4923.45,But you need to decide
for,you in a given moment
4926.99,or in a given work attempt
at,creativity what you need
4930.62,and apply accordingly.
4931.86,Because as Chermahini and Hommel
have,"shown, whether or not"
4936.23,"you are in a low mood,"
medium,"mood, or high mood,"
4938.972,really can determine
whether,or not
4940.43,you'll be able to access
divergent,thinking or not.
4943.58,"Now, if you're somebody who"
already,"has an idea in mind,"
4946.43,you're very excited
about,a creative idea
4948.26,"and you want to hone it,"
you,"want to shape it,"
4950.82,you want to pressure test it.
4952.26,We'll talk a little
bit,more about what
4953.885,that means in a three step
process,in just a little bit.
4957.69,I would strongly
encourage,you to look
4960.48,at that process is a very
linear,process in which there
4963.42,are right and wrong answers.
4965.38,"And there, the use of caffeine"
at,appropriate dosages
4968.61,and dosages for
caffeine,that are safe
4970.83,"and in fact,"
performance,enhancing
4972.33,were covered in the
episode,on caffeine turns
4974.205,out it's 1 to 3 milligrams
per,"kilogram of body weight,"
4977.47,by the way.
4978.27,And if you want to
leverage,caffeine or maybe
4981.21,even other forms of
healthy,"legal stimulants,"
4984.75,those are covered in
the,caffeine episode.
4986.5,And I'll talk about a few
more,a little bit later.
4988.583,So to summarize this
segment,and also
4990.203,just to make a
more,"general point,"
4991.62,I think it's very
useful,for people
4993.09,to start to pay attention to
what,"their tonic level, that"
4996.66,is their baseline
level,of dopamine
4998.94,ought to be in this
nigrostriatal,circuit
5002.6,and in other circuits.
5003.56,And to do that by learning
to,assess one's mood
5006.14,and pay attention to what
mood,they happen to be in.
5009.02,And then to leverage tools.
5010.49,"Behavioral tools, maybe"
pharmacologic,tools
5012.405,provided they're safe
and,they're legal
5014.03,in order to either
increase,dopamine
5016.64,or to elect not to
increase,dopamine in order
5019.55,to access the creative process.
5021.195,"Now, I've mentioned"
pharmacology,a few times.
5023.07,And I'd like to talk about
that,just a little bit more
5025.32,in the context of dopamine.
5026.78,"First of all, there is"
no,supplement or drug
5030.89,that you or anyone else can
take,that will selectively
5035.33,elevate dopamine in only
one,of the four circuits
5039.23,that I described before.
5040.73,This is just the state of
the,technology nowadays.
5043.19,If you take a pill
or,even if you
5045.14,were to inject some
"substance,","again, I"
5046.94,hope this would be legal
and,"safe, et cetera."
5050.36,"Whatever mode of delivery,"
there,is no technology
5053.84,that exists at this time that
would,allow you to selectively
5057.23,amplify dopamine.
5058.46,"For instance, just in the"
nigrostriatal,pathway or just
5061.688,in the means of
mesocortical,pathway.
5063.23,"Again, the nigrostriatal"
pathway,associated
5065.022,"with diversion thinking, the"
music,mesocortical pathway
5067.37,associated with cognitive
persistence,and convergent
5070.43,thinking.
5072.12,If you were to amplify
dopamine,"levels, for instance,"
5074.79,by taking the amino
acid,precursor
5076.56,to dopamine
"L-Tyrosine,",something
5078.27,that I occasionally
do,to enhance
5079.86,dopamine levels for
sake,"of work or energy,"
5082.02,"500 milligrams or 1,000"
milligrams,even of L-Tyrosine.
5085.02,Sometimes I'll combine that with
other,things like Alpha-GPC.
5087.63,It's going to enhance
dopamine,transmission
5090.45,"in the nigrostriatal pathway,"
the,"mesocortical pathway,"
5093.48,but also in the
mesolimbic,"pathway,"
5095.13,"and also, for that matter in"
the,tuberoinfundibular pathway
5098.35,associated with the pituitary.
5099.6,There is no way to direct
dopamine,activation
5103.11,to just one of those pathways.
5105.19,That's just a reflection
of,the existing technology.
5108.22,"Now, this is also true if"
you,rely on illicit drugs
5112.14,to increase dopamine.
5113.05,So if it's cocaine
or,"methamphetamine,"
5114.633,those will greatly increase
dopamine,but nonselectively
5118.38,across all those
different,pathways.
5120.54,And likewise with any drugs that
inhibit,or block or antagonize
5125.01,as it's called dopamine.
5126.6,"This is why people who, for"
"instance,",have schizophrenia
5129.78,and take drugs to suppress
auditory,"hallucinations, some"
5133.35,of those drugs work because they
block,the so-called D2 receptor
5137.45,of the dopamine pathway.
5138.45,D2 receptors are
present,in all four
5140.76,of the dopaminergic
pathways,in the brain.
5142.68,"And oftentimes, those"
drugs,will in fact
5145.47,"suppress psychotic symptoms,"
auditory,"hallucinations,"
5147.78,"et cetera, because"
they,reduce dopamine.
5149.76,But those people oftentimes will
have,problems with movement.
5152.85,They will express what's called
in,the clinical literature
5155.91,tardive dyskinesia.
5157.71,Writhing of the
face,and the body
5159.9,from suppression
of,dopamine within
5162.698,"the nigrostriatal pathway, which"
is,associated with movement.
5165.24,They will sometimes have
deficits,in eye blinking.
5167.82,People with Parkinson's
who,actually
5169.83,have selective deficits of
dopamine,within the substantia
5173.04,nigra.
5173.73,"Nigrostriatal, remember,"
it's,substantia nigra
5176.13,show deficits in what?
5177.435,In movement.
5178.18,In the smoothness of movement.
5179.43,Oftentimes they
won't,blink at all.
5181.29,They'll have a blank stare.
5182.82,And they have other
issues,as well.
5184.69,So if you're somebody who
is,interested in increasing
5187.83,dopamine through the use
of,legal safe pharmacology
5191.43,as I would hope it
would,"be the case,"
5193.93,there are ways to
do,"that, reasonably"
5195.78,safely for most people.
5196.74,"Again, people with"
bipolar,"disorder issues,"
5198.66,with the dopaminergic
pathway,should not do this.
5200.85,I know nowadays there's
a,lot of use of drugs
5204.39,that increase dopamine such as
"Ritalin,","Adderall, modafinil,"
5210.51,"armodafinil, often prescribed"
for,things like attention
5213.63,deficit hyperactivity disorder.
5214.98,We did an entire episode
on,"ADHD and pharmacologic,"
5217.86,"prescription, supplement, and"
"behavioral,",nutritional tools
5220.77,for ADHD.
5221.4,You can find that episode
at,hubermanlab.com.
5223.77,I know a number of people
take,those compounds in order
5226.59,to increase dopamine and
focus,for sake of studying
5231.03,or other activities staying
up,"long hours, et cetera."
5234.12,And the fact that
they,"increase focus,"
5235.95,they are effective although
they,do have their side effects.
5238.86,"Sometimes severe, sometimes"
habit,"forming, sometimes"
5241.47,even addicting as well.
5242.898,But the fact that
they,increase focus
5244.44,should automatically
tell,you something
5246.27,that those drugs in
particular,increase
5249.54,dopamine in the
so-called,mesocortical
5253.86,and mesolimbic pathways.
5255.75,Why can I say that?
5257.128,How can I say that with
any,degree of confidence?
5259.17,"Well, there are these four"
pathways,ones involved
5261.33,"in movement, but"
these,other ones
5263.73,are involved in motivation
and,desire and reward.
5266.85,And I told you that
these,things can
5268.35,be habit forming and
addicting,in some cases
5270.21,and they are can
greatly,increase focus.
5272.91,And focus is supported by
enhanced,levels of dopamine
5276.78,within this mesolimbic
and,mesocortical pathway.
5280.66,"So yes, those drugs increase"
dopamine,"across the board,"
5283.5,but there does seem to be
some,weighting of dopamine
5285.96,toward the systems involved
in,motivation and reward
5288.66,and sometimes even leading to
habit,formation and addiction.
5291.27,That's why those
drugs,should only
5293.67,be taken with the close
supervision,of a very
5297.48,skilled psychiatrist or somebody
else,who's board certified
5300.75,who can really govern that.
5303.33,"There are however, ways"
to,increase dopamine
5306.03,more evenly across the
board,using nonprescription
5308.77,approaches.
5309.27,And one I already
"mentioned,",which
5310.74,is L-Tyrosine taken
typically,in dosages
5313.44,"of 500 to 1,000 milligrams."
5315.12,L-Tyrosine is not as potent
in,increasing dopamine
5318.18,as are the prescription drugs
that,I referred to before.
5322.5,Tends to be milder.
5323.49,For some people it can have
a,very amplified effect.
5325.95,They feel it right away.
5327.01,It's very intense in
elevating,focus and motivation
5330.42,and the desire to move.
5332.4,"For other people,"
it's,less potent.
5335.053,It really depends on
a,number of things.
5336.72,I should mention that regular
consumption,of caffeine
5339.54,of 1 to 3 milligrams per
kilogram,of body weight per day
5342.54,also will increase dopamine
receptor,"efficacy and density,"
5346.78,which will make any existing
dopamine,more effective
5349.95,whether or not that dopamine
is,triggered by things
5352.26,"like L-Tyrosine, or if"
you're,not taking anything
5354.63,to elevate dopamine.
5355.72,The dopamine that
you,do make will
5357.21,be more effective in elevating
your,"mood, motivation,"
5360.57,and desire to move.
5362.52,And by extension
divergent,thinking.
5364.95,If you are consuming
"caffeine,","but, again, caffeine"
5367.44,should be taken prior to
convergent,thinking type task
5369.69,probably more than it
should,be taken prior
5371.77,to divergent thinking task.
5373.3,"And, of course, there are"
other,legal supplements
5375.67,that can elevate
dopamine,as well
5377.08,and particular phenethylamine
is,very effective in doing that.
5379.96,600 milligrams of that
has,a brief effect lasting
5383.44,only about 30 to 45 minutes.
5384.982,But it is one that
many,people find
5386.44,beneficial for sake of studying
or,for creative thinking
5389.44,and so on and so forth.
5390.65,"Now, that's pharmacology."
5391.93,"And in fact, there's"
an,extensive landscape
5394.028,of prescription and
supplement,based pharmacology
5396.07,and indeed nutrition.
5397.9,"For instance, the"
consumption,of foods
5399.76,that are high in L-Tyrosine
such,"as aged Parmesan cheese,"
5403.153,"for instance, of all things."
5404.32,"Very, very high in L-Tyrosine."
5405.76,The precursor to dopamine.
5407.2,Certain foods.
5408.1,You can look up
online,which foods
5409.57,contain high levels
of,L-Tyrosine
5411.34,and which ones are compatible
with,your nutrition.
5413.59,But leaving pharmacology
"aside,",there's
5416.98,a very exciting
nonpharmacological,tool.
5420.49,A purely behavioral tool
that,the research literature
5424.0,has told us can selectively
increase,dopamine
5427.87,within the
nigrostriatal,pathway.
5430.75,The pathway that's involved
in,divergent thinking.
5433.12,And can do so very dramatically
as,much as 65% above baseline.
5437.98,And so this is a
behavioral,tool that
5440.56,is useful for a number of things
but,that I find particularly
5443.47,interesting in leveraging
towards,the exploration
5446.62,and enhancement of creativity
because,"first of all,"
5448.85,it's purely behavioral.
5449.86,So it's 0 cost.
5451.63,And it involves no manipulation
of,brain neuromodulators
5456.7,or chemistry through
pharmacology.,
5458.38,So it's something that you
can,explore very safely
5461.17,and certainly not having
to,purchase anything.
5463.21,And what's really remarkable
is,the selectivity
5466.57,or I think it's fair to
say,the immense selectivity
5469.42,that this particular
behavioral,intervention seems
5472.3,to exert on dopamine within
this,pathway associated
5475.9,with divergent thinking.
5477.1,So the study that
I'm,about to describe
5478.96,is a study that
dates,back 20 years.
5481.425,"Now, that should"
not,concern you.
5482.8,"In fact, the early arrival"
of,this study or what
5487.15,now seems to be early arrival.
5488.5,"I mean, it wasn't that long"
"ago,",is really exciting
5491.89,because the first
line,of this study
5493.78,really illustrates how important
or,how much of a landmark study
5497.86,this really is.
5498.53,And so I'll just read you
the,"first line of the study,"
5500.35,then I'll tell you
the,"title, then I'll"
5501.975,tell you what they discovered
in,fairly top contour
5504.965,and we will provide
a,link to the study
5506.59,if you want to peruse
it,in more detail.
5509.06,The first line of the study
is,"this is the first in vivo,"
5512.23,just meaning in the organism.
5513.73,"In this case, this"
was,a study on humans.
5516.05,This is the first in
vivo,demonstration
5518.17,of an association between an
endogenous,neurotransmitter
5521.68,"release, endogenous means within"
"us,",and conscious experience.
5525.677,So what this sentence
essentially,says
5527.26,is this is the first study
exploring,how a chemical that's
5529.84,naturally released in our body
relates,to a particular quality
5534.07,of conscious experience.
5536.02,This study was performed
in,"Scandinavia,"
5538.66,in one of the
hospitals,in Denmark.
5540.853,"Again, we'll provide a link."
5542.02,The first author is Kjaer.
5543.443,I think I'm pronouncing it
correctly,although probably not
5545.86,K-J-A-E-R et al.
5549.1,And the title of the
study,is Increased
5550.99,Dopamine Tone During
Meditation,Induced
5552.94,Change of Consciousness.
5554.152,And I want to just highlight
that,the meditation used
5556.36,in this study isn't really
a,meditation at all.
5558.65,I don't know why they
selected,that for the title.
5560.83,The behavioral protocol
used,in the study
5563.11,was more akin to what is
normally,called yoga nidra
5566.68,or NSDR nonsleep depressed.
5569.51,Now yoga nidra and NSDR have
been,discussed many times
5572.02,before on this podcast.
5573.52,"Yoga nidra, for"
"instance,",is a practice
5575.35,that's been around for hundreds
if,not thousands of years
5577.725,in which people
deliberately,lie still.
5580.15,So they're forcing themselves
to,"be mostly motionless,"
5583.42,small movements are fine.
5585.19,And they're directing
their,attention
5586.78,to the surface of
their,"body, they're"
5588.01,doing long exhale breathing.
5589.21,"Sometimes some intentions,"
sometimes,some visualization.
5592.51,But it's really
self-directed,relaxation.
5595.06,And the key component is that
people,stay awake and engage
5598.96,in very little movement.
5600.91,And the key word
there,is movement.
5602.74,"Now, nonsleep depressed is a"
"acronym,",a term that I coined.
5607.6,It's not a term that
I,coined in order
5609.64,to try and wipe away or
discard,with yoga nidra.
5612.76,I'm a person who has
great,respect for yoga
5615.7,nidra and its traditions.
5616.99,It's a term that
I,coined in order
5619.63,to encompass a number of
practices,that don't include
5622.66,any mystical type language
or,scientific language
5626.073,for that matter.
5626.74,And that doesn't
involve,intentions.
5628.6,It involves deep relaxation
yet,remaining wide awake
5632.29,and conscious.
5632.95,Sometimes people fall
asleep,and that's OK.
5634.87,But this is really an
atypical,brain state
5637.51,of being deeply relaxed yet in
general,awake and motionless.
5643.48,"Again, motionless being the key."
5645.55,Very few brain states involve us
being,mostly if not completely
5649.54,motionless and yet awake.
5650.66,And it turns out that
brain,state whether or not
5652.66,"you call it yoga nidra,"
you,"call it NSDR,"
5654.82,whether or not you call it
meditation,induced shift
5657.58,in consciousness as
they,"did in this study,"
5660.32,although they do
refer,"to yoga nidra,"
5662.23,"all refer to the same thing,"
which,is being motionless
5665.62,and yet aware and relaxed.
5668.71,I should mention.
5669.55,"So in this study,"
what,they did was
5671.14,they subjects into
the,laboratory.
5673.96,They had them either undergo
this,self-directed deep
5678.28,relaxation while they are
motionless,or mostly motionless
5681.7,or they had them listen
to,an audio script
5684.97,while also just lying
there,with eyes closed.
5687.28,And then they used a
number,of chemical tricks.
5689.448,And I don't want to
get,too deep into those
5691.24,now because they can be
a,little bit distracting.
5692.77,For those of you
that,"are interested,"
5693.86,you can look at it in the study.
5695.193,This is a binding of a
chemical,in the brain
5697.287,that then they can image
with,"brain imaging, which"
5699.37,is what they did in the study
to,evaluate how much dopamine
5703.06,changed in the brain
and,where specifically
5705.13,in the brain dopamine
changed,"its levels before,"
5708.44,"during, and after this"
particular,behavioral practice
5711.91,in one or the other group.
5713.2,And what they discovered
is,that people
5716.02,who did this deep
"relaxation,",that
5718.21,"is, self-directed deep"
relaxation,lying their eyes
5722.05,"closed, relatively motionless"
although,small movements
5727.24,of the body or movements of
the,head are absolutely fine.
5730.57,What they observed was a 65%
increase,in dopamine release.
5735.49,"Now, here its key."
5736.27,Dopamine release.
5738.07,And they observed an increase
in,so-called theta activity.
5741.49,Theta activity is a pattern
of,brain wave activity that's
5745.21,commonly associated
with,creative states
5747.85,and divergent thinking
in,particular.
5749.42,So that's important.
5751.25,And they observe
that,across subjects
5753.79,specifically in the
nigrostriatal,pathway.
5756.14,This pathway associated
with,divergent thinking.
5758.42,So this is very exciting.
5759.693,This is a study
that,really points
5761.11,to a behavioral tool that can
be,used to selectively elevate
5764.68,dopamine in the very pathway
that,one would want to if they
5768.52,wanted to engage divergent
thinking,for sake
5770.44,of creative exploration.
5772.18,There are also a number of key
observations,within this study.
5775.66,"First of all, the reduction in"
bodily,movement was essential.
5781.19,"In fact, when people rated or"
when,the amount of readiness
5786.46,"for action in their system,"
their,body was evaluated.
5790.33,What people found was that
immediately,after this practice
5793.36,they felt very still.
5795.04,"In other words, they felt as"
if,remaining still was natural.
5797.833,Now it's not the case
that,they couldn't move.
5799.75,"In fact, the"
elevation,in dopamine
5801.19,that occurred during
this,"practice, this yoga"
5804.88,nidra-like nonsleep or
NSDR-like,"practice, actually"
5808.96,prepared them to be able to
move,in a much more dedicated
5813.58,and robust way afterwards.
5814.845,"But during the practice,"
their,readiness for action
5816.97,"went way, way down."
5817.762,Not surprising.
5818.5,They were pretty
much,motionless.
5820.21,"But interestingly, as the"
level,of readiness for movement
5825.16,"went down, down,"
"down,","down down,"
5826.84,their degree of
visual,"imagery, that"
5829.51,"is, their internal"
landscape,and their ability
5832.39,to imagine new things increased.
5835.57,"And in fact, areas"
of,the brain that
5837.64,are associated
with,visual imagery
5839.14,such as the visual or
so-called,occipital
5841.72,cortex and the parietal cortex
has,been shown in other studies
5844.96,to ramp up when
people,are motionless.
5846.973,So there seems to be
this,inverse relationship
5848.89,between movement and visual
imagery,which makes sense.
5851.597,When we're moving
we,can pay attention
5853.18,to things in the
outside,"world, we"
5854.89,tend to be aware of our sensory
environment,to varying degrees.
5858.13,But we don't tend to be very
focused,on visual imagery
5860.8,within our head whereas when we
lie,down or sit down and close
5863.74,"our eyes and we are motionless,"
the,degree of visual imagery
5866.35,really increases.
5868.03,"Hence, the increase"
in,divergent thinking
5870.52,because what
essentially,is happening
5872.11,is the library of
"options,",the library
5875.29,of possible interactions
with,whatever it
5877.13,is that you're thinking about.
5878.38,"I gave the example, which"
is,a trivial one on purpose
5880.588,of a pen.
5881.23,But the bank of options
that,becomes available
5884.83,when we are motionless
and,when we are limiting
5886.96,our visualization of
the,external world
5890.2,increases exponentially.
5892.295,So this is important.
5893.17,And what it points
to,is the fact
5894.58,that this very simple completely
nonpharmacologic,behavioral
5898.03,practice of lying
down,motionless
5900.0,for some period of time.
5901.0,And I confess the amount
of,time that they use
5902.92,in the study was quite long.
5904.91,It was longer than 60 minutes.
5906.94,But all the data that I'm aware
of,in terms of NSDR and yoga
5910.87,"nidra, and there's a"
growing,body of literature
5912.85,on these practices
I,"should mention,"
5915.01,show that even 10
minutes,or even better
5918.79,would be 20 or 30 minutes
of,lying motionless
5921.49,with eyes closed and
allowing,"the mind to drift,"
5925.3,wherever it happens
to,"go, but focusing"
5929.14,on relaxing by doing
long,"exhale breathing,"
5931.69,perhaps doing a body
scan,or focusing
5933.61,your attention on
particular,body parts
5935.83,but not keeping it focused
on,any one particular body
5938.23,"part for that long, that general"
practice,of deep relaxation
5941.86,while awake and being
relatively,motionless really
5944.92,favors the brain
states,associated
5946.95,with divergent thinking.
5947.95,And actually
represents,an accessing
5950.62,of the various
components,that you would
5952.66,use during divergent thinking.
5954.88,And perhaps most
"excitingly,",it's
5957.4,associated with this massive
"increase,",65% increase
5960.79,in dopamine release within
the,very pathway that
5963.4,underlies divergent thinking.
5965.233,So my recommendation
would,be for those of you
5967.15,that are trying to
enhance,divergent thinking
5969.025,"and creative ability, that"
you,would do this practice
5972.41,at a minimum once per week.
5974.013,And I should say if you were
going,"to do it once per week,"
5976.43,I would recommend doing it
for,about 20 to 30 minutes.
5978.92,Some of you might be able to do
it,for as long as 60 minutes.
5981.89,I myself do such a practice
on,"a daily basis, anywhere"
5984.89,from 10 minutes to 20
"minutes,",sometimes 30 minutes.
5988.46,There's an example of an NSDR
"script,",completely zero cost.
5992.6,I confess it does
happen,to be my voice.
5994.61,So forgive me in advance.
5996.47,There are other options of NSDR.
5998.0,"You can go to YouTube,"
put,NSDR and my name.
6000.82,"Again, completely zero cost."
6002.14,You can get a sample of
what,a 10 minute NSDR
6005.32,script looks like.
6006.22,"That's through Virtusan,"
put,that out there.
6009.14,So thank you Virtusan for
putting,that out there
6011.14,at zero cost.
6012.25,There are examples of 20 and
30,minute NSDR scripts and yoga
6016.6,nidra scripts.
6017.35,Some that I particularly like.
6018.8,We will also provide a
link,to some of those.
6020.8,"Again, those are completely"
zero,cost for you to explore.
6023.62,But more important than you
follow,any one particular yoga
6026.8,nidra NSDR script
is,that you learn
6028.96,to take your body and brain into
these,"states of limited motion,"
6034.0,elevated dopamine within
this,"particular pathway,"
6036.61,and fairly deep relaxation.
6038.23,"Again, if you happen"
to,"fall asleep,"
6039.91,that's not necessarily
a,"bad thing,"
6041.913,although the idea
is,that you stay
6043.33,in a shallow plane
of,consciousness
6045.13,or sleep hence the term
nonsleep,deep rest.
6049.12,"So in any event, I think this"
is,a very useful practice
6051.67,that many people
could,benefit from.
6053.17,And the fact that it's zero
cost,"and purely behavioral,"
6055.462,I think adds additional
benefit,because it's
6058.355,certainly one that
people,could explore
6059.98,depending on what amount of
time,you're willing to commit.
6062.8,And the research
data,on this now
6065.29,extend beyond this
one,individual paper.
6067.42,And I think is really
exciting,because what it says
6070.06,is as the title and
first,line of the paper
6072.61,suggests is that we
can,increase dopamine
6074.74,using specific types
of,meditation induced
6077.47,consciousness.
6078.25,And those increases
in,dopamine can
6080.47,be used to increase our
ability,to be more creative.
6083.32,"Before moving forward, I"
want,to make absolutely clear
6086.23,how it is that you
would,use an NSDR a.k.a.
6089.32,"yoga nidra or similar,"
the,name doesn't really
6091.9,"matter after all, the"
practice,"is what matters,"
6094.66,in order to enhance dopamine
in,this nigrostriatal pathway
6099.16,and enhance divergent thinking.
6100.96,The key thing to
understand,here is
6103.12,that the period
of,motionlessness
6106.12,and deep relaxation
while,awake increases
6109.6,dopamine in the
nigrostriatal,pathway.
6111.97,It increases mental imagery.
6114.58,"That is, it increases access to"
the,"bank or the library, if you"
6119.29,"will, of possible"
solutions,or elements
6122.77,to engage in the divergent
thinking,process.
6125.35,But divergent thinking
itself,does not
6127.87,occur during NSDR a.k.a.
6130.66,yoga nidra.
6132.49,"The NSDR and yoga nidra, a"
deep,"relaxation meditation,"
6136.13,whatever it is you want to call
"it,",sets a dopaminergic tone.
6139.635,And that's actually the
appropriate,use of the word
6141.76,dopaminergic tone it
raises,the baseline
6144.1,of dopamine transmission
in,that circuitry that
6147.37,then positions you to
engage,in divergent thinking
6150.67,more effectively.
6151.82,So the idea would be to
do,"anywhere from 10 to 20,"
6154.9,"maybe 30 minutes, maybe"
even,"as much as an hour,"
6157.37,depending on how much time
you,had to dedicate of such
6159.91,a meditation and NSDR practice.
6162.13,And then not
necessarily,immediately
6164.77,but within the 5 to 15
minutes,"following, then"
6168.79,to go into a practice
of,divergent thinking
6171.58,and start doing
creative,exploration.
6173.5,That is to start thinking
about,different ways
6175.54,to combine existing
elements,in whatever domain
6178.0,it is that you want
to,achieve creativity.
6180.34,So the point is that the
divergent,thinking itself
6183.04,is not occurring during the
NSDR,or yoga nidra practice.
6187.48,The NSDR and yoga nidra
practice,prepares you
6189.94,for divergent thinking that
you,do in the hour or hours
6193.27,that follows.
6194.08,And just to contrast
that,"with pharmacology,"
6196.57,I am not aware of any specific
dopamine,related pharmacology
6200.86,that would allow us to
selectively,increase dopamine
6203.53,in the very pathway associated
with,divergent thinking
6205.99,and creativity.
6207.64,"Now, there are forms"
of,pharmacology
6209.71,that can shift brain
neurotransmitters,
6211.99,and modulators in ways
that,favor creativity.
6214.438,And this is certainly
a,topic that we
6215.98,we'll go into in more
depth,in a future episode.
6218.62,But there's an
exciting,study that
6220.12,was performed just
this,last year looking
6222.4,"at the role of serotonin,"
another,"neuromodulator,"
6225.91,in divergent and
convergent,thinking.
6228.16,And it turns out that serotonin
underlies,a lot of the brain
6233.02,activity that's responsible
for,both divergent
6235.66,and for convergent thinking.
6237.37,And there's one particular
form,of pharmacology
6240.52,which can enhance activation
of,the serotonergic pathways
6244.06,associated with the so-called
"5-HT,",that's serotonin.
6247.72,"5-HT, that's the abbreviation."
6249.88,5-HT2A receptor.
6252.88,Serotonin 2A receptor in
particular,brain areas
6255.91,in ways that favor both
divergent,and convergent
6258.46,thinking.
6259.03,And the pharmacologic
agent,in that case
6261.94,turns out to be very low
dose,or as some of you
6264.97,may have heard of it referred
to,as microdosing of psilocybin.
6269.383,"Now, I do want to say because it"
would,be entirely inappropriate
6272.05,"for me to not say this, that"
in,most areas of the world
6275.747,and particularly in
the,"United States,"
6277.33,psilocybin is still illegal.
6279.25,It is not legal.
6280.42,In some areas it has
been,decriminalized
6282.97,and there are a number of
different,clinical trials
6285.64,occurring now at Johns
"Hopkins,","at Stanford,"
6288.25,at University of
"California,","San Francisco,"
6290.26,and elsewhere
exploring,psilocybin
6292.15,for the treatment of
"depression,","for trauma,"
6294.88,for eating disorders.
6296.53,Most of those studies focus
on,macrodoses of psilocybin
6300.25,not microdosing.
6301.3,There are far fewer studies
of,microdosing of psilocybin.
6303.85,And I do have to point
out,that psilocybin use
6307.09,"and possession and, of"
"course,",sale is still illegal.
6310.34,So I would be remiss
if,I didn't state that.
6312.86,"However, I will provide"
a,link to the study that
6315.34,shows that microdosing
of,psilocybin
6317.62,for a series of weeks
on,a daily basis.
6320.54,So these are dosages
of,psilocybin
6322.06,that do not induce hallucination
and,do not massively
6325.93,shift mood or internal states in
any,way that has people feeling
6330.79,like they are acting
or,feeling that
6333.145,much different although
some,people do report
6335.02,a subjective shift.
6336.34,Does seem to increase
divergent,thinking ability.
6340.06,But I do want to put a
big,"asterisks, a highlight"
6343.72,in an underlying beneath the
statement,"I'm about to make,"
6347.12,which is that pharmacology
of,the serotonin system
6350.29,just as pharmacology
of,the dopamine system
6353.44,is very broadband.
6355.06,It's a shotgun approach.
6356.08,You're going to hit
all,the circuits
6357.58,of the brain that
involve,serotonin
6359.08,with microdosing psilocybin.
6360.91,Although it has some selectivity
for,the 5-HT2A receptor
6364.24,it can attach to other
receptors,as well and act there.
6368.39,This is the same reason why
"SSRI,",Selective Serotonin
6370.81,Reuptake Inhibitors can
indeed,shift mood and appetite
6374.26,but it can also shift
libido,and other things.
6376.72,It's because there are
serotonin,"receptors everywhere,"
6379.39,or I should say many
"places,",not just in
6381.982,the areas of the brain that
are,"associated with mood,"
6384.19,for instance.
6385.61,"And as I mentioned before,"
"agents,",whether or not they
6389.74,are recreational or illicit
drugs,or prescription drugs
6393.1,or supplements that
increase,dopamine will also
6396.61,be broadband into a number of
different,circuits in parallel.
6399.95,So this is why I always
say,behavioral tools really
6404.02,should come first.
6405.22,I don't say that because
I,"dislike pharmacology,"
6407.555,I say that because in many
cases,behavioral tools are not
6409.93,only safer and easier
to,titrate to adjust
6412.45,"the duration, et cetera"
than,"is pharmacology,"
6415.33,but also because
they,can sometimes
6417.412,as in the case of
the,study we just
6418.87,described for you more
specificity,not less than
6422.77,pharmacology.
6423.53,Pharmacology has its
place,"can be wonderful,"
6426.52,provided safe and
"legal,",et cetera.
6428.44,But it can cause a lot of
so-called,off target effects.
6431.842,So for those of you that
are,interested in increasing
6434.05,creativity through
"pharmacology,",I
6436.72,"would say, stay tuned for"
the,data on psilocybin
6440.62,and microdosing psilocybin.
6441.88,If you are absolutely obsessed
with,the idea of microdosing
6445.93,psilocybin for
enhancing,creativity
6447.708,and you'd like to go
straight,"to the study,"
6449.5,I will tell you what that
study,is and therefore you
6452.02,can access some of the
specifics,in terms of dosages
6454.45,"and protocols, et cetera."
6455.56,So since I can't
help,"myself, I'll"
6456.977,just very briefly summarize that
microdosing,psychedelic study.
6461.18,"The title of the study,"
which,was published in 2018
6464.38,is Exploring the Effect of
Microdosing,Psychedelics
6466.6,on Creativity in an Open
Label,Natural Setting.
6470.26,Interesting title.
6471.22,This was a microdosing
event,organized
6473.53,by the Dutch
psychedelic,society.
6475.6,They examined the effects
of,psychedelic truffles
6478.24,where they knew what psychedelic
compounds,were contained there
6482.65,on two creativity related
problem,"solving task,"
6486.13,"the picture concept task, which"
I,don't expect you to recognize
6489.46,or know but it assesses
convergent,thinking
6491.83,and the alternative
uses,task which
6494.447,I also don't expect
you,to know but is
6496.03,a standard task for
assessing,divergent thinking.
6498.67,They tested once before
taking,a microdose
6501.07,and while the effects were
expected,to be manifested
6503.92,they say.
6504.79,Interesting.
6505.3,They use the word manifested
in,a study of psychedelics.
6507.633,Science is changing indeed.
6510.25,"In any case, what they found"
was,an enhancement of creative.
6516.13,"That is, divergent and"
convergent,thinking
6519.25,not surprising given the
fact,that the 5-HT2A receptor
6524.05,activity is increased by
microdosing,of psilocybin
6528.46,and 5-HT2A receptors are present
both,on the neural circuits
6532.45,that underlie divergent
and,convergent thinking.
6535.54,"So, again, this is not a plug"
for,microdosing psilocybin.
6540.34,This is really in
response,to what
6542.315,I know will be a number of
different,questions about what
6544.69,pharmacologic agents can be
used,to increase creativity.
6548.02,So more on that later
"and,","again, we'll"
6549.91,provide a link if you want to
read,that study in more depth.
6553.84,I can imagine that
a,number of you
6555.31,are probably also wondering
about,the effects of alcohol
6557.94,and the effects of
cannabis,on creativity.
6559.69,We did a long in-depth
episode,all about alcohol
6562.87,and its effects on health.
6564.85,The bottom line on
alcohol,is that in excess
6568.055,of two drinks per
"week,",you're starting
6569.68,to run into the cancer promoting
and,toxic effects of alcohol.
6573.55,I didn't choose for
the,"answer to be that,"
6576.62,but that's what
the,data tell us.
6579.46,I'm not telling you you can't
drink,more than two drinks
6581.83,"per week, I'm just saying that"
if,"you're going to do that,"
6583.58,you should really
consider,offsetting
6585.64,that with some other
behavioral,measures
6587.62,all discussed in the
episode,on alcohol.
6589.39,And despite what
people,"think, there"
6592.12,is absolutely zero evidence that
alcohol,increases creativity.
6597.31,"However, by way of"
reducing,activation
6600.55,"of the prefrontal cortex,"
there,is some evidence
6603.28,that alcohol and
other,substances
6605.26,that reduce what's called
autobiographical,"scripting,"
6608.65,"that is, a narrative"
about,"ourselves,"
6612.5,"so self awareness, that it"
can,enhance divergent thinking
6615.97,at very low doses.
6617.435,And this makes sense.
6618.31,Divergent thinking involves
remembering,certain things
6621.43,that we can use as elements
in,the creative process
6623.77,but suppressing narratives
about,what the use of those
6626.89,would mean.
6627.46,Will people like it?
6628.36,Will they not like it?
6629.41,Will it to the outcome we want?
6630.55,"Well, it won't."
6631.18,All of that
autobiographical,scripting
6633.01,involves the forebrain
being,"very, very active"
6636.16,and specific regions of the
forebrain,in particular.
6638.86,And that all needs
to,"be suppressed,"
6641.56,which alcohol in very
low,doses can accomplish.
6644.37,"But, again, that's not"
a,plug for alcohol.
6646.12,I think behavioral tools
would,be a much better route.
6648.49,But therefore it
shouldn't,be surprising
6651.16,why some people have used
low,dose alcohol in order
6653.74,to engage in the
creative,process
6655.54,because it involves
less,inhibition
6657.19,or sense of self that could be
detrimental,to the divergent
6659.89,thinking process.
6660.91,"Now, with respect to"
"cannabis,",I went in depth
6664.12,into the biology and the
various,"uses, misuses,"
6667.54,"dangers, and in some cases"
benefits,of cannabis use
6670.72,in certain.
6672.1,The key word there is
certain,populations.
6674.63,And I also dove
into,whether or not
6677.62,cannabis can be used to increase
divergent,and convergent
6680.3,thinking.
6680.8,So that's timestamped
in,that episode.
6682.27,I'll refer you to that episode.
6683.562,But the long and short of
it,is that many of the ideas
6686.89,that people come up with when
under,the influence of cannabis
6690.16,in particular high THC
containing,cannabis does lead
6695.53,to enhanced divergent
"thinking,",but so enhanced
6699.22,it turns out that
oftentimes,those ideas can't
6701.8,be constrained by the
convergent,thinking process.
6704.27,"In other words, they"
have,lots of ideas
6705.91,that make sense while under
the,influence of cannabis.
6709.57,But that later cannot be
implemented,into a coherent
6713.83,framework that leads to any
actual,creative endeavor
6718.3,or creative product.
6719.92,"Or, as is often the"
case,"with cannabis,"
6722.17,they simply can't remember
what,they were thinking about.
6724.78,Any time there's a
discussion,"about dopamine,"
6727.03,there seems to be a discussion
about,"motivation, desire,"
6729.91,and drive.
6730.54,"And, of course, that makes sense"
given,the roles of dopamine.
6733.09,We did an entire episode
on,"dopamine, motivation,"
6735.18,and drive.
6735.68,It's one of our most
popular,episodes.
6737.47,"Again, you can access that"
with,timestamps and all formats
6740.44,at hubermanlab.com.
6742.15,And any time
there's,a discussion
6743.59,about dopamine and
"motivation,",we also
6746.95,seem to have a lot of questions
about,attention and focus
6750.22,and ADHD or attention
deficit,hyperactivity
6752.98,disorder in particular.
6754.58,So just as a brief
"mention,",there
6756.52,is a literature although
not,"terribly extensive,"
6759.4,a small but strong literature
on,the relationship
6762.58,between ADHD and creativity.
6764.89,And the long and short
of,that literature
6766.63,is that people who have
ADHD,regardless of age
6770.5,do seem to have an
ability,to focus.
6773.11,I've mentioned that
in,the episode on ADHD
6775.09,provided that they are
interested,in the thing
6777.79,that they are focusing on.
6779.09,So that runs counter to this
idea,that people with ADHD
6781.57,simply can't focus.
6782.53,They can but it tends to be a
focus,that selective for things
6785.62,that they are very excited about
or,interested in as opposed
6788.47,to a general ability to focus.
6790.93,What's also highly
underappreciated,
6793.75,is that people who
have,ADHD oftentimes
6797.26,are very effective
at,divergent thinking
6799.9,but are less effective
at,convergent thinking.
6802.72,What this tells us is
that,people with ADHD
6805.0,can often have excellent novel
and,"indeed creative ideas,"
6809.5,but that the implementation
of,those creative ideas
6812.32,is sometimes challenge.
6813.43,And that's one reason to
explore,"rational pharmacology,"
6816.22,"nutrition,"
"supplementation,",et cetera.
6818.05,Those are all things
to,explore in concert
6820.15,with or I should say in
working,closely with a board
6823.33,certified physician or ideally
psychiatrist,expert in ADHD.
6826.948,You can also check out the
episode,that we did on ADHD.
6829.24,There are a lot of tools there.
6830.532,A lot of science mentioned
there,to support those tools.
6833.2,"Again, you can find"
that,Hubermanlab.com.
6835.15,But I did think it was
important,"to point out,"
6837.35,even if briefly that having ADHD
is,not a barrier to creativity
6841.99,"and, in fact, may actually be"
an,enhanced portal to creativity
6845.71,but that it doesn't
allow,people to access
6848.44,the convergent thinking that
allows,creative ideas to be
6852.1,implemented into specific
"strategies,","pressure tested,"
6854.95,and eventually delivered in
the,form of a final product
6857.92,"of music, art, et cetera."
6859.63,That is not to say that people
with,ADHD cannot accomplish
6862.69,"that, but that it is going to"
require,some additional steps
6865.63,and protocols in order to
enhance,convergent thinking.
6868.81,And that episode and
the,episode that we
6870.49,did on focus and in particular
tools,to enhance focus
6874.3,is very much directed at ways
to,enhance convergent thinking.
6878.26,So if you have ADHD or
know,somebody who does
6880.45,and you're interested
in,"the creative process,"
6882.367,we're focusing generally
please,check out the episodes
6884.77,that I mentioned.
6885.58,"Now, there's also a small"
but,nonetheless very exciting
6887.98,literature on the relationship
between,physical movement
6890.74,and divergent thinking.
6892.13,This should come as
no,surprise to us.
6894.28,As mentioned many times
now,"in this episode,"
6896.53,the nigrostriatal pathway
involved,in divergent thinking
6899.17,that involves dopamine is also
responsible,for eye blinks
6902.56,and for movements of the
limbs,of the body in very
6905.92,deliberate ways.
6907.36,This tells us that there's
some,direct or maybe
6910.75,indirect relationship
between,movement
6912.67,of the body and
divergent,thinking.
6915.207,And despite the fact that
it's,"only a few studies,"
6917.29,there have been some studies
of,whether or not people are
6919.9,able to engage in
divergent,thinking
6921.7,more effectively when
they,are doing things
6923.86,like pacing or walking.
6926.277,And this could be on a
treadmill,or back and forth
6928.36,across the room.
6929.17,"And in fact, that is"
absolutely,the case.
6931.36,If you're somebody
like,myself who
6933.25,tends to have their
best,"ideas, not"
6936.55,saying that my ideas are always
"terrific,",but among the ideas
6939.58,"I have, some of the better"
ones,arrive to me while
6942.28,on my long Sunday run.
6944.08,I tend to do a long
run,or hike on Sundays
6946.63,sometimes with a light weight
vest,or something of that sort.
6949.58,But when I'm in a state
of,essentially not
6952.3,directing my attention
to,any one thing
6954.73,"in my external environment, this"
is,extremely key for reasons
6957.475,that now should be obvious.
6958.6,Any time we are
directing,our attention
6960.225,to a visual target
or,an auditory target
6962.77,we are not as able to engage
in,divergent thinking.
6965.38,This is why I will
sometimes,listen
6967.42,to podcasts or to audiobooks
while,I go on these runs.
6970.09,But for portions of
these,runs or hikes
6971.74,I tend to turn those off and
just,focus on the movement
6975.07,and focus on not focusing
on,anything in particular.
6977.65,And oftentimes I will stop and
write,down ideas that suddenly
6981.19,or seemingly suddenly appear
to,me or geyser to the surface.
6985.12,I'll have an idea.
6985.87,"Sometimes those are good ideas,"
sometimes,less good ideas.
6988.3,The fact that happens
for,me and the fact
6990.37,that many people are
pacers,or runners
6993.04,or come up with their best
ideas,while in the shower
6995.35,or while engaging in
activities,that don't require
6998.02,a lot of sensory
attention,to one
6999.88,specific location either
visual,"or auditory,"
7002.58,"et cetera, that is because it"
engages,these nigrostriatal
7007.29,pathways through movement
which,then opens up
7010.53,this library of ideas and
allows,the intersection
7013.38,of different ideas that
normally,would be constrained
7015.9,to separate categories.
7017.46,One way to think
about,this by analogy
7019.53,would be when I was a kid
you'd,"go to the library,"
7022.62,nowadays you just go online.
7023.79,But the different pages
of,different books
7025.74,on different topics are kept
distinct,from one another.
7028.89,That is bound by different
book,covers and book
7031.68,"ends, different"
shelves,in the library.
7034.807,It's as if different pages
and,elements from those books
7037.14,are now being combined
in,a pseudo random.
7039.96,Not random but in a
pseudo,random way.
7042.48,"And in that combination,"
new,possibilities
7045.48,about ways that information
could,be combined
7047.58,and implemented start to arise.
7050.05,So the tool that emerges
from,this is very simple.
7052.32,And it won't necessarily
apply,to everybody.
7054.79,But if you are
somebody,who finds
7056.31,that just sitting in a chair
and,trying to be creative
7058.56,"is very challenging, some"
of,"you might benefit from,"
7061.025,"for instance, if"
you,are engaging
7062.4,in writing or you want to
write,to talk into the voice
7066.42,recorder of your phone while
walking,or simply walking
7069.06,and not attending to any
one,specific thing visually
7071.91,or through headphones.
7072.87,And then as ideas
"surface,",seemingly
7076.71,"out of nowhere, which"
is,"how it happens,"
7078.483,that you could either
put,them into your phone
7080.4,by voice dictation or you could
type,them out if you like.
7082.817,The key thing is to
not,be distracted
7084.42,by other things
in,"your phone, not"
7085.842,to start going onto social
media,or doing phone calls
7088.05,or looking at text messages
because,that by definition
7090.72,is going to take you out
of,this what biologists
7093.99,call a pseudo random walk.
7095.91,And this pseudo random element
is,extremely important.
7099.94,"We know, for instance, that"
many,circuits within the brain
7102.69,have what's called dedicated
point,to point wiring.
7105.21,"So, for instance,"
the,brain circuits
7106.815,that govern your breathing.
7107.94,The brain circuits that
govern,your heartbeat.
7109.857,The brain circuits that
govern,your specific movements
7112.42,once you are an adult and allow
for,smooth directed movement
7115.59,"are very precise, very little"
slop,if any in the wiring.
7119.55,"However, there are aspects of"
your,"brain circuitry, yours"
7123.75,and everybody
else's,"I should say,"
7126.73,that are maintained
into,adulthood that
7129.18,include a lot of extra wiring.
7132.09,And these are fine wires.
7133.59,They are not the major highways
between,"different areas,"
7135.97,if you will.
7136.54,So like Google Maps has highways
and,streets and little passages
7141.09,and alleys.
7141.75,But it's as if
there's,a little web
7143.7,of additional possible pathways
cast,over that entire thing.
7147.54,The human brain maintains
such,webs of possible passage.
7151.71,And it's only during activities
such,"as walking, running,"
7156.25,"cycling, swimming,"
"hiking,","pacing, et"
7160.76,cetera that the activation of
those,pseudo random pathways
7164.76,starts to ramp up.
7166.24,So this is a purely
behavioral,approach
7168.99,to engaging different elements
within,neural networks that
7172.35,normally would not
communicate,with one another
7174.39,when we are completely still.
7175.83,"So again, the"
practices,that I talked
7177.64,about earlier of being
completely,still to raise
7179.64,dopamine and enhanced
divergent,thinking--
7182.49,I just want to
reemphasize,are designed
7185.76,to position you to
ready,you to engage
7188.82,in the activities like
walking,"and pacing,"
7191.22,"et cetera, that best"
facilitate,divergent thinking.
7194.7,So if you are somebody who wants
to,"enhance divergent thinking,"
7197.61,I would encourage
you,to explore how
7199.5,different patterns of movement
in,"particular, patterns"
7201.75,of movement that don't require
any,conscious attention
7204.18,to any one specific thing
allow,you to access new ideas
7208.65,and new ways of combining
existing,elements
7210.96,in whatever domain it is
you,want to be creative.
7213.45,"Now, this is also an opportunity"
to,underscore something
7215.982,I said back at the
"beginning,",which
7217.44,is you are not going to come
up,with great works of music
7220.08,if you don't understand
chords,and melodies and notes
7224.07,and music.
7224.97,Those basic elements
have,to be built up
7226.89,through some formal or at least
rigorous,or regular training.
7230.152,In the same way that you're
not,"going to take a walk,"
7232.36,and then suddenly
be,able to paint
7233.94,an incredible picture if you
have,no painting ability.
7236.19,That is not going to happen.
7237.78,What I'm talking
about,here are ways
7239.28,to enhance your capacity
for,"divergent thinking,"
7241.6,such as NSDR and ways to
engage,"in divergent thinking,"
7245.68,such as through certain forms
of,movement that don't require
7248.76,a lot of conscious attention
to,your surroundings or any one
7251.34,specific sensory target.
7254.1,"And in doing so,"
enhancing,your ability
7256.98,to be more creative in a
domain,for which you already
7259.86,have some degree of
skill,or even mastery.
7262.65,"Now, in keeping with"
the,theme of how
7264.24,to enhance our
"creativity,",there's
7266.52,a very exciting and yet parallel
literature,to the literature
7271.11,that I've been
describing,thus far.
7272.688,"Now, I promise you"
that,I'm not going
7274.23,to open up an entire
library,of new information
7277.74,related to neural
circuits,and so forth.
7279.7,But I would be remiss
if,I didn't mention
7281.91,this parallel literature because
it,speaks very specifically
7285.03,to some important practices
that,we can all use in order
7288.63,to enhance creativity.
7289.74,And to do so the first
time,and every time.
7292.71,And this is really because
certain,scientists out there
7295.25,have really gone
through,the trouble.
7297.14,I should even say the
painstaking,trouble
7299.18,of really trying to dissect
what,the creative process is
7302.0,both for individuals and
in,groups or even in pairs.
7306.5,And so what I'm about to tell
you,is beautifully encapsulated
7309.59,in an article entitled--
7311.81,"""A new method for"
training,creativity--
7314.03,narrative as an alternative
to,"divergent thinking."""
7317.12,"So again, we've been talking"
about,divergent thinking.
7319.37,That's one pathway into
the,creative process
7321.83,but there are others as well.
7323.4,And as it turns
"out,",they're not so
7325.28,distinct in terms of the
underlying,brain mechanisms.
7327.71,"Nonetheless, let"
me,describe briefly
7329.54,how narrative can be
used,to train creativity
7332.36,and to become more creative.
7333.98,And in order to
do,"that, I'd like"
7335.54,to just briefly
paraphrase,or read
7337.22,from the first
paragraph,of this paper.
7339.09,So what I'm about to read are
the,"author's words, not mine."
7342.17,"Quote ""Here's a paradox."
7344.63,According to current
research,young children
7346.88,are more imaginatively
creative,"than adults."""
7349.46,And indeed that is
"true,",by the way.
7351.59,"""Yet also according"
to,"current research,"
7354.05,creativity is main neural
engine,"is divergent thinking,"
7357.56,which relies on memory
and,logical association
7360.8,to tasks at which young
children,"underperform adults."""
7364.55,"That is, children are not as"
good,at divergent thinking
7368.09,as adults are.
7368.84,So how could it
be,the authors are
7370.67,asking that children are
more,imaginative and thus
7374.15,more creative than adults.
7375.83,This can only mean that
there,are alternate pathways
7379.34,to creativity.
7380.93,And indeed that is the case.
7382.68,And so what this
paper,really explores
7385.34,is other ways to
access,creativity.
7387.65,And what they describe is
what's,called narrative theory.
7390.71,And there's a number
of,different aspects
7392.48,to this narrative theory.
7394.64,But they agree that the standard
definition,of creativity
7398.24,is the same one that we
were,talking about before.
7400.53,So we're not talking about a
different,"form of creativity,"
7402.5,here we're talking
about,a different way
7404.167,to access creativity.
7405.2,They describe the standard
definition,of creativity
7407.63,"as quote ""The"
ability,to generate
7409.28,"novel ideas that are useful."""
7411.18,So the commonly accepted one.
7412.82,And what they cite as the
basis,for narrative theory
7416.87,is this breakthrough
finding,in the 1950s.
7419.107,This is the work of Guilford
Some,people out there
7421.19,might be familiar with it.
7422.273,I was not at the outset of
researching,this episode.
7424.91,What this theory from
Guilford,essentially states
7427.497,is that there are different
intellectual,capacities that
7429.83,are not captured by
standard,IQ tests.
7431.548,I think that's generally
accepted,nowadays.
7433.34,We know there's
emotional,"intelligence,"
7435.26,we know the standard
"IQ,",et cetera.
7437.63,But the important
element,to understand
7440.21,is that these authors
were,able to trace back
7443.9,the idea of narrative
training,as a way
7447.02,to enhance creativity long
before,"Guilford in the 1950s,"
7451.14,all the way back to Aristotle.
7453.273,So this is incredible.
7454.19,Narrative theory
was,actually birthed
7455.9,in 335 BCE in his
writing,"called Poetics,"
7460.55,which I think is
incredible,at least to me
7464.1,that people long before us
were,thinking about creativity
7467.33,and what goes into creativity.
7468.98,"And what Aristotle said, what"
Guilford,then elaborated on
7472.31,and what the authors
of,this paper
7474.86,further elaborate
on,and actually have
7476.93,developed training
protocols,"for,"
7478.67,is the idea that there are
three,elements that we can use
7481.43,in order to enhance creativity.
7482.9,And those three
elements,are what's
7485.36,called world
"building,",I'll explain
7487.52,"what these are in a moment,"
perspective,"shifting,"
7490.34,and action generating.
7492.17,And right off the
"bat,",the word action
7494.96,should raise a flag for you.
7496.83,And by that I mean a positive
flag,"because once again,"
7499.46,we are back into the world and
therefore,the neural circuits
7502.43,of movement and motion.
7504.77,So three elements of world
building,"perspective, shifting,"
7508.34,and active generating are
what,make up this narrative
7510.95,approach to creativity.
7512.24,And I should mention that
these,authors and others are
7514.64,using such approach with
"companies,","with groups,"
7517.19,with individuals.
7518.003,So this is using a bunch
of,different contexts
7519.92,to approach and enhance
different,forms of creativity.
7523.79,So let's talk first about
world,building techniques.
7527.19,This is going to be
immediately,familiar to you
7530.72,when you hear it.
7531.63,But one of the key elements of
creativity,is to at the outset
7536.6,come up with some idea
that,makes sense or is
7539.9,attractive to you about how
the,world is different inside
7543.47,of your creative endeavor.
7544.92,So for those that
write,science fiction
7547.328,or think about
science,"fiction, there"
7548.87,are some obvious
aspects,to this.
7550.82,But for those of you
that,"don't, maybe you"
7552.71,come up with a
"narrative,","for instance,"
7554.34,in the context of storytelling
that,in your world
7557.33,we are the house
cats,and the cats
7561.045,are actually the ones that
are,the curators of the Earth.
7563.42,OK.
7563.92,"So right there, there"
is,a conceptual shift
7566.81,that the world in which
whatever,creative idea is going
7570.02,to emerge is entirely
different,than the one
7572.15,that we actually live in.
7573.32,So that sets a certain number
of,important constraints.
7575.782,It means certain things
are,"now possible,"
7577.49,other things are
not,possible that
7578.907,are very different from
the,world that we live in.
7581.21,You can see the parallels here
to,childhood imagination where
7585.025,essentially anything can
happen,in the child's mind
7587.15,because they are unconstrained.
7588.56,The second element
is,this perspective
7590.27,shifting techniques.
7591.53,And the idea here is
that,not only are we
7595.21,supposed to have the reader or
the,listener or the observer
7598.99,or us explore for creativity
and,develop a creative idea
7603.46,by thinking differently
which,is a generic term.
7606.968,How do we actually
think,differently.
7608.51,But rather than just say take
the,perspective of somebody
7612.34,else in terms of what
they,would see or do
7614.5,or say or think
"rather,",we are supposed
7617.35,to think about their
underlying,motivation.
7619.42,"So we could do the world shift,"
that,is the world structure
7622.84,shift from step one.
7623.95,"And then in step two, you"
would,"ask yourself OK,"
7627.19,rather than write about
or,think about or move
7630.37,from the perspective
of,"myself, let's say,"
7632.62,you're feeling particularly
happy,that day.
7634.81,"You'd say, I'm actually"
going,to take the perspective
7637.18,of somebody who's angry.
7638.44,But rather than
just,"act angry, I'm"
7640.717,going to think about what their
motivation,for being angry is.
7643.3,Maybe they had a breakup.
7645.13,Maybe they were jealous.
7646.21,Maybe somebody had
wronged,them in some way.
7648.24,Maybe they're just generally
angry,at the world for whatever
7650.74,reason and then operate from
that,motivational stance.
7653.77,And this is a very
interesting,and powerful step
7656.89,because what it really
captures,at least
7659.02,"as viewed by me,"
the,"neuroscientists,"
7661.06,is it captures a whole set
of,neural circuits about what
7663.58,that motivational state means
because,motivational states
7666.61,dictate a huge number of
possible,"different outcomes,"
7669.92,but they really constrain the
number,of different actions
7673.01,and outcomes that any
of,us would engage in.
7674.89,Rather than saying I'm going
to,view the world the way
7677.14,that someone else
will,"view the world,"
7678.723,by stating that we are
going,to be motivated
7680.68,by their set of motivations
and,"not our own,"
7683.17,it includes a lot more
possibilities,and yet not
7686.26,an infinite number
of,possibilities.
7687.88,They are constrained
in,"a logical way,"
7689.78,which is one of the key
elements,of creativity.
7692.265,And then the third
"element,",which
7693.64,is action generating techniques
is,a really cool one that you
7698.53,will immediately
notice,implications
7700.03,"for the workplace, which"
is,forced collaboration.
7703.39,So inside of this thing
that,"we're building here,"
7705.82,"this story, you create a"
novel,rule for the world
7710.35,that your story is
going,to exist in
7712.06,or your music is going to exist
in,or your sport will exist in.
7716.05,Then you create this
perspective,shift
7718.54,where you take on the
motivation,of someone
7721.27,else different than
you,and then you
7723.64,force collaboration
between,that person who
7726.22,has this alternate
motivation,different from you
7729.28,and someone else who has an
entirely,different motivation.
7731.74,"And in doing so,"
you,create these
7733.57,what are called the
creative,collisions.
7735.642,Now they're collisions because
they're,crossing one another
7738.1,and something new has
to,emerge from them.
7739.85,They could be antagonistic.
7741.59,They could be arguments
fighting,physical or verbal
7743.86,or Otherwise they
could,be synergistic.
7746.0,They could take on any
number,of different forms
7748.0,depending on the motivations
and,the individuals that
7750.49,are involved.
7751.46,But even though I
just,described this
7753.49,"in fairly top contour,"
what,I just described
7756.22,is actually the core
elements,of any story
7759.76,or any creative endeavor.
7760.89,It's just that many stories are
from,the perspective of what
7763.39,we already know and believe
and,think the world to be.
7767.53,And our own perspective
and,the actions
7771.34,that we would take given that
world,in that perspective.
7774.13,Whereas if we want
to,"be creative,"
7776.33,we want to think outside
of,our usual framework
7778.75,and yet using elements
that,exist within us
7781.24,no one has to tell us
the,creative narrative.
7783.22,We're trying to come
up,with it on our own.
7785.12,We want to essentially
think,in a childlike way
7787.93,how do children think?
7789.16,"Well, they have new"
different,or entirely novel
7793.57,concepts about how
the,world works.
7795.37,But those are bounded.
7797.202,And this is a key word.
7798.16,Those are bounded.
7798.91,They're not infinite.
7799.785,It's not that
anything,can happen.
7801.94,"Some kids will say, you can fly"
and,you can shoot lasers out
7804.482,"of your eyes, you"
can,do all things
7805.94,that are unicorns or candy
falling,from the sky.
7808.15,"At some point, if you don't"
bound,"the change in the world,"
7812.6,it just becomes pure chaos and
even,children don't do that.
7815.18,So we need to bound the
change,and yet create
7817.45,"some alternate universe, if you"
"will,",in which the story takes
7821.26,place or the
creation,"of any kind,"
7823.625,doesn't have to be
a,story takes place.
7825.25,Then there has to be
a,perspective shift.
7826.81,And this is very useful.
7827.81,This is actually a
tool,that we can all
7830.05,use of trying to take
the,perspective of others
7832.27,but not just asking what they
would,feel or think or do.
7835.99,But ask what is their
motivation,in life generally
7839.74,or what mood stance or goal
stance,are they taking.
7843.17,Are they trying to
extract,from others?
7844.84,Are they trying
to,give to others?
7846.28,"Are they very altruistic,"
et,"cetera, et cetera."
7848.47,And then you take
that,individual
7850.3,and you do that also for
another,individual or group
7853.125,of individuals
and,then you start
7854.5,thinking about how those
different,individuals because
7857.597,of their different
motivational,states
7859.18,would engage at the
level,of action.
7860.873,"What they would do,"
what,"they would say,"
7862.54,"would they mate,"
would,"they fight,"
7863.957,would they-- et
"cetera,",et cetera.
7865.6,You think of any story.
7866.77,"The story of Star Wars,"
of,the Greek myths.
7869.74,You think of any story that has
been,"created, which we consider"
7874.21,great and novel works.
7876.19,And you start to find these
three,"elements-- worldbuilding,"
7880.27,"perspective shifting, and"
action,generating techniques.
7883.36,"And so while this is, again,"
just,a broad contour of what
7887.59,this narrative
approach,"involves,"
7889.24,I think it's a very
important,and very exciting
7891.43,one because it
gives,us a formula.
7893.425,We already know that
divergent,thinking
7895.05,and convergent thinking
are,both elements
7896.758,of the creative process.
7898.44,This is suggesting
that,whether or not
7901.17,it involves divergent
thinking,"or not,"
7903.072,these authors seem
to,think this is
7904.53,distinct from divergent
thinking,that capturing some
7906.96,of the elements of creativity
that,are present in childhood
7909.96,but that then tend to
disappear,as we start
7911.91,"to assume identity, build"
"identity,",and understand rules
7914.82,about the actual
world,we live in.
7916.56,All of those basic elements
of,early childhood creativity
7920.34,can be reawakened.
7921.343,"And, in fact, they have data"
to,support the fact that they
7923.76,can be reawakened in
adults,in meaningful ways
7926.19,that can lead to new product
"design,",new workplace
7928.62,"interactions, and on and on."
7930.6,That I find very exciting.
7932.68,"And as a consequence,"
I,do intend
7935.73,to do an entire episode
at,some point on narrative
7938.61,and storytelling.
7939.48,And the role of narrative
and,storytelling
7941.34,not just for sake of
creativity,but also
7943.23,for accessing neuroplasticity
and,for enhancing memory
7947.46,and so on.
7948.01,There's an entire landscape of
literature,and exciting tools
7950.55,and things to understand there.
7951.85,"But in the meantime, we will"
provide,a link to this paper.
7954.87,And for those of you that
choose,"not to access the paper,"
7957.45,simply understanding these
three,aspects of narrative
7960.96,as an alternative to
accessing,creativity.
7963.18,"That is, a dedicated and well"
understood,or established
7967.77,"world shift that you choose,"
perspective,shifting and taking
7971.07,on the motivation of
"others,",and creating
7974.37,some landscape of exploration
for,what interactions would
7977.49,occur between that individual
or,groups of individuals
7979.74,and other individuals that
have,other motivations
7982.65,and yet are still living
in,this alternate world.
7985.86,Those three elements
we,now know can
7988.29,be combined into what
you,or I or anyone
7991.53,would consider important
creative,works.
7993.97,So today we
discussed,creativity.
7996.27,This absolutely fascinating
aspect,to human brain
7999.63,function that has allowed us as
a,species to develop everything
8003.83,from great works
of,art and music
8005.87,to technological innovations
that,allow us to fly and allow
8009.59,us to access people all over
the,world through little screen
8012.23,devices that we carry around
in,our pockets and on and on.
8016.615,As I mentioned at the
beginning,"of today's episode,"
8018.74,I find creativity to be one of
the,most fascinating aspects
8022.55,of brain function.
8023.96,"And in particular,"
because,we don't actually
8026.81,know what the upper
limits,of creativity
8028.58,are and yet we understand
that,"there are certain bounds,"
8032.778,there are certain requirements.
8034.07,And the key requirement
for,creativity
8036.11,is this aspect of utility.
8037.7,"Now, that doesn't"
necessarily,mean
8039.2,that for something to
be,considered creative
8041.37,it has to be useful in
the,"practical sense,"
8044.18,but it does seem
that,for something
8046.13,to be considered truly
creative,or especially creative
8050.0,in some cases that
it,revealed to us
8052.19,something fundamental about the
way,that we or the world works.
8056.338,We discuss some of the
neural,circuits that
8058.13,underlie the different
aspects,of creativity
8060.14,in particular divergent
and,convergent thinking
8062.18,as well as narrative building
and,some of the tools
8064.97,and steps that can allow
us,to better access
8067.88,divergent thinking and
convergent,thinking.
8070.31,And those tools include
behavioral,tools as well as
8073.13,pharmacology.
8074.33,And we talked about narrative
building,as a way to reawaken
8078.47,"or I should say, reaccess"
the,childhood creativity
8081.83,that did indeed exist in all
of,us at some point in time.
