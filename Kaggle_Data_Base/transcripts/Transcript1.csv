0.179,welcome to the huberman Lab podcast
1.92,where we discuss science and
3.959,science-based tools for everyday life
8.88,I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor
10.92,of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
13.38,Stanford school of medicine today we are
15.719,discussing headaches headaches are
17.88,something that everybody will suffer at
20.039,some point in their lifetime of course
21.96,some people suffer from headaches far
23.52,more often than others and for many
25.56,people headaches can be incredibly
27.3,debilitating limiting their ability to
29.76,work to socialize to sleep to exercise
32.42,essentially to live life in any kind of
35.64,normal way as we'll soon discuss there
38.46,are many different kinds of headache we
40.379,have migraine headaches tension
41.64,headaches cluster headaches today I will
43.44,review all the different types of
44.94,headaches and what the underlying
47.52,biology of each and every one of those
48.96,types of headaches is as well as
51.18,fortunately the many excellent
53.34,treatments that exist for the different
55.02,types of headache in fact what we'll
56.699,soon discuss is that by understanding
59.1,which type of headache you have and a
61.44,little bit about the underlying biology
63.059,of each different type of headache it
65.4,becomes quite straightforward to select
67.02,the best treatment options for you to
69.659,for instance provide relief from
71.64,frequent and recurring tension headaches
73.92,cluster headaches even sinus headaches
75.6,the sorts of headaches that are
76.56,associated with sinus infections and
78.6,colds where the sinuses get clogged up
80.759,and you experience headache so while
82.32,today's episode focuses on all aspects
84.42,and types of headaches it will have
86.7,tremendous relevance for everybody so
88.68,for those of you that experience
89.939,headache every once in a while where
91.92,only when you're sick or have a sinus
93.42,headache or for those of you that suffer
95.159,from debilitating migraines today's
97.56,conversation actually has a bit of
99.479,optimism woven into it meaning there are
102.36,excellent treatments for each and every
103.92,one of the different types of headaches
105.6,and I was quite impressed and excited to
108.24,learn when researching this episode that
110.64,the treatments for headache range from
112.619,of course prescription drug treatments
114.479,and over-the-counter medications of the
116.939,sort of type that most of us have heard
118.68,about ibuprofen acetaminophen and so
120.72,forth so-called anti-inflammatory drugs
123.299,but it turns out there are many natural
125.939,treatments for headaches that when
128.819,compared to those over-the-counter drugs
130.92,and even some prescription drugs appear
133.62,to be easily as effective and in many
135.78,cases more effective than the typical
138.18,drug treatments many of which can carry
140.4,side effects that is the drug treatments
142.08,carry side effects whereas the natural
143.819,treatments appear to not carry side
145.92,effects now of course anytime we have a
147.66,discussion about natural treatments
149.16,there are likely to be some eye rolls
151.14,out there and people thinking oh you
152.4,know this is going to be a bunch of woo
154.98,science well far from it as you'll soon
157.5,learn today each and every one of the
159.36,treatments for each and every one of the
160.739,different kinds of headaches is grounded
163.08,in solid biological understanding of why
165.78,that particular treatment ought to work
167.28,and does work so for instance you'll
169.44,learn that some headache arises because
171.0,of muscular pain other headache arises
172.92,because of excessive vasodilation the
175.8,arteries and blood vessels get bigger
177.599,and wider and so there's a pressure and
179.58,a swelling within the cranium that
181.68,people experience as a headache and it
183.959,turns out that many of the more natural
185.58,treatments out there can address either
187.8,the muscular pain issue or the
190.5,vasodilation issue or other issues and
192.84,underlying mechanisms for headache so
195.18,again while headaches are very intrusive
197.819,irritating and in some cases
199.14,debilitating there is certainly light at
201.72,the end of this tunnel meaning by the
203.7,end of today's episode each and every
205.56,one of you will have an array of
207.18,excellent treatment options that you can
209.64,choose from in order to address and
212.28,provide relief from any of the different
213.959,types of headache before we begin I'd
216.42,like to emphasize that this podcast is
218.22,separate from my teaching and research
219.48,roles at Stanford it is however part of
221.76,my desire and effort to bring zero cost
223.799,to Consumer information about science
225.42,and science related tools to the general
227.34,public in keeping with that theme I'd
229.62,like to thank the sponsors of today's
231.06,podcast our first sponsor is thesis
233.7,thesis makes custom nootropics and as
236.519,many of you know I'm not a fan of the
238.14,word nootropics because nootropics means
240.0,smart drugs and as a neuroscientist I
242.76,can tell you there is no neural circuit
244.5,in the brain for being smart thesis
246.72,understands this and has designed
248.28,different nootropics in order to bring
250.14,your brain into specific States for
252.12,specific types of work so for instance
253.739,for Creative work or to engage with more
256.68,Focus or to give you more energy for
258.54,cognitive or physical work so with
260.22,thesis they'll design custom nootropics
262.139,for you that will allow you more focus
264.24,better task switching more creativity
266.1,and so on and they'll be sure to include
268.38,only the ingredients that you want and
270.06,not the ingredients that you don't I've
272.04,been using thesis for more than a year
273.78,now and I can confidently say that their
275.58,neutropics have been a total game
276.96,changer for me I like the clarity
279.06,formula prior to Long bouts of cognitive
281.1,work or the Energy Formula prior to
283.139,physical workouts if you'd like to try
285.3,your own personalized nootropic starter
287.04,kit go online to takethesis.com huberman
289.74,you'll take a brief three-minute quiz
291.66,and thesis will send you four different
293.04,formulas to try on your first month
294.72,again that's takethesis.com huberman and
297.72,use the code Huber minute checkout for
299.34,10 off your first box today's episode is
302.04,also brought To Us by element element is
304.259,an electrolyte drink that has everything
305.759,you need and nothing you don't that
307.5,means the exact ratios of electrolytes
309.84,are an element and those are sodium
312.0,magnesium and potassium but it has no
314.639,sugar I've talked many times before on
316.5,this podcast about the key role of
318.12,hydration and electrolytes for nerve
321.84,cell function neuron function as well as
323.46,the function of all the cells and all
325.259,the tissues and organ systems of the
326.82,body
327.6,if we have sodium magnesium and
329.639,potassium present in the proper ratios
331.32,all of those cells function properly and
333.9,all our bodily systems can be optimized
336.419,if the electrolytes are not present and
338.699,if hydration is low we simply can't
341.22,think as well as we would otherwise our
343.68,mood is off hormone systems go off our
345.9,ability to get into physical action to
348.06,engage in endurance and strength and all
349.86,sorts of other things is diminished so
352.38,with element you can make sure that
353.82,you're staying on top of your hydration
355.139,and that you're getting the proper
356.82,ratios of electrolytes if you'd like to
358.74,try element you can go to drink element
360.36,that's lmnt.com huberman and you'll get
363.539,a free element sample pack with your
365.16,purchase they're all delicious so again
366.78,if you want to try element you can go to
369.08,element.com huberman today's episode is
372.539,also brought To Us by Maui Nui which I
374.639,can confidently say is the most nutrient
376.32,dense and delicious red meat available
377.9,Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building
380.52,a USDA certified wild harvesting system
383.22,to help balance invasive deer
384.72,populations on the island of Maui I've
387.18,talked before more on this podcast and
388.979,we've had guests on this podcast that
390.72,have emphasized the critical role of
392.699,getting quality protein not just for
395.039,muscle repair and protein synthesis but
396.96,also for repair of all tissues including
399.18,brain tissue on a day-to-day basis and
402.0,the general rule of thumb for that is
403.8,one gram of quality protein per pound of
406.139,body weight per day with Maui Nui meats
408.6,you can accomplish that very easily and
410.52,you can do that without ingesting in
412.319,excess of calories which is also
413.88,critical for immediate and long-term
415.62,health I should say that Maui Nui meats
417.539,are not only extremely high quality but
420.06,they are also delicious I particularly
422.46,like they're jerky so they're venison
424.02,jerky I also have had Maui Nui venison
426.479,in various recipes including ground
429.0,venison some venison steaks and I love
431.94,the taste of the venison it's lean but
434.22,it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at
436.319,all it's incredibly delicious so if
438.539,you'd like to try Maui Nui venison go to
440.78,mauinuyvenison.com huberman to get 20
443.28,off your first order again that's Maui
445.44,News venison.com
447.599,to get 20 off your first order the
450.12,huberman Lab podcast is now partnered
451.74,with momentous supplements to find the
453.419,supplements we discuss on the huberman
454.68,Lab podcast you can go to live momentous
456.96,spelled ous live momentous.com huberman
460.199,and I should just mention that the
461.639,library of those supplements is
462.84,constantly expanding again that's
464.78,livemomentis.com huberman let's talk
467.819,about headaches and as we are soon going
470.4,to learn there are different types of
471.599,headaches and different types of
474.12,headaches arise from changes in
476.28,different types of tissues in the head
478.44,area and indeed in the neck area as well
481.979,now one of the key things to understand
483.84,is that if you want relief from a
486.18,headache you need to understand which
488.16,tissue is mainly involved in creating
491.34,that type of headache so for instance
493.38,many people suffer from what are called
494.819,tension headaches now tension headaches
496.86,are a little bit of a misnomer because
498.539,many people might think oh tension I'm
500.34,under a lot of tension and stress and
501.72,therefore I get tension headaches and
503.22,indeed stress can cause tension
505.199,headaches but tension headaches are
507.06,really the sort of headache that you
508.56,feel around the top part of the head not
511.68,the very top but sort of where you would
513.3,put a headband so above the eyes and
515.219,around the head it doesn't have to be
516.599,experienced all the way around the head
518.399,but the main underlying reason that is
520.62,the tissue system that mainly underlies
523.26,tension headaches is the muscular system
525.779,there are a lot of muscles on the skull
528.36,Believe It or Not of course on the neck
530.04,and they allow you to move your neck and
531.54,head
532.44,there are a lot of muscles that lie
534.899,parallel to the skull and oftentimes
537.06,those muscles will undergo excessive
539.519,amounts of constriction
541.2,now there are of course muscles and the
543.0,jaw that can also lead to headache and
544.5,jaw ache and things of that sort and
546.12,neck aches and headaches so what we're
548.339,really pointing out here is that the
550.26,muscles are a key player in the
553.2,formation of different types of headache
554.76,Tension Headache in particular but of
557.339,course muscles and muscle tension can be
560.1,evolved in the other types of headaches
561.839,as well okay so I just want to highlight
563.459,muscular issues as one particular source
566.76,of the ache in headaches the other
569.22,tissue that can be prominently involved
571.44,in generating the ache of a headache or
573.779,the so-called meninges now the meninges
576.12,in addition to being a fun word to say
578.7,or a bunch of tissues that line the
582.24,outside of the brain and reside between
585.12,the brain and the skull so you might
587.58,think okay between the brain and the
588.779,skull there's probably just a little bit
589.8,of fluid and the brain is right up next
591.24,to the skull but it turns out that's not
592.5,the case the brain is actually encased
594.3,in a very thick very durable Sac or
598.019,casing that's wrapped around it tight
600.12,like Saran wrap it actually has a name
602.399,which is dura d-u-r-a and so you can
605.519,remember Dura durable and having done
607.8,some surgeries many surgeries before on
610.14,brains of different types ranging from
612.66,Human even though I'm not a neurosurgeon
614.94,as a clinician ranging from Human to
617.7,other types of species what you find is
620.279,that the dura is exceedingly durable
622.5,getting through this thing really
623.88,requires an a very sharp razor blade so
626.7,the brain is actually sitting in a very
628.86,fibrous like Sac that you simply could
631.62,not open up with your fingertips under
633.899,any conditions it's really durable the
636.54,meninges are in that general area and
639.66,also encasing the brain and the meninges
642.0,provide an additional buffer between the
644.88,brain and the dura and the skull so
647.519,again you don't want to think about the
648.66,brain as just sitting right next to the
650.1,skull it's close by but there are a
651.779,bunch of other thin fibrous tissues many
654.06,of which are very thin and fragile and
656.7,others of which such as the dura that
658.56,are very very strong because they're
661.5,very fibrous almost like a uh if you've
663.779,ever felt for instance the sale of a of
666.18,a sailboat you might think oh it's just
668.16,this big flapping sheet in the wind it
669.72,is anything but a sheet in the Wind it
672.18,is a very very strong and durable
674.1,material now the proximity of the dura
676.32,and the meninges to the brain and the
677.76,fact that everything is wrapped very
679.079,tightly together and the fact that
681.24,there's a lot of vasculature so that
682.8,would be arteries blood vessels and
684.18,capillaries are all in that area on the
686.04,top of the brain and throughout the
687.18,brain the fact that all of that is in
689.04,very close proximity and wrapped really
690.899,tight in this very durable sac
694.14,is one of the reasons why when blood
697.8,vessels or arteries or both become
700.44,dilated they open there creates a
703.019,pressure between the brain and those
705.36,tissues and because there isn't much
707.339,distance between the tissues like the
709.68,dura and the meninges and the skull
711.3,there's also pressure that allows for
714.12,the brain to literally sneak up or I
716.94,should say give the impression that your
719.399,brain is expanding up against your skull
721.32,so the point here is that while muscular
723.42,tension can give rise to headache the
725.399,other thing that can give rise to
726.48,headache is so-called vasodilation the
728.82,expansion or the widening of the
731.04,arteries blood vessels and capillaries
733.2,and one of the reasons why that gives
734.64,rise to headache is because there's
735.959,simply not a lot of space for that
738.36,expansion to go it doesn't allow
741.18,anything except for the brain to push up
743.04,against that very durable tissue and
745.2,that very durable tissue to push up
746.579,against the skull and even though the
749.04,brain itself doesn't have pain receptors
751.62,that's right the brain itself doesn't
753.42,have pain receptors that is why a
755.339,neurosurgeon can take off a piece of
756.72,skull and can probe around in the brain
758.64,with an electrode and the person is
759.959,completely unaware and in order to get
762.0,through the skull of course that little
763.68,skin flap has to remove be removed from
765.6,the skull and that requires a little bit
767.7,of topical anesthetic but really you
769.5,don't need any anesthetic to go into the
771.36,brain itself because there aren't pain
772.5,receptors on the brain itself however
774.54,the tissues surrounding the brain such
777.839,as the dura the meninges and the
780.18,vasculature that then reaches up believe
782.579,it or not into the skull the vasculature
784.62,doesn't actually stop right beneath the
786.06,skull it actually blood vessels it get
787.8,into the skull and they're actually
789.32,portals by which blood can move within
791.76,the skull itself well what that means is
793.68,that since all of the tissues are very
795.36,close by and very compact
797.339,with respect to one another any increase
799.86,in the size of the portals that allow
802.68,movement of blood there
804.3,and the fact that there are what are
806.519,called nociceptors noci nociceptors
809.22,These are essentially pain receptors
811.519,because of the presence of pain
813.54,receptors in the tissues around the
815.579,brain
817.019,when there's an increase in the size of
819.24,those vascular portals the arteries
821.519,capillaries and vessels
823.44,we experience that as intense pain and
826.56,pressure and fortunately there are
828.6,excellent treatments for dealing with
829.92,that intense pain and pressure but keep
832.5,in mind that the intense pain and
834.06,pressure that is the consequence of
836.04,vasodilation that is the widening of
838.2,these different vascular portals
840.36,is very different than the type of pain
841.98,that arises from muscular tension as is
844.5,the case with Tension Headache okay so
846.54,now we have two sources of pain that is
849.12,the ache in headache and there are two
850.92,more that we need to think about in
852.54,trying to better understand the
853.8,different types of headaches that we'll
855.06,discuss and in terms of trying to
856.98,understand which are going to be the
858.48,best treatments for the different types
859.8,of headaches and those are neural and
862.8,inflammatory responses so let's talk
864.48,about the neural type first there is a
866.519,type of headache that many people
867.959,unfortunately suffer from we'll get into
870.24,this in a bunch more detail in a moment
872.399,but those are called cluster headaches
874.74,cluster headaches are headaches that
876.6,arise not from the surface people don't
879.48,experience them as kind of a tightening
881.279,of the forehead and the neck and the jaw
882.899,but rather it feels as if the headache
884.76,is coming from deep within the head and
886.62,in particular from behind the orbit of
888.839,one or the other eyes and sometimes both
891.12,eyes for those of you that have ever
892.86,experienced cluster headaches they are
894.72,extremely painful even the more where I
897.839,should say the relatively more minor
899.76,cluster headaches are extremely painful
901.26,and the severe ones are exceedingly
902.88,painful
904.199,cluster headaches arise from Deep where
907.44,this we get the Sensation that they are
908.94,rising from deep within our head as
910.5,opposed from the surface inward because
912.959,they are neural in origin and there's a
915.06,particular nerve pathway called the
917.82,trigeminal nerve that often is the
921.0,origin of these cluster headaches that
922.98,people experience behind the eye the
924.72,trigeminal as the name suggests has
926.22,three branches try Okay so there's a
928.86,branch that essentially extends to the
931.44,eye there's also a branch that extends
933.959,to the mandible right to the uh to the
936.839,lip and there's a branch that extends
938.76,more or less to the to the nasal area
941.339,and so this trigeminal nerve becomes
944.88,inflamed or in other ways is hyper
947.459,activated in some cases and that causes
950.579,the Deep pain below the eye because it
953.279,is that first branch of the trigeminal
955.019,nerve which is the ophthalmic branch
956.76,which tends to be activated first so
959.04,people start feeling as if there's a
960.48,pain behind their eye in particular on
962.16,one side oftentimes there's lacrimation
964.079,which is tearing up there can be some
966.24,nasal discharge another common symptom
968.459,of this type of headache that is the
970.44,cluster headache is that the pupil
972.06,sometimes will become very small the
974.1,pupils of the eyes and they won't dilate
976.139,even in darkness so there are a bunch of
978.54,things that are going on on one or both
980.76,sides of the face that seem to arise
982.44,from deep within the head or it's almost
985.38,as if it's coming from the brain outward
987.06,and that's because it's neural in origin
988.74,Okay so we've got muscular origins of
991.079,headaches we've got meningeal
993.779,origins of headaches that is the the
995.88,stuff around the brain and as it relates
997.68,to the vasculature and we have neural
999.839,origins of headaches and of course
1002.36,there's inflammation origins of
1004.639,headaches now inflammation is a term
1006.019,that gets thrown around a lot these days
1007.639,people are talking about you know this
1008.959,reduces inflammation inflammation is bad
1010.94,and and I I suppose in some cases and
1013.459,when inflammation is really widespread
1015.38,across the brainer body it's bad but I
1017.54,don't think any of us should think about
1018.62,inflammation per se as bad what I mean
1021.68,is inflammation is just one form of
1024.38,signaling in the body which of course
1026.839,includes the brain
1028.16,inflammation of a tissue is one way in
1031.579,which a set of cells so these could be
1033.559,for instance uh cells of the immune
1035.959,system and we cover this in a detailed
1038.0,episode all about the immune system if
1039.5,you'd like to check that out you go to
1040.52,hubermanlab.com just put into our search
1042.319,function immune system and you can find
1044.12,that episode by the way all of our
1045.679,episodes are searchable by keyword
1047.12,hubermanlab.com and it'll take you to
1048.799,specific episodes and time stamps for
1051.2,the topics you're interested in so for
1053.48,sake of this discussion about headache
1056.539,inflammation is going to be the case
1059.0,when one particular tissue in and around
1061.34,the head area is releasing molecules
1064.6,cytokines which sometimes are called
1066.559,inflammatory cytokines but there are
1068.179,also non-inflammatory or
1069.44,anti-inflammatory cytokines but
1071.48,inflammatory molecules that are
1073.64,signaling to the rest of the body hey
1075.2,there's something going on here there's
1076.64,either some intrusive object and indeed
1079.16,if you were to get you know a bb or a
1081.26,splinter into a particular uh you know
1083.66,skin area there'd be a lot of
1084.74,inflammation so it could be the
1085.82,introduction of a foreign physical
1086.96,object into an area that will cause
1088.4,inflammation it can be the presence of
1090.559,some sort of local toxin in that area it
1093.74,could be a more systemic inflammation
1096.02,nonetheless inflammation in the neck and
1100.039,head area where frankly anywhere within
1103.039,the sinus area so this would include the
1104.72,mouth the nose around the eyes because
1106.76,the sinuses many of us think of sinuses
1108.679,as just our nose but actually if I were
1110.24,to show you a skull a human skull or any
1112.34,other kind of skull
1113.539,you'd be very hopefully intrigued to
1116.9,learn that the skull is just not one big
1119.48,piece of solid bone or a you know a top
1121.7,with a jaw below it it actually has all
1124.28,these small what are called
1125.059,fenestrations little holes and canals
1127.34,that run through the skull and through
1129.26,the depth of the skull like little tubes
1131.179,you've got them down here on your
1132.74,mandible you've got them above your lips
1135.08,you have them um on either sides of your
1137.059,nose those are the sinuses the sinuses
1139.16,allow the passage of different fluids
1140.96,through the skull because the skull even
1143.12,though it's bone it's not a dead tissue
1145.28,right in a live person or animal the
1147.74,skull is a very active
1149.96,living tissue indeed all bone is active
1152.96,living tissue and it needs to be
1154.52,nourished with blood it needs to be
1156.32,nourished with cerebral spinal fluid in
1158.179,the case of the skull it needs to be
1159.2,nourished with all sorts of important
1160.52,things so those sinuses oftentimes can
1163.039,become clogged as is in the case with
1164.78,sinus headache which we'll talk about in
1166.46,a little bit but more generally anytime
1169.039,there's inflammation of one given area
1171.559,of the body so it could be a shoulder it
1173.96,could be the neck it could be the mouth
1175.039,it could be the nose or in the case of
1176.78,the headache it could be any portion of
1180.02,the head or neck
1181.64,what happens is inflammation while it's
1184.34,a very efficient signal it's much like
1186.86,the siren on an ambulance or a police
1189.32,car and that it sends out a very broad
1190.94,signal that's very clear something is
1192.74,wrong here and needs to be dealt with
1194.419,it's not very specific so it's very
1198.02,robust but it's not very specific so for
1200.48,instance if there's a little bacterial
1202.16,infection or a little viral infection
1204.02,the inflammation response to that site
1206.66,of infection tends to be far more
1208.34,widespread than the actual site of
1211.34,infection it's a little bit different
1212.66,when you have a foreign object there
1214.1,like a splinter or some other foreign
1215.84,object that tends to be a bit more
1217.22,localized and the immune system is
1219.02,always trying to limit the the extent of
1221.72,inflammation by putting in different
1223.039,scar tissues indeed a lot of the things
1225.08,that we think of as kind of gross
1226.76,you know pustules and boils and things
1228.38,like that I know it's a gross topic are
1230.059,ways in which our body tries to restrict
1232.64,the amount of inflammation but the face
1235.88,area and the head itself are so heavily
1238.88,infused with blood vessels and there's a
1241.28,constant perfusion as we say of blood
1243.32,and cerebral spinal fluid and other
1244.82,things through this incredibly
1246.14,metabolically active tissue that we call
1247.82,our brain and our eyes those are by far
1250.46,the most metabolically active tissues in
1252.2,our entire body even if we're running
1253.82,hundreds of miles in Ultra marathons
1256.16,your brain is still far more
1258.02,metabolically demanding than all the
1259.58,muscles of your body combined no matter
1261.679,what the conditions because of that
1263.78,there tends to be a generalization or a
1265.58,spreading out of any inflammatory
1267.26,response and that inflammatory response
1269.72,then can trigger the pain mechanisms or
1273.2,what we've experience as pain mechanisms
1275.12,in the other three types of tissues that
1277.039,we talked about so for instance if you
1278.419,have a systemic infection or you're
1281.059,experiencing inflammation of any kind
1282.679,and it has anything to do with or
1284.72,encroaches on the face or head area that
1287.9,can easily and almost always
1290.179,spills over into activation of nerve
1292.82,cells can give rise to neural based
1294.86,headache or to the meninges and can give
1296.9,rise to meningeal headaches and of
1298.76,course to the muscles and to muscular
1300.679,type headaches so we've got muscular
1302.84,origins of the ache in headache we have
1305.0,meningeal origins of the achin headache
1307.58,we have neural origins of the aching
1309.919,headache and we have inflammation-based
1312.08,origins of the ache in headache and that
1314.659,pertains to all the different types of
1316.1,headaches that we're going to talk about
1317.24,and it's important to keep in mind that
1319.28,there are these different sources of the
1321.32,ache and headache and that sometimes
1323.0,they exist alone and sometimes they
1324.679,exist in combination however this isn't
1327.38,important however
1328.94,all pain
1330.86,or I should say all experience of pain
1333.26,as a perception
1334.88,is going to be neural in origin when we
1337.58,experience pain whether or not it's a
1339.14,pin prick or a cut stub our toe we trip
1342.32,and fall or a headache it is neural in
1345.38,origin it is the nervous system and
1347.24,nerve cells that are going to carry that
1349.94,signal that we perceive as pain so as we
1352.76,talk about the different sources of pain
1354.38,and different types of headache we will
1356.36,also talk about of course I think what
1358.34,most people are interested in today's
1359.659,discussion the different treatments for
1361.4,the different types of headache and why
1362.84,each of those different treatments work
1364.22,but by understanding a little bit about
1366.74,how pain arises in the nervous system
1368.6,and certainly by understanding the
1370.7,different types of headaches you know
1372.38,what is a tension headache I gave you
1373.82,some impression that it's running around
1375.26,your head like a headband in many cases
1377.48,versus cluster headache which starts
1380.059,deep below the eye often it feels as if
1382.4,it's emerging from deep in the brain
1383.6,versus migraine which we'll get into in
1385.7,a moment by understanding the different
1387.5,types of headaches you should be able to
1389.12,quickly pinpoint what type of headache
1391.76,you have what types of tissues are
1394.159,likely involved and therefore what types
1397.159,of treatments are going to most quickly
1398.9,and most completely relieve that type of
1401.36,headache okay so for the next three to
1403.039,five minutes and I promise no more I'm
1405.32,going to explain how pain arises at the
1407.78,level of nerve cells and I suppose this
1410.78,is one of those times when if I had a
1412.64,highlighter pen that could go out and
1414.2,across the the microphones and speakers
1417.26,leading to your ears
1419.48,I would use it here because what I'm
1421.34,about to tell you is perhaps one of the
1422.72,most important things to understand
1423.919,about your nervous system that is your
1425.84,brain and you which is that while you
1428.36,have trillions of neurons and we hear
1429.799,that you have trillions and different
1430.94,types of neurons in your brain and they
1432.32,come in different shapes and sizes and
1433.76,do different things and some make
1434.9,dopamine and some make serotonin and so
1437.36,make glutamate and on and on
1440.179,the key distinction among different
1442.28,types of neurons that is the three types
1445.039,of neurons that I believe everybody
1446.419,scientists are no everybody should
1448.76,understand exist are some neurons nerve
1452.12,cells are what we call motor neurons in
1454.58,the sense that they control the
1456.86,contraction of muscles sometimes for
1458.96,walking other neurons control the
1462.02,movements of your fingers scientists
1463.94,call those digits
1465.44,other ones your toes
1467.179,they also control the beating of your
1469.039,heart
1469.94,although that's a slightly different
1471.38,mechanism and slightly different type of
1473.96,tissue than is involved in generating
1476.299,motor movements of your limbs
1478.52,these are neurons that we call motor
1480.62,neurons because their goal or their
1483.679,purpose I should say they don't really
1485.12,know what their their goal or purpose is
1486.62,but what they do is they make sure that
1488.78,muscles contract so that certain things
1491.12,happen in your body like your heart
1492.98,beats or you move your limbs you lift
1494.6,your eyelids or your eyebrows rather
1497.539,and so on and so forth
1499.7,other types of neurons are what we call
1501.44,Sensory neurons
1502.94,they communicate
1504.74,the same way that motor neurons do that
1506.78,is they fire what we call Action
1508.039,potentials which are just electrical
1509.419,signals they release neurotransmitters
1510.98,like any other neuron but they respond
1513.559,to certain events in the environment or
1517.039,the environment within the body
1519.26,but they are not responsible for
1521.36,generating muscular contractions so we
1523.46,call these Sensory neurons some Sensory
1525.08,neurons sense light touch other Sensory
1528.02,neurons sense firm touch other sensory
1530.72,neurons sense pain other Sensory neurons
1533.26,sense light brushing on the skin in fact
1536.0,you have Sensory neurons believe it or
1537.38,not that respond specifically to the
1540.08,light brushing of a hand across your
1542.539,skin any region of your body and if that
1545.24,particular region of your body happens
1546.679,to have hair on it and you stroke the
1549.74,skin in the direction that the hairs lay
1551.659,down
1552.559,we experience that as pleasurable
1554.179,whereas if you stroke in the direction
1555.799,opposite to the the way the hairs lay
1558.02,down we experience that as not
1559.64,pleasurable so these Sensory neurons
1561.62,respond in some cases for instance
1563.96,within the auditory system they respond
1566.0,to sound waves and your eye they respond
1567.5,to photons of light sometimes photons of
1569.72,light of particular wavelengths that we
1571.159,think of as red green blue and so on
1572.86,Sensory neurons don't move muscles they
1575.659,respond to things in the environment and
1577.46,they exist within us so we have Sensory
1579.919,neurons that sense for instance pressure
1581.539,within our head or pressure within our
1584.6,gut how full or empty our gut is
1587.299,pain within our tissues like our liver
1590.0,or or any kind of other internal organ
1592.94,so we've got motor neurons Sensory
1594.74,neurons and then the last kind of neuron
1596.96,is what we call modulatory neurons these
1599.779,are the ones that adjust the
1601.1,relationship between the sensory neurons
1603.02,and the motor neurons to determine
1604.94,whether or not we do anything in
1607.4,response to a sensory input that is
1610.159,whether or not if a sensory neuron fires
1612.86,sends it electrical potential whether or
1614.779,not it will generate a motor change let
1618.26,me give you a very simple example of
1619.7,this so for those of you listening I'll
1622.1,just explain what I'm doing and for
1623.419,those of you watching you'll be able to
1624.74,see I'm holding my hand out in front of
1626.12,me
1626.779,if I were to touch the top of my hand
1628.88,with my fingertip I can deliberately
1631.58,override that is I can modulate that
1635.179,more typical reflex which is that when
1636.799,something touches us if we're not aware
1638.36,of where it's coming from we typically
1639.86,move away from that thing that touches
1641.299,this is a very natural response but we
1643.22,can decide we're not going to move away
1644.299,we can decide to stay still or we can
1646.58,decide to move toward the thing that
1647.96,touches us but typically if you were to
1649.34,walk up to somebody and you were to
1650.72,touch them they'd either turn toward you
1652.22,on the side that you touch them or
1653.96,they'd step away it's rare that they're
1655.76,going to step into you but you could
1657.919,decide that you were not going to move
1659.12,away or you could step into the
1660.799,direction of touch and that's because
1662.299,you have modulatory neurons that can
1663.919,adjust the conversation in a very
1665.659,context-dependent way
1668.48,as to whether or not the sensory neuron
1670.94,will cause motor neurons to contract or
1674.0,not okay so we've got motor neuron
1676.64,Sensory neurons and modulatory neurons
1678.32,and you're probably thinking by now why
1679.58,are we talking about this I thought we
1680.6,were talking about headache I thought
1681.62,we're going to talk about treatments for
1682.46,headache but this turns out to be very
1683.96,important because you could imagine and
1686.48,in a moment I'll explain how let's say
1688.52,you have tension headaches you're
1689.84,somebody that has the classic symptoms
1691.76,of tension headache let me tell you what
1693.08,those are these are headaches again that
1696.26,occur more or less on on the in a kind
1698.419,of a headband like fashion or they tend
1700.159,to start there
1701.299,and exist around that these are very
1703.22,common they can arise from a number of
1705.2,different sources rise from sleep
1708.02,deprivation they can rise from excessive
1710.539,use of caffeine intake we'll talk about
1712.1,why that is they can arise from stress
1714.919,they can arise from very low level viral
1718.88,infections or bacterial infections but
1720.74,we experience these as just as headaches
1722.299,where you've been thinking too hard or
1724.159,working too hard or life has been
1725.6,stressful they're often also associated
1727.34,with jaw pain and jaw tightness and neck
1729.919,tightness so tension headaches
1731.059,everything you'd imagine muscular
1732.44,tension could cause well if you want to
1734.48,treat tension headache
1736.52,you can imagine that because all
1738.559,headache is neural that you'd want to go
1740.659,after some sort of neural mechanism to
1742.22,treat them but of course we now know
1744.919,that there are three types of neurons
1747.02,there are motor neurons Sensory neurons
1749.0,and modulatory neurons so we have
1751.52,choices we can say okay do we want to
1753.62,turn off the muscles in the head jaw and
1756.44,neck that are hyper contracted
1758.659,for instance you want to take a muscle
1760.52,relaxer or relaxedant
1763.46,or would you want to try and change the
1766.88,sensory input itself maybe don't change
1768.919,the way the muscles are behaving but
1770.48,shut off the sensory part of it your
1773.12,ability to sense it
1774.679,there are certainly ways you can do that
1777.02,or would you want to adjust the
1779.059,modulatory neurons would you want to
1780.98,make it such that you have the headache
1782.659,but you don't perceive the headache that
1784.64,is you cut off communication between the
1786.74,sensor and the motor so that the muscles
1788.72,relax turns out there are treatments and
1791.179,approaches for each and every one of
1792.559,those each and every one of those has
1794.299,different advantages and disadvantages
1796.46,but as you can quickly see we are going
1799.52,to have different types of headaches and
1800.899,different approaches to treating
1802.039,headache but if you keep in the back of
1803.36,your mind that you have neurons that
1804.799,contract muscles to create movement or
1807.02,tension of muscles remember you can turn
1809.779,off those neurons and allow those
1811.039,muscles to relax you have Sensory
1812.539,neurons that sense input and actually
1814.82,sense the pain and you have modulatory
1816.799,neurons which can allow you to adjust
1818.419,the relationship between the sensory
1820.58,neurons and the motor neurons and of
1822.2,course some of you are probably
1822.98,screaming at me by now saying wait why
1825.26,would you ever want to deal with the
1826.52,motor neurons or or the modulatory
1828.679,neurons once you want to just go
1829.7,straight to the source and just cut off
1831.08,the pain ah well the problem there is
1833.779,that many painkillers
1836.059,have other issues as well in particular
1838.64,they can be sedative many of them can be
1840.799,habit forming or even addictive and for
1843.5,many people not all but many people they
1845.539,don't want to take drugs whether or not
1846.86,they're over-the-counter or prescription
1848.059,drugs or even more natural supplement
1850.159,based type treatments
1852.559,and they would rather use for instance
1855.14,a behavioral approach in which they can
1857.84,modulate they can deliberately turn off
1859.82,the communication between Sensory
1861.38,neurons and motor neurons and turns out
1862.82,those approaches exist as well okay so
1865.399,at this point I promise you that I'm not
1867.62,going to give you any more of a biology
1869.12,lesson in terms of pain sensing and
1871.76,headaches as a more uh conceptual
1874.34,phenomenon instead what I'd like to do
1876.08,next is talk about the different types
1877.82,of headaches and I think this is
1879.62,something that's very important and not
1881.059,often discussed except for those people
1882.799,out there that unfortunately suffer
1884.779,repeatedly from certain kinds of
1886.34,headaches like migraine or cluster or
1888.2,tension headache but I think for most
1890.48,people out there who experience headache
1891.98,and again that is everybody at some
1893.899,point experiences headache rather than
1896.48,just think of headache as one thing
1898.299,understanding the major types of
1900.679,headache and how they differ from and
1903.08,are similar to one another will really
1905.0,help you identify what the best source
1906.86,of treatments for those are so I'd like
1908.779,to talk about what the different types
1909.919,of headache are now the first type of
1912.02,headache we're going to discuss is the
1913.52,tension type headache again tension type
1915.74,headaches tend to start off not always
1918.2,but tend to start off as more or less a
1921.08,Halo or a headband around the forehead
1923.36,in the area above the eyes often also
1926.299,include the jaw the neck muscles
1928.94,and can extend even into the upper back
1931.299,again this can be caused by some low
1934.34,level of infection but more often than
1936.26,not tension type headaches are going to
1937.7,come on because of some chronic
1940.7,psychological stress usually combined
1942.679,with lack of sleep usually combined with
1944.44,lifestyle issues and of course without
1947.84,getting into a long discussion about it
1949.22,anytime you have lack of sleep you're
1950.96,going to have excessive stress anytime
1952.399,you have excessive stress you're going
1954.14,to have to make sure you're offsetting
1956.299,that by getting proper sleep most people
1957.74,don't when they're under excessive
1959.0,stress by the way we have excellent
1960.38,tools we're grounded in excellent
1962.6,science available to you at zero cost if
1964.76,you are experienced chronic stress or
1966.62,even short-term stress we have a master
1968.179,stress episode of the human Lab podcast
1970.82,again just go to hubermanlab.com and all
1972.679,that's time stamped for you tension type
1974.659,headaches
1975.919,begin in a more or less a headband
1978.44,pattern but can really extend to other
1980.0,tissues as well not so often in the face
1982.7,but really the head and often will start
1985.46,to climb up toward the top of the head
1987.14,they are not always in this Halo pattern
1989.779,sometimes they can be localized to one
1991.82,area such as the you know the back of
1993.559,the head or the front of the head or one
1995.179,side of the head more than others and
1997.46,that's often the case because of tension
2000.159,within muscles of the neck that tend to
2002.62,bias the ache towards one side of the
2004.48,head I'd like to take a quick break and
2006.82,acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic
2008.799,greens athletic greens now called ag-1
2011.44,is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
2013.96,that covers all of your foundational
2015.7,nutritional needs I've been taking
2017.679,athletic green since 2012 so I'm
2020.2,delighted that they're sponsoring the
2021.46,podcast the reason I started taking
2022.96,athletic greens and the reason I still
2024.58,take athletic greens once or usually
2026.679,twice a day is that it gets to be the
2029.2,probiotics that I need for gut health
2030.94,our gut is very important it's populated
2033.1,by gut microbiota that communicate with
2035.62,the brain in the immune system and
2037.12,basically all the biological systems of
2038.919,our body to strongly impact our
2041.019,immediate and long-term health
2042.58,and those probiotics and athletic greens
2044.679,are optimal and vital for microbiotic
2047.679,health in addition athletic greens
2049.72,contains a number of adaptogens vitamins
2051.46,and minerals that make sure that all of
2053.08,my foundational nutritional needs are
2054.76,met and it tastes great if you'd like to
2057.879,try athletic greens you can go to
2059.46,athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll
2062.619,give you five free travel packs that
2064.3,make it really easy to mix up athletic
2065.919,greens while you're on the road in the
2067.54,car on the plane Etc and they'll give
2069.58,you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2
2072.22,again that's athleticgreens.com huberman
2074.8,to get the five free travel packs and
2076.659,the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 the
2079.54,other type of headache that
2080.5,unfortunately is very common is migraine
2083.379,headaches migraine headaches are defined
2085.96,generally as disorders of recurring
2088.119,attacks of headaches so people who get
2089.859,migraines often get them in a recurring
2092.379,fashion some people get them very often
2094.24,other people get them less often but
2096.58,migraines are very debilitating the
2099.76,numbers that is the prevalence of
2101.32,migraine is still pretty debated one
2104.92,thing that we know for sure is that
2106.8,females suffer from migraine headaches
2109.06,at a rate at least threefold higher than
2112.48,do males and surprisingly this does not
2115.66,seem to have any direct hormonal origin
2118.24,because we're also going to talk about
2119.579,hormonal headaches that is headaches
2122.38,that relate to a dip in estrogen and
2124.54,progesterone a particular phase of the
2126.099,menstrual cycle that is the ovulatory
2127.66,cycle so there's a bit of a mystery here
2129.52,and the Mystery is why is it that
2131.56,migraine headaches occur at such greater
2133.119,frequency in females even independently
2136.3,of the menstrual cycle so when you
2137.74,control for changes in hormones that
2139.9,still appears to be the case and overall
2141.52,migraines are very common now the
2143.14,numbers on migraine and just how common
2144.76,migraine is
2146.2,are extremely wide this was a little bit
2148.72,frustrating for me in researching this
2150.339,episode
2151.3,you will find for instance that 17 of
2155.14,women suffer from migraines you will
2157.18,also hear that six percent of males
2158.68,suffer from migraines you will also hear
2160.54,that 43 43 percent of females suffer
2165.04,from migraine that is recurring
2167.2,headaches that qualify as migraine
2168.579,headaches and that
2170.74,17 percent of men suffer from migraine
2173.38,headaches on a recurring basis which is
2174.94,again the definition of a migraine
2176.32,headache or one of the key definitions
2177.64,so all we can say for sure is that many
2180.88,many millions of people maybe even
2183.46,billions of people suffer from migraine
2185.859,headaches it's kind of a staggering
2187.78,thing to contemplate but we know it's
2190.72,extremely common and we know that it's
2193.06,more prevalent in females in any of the
2195.88,studies that you will find in terms of
2197.32,that compare the overall prevalence of
2199.18,headache it's going to be higher
2201.4,substantially higher in females and
2202.599,males does not seem to be related to the
2204.52,ovulatory menstrual cycle
2206.26,there are some interesting facts related
2208.3,to that that I'll just you know touch on
2209.74,for a moment
2211.24,pregnancy for whatever reason seems to
2213.64,be protective against migraine headaches
2215.44,that is women who suffer from recurring
2217.119,migraines
2218.64,before they get pregnant when they get
2221.32,pregnant and often after they give birth
2224.68,they experience fewer migraine headaches
2226.54,so there may be something hormonal it
2228.52,may be something else what do we know
2230.32,for sure we know that headache that is
2233.5,the ache in headache is neural so
2235.48,whether or not the origins are hormonal
2237.16,or whether or not the origins are
2238.839,inflammation or gut microbiome or some
2241.119,other feature of the body brain axis
2244.359,at this point all we know is that
2247.66,neural pain or the experience of pain at
2250.3,the neural level is the final common
2251.98,pathway and it's more prevalent in
2253.54,females so as I mentioned migraines tend
2255.94,to be recurring so some people get them
2257.56,once a week some people get them once a
2258.88,month some people get them far more
2260.44,frequently that they can be extremely
2263.02,debilitating oftentimes people
2265.0,experience migraine because it is a
2266.74,recurring phenomenon will know when a
2268.72,migraine is coming on they'll say my
2270.579,migraine is coming on the kind of sense
2272.14,it coming
2273.46,there's this notion of Aura and we'll
2275.8,talk about Aura in a little bit some
2277.839,people think of Aura just as visual aura
2280.119,or the sense of kind of a haloing of
2281.98,light with the sense that there's
2283.96,something outside the body the actual
2286.599,definition of Aura is that
2289.0,it's the experience that something is
2290.92,about to happen it's this kind of
2292.9,feeling of anticipation it's not deja vu
2295.119,deja vu is different and very
2296.8,interesting in its own right but
2297.82,different it's this feeling that
2299.079,something's about to happen and the fact
2300.88,that aura is such a prominent feature of
2302.44,migraine headaches or at least that
2304.06,people feel that the headache is coming
2305.92,on long before they feel the actual ache
2308.32,of the headache and the other
2309.339,debilitating symptoms suggests that
2311.859,migraine has something of deep neural
2314.8,origin that it arises from deep within
2316.78,the nervous system spinal cord and brain
2318.52,and that it's not something like a
2320.2,tension headache that is going from
2322.359,outside in you know the constriction of
2324.04,the muscles in the jaw and head so
2325.359,migraine headaches are very different
2326.56,than tension headaches even in terms of
2328.72,how they come on or their onset the
2332.38,other feature of migraine headaches that
2333.82,I think is important to note is that
2335.92,dilation of the vessels remember the
2338.56,vasodilation so the widening of those
2341.2,pipes that we call arteries vessels and
2344.26,capillaries is a very prominent feature
2346.48,of migraine and fortunately that allows
2348.64,for very particular types of treatment
2350.5,and ways of dealing with this pain
2353.14,specific to migraine headaches the other
2356.32,feature that's common in migraine
2357.64,headaches is so-called photophobia many
2359.68,of you are probably familiar with
2361.0,photophobia if you've ever been sleep
2362.619,deprived
2363.94,simply if you're sleep deprived
2366.52,and you go outside in the morning the
2368.14,light is going to seem very very bright
2369.52,much brighter than were you to have had
2372.16,a really good night's sleep and that's
2373.24,because during sleep there are all sorts
2374.859,of reset mechanisms in the brain there's
2376.3,the washing out of metabolic debris and
2378.64,things in the brain the so-called
2379.72,lymphatic washout That's essential
2381.52,there's also an adjustment of the neural
2383.619,tissue of the eyes which as many of you
2385.42,have heard me say before actually two
2386.74,pieces of rain that have been extruded
2388.48,from the cranial Vault so your eyes yes
2389.92,indeed are two pieces of brain the only
2391.599,two pieces of brain outside the cranial
2392.98,Vault and within your eyes you have
2395.32,neurons and mechanisms that adjust the
2398.2,the sort of sensitivity of your eyes to
2401.5,light and of your brain to light and
2404.02,when you are sleep deprived or when you
2405.76,have a low-level viral infection or a
2407.74,cold or a flu of any kind
2409.96,you tend to experience light as brighter
2412.54,than it actually is when you're rested
2414.16,or you're in the healthy state so
2415.96,photophobia is something that's very
2417.82,very common in migraine and often the
2419.74,photophobia is a prominent feature of
2422.859,the experience that a migraine is coming
2424.599,on people will start saying oh you know
2426.099,it's just too bright in here and
2428.2,normally they'd be able to tolerate that
2429.7,level of sunlight or of indoor lighting
2432.28,with no problem
2433.66,so
2434.8,there are two aspects of migraine that I
2437.079,think are particularly important to
2438.28,understand for sake of of the treatment
2439.72,and that's the dilation of vessels so we
2442.0,if we want to treat migraine we're going
2443.44,to have to think about things that can
2445.06,constrict blood vessels in the brain
2447.4,area but we also need to think about
2448.72,photophobia not photophobia just as a
2451.0,symptom of migraine but that maybe by
2453.22,adjusting our sensitivity to light we
2455.859,can actually short-circuit some of the
2458.5,onset and subsequent pathology of the
2461.92,migraine that is if we can prevent
2463.599,photophobia
2465.16,partially or completely can actually
2467.5,offset a lot of the ache of the migraine
2470.26,that would otherwise occur so that's an
2472.119,exciting Avenue for addressing migraine
2474.88,headaches we'll get into photophobia and
2476.74,how to deal with that we'll also talk
2477.94,about Aura a little bit more in a few
2480.28,minutes but for the time being we've
2481.78,talked about tension headaches we've now
2483.22,talked about migraine headaches again
2484.9,keep in mind knowing what kind of
2486.4,headache you have is essential it's I
2489.099,would say indispensable for selecting
2491.02,the best treatment many people out there
2493.599,will simply get a headache and decide oh
2496.78,I'm going to pop a couple of aspirin
2498.28,okay what does aspirin do aspirin's and
2500.32,anti-inflammatory it also has pronounced
2502.9,effects on the vasodilation and
2504.579,vasoconstriction system it actually
2506.14,allows more blood to flow through those
2509.14,arteries vessels and capillaries a lot
2510.88,of people actually use baby aspirin or
2512.859,small amounts of aspirin as a way to
2514.66,offset cardiovascular disease that's
2516.28,another discussion but what do we know
2518.079,we know that in migraine there's a hyper
2521.079,dilation of the blood vessels a hyper
2522.88,dilation of the very little portals that
2525.099,exist in the brain and around the brain
2527.2,and that are going to cause the pain
2528.94,you're going to activate those Sensory
2530.5,neurons those non-iceceptors that will
2532.54,then give us the experience of extreme
2534.16,headache and migraine so taking an
2536.14,aspirin or something like it for
2538.24,migraine in some cases the worst
2540.46,possible Choice again so knowing what
2542.32,kind of headache you are experiencing is
2544.24,going to be essential here the other
2545.619,thing that you'll sometimes hear is that
2546.82,drinking a cup of coffee or getting
2548.38,caffeine through tea is a great way to
2550.9,deal with headache
2552.22,why would that be well it turns out that
2555.099,coffee can cause either vasoconstriction
2557.2,or vasodilation depending on when you
2559.24,take it and we'll get into the use of
2560.98,caffeine as a treatment for headache
2563.5,because indeed it can be a very potent
2564.94,treatment for headache but you
2567.339,absolutely need to know what kind of
2568.78,headache you are experiencing because in
2571.48,some cases drinking caffeine whether
2573.46,it's in tea or coffee can absolutely
2576.4,alleviate the pain of a headache
2577.9,especially if you catch that onset of a
2580.3,migraine or attention type headache
2581.859,early on but in some cases it can make
2583.839,it far far worse again knowing which
2586.359,type of headache you're experiencing and
2587.92,how the different treatments work is key
2589.48,okay so we have tension type headaches
2591.339,migraine type headaches I think you're
2592.839,starting to get the picture they have
2593.92,different underlying biologies
2598.06,the next type of headache is cluster
2600.339,headaches cluster headaches are the ones
2601.96,I mentioned earlier that arise from deep
2603.64,within the head they feel as if they're
2605.8,coming from the inside out and they tend
2607.54,to be on one side or the other what
2609.64,scientists and clinicians call
2610.839,unilateral and tends to originate behind
2612.76,the eye and sometimes the nose region
2614.859,sometimes in the mouth region as well it
2616.839,feels kind of patchy but as if it's
2618.76,coming from the inside out and again
2620.74,that's because of that trigeminal nerve
2622.42,for those of you listening and not
2624.16,watching this on YouTube I've got three
2626.02,fingers as if I'm putting up three
2627.4,fingers and I'm I've got one pointed
2629.319,toward my eye one pointed towards my
2631.359,nose region and one towards my upper lip
2633.819,the trigeminal nerve is an easy one to
2636.64,remember and it will completely explain
2638.88,cluster headaches and what to do about
2640.78,cluster headaches in a moment if you
2642.04,remember that the herpes one virus and
2644.14,not herpes two not genital herpes but
2646.42,herpes one virus is the one that gives
2648.52,cold sores on the mouth
2650.319,herpes one virus by the way is
2652.0,exceedingly common up to 90 percent of
2653.859,people many children in fact have these
2655.42,again this is not a sexually transmitted
2657.099,herpes although it can be of course
2659.079,transmitted through kissing and sexual
2661.599,contact but that's not the only origin
2663.94,of it okay it can be passed by skin
2665.8,contact and mucosal contact
2668.319,um so mucosomucosal so that would be
2670.119,kissing mucosa lying or even skin to
2672.76,mucosal Linings that's why it's so
2674.319,common and the reason why cold sores
2676.78,develop on the mouth for people that
2678.819,have herpes one is because the virus
2681.579,actually lives on the trigeminal nerve
2684.099,and yes it is true that sometimes the
2687.22,virus will inflame the nerve and the
2689.319,inflammation will occur at the level of
2690.52,the eye so people do unfortunately
2691.78,sometimes get herpes of the eye it
2693.16,actually can be quite dangerous if you
2694.72,have an infection of the eye of a herpes
2696.339,infection in the eye you should see an
2697.54,ophthalmologist or the nose region they
2699.88,can experience pain in the mucosal
2701.26,tissue of the nose more often than not
2703.72,the most inflammation is occurring on
2705.88,the the branch that innervates the lip
2708.22,or the region close to the lip and
2709.66,that's why a cold sword develops there
2711.22,an immune response there signaling that
2714.16,there's inflammation due to the herpes
2715.9,virus which lives on that neuron for a
2718.18,very long time neurons don't turn over
2720.4,in the lifespan so it can live on there
2722.26,for the extent of of the person's life
2724.42,however most people
2727.06,hopefully treat their HSV-1 but if they
2729.64,don't the the sort of frequency and the
2733.0,severity of infections tends to taper
2734.859,off with time we'll have an entire
2736.78,discussion about viruses and herpes in
2738.52,particular in a future episode but the
2741.4,thing to keep in mind here is that this
2743.8,very nerve is the one that gets inflamed
2746.619,in these cluster type headaches now
2748.96,cluster type headaches are associated
2750.7,with a bunch of very uncomfortable
2752.5,symptoms again they tend to be
2754.42,unilateral they tend to begin very deep
2756.76,and they tend to be excruciatingly
2759.04,painful excruciatingly painful they can
2761.26,last anywhere from 30 minutes to three
2762.88,hours some people experience these in
2765.099,sleep in fact this is one of the cases
2767.02,where men experience a headache more
2769.599,than females
2770.98,men experience cluster type headaches
2773.079,that have a sudden onset during sleep at
2775.72,five times the frequency than do females
2777.52,the origins of that aren't exactly clear
2779.319,they do seem to have something to do
2780.88,with the biological clock mechanisms the
2782.74,so-called circadian mechanisms so if you
2785.8,are a man or woman for that matter and
2788.14,you're waking up in the middle of the
2789.099,night with a unilateral headache and it
2790.839,seems like it's deep within your
2792.94,um within your head or it's starting
2794.38,there and it's on one side and localized
2796.42,to the eye and maybe these other regions
2797.74,the trigeminal is involved in you may be
2799.839,suffering from cluster type headache and
2801.52,you should talk to your physician the
2802.96,other symptom that's quite common in
2804.4,cluster type headache is a droopy eyelid
2806.14,which should make sense because the
2807.099,trigeminal innervates the eye region and
2809.38,there are other nerves that control the
2810.52,eyelid but they're in that General
2812.14,region and they can be impacted the
2814.06,other thing is something called meiosis
2815.319,which is that you can't dilate the pupil
2817.0,I mentioned this before so those your
2818.14,pupils might get really really small and
2819.76,they won't dilate and the other thing is
2822.04,lacrimation tearing and then nasal
2824.2,discharge all because of a neural
2825.94,inflammation problem why do I tell you
2828.76,with such detail about cluster headaches
2830.44,well if you are somebody that's
2831.76,experiencing the kind of pain that is
2834.22,consistent with cluster headache taking
2836.44,a standard anti-inflammatory or doing
2839.619,something that is going to adjust the
2841.18,vial the excuse me the dilation or
2843.22,constriction of blood vessels may have
2845.02,an indirect impact on cluster headache
2847.3,but is unlikely to relieve cluster
2849.94,headache either acutely meaning right
2851.98,away or in preventing cluster headaches
2854.38,you have to deal with this as a neural
2856.0,issue and we'll talk about some of the
2858.04,main causes of inflammation and
2860.38,activation of these cluster type
2861.819,headaches at the level of the trigeminal
2863.68,nerve in a little bit because
2864.94,fortunately there are some excellent
2866.2,treatments the next type of headache
2867.94,that is quite common are hormonal
2870.46,headaches now the phrase hormonal
2872.5,headache should already cue you to the
2873.94,fact that it's far too General a term
2876.16,because there's so many different
2877.18,hormones testosterone estrogen thyroid
2879.579,hormone growth hormone and on and on and
2880.839,on
2881.5,and they all have many different
2883.06,functions in the brain and body every
2885.46,single hormone and in particular the
2887.56,so-called steroid hormones steroids
2889.72,again not just limited to things that
2892.54,people take for Sports in fact the
2893.859,steroid hormones refers to estrogen
2895.96,testosterone of the sort that we all
2898.0,make that men and women
2899.619,make naturally and those steroid
2903.22,hormones can impact gene expression they
2905.2,can are of course what turns on the
2907.06,growth of the of the breast tissue of
2909.099,the testicular tissue of the hair growth
2912.04,and on and on and that's all because of
2914.14,gene expression if you're really going
2915.7,to change the identity and function of a
2917.5,cell long term
2918.76,right you're going to literally change
2920.2,the breast tissue or change the penile
2921.94,tissue or change the ovarian tissue in
2924.28,some sort of consistent way across the
2925.72,lifespan you can bet that there are
2927.64,changes in gene expression and those
2928.96,changes in gene expression occur because
2930.4,these steroid hormones have this
2931.78,incredible ability sort of like the
2933.819,X-Men of hormones to pass through the
2936.22,outer membrane of a cell which we call
2938.02,the extracellular membrane and into the
2939.46,so-called nuclear membrane they can go
2941.02,into the area where genes are made and
2943.18,turn on and off different genes however
2945.64,they multitask in their life that is
2949.24,these steroid hormones like estrogen in
2951.46,particular and testosterone in
2952.72,particular can also bind to the surface
2954.819,of cells and impact all sorts of things
2956.56,at the level of the cells that have
2958.66,nothing to do with changes in gene
2959.8,expression and that second mechanism of
2962.079,binding to the surface of cells is one
2963.76,of the ways in which estrogen can
2965.74,control
2966.94,different aspects of headache now that
2970.06,doesn't necessarily mean the estrogen
2971.619,gives you headaches in fact it's just
2974.14,the opposite
2975.22,it turns out that low estrogen and
2977.74,another hormone low progesterone combine
2981.16,to give rise to headache because of the
2983.319,ways that low estrogen and low
2985.66,progesterone impact vasodilation
2988.96,and vasoconstriction and the
2991.3,inflammatory response we'll talk about
2992.92,how to deal with hormone-based headaches
2995.14,a particular hormone was headaches that
2997.18,occur because of low estrogen and
2998.56,progesterone in a moment but the key
3001.02,thing to know is something that we
3002.579,covered in the fertility episode I did a
3005.04,very long very detailed episode on
3006.72,fertility so I'm not going going to go
3008.46,into this in significant detail now you
3010.8,can refer to that episode for probably
3013.38,more detail than you ever wanted but
3014.94,also a lot of tools as it relates to
3016.319,fertility in both males and females but
3018.48,right now I'm just going to give you a
3019.68,course overview of that in about 60 to
3022.74,120 seconds so that you'll understand
3024.8,when hormonal headaches are most likely
3027.72,to take place keep in mind that hormonal
3030.599,headaches are most likely to take place
3032.04,when estrogen and progesterone are
3034.44,lowest
3035.46,so if you understand that during the
3037.8,follicular stage of the ovulatory slash
3041.339,menstrual cycle okay so menstrual cycle
3043.079,is about 28 days on average not in
3045.18,everyone but it's about 20 days on
3046.26,average and the first half of that
3047.54,estrogen starts creeping up up up up up
3050.04,up up up up up and as we learn in
3052.559,endocrinology estrogen primes
3054.3,progesterone so estrogen will then Peak
3056.339,and then start to fall
3058.4,pretty quickly right about the time that
3061.8,the egg ovulates an egg is released and
3065.52,will essentially be ready for
3067.319,fertilization if the egg is fertilized a
3070.2,whole bunch of other things happen as it
3071.94,relates to pregnancy if not what ends up
3074.339,happening is that during the ludial
3076.98,phase which is the second half of the
3078.42,menstrual cycle there's been a buildup
3080.22,of the lining of the uterus
3082.44,because of an increase in progesterone
3084.3,so estrogen goes up during the
3085.559,follicular phase then it goes down and
3088.26,then progesterone goes up up up up up
3090.24,which is important for generating that
3093.18,thick lining of the uterus to allow the
3096.0,fertilized egg if it's fertilized to
3097.8,implant and if it's not fertilized all
3099.66,of that gets released from the body in
3101.28,this bleeding process that we call
3102.9,menstruation if menstruation occurs and
3105.119,day one of the menstrual cycle is
3106.38,considered the first day in which
3107.339,bleeding occurs well then what that
3108.96,means is that estrogen is already low
3110.94,because remember estrogen was low at the
3113.46,start of the follicular phase and went
3114.66,up up up up up up then it comes down
3116.46,right at the time of ovulation and
3118.319,progesterone goes up up up up up during
3121.92,the luteal phase in fact it's more than
3123.78,a thousand fold increase in progesterone
3125.46,but if there's no fertilization of the
3127.44,egg progesterone starts coming down down
3129.42,down down down what does that mean that
3131.04,means that on the first to about the
3133.559,fourth or fifth day of the menstrual
3134.94,cycle first being the first day of
3136.44,bleeding until about the fourth or fifth
3139.02,day of the menstrual cycle both estrogen
3141.24,and progesterone are very very low and
3143.94,it is at that time at the very beginning
3146.28,of the menstrual cycle so about the
3148.02,first week of the menstrual cycle that
3149.7,many women are very prone to hormonal
3151.8,headaches hormonal headaches not because
3153.96,estrogens High that's a common
3155.4,misconception rather because estrogen
3157.92,and progesterone are both low and now
3160.74,that you understand the Contour or the
3163.079,under underlying reasons for hormonal
3165.18,headache
3166.68,you can start to ask well what happens
3168.599,when estrogen is low well estrogen has a
3171.3,strong impact on the vasodilation
3173.04,vasoconstriction system as does
3174.72,progesterone we'll talk about that a
3176.339,little bit later but now that you know
3177.66,what hormonal headache is at least this
3179.579,one particular type of hormonal headache
3181.14,which is very very common given the
3183.059,number of women that are menstruating
3185.16,and the fact that low estrogen low
3186.96,progesterone is the cause of the
3189.54,hormonal headache and the fact that of
3192.3,course there are women who are no longer
3193.619,menstruating so they're either in
3195.0,perimenopause and menstruation is
3196.44,becoming more infrequent or they're in
3197.88,menopause and it deceased entirely well
3200.7,now you understand what the origin of
3202.8,the hormonal headache is and so all we
3204.96,need to know is what do estrogen and
3206.52,progesterone normally do in order to
3208.14,prevent headache and thereby you'll know
3210.9,exactly how to offset that is prevent or
3214.559,treat hormonal headache in that first
3216.54,week of the menstrual period the last
3218.22,type of headache that I'd like to
3219.3,discuss is headache associated with head
3221.88,hits that is traumatic brain injury
3223.859,although I definitely want to underscore
3225.96,the fact that even people who do not
3228.359,have traumatic brain injury can
3230.76,experience headaches as the consequence
3232.26,of hitting their head so the line
3234.54,between traumatic brain injury and lower
3236.94,level brain injury is one that still
3239.22,seeks definition in fact this is one of
3241.02,the major goals of the clinical field as
3244.079,it relates to concussion you know it's
3245.88,also what comes up a lot during the
3247.44,discussion about football you know these
3249.359,days you'll see players hit really hard
3251.28,and depending on whether or not they're
3253.2,laying there for five seconds 30 seconds
3255.599,or three minutes you know the crowd and
3258.0,the uh the people watching on television
3260.099,and everywhere else are all speculating
3261.66,as to whether or not the person should
3262.92,be allowed to play and to be quite
3264.66,direct there really is no way to assess
3267.24,the extent of brain damage after the
3269.22,consequence of hitting one's head or
3270.9,having one's head hit
3272.52,because
3274.02,first of all almost all of the best ways
3276.72,to detect traumatic brain injury except
3278.819,the most severe ones
3280.559,tend to require a lot of very large
3282.48,equipment like MRI and functional MRI
3284.88,and CT scans none of which are available
3287.28,on the side of the field or in the
3289.38,locker room but also because many many
3292.92,if not most of the effects of traumatic
3295.319,brain injury are going to occur not in
3297.78,the immediate minutes or even hours
3299.22,after the injury but several hours days
3301.98,or even weeks after that injury this is
3304.5,a discussion that we should hold off for
3306.72,a longer full episode on traumatic brain
3309.059,injury keeping in mind of course that
3310.98,football is this very Salient example
3313.619,of traumatic brain injury and concussion
3315.48,as is boxing as is even soccer with
3317.76,heading of the ball Believe It or Not
3318.9,repeated low level impact to the
3321.72,forehead and other parts of the head can
3324.119,give rise to over time traumatic brain
3326.4,injury without the need for any kind of
3328.319,full-blown concussion or being quote
3329.64,unquote knocked out but sports related
3332.64,concussion actually occupies just a tiny
3335.4,fraction of the majority of traumatic
3337.38,brain injury and concussion
3339.24,most traumatic brain injury and
3341.28,concussion and low-level brain injury
3343.14,that can accumulate over time to become
3345.059,traumatic for sake of daily living that
3347.579,is lowered cognition disruption and mood
3349.8,sleep Etc
3351.18,is actually the consequence of things
3353.04,other than Sports so for instance
3354.54,bicycle accidents playground accidents
3357.119,construction accidents and this is often
3359.819,forgotten for some reason all the sports
3361.92,in particular football tend to grab all
3364.38,the attention as it relates to
3365.52,concussion keep in mind that while for
3368.819,certain people is a path to a living for
3372.18,most people traumatic brain injury is
3374.52,going to occur in a car accident
3375.66,construction work or other types of work
3377.52,for which people generally don't have
3380.339,many options in terms of the type of
3381.839,work that they're doing so they are
3383.16,prone to concussions and head injuries
3384.9,simply by virtue of their work without
3387.24,any you know millions of dollars
3388.619,contracts or the opportunities
3390.359,necessarily some cases they do but
3392.579,necessarily to do other things and
3393.78,certainly car accidents or bike bicycle
3395.579,accidents are not voluntary events so
3398.88,the point being traumatic brain injury
3400.92,and headache related traumatic brain
3403.26,injury extends far beyond the realm of
3405.24,sports and in fact if you were to look
3406.68,at the numbers what you find is that
3408.0,more than 90 percent of traumatic brain
3409.74,injury so people coming into the
3411.3,hospital or clinic are people claiming
3413.16,that they've got consistent headaches
3414.66,they're not sleeping well their mood is
3416.7,off they're feeling more irritable after
3418.26,having hit their head even once
3420.599,is not the consequence of sports it's
3422.22,going to be the consequence of accidents
3423.839,either on at the workplace or in terms
3427.44,of a bicycle or other sorts of
3428.64,Transportation based accident like a car
3430.5,accident with that in mind any kind of
3433.319,head hit certainly involves a concussion
3436.079,or traumatic brain injury often leads to
3439.079,headaches either infrequent but severe
3442.079,headaches or chronic low-level headaches
3444.18,or a feeling there's kind of a
3445.2,stuffiness or a fullness to the head
3446.64,there can be a lot of different Origins
3448.5,to that
3449.579,a common origin is going to be actual
3451.8,swelling of the not necessarily the
3453.78,brain tissue directly but if you recall
3455.819,our discussion about the meninges which
3457.38,include the dura and the other tissues
3459.9,that surround the brain they're actually
3460.92,three layers that we call the meninges
3462.839,the durages being one of them and
3464.52,there's a very little space between
3465.96,those the brain the meninges that
3467.819,surround it and the skull it's called
3469.26,the subarachnoid space very cool right
3471.18,arachnoid like spider
3472.859,well if there's even a slight bit of
3475.079,swelling in the brain or even distant
3477.18,brain tissue so for instance even if the
3478.98,there's Whiplash so there's swelling of
3481.02,the tissue muscular tissue and neural
3483.3,tissue in the neck area that can
3485.76,constrict the flow of things like
3487.26,cerebral spinal fluid blood flow and
3489.66,indeed mucus and other other things that
3491.4,are essential we all hear mucus and we
3493.38,think Illness but mucus is a vital vital
3496.94,substance within the body for a lot of
3499.2,important reasons in health as well as
3501.9,in sickness well if there's less of that
3503.94,liquid and other fluids and mucus being
3506.52,delivered to that space well then it can
3508.619,clog up so sort of the plumbing is
3510.359,clogged up or that it's caught at the
3513.66,level of the site of hit or injury
3515.76,because there's some local swelling and
3517.38,inflammation there so there are many
3518.579,different mechanisms that can underlie
3520.079,headache associated with head hits or
3522.18,traumatic brain injury now fortunately
3523.92,there are some recent data pointing to
3526.44,some what I would call non-obvious
3528.599,treatments for headache in traumatic
3531.119,brain injury keeping in mind that
3534.119,anytime we're talking about injury or
3537.119,disease or health for that matter mental
3539.64,health or physical health we have to
3541.5,highlight
3542.76,a fact that's going to come up again and
3544.619,again in every single episode of this
3547.079,podcast and I think it's not being
3550.14,overly redundant to do so which is that
3553.14,regular
3554.76,sufficient amounts of deep sleep each
3556.92,night are going to be important for all
3559.02,aspects of mental health physical health
3560.339,and performance and have been shown over
3562.619,and over again to reduce the frequency
3564.42,of headache and to reduce the time to
3566.819,repair after traumatic brain injury and
3569.099,can improve cognition and on and on and
3570.839,on so sleep is essential for all the
3572.94,normal things that encourage healthy
3575.099,activity of the different tissues that
3576.599,are involved in brain and body to occur
3579.599,so sleep deprivation of course is going
3581.22,to limit those but I do want to point
3582.72,out that sleep
3584.7,sunlight and I've talked about this
3586.68,almost ad nauseam on this podcast but
3589.2,regular circadian Cycles getting
3590.76,sunlight in your eyes early in the day
3592.2,and in the evening as well and as much
3593.88,as possible throughout the day without
3595.079,burning your skin and limiting your
3596.7,exposure to artificial lights at night
3598.799,and on and on all of which is covered in
3600.66,the light for health episode of The
3601.799,huberman Lab podcast the master sleep
3603.42,episode The huberman Lab podcast and in
3606.0,the perfect your sleep episode The
3607.92,huberman Lab podcast you can find all
3609.42,that at hubermanlab.com getting light
3612.0,and avoiding light at the proper times
3613.619,of the 24 hour cycle is also going to
3615.599,favor all the pathways ranging from gut
3618.0,brain access to the inflammatory
3619.76,anti-inflammatory Pathways neural
3621.78,Pathways Etc that of course if you do
3624.359,that you're going to improve and offset
3626.94,any kind of detriment caused by
3628.92,traumatic brain injury is it treating
3630.66,traumatic brain injury directly no but
3633.119,is not getting sufficient sleep not
3634.74,getting sunlight at the right times of
3636.119,day and getting too much artificial
3637.319,light at night going to make any impact
3639.78,of traumatic brain injury including
3641.22,headache far worse yes there are
3643.02,certainly a ton of data to support that
3644.46,state statement as well and then of
3646.02,course nutrition and exercise are also
3647.64,important so we can list out sleep Sun
3651.0,proper nutrition exercise and I would
3653.28,put a proper social connection whatever
3655.2,that means to you healthy social
3656.579,connections include romantic
3659.339,friendship familial and relationship to
3662.04,self those five things sleep exercise
3664.2,Sun nutrition and social connection are
3666.42,all critical for maintaining baselines
3668.52,of health and raising your baselines of
3669.96,health and I mentioned that I can
3671.819,segment this out now because I think
3673.859,that anytime we're about to start
3675.299,discussing pointed treatments that is
3678.119,things that you can take or do to reduce
3680.7,headache or things that you can take or
3682.44,do to improve anything within mental
3684.78,health physical health and performance
3685.92,we have to remember that the foundation
3687.48,of mental health physical health and
3688.74,performance is only set at its highest
3690.54,level by tending to those other things
3692.28,and that nothing really surpasses any of
3694.38,those things or put differently there's
3696.839,no replacement for any of those things
3698.4,in the form of a pill a powder even a
3701.04,behavioral practice there are things you
3702.24,can do to offset getting less than ideal
3705.0,sleep the things that you can use like
3707.04,bright artificial lights during the day
3708.54,to try and partially offset lack of
3710.4,sunlight but really there is no exercise
3712.74,pill there is no sunlight device
3715.619,although some bright lights are very
3717.42,bright there's no no replace basement
3719.579,for actual sunlight there's no
3720.96,replacement for actual sleep there's no
3722.339,replacement for actual nutrition and I
3723.9,do feel it's an important conversation
3725.22,to have as we head into the next segment
3727.02,which is what can you take or do to
3730.559,reduce headache and in order to address
3732.119,this we're going to start first with the
3733.92,headaches associated with head hits and
3735.599,traumatic brain injury because turns out
3738.359,there's a surprising and very useful
3740.7,approach to doing that but
3743.7,this same approach also can help offset
3746.64,and treat headache in other conditions
3748.74,as well meaning not just for headaches
3750.599,caused by traumatic brain injury but
3751.98,also headaches caused by sudden onset
3755.099,Tension Headache or migraine headache or
3757.2,even perhaps again perhaps cluster type
3759.9,headaches so the first substance that
3761.579,I'd like to highlight that has been
3763.38,shown to significantly reduce the
3765.72,intensity and or frequency of headaches
3768.2,is creatine now creatine as many of you
3771.9,know is something that people supplement
3774.059,and take
3776.04,most often creatine is discussed in the
3778.68,context of muscle performance not just
3780.18,for people who weightlift but for people
3781.5,who do endurance exercise and it's often
3783.96,been said that 5 to 10 grams per day of
3786.42,creatine monohydrate depending on how
3787.859,much you weigh 5 to 10 grams per day of
3789.42,creatine monohydrate can increase
3791.099,creatine phosphate stores in muscles can
3793.98,bring more water into muscles can make
3795.48,you stronger get increased power output
3796.98,and that is all true that is all
3799.14,completely true we discussed this in the
3800.579,huberman lab podcast with Dr Andy Galpin
3802.98,when he was a guest on the Hebrew and
3805.38,Lab podcast or standard series and we
3808.02,discussed this extensively in an
3809.46,upcoming episode from Dr Andy Galpin in
3812.52,his special
3814.02,six-part guest Series where he is a
3816.9,guest on the Hebrew Lab podcast but
3818.28,where really he's the one doing the
3819.599,majority of the teaching that series
3821.339,covers everything from strength
3822.54,hypertrophy endurance and there's an
3824.04,episode on supplementation where we go
3825.72,deep into the discussion about creatine
3827.339,now in that discussion and again now
3830.099,we highlight the fact that creatine
3832.559,While most often discussed online and in
3835.559,the media as a supplement for sports
3837.66,performance for the reasons I just
3839.28,mentioned
3840.18,actually has far more data behind it
3842.819,that is laboratory studies exploring the
3844.92,role of creatine in the clinical setting
3847.2,so I'd like to highlight a paper from
3848.52,that literature now that will make very
3849.96,clear as to why creatine is interesting
3852.059,and in fact very effective for treating
3854.28,headache and particular headache caused
3855.72,by head hits or traumatic brain injury
3857.339,the title of the paper is prevention of
3859.74,traumatic headache dizziness and fatigue
3861.9,with creatine Administration now keep in
3863.88,mind this is a pilot study it was
3866.04,performed in humans so when you hear the
3867.839,words pre-clinical that is if you hear
3869.46,there was a pre-clinical study on blank
3871.319,that means almost always that the study
3873.54,was performed on animal models mice rats
3875.94,primates Etc
3877.5,a clinical trial is something that's
3879.119,carried out on humans and a pilot study
3881.579,means that the study was carried out on
3883.619,humans but on a fairly small cohort a
3886.079,very fairly small group uh or limited
3888.78,number of subjects nonetheless if the
3890.4,data are robust as it is in this case of
3892.799,this paper I think it's worth paying
3894.18,attention to so in this study what they
3896.04,looked at was creatine Administration so
3898.2,what they did is they had people ingest
3899.76,a certain amount of creatine I'll tell
3901.619,you in a moment
3902.7,in fluid so it could be taken in water
3904.44,milk with or without food doesn't really
3906.299,matter what time of day
3907.68,they had people take creatine why would
3909.9,they have people take creatine after
3911.099,traumatic brain injury and in particular
3913.98,for people that are suffering from
3915.18,headache dizziness fatigue Etc the
3918.0,reason is that
3919.5,neurons nerve cells rely very heavily on
3922.5,the regulation of calcium in order to
3925.319,generate those Action potentials to
3926.7,communicate with one another so it
3928.02,doesn't matter if it's a motor neuron a
3929.22,sensory neuron or a modulatory neuron
3930.78,they all generate Action potentials or
3932.28,something similar to it and calcium is
3934.619,important for that process calcium
3936.299,becomes dysregulated after traumatic
3939.299,brain injury in a number of different
3940.619,ways
3941.94,in particular in ways that impact the
3944.339,energy production systems of cells that
3946.619,are related to ATP adenosine
3948.18,triphosphate for those facionados out
3950.4,there that want to look it up you can
3951.359,simply look up calcium ATP and neurons
3953.339,and you can learn about that cycle
3955.559,creatine
3957.0,can be stored in muscles as we talked
3958.68,about before but creatine and in
3960.24,particular the phosphorylated form of
3962.099,creatine which is the readily available
3964.819,fuel source
3967.079,form of creatine can also be stored in
3969.72,brain tissue and is actually quite
3971.579,prominently stored in the forebrain the
3973.38,area where the real estate of of your
3975.18,brain just behind the forehead which is
3976.619,involved in planning and action and
3978.96,understanding context so it's very
3980.4,important for cognition
3981.96,it's important for personality too but
3984.059,it's important for a number of different
3985.079,aspects of life that have to do with
3986.64,making plans being able to focus very
3988.68,intensely on your work etc or on
3990.9,anything for that matter all functions
3993.24,that become heavily disrupted in people
3994.98,who have traumatic brain injury and
3996.42,concussion
3998.24,creatine's ability to communicate with
4000.92,the calcium in the ATP system was the
4003.38,motivation behind the study that is the
4004.94,authors hypothesize on the basis of
4006.559,pre-clinical data in animals
4009.079,that by increasing creatine stores
4011.539,within the brain not just in the muscle
4013.339,but in particular within the brain
4015.92,that
4017.24,the availability of creatine would allow
4019.28,for better cognitive function in general
4021.38,now they didn't look at cognition
4022.76,specifically in this paper but they did
4024.68,look at the other aspects that is that
4026.539,the bad stuff associated with TBI and
4029.24,they had people supplement with creatine
4030.799,at a level that is much higher than the
4033.74,typical level that people supplement
4035.059,with creatine Simply for Sports
4037.099,Performance so as I mentioned before
4038.72,most people if they supplement with
4040.7,creatine for sports performance they
4042.2,take creatine monohydrate
4044.299,typically five grams per day sometimes
4046.4,10 grams per day if they're about 100
4048.079,kilograms or or greater in body weight
4050.66,100 kilograms is 200 approximately 220.
4053.96,pounds so the dosage that was used for
4056.96,supplementing creatine in this study
4059.359,to address the potential impact of
4061.94,creatine on headache dizziness and
4064.039,fatigue was quite a bit higher than the
4067.46,dosages used simply for muscle
4068.9,performance in this study they had
4070.7,people take a dose of 0.4 grams of
4074.839,creatine monohydrate per kilogram of
4077.78,body weight so for somebody that weighs
4079.28,100 kilograms or 220 pounds that would
4081.559,be 40 grams of creatine per day if
4085.22,someone weighs half that much they would
4086.839,take 20 grams of creatine per day and
4089.24,they did that over a period of six
4090.68,months and we know that when you take
4092.42,creatine over and over day to day that
4094.64,there's a buildup of creatine stores
4096.02,both in the muscles and within the brain
4097.88,tissue now what they found as a
4099.679,consequence of this creatine
4100.64,Administration was really striking and I
4102.56,think quite exciting they found a very
4105.259,significant decrease in the frequency of
4107.96,headache in people that were
4109.52,supplementing with creatine as opposed
4111.319,to the controls now keep in mind that
4113.179,this is a pilot study but the effects
4115.219,are very dramatic they found a very
4118.04,statistically significant decrease
4119.299,increase in the frequency of headache in
4122.06,people that were taking creatine in fact
4123.92,if you look at the controls and you see
4125.719,that they're basically getting headache
4127.46,at a frequency of 90 percent or more
4130.04,after TBI the reduction in headache
4132.44,frequency is down to about 10 or 12
4135.02,percent in the people taking creatine so
4137.299,that's quite quite a dramatic effect and
4139.04,if you look at the other measures they
4140.42,took
4141.38,keep in mind again this is a pilot study
4143.6,so a limited number of subjects but
4145.819,again the results are very impressive
4147.62,what they found is that the number of
4150.62,people experiencing dizziness was
4152.719,significantly reduced in people
4154.16,supplementing with creatine as was the
4156.259,number of people experiencing fatigue
4158.06,and acute fatigue and chronic fatigue
4160.4,again not chronic fatigue syndrome per
4162.319,se but chronic fatigue which was in this
4165.199,study defined as a general sense of
4166.699,bodily weakness and even mental weakness
4169.46,mental weakness is a little bit hard to
4171.199,quantify but they were very careful to
4173.96,distinguish between cognitive and mental
4175.88,fatigue versus physical and somatic
4177.62,fatigue they acknowledge that both of
4179.779,those occur in TBI or post-tbi the
4182.779,headache is quite frequent basically the
4184.819,takeaway of the study is that for people
4186.62,experiencing headache dizziness and
4188.359,fatigue
4189.38,due to TBI and perhaps and I want to
4191.9,underline perhaps because it hasn't
4193.16,really been explored yet but perhaps
4194.78,headache dizziness and fatigue due to
4197.66,other conditions symptoms
4200.12,or causes of headache creatine
4202.64,monohydrate supplementation might be
4205.16,again might be an excellent candidate
4207.38,for people to try why do we say that
4208.82,well first of all creatine monohydrate
4211.28,is relatively inexpensive it's
4213.14,considered safe at the dosages used in
4215.719,this study and certainly for sports
4218.36,performance as well and
4221.12,there are very few other compounds that
4224.179,have been shown to have as significant
4225.98,an impact on headache over the long term
4228.92,as has creatine monohydrate in these
4231.56,studies of people with TBI it's also
4233.84,important to highlight the fact that
4235.64,many many people suffer from tbis I
4237.98,mentioned earlier and as now there are
4240.38,very few treatments for TBI you tend to
4243.86,get the basic advice coming back and
4245.6,again I think it's excellent advice you
4247.28,know get proper amounts of sleep get
4249.08,exercise but don't get another traumatic
4250.82,brain injury that's obvious but you'd be
4253.58,surprised how many people go right back
4254.84,to work because they have to and you
4257.179,know we have to be sympathetic to the
4258.98,fact that many people just can't stop
4260.54,working or go on disability
4262.52,so many people have to go back to work
4263.96,that could be sport or it could be other
4265.58,kind of work where they are then subject
4267.5,to perhaps getting more TBI maybe
4269.96,they're getting less rest as a
4271.1,consequence and stress obviously stress
4272.9,is a confounding issue for TBI but sleep
4276.26,exercise Sun nutrition
4278.719,all of those things proper social
4280.219,connection are what people are
4281.9,encouraged to do when they have TBI but
4284.06,there have been very few compounds in
4285.38,particular very few over-the-counter
4287.06,compounds that are known to be safe that
4289.46,have shown efficacy in dealing with TBI
4291.56,so I think that while this is a pilot
4294.02,study and we can consider it preliminary
4296.48,I think it's important enough and the
4298.52,effects were dramatic enough that people
4300.62,with headache and in particular people
4302.179,with TBI ought to consider supplementing
4304.88,with creatine in order to deal with
4306.679,their headaches and of course I eagerly
4308.36,await other studies exploring the role
4311.54,of this high dosage of creatine which is
4313.76,a relatively high dosage of creatine
4315.26,monohydrate for offsetting headache
4317.06,meanwhile I think there are a number of
4318.32,people out there
4319.46,suffering from headache who might
4322.34,consider using creatine monohydrate in
4324.5,an exploratory fashion and seeing
4326.3,whether or not it helps offset their
4327.8,headaches keep in mind of course anytime
4329.42,you're going to add or remove anything
4330.88,supplement or otherwise from your from
4333.38,your treatment your nutrition Etc I do
4335.239,suggest that you consult with your
4336.62,physician in particular if you have
4337.94,chronic headaches I don't say that to
4339.62,protect me I say that of course to
4341.12,protect you I'd like to take a brief
4343.28,break and thank our sponsor inside
4345.62,tracker inside tracker is a personalized
4348.38,nutrition platform that analyzes data
4350.3,from your blood and DNA to help you
4352.28,better understand your body and help you
4353.96,reach your health goals I've long been a
4356.12,believer in getting regular blood work
4357.5,done for the simple reason that many of
4359.9,the factors that impact your immediate
4361.46,and long-term Health can only be
4363.199,analyzed from a quality blood test the
4365.179,problem with a lot of blood and DNA
4366.56,tests out there however is that you get
4368.48,data back about metabolic factors lipids
4371.239,and hormones and so forth but you don't
4372.5,know what to do with those data inside
4374.12,tracker solves that problem and makes it
4376.34,very easy for you to understand what
4378.38,sorts of nutritional
4379.9,behavioral maybe even supplementation
4382.34,based interventions you might want to
4384.62,take on in order to adjust the numbers
4386.3,of those metabolic factors hormones
4388.1,lipids and other things that impact your
4390.02,immediate and long-term Health to bring
4391.88,those numbers into the ranges that are
4393.98,appropriate and indeed optimal for you
4395.719,inside tracker's ultimate plan also now
4398.6,includes a measure of April lipoprotein
4400.64,b apolipoprotein b sometimes also called
4403.4,APO B has emerged in recent years as
4407.36,among the most important measures to
4409.64,evaluate your overall levels of
4411.26,cardiovascular health and health overall
4413.6,and that's because apolipoprotein B
4416.0,levels are predictive of cardiovascular
4418.76,function disease and things that
4421.219,cardiovascular function and disease can
4423.08,impinge on including brain Health and

4428.78,huberman and get 20 off any of inside
4431.42,tracker's plans that's inside
4432.92,tracker.com huberman to get 20 off what
4436.58,I'd like to discuss next I find
4438.56,extremely exciting why well what I'm
4441.8,about to describe is a compound or I
4443.719,should say a set of compounds that are
4445.88,available over the counter that have
4448.1,been shown to be very effective in
4450.26,reducing the frequency and intensity of
4452.239,headaches and not just one kind of
4453.56,headache but multiple types of headaches
4455.239,so what I'll describe has been shown to
4457.58,have significant effects in reducing the
4459.92,intensity or frequency of tension type
4462.56,headaches migraine type headaches as
4465.14,well as hormone type headaches that are
4466.94,related to the menstrual cycles that I
4468.62,described earlier now there are a lot of
4470.36,data centered around this General topic
4472.82,but I'm going to focus on three main
4474.44,papers but I haven't told you yet of
4476.719,course is what is the compound that I'm
4478.46,referring to what is this
4479.3,over-the-counter compound well it turns
4481.34,out this over-the-counter compound is
4483.44,not just available over the counter it's
4485.0,also available in food so it turns out
4487.46,that nutrition can have a very strong
4489.38,impact on the frequency and intensity of
4491.54,headache although supplementation with
4493.64,this particular compound can accomplish
4495.5,the same thing as well what I'm
4497.12,referring to here are omega-3 fatty
4499.52,acids many of you are probably familiar
4501.44,with omega-3 fatty acids these are fatty
4504.26,acids that come in the form of so-called
4505.76,EPA and DHA and omega-3 fatty acids are
4509.3,commonly distinguished from the
4511.219,so-called omega-6 fatty acids omega-6
4513.98,fatty acids come in a bunch of different
4516.199,foods and they of course can be
4518.06,supplemented as well omega-3 fatty acids
4520.04,come in a bunch of different foods and
4521.239,can be supplemented as well Common forms
4523.28,of omega-3 fatty acids or I should say
4525.38,common sources of omega-3 fatty acids in
4528.08,Foods include fatty ocean fish including
4531.26,salmon salmon skins sardines anchovies
4534.02,things of that sort
4535.58,common sources in supplement form are
4538.28,so-called fish oil
4539.78,capsules or liquid fish oil again
4542.48,omega-3 fatty acids and almost always
4545.12,when we're talking about omega-3 fatty
4546.8,acids we're talking about a combination
4548.36,of EPA and DHA but really it is the
4552.08,quantity of EPA
4554.659,omega-3 fatty acids that seems to be the
4556.4,most impactful for the sorts of Health
4558.32,metrics that we're going to talk about
4559.46,in a few minutes
4560.96,now with respect to omega-6 fatty acids
4564.02,the most typical food sources of omega-6
4566.48,fatty acids are seed oils I know
4568.64,nowadays seed oils have become quite
4570.679,controversial
4571.88,I've given my stance on this in a prior
4574.4,podcast but I'll just repeat it for
4575.78,those of you that haven't heard it I am
4577.52,not of the belief that all seed oils are
4579.86,bad that they're all inflammatory that
4582.38,they are killing us or making us sick
4584.179,that they are the major cause of
4585.739,metabolic dysfunction Etc however I
4588.14,think it is very clear and I learned
4589.4,this from Dr Lane Norton when he was a
4591.08,guest on this podcast and taught us all
4592.46,about nutrition in great depth I highly
4595.699,recommend that episode if you're
4596.719,interested in nutrition that people are
4599.3,consuming a lot more oil generally and a
4601.82,lot of those oils that people are
4603.26,consuming more of nowadays include a lot
4606.26,of the so-called omega-6 fatty acids and
4609.26,a lot of those oils are seed oils the
4611.239,particular omega-6 fatty acid that's
4612.98,going to be relevant for today's
4614.06,discussion is linoleic acid and that is
4616.82,common in a lot of seed oils so again
4619.1,I'm not going to tell you that seed oils
4621.44,are bad however it does seem to be the
4623.36,case that many people are consuming far
4625.82,too many seed oils and in doing so are
4628.159,consuming far too many calories and
4629.78,perhaps are consuming too much of the
4631.64,Omega six fatty acids relative to the
4634.699,omega-3 fatty acids now with that said I
4637.159,think there is General agreement among
4639.4,nutritionists and health professionals
4641.48,that we could all stand to get more
4644.36,omega-3 fatty acids perhaps for
4646.34,cardiovascular health although that's a
4647.84,little bit debated but certainly for
4649.699,immune system function
4651.38,for mood and for functioning of the
4653.0,brain and for the potent
4655.6,anti-inflammatory effects of Omega-3 so
4657.8,again Omega-3s can be sourced from food
4659.719,both animal based and plant-based you
4661.88,can simply go online and look up the
4663.5,various food-based sources but
4666.56,in thinking about headache and different
4668.36,treatments for headache there are some
4669.62,recent studies exploring how
4671.12,supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids
4673.219,and in one case how supplementing with
4675.44,omega-3 fatty acids and deliberately
4677.36,reducing the amount of linoleic acid the
4680.179,omega-6 fatty acids how that can impact
4682.52,headache so the first study I'd like to
4684.44,describe in reference to the role of
4685.94,omega-3 fatty acids and headache was
4688.1,published in 2018 and the title of the
4690.5,paper is long chain omega-3 fatty acids
4692.9,and headache in the U.S population there
4694.88,are a number of things that I really
4695.78,like about this study a few of those
4697.82,include the fact that they looked at an
4699.679,enormous number of people that is they
4702.5,included 12 317 men and women I like the
4705.98,fact that they included men and women in
4707.42,the study age 20 or older and that they
4710.06,broke down the population into
4712.239,categories that included age they
4715.159,certainly looked at race and ethnicity
4717.14,they looked at educational background
4719.0,they looked at body mass total energy
4721.219,intake which is really important if you
4722.96,think about it people are going to be
4724.28,eating and within the thing things that
4727.1,they eat they're going to be consuming
4728.239,some Omega-3s hopefully as well some
4731.06,omega-6s and if they're eating far more
4732.98,then they're going to get far more of
4735.32,likely going to get far more of both of
4737.12,those things than they would ordinarily
4738.56,if they were eating smaller amounts so
4740.06,they controlled for total caloric intake
4742.04,in a way that I find
4744.04,particularly useful for looking at these
4746.42,kind of data so the reason they explored
4748.46,Omega-3s is worth mentioning omega-3
4750.44,fatty acids are known to have an
4752.199,anti-inflammatory effect that
4755.06,anti-inflammatory effect is mediated
4756.8,through a couple of different Pathways
4758.12,we won't go into these in too much
4759.44,detail now but the omega-3 fatty acids
4761.84,keep in mind actually make up various
4764.96,parts of cells in the brain and body
4766.88,that's right the membrane that remember
4769.34,I talked before about how steroid
4770.78,hormones can go through the different
4771.8,membranes of the cells the outer
4773.12,membrane and the inner membrane a lot of
4774.92,those actual membranes the structural
4776.9,constituents of neurons and other cells
4779.48,are actually made up of or include
4781.4,certain fatty acid long-chain fatty
4783.86,acids and the omega-3 fatty acids are
4785.96,important for or the actual construction
4788.06,of those tissues as well as having
4790.3,anti-inflammatory effects through things
4792.02,like limiting prostaglandins and other
4793.88,things that can cause inflammation okay
4795.5,so there are a bunch of different ways
4796.64,that omega-3 fatty acids can be useful
4798.5,they refer in this study to an earlier
4801.32,study that looked at the so-called
4803.0,analgesic effect the pain relieving
4805.04,effect analgesic means pain relieving
4806.84,effect of omega-3 fatty acids in what
4810.62,had been a randomized controlled trial
4812.659,and in that previous paper what they
4814.64,found was that diets high in Omega-3s
4817.699,and low in omega-6s okay so high three
4820.58,low six and as compared to diets that
4824.42,were just reduced omega-6s they found a
4828.199,greater analgesic effect of increasing
4830.3,Omega-3s while also reducing omega-6
4832.4,fatty acids so in the context of the
4834.38,seed oil discussion although keeping in
4836.0,mind that omega-6s can come from other
4837.739,sources as well if omega-6s were just
4840.32,reduced on their own there wasn't as
4843.14,great in effect in terms of reducing
4845.06,pain and inflammation as there was when
4847.76,omega-3 fatty acids were deliberately
4849.38,increased and omega-6 fatty acids were
4851.84,reduced again in all of these studies
4854.42,because these are the ones in which they
4856.58,controlled things well as we should as
4858.92,we say they are holding constant the
4861.56,caloric intake so it's not just that
4862.88,you're removing fat eating less fat
4864.44,there's actually a removal of certain
4866.06,fats and fatty acids and a replacement
4868.04,of those with omega-3 fatty acids in one
4870.86,case in the other case it's just a
4872.54,reduction in omega-6s and you're using
4874.58,other food types and macronutrients to
4876.98,offset that that reduction in calories
4878.84,caused by reducing omega-6s the basic
4881.42,takeaway that they're relying on
4882.98,marching into the study is that
4884.54,increasing Omega-3s and reducing
4886.64,omega-6s seems to be beneficial for
4888.44,reducing pain and indeed in this study
4890.659,they find something quite similar which
4892.88,is that when you hold caloric intake
4895.46,constant and when you look at omega-6s
4898.4,whether or not you decrease omega-6
4899.9,fatty acids or not you find is that
4902.6,increasing omega-3 fatty acids
4905.42,in the diet so either consumed through
4908.36,food sources or by supplementation was
4910.64,associated with a lower prevalence of
4912.5,severe headache or migraine so severe
4914.84,tension type headache or migraine so
4917.179,this is promising and points to the fact
4919.159,that long chain omega-3 fatty acids are
4921.739,likely to have either a pain reducing
4924.44,and there's evidence for that and or an
4927.86,inflammation reducing effect that can
4929.78,significantly reduce the severity of
4931.88,headache in both tension type headache
4933.739,and in migraine so that's the first
4935.719,study the second study is a more recent
4938.6,study it was published in 2021 that used
4941.659,a I would say a more or less similar
4944.239,type of overall design is the one I'd
4945.86,refer to earlier the title of this paper
4948.02,is dietary alteration of what they call
4950.659,N3 but those are omega-3 and n6 omega-6
4953.9,sorry for this shift in nomenclature I
4955.76,didn't write the paper
4957.02,dietary alteration of
4960.02,omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for
4962.3,headache reductions in adults with
4963.86,migraine and this was a randomized
4965.42,control trial randomized control trials
4967.82,involve having people be in one
4969.08,condition where they do one thing and
4970.94,then they get swapped randomly into
4972.56,another condition so they serve as their
4974.6,own internal control and that controls
4977.0,for all sorts of things like differences
4979.159,in sex differences in age differences in
4981.739,health background in any number of other
4983.54,variables as best as one can
4985.94,in this study they had people either
4987.679,ingest a diet that had increased
4991.52,Omega-3s so increased EPA and DHA or
4995.719,increased
4996.98,EPA and DHA and reduced amounts of
5000.04,linoleic acid okay so that's going to
5002.14,reduce omega-6s
5004.12,or a control diet in which they had
5007.6,people taking well it's essentially the
5009.46,average intake of Omega-3s and omega-6s
5011.92,and you can probably already guess what
5013.96,the general results of the study are
5015.34,going to be the general results were
5017.5,that there were reductions in headaches
5019.239,okay the really cool thing is it was a
5022.239,massive reduction in headache okay this
5023.86,was they refer to it as a robust
5025.719,reduction in headache in particular for
5028.9,the subjects that increase their
5030.58,Omega-3s and reduce the amount of
5032.199,linoleic acid that they took the other
5034.0,thing that I really like about this
5035.08,study is that while they don't know the
5037.06,exact underlying mechanism for the
5038.679,effect they did spend some time
5041.98,delineating what it is that the omega-3
5044.679,and omega-6 fatty acids are likely doing
5046.659,to either offset or exacerbate headache
5049.3,now I didn't say that omega-6 fatty
5051.04,acids exacerbate headache but it does
5053.26,seem that people who ingest more
5054.82,linoleic acid and omega-6 are
5057.159,experiencing more inflammation and that
5060.34,is evident in a bunch of different
5061.78,conditions one for instance is or
5063.88,increases in things like cgrp cgrp is a
5067.12,molecule that's associated with the
5068.56,calcium signaling pathway it's involved
5070.12,in vasodilation the expansion of the
5072.58,blood vessels and capillaries and that's
5074.44,known
5075.46,as I mentioned earlier to exacerbate
5077.92,certain forms of headache okay there are
5080.08,also forms of headache that can be
5081.219,caused by vasoconstriction we'll talk
5082.6,about one very dramatic example perhaps
5084.4,as we get toward the end it's a very
5086.199,uncommon example but um it's a it's
5088.659,called Thunderclap headache and trust me
5091.0,you do not want Thunderclap headache um
5093.34,and so we'll talk about Thunderclap
5094.42,headache a little bit later that
5095.26,involves constriction of the blood
5096.4,vessels in any case
5098.739,in this paper they they didn't study
5101.62,mechanism directly but they're resting
5103.84,on this known analgesic anti-pain as
5107.02,well as known anti-inflammatory Pathways
5109.179,related to increasing omega-3 intake and
5111.58,simultaneously resting on the idea where
5114.52,I think there's I think we now can say
5116.56,conclusion that omega-6 fatty acids in
5119.14,particular linoleic acid
5121.78,can increase inflammation by way of
5124.3,increasing things like cgrp vasodilation
5126.82,and some other Pathways related to the
5130.0,so-called inflammatory cytokine Pathways
5132.219,and there's a whole discussion nowadays
5134.26,of What's called the inflammatorium so
5136.06,the basic takeaway is that if you are
5138.699,interested in reducing headache it may
5141.28,be beneficial at least according to
5142.719,these two studies and another one I'll
5144.4,talk about in a moment to increase
5146.26,amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and that
5148.36,can be done again through the ingestions
5149.8,of foods although based on the dosages
5153.1,that we'll talk about in a moment
5155.14,increasing omega-3 fatty acids by taking
5157.36,liquid form fish oil which is perhaps
5159.159,the most cost effective way to
5161.38,supplement Omega-3s or capsules which is
5164.02,perhaps the most efficient way to
5165.699,supplement Omega-3s relate to a level of
5168.28,one gram or more of EPA per day again
5171.699,that's the EPA form in particular so if
5174.76,you're for instance taking supplemental
5176.32,fish oil or you're getting your Omega-3s
5178.12,from food and you're getting what you
5180.52,determine to be 2 000 milligrams or two
5183.4,grams per day of Omega-3s keep in mind
5186.1,that's going to include EPA ndha and it
5189.159,does seem that getting above one gram
5191.56,per day of EPA omega-3 fatty acids
5194.139,either through food or supplements or
5195.88,both is going to be the critical
5198.04,threshold for reductions in the
5200.139,frequency and intensity of headaches
5201.639,that include both tension headaches and
5203.62,migraine headaches now some people will
5205.84,find actually that ingesting far more
5208.96,omega-3 fatty acids generally through
5210.94,supplementation but again can be
5212.5,accomplished through Foods as well
5214.36,can also be beneficial for other things
5216.82,such as mood and indeed there's a whole
5218.62,literature related to effects of
5220.36,ingesting one to three grams again three
5223.96,grams per day of EPA so that's going to
5226.3,require
5227.26,quite a high intake of Omega-3s in
5229.659,whatever form or supplement you decide
5231.4,to take those into your body but that
5233.44,that can improve mood and so forth the
5235.96,basic range that I was able to find in
5238.179,the meta-analysis so meta-analyzes are
5240.159,where a researcher will look at the
5242.199,results of a bunch of different studies
5243.52,focused on the same thing look at the
5246.4,different strength of those studies
5247.48,they'll do all sorts of cool statistical
5249.76,gymnastics like remove the most potent
5252.4,study the one that had the greatest
5253.78,effect and see whether or not they're
5255.219,still an effect of some treatment or for
5257.92,instance they will swap in and out
5260.02,different studies and different
5261.58,combinations to see whether or not any
5263.56,one study is really leading to the
5265.12,conclusion that a given treatment does
5266.8,something in any case in the
5268.239,meta-analysis of omega-3 fatty acids for
5270.46,the treatment of headache and that
5271.42,includes all the different kinds of
5272.62,headache
5273.639,they found
5275.08,in exploring a huge range of Omega-3
5277.659,supplementation ranging from 200
5279.34,milligrams all the way up to 2 000
5281.199,milligrams per day it really was at the
5283.36,one gram or higher dosage per day where
5287.08,the significant impact on reducing
5289.12,headache frequency and intensity was
5290.92,found and just very briefly earlier I
5293.08,mentioned that not only is omega-3 fatty
5295.719,acids supplementation been shown to be
5297.159,effective in reducing the frequency and
5299.32,intensity of headache in tension type
5301.239,and migraine type headache but it's also
5303.699,been shown to improve outcomes for
5306.76,premenstrual syndrome related headaches
5309.04,these are what we refer to earlier as
5311.08,hormone-based headaches again
5313.6,the low estrogen low progesterone
5316.06,associated with certain phases of the
5318.04,menstrual cycle as well as other phase
5319.42,of the menstrual cycle are often
5321.04,associated with headache in uh study
5323.199,entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids
5325.78,on premenstrual syndrome a systematic
5327.58,review and again meta-analysis what they
5330.219,found and here I'm paraphrasing the
5331.659,conclusion was that
5333.699,omega-3 fatty acids could yes
5335.679,effectively reduce the severity of PMS
5338.56,symptoms and one of the symptoms in
5340.78,particular that they found what that was
5342.4,reduced was the pain related symptoms
5344.739,associated with headache and they
5346.84,actually had some very nice hypotheses
5348.28,as to why that likely would be and in
5351.88,fact point out that in earlier studies
5354.52,omega-3 fatty acids have actually been
5356.32,considered as non-steroidal
5358.179,anti-inflammatory drugs in some cases
5360.4,and indeed there are prescription forms
5363.1,of omega-3 fatty acids and I highlight
5365.26,that not because I think people need to
5366.639,run out and get the prescription form of
5368.62,omega-3 fatty acids they're actually
5369.94,quite hard to obtain and quite expensive
5372.52,but because I think oftentimes when
5375.28,we're talking about something like
5376.42,omega-3 fatty acids
5378.4,the fact that they are available over
5380.199,the counter in a supplement or by liquid
5382.06,or available in food for that matter
5383.92,leads many people to conclude that oh
5386.08,you know this is supplementation this is
5387.94,something that
5389.08,um you know it's going to have
5390.58,relatively weak or minor impact on
5392.56,things like headache or other health
5393.88,metrics but let's just say that the fact
5397.659,that it exists as a prescription drug
5399.52,and its highest potency form at least in
5402.1,my opinion points to the potency of
5405.34,omega-3 fatty acids in dealing with
5408.36,analgesic effects that is reducing pain
5410.86,and anti-inflammation as well as some of
5412.84,the known cardiovascular improvements
5414.76,that are associated with increasing
5416.44,omega-3 fatty acid intake put simply
5419.199,Omega-3s are not just something that
5420.88,comes from food or supplements they are
5422.199,also being marketed as prescription
5423.58,drugs so I do think they need to be
5425.199,considered as quite potent and at least
5427.54,as far as these papers that again
5429.4,include meta-analyzes of many other
5431.32,papers and data sets indicate that
5434.56,supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids
5436.54,to a point where you're getting above
5438.76,one gram per day of EPA is not just
5442.0,going to be beneficial for treating and
5443.92,reducing the frequency and intensity of
5445.84,one particular type of headache but many
5448.239,types of headaches and when you combine
5450.04,hormonal headaches tension headaches and
5451.84,migraine headaches you account for more
5453.639,than 70 percent of the total types of
5455.32,headaches that are out there the effects
5457.48,of Omega-3s on cluster headaches and
5459.1,some of the other types of headaches at
5460.36,least to my knowledge have not been
5461.62,evaluated
5462.699,there's no reason to think that Omega-3s
5465.159,would not be beneficial for those types
5467.08,of headaches but at least as far as the
5469.659,data sets we talked about here are
5471.52,concerned it is clear omega-3 fatty
5473.98,acids are going to be a very potent way
5476.44,to reduce pain and to reduce
5478.9,inflammation in ways that can reduce the
5481.84,frequency and the intensity of different
5484.0,kinds of headache before we continue our
5485.92,discussion about many not commonly known
5488.679,and yet very potent treatments for
5490.54,different forms of headache I want to
5492.34,touch on a topic we mentioned a little
5494.02,bit earlier and also provide a treatment
5496.9,that is in a way to alleviate something
5499.0,and that's photophobia and Aura now keep
5502.239,in mind that earlier I referred to Aura
5503.98,as this sense that something's about to
5506.199,happen that is true and that meaning
5508.659,that is an accurate description of Aura
5510.699,but oftentimes people also come to
5513.159,understand Aura as the feeling that
5515.5,something surrounds a given object
5517.42,visually or even that people have a
5520.12,sense that something's around them so
5522.219,again this can be a little bit vague but
5524.199,this idea that aura is a sense of
5526.239,something about to happen or that
5527.679,visually or in an auditory way and or
5529.96,maybe even in kind of a sense that
5532.42,something is about to happen in a
5534.639,certain environment and the reason I'm
5536.5,making uh kind of Arc shapes with my
5538.54,hands for those of you that are just
5539.5,listening I'm making art shapes with my
5540.88,hands is that aura is often described as
5543.04,kind of a Halo or a um emanating out
5545.92,from from one's body or from something
5547.9,that they're looking at again nothing
5549.34,spiritual about this in the context of
5551.98,the discussion about migraine and
5553.659,headache but rather many people
5555.58,experience photophobia sometimes with
5557.5,aura sometimes no and I just want to
5560.44,touch on a couple of the mechanisms by
5562.84,which aurum photophobia occur and
5565.0,mentioned just briefly a pretty well
5567.76,established way that people can start to
5570.219,offset photophobia and again I mentioned
5572.5,that because many people experience
5573.639,photophobia in headache but there are
5575.8,also a number of people that experience
5577.179,photophobia even if they don't have
5578.8,intense headaches so photophobia is
5580.659,pretty common pretty debilitate it
5583.179,actually is one of the reasons why
5584.26,people feel not well and need to leave
5586.239,work or not go to school or or leave
5589.42,school these kinds of things or lay in
5591.159,bed all day or dim the lights not go
5592.78,outside again sunlight being so
5595.5,congruent with health you can imagine
5597.639,how photophobia can lead to all sorts of
5599.5,negative Downstream consequences okay so
5602.08,what is Aura and what is photophobia the
5604.9,exact origins of ARA aren't exactly
5608.08,clear but it is generally thought that
5611.139,what Aura represents is what's called
5613.179,spreading depression and this is not
5615.46,depression of one's mood although it can
5618.88,be associated with that this is
5620.8,depression of neuronal activity again
5623.38,neurons communicate with one another by
5625.239,generating electrical impulses that
5627.04,travel down the length of their of their
5629.199,so-called axons which are like little
5630.699,wires and then they dump
5632.199,neurotransmitter out at the so-called
5633.94,synapse and impact the electrical
5635.5,activity of other neurons
5637.62,depression is a electrical or I should
5640.78,say a chemical electrical
5642.9,chemoelectrical is the proper term
5645.0,phenomenon in which the excitability of
5648.219,neurons is reduced so again doesn't have
5650.26,anything to do with depression as a mood
5652.78,State per se rather it is a reduced
5655.78,excitability of neurons and it's been
5658.3,shown in some Imaging studies
5660.46,that aura is associated with a back to
5664.06,front so from the back of the brain to
5665.86,front spreading depression like a wave
5668.26,of lowering levels of electrical
5671.44,excitability and because this originates
5673.9,in the visual cortex which is in the
5675.639,back so that's the part of your brain
5677.02,that is making sense of visual images
5678.58,coming in through the eyes and relayed
5680.5,through other stations in the brain
5682.54,that people will start to see a kind of
5685.659,Halo of light or that they'll start to
5687.94,feel that the light around them is
5690.699,literally surrounding their body or some
5692.92,other object or body that they're
5694.3,looking at and then it spreads forward
5696.94,in the brain and that's when it tends to
5699.28,stretch over into other so-called
5701.139,sensory modalities sensory modalities
5703.42,being things like touch or hearing so
5706.42,people will get the sense that kind of
5708.34,seeing something in their periphery of
5710.139,their Vision then they'll start feeling
5711.88,something around them there's a sense
5713.38,that something's about to happen so is
5715.239,this spreading wave of depression goes
5718.06,from Back to Front people experience a
5720.159,number of these different semi-abstract
5722.08,sensory phenomena that we Call Aura okay
5724.9,so that's how Aura originates now
5726.699,photophobia is a little bit different
5728.8,photophobia We Now understand because of
5731.56,some beautiful work that was done at
5733.84,Cliff saper's Lab at Harvard Medical
5735.52,School and some other Laboratories
5737.62,showing that photophobia originates from
5740.44,a specific set of neurons in the eye we
5743.199,call these the intrinsically
5744.28,photosensitive melanops and ganglion
5746.08,cells which is really just a mouthful of
5748.239,nerd speak for neurons in the eye that
5750.82,connect to the brain these so-called
5752.739,ganglion cells
5754.12,that respond most robustly to bright
5758.32,blue light or other shortwavelength
5760.54,light so you've got short wavelength
5762.04,light that is blue and greens or short
5764.56,wavelengths and then long wavelet light
5766.719,which is red or you know it can even be
5768.94,out past red will be infrared we don't
5770.86,detect infrared consciously other
5772.3,species do like pit vipers can see in
5774.34,the infrared they can even heat sense so
5776.86,short wavelength light is going to be
5778.239,light that's that's bright
5780.239,blue green it's what's very common in
5783.52,fluorescent bulbs that are commonly used
5785.44,in household lighting and workplace
5788.139,lighting and other forms of artificial
5790.36,lighting it's also of course present in
5792.28,sunlight sunlight includes a huge range
5794.679,of wavelengths including long wavelength
5796.36,light of course you've seen that as the
5798.58,Reds and oranges in the sunset and so on
5801.639,those intrinsically photosensitive
5803.92,retinal ganglion cells in the eye
5805.78,respond best to bright green or blue
5808.84,light and they send connections to a
5811.06,bunch of different places in the brain
5812.199,including the so-called Central
5814.239,circadian clock superchiasmatic nucleus
5816.159,that sets your day night sleep wake
5818.26,rhythms this is why I encourage people
5819.94,to view sunlight in the morning to set
5821.38,this system in motion to avoid bright
5823.239,light exposure at night
5825.52,from artificial sources in order to not
5828.699,send wake-up signals from the eye to the
5830.56,brain and then on to the rest of the
5831.94,body but these intrinsically
5833.38,photosensitive retinal ganglion cells
5835.719,are also known to connect with other
5837.34,areas of the brain many other areas of
5839.62,the brain in fact and one of the
5841.239,important areas of the brain they
5842.56,connect to as it relates to photophobia
5844.6,is an area of a structure called the
5846.76,thalamus the thalamus is an egg-like
5848.38,structure that sits in the center of the
5849.76,brain and it serves as a kind of a
5851.86,switchboard like a sensory relay by
5854.86,which information coming from the eyes
5856.96,from the ears from The Touch system Etc
5858.94,are funneled into different compartments
5860.62,in the thalamus and then sent to
5861.94,different other areas of the brain so
5863.739,think of it kind of like an
5864.58,old-fashioned switchboard
5866.08,or
5867.28,um you could think of it uh sort of like
5869.5,a in an airport you go uh to a
5871.659,particular
5872.86,um wing of the airport then you go to a
5874.659,particular gate and so on you're getting
5876.28,funneled progressively through uh
5878.199,narrower narrower channels until you
5879.52,arrive at your particular plane much in
5882.76,the same way the thalamus has a bunch of
5884.26,different entry points
5886.0,so it's sensory information coming in
5887.56,from a bunch of different sources and
5889.06,those sources get routed into
5890.739,progressively narrower and narrower
5892.9,funnels to eventually arrive at the
5894.639,accurate place for their function so
5897.28,these intrinsically photosensitive
5898.54,gangling cells send connections to a
5901.48,small but important area of the thalamus
5903.4,called LP it's denoted L the letter and
5906.76,P with lateral posterior thalamus or
5909.52,that I should say it's the lateral
5911.58,posterior nucleus of the thalamus for
5913.96,uficionados out there and then the
5916.3,neurons in that location are going to
5918.1,respond that is they're going to be
5919.48,activated by bright blue light green
5922.06,light or any kind of bright light
5924.46,originating from artificial sources or
5926.32,from sunlight and the neurons there that
5928.48,respond to that have a very interesting
5930.34,pattern of connections they send
5931.96,connections up to the so-called sensory
5934.48,cortex so a bunch of different layers
5936.94,throughout the cortex that are not
5938.56,associated with visual perception that
5940.719,is they're not associated with
5942.4,understanding that there are shapes and
5944.139,Contours in the environment but rather
5945.639,to neurons that are involved in the
5948.52,detection of pressure pain and other
5952.179,forms of sensory information at the
5954.219,level of what the meninges we talked
5956.86,about the meninges earlier so again
5958.9,while the brain itself does not have a
5961.9,sensory system to detect pain the
5965.32,tissues around it do and the tissues
5968.56,around those
5970.12,tissues that is the stuff around the
5971.92,meninges themselves can respond to pain
5974.32,and intracranial pressure is also
5976.96,relayed through the meninges to our
5979.3,conscious awareness that there's pain so
5980.679,what does this mean for photophobia it
5982.3,means that
5983.5,bright blue light and green light and of
5986.199,course light from sunlight
5987.88,we'll activate these neurons in the eye
5989.92,these intrinsically photosensitive
5991.36,ganglion cells which then activate the
5992.92,lateral posterior neurons LP neurons and
5995.5,those LP neurons communicate with areas
5997.12,of the brain that are specifically tuned
5999.34,to different sensory phenomena and in
6002.76,particular pain at the level of the
6004.98,meninges and intracranial pressure what
6007.739,this means is that when we have headache
6010.8,or if we simply have photophobia on its
6013.26,own that bright light is actually the
6015.659,trigger for pain sensing and even the
6019.08,creation of pain at the level of the
6020.699,meninges and intracranial pressure what
6022.86,does this mean in terms of dealing with
6024.3,or treating photophobia well most people
6026.219,deal with photophobia by deciding to
6028.38,turn off or dim all the lights and
6030.179,simply getting under the covers or
6031.5,wearing a very um low brim hat and
6034.26,putting on sunglasses and they want to
6036.179,lie down
6037.5,and sometimes because uh migraine can be
6040.02,associated with nausea or even vomiting
6041.699,and it's severe instances rather but one
6046.02,very simple way to avoid activation of
6048.36,these retinal ganglion cells that would
6049.98,trigger photophobia is that if you are
6052.679,starting to feel like you have a
6053.82,migraine coming on or you have
6054.9,photophobia coming on to shift to using
6057.36,patterns of light that are in the longer
6059.159,wavelength domain what that means
6062.4,practically is Shifting to using very
6065.4,orange ideally dim but very orange and
6068.82,red light now this is not a call for
6071.219,people to go out and invest in expensive
6073.8,red light therapies admittedly there are
6076.38,some excellent case uses for red light
6078.96,therapy particularly for acne wound
6081.239,healing even for improving Vision
6082.92,especially in people beyond the age of
6084.78,40 for some hormone augmentation we
6086.88,talked all about that in the episode
6088.32,that I did on light and health again you
6090.36,can find that at hubermanlab.com
6091.92,everything time stamped what I'm talking
6094.08,about here would be simply having some
6096.54,red light bulbs on hand for any time
6099.239,that you need to remain awake but you're
6101.52,starting to experience photophobia these
6103.44,red light bulbs can be purchased very in
6105.179,expensively
6106.699,you know as party lights you can buy
6109.199,these online so there is no specific
6111.3,need to get any uh I would say red light
6114.9,that's designed specifically for
6116.159,photophobia or anything that sort you
6117.719,can find the cheapest um red light
6120.6,available out there and those will
6122.4,simply work the idea being that for many
6124.98,people who are experiencing photophobia
6126.54,they want to reduce that feeling of pain
6128.699,and pressure in their head experience
6130.139,through photophobia they also might want
6131.46,to stay awake get some work done and do
6132.96,things so operating under red light or I
6135.659,should say living working Etc under red
6137.82,light would allow you to stay awake not
6139.38,have to hide under the covers if you're
6140.82,experiencing photophobia in addition and
6142.92,I mentioned this at the beginning of the
6144.119,episode but many people find photophobia
6146.52,to be a entry point or a trigger to
6150.0,headache so what happens is they start
6152.159,to experience some Aura some onset of
6154.44,photophobia and then the photophobia
6156.3,itself leads to this feeling of malaise
6158.58,that then converts into headache and so
6160.739,while there are not a lot of clinical
6162.179,data on this just yet an emerging idea
6165.0,in the realm of headache treatment is
6166.8,the idea that if you can offset some of
6168.78,the early signs you can offset some of
6170.58,that photophobia and aura
6173.159,perhaps to the use of dim red lights or
6175.679,red lights as I've described a moment
6177.239,ago then you might be able to reduce the
6179.94,probability that you're going to have a
6181.44,migraine or other type of headache
6183.0,entirely so again no need for expensive
6185.58,red lights but you can find red lights
6187.679,very easily online and simply have them
6190.38,on hand or replace the current lights
6191.94,that you have on your nightstand or in
6193.44,whatever room you happen to be in with
6195.06,these red lights these red lights are
6196.739,also I should mention very useful in
6198.42,limiting the amount of cortisol a stress
6200.219,hormone that is very healthy for us to
6202.32,release at high levels early in the day
6203.76,in fact viewing sunlight will increase
6205.679,cortisol levels it's another reason why
6208.739,what I'm about to say is relevant to
6210.36,photophobia but if you want to keep
6212.219,cortisol levels low in the evening and
6214.199,at night and indeed you do and improve
6216.3,the transition to sleep and indeed your
6217.86,sleep overall reducing cortisol at
6220.679,evening time and at night time is
6222.3,extremely beneficial and red lights will
6224.159,help you accomplish that I talked about
6225.54,that in the episode on light and health
6227.28,so the point here is that if you suffer
6229.44,from photophobia with or without aura
6231.78,using red lights and not simply dimming
6234.5,ordinary artificial lights or feeling
6236.639,that you have to turn off all lights
6237.96,entirely is going to be one relatively
6240.96,inexpensive or I should say a very
6243.48,inexpensive in some cases because these
6245.159,red lights can be found very
6246.48,inexpensively online way to be able to
6249.3,continue with your daily activities at
6251.1,least in an indoor environment
6252.84,if you are suffering from photophobia so
6255.179,shifting back to ways to reduce the
6256.98,intensity and frequency of different
6258.96,kinds of headaches we haven't talked so
6261.06,much about tension headaches
6262.619,specifically so that's what I'd like to
6263.88,do now is you recall tension headaches
6265.8,are going to be muscular in origin again
6268.08,keeping in mind that everything's neural
6269.82,when it comes to pain everything's
6271.32,normal when it comes to everything
6272.1,frankly because every organ and tissue
6274.139,system in our body is ultimately
6275.4,controlled by our nervous system but
6278.219,tension headaches are often associated
6280.26,with tension of the muscles that are on
6282.84,the skull of the jaw of the neck and can
6287.159,be quite painful for many people and
6289.199,debilitating and the most common
6290.58,treatment for this that most people rely
6292.5,on that is is to take non-steroid
6295.44,anti-inflammatory so things like
6297.06,acetaminophen ibuprofen sometimes
6299.639,aspirin and things of that sort and
6301.8,oftentimes those can be helpful there
6303.54,are a couple things to keep in mind
6304.5,however the NSAIDs non-steroid
6307.199,anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will
6309.9,work very well at first but people
6312.42,quickly develop a tolerance to them
6314.88,meaning they're going to have to take
6316.199,more and more in order to get the same
6317.94,effect and oftentimes they can't take
6320.1,more and more because some of them are
6321.78,very hard on the liver and in addition
6324.3,to that some of them can offset some
6326.1,other things that you really want so for
6327.6,instance it's now known that non-steroid
6329.46,anti-inflammatory drugs can offset some
6331.44,of the benefits of exercise and that
6332.88,makes sense because a lot of the
6333.78,Adaptive benefits of exercise actually
6335.34,come from experiencing a lot of
6337.32,inflammation acute that means you
6339.239,actually want inflammation during a
6340.679,resistance training workout or even your
6342.119,endurance workout but then that
6343.8,inflammation triggers an adaptation
6345.42,event or series of adaptation events
6347.639,that leads to Greater strength greater
6349.08,speed more muscle
6350.699,more endurance whatever it is that you
6352.199,happen to be training for so reducing
6354.42,pain can be good of course but not if
6356.34,you have to take more and more of a
6357.6,given drug that it has side effects on
6360.179,the liver and can offset the effects of
6362.219,exercise and so forth the other issue
6364.38,with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
6366.3,is that many of them simply do not work
6368.1,for many people or again they'll work
6370.26,the first time and the second time but
6371.699,then they stop working they also tend to
6373.32,lower body temperature I think most
6375.719,people are aware of this because many of
6377.699,these same drugs are used in order to
6380.1,reduce fever but if you are taking
6382.86,non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
6384.6,simply to reduce your headache and your
6386.46,lowing core body temperature that can
6388.26,have all sorts of Downstream issues
6390.179,related to sleep wake Cycles to
6392.219,metabolism to immune system function
6394.08,more generally and on and on for that
6396.42,reason
6397.44,there's been quite a lot of exploration
6399.48,of alternatives to non-steroid
6402.06,anti-inflammatory drugs for the
6404.28,treatment of headache and indeed pain
6406.98,generally but today we're talking about
6408.3,headache now as it relates to Tension
6410.639,Headache one of the more advanced kind
6413.219,of modern treatments that you sometimes
6414.54,hear about is Botox right Botox I think
6417.54,most people are familiar with as the
6419.28,thing that people get injected into
6420.6,their face around the eyes or around the
6423.0,lips or elsewhere in order to quote
6425.1,unquote reduce wrinkles it was
6426.9,discovered some years ago when Botox
6428.46,treatments were being done for cosmetic
6430.02,reasons that it could often be very
6432.719,effective for relieving headache if
6434.699,injected into the muscles and the way
6436.739,that it works is that of course Tension
6439.02,Headache involves a tension of the
6440.4,muscles
6441.239,a kind of a we'll call it clinching or
6443.76,cinching up with the muscles but we're
6444.84,really talking about is contraction of
6446.219,the muscles and that's controlled by
6448.619,neurons neurons which are neuromuscular
6451.38,so neuromuscular neurons that don't form
6454.26,synapses with or connections with other
6456.6,neurons they form synapses with muscle
6458.76,they release acetylcholine onto the
6460.739,muscle and that makes the muscle
6461.699,contract this is the way you move the
6463.199,limbs of your body this is also a way
6465.06,the muscles of your head contract and
6467.58,can give you tension type headaches
6469.8,Botox
6471.32,arises from or is rather botulinum
6475.44,neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin is a
6477.659,toxin that's found in canned goods not
6479.82,all canned goods of course and what it
6481.679,does is it it prevents a certain step in
6484.92,the release of so-called
6486.96,neurotransmitter in the little packets
6489.48,that they live in which are called
6490.98,vesicles little little spheres of
6493.139,neurotransmitter live at the end of
6494.699,neuron nerve Terminals and are released
6496.26,onto the muscle make the muscle contract
6498.08,botulinum neurotoxin Cleaves a
6501.06,particular protein in there for you
6502.26,aficionados who want to look this up
6503.639,it's a really cool mechanism it Cleaves
6505.5,something called Snap 25. Snap 25 is
6508.56,involved in the fusion of those little
6510.54,spheres with the membrane of the neuron
6512.94,and releasing of the neurotransmitter so
6514.619,when botulinum neurotoxin is present at
6517.199,the nerve muscle interface those nerves
6519.96,cannot communicate with the muscle and
6521.52,as a consequence the muscles undergo
6523.8,kind of flaccid tone they just kind of
6526.38,relax there underneath the skin
6528.84,sure wrinkles are relieved but if Botox
6531.719,is injected into the muscles themselves
6533.699,it can provide long-lasting relief of
6536.219,certain types of headaches in particular
6538.02,tension type headaches so while it seems
6540.54,like a bit of an extreme treatment
6541.8,people who suffer very badly from
6543.659,tension type headaches due to hyper
6545.58,contraction of the muscles of the
6547.92,forehead or around the temples or around
6550.26,the Jaws or the or certain parts of the
6552.36,the neck and the MUSC muscles of the
6554.1,neck that encroach on the on the back of
6555.9,the skull
6556.8,or that actually connect to the back of
6558.54,the skull can achieve tremendous long
6561.179,lasting relief from these Botox
6562.56,injections sometimes for weeks or months
6565.02,or even longer people go in for periodic
6567.119,uh you know re-ups of Botox it actually
6570.179,is quite safe despite the fact that
6572.159,botulinum neurotoxin is quite dangerous
6574.02,it's given in very low Doses and given
6576.6,locally so those are the only muscles
6577.98,affected so that's how Botox is used to
6579.96,treat headaches and um it's a very
6582.179,effective treatment at that of course
6583.8,many people I imagine are interested in
6586.619,not just drug based treatments and not
6589.08,Botox type treatments
6591.239,for treating headache but other types of
6593.82,treatments for headache that are of the
6595.8,more so let's call them natural or um
6598.46,non-drug treatments and here we're
6600.719,starting to get into the realm of the
6602.34,kind of herbal and oil-based treatments
6605.04,for headache now I confess when I first
6606.719,started researching this area of
6608.46,headache and treatment for headaches
6610.32,that is
6611.699,um I found myself approaching it with a
6614.159,bit of trepidation because when I
6615.54,started to hear about essential oils and
6617.58,about herbal medications and things of
6620.46,that sort I thought okay well there'll
6622.38,probably be some effects I mean
6623.58,admittedly we've talked before on this
6625.08,podcast about things like apogenin
6627.179,epigenin is one of the core components
6630.119,of chamomile
6631.44,and chamomile is known to make people
6633.78,feel a little bit sleepy and can enhance
6635.94,sleep well apogenic and high
6637.56,concentration can indeed augment sleep
6639.78,we talk about this in our sleep tool kit
6642.0,by the way we don't just have episodes
6643.44,about sleep master or sleep perfect your
6645.119,sleep Etc but if you go to the
6646.679,hubermanlab.com website and you go to
6648.84,the menu and you click on newsletter you
6650.699,can scroll down you'll see that we have
6651.84,a tool kit for sleep this is completely
6653.28,zero cost to access you don't even have
6654.78,to sign up although if you'd like to
6656.28,sign up for future newsletters you can
6658.139,get those one of the key components of
6660.96,the toolkit for sleep in addition to
6663.06,behavioral tools and things that are not
6664.619,supplement based is apogenin which is
6667.02,this component from chamomile so the
6669.719,idea that certain herbal derivatives or
6672.48,herbs or Oils could be very useful for
6676.32,improving symptoms of whatever in this
6678.659,case
6679.38,improving sleep with apogenin is not
6681.78,unheard of and in fact the data
6683.4,continued to be released all the time
6685.139,that many of the things that we think of
6686.82,as herbal Etc can actually have quite
6689.1,potent effects and so
6691.199,um while I myself was approaching the
6693.3,discussion about essential oils and um
6695.46,or I should say oils right who's to say
6697.619,if they're essential or not oils and
6700.199,herbs in the treatment of headache I
6702.659,finished out my research on this
6704.639,literature feeling
6706.86,um quite I should say uh surprised and
6710.4,um and as if I need to really check
6711.96,myself a bit because what I found is
6714.0,that there are certain herbs and oils
6715.56,for instance that far outperform
6718.4,non-steroid and anti-inflammatory drugs
6721.08,for the treatment of headache that's
6722.52,right there are certain oils that are
6723.96,available over the counter that when
6725.699,looked at in many studies meta-analyzes
6729.179,and I'll tell you about one particular
6730.32,study and a meta-analysis in a moment
6733.02,they show that they can reduce the
6735.0,frequency and intensity of headache in a
6738.0,manner that far outpaces What You
6740.4,observe with non-steroid
6741.48,anti-inflammatory drugs with apparently
6743.28,none of the same issues associated with
6745.02,non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs so I
6747.719,think it's really worth paying attention
6749.04,to the first of those studies I'd like
6750.84,to describe to you is one that has now
6753.239,become kind of a classic in the
6754.619,literature I should say at least for
6756.179,those that are interested in the
6757.679,atypical treatments for headache and the
6759.719,title of this paper is effective
6761.52,peppermint and eucalyptus oil
6763.139,preparations on neurophysiological and
6765.6,experimental
6767.06,alge's metric headache parameters okay
6770.159,what does that mean well this is an
6772.139,interesting study because rather than
6773.52,look at the effectiveness of peppermint
6775.86,and eucalyptus oil and other oils on
6777.9,headache what they did is because they
6780.3,want to look at the mechanisms
6781.98,underlying headache which I confess I
6783.6,love the fact that they want to
6784.739,understand the neurophysiology and not
6787.02,just get subjective ratings of headache
6788.52,although they did that too but they
6789.6,really want to understand
6791.04,how these oils can impact things like
6793.139,muscular tension or perception of pain
6795.239,what they did is they recreated headache
6798.239,in human subjects by using tightening
6800.94,cuffs of the of the head they cut off
6803.52,blood supply to certain areas of the
6805.38,head they basically induced headache and
6807.659,then they measured things like the EMG
6809.82,the muscle response at the level of
6811.739,electrophysiology in the muscle and of
6814.32,course subjective measures of how much
6815.82,people perceive to be in pain or not in
6817.679,pain I'll give you the broad Contour of
6820.08,the study because I want to make sure
6821.1,that it's the conclusions that come
6822.659,through most clearly and we will provide
6824.04,a link to the study in our show note
6825.54,captions so what they did is they had
6828.3,people use one of four different
6831.239,preparations say preparation one which
6833.4,includes some peppermint oil and some
6836.04,eucalyptus oil and all the details about
6838.199,the amount and the relative percentages
6839.76,are in the paper for you to peruse
6841.139,online through the link I mentioned
6843.54,before so they had four different groups
6845.28,they had one group
6846.78,apply peppermint oil but that peppermint
6849.719,oil also contained eucalyptus oil they
6852.239,had another group used just peppermint
6853.86,oil they had another group use just tiny
6856.619,traces of peppermint oil and smaller
6859.26,doses of eucalyptus oil and then they
6861.78,had a fourth group which was just using
6864.36,Placebo when I say using what they were
6865.98,doing is they were sponge applying the
6868.619,oil to the temples and forehead of
6871.139,people and then what they did is they
6873.96,used these different approaches to
6876.119,measure the activation of muscles to
6879.42,measure pain and they then induced head
6883.08,pain they induced headache so and they
6885.119,looked at the temporal muscles on the
6886.679,side they looked at forehead muscles
6887.82,things of that sort so they used three
6889.5,different types of pain stimuli they
6891.719,looked at people's sensitivity to
6894.119,experimentally induced Pain by either
6896.94,providing pressure so this was kind of a
6900.06,cuff around the forehead
6901.98,or thermal pain so they actually had
6904.5,them basically heat heat it up at the
6907.38,level of the skin and actually they
6910.679,brought the heat up pretty high to the
6912.42,point where people were rating the pain
6914.04,almost to the to the point of um
6916.139,excessive pain and pain limits so they
6918.179,obviously couldn't take them to the
6919.32,point of extreme pain and they had a
6921.9,constriction type condition in which
6924.54,they cut off blood circulation to the
6926.46,pericranial muscles using an inflatable
6928.679,collar around the cranium and they
6930.6,inflated that to pretty high pressure so
6932.699,kind of a brutal experiment to be
6935.28,involved in but look they're trying to
6936.719,mimic headache and I think by using
6939.179,these different approaches they're able
6940.44,to mimic the different aspects of
6941.699,headache and make sure and here's the
6943.92,key point that every person in the study
6946.32,is not just getting the same treatment
6947.58,for headache but is getting the same
6949.199,headache and that's something that I
6950.82,think gives this study power it's not
6952.8,the only way to do a study like this but
6954.239,it gives it a lot of power in trying to
6955.98,understand which types of interventions
6957.9,are going to assist in headache and
6959.699,maybe even specific dimensions of the
6961.5,pain and headache and basically what
6963.48,they found in the study is that of all
6965.34,the treatments they used the essential
6967.56,plant oil preparations that contained
6969.9,peppermint
6971.34,and I'll just mention as an aside and in
6973.86,other studies Menthol so these minty
6976.5,type uh essential minty type
6979.8,um what we think of as flavors but are
6982.02,really Aromas as well and as I'll point
6984.48,out the mechanism in a moment they have
6986.219,the effect of significantly reducing the
6988.199,intensity of the pain that is subjects
6990.179,could tolerate the pain far better and
6992.28,experienced less pain subjectively and
6995.219,the magnitude of the effects were really
6996.78,pretty impressive again I went into all
6998.52,this thinking essential oils okay that's
7000.139,like some really woo stuff
7002.6,um you know I don't know about that but
7004.219,it turns out that these essential oils
7007.34,at least the ones that contain
7008.48,peppermint oil with or without
7010.639,eucalyptus oil performed very well in
7013.28,reducing pain the key takeaway from the
7015.26,study is and here I'm paraphrasing from
7017.0,the study of that the combination of
7018.679,peppermint oil eucalyptus oil and these
7021.5,are basically in a ethanol suspension
7023.659,again people are not drinking these
7025.46,essential oils I want to be very clear
7026.659,they're applying these to the to the
7028.52,skin
7029.3,around the area that's in pain and
7031.46,particularly the temple and the
7032.48,foreheads
7033.98,increased cognitive performance I didn't
7035.9,talk about that but this is the ability
7037.34,to maintain cognitive functioning while
7039.26,in pain you know here we're talking
7040.88,about headache up until now just as kind
7043.94,of pain but that pain can be very
7045.92,debilitating for your ability to work
7047.42,and perform and do other things so this
7049.58,combination of peppermint oil and
7050.96,eucalyptus oil applied to the skin allow
7053.78,people to increase their cognitive
7055.28,performance while under pain and had a
7057.44,very muscle relaxing
7059.3,and mentally relaxing effect mental
7061.52,relaxation was of course measured
7063.38,subjectively but remember one of the
7064.88,things that led me to feature this study
7067.28,in this episode in particular is that
7069.619,they didn't just say oh my muscles feel
7071.42,more relaxed they actually saw that the
7073.46,muscles of the forehead and temples and
7076.58,some surrounding muscles were more
7078.139,relaxed when people had these oils on
7080.9,applied to their forehead and the
7082.82,temples not perhaps to the same degree
7085.4,that one would observe with botox or for
7087.739,the same extent or duration as one would
7089.659,experience with botox but much in the
7091.34,same way which then raises the question
7093.02,of what's going on here I mean is this
7094.94,all placebo effect well no because they
7096.5,compared to Placebo and they controlled
7098.36,for the odor of course of the oil that
7101.06,was applied so that everyone thought
7102.619,that they were getting
7103.88,essentially the same thing pun intended
7106.76,but in this case what they found is that
7109.82,if they applied the essential oil to the
7113.42,forehead and temples that people
7116.36,experience a more or less a cooling
7118.099,sensation or they could feel as if
7119.599,something was happening in the
7120.92,underlying muscle well what was
7122.48,happening we now know that Menthol
7125.36,peppermint and other things that smell
7128.3,that way and taste that way actually
7130.159,have an impact on the sensory neurons at
7132.199,the level of the skin and can actually
7134.659,inhibit certain Sensory neurons and can
7137.78,activate other Sensory neurons okay so
7140.659,in order to understand this we have to
7142.28,go back to what I said at the beginning
7143.36,of the episode which is that you have
7144.679,motor neurons these are neurons that
7146.06,constrict muscles or excuse me that
7148.099,cause contraction of muscles
7150.739,strict them they cause contraction of
7152.599,muscles you have Sensory neurons which
7154.219,sense different things light sound or
7156.32,touch and you have modulatory neurons
7158.86,Menthol and Eucalyptus are actually
7161.0,known to activate certain channels in
7163.82,the sensory neurons that respond not
7166.52,just a touch but also the sensation of
7168.679,cooling okay so when we think of Menthol
7170.9,and peppermint we think of kind of cool
7173.3,scents and flavors cool meaning cold
7176.42,and when we think of things like hot
7178.46,peppers capsaicin we think of anything
7181.46,that has a hot temperature we tend to
7183.44,think of spicy so spicy and hot go
7185.36,together and peppermint and menthol
7188.84,and cool go together much in the way
7191.42,that the gum commercials or the mint
7193.639,commercials would lead you to believe
7195.26,and in fact they're right so what's
7197.48,happening here is that the application
7198.92,of these oils is very likely activating
7200.719,channels in the sensory neurons
7202.099,including the trip channels but others
7203.54,as well that are leading to the analges
7205.88,effect by shutting down the heat and
7209.84,pain Pathways because heat and pain
7211.639,while they're not exactly the same in
7213.86,our nervous system they are funneled
7215.54,through common Pathways whereas Cooling
7218.3,and Pain Relief are funneled through
7220.82,alternate what we call parallel Pathways
7222.98,so the study on peppermint and
7225.199,eucalyptus oil preparations in reducing
7228.199,pain of headache and different aspects
7231.08,of pain due to headache I think are
7233.0,really important because they don't just
7234.739,illustrate the fact that yes indeed and
7236.9,you know going record saying it because
7238.28,that's what the data say and there are
7240.02,other papers to support this statement
7241.34,as well essential oils applied to the
7243.619,skin can reduce the symptoms of tension
7245.48,headache in a significant way and
7247.159,actually can lead to some offset of some
7249.5,of the cognitive
7250.699,defects seen with headaches so that's
7252.619,itself very impressive I must say
7255.02,surprising for me kind of put me in my
7256.94,place as somebody thought oh essential
7258.38,oils is going to be like okay but it's
7260.54,actually seemed to um really hold some
7262.46,Merit and when you compare the magnitude
7264.56,of the effect even though this was an
7266.06,enormous number of subjects you compare
7268.04,the magnet to the effect in a paper like
7270.32,this or similar papers on these
7272.239,essential oils to the impact of
7274.099,non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and
7276.44,they really hold their own and in some
7277.88,cases exceed the positive impact of
7280.82,anti-inflammatory drugs so for that
7282.8,reason I think we can look at peppermint
7284.599,oils and peppermint and Eucalyptus
7286.52,containing oils Menthol containing oils
7288.32,applied to the skin for the treatment of
7290.659,tension type headache as um among the
7293.0,more potent treatments available out
7294.619,there now another way to approach
7296.48,treatment of tension headache is
7298.159,something that many of you have probably
7299.3,heard about before
7300.8,and then I've talked a little bit about
7302.42,on this podcast in previous episodes and
7304.639,that's acupuncture we will do an entire
7306.739,episode all about acupuncture but much
7308.9,in the same way that essential oils I
7311.0,think for many people not all but for
7312.679,many people are considered kind of a woo
7314.9,biology or people think of it as a very
7316.82,alternative medicine keep in mind that
7319.52,as the underlying mechanisms of things
7321.5,like these peppermint oils are starting
7323.06,to be discovered or Omega-3s are
7324.739,starting to be discovered
7325.78,mechanistically they hold up very well
7328.04,there's a logic there there's an
7329.54,underlying understanding of not just why
7332.78,they should work but in many cases how
7334.4,they work in the same way acupuncture
7337.159,which of course has existed for
7338.719,thousands of years has been used very
7341.42,successfully to treat headache and other
7342.98,forms of pain so much so that many
7345.86,insurance companies will now pay for
7348.199,acupuncture as an insured practice not
7350.84,all but many will and in addition to
7353.179,that
7353.96,the scientific Community is starting to
7355.699,understand mechanistically how
7357.02,acupuncture works so I don't want to
7358.52,make this the major Focus for now
7360.739,but
7362.06,very briefly there's a laboratory at
7364.639,Harvard Medical School run by chufuma
7367.159,chufu is well known in the Neuroscience
7369.26,Community for doing excellent work in
7371.719,parsing the mechanisms of touch
7374.54,sensation and pain in particular so not
7377.119,just touch at the level of skin but pain
7378.739,and pain Pathways and in recent years
7380.78,his laboratory has started to do studies
7382.639,on how acupuncture works because indeed
7385.76,acupuncture has been known to work to
7387.38,alleviate pain for a long time but the
7388.94,underlying mechanisms haven't been clear
7391.099,what chufu's lab has published now in
7393.44,excellent journals like nature science
7396.139,and other journals is that the precise
7399.82,insertion sites of different needles
7402.92,lead to activation of sensory neurons
7405.5,and their Downstream Pathways in ways
7407.84,that can potently reduce inflammation
7409.58,and that can be used to potently reduce
7412.699,the activity of certain muscles
7415.46,for instance muscles in the forehead and
7417.98,temples so when you hear acupuncture can
7420.32,reduce pain I think some people think oh
7421.76,well if there's needles sticking out of
7423.139,your face first of all that must hurt
7424.4,and actually the needles are very fine
7425.659,needles and skilled acupuncturists can
7427.52,insert them without any pain or actually
7429.8,the person receiving it doesn't even
7431.719,usually recognize that the needles are
7433.46,in that's how quickly and efficiently
7436.219,they can put them in and people don't
7437.36,detect any pain but that has been shown
7440.659,to greatly reduce pain in particular
7443.599,headache related pain and back-related
7445.94,pain in some other forms of pain chufu's
7448.34,lab has shown that the specific needle
7450.92,insertion sites can activate the sensory
7453.199,Pathways and can deactivate the sensory
7456.98,motor pathways and now you're familiar
7459.44,with Sensory neurons motor neurons and
7461.06,modulatory neurons and can modulate the
7464.54,activity of the pain Pathways by way of
7467.239,impacting the activity of all sorts of
7469.34,different organs including organs that
7471.32,give rise to some of the inflammatory
7473.0,cytokines so basically what I'm saying
7475.159,here is that thanks to thousands of
7477.679,years of acupuncture and the maps of
7479.659,different insertion sites we now know or
7482.96,I should say people have long known and
7484.94,people in the west are starting to adopt
7487.219,the understanding that acupuncture yes
7489.5,indeed it really does work for relieving
7491.599,pain and Laboratories both in the United
7493.46,States such as chufus and elsewhere are
7496.88,starting to find the underlying
7498.139,mechanisms and those mechanisms include
7500.38,deactivation of the pain Pathways
7503.38,activation of some of the parallel
7505.46,Pathways that assist in shutting down
7507.679,pain or in relaxing the muscles that are
7510.08,causing tension type headache as well as
7513.159,activation of neural Pathways that
7515.719,impinge on organs that then cause or
7518.599,reduce the release of molecules into the
7520.76,body that give us the experience of pain
7522.44,so reduced inflammation and in many
7524.179,cases increasing anti-inflammatory
7526.699,Pathways so I just want to be sure to
7529.099,mention acupuncture and a little bit of
7531.38,mechanistic understanding of why
7532.88,acupuncture works because indeed
7534.5,acupuncture is shown to be quite
7536.179,effective for the treatment of tension
7537.739,type headache and to some extent
7539.239,migraine headache as well so we talked
7541.34,about omega-3 fatty acids we talked
7543.44,about essential oils we talked about
7545.0,acupuncture
7546.38,so this episode is starting to sound
7548.06,like alternative treatments to headache
7550.699,including migraine but I want to be very
7552.8,clear this is not about alternative
7555.26,treatments everything that I'm talking
7557.0,about here has a mechanistic basis and
7560.06,what we're talking about today are
7561.98,approaches to dealing with headache that
7564.619,yes are typically over-the-counter
7566.9,compounds or are grounded in nutrition
7569.659,or in the case of acupuncture behavioral
7571.76,practices
7573.02,but that are not necessarily meant as
7576.02,replacements for things like non-steroid
7577.94,inflammatory drugs or prescription drugs
7579.98,of course those things can still be
7581.599,taken many people derive benefit from
7583.4,them but the goal is always I believe I
7586.88,should hope for people to find ways that
7589.34,they can control their health outcomes
7591.619,and reduce things like headache using a
7594.5,minimum number of things that have other
7596.42,side effects and that of course can also
7599.239,include the use of essential oils in
7601.04,conjunction with things like non-steroid
7602.719,anti-inflammatory drugs or the use of
7604.94,red light to offset photophobia in
7606.98,conjunction with any number of different
7608.96,treatments either prescription or
7610.76,otherwise so I do want to make that
7612.08,clear and I especially want to make that
7613.82,clear as I transition to the next
7615.86,segment where I'm going to tell you
7617.119,about herbal treatments for migraine and
7620.0,this is based on what I consider a very
7622.34,comprehensive review of many randomized
7625.94,control studies indeed the title of the
7627.739,paper is herbal treatments for migraine
7629.42,a systematic review of randomized
7631.159,controlled studies and this was
7632.719,published in 2020 and this contains an
7635.0,immense amount of information so we will
7637.28,provide a link to it for those of you
7638.96,that really want to dive deep on this in
7640.76,this paper they focus on a number of
7642.139,different reviews and Analysis of data
7644.48,focused on compounds for the treatment
7646.219,of migraine ranging from and including
7649.4,things like Menthol and peppermint oil
7651.44,so we already covered that so I won't
7653.06,cover that again in detail but in this
7655.04,review they highlight the results I
7657.32,refer to before plus other results that
7659.78,show that Menthol and peppermint oil can
7662.36,be quite effective in the treatment of
7664.52,tension type headache and in this case
7666.86,migraine headache as well so that's
7669.08,interesting that Menthol and peppermint
7670.88,oils can be used not just to treat
7673.099,tension type headaches but
7675.199,migraine headaches as well and they look
7677.48,at an enormous number of other types of
7680.239,herbal and essential oil type treatments
7682.639,everything from coriander to Citron to
7684.739,damask Rose chamomile lavender a bunch
7687.32,of things so I'm not going to go through
7689.179,each and every one of these in a lot of
7691.4,detail what I've tended to do today and
7693.619,I'm going to do now is to highlight the
7695.599,most potent
7696.98,of these different treatments again
7699.38,Menthol peppermint oil being among the
7701.42,most potent in addition to that there's
7704.119,a particular pathway that's associated
7705.92,with headache and when I say that I mean
7709.219,the different types of headache which
7711.08,includes the activation of this thing
7713.239,that we call cgrp cgrp again is involved
7716.06,in this calcium regulation pathway and
7717.98,leads to vasodilation
7720.139,of the vessels and arteries and
7723.199,capillaries in a way that can create
7724.52,pain and this feeling of pressure inside
7726.56,the head which can be very uncomfortable
7728.54,of course
7729.8,now earlier in the episode I mentioned
7732.44,that I was going to touch on caffeine
7734.54,and so I'm going to do that now now the
7736.699,reason I mention caffeine is that
7738.139,there's a sort of lore out there that if
7741.02,you have a headache drinking a cup of
7742.639,coffee can eliminate that headache a few
7745.46,things about that point first of all if
7747.619,you are somebody who ingests caffeine
7749.96,every day and you do not ingest caffeine
7752.78,you will indeed get a headache and
7755.42,drinking caffeine will relieve that
7757.76,particular headache so it's absolutely
7759.44,true that caffeine can relieve the lack
7762.02,of caffeine induced headache that's sort
7764.36,of a duh but that leads actually to a
7768.08,very important question which is why
7770.179,would that be the case well it turns out
7771.92,that caffeine is both a vasodilator and
7775.82,a vasoconstrictor
7777.92,how does it do that well one of the main
7780.139,ways in which caffeine makes us more
7781.88,alert is that it occupies The receptors
7784.4,for something called adenosine adenosine
7786.32,is a molecule that builds up in the
7788.06,brain and body more and more the longer
7790.04,we've been awake it's one of the things
7791.659,that makes us feel sleepy
7793.639,so when we drink caffeine that caffeine
7795.98,occupies the adenosine receptor and the
7798.26,adenosine cannot have its normal effect
7800.0,of making us sleepy when that caffeine
7802.099,wears off the adenosine combine and we
7803.96,feel sleepy adenosine is a vasodilator
7807.92,so when we drink caffeine because it
7810.679,blocks the effects of adenosine there is
7813.08,a vasoconstriction associated with
7815.719,drinking caffeine so if you have a
7818.239,headache that is associated with
7819.619,excessive vasodilation and pressure in
7821.9,the head indeed drinking some caffeine
7823.639,can cause some vasoconstriction by
7826.58,preventing that adenosine pathway that
7828.98,would normally lead to vasoconstriction
7830.3,and you can get some relief from that
7831.92,headache however caffeine is also a
7834.739,vasodilator caffeine has the ability to
7837.5,impinge on the so-called no pathway the
7839.48,nitric oxide pathway which is a nerve to
7843.08,blood pathway that involves a few
7844.76,different enzymes that we won't get into
7846.08,right now but maybe in a future episode
7848.239,that causes dilation of the blood
7850.4,vessels and as a consequence drinking
7852.56,caffeine can also increase vasodilation
7854.48,so it's sort of a two-pronged effect now
7856.699,one of the ways in which you might think
7858.619,about this and perhaps utilize this is
7860.9,that if you are well rested or if it's
7863.659,early in the day and you've had some
7865.639,sleep the previous night adenosine
7867.739,levels are very likely to be low
7869.42,especially if you slept very well the
7871.52,night before
7873.44,under those conditions when you ingest
7875.3,caffeine you are not going to experience
7877.94,the vasoconstriction effects of caffeine
7881.36,that would ordinarily be there by
7883.82,inhibiting adenosine why because
7885.619,adenosine is not present at all and
7888.02,under those conditions drinking coffee
7890.06,ought to lead to some vasodilation not a
7892.46,lot but nonetheless vasodilation if
7895.52,however you haven't slept well or it's
7897.44,late in the day and you've been up for a
7898.699,long time drinking caffeine is likely to
7900.56,have more of a vasoconstriction effect
7902.3,and this is important because some of
7904.58,the treatments that you hear about that
7905.9,involve using caffeine to treat headache
7907.94,are as Extreme as okay if you have a
7910.46,headache at night drink a cup of coffee
7911.719,and then go to sleep I actually saw that
7913.4,in the literature which I couldn't quite
7915.619,believe because yes indeed some people
7917.36,can fall asleep after drinking caffeine
7918.86,but we know very well thanks to the
7921.02,beautiful work and science
7922.4,Communications of people like Dr Matthew
7924.38,Walker from University of California
7925.76,Berkeley and who's been a guest on this
7927.56,and many other podcasts that even if you
7930.26,can fall asleep after drinking caffeine
7931.82,ingesting caffeine within the 10 to 12
7933.98,hours prior to bedtime is simply not a
7935.719,good idea because of the ways it
7936.86,disrupts the architecture of sleep so
7938.78,what's the takeaway about caffeine and
7940.28,headache and vasodil relation you need
7942.56,to be very clear on whether or not
7945.08,caffeine tends to remove your headache
7946.88,or exacerbate it now this is going to
7948.619,depend on time of day and the amount of
7950.0,adenosine in your system as I mentioned
7951.5,before but also there seems to be a kind
7953.84,of bimodal distribution whereby some
7955.52,people when they drink caffeine it
7957.38,really improves their headache and so in
7959.719,some cases a very significant effects
7961.28,whereas other people when they drink
7962.659,caffeine it really exacerbates their
7964.4,headache and as at least as far as I
7966.56,could tell from the literature it's not
7967.94,easy to predict who those people are
7969.679,going to be what is reassuring however
7972.079,is it does not seem to be the case that
7973.94,if you're somebody who experiences
7976.04,relief from headaches by drinking
7977.54,caffeine that suddenly
7978.92,one day to the next you're going to
7981.199,experience a worsening of your headache
7982.88,and vice versa is also true so if you're
7984.98,somebody that drinks caffeine and your
7986.78,headaches get worse I don't think
7988.159,there's any reason to think that
7989.119,caffeine one day or from one day to the
7991.28,next rather is going to somehow
7992.659,alleviate your headache so you have to
7993.98,determine for yourself whether or not
7995.179,headaches are relieved or exacerbated by
7997.46,drinking caffeine and if you're
7998.78,wondering why it's so confusing it's
7999.98,because caffeine hits both the
8001.179,vasodilation and the vasoconstriction
8002.92,Pathways and there's nothing you or I or
8005.139,anyone else can do about it now the last
8006.94,thing I'd like to talk about in terms of
8008.38,relief for headaches is something that
8010.659,I'm guessing about probably 25 percent
8013.06,of you are familiar with and 75 percent
8014.679,of you are not which is curcumin
8016.84,curcumin is often also referred to as
8019.239,turmeric and turmeric is a root and
8022.239,curcumin is one of the key components of
8024.04,that root curcumin is known to have very
8027.219,potent anti-inflammatory properties
8030.159,I don't think that's debated at all in
8032.32,fact it's so potent as an
8033.699,anti-inflammatory that some people have
8035.739,cautioned against taking high levels of
8038.02,curcumin prior to for instance
8039.82,resistance training workouts or even
8041.32,cardiovascular workouts because it so
8043.659,prevents inflammation that it also can
8046.119,prevent the adaptation response because
8048.699,remember the inflammation that occurs
8050.44,during exercise both resistance and
8052.3,cardiovascular exercise is at least in
8055.06,part
8056.38,the trigger for the adaptation that it's
8059.02,going to lead to enhanced endurance
8060.639,enhanced strength hypertrophy Etc
8062.219,nonetheless curcumin has been explored
8064.659,in the context of treatment of migraine
8066.34,and it's one of the compounds that was
8068.32,analyzed in extensive detail in this
8070.719,wonderful review that I mentioned a
8072.4,little bit earlier what I like about
8073.9,this study is that they were able to
8075.28,explore the effects of curcumin as
8078.04,explored in previous research studies
8080.02,and compare those across a large range
8083.5,of different dosages and a large range
8086.5,of combinations with other things like
8088.36,coenzyme Q10 which we've talked about on
8090.159,this podcast before but I think for sake
8092.38,of this discussion just really focusing
8094.42,on what curcumin does alone or in
8098.5,conjunction with the omega-3 fatty acids
8100.42,is what turns out to be the most
8101.739,interesting first of all curcumin has
8103.659,been shown to be generally safe for most
8105.88,people at dosages as high as 8 000
8109.3,milligrams per day or eight grams per
8111.099,day now I want to be very clear I do not
8113.199,recommend that anyone take dosages of
8116.02,curcumin an AKA turmeric that are that
8118.119,high why well
8120.34,curcumin and turmeric not only are
8123.219,anti-inflammatory but they also can
8124.9,impinge on other Pathways in particular
8126.579,hormonal Pathways and in fact curcumin
8129.46,AKA turmeric can alter the synthesis of
8134.8,something called dihydrotestosterone
8136.5,dihydrotestosterone is involved in an
8138.34,enormous range of different bodily
8139.719,functions it's involved in libido it's
8141.76,involved in Men in beard growth and in
8144.579,the regulation of a number of different
8146.56,tissues both in the reproductive axis
8148.36,and outside the reproductive axis and
8150.34,curcumin is a potent inhibitor of DHT so
8154.06,I do want to caution that people who
8155.679,take high doses of curcumin and some
8157.42,people who are very sensitive to
8158.679,curcumin will even at low doses
8161.139,experience reductions in DHT that lead
8164.199,to things that they would not like such
8165.88,as sufficient reductions in libido
8168.639,however curcumin has been shown to be
8171.04,effective as an anti-inflammatory and
8172.9,has been shown to be very effective in
8175.9,treating different types of headache and
8177.579,particular migraine headache one of the
8179.32,ways in which curcumin does that is to
8181.84,inhibit this thing that I talked about a
8183.4,few minutes ago which is nitric oxide or
8185.32,no which causes vasodilation and in
8188.98,doing that can reduce the feeling that
8191.5,one has a lot of intracranial pressure
8193.24,okay so curcumin dosages come in
8196.599,enormous range as I mentioned before
8198.0,dosages that range anywhere from 80
8200.439,milligrams taken
8202.24,80 milligrams per day that is taken for
8205.059,eight weeks time that's been examined
8206.8,it's been explored at 80 milligram
8208.24,dosages taken alongside two and a half
8211.32,grams of omega-3 fatty acids or omega-3
8215.2,fatty acids alone
8216.88,and against Placebo and the general
8219.7,conclusion of these studies is that
8221.38,curcumin when taken it at dosages of
8224.26,about 80 milligrams although for those
8226.359,of you very sensitive to curcumin
8227.979,probably as low as 25 or even 50
8230.019,milligrams per day in conjunction with
8232.479,although not necessarily at the same
8233.92,time but taken daily alongside
8237.82,omega-3 fatty acids at two and a half
8240.16,grams per day led to significant
8242.5,improvements in migraine and other forms
8246.219,of headache meaning both the frequency
8247.96,and the intensity of the headaches that
8249.82,occurred was greatly reduced one
8251.92,important point about curcumin to keep
8253.84,in mind is that curcumin is known to
8255.76,inhibit something called cytochrome p450
8258.78,that's associated with an enzymatic
8261.399,pathway and some other things that
8262.899,relate to blood coagulation so for
8265.359,people that are taking medications that
8267.16,are anticoagulants to prevent clotting
8269.38,you do need to be very cautious about
8271.66,using curcumin and of course with
8273.399,curcumin or any other supplement you
8275.019,should always talk to your doctor prior
8276.7,to including it or removing it from your
8279.219,supplement regimen so as you can see
8280.96,there are a number of different things
8282.28,that in addition to prescription drugs
8285.16,and over-the-counter pain medications
8287.019,things like non-steroid
8288.28,anti-inflammatory drugs can really
8290.62,impact the different aspects of headache
8293.32,and different types of headache in some
8295.66,cases differentially now today we talked
8298.179,mainly about tension type and migraine
8299.979,type headaches because those are the
8301.3,most common forms of headache there are
8303.34,of course the cluster type headaches
8304.84,that are of neural origin talked about
8306.639,hormonal headaches and indeed some
8308.5,treatments such as Omega-3s which have
8310.479,been shown to be beneficial for
8311.679,offsetting the menstrual related
8313.84,headaches now in the context of the
8315.82,discussion about Omega-3s keep in mind
8318.34,that Omega-3s can be obtained from
8320.32,supplementation or from nutrition so you
8322.96,don't necessarily have to take omega-3
8324.939,capsules or liquid form Omega-3s if you
8327.939,want to use Omega-3s to Target different
8329.979,symptoms of headache but that probably
8332.26,is going to be the most efficient way to
8333.76,do it given that many foods do contain
8336.76,Omega threes but it's hard to get above
8338.74,that one gram dosage and in fact most of
8342.46,the studies that we talked about today
8343.599,involved getting two or even two and a
8346.96,half or in some cases on this podcast
8348.399,with previous guests such as Dr Rhonda
8350.38,Patrick she talked about the advantages
8351.88,of getting as high as three grams of
8353.8,Omega-3s per day which almost with
8356.26,certainty is going to require some
8357.88,external form of supplementation even
8359.8,for those of you that are making a point
8361.54,to eat fatty ocean fish with the skin on
8364.0,so I just want to make sure that I
8365.8,highlight that before we wrap up I can't
8368.139,help myself but to talk about something
8370.179,that I heard about on the news several
8371.74,years ago and it sounded too outrageous
8373.3,to be true but then was confirmed as
8375.88,accurate by one of my neurologist
8377.26,colleagues that's the fact that eating
8379.479,certain very spicy peppers can induce
8382.96,headache and in some cases can induce
8385.84,brain damage and bear with me here I'm
8388.78,not talking about your traditional
8390.34,jalapeno and I'm acknowledging the fact
8392.68,that certain people can tolerate far
8395.5,more spicy taste case then do others
8398.62,some people are very sensitive to spicy
8400.3,some people can tolerate very spicy food
8402.04,and that one can build up a tolerance to
8404.08,spicy food by ingesting progressively
8406.18,your spicy or excuse me spicy or and
8408.7,spicier Foods over time
8410.68,nonetheless there are these Pepper
8412.54,eating contests out there that um while
8415.78,not very common do exist and people
8417.52,challenge each other to eat peppers of
8420.16,um extreme spiciness and there's one in
8422.02,particular that's referred to as the
8424.12,Carolina Reaper by the way that's not a
8425.74,person as far as I know that's a pepper
8428.14,the Carolina Reaper which is known to
8430.3,have the most potent spice of any pepper
8433.0,and here's why you would not want to eat
8434.8,the Carolina Reaper a few years ago at
8437.02,one of these Pepper eating contests man
8439.3,ate a Carolina Reaper as part of the
8442.06,competition and suddenly experience
8444.399,what's called Thunderclap headache
8445.899,Thunderclap headache is a unique type of
8448.42,headache very different from all the
8450.16,other types of headaches it is not from
8452.5,the surface in so it's not tension
8454.42,headache it's not even the cluster type
8456.819,headache of the nerve activation of the
8458.8,trigeminal it's actually a hyper
8461.979,constriction of the vasculature in the
8463.84,brain caused by the ingestion of the
8466.3,pepper and inflammatory response and
8468.76,remember that heat and spicy go together
8471.34,in these neural Pathways and a bunch of
8474.04,different heat related and spice related
8476.62,Pathways get activated simultaneously
8478.899,when one ingests something of extreme
8480.52,spice and the blood vessels and indeed
8483.88,some of the smaller arteries feeding
8486.34,neural tissue shut down and he
8488.439,experienced this Thunderclap headache
8489.88,which is a brutal headache and sadly in
8492.28,his case um permanent brain damage so
8494.38,loss of neuronal tissue because neuronal
8496.359,tissue is very metabolically active you
8497.859,cut off the blood supply to that tissue
8499.42,Not only would you feel miserable maybe
8502.479,even pass out but lose vision and
8505.54,certain brain areas will actually die
8506.859,off in the absence of blood flow to
8509.5,those areas we know this more commonly
8512.62,as stroke so I don't want to strike fear
8516.46,in anybody about eating a you know a
8518.5,jalapeno or even a very spicy meal from
8521.38,time to time but if you're not somebody
8522.88,who's familiar with eating very spicy
8525.1,foods you certainly don't want to enter
8526.96,one of these competitions and just
8529.18,realize that the pathways from Menthol
8532.359,and cool or spicy and hot those aren't
8535.12,just subjective Pathways these are
8536.979,actually neural Pathways that again
8538.84,originate in our so-called nerds call it
8541.42,the sensory epithelium so our skin our
8543.76,our hearing our eyes and that feed that
8547.66,information into the body to make use of
8550.66,that information some case motor
8551.92,movement so sensory motor in other cases
8554.22,the information can be fed through nerve
8556.96,Pathways that goes to the vasculature
8559.12,and causes the vasculature to either
8560.56,dilate or constrict these very spicy
8562.78,peppers causing as I just mentioned
8564.28,extreme cerebro of of the head of
8567.28,vasoconstriction and brain damage again
8569.439,that's not going to be a common thing
8571.66,out there but nonetheless I encourage
8574.42,people to be very cautious about the
8576.58,Carolina Reaper so today we talked about
8578.56,headaches and first we highlighted the
8581.26,different types of headache making it
8583.12,clear that understanding which headache
8585.1,you might be experiencing
8586.96,can be very beneficial for understanding
8588.939,which sorts of treatments ought to be
8591.04,best and perhaps also best avoided in
8594.22,trying to alleviate those headaches or
8596.26,prevent them from happening at all we
8598.18,talked about tension headaches migraine
8599.74,headaches hormone-based headaches
8601.0,cluster headaches and traumatic brain
8603.28,injury related headaches we talked about
8605.2,different types of treatments ranging
8606.939,from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid
8609.819,supplementation some herbal and indeed
8611.979,some essential oil treatments as well as
8614.02,acupuncture all of which have been shown
8616.42,to have significant impact in reducing
8618.7,the frequency and intensity of headaches
8620.439,and in many cases reductions in the
8622.78,frequency and intensity of headaches
8624.28,that are at least as great as the
8626.62,results they're seen with non-steroid
8628.12,anti-inflammatory drugs again I want to
8630.52,highlight that none of these approaches
8632.26,are necessarily designed to be done on
8634.72,their own or in replacement of
8636.399,prescription drugs from your physician
8637.78,there are excellent prescription drugs
8639.399,out there that your physician can
8640.66,prescribe for you for the treatment of
8642.28,headache nonetheless I think many people
8644.26,who are listeners of this podcast are
8646.24,interested in the things that they can
8647.56,do in order to inoculate themselves or
8650.74,at least reduce the likelihood of
8652.54,experiencing headache especially for
8654.04,people who are experiencing chronic
8656.56,recurring headaches such as migraine or
8659.02,the other forms of headache which can be
8660.399,so debilitating thank you for joining me

8714.64,The huberman Lab podcast we discuss
8716.439,supplements while supplements aren't
8717.88,necessary for everybody many people
8719.68,derive tremendous benefit from them for
8721.66,things like improving sleep hormone
8723.7,support and focus huberman Lab podcast
8725.979,has partnered with momentous supplements
8727.72,because momentous supplements are of the
8729.399,very highest quality and they include
8731.859,single ingredient formulations this is
8733.84,very important as I pointed out in the
8735.819,episode about a rational approach to
8737.38,supplementation single ingredient
8738.88,formulations allow you to develop the
8741.1,most biologically effective and
8742.6,cost-effective approach to
8743.859,supplementation in addition momentous
8746.08,ships internationally which is important
8747.819,because I realize that many of you
8749.439,reside outside of the United States if
