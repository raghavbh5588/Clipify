0.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to
the Huberman Lab podcast,
2.25 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.92 for everyday life.
6.412 [MUSIC PLAYING]
9.07 I'm Andrew Huberman
and I'm a professor
10.84 of neurobiology
and ophthalmology
13.24 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.92 Today, my guest
is Jocko Willink.
17.08 Jocko Willink is a
retired Navy SEAL
19.54 and author of numerous important
books on leadership and team
22.81 dynamics and the host
of the Jocko Podcast.
26.44 During his 20-year
career with the US Navy,
28.84 Jocko served with SEAL
Team 3 as commander
31.39 of Task Unit Bruiser
in Ramadi, Iraq,
34.06 and elsewhere in
the Middle East,
35.59 as well as deployments
in Asia and Europe.
38.45 After retiring from
the Navy, Jocko
40.66 used his experience
and knowledge
42.25 gleaned from his time in
the SEAL teams as a way
45.07 to develop tools
that anybody can
47.26 use to develop their
leadership skills,
49.75 both for leading themselves
and for leading others.
52.54 That took the form of
several important books,
54.64 the first of which
was published in 2015
57.13 and is entitled
Extreme Ownership:
59.2 How US Navy Seals Lead and Win.
61.87 He has also authored
several books
63.7 for kids about leadership,
personal development
66.97 and how to navigate
various aspects of life.
69.46 I've read both Extreme Ownership
and The Way of the Warrior Kid,
72.73 and I found them to
be immensely useful
75.34 in terms of actionable
information and understanding
78.4 of oneself and different
kinds of relationships,
81.19 both in and out
of the workplace.
83.05 Typically, guests on
the Huberman Lab Podcast
85.0 are scientists
and/or clinicians.
88.06 It was some time ago that I was
a guest on the Jocko Podcast.
91.03 And during the course of our
conversation on his podcast,
93.88 we quickly realized that many
of the science-based tools
97.15 that my laboratory
has focused on
99.16 and that I've used
over the years
100.78 and shared on the
Huberman Lab Podcast
102.7 had direct overlap
and parallel with many
105.76 of the tools that Jocko and
other members of the SEAL teams
108.28 had arrived at
independently-- that is,
110.83 without knowledge of
the underlying science.
112.87 And in fact, he
had many more tools
114.91 that he had incorporated during
his years in the SEAL teams
117.55 as well as in
business leadership,
119.29 in family and elsewhere
in life, that I quickly
122.47 realized it would
be an enormously
124.39 valuable conversation to
have him on this podcast
127.37 in order to share those tools
with the general public.
130.06 During today's episode,
we discuss numerous tools
132.37 that Jocko has taught and used
over the years in a number
135.25 of different contexts,
including tools for generating
137.8 more physical energy and
for generating more focus
140.77 and cognitive energy.
142.33 And for navigating
sticking points,
145.24 that is how to deal
with lack of motivation,
148.21 how to deal with
difficult relationships
150.16 in the workplace and elsewhere.
151.6 And perhaps most
importantly, how
154.03 to think about and
navigate the self.
156.118 In fact, we spend
quite a bit of time
157.66 talking about this notion of
the self and one's self identity
161.53 and how self identity
plays into our ability
164.05 to engage in actions of specific
types consistently over time,
167.95 where it can hold us back,
how to gain better perspective
171.46 and how to help others
gain better perspective so
174.67 that we can work better
with them and them with us.
177.92 We also go deep into the
likely scientific mechanisms
180.76 underlying why the tools
that Jocko teaches and uses
183.43 are so effective.
184.838 In fact, one thing that
you'll immediately notice
186.88 is that Jocko was
writing things down
188.62 and I was writing things down
throughout the conversation.
191.26 And that just reflects the
fact that he's not just
193.45 an immensely powerful
teacher, he's
195.82 also a practitioner
and an avid learner.
199.13 He's always seeking knowledge.
200.8 So we kick back
and forth our ideas
202.75 about what likely does and does
not underlie different tools
205.99 and techniques, focusing,
of course, mostly
209.02 on what works in the
practical sense in the world.
212.14 What I can assure you is that
by the end of today's episode,
215.66 thanks to Jocko's immense
generosity and curiosity,
219.52 you will come away with
a large number of tools
222.19 and much richer understanding
of how to navigate and enhance
225.91 mental health, physical
health and performance
228.49 in all aspects of life.
229.99 Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize
231.88 that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research
234.4 roles at Stanford.
235.45 It is, however, part
of my desire and effort
237.76 to bring zero cost to
consumer information
239.92 about science and
science-related tools
241.93 to the general public.
243.22 In keeping with
that theme, I'd like
244.72 to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast.
247.22 Our first sponsor is Maui Nui.
249.34 Maui Nui he is venison
that is by far the most
252.1 nutrient-dense and delicious
red meat commercially available.
255.49 Maui Nui he spent
nearly a decade
257.32 building a USDA-certified
wild harvesting system
260.709 to help balance invasive
deer populations
262.93 on the island of Maui.
264.28 The solution they built
turns the proliferation
266.53 of an otherwise invasive
species into a wide range
269.68 of nutrient-dense products, from
fresh butcher cuts and organ
273.01 meats to bone broth,
jerky, and even pet treats.
275.74 The quality and nutrient
value of Maui Nui meats
278.05 is extraordinary.
279.16 For instance, their bone broth
has an unmatched 25 grams
282.07 of protein per 100 calories.
284.11 As I've talked about with
guests and in solo episodes
286.36 of this podcast, getting
adequate protein intake,
288.94 and in particular,
high-quality protein intake,
291.31 is extremely important.
292.69 Current research
suggests that most people
294.46 should be getting
about 1 gram per pound
297.07 of body weight of
quality protein per day.
299.38 And Maui Nui meats are of
the absolute highest quality
302.62 in terms of the amino acid
profile and other nutrients
305.41 contained in their venison.
306.91 If you would like to
try Maui Nui venison,
308.92 go to

318.73 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep.
321.31 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating
324.16 and sleep tracking capacity.
326.08 I've discussed many times
before on this podcast
328.21 about the key importance
of temperature
330.55 in regulating the
quality of your sleep.
333.19 Put simply, in order to fall
asleep and stay deeply asleep
336.28 throughout the night,
your body temperature
338.17 has to drop by about
1 to 3 degrees.
340.33 And waking up, conversely,
involves your body temperature
343.72 increasing by about
1 to 3 degrees.
346.13 Now, people vary in their
core body temperature
348.28 and whether or not they
tend to run hot or cold
349.9 throughout the night.
350.8 But with Eight Sleep
mattresses and mattress covers,
353.38 you can literally program
in the exact temperature
356.23 that you want to sleep in.
357.88 And that allows you
to fall deeply asleep,
359.95 go into slow wave
sleep and REM sleep--
361.87 that is rapid eye movement
sleep-- in the exact sequence
364.6 that you need to in order to
have the best quality sleep
367.36 and it will even track
your sleep for you.
369.7 I've been sleeping with
an 8 sleep mattress cover
371.92 on my mattress for
about eight months now
374.29 and it is incredible.
375.91 My sleep was already pretty
good and now it is fantastic
378.64 and I feel so much
more alert and focused.
381.19 My mood is far better
throughout the day.
383.47 I thought I was optimized
and with Eight Sleep,
385.48 now I realize I
had a lot more room
388.45 to improve my sleep and
my daytime wakefulness.
390.915 If you'd like to
try Eight Sleep,
392.29 you can go to
eightsleep.com/huberman
394.51 and check out their Pod
Pro cover and save $150
397.93 at checkout.
398.74 Eight Sleep currently
ships in the USA, Canada,
401.0 UK, and selected countries
in the EU and Australia.
404.29 Again, that's
EightSleep.Com/Huberman to save
406.96 $150 at checkout.
408.73 Today's episode is also
brought to us by LMNT.
411.19 LMNT is an electrolyte drink
that has everything you need
413.95 and nothing you don't.
414.88 That means the exact ratios
of electrolytes are in LMNT,
418.39 and those are sodium,
magnesium, and potassium
421.24 but it has no sugar.
422.863 I've talked many times before on
this podcast about the key role
425.53 of hydration and electrolytes
for nerve cell function, neuron
430.095 function, as well
as the function
431.47 of all the cells
and all the tissues
433.27 and organ systems of the body.
435.25 If we have sodium, magnesium,
and potassium present
438.07 in the proper ratios, all of
those cells function properly
441.28 and all our bodily
systems can be optimized.
444.25 If the electrolytes
are not present
446.23 and if hydration
is low, we simply
448.57 can't think as well as we would
otherwise, our mood is off,
452.11 hormone systems go
off, our ability
453.88 to get into physical
action, to engage
455.95 in endurance and strength and
all sorts of other things,
458.44 is diminished.
459.62 So with LMNT, you can
make sure that you're
461.56 staying on top of your
hydration and that you're
463.75 getting the proper
ratios of electrolytes.
465.7 If you'd like to try LMNT,
you can go to DrinkLMNT--
468.13 that's L-M-N-T--
469.555 slash Huberman, and you'll
get a free LMNT sample
472.15 pack with your purchase.
473.35 And right now, LMNT
has two special flavors
475.45 for the holidays, chocolate
caramel and mint chocolate.
478.54 By the way, both of those
taste extremely good,
481.45 cold and, even better, I find,
heated up, believe it or not.
485.41 You can have them as kind
of a tea, they're delicious.
487.66 And all of their
flavors are delicious.
489.79 For the ones that you
drink typically cold,
492.28 I like the raspberry flavor
the watermelon flavor,
494.573 and frankly, I like the
citrus flavor as well.
496.49 They're all delicious.
497.407 So again, if you want to try
LMNT, you can go to LMNT,
499.75 drinklmnt.com/huberman.
502.15 The Huberman Lab
podcast is now partnered
503.92 with Momentous supplements.
505.12 To find the supplements we
discuss on the Huberman Lab
507.37 podcast, you can go to
livemomentous-- spelled O-U-S--
510.25 livemomentous.com/huberman.
512.52 And I should just
mention that the library
514.27 of those supplements is
constantly expanding.
516.4 Again, that's
livemomentous.com/huberman.
519.46 And now for my discussion
with Jocko Willink.
522.13 Jocko Willink, welcome.
523.522 JOCKO WILLINK: Thanks
for having me, man.
525.23 - I'm super excited and
super happy to have you here.
528.73 - I'm glad to be here.
530.84 I know that you and I did five
and 1/2 hours on my podcast.
535.09 So schedule is clear, let's go.
538.48 - Let's go.
539.23 And actually-- and people
will see the Jocko GO drinks.
542.38 This is not some sort
of promotional by me,
544.82 but these are the
energy drinks I drink.
546.94 So this could be called the
bring-your-own-GO podcast.
550.84 It is the energy drink I drink.
552.34 And no, I'm not
told to promote that
553.907 or paid to promote that, it's
just the one that I drink.
556.24 So there you go.
557.59 No pun intended.
559.365 I was just saying
to our producer
560.74 a moment ago that rarely
do I sit down and do
563.5 a podcast with somebody
that's skilled in podcasting.
566.83 Lex Fridman would
be the only person
568.33 that I've had on this
podcast, I believe,
570.038 who's also a podcaster.
571.172 Since you're a podcaster
and many other things,
573.13 I confess I'm a little
bit intimidated.
575.83 - Well, it's a weird thing
to actually call a skill.
579.55 Because it's something that
I just kind of started doing.
582.325 It's something that you
just kind of started doing.
584.45 It's something that Lex
just kind of started doing.
586.84 And I never practiced
it, I didn't
590.05 sit down before my first
podcast and think about how
594.66 I should deliver things.
595.66 I just kind of did it, so.
598.99 Maybe it's just luck
more than skill.
602.13 - Well, you and I
actually go back further
604.41 than that conversation that
we had on your podcast.
607.39 I think it might
have been 2014, 2015,
610.05 and you were on the
Tim Ferriss podcast.
612.36 And at the time I was
living with my girlfriend,
614.67 we had moved from San
Diego to the Bay Area.
616.65 We were living in this
little, tiny apartment
618.525 in a basement in Oakland,
trying to save up to buy a place
621.36 or rent a place that
was decent to live in.
624.6 And we both knew a
lot of team guys,
627.51 she knew more team guys
than I did in San Diego.
629.64 Had dated a few,
just to be direct.
632.28 Great woman, those guys
were cool to me, mostly.
635.58 And I remember when I saw
the photo on the top card
639.72 for Tim's podcast.
640.56 It was your face.
642.0 And I said, do you know
this guy from San Diego.
644.07 And she goes, nope.
645.54 But if you had to draw a Navy
SEAL, that's what you'd draw.
650.25 So I think for a
lot of people, you
652.99 embody their notion of a
number of different things,
655.93 some of which you talk about.
657.19 But some of which,
when you open up a bit
659.55 and really get specific
about work in the military
662.44 and work in daily life and what
it is to be you, but really,
665.58 what it is to be a human being,
some important contradictions
669.36 also emerge, right?
671.46 Obviously, discipline is a theme
that people associate with you,
675.25 right?
675.75 In my view and I think in
the view of a lot of people,
678.21 you embody discipline.
679.23 So today, I definitely want
to talk about routines,
682.24 but also mindsets.
683.97 But also things
that you do and ways
686.88 that you approach things that
might not contradict, but not
690.27 be so obvious to people.
691.71 Might be a little
bit counterintuitive.
693.86 And in addition to that, you
have a lot of different aspects
696.36 to your life.
696.78 In addition to
running businesses,
698.197 you're a family man,
you have children
700.05 and married a long time.
701.363 And so you have a
lot of knowledge
702.78 from different domains of life.
704.072 So with your permission, I'd
like to dive into all of them
706.74 over the next 26 hours.
708.36 - Let's dive.
709.74 - Great.
711.39 I'm fascinated by this
idea of sense of self.
715.02 I feel like all of us can look
back to a time early in life
717.87 when we first had
some experience.
721.29 Could be in art class,
could be fishing,
724.8 could be sport,
doesn't really matter
727.89 what the exact experience was.
729.64 But where we first realized
that there are really
732.96 cool things in the world.
734.16 Like something that turned us
on at the level of excitement.
737.79 Or maybe scared us, or
something like that.
740.11 Do you have any recollection
of such an event?
742.248 Maybe not the first
one, but you ever
743.79 remember hearing or seeing
something as a young kid,
746.52 and maybe you could tell us
how young, and just thinking,
749.4 yeah, more of that please.
751.23 [JOCKO CHUCKLES]
753.63 - A lot of times when
people ask questions
755.67 along this line of when
was there a moment--
758.903 when was there a moment
that you realized discipline
761.07 or when was there a moment
you realized leadership
763.153 or when was there a moment
you realized detachment,
766.16 kind of like your
question, when was there
767.91 a moment you realized, for lack
of a better way of saying it,
771.57 I'm a person.
773.64 I'm a person with
my own thoughts
775.77 and I can make things happen.
777.76 And for me, all those answers
are usually fairly gradual.
782.19 There's a little thing that
indicates, you get a clue
784.83 and then you move a little
bit further down that road.
786.63 Then you get another
clue and then
787.74 you move a little bit
further down that road
789.13 and you get another clue.
792.57 So that's what I
would say, for me,
795.78 life was like when
I was a little kid.
800.04 I was kind of slowly
discovering that I was a person,
806.65 I was a human.
810.13 I remember my mom
took me shopping.
814.09 I was probably
about 10 years old
816.13 and I needed to get
pants for school.
818.59 And my mom took me shopping.
822.16 And when I went into the store,
there was a girl that was--
827.5 I don't know what they're
called in a store.
829.78 A retail sales girl?
832.24 She was probably about 16.
834.88 And I started chatting her up.
837.73 And I kind of recognize
it a little bit
840.64 but I sort of didn't too and I
just was chatting to this girl
843.46 and I was making her laugh.
844.76 And I was having a good
time with the whole thing
846.802 and putting on the pants
and spinning around,
849.85 and she was laughing.
851.98 And I remember when we left
the store with the pants
856.0 and my mom was sort
of talking to me
859.18 about the fact that, "What were
you trying to do to that girl?"
862.12 And I was thinking to
myself, well, I kind of
865.81 liked that girl, she was pretty.
867.413 And I don't know why
that popped into my head.
869.33 But I just remember
thinking, hey man, there's
871.247 a whole world out there and
let's go make it happen.
874.735 - Yeah, it's a great story.
875.86 Because I think it really
speaks to this thing
878.23 that you mentioned, which
is that when we first
880.782 start to realize we
have a sense of self,
882.49 it has something to do with
cause and effect on the world,
884.907 like we can have an impact
in some way on things outside
888.85 of us, outside of our home.
890.74 Lately I've been reading
a lot of psychology
892.87 and I've been listening
to some of your content
894.828 and I definitely want to
talk to you about a study
897.04 that you covered
related to these--
899.38 it's a brutal experiment with
these kids that either had
902.47 stutter or didn't have stutter.
904.048 I want to get into that
a little bit later.
905.84 But what we do and
how we treat people
908.47 and how we receive feedback and
give feedback has a big impact.
912.56 But I think some of that happens
just in our own relationship
915.94 to things in the world.
916.99 The older Hungarian
psychologist, I'm learning,
919.33 had this idea of
two kinds of people.
921.37 They literally thought there
were two kinds of people.
923.62 There are generators
and projectors.
926.86 And generators are
people that are just--
929.41 from a very young
age, they realize
932.08 they can impact other people,
positively, negatively.
935.32 And they want to create
things in the world,
938.95 they want to generate stuff.
940.42 And they go wow, I can actually
build stuff and break stuff.
943.27 Blow stuff up, maybe,
but also help things.
946.492 And then there are
these projectors
947.95 that like to just
reflect on what they see.
952.08 And they made the really
important point, I think,
955.17 that it's not the generators
are good and projectors are bad.
958.2 The world needs both,
that they really work
960.48 in a kind of symbiotic way.
962.1 But your story
captures the essence
963.937 of what it is to be
a generator, which
965.52 is that by doing certain
things, you can have an impact.
967.99 And it feeds back to
you and it's likely
969.657 that they receive
something from it as well.
971.74 - Yeah.
972.24 And where this all came to
fruition, as I now piece
975.622 together as you're talking
through this stuff--
977.58 Look, when I joined the
military, you join the military
982.05 and you get a blank slate.
984.0 So no one cares
where you came from,
986.34 no one cares what you did.
987.72 You were the captain
of the football
989.432 team, captain of the
soccer team, no one cares.
991.39 No one cares what
your grades were,
992.848 no one cares what
you got on the SATs.
994.773 No one cares about anything.
995.94 You're a blank slate.
997.35 And then with that
blank slate, it is, hey,
1001.14 if you do this thing,
if you perform this task
1004.73 and you perform it well,
you will get recognition.
1010.1 You will hopefully
get more control
1012.89 over your own destiny, which
is the ultimate in compensation
1017.72 for human beings.
1019.04 To have more control
over your own destiny
1021.702 is the ultimate compensation.
1022.91 You and I were talking
before we hit record,
1025.31 you can have all the
money in the world,
1027.06 but if you don't
control what you're
1029.18 doing every day or
at least you don't
1031.369 control most of what you're
doing, then it's not worth it.
1033.93 The reason people
try and make money
1036.14 is so they can have more
autonomy in their life.
1039.39 And so in the military,
it becomes very clear--
1042.148 and it became very
clear to me very quickly
1043.94 that if I performed well, I
actually got a lot more freedom
1048.86 with what I did.
1049.85 Even in boot camp.
1051.23 If you pass an
inspection in boot camp,
1053.15 you don't have to
redo your locker
1055.102 or you don't have to make your
bed again because you did it
1057.56 right the first time.
1058.83 And so you have an
extra 15 minutes.
1060.87 And so for me,
really, that's when
1063.23 I started to realize, oh,
what I'm doing right now is it
1067.898 going to impact not
only what's going
1069.44 to happen to me
in the next hour,
1070.815 but in the next two years,
three years, five years.
1073.01 And I think that's the
biggest miss that we have
1075.53 when we're growing up.
1076.64 And I know you had your
challenges and tribulations
1079.22 as you were growing up because
you didn't realize, oh,
1081.47 what I'm doing right now
is going to affect where
1083.63 I'm going to be in the future.
1085.548 And it didn't happen until
you were out of high school,
1087.84 when you went to junior
college and you're like,
1089.24 oh wait a second, I can
actually put my life together
1091.67 in a positive way.
1092.78 When you're 14,
you're thinking, hey
1096.088 what am I going to do tomorrow.
1097.38 That's basically
future operations or--
1099.118 what am I going to do tomorrow.
1100.41 - Would've been far
ahead for me at 14.
1101.58 I was like, where am I going to
get the Slurpee, which curves
1104.4 am I going to hit
skateboarding and where are we
1106.41 going to play
video games tonight
1107.61 or what girls are we
going to hang out with.
1108.93 That was kind of
the mindset at 14.
1110.388 - Yeah.
1110.888 And then at some point,
you learned, and so did I,
1113.01 oh, the actions that
I take now are either
1117.15 going to positively
impact my future
1118.66 or they're to negatively
impact my future.
1120.41 And the more I focused
on doing things
1124.203 that are going to
positively impact my future,
1126.12 the better my life became.
1128.25 And I think that's
a very huge lesson
1131.28 to learn that I know I didn't
figure out for quite some time.
1135.33 - Yeah the idea of
investments and withdrawals,
1139.53 or understanding
that early in life
1141.45 in terms of health behaviors
and intellectual behaviors.
1144.06 And your point
about the military
1145.59 is a really interesting
one, I never
1147.09 thought about the
military that way,
1148.59 that there's this blank
slate when you get in there.
1151.08 And before we started, we
were talking a little bit
1153.72 about the kinds of
mindsets and people
1156.0 that the military attracts.
1157.77 And I'd love for you to
elaborate on that again.
1160.02 You mentioned
something interesting,
1161.52 this notion of garrison.
1163.8 - Interesting word
in its own right.
1166.788 What kind of people do you
think the military attracts?
1169.08 And then within the
military, do you
1170.88 start to see some kind of
predictable bifurcations, where
1173.82 certain people go down
one track and other people
1176.31 go down another?
1177.12 I have a few friends from the
SEAL teams, as we both know.
1179.7 And I've heard sometimes
about the distinction
1181.77 between officers and enlisted
guys, this kind of thing.
1185.1 But maybe this
question I'm asking
1188.19 is more across the board
for all of military.
1190.8 And for people
listening, whether or not
1194.37 they are interested in military
or not for their own life,
1197.92 I think there's an interesting
lesson, this idea of who
1200.49 is attracted to the military.
1201.85 Is it like people who want to
instill order on themselves
1204.63 or is it people who want to
instill order on other people,
1207.28 or both?
1207.99 - Yeah.
1209.22 There's a really good
book and I ended up
1211.95 doing about four podcasts
on this book, which
1214.65 is called The Psychology
of Military Incompetence.
1217.785 And when I first saw that--
1218.91 - What an amazing title.
1219.93 - I know.
1220.43 And when I first saw that
title, I thought to myself,
1222.9 oh, this is some academic that's
going to look at the military
1227.46 and bash it.
1229.59 But I did a little
research and it turned out
1231.63 that the guy that had
written the book--
1232.8 I can't think of
his name right now--
1234.342 he was a guy that had served
in World War II, was wounded.
1236.94 I mean, this guy understood
what he was talking about.
1240.25 And it's really
an obvious concept
1242.14 once you think about it.
1243.6 The basic premise is
this, the military,
1247.24 when you look at it
from the outside,
1249.55 it's this orderly place.
1252.05 It's a place where
everything has a place.
1255.86 It's a place where if you have
a certain rank on your shoulder,
1258.97 you will command respect and
people have to listen to you.
1263.11 That's what it looks like.
1265.61 So it's an attractive
place for people
1268.18 that have an authoritarian
mindset, for people that
1271.6 want to just, hey, don't
question what I'm saying,
1274.59 just shut up and do
what I tell you to do.
1276.34 There's people that love that.
1277.51 There's people that
want to live like that.
1278.95 You've worked for them,
I've worked for them.
1280.84 We've experienced those type
of people throughout our lives.
1284.62 That authoritarian
mindset that just
1286.9 want to bark orders and
have people listen to them.
1289.88 And so when those people are
14 years old or 16 years old
1293.95 or 18 years old, they
look at the military
1295.72 and they see a uniform.
1297.22 And they see people
saluting and they
1299.29 see orders being carried out.
1300.91 And they think, that's
where I'm going to go.
1302.83 And I can get the
respect that I deserve.
1306.25 And the military certainly
attracts people like that.
1309.44 And those people that have that
highly-disciplined and orderly
1316.7 mindset can do well
inside the military,
1320.46 especially in garrison.
1322.885 Again, we were talking
about this earlier, the word
1325.01 garrison.
1325.52 I don't think there's a civilian
equivalent to this word,
1328.34 but it basically means
the noncombat situation.
1331.35 So when you're out
on the parade field,
1333.83 when you're going
through schooling where
1338.49 there's no combat involved,
when you're marching.
1341.34 Those kind of things,
we call that garrison.
1344.31 It's in the rear.
1345.03 It's not in combat.
1346.437 And the people with an
authoritarian mindset
1348.27 actually do pretty well
in garrison situations.
1351.22 Why?
1351.72 Because things are orderly
and you can predict what's
1354.563 going to happen.
1355.23 And you do get a
certain issue of gear
1357.36 and that gear is going
to be delivered on time
1359.962 and you're going to shoot
this number of rounds
1361.92 down at the range.
1362.7 And everything is going
to go according to plan,
1365.16 that's what garrison is.
1368.23 And so those people
join the military,
1369.962 they're attracted to
that and they end up
1371.67 doing well in peacetime.
1374.96 Now unfortunately for them,
combat is a lot different.
1379.55 Nothing goes the way
it's supposed to go.
1381.89 The bullets don't get
delivered on time,
1384.08 the enemy has a vote on the
way things are going to unfold.
1386.99 And you end up in combat being
in very chaotic situations.
1390.48 So the type of person
that thrives in combat
1395.85 has a more open mind,
has a more flexible mind,
1398.8 is paying more
attention to the input
1402.31 that they're receiving
as opposed to someone
1404.18 with an authoritarian mindset.
1405.43 They don't listen
to anybody else.
1406.847 They make up their own
mind, they bark orders.
1409.12 With someone that has
a more open mindset,
1411.4 they're listening,
they're taking input,
1413.92 they're evolving their plan.
1416.62 And those type of people
excel in a combat situation.
1420.13 Now unfortunately, and this is
sort of the stereotype too, you
1423.22 take that dog of war
and you put him back
1428.17 into a garrison environment,
he doesn't do well.
1430.42 He's not showing up on
time for the inspection,
1434.47 didn't get his haircut, he
doesn't have his weapon cleaned
1436.887 the way it's supposed to
be cleaned because he's
1438.887 got his weapon ready for combat,
not ready for inspection.
1441.58 And so you get this-- there
are these two different types
1444.92 of people.
1445.42 And of course, with those two
different types of people,
1447.753 there's degrees going
one direction or other.
1449.98 But what you hope
for is someone that
1453.79 can play the game
on the garrison side
1456.52 and yet when it comes
time to go into combat,
1459.28 they can also open their mind,
be flexible, be creative.
1463.87 That's what you really want
is you want someone that is
1466.45 very good at solving problems.
1468.613 And to do that, you need to have
a creative, open mind to figure
1471.28 out how we're going to
deal with something.
1473.072 So I think that's
the stereotype.
1474.722 The stereotype is that
everyone in the military
1476.68 is sort of robotic and
falling into the hierarchy,
1481.0 and we bark orders and
people follow orders.
1483.37 And that's just not true.
1485.963 There is an element
of truth to it
1487.38 but it's not the whole truth.
1488.8 And certainly, if you look at
it history, the people that
1493.44 excel in combat are the
people that maybe have
1496.2 a little bit of a
rebellious streak,
1497.7 people that are just more
creative and more open minded.
1501.54 - Some of my friends
from the SEAL teams
1504.06 will sometimes throw
out stereotypes
1506.37 about the different
divisions in the military.
1508.56 Is there any truth to this
idea that Air Force types are
1512.37 one way and Marines are one
way and Navy is one way,
1516.42 army is a certain way?
1517.59 Sort of a general
contour of personality
1520.08 or is that just kind of
inside ball, joking around?
1522.48 - It's a little bit of both.
1523.78 I mean certainly, the Marine
Corps is steeped in tradition.
1528.33 And if you make a guess
at what a marine--
1533.67 if you had to guess what a
marine is going to be like,
1536.52 you're probably going
to be pretty close.
1539.1 Marines have an
incredible program
1541.89 to indoctrinate their people
into the culture of the Marine
1545.65 Corps.
1546.15 And the Marine Corps has an
incredibly strong culture.
1547.77 It's a powerful culture.
1549.04 I love the Marine Corps, I've
worked with the Marine Corps
1551.457 a ton and they're outstanding.
1552.75 As a generality, certainly you
could make those assumptions
1555.69 about the Marines in general.
1556.898 Now, does that mean that
every Marine is the same?
1558.982 No, absolutely not.
1559.867 Same thing with the army,
same thing with the Air Force,
1562.2 same thing with the Navy.
1563.25 You've got these
kind of stereotypes
1565.08 that exist for a reason.
1567.12 It's interesting too.
1568.02 One of my friends
named Ben Milligan
1569.94 wrote an incredible
book called By Water
1572.97 Beneath the Walls,
which I've given him
1574.92 a huge hassle about because it's
the worst title of all time.
1577.62 But it's certainly
the best book written
1580.35 about the SEAL teams'
history and where
1583.86 the SEAL teams came from.
1585.61 And it's interesting,
it's something
1587.13 that I had heard from
a SEAL officer that
1590.82 had given a speech years ago
at his change of command.
1593.55 And what he said
was he was trying
1596.34 to emphasize why the
SEAL teams were good.
1600.16 And one of the things he
said was in the army--
1603.44 and he was talking
historically-- he goes,
1605.19 hey, in the army, if you
start to lose a battle,
1607.92 you can just retreat
and run away.
1610.41 In the Navy, traditionally,
we're fighting on board a ship.
1614.22 And if that ship--
1615.78 we can't run away.
1616.68 We're fighting and
if we lose, we die.
1618.9 So SEALS can't quit.
1620.61 It was this, a little
over the top, expression.
1625.08 But when you take that
a little bit further,
1627.48 when you look at the
history of the Navy.
1630.12 If we were in the
Navy 150 years ago,
1633.73 you would have to
go on deployment.
1636.27 You would take your ship
and you would sail somewhere
1638.572 and you wouldn't be able
to talk to me anymore.
1640.53 So you would have
to understand what
1642.312 it is you were
trying to accomplish
1643.77 and then just go out
there and make it happen.
1645.687 That's decentralized command.
1647.76 And that's something that
exists in the SEAL teams
1650.31 without question, very
decentralized command.
1653.49 And that's one of the absolute
strengths of the SEAL teams
1656.94 is you've got leaders at every
level inside the organization.
1660.54 That if they don't
know exactly--
1662.213 if they're not told what
to do, they're going to go,
1664.38 OK, I haven't been
told what to do
1665.97 but I'm going to
go figure it out.
1667.387 And that's one of the
strengths of the SEAL teams.
1671.01 We have more doctrine now, but
when I came in the SEAL teams,
1674.07 there was no doctrine.
1675.87 It was all word of mouth.
1677.49 And so the army and
the Marine Corps,
1679.83 if you have to
conduct an ambush,
1683.16 you can pull out
a manual and you
1685.23 can look up how to conduct
an ambush-- platoon ambush,
1687.48 how to conduct it-- and
it's all written very clear.
1689.52 And they're great documents.
1690.79 That's the FM 7-8 infantry
platoon and squad,
1694.26 I think is the army doctrine.
1695.845 - I can see the little neurons
in your hippocampus firing
1698.22 in sequence.
1698.5 - Yeah.
1698.72 - It's embedded
in there forever.
1700.14 - And it's a great manual.
1702.36 And you can pull that
thing out and you
1704.13 have a place to start from.
1705.33 In the SEAL teams, we
didn't have that at all.
1707.59 So you would hear from
your platoon chief,
1710.46 this is how you
conduct an ambush.
1711.99 And he had heard it from his
platoon chief, who heard it
1713.94 from his platoon
chief, who heard it
1715.38 from his platoon chief, and that
platoon chief was in Vietnam.
1717.963 So it's getting passed down but
you can make adjustments to it.
1721.26 And you can alter the plan
a little bit because hey,
1725.79 the terrain is
different, or hey,
1727.32 the night vision we now have.
1729.87 So there's changes
that we can make
1731.46 because there's no doctrine.
1733.88 So not having any doctrine,
in many ways, is a strength.
1737.39 Also it can be a weakness.
1739.4 Because if you've got a new
platoon commander that's never
1742.43 done an ambush before and he
has no idea what he's doing,
1745.86 this platoon chief has been
out of the loop for a long time
1748.4 and he doesn't know what he's
doing, there's no reference.
1751.25 So there's strengths
and weaknesses,
1752.93 just like any characteristic.
1754.16 Everybody's characteristics,
you've got strength
1755.72 and you've got weaknesses.
1756.77 And your weaknesses
can be strengths
1758.3 and your strength
can be weaknesses.
1760.4 To get back to your
original question,
1763.25 are there stereotypes inside of
each of the military branches?
1766.4 Sure.
1767.21 But are there outliers in
each of the military branches?
1769.635 There are absolutely.
1770.51 And that's why you can't
judge a book by its cover.
1774.29 - For people listening to this
who are not in the military,
1778.13 maybe have some military
lineage in their family
1780.83 or not, but who want to
understand a little bit better
1783.8 about how structure
and lack of structure
1786.8 can both support being
effective in life,
1790.86 in relationships, in daily
life, in fitness, in business,
1796.58 in school--
1797.192 I think those are
the big domains--
1798.65 in creative endeavors.
1800.117 I think it would be useful for
them to understand a little bit
1802.7 about how you in particular
balance discipline
1806.99 and structure with,
dare I say, lack
1809.27 of discipline and structure.
1810.89 - Well, you could
actually just say
1812.348 the word freedom, because
that's what it turns into.
1814.7 - Or maybe even play.
1816.23 I bring this up in
part because I've
1818.42 seen some posts that you put
up of you playing the guitar
1820.91 with friends or music.
1822.17 One of them was a
tribute to someone
1823.88 who either was killed in
combat or had passed away.
1827.03 So these moments of
connection between people
1829.01 sometimes are working
together, but sometimes
1831.68 are in relaxation and play,
in these kinds of things.
1834.04 I think it was a really
important post for people
1836.082 to see that while Jocko Willink
kicks back with a guitar,
1838.91 not trying to take over stages--
1840.56 maybe you are.
1841.43 Maybe you have a plan.
1842.36 If anyone could do it,
you'd probably be the one.
1844.73 But what is the balance for
you in terms of structure
1849.53 and lack of structure?
1850.57 And I'm not going to ask
for your daily routine.
1852.57 We know that you get
up early, you train.
1854.06 But I do have some
specific questions
1855.602 that I think would be
helpful in putting some meat
1857.78 on the notions about you.
1860.528 And again, this isn't
a pick into your life
1862.32 but more to grab-- well,
it's to pick into your life.
1864.71 The-- so a question I
asked you in the lobby
1867.56 because it's one
that having seen
1869.403 your content for a long time
and really benefited from it,
1871.82 I was curious.
1872.84 You get up early
at about 4:30, you
1875.48 train every morning, how
long do you train for?
1879.56 And is there any global
structure to that?
1881.317 And, of course, everyone
needs different programs,
1883.4 but is it like weight
training one day,
1885.398 cardio training the next day,
or you're combining them?
1887.69 Is it always an hour or
is it always half an hour?
1889.64 I think people would benefit
from getting a little bit
1891.77 more understanding of what
that looks like for you,
1893.9 with the caveat that
everyone has different needs
1896.12 levels of background,
et cetera, but I'm
1899.09 intensely curious
about this and I'm
1900.68 certain I'm not the only one.
1902.01 JOCKO WILLINK: So do you want
to talk about weightlifting
1903.35 or rock and roll on the guitar?
1905.37 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
want to talk about--
1907.16 let's your let's talk about
the most structured first part
1910.13 of your day, and then let's talk
about the least structured part
1912.14 of your day, at least
the part that you
1913.765 can share with the world.
1915.35 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,
waking up early
1917.66 and I'm going to work out.
1919.38 And depending on what's
going on that day,
1922.43 if I have an early
flight, I might work out
1925.04 for eight minutes.
1927.71 I might go in and do
2,000 meters on the rower,
1930.62 get a sweat going as hard
as I can, and then I'm done,
1933.077 and-- because I've got
to go catch a flight.
1934.91 So that could be happening.
1937.01 Maybe I'm supposed to go surfing
in the morning, I wake up,
1940.25 the waves are terrible, and
so now I've got nothing to do.
1943.1 I planned out to be surfing
for two or three hours,
1946.4 and now I'm not
going to go surfing,
1947.93 so I'm going to go lift and
I'm going to go play in the gym
1950.39 and do a bunch of stuff.
1951.2 I'm going to spend two
or three hours in there.
1953.158 I love doing that.
1954.9 So the workout could be
anywhere between what
1957.98 I just say 8
minutes and 3 hours,
1960.05 and it could be
anything in between.
1962.1 I fully enjoy the physical
aspect of working out.
1967.32 So if I have more time to spend
in the gym, I'll spend it.
1972.0 I remember my dad
saying at one point,
1974.1 if I retired I wouldn't
know what to do.
1977.28 And I was thinking to myself,
are you serious right now?
1980.16 If I didn't have anything to
do, I'd spend six hours a day
1982.77 in the gym, I'd spend four hours
doing jiu-jitsu I could fill
1986.13 my day--
1986.7 I could fill every day with
just physical activity, things
1990.39 that I just like doing.
1992.67 So wake up early,
get a sweat going.
1995.52 And do I lift?
1997.23 Yes.
1997.86 Do I do cardio?
1999.46 Yes.
1999.96 Do I run?
2000.62 Yes.
2000.89 Do I sprint?
2001.46 Yes.
2001.96 Do I lift heavy weights?
2003.18 Yes.
2003.68 Do I swing kettlebells?
2004.61 Yes.
2005.11 I do everything and anything,
and I enjoy all of it,
2009.17 and I'm not really
good at any of it.
2010.97 I'm not really good at any one
aspect of physical activity.
2018.08 There's people that are
infinitely better at me
2020.48 in every aspect,
and I'm not just
2022.67 talking about, Oh, this
guy's a world-class, no.
2024.68 There's like a guy named
Fred down at the gym that can
2027.38 deadlift more than
me, there was a guy--
2029.06 when I was at SEAL Team 2,
there was a guy who was,
2032.46 it's probably 5'7", and
he looked kind of chubby,
2036.81 and he was older than me, and
he could run faster than me,
2040.697 and he could bench more than me.
2042.03 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those
guys are out there.
2043.26 JOCKO WILLINK: It was
just so bothersome.
2045.062 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
they're out there.
2046.77 They've got some engine in
there related to something.
2049.255 I mean, I do think there are
genetic differences in terms
2051.63 of people's resilience
and workout,
2053.639 but even just grip
strength is highly, highly
2056.82 subject to like
genetic influences,
2058.44 maximum grip strength.
2059.531 But of course,
there's a huge range
2060.989 in what people can develop.
2062.73 But I guarantee your grip
strength is greater than mine.
2066.33 People ask me this
all the time, who
2067.83 would win in arm wrestling
between you and Jocko.
2071.386 JOCKO WILLINK: You know
there's a lot of technique
2073.469 in arm wrestling.
2074.302 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I have to imagine
2075.719 they're putting
their body behind it,
2076.8 they're putting
their back in that.
2078.179 JOCKO WILLINK: There's
a legitimate technique
2080.13 in arm wrestling--
2081.33 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which
worked for me yet.
2083.04 JOCKO WILLINK: No, if we could
bring a female arm wrestler
2085.77 in here that knows how to arm
wrestle, because I don't know
2088.228 how to arm wrestle either,
and she would beat both of us
2090.929 because there's a lot more
technique in arm wrestling
2093.87 than most people recognize.
2096.788 There's all these little
games that are going on.
2098.83 There's all this little
arm position that you get.
2100.99 So just like everything
else, it's technique.
2103.527 There's a lot of technique
in arm wrestling.
2105.36 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's good to know.
2105.93 I didn't know that
about arm wrestling.
2107.555 I think we all start off with
some genetic predispositions,
2110.76 both good and bad, for different
things, and then there's--
2113.79 as far as we know,
there's a huge range
2115.68 based through neuroplasticity
and muscle adaptation,
2118.14 et cetera, in what
we can obtain.
2119.86 So I never want
genetic predisposition
2121.77 to serve as a barrier.
2123.03 No one knows also what the upper
limits of any of these things
2125.67 are.
2126.21 And some of the best examples
we know from sport and certainly
2128.793 from academia are
people who knew
2130.8 they were at a
disadvantage and just
2132.42 worked 10 times harder
than everybody else
2134.28 because they had
an ax to grind with
2135.78 their genetic
disadvantage, which is
2137.64 really cool at the face of it.
2139.44 I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge
2141.69 one of our sponsors,
Athletic Greens.
2143.85 Athletic Greens, now called AG1
is a vitamin mineral probiotic
2148.2 drink that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs.
2151.53 I've been taking Athletic
Green since 2012,
2154.29 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast.
2156.57 The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason
2158.987 I still take Athletic Greens
once or usually twice a day
2162.06 is that it gets
me the probiotics
2164.16 that I need for gut health.
2165.81 Our gut is very important.
2166.95 It's populated by
gut microbiota that
2169.46 communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically
2171.96 all the biological
systems of our body
2173.67 to strongly impact our
immediate and long term health.
2177.21 And those probiotics
in Athletic Greens
2179.16 are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health.
2182.92 In addition, Athletic
Greens contains
2184.56 a number of adaptogens
vitamins and minerals
2186.48 that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs
2189.09 are met, and it tastes great.
2191.718 If you'd like to
try Athletic Greens,
2193.26 you can go to
athleticgreens.com/huberman,
2196.44 and they'll give you five
free travel packs that make it
2199.02 really easy to mix up Athletic
Greens while you're on the road
2201.78 in the car, on the
plane, et cetera,
2203.34 and they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3/K2.
2206.94 Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman
2209.52 to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply
2212.13 of vitamin D3/K2.
2213.84 So you get the training, and
do you track your training
2216.6 in a detailed way?
2217.89 Are you keeping
track of lists and--
2219.63 JOCKO WILLINK: So I
write down what I do,
2221.338 and I'll write down--
2222.63 I write down what
I do every day.
2224.23 And that way, I can
go back and say,
2225.93 what was I doing back then?
2227.07 Because I might go
through some phase
2228.72 where I'm trying
to do more pull ups
2230.28 or I'm trying to deadlift
more and I'm trying--
2232.38 whatever the thing
is, I'll go back
2235.957 into-- because I get bored
of deadlifting after a while.
2238.29 And let's face it, if you just
want to be a good deadlifter,
2241.17 you're not going
to be that fast.
2243.09 You're going to be
slow on long runs,
2246.437 so you don't want to go
too deep into deadlifting.
2248.52 And you also don't want
to be so good at long runs
2250.71 that you can't deadlift
a good amount of weight.
2254.02 So I kind of go through
phases, and I'll
2256.2 get into something
for a while, and then
2257.28 I'll get into something else.
2258.25 So I do log down what I'm doing
so that way I can look back
2260.708 and say, Oh, dang, I'm not
even close to as strong
2263.94 as I used to be, need
to get back to that.
2266.585 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm fascinated
by the concept of energy.
2268.96 I think it's one of the most
interesting aspects in all
2270.88 of biology, all of
psychology, and all of life.
2272.96 And when I say energy,
I mean the distinction
2276.37 between being back
on your heels,
2278.2 flat footed, or
forward center of mass.
2280.81 And I get the
impression, and I think
2283.193 everyone gets the
impression that you're
2284.86 somebody with a lot of energy,
and I wonder whether or not
2288.64 you wake up with a
lot of energy and you
2291.25 feel like you have to burn it
off with this physical activity
2294.13 and work and other
demands in your life,
2297.02 or do you find that you
wake up and your energy
2299.83 is kind of neutral, and
exercise and physical activity
2303.07 gives you energy?
2304.48 Because I think this is one
of the key things out there,
2307.92 I think, that acts as
a barrier for people
2309.67 doing more with their
body because maybe they
2312.435 don't want to tire
themselves out
2313.81 or maybe they don't feel
like they have enough energy
2316.018 to begin with.
2317.29 It's also feeds into this
idea that some people just
2320.53 have a lot of energy.
2321.59 They're really physical,
and other people aren't.
2323.632 So let's just say
on most days do
2326.71 you wake up feeling
like you want
2328.9 to burn off energy,
build energy, what
2331.48 is exercise mean to you?
2332.56 And then maybe we
can talk about some
2333.58 of the underlying stuff going
on there because I think we
2335.955 both might find it interesting.
2337.39 JOCKO WILLINK: I
would say it's both.
2339.17 There's no way I could sit
here and say, oh, yeah,
2341.253 every day that alarm
clock goes off,
2343.28 and I'm like, oh, yeah,
let's rock and roll.
2345.34 No, certainly
that's not the case.
2346.905 It's also certainly not
the case that every day I'm
2349.03 like, oh, god, not again.
2350.41 No, I'd say most of the time
the alarm clock goes off,
2353.75 and I don't think a bunch.
2356.14 When my alarm clock goes
off, I don't think a bunch.
2358.99 I don't debate with myself.
2360.49 I'm not negotiating.
2362.47 The thing goes off, and I'm
doing what I'm supposed to do.
2365.44 Sort of robotic.
2366.88 Now this much I can say,
when you go and work out,
2370.003 you're going to feel better.
2371.17 You will get energy
from working out.
2373.51 That is a guarantee.
2375.59 If you go work out, you're
going to feel better.
2377.59 If you go break a sweat,
you're going to feel better.
2379.64 You're going to get
more energy from it.
2381.307 And look, you got
to go really, really
2383.83 hard to where now you feel
more tired when you're done.
2389.38 And even that, I mean,
you've got to go psycho.
2391.93 I'll do that occasionally, but I
don't do that on a daily basis.
2395.11 At the end of the day, if
I wake up, lift, run, surf,
2401.47 and then I do jiu-jitsu
in the afternoon,
2403.63 at the end of that day,
I'm tired and I feel tired.
2409.04 But normal day working out
just makes you feel better.
2412.857 Definitely gives you--
definitely gives me energy,
2414.94 I should say, because I
guess I'm not everybody.
2416.94 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I think
it's a very important point
2419.62 because one of the things that
we are learning from circadian
2422.59 biology, time of day effects
and sunlight and all that stuff
2425.68 that we talk about
in our podcast
2427.09 that you've done
intuitively, this
2428.522 is what we kind of arrive to.
2429.73 JOCKO WILLINK:
It's kind of crazy.
2430.43 ANDREW HUBERMAN: As last
time we had a conversation
2431.8 is that so many of the
things that science
2433.55 is telling us to do
and that we emphasize
2435.76 on this podcast
you've been doing
2438.292 or are built into military
schedules, and one of them
2440.5 is this notion of
waking up early
2442.12 and getting physical
early in the day.
2444.43 And I suppose if we were
to just throw one blanket
2447.07 rule on the table to encompass
the broadest number of themes
2451.39 it's that once every 24
hours, we each and all
2456.22 get a big increase in this
release of the hormone
2458.65 cortisol, which everyone says,
oh, cortisol it's terrible,
2461.48 he's going to burn you
out, adrenal burnout, all
2463.48 that stuff, but it's
a non-negotiable peak.
2466.93 And you want it to arrive
early in the day and viewing
2470.83 sunlight, physical
activity, caffeine,
2473.83 and in particular
intense exercise,
2476.59 all amplify that cortisol peak.
2479.35 In fact, I think the
numbers I'm seeing
2481.09 is just sunlight
viewing gives you
2483.28 a 50% increase in that cortisol.
2485.56 Exercise on top of that,
another 50% to 75% increase.
2488.56 So this huge release in this
hormone that everyone thinks
2490.99 is terrible but actually
sets this huge wave
2493.36 in motion for the rest of
the day, which gives you
2496.4 more energy, higher levels of
immune function, more focus,
2500.21 et cetera, and does
indeed as you mentioned
2502.04 in your example of
your daily life sets
2503.87 a timer so that about 14 to
16 hours later, you're sleepy,
2507.38 which is what you want 14 to 68
hours later, unless, of course,
2510.23 you're running vampire
shifts in the military
2512.192 or you're on shift work, but
most people aren't, of course.
2514.65 So I think the idea that
movement and exercise gives us
2518.24 energy I think is an important
idea and it's something
2520.85 that frankly I was hoping
your answer would be that, as
2524.18 opposed to that you
wake up every day
2527.03 and you just want to just attack
the world because you have
2529.963 so much energy getting out
of bed because frankly, I
2532.13 never feel that way.
2533.24 But I always feel
better after I train.
2535.46 Always.
2536.27 And of course,
there are times when
2537.92 I crash in the early afternoon
if I train really, really hard,
2541.61 but usually that's
when I over-caffeinated
2545.0 to an outrageous degree, and
then I don't nourish after,
2548.75 or I over nourish.
2550.16 So this is the other thing
that eating, the whole rest
2553.04 and digesting, the digest
word in there is meant to--
2556.25 it's there for a
reason, which is
2557.66 that when we eat
a really big meal,
2559.22 we actually need to slow down.
2561.05 So I hate to get
into daily schedules
2563.242 at the level of
nitpicking, and nutrition
2564.95 is about the most controversial
topic on the internet,
2569.0 but do you nourish
after you train?
2572.46 And if you do, do you
do it to the point
2575.06 where you're kind of like, OK,
I'm mostly full or I'm full?
2578.22 Are you trying to
really nourish yourself,
2580.19 or do you find that
eating slows you down?
2582.57 JOCKO WILLINK: I find
that eating slows me down.
2584.57 And I would say, again, it's
weird how some of this stuff
2588.68 is.
2589.34 The main reason I got in
the habit of waking up early
2591.548 and working out is
because if you do it
2593.228 before anyone else is awake,
then they can't bother you
2595.52 and you can get stuff done.
2596.63 You go to the SEAL
Team and you get
2598.1 there before anyone else is
there, no one can say, hey,
2600.45 can you help us with this?
2601.1 Hey, no one sent you an email.
2602.35 So you get that time, you
get it done, and it's yours.
2606.05 I remember when you
were on my podcast,
2608.07 and I don't wear sunglasses
when I run in the morning
2611.75 because I sweat and it
fills my sunglasses.
2613.97 It's not because I want to
let the UV light into my eyes,
2617.69 that's not cortisol.
2618.767 It's not for the cortisol.
2619.85 I didn't know that.
2620.642 It's cool that I know it
now, but I just did it
2623.84 because I don't like to
sweat in my sunglasses,
2626.87 can't see, so I just run
without, I don't put a hat on.
2629.78 As far as eating, I don't like
to do physically active things
2634.04 with food in my stomach.
2636.59 That's just the way it is.
2637.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, me either.
2638.27 JOCKO WILLINK: And
so I don't want it.
2639.98 And what really
keeps that in line
2641.69 for me is I'm doing
jiu-jitsu in the afternoon,
2643.94 and so if I'm
eating a big lunch,
2646.16 by the time the afternoon
rolls around, I'm kind of I
2649.358 got food in my gut, and I
just don't like that feeling.
2651.65 So no, I don't eat
a big meal until I'm
2654.698 kind of done with the physical
stuff for the day, which
2656.99 is usually at night,
6, 7 o'clock at night,
2659.107 which I guess there's some
bad things about that I
2661.19 eat too late.
2662.03 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
the data say if you're--
2664.88 yeah, we could go down
a rabbit hole with this
2667.04 and then someone's
going to pull up
2668.12 some little clinical
study and then another one
2669.86 that counters that.
2670.76 I mean I think the
data essentially
2672.26 say that having a regular
meal schedule that
2675.59 allows you to sleep well at
night, whatever that means
2677.9 for you, and that allows you
to be active and focused when
2680.84 you need to be
active and focused,
2682.34 that's the ideal schedule.
2684.08 JOCKO WILLINK: When I'm
working with clients,
2686.448 so I have a leadership
consulting company Echelon
2688.49 Front.
2688.73 When I'm going to
work with a client,
2689.85 I'm not eating because
they're going to be asking me
2692.12 questions, we're going
to be diving into what's
2693.77 happening inside their
business, there's
2695.12 a lot of stuff going on.
2696.12 It's a lot of cognitive work.
2697.52 So I'm not eating
before a podcast.
2699.62 I'm not eating before a podcast.
2701.21 Before I'm recording
a podcast, I'm
2702.23 not eating because
I don't want to have
2703.67 a bunch of food in my stomach.
2704.96 You get a certain
level of mental clarity
2707.36 when you haven't
eaten a bunch of food.
2709.25 So going out on
missions, I never
2711.435 would eat before I
go out on a mission.
2713.06 I would eat when I come home.
2714.712 You get home at 4
o'clock in the morning,
2716.42 3 o'clock in the morning
from doing operation, cool,
2718.04 then I'll eat because
then I'm going
2719.96 to do a debrief for 15
minutes, clean weapons,
2722.87 and then eat a big
meal, go to sleep.
2725.6 Cool.
2726.485 Yeah, I don't want to
have food in my stomach
2728.36 when I've got to perform
or execute anything.
2731.58 So again, I think that's
just kind of a fluke
2734.84 that I ended up
living like that,
2736.49 but that's kind of how I live.
2738.2 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
a fortunate fluke
2739.825 for all of us because so
much of what you embody
2743.33 and what you do I think centers
around this idea of discipline,
2746.24 of course, but also energy.
2747.95 It's the intuitive sense I
get about why people are so
2752.06 drawn to your messaging and
what you do and how you do it.
2757.52 Energy we know, of
course, is caloric energy.
2759.912 And I think that's what
most people default to.
2761.87 They go, oh, how many
calories are energy
2764.425 and how many calories in
that and you need calories
2766.55 to fuel things.
2767.39 But the energy that
you're describing I think
2770.09 is the one that--
2771.14 well, it really maps the
Eastern traditions more directly
2773.94 to how yin and yang thing--
2775.37 yin and yang, I always
get that wrong-- so which
2777.83 is the notion of neural energy.
2779.99 And so there's a particular
cluster of chemicals in us
2783.92 as a fancy name called
the catecholamines.
2786.0 But that's dopamine,
epinephrine,
2787.98 which is adrenaline
and norepinephrine,
2789.74 and then you've got cortisol.
2791.84 And those four hang out
together and basically give us
2795.11 enough energy to run our
brain and body for 50 days.
2799.73 50 days.
2800.517 So the idea that you have to
eat before you train, sure,
2802.85 for some people that might
work better than others,
2804.93 but I think what
people don't realize
2806.472 is that anytime we're
taking in caloric energy,
2809.54 it takes neural energy in
order to digest that and put it
2813.17 into storage.
2814.01 And so the way you
describe your day of, yeah,
2815.96 I also don't eat before I train.
2817.293 I like to hydrate
and caffeinate.
2819.05 I have been drinking
these before I train.
2821.09 I have to limit myself to two
before because otherwise, I'm
2823.73 like picking up--
2824.438 I'm already quaking a little
bit at the second one.
2827.36 But I have a pretty
high caffeine tolerance.
2829.62 So I like to train first also.
2831.65 And then I find it
gives me energy.
2833.31 But then the moment that I eat a
meal that's a little too large,
2836.57 all of a sudden
I'm out of energy.
2838.197 And what's the deal?
2839.03 These calories
are energy, right?
2840.29 You're supposed to have energy
in order to think and move.
2842.04 And I think I think a lot of
the world has this backwards.
2844.5 And this isn't a push
for intermittent fasting
2846.68 or any particular
style of eating really,
2849.095 I don't care if people
are carnivores, vegan,
2850.97 doesn't matter to
me whatever works.
2852.45 I happen to be an omnivore.
2853.575 But I think once
people understand
2855.8 the energy to do
things is neural,
2859.69 and yet, of course, it relies
on having glycogen and all
2862.33 this stuff around, but neural
energy is what's really about,
2865.66 then your schedule and
the way you function
2867.887 and the way you
describe your schedule
2869.47 really makes a ton of sense.
2871.46 So you described getting up
and lifting, running, surfing,
2875.44 and jiu-jitsu in the same day.
2877.22 So on a day like that,
you're hydrating, correct?
2879.31 JOCKO WILLINK: Oh,
yeah, definitely.
2880.81 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Because that's vital.
2881.71 And I know in the Teams,
in the SEAL Teams,
2883.64 there's a lot of discussion
about hydration is important,
2885.58 even though you guys
I know are supposed
2886.66 to be able to eat sand and
survive on sunlight and dirt
2889.24 and drink your own blood.
2890.363 JOCKO WILLINK: Not me.
2891.28 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hydration
is taken seriously, right?
2893.2 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,
and different people
2894.908 need different
amount of hydration.
2896.71 And I, unfortunately, was one.
2897.995 I always needed to
bring a lot of water
2899.62 in the field which sucked
because water is heavy.
2902.05 And I have friends.
2903.46 One of my friends, Tony, BTF
Tony, he'd go in the field
2906.88 with like a can of Copenhagen
and coffee in his canteen
2910.17 and go like three
straight days--
2911.74 ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's
like a desert turtle.
2912.46 JOCKO WILLINK: He's
a desert rat, man.
2914.05 He could just survive.
2915.77 And I would always have
to bring this water.
2918.26 I sweat a ton when
I work out or when
2920.86 I'm doing anything that
requires physical output.
2925.69 I sweat a ton, so I have to
drink a lot of water for sure.
2928.99 But not everyone's the same.
2931.21 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I think
if most people focus more
2933.7 on hydration and movement.
2936.73 They would find they have two--
2938.793 I'm going to venture
a guess here,
2940.21 this is not a scientific study,
but two to four times more
2943.3 energy than if they focused on
caloric energy and what to eat.
2946.242 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, and I
think the cool thing about this,
2948.7 you're using the term energy.
2951.04 And what's cool about this
is you or I create energy.
2957.45 I create energy by, like I
said, by going and lifting
2961.29 in the morning, by
going and doing--
2963.51 you go do burpees?
2964.56 You go do 100 burpees like
you're creating energy.
2966.66 You're going to be tired,
you're going to be sweating,
2968.91 but you just created energy.
2970.35 So that stuff is
totally true I'm
2972.57 glad there's neuroscience
to back it up.
2974.46 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, I'm actually
2975.3 thinking about devoting
some of my lab to this.
2977.258 One of the best examples,
another familiar territory
2980.04 for you is cold water.
2981.33 Nowadays there's a lot about
ice baths and cold baths
2983.79 and showers and all that, and
I always like to just say,
2986.98 listen it's all just a
reliable source of inducing
2990.66 adrenaline release.
2991.68 And you get out of a cold
shower, you have more energy,
2994.77 and that energy couldn't
have been caloric energy,
2997.2 it's adrenaline.
2998.43 And again, it's fair
to say I'm obsessed
3002.12 by the ideas of identity,
which is a little bit how
3005.607 we started off and I want to
get back to it, and energy.
3007.94 I feel like identity
and energy can
3009.44 account for 75% of what
it is to live a good life
3014.01 if you can master
those, because then it
3016.38 all seems to fall into bins.
3017.967 Of course, you need sleep.
3019.05 Why?
3019.78 Well, to restore
your neural energy.
3022.5 At some point, you just
fade out of neural energy
3025.378 if you don't sleep.
3026.17 So sleep then falls
into a particular bin
3028.62 with a particular
purpose, and then exercise
3030.72 becomes not a way
to burn energy but,
3032.47 as you said, to create energy.
3033.72 And we actually are
starting to understand
3035.47 why this is if you'll
indulge me for a second
3037.62 on some neuroscience.
3038.52 We didn't talk about
this last time.
3039.93 We have neural circuits that
control deliberate action.
3042.24 We have neural circuits that
control deliberate actions
3044.22 that when we forget that
we're doing like walking.
3046.303 And then we have
neural circuits which
3047.887 are called central
pattern generators.
3049.53 And these are the
neural circuits
3051.06 that love to just work on their
own, and in the background
3054.113 just kind of hum
in the background
3055.53 and take care of all the stuff
like heartbeat, breathing
3057.863 and movement that is repetitive.
3059.64 If you're just
marching and you don't
3061.2 have to adjust
your cadence much,
3062.58 or maybe you're hiking even
and stepping this rock,
3064.705 that rock, once those central
pattern generators get going,
3067.74 it's very automatic.
3069.36 And we know that once your
central pattern generators get
3072.57 going, there's the release
of those catecholamines,
3076.32 those three or four
molecules that then feed
3079.47 all the other neural systems.
3080.678 They're called neuro
modulators for a reason
3082.512 because they set
the gain higher.
3084.06 So when you go out for a run
or a jog or a hike or something
3087.12 or you pedal or
you row, and then
3089.07 your whole system
is at a higher RPM
3091.56 so when you say create
energy, neuroscientists
3094.77 are starting to understand what
that is, repetitive movement
3097.77 that allows you to forget
the motor commands that
3100.405 are required to
generate that movement.
3102.03 You might think about your row
stroke or something like that,
3104.572 but you can do it
without thinking much.
3107.1 You come off of that and you
now are set at a higher RPM
3111.27 to do more deliberate stuff.
3112.84 And none of this, again,
involve like eating
3114.973 enough carbohydrates or making
sure you had enough ketones
3117.39 or enough protein.
3118.5 It's like you got
plenty of that stuff
3120.3 provided you nourish at some
point every 24 hours or so.
3123.72 I think we know a little bit
about the science behind Jocko
3127.38 Willink's schedule now,
but I will ask this,
3131.88 are there certain
forms of exercise
3134.25 like weight lifting
versus cardio
3136.17 that you find give you
an especially big boost
3140.032 in what we're calling energy?
3141.24 And here this could
be cognitive energy,
3142.907 it could be physical energy, a
readiness for the next thing?
3145.747 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, first I
got to back you up on this.
3148.08 I love backing up your science.
3151.41 So do you ever ruck march like
put on a heavyweight and ruck?
3154.7 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
sorry to interrupt.
3156.45 Yeah, Peter Attia
got me into this.
3158.25 He got me into doing
a long Sunday--
3160.14 instead of a long
Sunday, run throwing
3161.79 on a lightweight vest
or a ruck, and going out
3163.8 for like three hours.
3165.0 And the first 20
minutes, I find I always
3167.49 want to go faster
and get it over with.
3169.36 But then I've learned
that the real pain in it
3171.84 sets in around an hour,
and then the beauty
3173.905 sets in around 90
minutes, where you're
3175.53 like, I could do this
all day, all night,
3178.57 and I never want to stop.
3179.67 JOCKO WILLINK: See that's
when you were describing
3181.753 how these chemicals
get released,
3183.87 and once you're in
that automatic mode--
3186.12 because in the
SEAL Teams, you're
3189.48 doing Maritime
operations for a month,
3191.91 and then you're going to
do some kill shooting,
3193.868 and so you're not carrying
a bunch of weight.
3195.743 And then you go
out to the desert
3197.31 and now you're
putting on 80 pounds
3200.1 and you're going on day
one, and you get out there,
3202.66 you're going on an
80 pounds ruck march.
3204.57 And the first freaking 17
minutes, the first 23 minutes
3209.13 just suck.
3210.19 They just suck.
3211.08 And what was beautiful
was by the time I
3213.48 was 23, 24 years
old, like, oh, yeah,
3215.718 this is going to
suck for 17 minutes,
3217.26 and then it's going to be--
3218.19 I'm going to be a robot and
it doesn't matter anymore.
3220.06 I can just keep going forever.
3221.38 So now it sounds
like what you're
3223.14 saying is what I experienced
basically my whole adult life.
3226.992 There's going to be a little
break in period mentally
3229.2 where you think
this totally sucks,
3231.66 and then you just can keep going
for a really, really long time,
3235.33 and it's not that big of a deal.
3237.12 To your question of is there any
form of exercise that gives me
3241.05 that energy, I would have to
say like the high intensity
3244.71 sort of anaerobic blast,
whether it's on the bike
3248.34 or on the rower or swing and
a kettlebell hard, something
3252.21 like that that lasts
10, 15 minutes, that's
3254.43 a really good way to peak
my mentality for the day.
3259.09 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you
do the cold water thing?
3261.09 I mean, you certainly did a
lot of it in BUD/S. I mean,
3262.95 do you force yourself into cold
water and the you release--
3264.91 JOCKO WILLINK: I have a
cold bath in my house,
3267.18 and I get in every day.
3268.35 ANDREW HUBERMAN: How long
are you spending in there?
3269.67 JOCKO WILLINK: Usually
around five minutes.
3271.98 Five minutes.
3272.61 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before you
train or after you train?
3274.62 JOCKO WILLINK: After.
3275.17 So this is something I
haven't played with yet,
3277.128 and for me, I'm like such a--
3280.538 I don't like to make a bunch
of effort for something.
3283.52 So for me going downstairs
getting in the ice tub--
3286.7 and I guess you
only need to do it--
3288.28 before you work out, you
only go a minute, right?
3290.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
do a minute to three.
3291.28 Joe and I have been texting
back and forth about this.
3293.26 There's a lab at Stanford,
Craig Heller's lab that
3295.18 works on cold and
performance, and the athletes
3297.138 at Stanford, mainly
the cross-country team
3299.26 and the football
players are doing
3300.7 cold before their training
because of the huge increase--
3304.3 huge long lasting increase in
dopamine and adrenaline that's
3307.45 caused by that.
3308.41 They're finding it
increases performance
3310.09 mainly by waking people
up and getting them--
3311.965 it creates energy, basically.
3313.18 And students, everyone
thinks of like, oh, athletes
3315.52 are all super motivated.
3317.03 This is no pick against
Stanford athletes in particular.
3319.9 A lot of athletes
are excellent at what
3322.12 they do because they're very
lazy when they're not training.
3325.36 This is true.
3326.09 Not all athletes, but
a lot of athletes are.
3328.01 And so they're really good
at resting and recovering
3329.65 so they can train more.
3330.67 But a lot of athletes have a
hard time getting into gear
3334.18 to train every day, and the
cold is a great stimulus.
3337.72 It's like a four shot of
espresso kind of stimulus
3340.78 without all the jitters.
3342.46 JOCKO WILLINK: I think maybe
going in there for a minute
3344.89 would be cool before a workout.
3346.33 I will say this.
3347.56 So I had a long workout and
it was a Saturday, which means
3352.51 on Saturday I do jiu-jitsu in
the morning around 10 o'clock,
3355.39 and I had like a long
workout, went for a long run,
3360.37 it was hot, and I just
got in the ice bath
3362.53 and I sat in there for like 7
minutes like the deep chill.
3366.34 I got out and then I went right
to jiu-jitsu, and I felt awful.
3369.29 I felt absolutely
awful like tight cold,
3371.98 and it took me an extra three
rounds to get warmed up again.
3375.49 So that kind of left a bad taste
in my mouth for pre-work icing.
3380.542 But I'm going to try this
short because I was talking
3382.75 to another friend of mine,
they're like, oh, no,
3384.75 only go a minute before.
3385.765 Maybe I'll give that a try.
3386.89 ANDREW HUBERMAN: If it's really
cold, 30 seconds to a minute
3389.59 is going to get you
this big release
3391.66 and adrenaline and dopamine.
3393.003 JOCKO WILLINK:
Actually one time I
3394.42 did try the chamber that
blasts cold air on you.
3398.947 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The cryo.
3400.03 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,
the cryo, and I
3400.81 did that for like a
minute or whatever,
3402.76 and that did make me feel
pre-workout pretty good.
3406.39 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I think
that the whole notion of cold
3409.12 for metabolism,
people say, well, it's
3410.89 not that big of an increase
in metabolism, look,
3413.02 as far as I'm concerned,
the main function
3415.36 of the cold for
most people is going
3416.86 to be the discipline of doing
it, the sense of resilience
3421.51 that you can build up over time
just being familiar with having
3424.45 adrenaline in your system.
3425.71 And then the fact that the
dopamine increases are huge
3428.5 and long lasting, I mean,
they're like 2.5x increases.
3431.483 There's a colleague
of mine at Stanford,
3433.15 an alumni who runs our dual
diagnosis addiction clinic.
3435.73 She had a patient getting
off cocaine addiction who
3438.49 decided to use cold ice baths as
a way to kind of assist himself
3442.317 along the way.
3442.9 He wasn't getting dopamine
from cocaine anymore,
3444.73 so he decided to get
it from the ice bath.
3446.495 The difference is cocaine
gives you these sharp increases
3448.87 and then decreases that
drop you way below baseline,
3451.15 so what do people do if
they go seek more cocaine,
3453.233 it's really pernicious that
way, whereas the ice bath
3455.89 and cold showers will give
this long arc lasting two
3458.73 to three hours or more.
3460.67 And that's really
something to treasure,
3463.27 the idea that you can basically
save on your heating bill
3466.57 give yourself this
huge dopamine increase.
3468.642 And I think everything
points to the fact
3470.35 that it's healthy
and good but I mean
3471.892 obviously it's working for you
to do it after your training.
3474.392 I think all the gym rats who
want more hypertrophy you're
3476.89 trying to get an extra 1/8
of an inch on their tricep
3479.24 or whatever, they freak out
because they hear that it
3481.448 can inhibit hypertrophy.
3483.82 And then for whatever
reason, there's this--
3485.78 JOCKO WILLINK: So
am I doing it wrong?
3486.7 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I
mean, yeah, clearly you're
3489.31 doing it right now.
3490.3 No, you're not-- I don't think
your hypertrophy is suffering.
3493.27 I actually am of the
mind that if you're
3495.55 training really hard, sure,
getting in the cold afterwards
3498.19 might blunt some hypertrophy
that is what the data tell us.
3502.18 Andy Galpin is kind of the
expert on that literature.
3505.0 But frankly, I don't
know anyone that
3508.24 trains really hard
with the weights
3509.698 and then gets into the cold
that looks like they're
3511.823 suffering from hypertrophy.
3512.98 I know a lot of
people, however, who
3514.69 love to point fingers at
and poke at cold exposure.
3517.855 This seems to be a big
thing on social media.
3519.73 People who don't like the
cold love to point out
3522.43 the studies showing that the
cold screws up everything,
3525.46 and most of them look like they
can eat a few sets in the gym
3528.37 to me.
3528.97 And I feel comfortable
with poking at them
3530.83 because I feel like all
of these are just tools.
3533.74 And in any case, I'm a big fan
of deliberate cold exposure,
3536.89 mostly for the neural effects.
3538.42 Again I'm obsessing over
this concept of energy,
3541.06 and it's something that
I can't help but ask
3543.37 that is the cognitive side of
this and the effects of winning
3548.14 and losing.
3548.86 So you obviously have
a lot of deployments
3552.25 and a lot of wins, whatever
in the context that meant.
3556.21 Kill the target, capture
the hostage, et cetera.
3559.84 And then as is
the case with war,
3564.11 there have been some
cases of losses.
3565.93 You've lost people.
3567.37 Maybe there were targets
that weren't accomplished,
3569.968 this kind of thing.
3570.76 And you've posted about
these, and these are always
3573.94 things that are
hard to see, but I
3575.98 think it's really it's
important that you
3578.8 post about people that you've
lost because, first of all,
3581.95 these people served, but
second of all, things
3583.888 don't always work out
the way that we want,
3585.68 and sometimes to really
catastrophic consequences.
3590.65 There's a theory in
biology that when we win,
3593.52 we somehow get more
energy to win more
3595.95 through the release of,
no surprise, dopamine
3598.68 and some related molecules.
3599.88 And in fact, testosterone
in both men and women
3602.04 is another close cousin
of the dopamine system.
3604.5 They're actually released
from the same general--
3607.74 patterns of release are
from the same general areas
3610.08 in the brain, believe
it or not, and body.
3612.16 But when we win, we feel
like we can keep going.
3615.415 You look at the team
that wins and it's
3617.04 like they'll play another game.
3618.84 The Super Bowl
winners you imagine
3620.4 they're jumping up and down,
and they could probably
3622.567 play another Super Bowl.
3623.94 Losing we know can
sure can drop things
3626.67 like testosterone and dopamine
for some period of time.
3629.16 But when you were
in the Teams what
3632.89 was your observation about
how winning and losing
3635.35 would impact people in
the short and long term?
3637.485 In other words,
would you observe
3638.86 people that had a
quick reset button
3640.84 and could just say that was
terrible, and then transmute, I
3646.22 guess I'm getting into
the Eastern language
3649.01 now, to convert that into energy
to go do better the next time?
3654.93 Whereas we also see
people, military
3656.81 and in the civilian
world that a loss,
3660.14 in particular severe
losses, basically set them
3662.72 down the path of less
energy, and certainly
3665.69 is in less calories.
3666.65 In fact, most of the
time it's the other way.
3667.85 They start consuming
more calories
3669.08 and that doesn't get them going.
3670.07 So again, this notion of
energy, and now I'm asking,
3672.44 wins versus losses
what did you observe
3675.56 and from the perspective
of leadership,
3677.84 and maybe more importantly from
the perspective of yourself,
3681.05 how do you work with that?
3683.01 How do you calibrate
wins and losses?
3684.83 How do you transmute
losses into energy?
3687.59 Because winds we know
we convert to energy,
3689.72 but losses oftentimes can
sup our energy way, way down.
3697.44 JOCKO WILLINK: To
start with, I think
3699.27 that the selection process
to get into the SEAL Teams
3702.9 is going to weed out a bunch of
people that can't recover very
3707.22 quickly from something bad.
3709.44 So you probably heard these
type of stories before.
3713.1 The kid that was the star
of the football team,
3715.84 the star of the basketball
team, the captain of this,
3718.23 the captain of that, he's
been winning his whole life.
3720.48 He goes to BUD/S and he quits,
because in BUD/S, you're
3724.5 not going to win.
3725.65 You're certainly not
going to win everything.
3727.53 They're going to find
what you're not good at,
3730.14 and they're going to exploit
that, and you're going to lose.
3734.19 This is what happens.
3735.7 So a lot of guys
that may lose and it
3740.28 disrupts their motivation,
they're probably
3743.67 just going to quit.
3745.33 And so that's why you get
this massive attrition
3748.14 rate with guys that are studs.
3750.78 I mean, we're talking
Division 1 athletes.
3754.64 Division 1 athletes,
Division 1 wrestlers,
3756.39 Division 1 football
players, Division 1 runners
3758.34 and swimmers.
3758.882 They all come to
BUD/S. They all quit.
3760.68 all of them quit
but there's plenty
3762.48 of examples of the highest level
of collegiate athlete in sports
3767.37 that translate very
well to what you're
3770.85 doing in basic SEAL
training, and they quit.
3774.15 And sometimes it's because
they don't know how to lose,
3776.86 they don't know how to recover
from a loss, and they're just--
3780.96 so I think already once
you get to a SEAL Team,
3784.14 you've got people that
are generally speaking,
3788.32 going to be pretty
resilient when it
3789.87 comes to dealing with a loss.
3792.642 Not only that, I
mean, you just get
3794.1 used to talk about
losing people,
3796.35 you're friends
with this guy, you
3797.925 meet this guy in SEAL
training, hey, this guy
3799.8 seems like a stud, oh,
he's just going to quit.
3802.29 And you're going
to lose five, six,
3804.4 seven people, eight people.
3806.07 People quit so fast you cant'
even keep track of them.
3808.612 So you're just going to lose.
3809.82 You're just going
to get used to it.
3812.21 So there's that.
3813.23 Now once you're in
the Teams, what you're
3816.37 talking about is now you
start taking much more
3818.598 significant loss, you're
not losing a race,
3820.39 you're losing of
one of your friends.
3821.66 And this is what from a
leadership perspective
3823.81 you have to pay attention to.
3825.65 So when you're a leader
in any organization,
3830.31 you're basically
in charge of a mob.
3832.83 When it comes to what their
morale is, they're a mob,
3836.238 and they feed off
of each other, just
3837.78 like a mob riding in
the streets going,
3839.52 oh, we can break this window.
3840.728 Let's break all the windows, and
they move this mob mentality.
3843.57 And that happens with
morale inside of a team.
3847.02 And you as a leader can't
get caught up with the mob.
3851.19 You can't let that happen.
3853.32 You have to detach yourself
from the mob mentally so
3856.62 that you don't get caught
up in their emotions
3858.75 and their morale because if you
get caught up in their emotions
3862.11 and you get caught up in their
morale, you can't correct it.
3865.86 So we go out on a mission,
the mission goes great,
3869.94 we get into a gunfight,
kill a couple of bad guys,
3873.3 everyone's OK, high fives,
everyone's feeling great.
3876.075 You come back to base, hey,
we don't need a debrief.
3879.12 That was perfect.
3879.87 Hey, we don't need to
get our gear maintained,
3883.2 we can just go to
bed, we're awesome.
3885.58 That's when the leader has
to say, oh, we've got the mob
3888.45 and the mob is becoming
slightly arrogant.
3891.45 Hey, guys, real quick,
that was a good op,
3893.798 but there are some
things we could improve.
3895.59 You got to bring that mob
back and bring them back
3898.8 to center line.
3899.67 Same thing in the
other direction.
3901.23 You go out an operation,
it doesn't go well.
3903.18 You go out an operation,
you take casualties.
3905.16 Now you come back to base,
you see guys moping around,
3908.46 you see the spirit starting
to break, and same thing.
3912.09 If you're part of that
mob, you'll be with them,
3916.052 your morale will be breaking,
your spirit will be breaking.
3918.51 You've got to look up and say,
oh, I see what's happening.
3920.927 Hey, guys, listen up.
3922.83 That was tough.
3923.94 Didn't go the way
we wanted it to go.
3926.04 We need to learn some lessons.
3927.72 Here are some things
I can do better.
3929.35 What can we do better to make
sure that never happens again?
3933.15 What can we do to make sure
we have the opportunity
3935.73 to go out and avenge our
brother on the battlefield?
3939.93 What can we do to move
this thing forward?
3941.74 So as a leader when it
comes to winning and losing,
3944.49 you're generally going to be the
person countering what the mob
3947.91 mentality is because when
the mob starts winning,
3950.82 they want to keep winning
and they might get arrogant.
3953.73 When the mob is
losing, they might
3956.7 start to lose more because their
attitude goes down the drain.
3960.357 So that's where you
have to pay attention to
3962.19 from a leadership perspective.
3963.44 For me personally,
I know what I did
3971.26 when I lost guys was
focused on, all right,
3977.92 we need to celebrate the life,
we need to mourn the loss,
3985.54 and then we need to go to work.
3987.01 We need to get our gear back on.
3988.48 We need to lock and
load our weapons.
3990.29 We need to get back out there.
3992.21 I know that that's
what we needed to do.
3994.57 So often, the best way
to contend with problems,
4002.17 with issues, with adversity is
action, is by taking action.
4009.38 The more you sit
and the more you
4011.68 wait and the more time you
spend with that adversity
4015.43 with the upper hand
inside your head,
4017.92 the worse it's going to get.
4020.26 So for me always taking action,
making something happen,
4024.34 it doesn't have to
be huge, it doesn't
4026.16 have to be some mammoth
triumph that you're
4030.84 going to go and
pursue, but if you say,
4033.64 hey, listen, this what happened.
4036.713 Didn't go the way
we wanted it to.
4038.13 We're going to get
our gear back on.
4039.9 We're going to go back out.
4041.13 We're going to do
this other mission.
4043.53 And that's what I think.
4045.63 Taking action, and it's
in your personal life too,
4048.508 something doesn't go the
way you wanted it to go,
4050.55 you didn't get the
job you wanted,
4051.81 you didn't get the hire, you
didn't get the promotion,
4054.06 you can go home and sit
there and dwell on it.
4056.91 That's not getting
you any progress.
4058.41 Or you say, OK, you know what,
let me do a quick analysis why
4061.083 didn't I get that promotion.
4062.25 Oh, it's because I didn't
get this qualification
4064.71 or I hadn't jumped
through this gate.
4067.96 OK.
4068.46 Cool.
4068.96 What do I need?
4069.71 Let me look into how do I
get to jump through that gate
4071.64 so next time I will
get the promotion?
4072.83 And you start taking action.
4074.23 So action for me is a
cure for a lot of problems
4077.46 that we have in life.
4079.952 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love this
because the image that's
4082.16 arising my mind, I'll
share it with you
4084.5 and tell me where it agrees with
and maybe violates what you're
4087.86 telling me, but what I was
imagining it when you were
4090.38 talking about leadership in
the mob is a bunch of candles,
4094.1 but not wax candles,
these are oil candles.
4096.788 And you're talking
about a win, so it
4098.33 could be an op to go out
and win, it could be a team,
4100.04 it could be an individual taking
an exam and they get an A-plus,
4102.859 it doesn't matter, but
they're riding high.
4105.83 I mean, those winds we know
crank up those catecholamines,
4108.41 and it's as if the
intensity of that flame
4110.81 starts going up
as a consequence.
4112.91 That's natural.
4113.75 But the oil and the candle
is continuing to burn down.
4116.149 Like you need to celebrate wins,
but you're burning that oil.
4118.888 And so what we're really
talking about here
4120.68 is how to moderate and
then reclaim energy.
4124.01 And I was imagining
as the leader who
4125.84 like OK, guys,
great, but listen,
4127.85 you're burning that oil.
4129.92 That oil is what
got you the win.
4131.99 Let's not just clamp it like
we can do a few fist bumps
4135.609 and maybe celebrate
it in some other ways,
4137.359 but then let's take
the energy we got
4139.819 and put it to the next thing
rather than just go crazy.
4142.88 Drugs of abuse, in
particular drugs
4144.979 that tap into the dopamine
system, namely cocaine
4147.74 and amphetamine, and just
because there's no way
4150.89 to avoid this if we're
being true to the biology,
4153.41 the energy the
dopamine system was
4155.633 designed for foraging
for all sorts of things,
4157.55 food, so people that
overindulge food or seek out
4160.189 food, sex, people that
overindulge in these things.
4164.21 Those things, and
again this sort
4165.8 of leans to Eastern
philosophy a bit but,
4167.899 there's Western
neuroscience or neuroscience
4170.18 we should just
say to support it,
4171.71 you start to deplete
these dopamine systems.
4174.319 The baseline starts to drop.
4176.149 And so I'm imagining that
the leader, you in this case,
4178.67 is saying like, listen,
let's tone it down,
4180.859 use the energy that we've
gained and put it to good use,
4183.29 rather than just burn
it up enjoying it.
4185.42 And then, of course,
after a loss when those--
4187.939 I sort of think of the
candles going dimmer
4191.149 but the oil reserve
is still there,
4192.67 and it's like how do
you start to tap back
4194.42 into the oil reserve?
4195.32 Well, you have to actually
ramp the candle up again.
4197.96 You can't just sit there waiting
for the intensity of the flame
4202.07 to come back.
4202.85 You actually have to
do something in order
4204.35 for that to happen.
4205.142 So maybe this isn't
the best analogy
4206.66 because it lacks exactly
what is the person turning
4210.028 the intensity up and
down on these candles,
4211.82 but that's what comes to mind.
4213.11 And in Eastern
traditions, there's
4214.527 this idea of Qi of
energy, energy to fight,
4217.85 energy to seek mates, energy
to seek food, energy for sex,
4220.97 energy for all of it
is the same energy.
4222.958 And I actually believe that the
energy that they're referring
4225.5 to are these catecholamines.
4227.06 I really do.
4227.787 Now there are other
energy systems too
4229.37 relating to child rearing,
pair bonding, oxytocin,
4233.12 all the kind of fuzzy warm
stuff, that's super important.
4236.247 I mean, we wouldn't
exist as a species
4237.83 the way we do we didn't honor
that energy system also.
4241.16 And that energy system that
we normally think of as love
4244.1 as opposed to forward
center of mass synergizes
4247.1 with this system.
4248.12 When you're working with
and training with and people
4251.36 that you love, this could be
your brothers, your sisters,
4254.39 whatever, your family, I
think there's an amplifying
4257.57 effect on this whole thing.
4259.19 If is just for
more dopamine, just
4261.32 for more money, just four more
wins, just four more trophies--
4264.102 I'll never forget
this as an aside.
4265.56 When I was a kid, I had
this weird experience
4267.435 where Tony Hawk's dad rescued
me from a skateboard contest
4270.95 in Linda Vista.
4271.713 The Linda Vista Boys
Club, everyone else
4273.38 left, I was left there alone.
4274.67 I was 14 because of my home
life at that time, et cetera,
4277.17 and he was like,
where are you going?
4277.94 I'm like, I'm going to
take the bus to Lancaster.
4279.47 I know this guy.
4279.95 And he was like, no, no,
you're coming to our house.
4282.185 I was like, OK.
4282.81 So he took me at Tony's house,
and I went into Tony's room
4285.89 that he had grown up in.
4286.94 Tony lived in
Fallbrook at that time.
4288.77 And the room wasn't
filled with trophies.
4291.26 The room was trophies
and I remember just
4293.69 thinking like, holy cow.
4296.15 And when I think
about that and I
4297.528 think about what a healthy
person Tony turned out
4299.57 to be because I
happened to be blessed
4301.07 to know him a little
bit, it's amazing
4302.72 because a lot of
people that had those
4304.37 trophies whatever
domain of life,
4306.92 they converted all that into
ways to just burn the oil down
4309.793 in their candle.
4310.46 He's a guy who's still
going in his 50s.
4312.92 So that's a little
side story, but I
4315.71 think this notion
of energy to me
4317.75 is so important
because, as you said,
4319.46 when we move toward action
and we complete something,
4322.82 the oil in that candle
starts to get replenished,
4325.49 and the flame burns hotter.
4327.68 I'd like to take a brief
break and thank our sponsor
4330.89 InsideTracker.
4332.33 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
4334.97 that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA
4337.43 to help me better
understand your body
4339.14 and help you reach
your health goals.
4340.94 I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done
4343.55 for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact
4346.502 your immediate and
long term health
4347.96 can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test.
4350.505 The problem with a
lot of blood and DNA
4352.13 tests out there, however,
is that you get data
4354.35 back about metabolic
factors, lipids, and hormones
4356.86 and so forth, but you don't
know what to do with those data.
4359.36 InsideTracker
solves that problem
4361.37 and makes it very easy
for you to understand
4363.53 what sorts of nutritional,
behavioral, maybe even
4367.13 supplementation
based interventions
4369.41 you might want to
take on in order
4371.09 to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic factors, hormones,
4373.79 lipids, and other
things that impact
4375.32 your immediate and
long term health,
4376.82 to bring those numbers into
the ranges that are appropriate
4380.03 and indeed optimal for you.
4381.768 If you'd like to try inside

4391.863 JOCKO WILLINK: What
you're talking about
4393.53 and I'm very
interested in this now,
4395.48 and I don't know if there's
already been measured
4397.82 or not, but what essentially
we're talking about
4400.55 is the confidence level.
4402.74 So if I go out and win,
I feel good about it.
4408.54 And let's say I'm doing
a jiu-jitsu tournament,
4411.413 and the first match
I go out there
4412.83 and I submit the guy in 30--
take him down, submit him
4415.2 in 30 seconds.
4416.02 I'm feeling good.
4417.25 I'm feeling confident.
4419.1 So what does that mean?
4420.477 My dopamine is up because
I got that victim.
4422.31 My testosterone was up
because I got that victory.
4424.393 My confidence is up
because I got that victory.
4426.67 Same thing other direction.
4428.17 If I go out first match
and I lose to somebody,
4431.31 my dopamine goes down, that
chemical thing goes down,
4434.61 my confidence goes down.
4436.89 And what I have to
do is I have to learn
4439.89 how to maintain a level of
confidence because if I get--
4444.323 if I win that first match,
win the second, I'll say,
4446.49 I'm going to kill this next
guy, and I go out and I'm sloppy
4448.86 and I don't care.
4449.53 That's when I get caught.
4452.86 If I lack confidence,
I go out there
4454.81 and there's nothing I will
do to beat this guy, that's
4456.55 going to be horrible.
4457.425 Of course, I'm going
to get smashed.
4459.16 So it's a similar thing
that we're talking about.
4461.71 I just wonder how
much if you start
4463.81 measuring because they
say, hey, if you win,
4466.63 your testosterone goes up.
4468.55 And then if you win more, your
testosterone goes up high.
4471.365 Your dopamine goes up high.
4472.49 Your confidence is going up,
but you can get to a point
4475.57 where your confidence
is too high,
4477.13 and now you're getting sloppy,
and now you don't care.
4479.38 And you mentioned cocaine.
4480.73 You see like videos of
people that are all coked up
4483.81 and, hey, I can do this.
4484.81 They think they
can do everything.
4485.8 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
All possibility.
4486.38 JOCKO WILLINK: Over confident.
4487.63 They're over they think
they can kick your ass off.
4490.12 That's like too much
dopamine, too much ego,
4493.15 too much confidence.
4494.205 The other side of
the spectrum is
4495.58 someone that's on some
kind of downer drug,
4497.77 and they don't feel like
they can do anything.
4500.65 They're lethargic,
their confidence is low,
4502.66 and they're just depressed.
4504.04 So there's an interesting
tie-in between dopamine, ego,
4509.47 confidence, and
probably testosterone
4513.99 that you get from
winning and from losing.
4516.09 And once again as a leader,
from a leadership perspective,
4520.03 you can't get
wrapped up in that.
4521.41 You can't get
wrapped up in that.
4523.69 You have to detach from it.
4524.913 You have to be able
to take a step back.
4526.58 And then if you're good
even as a competitor,
4528.67 you'll say, oh, yeah,
that last match was easy,
4531.07 but I need to prepare
for the next match.
4533.29 I can't bring over confidence.
4535.583 Look, I don't want
to lack a confidence.
4537.25 It's a balance.
4537.97 It's that flame on
the oil burning lamp
4540.79 that you're talking about, that
you want that steady flame.
4543.382 You don't want too much
going to burn out of control.
4545.59 You don't want too little,
the flame will go out.
4547.81 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, earlier
we talked about this notion
4551.2 that some of these older
Hungarian psychologists
4553.72 had which this notion of
generators versus projectors.
4557.41 And their idea was that
people sort of divide
4559.33 into these different categories,
and the world needs both.
4561.747 It's not a that one is
better than the other,
4563.63 but the world
absolutely needs both.
4566.35 And there is this idea now
based on some neuroscience
4569.95 and some other
psychology that I've
4571.87 been kind of glazing into
which is that generators
4577.45 know how to tap into the system,
and they love this system.
4581.92 I think back to your story about
being taken to shop for pants
4585.16 and it turns out to
be a trip to shop
4586.99 for a number of different
experiences for you.
4589.66 A really telling experience,
having an action effect
4592.277 on the world and something
coming back to you that still
4594.61 sits with you inside.
4595.66 In fact, there's
a dopamine circuit
4597.43 there still related
to this young woman
4599.98 or then young
woman at that time.
4602.96 Some people are
generators and I think
4604.58 that they are more attuned
to this dopamine system.
4607.17 And so as we're having
this conversation,
4609.17 I'm guessing that
about the estimate
4611.03 is that somewhere between
50 and 65% of people
4613.55 are going, yeah, I get it.
4615.77 More workouts are going
to give me more energy.
4617.87 I need to do more of that.
4618.96 I need to win I'm
back on my heels.
4620.69 I need to think about the things
I can complete, et cetera.
4623.148 And then the other 45% or
so or 35% might be saying,
4627.98 I don't really get it.
4629.12 Now the idea is that
the projectors can
4633.02 tap into these same circuits.
4634.31 Everyone has these catecholamine
circuits, dopamine et cetera,
4637.19 but that they tend to be more
of observers in the world
4640.16 and they like being
partnered with
4641.9 and symbiotic with these people.
4643.65 Now this starts to take on
stereotypical masculine,
4646.76 feminine things, but this exists
on both sides, it really does.
4649.91 There might be some
biases by biological sex,
4652.64 there may not be.
4653.607 We could argue that.
4654.44 It's probably an
argument that'll
4655.34 get us into more
trouble than to answers,
4657.35 and doesn't really matter.
4658.56 The point is that some
people are perfectly
4660.98 happy to be in the
company of people
4663.5 winning because they feel good
to see other people winning.
4666.2 They like to be a support staff.
4667.64 That's what makes
them feel good.
4669.14 Other people would rather
stick hot forks in their eyes
4673.31 than not be the person
engaged in the activity.
4676.22 Maybe not every activity
but the activity.
4678.06 So we're talking about the
generators and the projectors.
4681.89 I think that in the context
of moderating these systems,
4685.71 it's so key.
4686.66 I mean, it's key to have a
long arc and a career path,
4689.27 military, science, or otherwise.
4690.86 I think it's key in
every domain of life.
4694.71 And I think for me,
one thing that I've
4697.28 learned both the hard
way and I've also
4699.35 benefit from the
positive experience of,
4701.967 I think in relationships,
l this could
4703.55 be romantic relationships,
but also friendships
4705.95 and in family, because there
are generators and projectors
4712.0 almost always in those kind
of symbiotic relationship,
4716.05 romantic couple or a family,
some kids are more generators,
4719.47 some are more projectors
just by something, who knows?
4722.12 Maybe it's hardwired, maybe not.
4724.86 As the leader of
your family, I'm
4727.495 going to assume one
of the two leaders,
4729.12 but as a leader in
your family, I'm
4730.53 not going make any
assumptions here,
4732.03 as the leader of
your family, and also
4734.91 as a father in
particular, how do you
4738.83 apply these same
sorts of ideas when
4740.66 you know your kid is
kind of down because it's
4743.06 hard to be a 14-year-old or
because it was a bad day,
4746.72 or when they're up?
4748.73 I think the up states are as
interesting as the down states
4751.19 like, yes, got the
degree, got the win.
4753.5 How much do you
let them celebrate
4755.66 before you're like,
hey, listen, you just
4758.18 got yourself another
couple of milliliters
4760.213 of oil in your candle, what
are you going to do with that?
4762.63 You're going to burn
it, or you going
4764.172 to save it for the next thing
so you can climb the staircase?
4767.62 JOCKO WILLINK:
Well, clearly it's
4769.178 a very similar thing to
what I just talked about.
4771.22 If your kid is doing well and
wins the wrestling tournament
4775.57 and is like, yeah, I won
the wrestling tournament,
4777.85 and what do they want to do?
4779.017 They want to eat a
triple cheese pizza,
4781.15 I mean, they want to go
crazy and you as a leader
4785.2 and as a parent and as a
friend, you'd say, hey, man,
4788.86 I mean, you did good.
4789.892 That was awesome.
4790.6 You had a great
day, but let's start
4793.44 thinking a little bit
about next week too.
4795.19 How about we just have a few
slices of pizza as a reward?
4799.6 So this is the same
in any situation
4802.63 that you could be in interacting
with other human beings.
4805.69 You want to be the person
that kind of modulates
4809.56 the confidence and
the ego or the way
4812.53 you put it, the dopamine and
the celebratory activities.
4817.03 So no matter who you are,
and this goes with yourself
4820.3 as well, you do something, you
have a success and you say,
4823.45 Oh, that's great, but
all glory is fleeting,
4828.36 and I need to get back to work.
4829.8 And look, and do people
go too far with that?
4831.93 Sometimes yes, absolutely.
4833.19 Sometimes people, they don't
stop and celebrate at all.
4835.76 And those are the kind of people
I think that get burned out
4838.26 eventually because they never
say, hey, that was awesome.
4840.82 We had a big win.
4841.53 Cool, high five.
4842.52 They don't even say that.
4844.88 So I think as a
leader, as a friend,
4847.34 as a parent, as a
spouse, you want
4850.33 to be able to modulate
that, help modulate that,
4853.99 don't shut it down.
4855.88 Your kid walks off the
wrestling mat for a high five
4860.17 and you say, you could
have won by more.
4862.06 No, I'm not talking about that,
or your kid walks off the mat
4865.01 after losing, you say,
you got what you deserve.
4867.01 No you've got to be the
counterweight to the emotions
4871.6 that other people have.
4873.04 And I think that when you're
doing a good job as a leader,
4876.178 as a friend, as a
spouse or whatever,
4877.72 you're doing a good
job as a counterweight.
4880.03 I think that's a good
way to look at it.
4882.01 You want to provide
some balance for people
4883.82 to make sure that they
don't get out of control.
4885.82 And you notice when
people have a downfall,
4890.43 it's normally because
they've surrounded themselves
4892.76 with people that
there's no counter to,
4894.5 there's no counterbalance.
4895.64 If you were my best friend and
I went out drinking last night
4899.36 and had a great time and
partied all night and met a girl
4902.9 and you're like, heck, yeah,
let's do it again tonight,
4905.45 eventually, where
are we going to be?
4906.53 We're going to be in
the gutter somewhere.
4907.82 But if you say, hey, that
was awesome, but remember we
4910.37 got school on Monday, and
you kind of pull me back,
4913.79 we got to find balance
in life and ourselves,
4917.51 and then we got as much
as we can provide balance
4919.58 for other people because
people are emotional
4922.067 and they get caught up
in what they're doing
4923.9 and you want to keep
people balanced.
4925.807 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
one of the reasons people
4927.89 are really drawn
to your message,
4929.03 and I put myself
in that category,
4930.54 and I remember 2014 was a
very different picture for me,
4932.873 it doesn't really matter
what the contour was,
4935.51 things were working,
but they weren't working
4937.418 the way I wanted them to.
4938.46 And I remember arriving
at your content
4940.37 first through the
Tim Ferriss podcast
4942.05 and then eventually the
Jocko Willink podcast,
4946.31 Joe Rogan podcast, those
were the big two ones
4949.047 that kind of like introduced
me to you and your content,
4951.38 and it was really a
case of at the time,
4955.17 I didn't have a
lot of friends that
4957.75 were doing similar
things to me or that
4959.82 matched my daily
routines in a way
4961.71 that I could kind of
synergize with in this way.
4965.46 I think one reason why you
are so helpful to people
4969.21 is that not everybody
has these friends.
4971.848 You can have the friend
that's like, let's go out
4973.89 and tie one on again,
a lot of people
4975.57 don't even have that friend,
or they have a friend,
4977.83 but they're not really
close with that person.
4980.86 There's some ideas
nowadays about 80% of males
4983.852 don't have a close friend
that they could call.
4985.81 I don't know, I mean,
I'm guessing girls
4988.12 and women feel the same too that
a lot of stuff is superficial,
4991.6 and there's a lot
of communication
4993.19 but not a lot of connection.
4995.41 And so I think that you and
a few other people in the--
4999.7 let's call it social
media public facing space,
5002.49 serve as archetypes
of the friend that's
5004.74 going to tell you when
you're up, great, but let's
5007.95 clamp it after a while,
or that when you're down,
5010.11 let's get going and
here's how you get going.
5012.37 And so I do want to highlight
that because I think
5014.79 it's really important and it's
but one reason why people are
5018.45 drawn to your message and the
message of some other people
5021.0 who are out there trying
to do similar things,
5022.917 but you in particular
because yes, you
5025.8 have this military
background, very
5027.51 intense military background,
wartime background,
5030.33 but also you bring it into
the daily routines that
5034.02 certainly apply to everybody.
5035.7 Most everybody can
access non-heated water,
5039.06 one would hope.
5041.61 There's another
dimension to this
5043.05 that I want to just bring up and
get your reflections on as it
5046.59 relates to military, work,
school, relationship, family,
5050.82 et cetera, which is somewhat
counterintuitive idea but then
5055.392 once you hear it, it
makes perfect sense,
5057.1 which is that even though
the catecholamines are
5058.71 responsible for drive, and
that that's what we're really
5061.405 about when we're
forward center of mass
5063.03 and we have to control the
intensity of the candle
5066.253 and the level of the oil, I
don't know what those actually
5068.67 mapped to exactly.
5069.72 We could probably figure it
out if we really parsed it,
5072.33 but that's the idea
here, the analogy.
5077.64 In a kind of
surprising way, we know
5081.9 that for sure one way to restore
levels of motivation drive
5086.95 enthusiasm, and to some
degree confidence that things
5090.1 could be different is through
deep rest, things like sleep.
5094.97 When things are
really, really hard,
5096.47 when kids are just like they
were like falling apart,
5099.26 it's like you put them
to sleep, they wake up
5101.18 and they're like
delightful, they're
5102.32 running around their
pajamas when they're little,
5103.85 and a teenager wakes up
after a good night's sleep,
5105.99 they might be a little
like surly, but we're back.
5108.65 Adults are like this.
5109.79 The world is falling apart.
5111.71 You go to sleep, wake up,
OK, I might be able to manage
5115.64 this kind of mindset.
5117.96 So sleep.
5119.04 And then the other
one is we know
5120.72 that play, the kind of physical
activity or mental activity
5126.57 where it might be a
little competitive,
5128.61 but the stakes are low, and it's
really more about connection
5131.705 with the activity or
connection with somebody else.
5133.83 Like we're going to
play a game of whatever,
5135.93 I won't play chess with Lex
because he'll kick my ass,
5138.18 I won't do jiu-jitsu
with either of you
5139.805 because you'll beat me
up both of you, kindly,
5142.11 but you'll do it.
5143.49 But if we were to play a
game, it's just us yeah,
5145.71 we might be a
little competitive,
5147.085 but the stakes are low.
5149.81 We know that play and
social connection and sleep
5155.38 are basically the
reservoir or the location
5158.8 that you go to refill the oil
in the candle every single time.
5162.77 And so for you, where do those
things play into your routine?
5166.19 You mention you can go hard all
day and then in the evening,
5169.36 is it dinner with family,
typically if you're at home,
5172.092 and what does that look like?
5173.3 I know we're kind
of parsing in--
5174.28 I don't want to carve into
your personal life too deeply,
5177.01 obviously, there are
boundaries there,
5178.63 but what does that look like?
5179.99 Is it everyone at the
table, phones away,
5182.29 and you're talking
about the day?
5184.33 Or is it-- yeah, share
with us a little bit
5186.785 of what that looks
like because I think
5188.41 it is an important contour
to what you're about
5192.027 and what we're talking
about that most people just
5194.11 don't have a window into.
5195.167 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,
so, well, first of all,
5197.0 I mean, just the refilling
the tank with games, I mean,
5200.17 that's what jiu-jitsu is.
5201.212 You're going to go
and you're going
5202.67 to have social
connection with people,
5204.31 you're going to talk to
people that you know,
5206.185 you're going to
joke about whatever,
5208.277 then you're going to roll.
5209.36 You're going to have
a good time rolling,
5210.85 you're going to get
a little sweat on,
5212.11 you're going to feel good,
then you're going to high five
5214.485 like there's huge--
5215.77 that's there, and your
brain is kind of off.
5219.64 When you're training
jiu-jitsu at a certain level,
5223.63 you're not going to
be thinking anymore.
5225.38 Same thing with surfing.
5226.38 You go surfing and
you catch a wave.
5228.22 I mean, you're not
thinking about, oh, I
5230.175 need to put my
balance over here.
5231.55 No, it's happening and
you're having a good time.
5233.592 So I would say that restoration
for me comes from those two
5238.37 things for sure.
5239.63 And then yeah, I mean, my wife
and my kids when I get home--
5243.17 and my kids are older now, and
they're out of the house except
5247.82 for one.
5250.8 And when I was in the
Navy when they were young,
5253.91 I wasn't around at all.
5257.12 We would rarely have dinner
together because I was gone,
5259.55 coming home late, you're
working all the time,
5261.68 you can never get all your work
done, I'm training jiu-jitsu,
5266.03 we rarely ate dinner as a
family when I was in the Teams.
5271.67 And now when I'm home, we
can eat together for sure.
5275.42 My daughter that's
still at home,
5277.88 she's going to-- we sit out
there and eat dinner and talk
5281.18 about just normal things
that people talk about,
5284.57 like how to conduct
a night ambush or--
5288.92 let's talk about normal daily
things and what's going on.
5295.04 And my daughter,
she's 13 right now
5298.31 and she talks to me
about all kinds of stuff,
5301.16 and it's awesome.
5303.29 Yeah, I'm definitely
enjoying that aspect
5307.58 of being around more than I
was when I was in the Teams
5311.72 and we didn't have dinner.
5314.42 Didn't happen.
5315.17 So I would take my
kids to jiu-jitsu,
5319.43 I taught jiu-jitsu
classes when I could
5321.26 when I was in the Teams,
would do workouts with them
5325.43 in the morning if I had time
on the weekends for sure,
5328.19 stuff like that with my kids,
that's kind of what I did.
5332.81 But now yeah, we--
5335.03 my wife is awesome, and
she is a great cook now
5341.36 because when we first got
married, it was questionable.
5345.41 I just was harassing her
about this the other day.
5350.75 She's an unbelievable cook
now, and it's awesome.
5353.36 And when we first met,
by her own admission,
5356.73 she will tell you she was not.
5358.095 She's from England,
and so they're just
5359.72 not cooking what we're liking.
5361.642 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No,
the food over there,
5363.35 at least when I was growing
up in the few times I made it
5365.3 over there, the food
was pretty dreadful.
5367.32 I mean, there were some
exceptions to that,
5370.64 and they drank a lot over there.
5372.48 So I've been to some
scientific meetings over there
5374.66 where they would start with
like Sherri in the afternoon,
5377.33 and then beer after work.
5378.39 It was outrageous.
5379.46 I mean, the amount of alcohol
intake was just absurd.
5382.467 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
5383.3 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, Brits.
5384.552 And again I'm not trying to--
5385.76 I did an episode on
alcohol, a lot of people
5387.17 were angry about that episode
because it's basically said,
5389.16 once you get past
two drinks a week,
5390.59 you're starting to
head into territory
5392.173 that can deplete
your health, so you
5394.245 got to do a lot of other
things to offset it.
5396.12 But they drink a lot.
5398.218 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,
the Brits drink a lot.
5400.01 I have spent time over
there with my father-in-law,
5403.85 my brother-in-law, and we
definitely drank a lot.
5408.08 So I'm glad I don't live there
and had to drink with them.
5410.78 I'm glad I don't have to
drink with them all the time.
5413.12 I'd probably be dead.
5414.71 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You were
straight edge growing up,
5415.91 right?
5416.51 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I
mean, when I was a kid,
5418.47 and then when I joined the
Navy, I started drinking.
5421.97 That's like part of the
culture that I bought into.
5424.43 And I wanted to be
a good SEAL, and I'm
5429.98 looking around at the guys that
were considered good SEALs,
5433.25 oh, so we're drinking?
5434.51 OK, that's what we're doing.
5436.74 And that's what I did.
5443.59 Looking back now,
I didn't really--
5446.642 I didn't think of it as
a big deal at the time.
5448.6 I wasn't like-- well, first of
all, even when I was growing up
5451.183 and I didn't drink and didn't
smoke, didn't do drugs,
5455.98 I wasn't like a guy putting an X
on my hand, although my friends
5460.63 and I, we all didn't
drink, didn't smoke.
5462.52 So we definitely-- look, I
was listening to Minor Threat
5464.63 when I was a kid.
5465.338 I mean, I get it, but
I wasn't I running
5468.07 around telling everyone
I was straight edge,
5471.43 but I was on that path for sure.
5473.77 And then when I got in the
SEAL Teams, it's like, OK,
5476.26 this is a different culture.
5477.928 I'm not used to it.
5478.72 And I didn't really even
understand what drinking was.
5482.62 I mean, I never had been drunk.
5485.68 So got on the SEAL Team
so I was like, OK, well,
5487.99 once I turned 21, hey, these
guys were going to have fun,
5493.06 and I kind of just, OK,
that's what we're doing,
5495.85 and then I drank a ton while
I was in the SEAL Teams.
5498.35 And then as I retired from
the SEAL Teams and went out,
5504.87 we basically went to every
bar that we would normally
5508.48 go to like as SEALs.
5511.63 I think we closed out the
night at the Park Shores in OB.
5515.23 And when I went
home that morning,
5517.835 I woke up the next
morning, worked out,
5519.46 and then I just kind of
stopped drinking because--
5523.45 and now I just
definitely, I mean,
5525.76 now I just don't
really drink anymore.
5527.44 So that's that.
5531.015 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, when I had
5532.39 my lab in San Diego
for five years,
5533.95 that's where my lab
started, I definitely
5536.348 saw a lot of Team guys in bars.
5537.64 You guys would come
in and take over bars.
5540.16 These were little takeovers.
5541.9 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
5542.745 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I wouldn't leave
5544.12 because I wouldn't like
give them the satisfaction
5546.34 or me the dissatisfaction, but
it was a little frustrating.
5549.817 You're in there, you're
having a decent time
5551.65 and then just this
enormous pack of Team guys
5553.6 comes in and sort
of like, all right,
5555.22 maybe it's time to
close out the night.
5558.01 I was friends with
enough of them,
5559.577 but if you're not
really a part of it,
5561.16 you're not really a
part of it, and I always
5562.993 knew that and understood that.
5564.31 One thing that I think really
comes through now especially
5569.11 but throughout our
discussion and all the things
5571.45 I've seen of you,
and it gets me back
5573.337 to this thing that came
up at the beginning,
5575.17 I'd really like to
return to is that you
5578.46 seem to have a very strong
sense of context and self.
5583.562 I'll just say it, I'm
not a psychologist,
5585.27 I'm not here to play
one, but what you just
5587.94 described was that
in one context,
5589.928 you know it made sense
to be straight edge,
5591.72 and you mentioned Minor Threat,
great band, straight edge band,
5594.345 but when it came time to run
around with your friends then
5597.99 and it made sense to be without
alcohol or drugs or anything
5601.763 at that stage and then you
get into another context,
5603.93 it's like OK, I can do this.
5605.44 I can drink and still
perform well and do
5607.783 all the things I need to do.
5608.95 And then when that closes out,
I'm going to do something else.
5612.165 And some people are like
that because they're
5614.04 kind of a chameleon.
5616.17 They're switching themselves
depending on the context,
5618.48 and they're kind
of getting accents
5620.413 when they're in one
location or another,
5622.08 but that's not you at all.
5623.49 I can tell with certainty
that's not you at all.
5626.25 There seems to be a very
strong sense of self
5630.1 so that when we have a
sense of self that's firm,
5633.69 we can go into
different contexts.
5635.29 We can even change
our behavior, but we
5636.915 don't lose who we
are, which means
5638.625 we can always return to it.
5639.75 The image in my
mind is like I've
5642.255 done a little bit of
scuba diving, not a lot,
5644.13 but during some of the more
advanced training for us,
5647.01 this wasn't SEAL
training, of course,
5649.06 was following a line in the
dark, like a night dive.
5651.628 And you're following a
line, and sometimes you're
5653.67 navigating with tools,
but suddenly you're
5655.42 following a line underwater.
5656.61 And this idea that you
can let go of that line,
5658.993 but you have to remember where
it is you can return to it.
5661.41 And that's kind of how I
imagine the sense of self
5663.493 because in different
contexts, most healthy people
5665.58 modify themselves a little bit.
5666.69 We act differently at
a wedding or a funeral
5668.64 than we do in class or
out with our friends.
5672.005 Of course, it's
an important part
5673.38 of being a functional human.
5675.15 So it seems to me that
from a pretty early stage,
5677.88 you had a pretty
good sense of self.
5681.283 Now I don't know if
you sit in your room
5682.95 and meditate on who is
Jocko Willink and touch
5685.53 that central chord of self.
5687.3 I'm guessing you don't.
5688.32 But as I say this,
I have to ask,
5690.79 was there something in your
upbringing, your parents
5694.77 or was it just kind of how
you always imagine yourself is
5699.39 like, yeah, this is who I am.
5700.77 No matter what happens around
me, I kind of know who I am.
5704.385 Even if I'm engaging in
some of the behaviors
5706.26 that I might not do
in another context,
5707.885 I know who I am
because I actually
5709.53 think that many people do not
have a very firm sense of self,
5714.03 or their sense of self is
so rigid that they can only
5717.96 operate in this narrow
trench of one domain of life
5720.78 and they end up
very, very isolated.
5723.18 So I'd love for you to share
with us what your recollections
5725.79 are like the first time you
realized like, yeah, I'm
5729.42 good in a bunch of
different places.
5731.74 I'm safe or I'm whatever,
because I think this is also
5734.67 relates to confidence.
5739.19 JOCKO WILLINK: I'm
glad you are giving me
5741.44 the benefit of the doubt
on going in the Teams
5743.78 and being like, oh, hey, man,
looks like guys are drinking
5747.193 and I haven't
really drank before,
5748.61 and it seems like these
guys are having a good time.
5751.35 Let's go have a good
time with these guys,
5752.45 and that's kind of
what I did right.
5756.55 As far as, and I look at it
now and unfortunately for me,
5763.01 I look at alcohol now as just--
5765.62 I've seen it destroy
so many people
5767.96 that I've now kind of look
at it and go, man, I don't
5773.11 think people should drink.
5774.55 And look, I get it.
5775.69 I'm kind of an example.
5777.1 I used to drink and go
out and have a good time,
5779.48 and it wasn't that
big of a deal.
5780.855 It didn't negatively impact
me in some dramatic way,
5783.04 but I have so many friends
that it is horrible for.
5788.68 It is all but
ruined their lives.
5791.74 And it's totally legal,
which is kind of bizarre.
5796.72 So I think that figuring
that out when I look back,
5800.83 and the culture in the
SEAL Teams was very--
5805.13 there was very alcohol centric.
5807.62 And part of that is because
it's just like a fraternity is
5812.12 alcohol centric,
or a football team
5815.152 is because you got a
bunch of young dudes
5816.86 that are going to drink
and have a good time.
5818.735 So it's just sort of a
young dude kind of thing,
5822.44 and unfortunately, it ends up
ruining a lot of people's lives
5827.48 and they make bad decisions
and they do stupid things
5830.0 and it's just not good.
5831.68 And I think the culture
is moving away from that
5834.68 a little bit in the SEAL Teams.
5837.23 My alcohol brief
used to say, I used
5842.235 to tell my guys if you
go out, you get a DUI,
5846.45 you get put in jail
for a fight, you
5849.4 get hurt because you're
doing something drunk,
5852.46 you just did Al
Qaeda's job for them.
5854.89 You just did al-Qaeda's job.
5856.36 They want to take you
off the battlefield,
5857.74 and you just took yourself
off the battlefield.
5859.15 You can't go on deployment now.
5860.56 And that would always hit guys.
5863.08 And I think that
that's the SEAL Teams
5866.14 kind of leaning in
that direction more,
5867.88 realizing the
negativity of alcohol.
5871.39 I wish I would have
realized that earlier.
5874.343 I wish I would have
been a better leader
5876.01 and recognize that
in an earlier stage,
5877.93 and recognize that just because
I was kind of getting away
5880.36 with it, meaning I didn't
wake up in the morning,
5885.11 oh, man, I can't wait to quit.
5886.36 I never really had that feeling.
5889.245 I wish I would have realized
that there's other guys that
5891.62 do, and there's people that
can operate and be functional
5897.072 and it doesn't really
impact their lives,
5898.78 but there's a lot of
people that don't.
5900.405 And I don't think it's worth
the dice roll to start drinking.
5902.962 I just don't think it's
worth the dice for what
5904.92 do you get out of it?
5906.28 So I think that
overall that's why if--
5911.19 when I think about alcohol, I
just think about all the lives
5914.31 that it's ruined,
and I don't like it.
5916.5 And I wish I would have
done a better job of saying,
5918.75 you know what, this
is probably not good,
5920.97 and we shouldn't do this.
5922.29 And unfortunately I didn't, and
I try and convey that message
5925.32 as much as I can now.
5926.55 And it did bring me back to my
roots because when I was a kid,
5930.21 it was like alcohol is weak,
and you look at these guys,
5934.482 they don't know
what they're doing,
5935.94 they're acting like idiots,
I'm not going to be like that.
5939.34 And so as I got older, once
I got on the SEAL Teams,
5942.15 I went back to that.
5944.64 As far as where I became
me, I just actually
5950.61 have to give a lot of credit
to the music that I grew up
5954.06 listening to, and the attitude
that we had back then listening
5958.74 to hardcore music,
being able to stand up
5963.09 against what other people were
saying which is what you're
5966.09 doing when you're in that scene,
and the whole DIY nature of it.
5971.31 Hey, we can just
do this ourselves.
5973.56 We can just make this
happen for ourselves.
5976.35 We don't need anybody else.
5977.49 We can do this.
5978.84 And that hardcore attitude
and sticking by your friends
5981.75 and standing up and
getting in fights
5984.0 and that's what you're going to
do, that's kind of my attitude.
5987.57 And I got interviewed
for a documentary
5992.58 that they're making about Harley
Flanagan and the Cro-mags,
5996.0 and when I was a kid and
actually through my whole life,
6003.03 that music is the
soundtrack to my life.
6005.44 And so I always would have
that music running in my head.
6008.4 But to your question,
I had something in me
6012.39 that when I heard that music for
the first time, I was like, OK,
6017.587 here it is.
6018.87 Here it is.
6019.98 I hear the Beatles, I
hear the Grateful Dead,
6023.13 I hear the Rolling
Stones, I hear whoever,
6025.74 and you go, OK, that's fine.
6027.69 But when I heard hardcore
music for the first time,
6030.74 when I heard the Cro-Mags, when
I heard Agnostic Front, when
6033.24 I heard the Bad
Brains, I thought
6035.46 that was just like it
was part of me already.
6039.63 And then it was the
attitude, and again you
6042.54 can listen to my podcast
with Harley Flanagan,
6044.88 the way I viewed Harley
Flanagan, the way I
6047.16 viewed the Cro-Mags was not
the way they actually were.
6050.77 I mean, Harley was doing
drugs, I mean, horrible drugs.
6055.863 He was on heroin,
everything else,
6057.28 but his image was like straight
edge, kind of spiritual,
6063.165 they had all that stuff going
on and I thought, OK, well,
6065.54 that's who they are.
6065.8 But I didn't know,
I'm like a kid living
6067.78 in the woods in
Connecticut, I'm just
6070.09 glad to be hearing
what I'm hearing.
6071.95 He listened to
the lyrics, listen
6073.66 to the lyrics of Minor
Threat, listen to the lyrics
6076.0 and you go, OK, this stuff,
I agree with this stuff.
6079.22 And I just think
that that kind of
6085.73 set a datum in my head of
being OK with being outside,
6090.3 being OK with saying no,
being OK with being a rebel,
6093.8 being OK with not
going along with what
6097.372 everyone else is doing.
6098.33 And that came that became
very important when
6101.78 I was in the
military, and I looked
6104.6 at what leadership might
be telling me to do
6107.18 and might think to
myself, hey, that
6108.68 doesn't seem like a
good idea, and having
6110.42 the wherewithal
to say, hey, boss,
6111.895 I'm not sure this
is a good idea.
6113.27 Not to be a jerk
about it, but just
6115.01 to say there might be a
better way to get this done.
6117.18 What do you think of this?
6117.71 Or, hey boss can I ask
you a question about that?
6119.752 So I think if I had to trace it
back having Black Flag My War
6124.64 side too on my record player
for like a year and a half
6128.3 straight, that's going
to leave a mark, man.
6131.09 And I think it
left a mark on me.
6133.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love what you
just said, and when I say love,
6137.37 I really mean it
because as we both know
6139.98 we share a common love
for certain music,
6142.49 in particular Minor Threat and
some stuff from the punk rock
6144.99 scene.
6145.2 In particular for me, the
Northeast punk rock scene,
6147.3 the Bruisers, all borrowed from
the Bruisers, and now people
6149.58 know him as the lead singer
for the Dropkick Murphys.
6151.29 Before that was the Bruisers.
6152.498 And we run the
risk of going deep
6154.23 down a rabbit hole of music
that most people may or may not
6156.818 be familiar with,
although most people have
6158.61 heard the dropkicks, but yeah,
I'm right there with you.
6161.26 I mean, I remember
the first time
6162.635 hearing Stiff Little
Fingers or Rancid
6164.43 and even Bouncing
Souls for New Jersey--
6167.24 not even Bouncing Souls.
6168.24 Sorry.
6168.74 Sorry.
6169.32 Sorry, Brian and Greg.
6170.43 No, the Bouncing Souls
and going, yes, that's me.
6174.39 That's it.
6174.99 But as you said, it
was already in you.
6176.97 It's like a recognition,
and I bring this up,
6180.09 and I want to highlight
it, not because we
6182.49 share this, although I do find
that to be an amazing kinship
6185.402 that we felt right away, and
it was like we probably riffed
6187.86 for 25 hours just on that.
6190.23 But it brings me back
to this idea that--
6192.66 certainly is not my idea.
6193.92 Actually the first
time I heard about it
6195.6 was from Robert Greene
who wrote the book
6198.12 Mastery, and some important
writings, what was it?
6203.107 I think it was the--
6203.94 I forget how many laws of power,
but those books, Robert Green
6206.76 Mastery is actually a book
that I highly recommend.
6209.1 People read because it talks
about mentorship and finding
6211.92 mentors and the fact that we're
supposed to break up and move
6213.93 on from mentors, and that
mentors aren't always people
6215.97 that we know or that
know us, et cetera.
6217.637 Amazing book, really.
6219.36 But he was the
first person I ever
6221.07 heard describe this idea that
if we think back long enough,
6224.012 there's some seed moment, they
were shopping for the pants,
6226.47 it sounds like it was, but also
music where you see something
6229.53 and it's like, yes,
that's me and I'm that.
6233.28 And then that becomes
a sort of soundtrack
6235.29 or visual image or
something for your life
6238.2 that you carry forward with you.
6240.76 The neuroscientist
in me wants to say
6242.35 that that is the first
time that we really
6244.6 tap into this dopamine system
in a way that is unique to us,
6251.08 because every child
responds to food
6253.66 with a little bit of dopamine
when we're hungry, responds
6256.84 to warmth when we're cold,
responds to a warm dry diaper
6260.62 after we just wet
ourselves, which we all did.
6263.098 I don't know maybe, Jocko,
you change your own diapers.
6265.39 [LAUGHTER]
6267.158 But I'm guessing that
someone changed your diaper
6269.2 at one point, not an image
path we need to go down.
6271.91 But the idea is that we all
have these universal sources
6274.63 of having our needs met,
going from discomfort
6277.42 to comfort and back again,
which is basically childhood.
6281.24 But at some point,
something comes along
6283.37 that we really feel
is unique to us,
6285.2 and it may be the thing
that everyone else likes,
6287.242 maybe it's top 40
or whatever it is.
6288.842 Maybe it's the shoe
that everyone's
6290.3 wearing that seems good.
6292.02 But I do think that there
are certain people who
6294.74 are kind of 10 or 20 or maybe
even 180 degrees off from what
6298.67 everyone else likes and
they're like, that thing
6301.34 is what's really cool,
and it's a felt thing.
6304.2 And so along the lines of felt
things as opposed to things
6309.16 that everyone values, what are
your sources of motivation.
6313.85 And I'm going to guess that
some of them are internal.
6318.88 We could point ahead or
we could point to heart.
6320.88 Doesn't really
matter, but like when
6323.43 you think of sources
of motivation,
6326.17 do you have a palette of
them that you can dip into?
6329.23 Do you even feel the
need to dip into them,
6331.51 or is it really just
all about action steps
6333.55 throughout your day?
6334.6 Or if I can even venture
into somewhat harder stories
6339.813 that I've heard
you talk about, do
6341.23 you sometimes
think back, listen,
6342.732 I'm going to do this because
there are a bunch of guys that
6345.19 are dead now that
can't, and so I'm
6346.81 going to do it because I can.
6349.9 What are the paints on your
motivation pallet, if you will?
6359.545 JOCKO WILLINK:
Well, you probably
6360.92 heard me say that
motivation isn't something
6363.95 that I am going to count
on because it's just
6368.355 an emotion that's
going to come and go,
6369.98 and it's just like
feeling happy.
6374.852 You feel happy
right now, maybe you
6376.31 won't feel happy in 15 minutes.
6377.63 You feel sad now, maybe you
won't feel sad in 15 minutes.
6379.85 You feel motivated
right now, you might not
6381.642 feel motivated in 15 minutes.
6382.89 Therefore I can't rely on it.
6384.75 So I'm not going to put any--
6388.07 I'm not going to put
any money on just
6390.74 being motivated because it
doesn't really matter to me.
6394.34 So the daily actions that I
take aren't from motivation,
6400.04 they're just from discipline.
6401.57 Like I said earlier,
I'm not going
6403.17 to get up and go through
some big debate about,
6406.41 well, do I really
feel like doing this?
6408.325 No, I don't feel like doing
it, but doesn't matter,
6410.45 so I'm just going to go do it.
6415.29 Now if we start to look at a
broader movement through life
6423.76 and continuing to try and
move forward and move on,
6431.2 my buddy Seth died, and he was
the Delta Platoon commander
6438.26 in tasking a bruiser.
6440.33 And he died in 2017, and it
was in a parachute accident.
6451.74 I mean, it's
definitely unexpected,
6454.5 and also he'd already been
through multiple deployments,
6459.09 was with me in the
Battle of Ramadi,
6462.81 he then went back into
Sadr City and led a ton
6466.77 of very dangerous operations.
6469.83 And then he did
other deployments,
6473.88 and was kind of done with his
deployments, kind of done.
6477.66 And now he's just talking about
when he's going to retire,
6481.59 and he's a couple of years
away from retirement,
6483.9 and I'm talking
about, hey, we're
6485.73 going to work together again.
6487.72 And it all seems like
we're on a pretty good path
6491.61 to just move forward.
6493.53 And then he ends up dying
in a parachute accident.
6497.04 And he's a guy that was
really just kind of you're
6500.97 not going to be able to replace.
6507.78 There's a uniqueness to him that
is you're not going to find,
6511.41 and I've got some
stuff that he wrote.
6514.47 He was an incredible writer,
and I try and write something
6519.985 like him, and we
can't do it because he
6521.61 had a bigger vocabulary and a
more articulate way of writing.
6526.302 And so I can't write anything
as well as he wrote it.
6528.51 He was incredible at guitar, he
played guitar, played ukulele
6533.22 like sick, like an
incredible at playing guitar,
6537.12 and he's a total
knuckle dragger.
6538.92 Like a total meat
head knuckle dragger.
6542.64 His nickname was
Unfrozen Caveman
6545.31 because he just look
like a big caveman
6550.2 and yet he spoke French, and
could recite French poetry.
6556.26 And was really good
at learning languages,
6558.78 and he was an artist,
and he had-- do
6561.79 you know what synesthesia is?
6563.362 Do you know that is?
6564.673 ANDREW HUBERMAN: A
merging of the senses
6566.34 so people that can
see colors and--
6568.203 JOCKO WILLINK: So he
didn't know what it was--
6570.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm
sorry, see colors.
6571.05 I hope most people can
see colors-- sorry,
6572.8 that can hear colors and can
associate particular colors
6577.17 with sound like particular
keys on the piano.
6579.57 It's pretty rare.
6581.34 Some people think they have
it, but true synesthesia
6583.62 are pretty rare, but they don't
have to fight for this trait.
6588.8 It just kind of
emerges for them.
6590.39 JOCKO WILLINK: He
didn't know it.
6591.45 But one day he
was talking to me,
6592.89 and he was embarrassed
to tell me.
6595.19 He's like, what's weird is
when I think of numbers,
6600.32 I have colors in my head.
6603.74 And I go, what do you mean?
6605.34 And he says, hollow was zero,
and I remember seven is yellow.
6608.542 I don't remember any
of them, but he just
6610.25 rattled off like 123456789.
6613.22 He says, hollow, white, clear,
just rattled off these colors.
6619.143 He had that synesthesia,
and it gave him
6620.81 some kind of weird ability
to memorize numbers.
6623.09 So he'd be in a bar and talk
to some girl and he'd say,
6626.648 what's your number?
6627.44 And he would just-- he
would know it for two years.
6629.565 He would just know it.
6630.87 And that also made
him incredibly
6633.05 good at playing guitar
because now like the scale
6636.11 and the fretboard of a guitar,
it's a mathematical thing
6639.56 that he has all in this weird
coloration scenario going on.
6647.06 So he's this guy and
a very emotional guy.
6653.24 A very emotional guy who would--
6655.61 I was talking earlier about
being a balance for someone.
6659.3 I had to balance this dude out
on a daily basis sometimes.
6662.81 He'd be so mad about something.
6665.27 One day he'd be,
I hate the Teams.
6667.46 I hate all these guys.
6668.78 And I'd say, yeah,
I get it, man.
6670.382 And the next day, I'm never
getting out of the Teams.
6672.59 He would oscillate that
bad, and I would tell him,
6676.4 hey, bro, you're
oscillating again,
6678.41 and just would do anything.
6680.36 And he loved these guys and
would do anything for his guys.
6687.39 And so when he died, we're at
his-- it's not his funeral,
6697.81 it's before the funeral.
6698.86 It's like the open casket
thing, the wake thing,
6702.37 and myself, his brother,
Alex, Leif Babin who
6711.58 I wrote Extreme Ownership
with and JP O'Donnell, who's
6713.83 one of my brothers who works
with us at Arsenal on Front
6717.4 now is with us in Ramadi
and was very close to Seth,
6720.1 and everyone kind of
cleared out for us.
6724.75 And we go in there, and
I think JP gave him--
6733.04 JP had one of those Memorial
bracelets with guys' names
6737.57 on it that had died and
JP gave that to him.
6740.7 And I think Leif gave him some
surf wax because also Seth
6744.17 was a surfer, and I gave Seth
his black belt because he
6749.57 started training jiu-jitsu with
me and he had his purple belt.
6753.02 He had gotten his purple belt,
I gave him his black belt
6756.98 and everyone was just quiet.
6759.4 And JP was telling the
story the other day
6766.57 and I just said, we
will not fail him,
6777.11 meaning that him Mark,
Mikey, Chris, Seth,
6787.4 and countless other
guys they're not here.
6794.08 They don't have the opportunity
to do the things we do.
6796.95 They don't have the opportunity
to get up in the morning.
6800.26 So that's what it is, man.
6808.72 I won't fail those guys.
6811.042 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thanks
for sharing that.
6815.89 Yeah, thank God.
6818.68 Anyone listening
to this feels what
6821.35 I feel right now, which is very
clear that the depth of emotion
6828.88 for people that we
care about and lose
6830.86 has everything to do
with our love for them.
6834.29 There's just no
question about it.
6835.87 The grief and love are
so intimately tied.
6839.95 They are a direct
reflection of one another.
6844.69 And I hesitate to kind
of stay on hard themes,
6849.54 but I think it's really
important for a couple
6853.17 of reasons.
6854.85 Last time we spoke, it was in
your office and your podcast,
6859.92 and after we wrapped
up, we started
6861.905 talking about some
people we know
6863.28 and some things that had
happened in your community,
6865.447 and kind of spooled
into some discussions
6867.81 about things that happened
in nearby communities
6870.0 and civilian culture.
6873.11 And one of the things
that's so perplexing
6876.78 I think to people, including
me but maybe with time less so,
6884.04 and this actually came up last
night in a discussion at home
6888.98 because of some recent events,
not close to me, but is
6892.61 that some people go through
things where there's loss,
6897.38 they go through life
and there's hardship.
6899.19 I think most people experience
some hardship certainly
6901.46 some more than others.
6903.27 And every once in a while
and far too often, and even
6909.41 in the SEAL Team community, and
even in the various communities
6913.85 within the SEAL Team community
where one would never
6916.34 expect it, these are highly
trained tight community,
6923.22 hard guys, that's the
language we sometimes hear,
6927.6 but as you point out,
these are people often
6930.06 that have tremendous
emotional depth.
6932.08 And I'm so glad that you
brought that up because I think
6934.65 we sometimes think of emotion as
weakness, but there was a time,
6942.32 not long ago, 40, 50 years ago,
where emotions like jealousy
6947.543 and intensity,
think the character
6948.96 Sonny and the Godfather, he
would get so pissed, he would
6952.23 bite his own fist, that's
a pretty emotional response
6957.61 where intensity and emotion were
kind of interchangeable words
6963.43 at some level.
6966.17 I'm going to be direct.
6967.282 There have been a lot of guys
coming out of the SEAL Teams.
6969.74 I've been surprised to
hear they kill themselves,
6972.86 and yesterday there
was a major suicide.
6975.23 I didn't know this
guy in person,
6976.61 we actually followed each
other on social media,
6978.61 but I admittedly was not close
to him, didn't know him at all.
6981.78 In fact, his name was Twitch or
something, and he was this guy,
6984.98 he was a public facing figure.
6986.75 But listen, happens all
too often, and even happens
6990.38 in former operators.
6992.47 And suicide is something that
fascinates me and intrigues me
6996.37 and scares the hell out of me
because for the life of me,
6999.83 I cannot map it to any specific
thing in the brain or body that
7004.47 we're aware of, and yet I've had
several friends commit suicide,
7010.07 had my undergrad advisor
committed suicide.
7012.68 The point is not
them or their story.
7014.97 The point is what in the
world dictates whether or not
7020.35 somebody who has a community,
who's doing well and then less
7027.33 well decides to offer themselves
to end their own life,
7032.72 versus decide I'm
going to keep going?
7035.872 I mean, this is I'm
raising this as a question.
7037.83 I wish I had an answer I used to
have ideas like, Oh, it's time
7040.22 perception.
7040.73 These people are so miserable,
feeling so miserable
7042.92 that they feel it's
going to go on forever.
7044.39 But then you start reading
the literature on suicide,
7046.598 and I've started
to go into this.
7048.08 For those of you
that can stomach it,
7049.25 and I don't know that I
want to recommend this movie
7050.93 but I'm just going to say it
exists, the movie The Bridge
7053.33 where they fix the camera on the
Golden Gate Bridge for a year,
7055.955 it turns out one person a day
on average tries to jump off.
7059.42 They talk to a guy
who survived it.
7061.13 By the way he jumped off the
moment he went off there.
7063.56 He thought I wish
I hadn't done that.
7065.81 He survived.
7066.68 This kid with bipolar.
7067.73 Bipolar disorder, especially
males, 20 to 30 times
7070.43 higher incidents of suicide.
7073.04 Massive increase.
7076.79 The point is that
there's something
7079.82 that happens in the brain
where somehow people also
7083.54 will get the idea, and you hear
this, that this is something
7086.84 they're excited to
do, or that they're
7089.21 going to write the world
somehow by doing this,
7091.85 or that somehow it's like
a gift to themselves.
7094.823 Again, I'm not encouraging
anybody to do this.
7096.74 I want to be very clear,
but these are the things
7098.06 that you hear.
7098.96 And sadly, your community
has lost a number of people
7102.62 through suicide, and yet there
are a lot of guys that thrive.
7108.97 And so more as a
template for trying
7110.58 to understand mental health and
depression and suicide, what
7114.81 are your thoughts on why
some people seem to thrive,
7120.68 and some people just
go all the way down?
7123.95 JOCKO WILLINK: Clearly, that's
a very complex question,
7127.28 and there's probably a
lot of different answers.
7130.62 And I certainly am not one to
be able to answer that question.
7136.12 However, probably
where my thought
7143.03 has gone on this
lately because I've
7145.723 known some guys that have
killed themselves and I've
7147.89 been totally shocked, and just
been completely and totally
7154.02 shocked that guys that I
knew killed themselves.
7157.8 Guys that you would
think, Oh, this guy
7160.17 would never do this
in a million years.
7162.94 And that's the feeling I've
had about a lot of the guys
7165.6 that I know that have
killed themselves.
7169.51 I had a woman on my podcast
named Sarah Wilkinson,
7172.96 and she's an awesome woman,
and she was married to a SEAL.
7177.61 His name was Chad.
7178.69 I didn't know him.
7182.465 He killed himself.
7186.29 And to hear her
describe the story,
7191.44 the shocking thing
about the story
7193.69 is that the guy that she
knew, the guy that she married
7201.4 was not the same guy
that killed himself.
7207.11 Something happened to him that
made him a different person.
7215.84 And look, they're getting
all this information
7220.4 now about CTE and the brain
trauma that you go through,
7226.91 and people are exposed to that.
7230.41 And I think if you've ever
seen George Foreman, he
7234.73 seems totally normal and
good to go, and Muhammad Ali,
7237.67 not so much.
7238.45 And I've known
fighters, and you can
7241.15 look at any number of boxers
that have had a career,
7244.18 and some of them are
fine, and some of them
7247.0 have some real significant--
7249.37 what is it?
7249.87 Pugilistic.
7252.06 There's a pugilistic syndrome.
7254.01 They've been punched too
much and they have problems.
7257.61 You can expose different
people to blast impact,
7262.74 and it's going to have a
different impact over time.
7265.0 And I think that, again, to
hear Sarah explain that story
7271.4 and what she saw
from her husband
7274.1 and how different
he was when they
7276.35 got married compared
to where they ended up,
7279.95 it's totally different.
7281.15 A totally different person.
7283.75 I had another friend of mine
on who named Marcus Capone,
7288.19 and his wife came on with him,
and she said the same thing.
7292.72 The guy that she married
was not the same guy
7297.39 that was ready to kill himself,
and he didn't, thankfully.
7301.83 It was a different person.
7304.08 Look, if Fred is
married to some woman,
7309.24 and Fred and Jessica
grow apart over time
7312.99 and he ends up with some other
girl, it's still the same guy.
7316.62 it's still the same guy that
is now, look, they grew apart,
7319.95 they're getting
divorced, we get it.
7321.76 But the way that both of
them described their husbands
7326.19 as being different people.
7329.84 That's what stuck with me
more than anything else.
7333.501 So I-- again, I'm
throwing this out there
7339.3 only because it's what I've
observed through the people
7341.94 that I know, and
seeing and hearing
7345.97 those stories of people
being totally different.
7351.22 And I've known a few people--
7353.38 one of my friends,
Dave, killed himself.
7355.36 I never would have
guessed in a million years
7357.235 that Dave would kill himself.
7358.94 It just it doesn't compute.
7360.97 It doesn't compute.
7362.65 And so my suspicion is there
has to be something going
7367.06 on mechanically or chemically
with the brain that causes them
7373.45 to get into a mode
where they're depressed
7377.92 and they don't see a
way out, and that's
7380.55 the way they feel now.
7381.54 And again, what's
interesting about this is
7383.73 we already talked about the
fact that the selection process
7387.93 weeds out guys that are
going to take a loss
7390.6 and not be able to get up again.
7392.22 No, you've got--
7393.33 SEALS can take a loss
and get back up again.
7395.305 That's what you learn
how to do in bed.
7396.93 Well, that's what you-- you
don't lean how to do it,
7399.097 you have it.
7399.85 And if you make it
through that training,
7401.558 you have that ability to
take a loss, all right, cool.
7404.07 Shake it off, get
back up, keep going.
7405.78 They're going to do that to you.
7407.9 So now you've got guys
that are taking a loss
7410.36 and they don't see
a way out anymore,
7411.96 in fact, to such a
point that they're
7413.502 going to take their
own lives, it's
7418.235 my suspicion is at some point
they're going to figure out
7420.61 that this exposure to the
adrenaline, the explosions
7427.767 all the time--
7428.35 I mean, you go out
to a range-- just
7430.34 in peacetime-- you
go out to a range,
7432.25 and you shoot a Carl Gustav.
7434.873 And you're a range
safety officer,
7436.29 so you go out there
with every guy that's
7437.998 shooting a Carl Gustav, it's
a big, giant, like bazooka
7440.37 looking weapon.
7441.3 And every time you shoot it, it
rattles your cage a little bit.
7444.12 Well, if you're a range safety
officer, and you're out there,
7447.03 and you're going to watch
everyone in the platoon
7449.13 shoot three of those, it's
going to have an impact.
7452.85 Then you go overseas,
and you're a breacher,
7455.73 or you're part of
a breach team--
7457.29 I mean, I had a time
where one of my guys
7461.32 were doing an assault
on a compound.
7463.5 I'm on the ladder--
7464.94 most buildings in Iraq
have a wall around them.
7467.05 So the way we would conduct
these raids, put the ladder up,
7469.83 the assault--
7470.73 breach team would
climb over the ladder,
7472.65 and I would go right
behind the breach team,
7474.597 and I would stand on the ladder.
7475.93 So I'm looking at the
building, observing,
7478.445 making sure there's
no waking up,
7479.82 make sure there's no threats.
7481.57 And then as I'm watching,
this guy in particular,
7484.14 he puts the breach on the
door, explosive breach,
7486.293 so he's going to
blow the door up.
7487.71 He's got his little
team with him.
7489.36 He puts the breach on the door.
7491.202 He starts to back away, and
there's like an obstacle there.
7493.66 It was like a freaking table,
or a lawn chair, or something.
7496.2 And he couldn't get around it.
7497.763 And I'm sitting there.
7498.68 It's dark.
7499.16 I mean, it's the
middle of the night.
7500.09 It's 2:00 o'clock
in the morning.
7501.02 And I'm like, I wonder
what he's going to do.
7502.895 And he seem stuck for a second.
7504.865 And then I just
see him lay down.
7506.24 And I'm like oh, he's just
going to take this thing.
7508.407 And sure enough, three
or four feet away
7511.07 from this breech point, he
lays down and just clacks off
7514.88 this explosive charge.
7516.92 And I jump over the wall.
7518.46 And as I'm going in, I'm trying
to get the rest of the platoon
7521.42 to go and commence this
assault. I look at him,
7524.79 he looked like he just
got hit in the head
7526.73 with a baseball bat.
7528.7 And guess what he
did the next night?
7530.29 Another breach on
another target.
7531.85 Guess what he did
the next night?
7533.225 Another breach on
another target.
7534.76 So you get guys that have
that exposure, which is--
7539.8 I mean, every seal
is eating a breach.
7541.6 I mean, you're
eating flashbangs,
7543.85 you're eating breaches,
you're shooting 50 cals.
7546.26 You're eating some
traumatic brain injury.
7550.1 But then you must
have some people
7552.58 that have some
genetic propensity
7556.48 to have this negative
thing happen.
7558.82 And I can only
guess, man, that this
7561.85 has something to do with
it because otherwise, we
7566.62 wouldn't be hearing so
many of these stories.
7568.57 And of course, we're just
talking about the SEAL Teams.
7570.862 We're not talking about the
military writ large, which
7573.64 is in the same exact boat.
7576.52 I'm also nervous about the
social contagion of suicide
7582.42 within the veteran community.
7584.43 I'm nervous about that.
7586.505 It's one of the
things that makes
7587.88 me apprehensive about
talking about it,
7589.38 but I obviously I've
talked about it.
7591.01 I've had people on my podcast
to discuss these things,
7594.45 but I am worried about that
social contagion of man,
7600.42 Fred did it.
7601.56 He got all this attention,
and he doesn't have
7603.57 to deal with anything anymore.
7605.64 I'm going to do it too.
7606.9 There's got to be some level
of that going on as well.
7611.64 So it's a horrible situation.
7613.97 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
the social contagion part
7615.97 is one that hits home from
a different dimension.
7618.012 The high school I
went to which is--
7619.72 name isn't important.
7620.68 But Gunn High School, G-U-N-N.
Gunn High School is famous
7624.91 for being one of the
better public high schools.
7626.91 Not that I attended as
much as I should have.
7628.89 I can tell you more about
the curbs in the parking lot
7630.63 than I could tell you
about the classes I took.
7632.588 And that's just not
encouraging people
7634.171 to not attend high school.
7635.255 Please do it.
7635.85 Took a lot of really hard
work to climb back up
7638.295 to where I should have
been when I graduated.
7640.17 But it has an
infamous reputation,
7643.95 or I'll say reputation
as an infamous school
7645.84 because it's one of the
highest suicide rates than any
7648.0 of the schools in the
country because there's
7649.38 train tracks that
run through town,
7650.838 and there was a contagion
of kids throwing themselves
7653.19 on the train tracks.
7654.09 This was happening a lot.
7656.28 This was written up in
various newspapers, et cetera.
7658.56 Fortunately, it seems
to have died down.
7660.24 Again, I'm also hesitant
to talk about this
7662.862 because no one
wants to spark this.
7664.32 But there does seem to be
something about lack of ability
7668.16 to see into a future obviously.
7670.17 Or the future that
people are seeing into
7671.97 is so dark that somehow they
lose touch with the idea
7674.91 that emotions come and go.
7676.2 You said it about motivation,
emotions come and go.
7679.56 But somehow people
lose touch with that.
7681.54 And then I will venture a guess.
7683.91 And here I'm hoping someone's
going to figure this out
7686.16 at some point so
we can have a more
7688.07 concrete conversation
about the mechanisms
7689.82 and what to do about it.
7690.82 But I think there's also
something about identity,
7693.64 about loss of a place
to put one's energy.
7698.46 Something useful in the world.
7699.78 If you're agenda-- what
you're talking about here
7701.88 are guys that are generators.
7704.31 They are not projectors,
they're generators.
7706.59 They live to have effective
action on the world for good
7711.42 and then end up
killing themselves.
7713.76 In youth, it's a little more
complicated to put a finger
7717.15 on because what's
going on there.
7719.61 We assume depression.
7721.02 But then in learning
more about suicide,
7723.39 there is also this
excitement for certain people
7726.36 about solving
something that seemed
7727.89 unsolvable any other way.
7729.37 And again, I'm certainly
not encouraging this.
7731.37 I-- strongly discouraging people
from taking their own life,
7734.22 obviously.
7735.48 But something about time and the
loss of perception about time.
7739.873 And one thing that
we know for sure here
7741.54 we can really hang
our hat on something
7743.28 is that if you do the forensics
on somebody that was suicidal,
7749.34 attempted, or took their
life, in the preceding
7752.86 days and weeks, their sleep-wake
schedule was completely wacked.
7757.93 They exit the normal
routine of most people.
7761.62 They isolate through
inversions of time.
7765.42 And I do wonder
sometimes whether or not
7767.155 the vampire ships,
as they're sometimes
7768.78 called, the
nighttime deployment,
7770.1 and the back and
forth, I mean, that's
7771.683 a lot for a system to take.
7773.52 Shift workers kill themselves
far more than nonshift workers.
7777.09 So I do think there's
something there.
7779.11 And again, I'm not
saying everyone needs
7780.777 to be in bed by
9:00 and up by 4:00.
7782.897 Although that would be a great
schedule for most people.
7785.23 But I do think that there are
some universal laws of what
7788.37 makes the human body
and brain healthy.
7791.58 And if you violate
those laws long enough
7794.52 with CTE, or with disruption
in your schedules,
7797.55 you run the risk, especially if
there's a predisposition there.
7800.49 And then other factors
start to layer in.
7802.71 Again-- and I have to
apologize because I
7804.9 don't have any real answers,
or more biology, or psychology
7808.38 to firmly throw out
this except the warning
7810.655 for people who are bipolar or
know somebody with bipolar.
7813.03 They are 20 to 30 times more
likely to kill themselves.
7815.82 And males in particular
are more likely to use
7817.77 methods that will kill them
in the first time as opposed
7820.103 to survive.
7820.87 There's a big sex
difference there.
7823.05 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
7824.28 You throw alcohol in there too.
7828.32 And Marcus is running
an organization now
7830.52 where they're taking vets
down to do the psychedelic--
7835.405 what do they call it?
7836.28 A journey.
7836.88 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
this is Veterans Solutions?
7838.44 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
7839.28 ANDREW HUBERMAN: They
are a great organization.
7840.84 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
7841.14 ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I
should mention a very
7842.01 bipartisan organization.
7843.45 I attended one
event on Coronado.
7845.52 And there were people
from the far-left,
7847.187 the far-right politicians,
and everything
7848.895 in between talking about
how critical this is.
7850.83 So this is not a
political issue.
7852.33 This is a mental health issue.
7853.99 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, and even
when I reflected on Marcus
7856.68 talking to me, he
was talking about how
7859.44 he's in this downward spiral.
7861.258 Part of the downward spiral,
he was drinking every day.
7863.55 And I'm thinking to
myself, man, like--
7867.58 I didn't think of
it during the show.
7869.17 I was thinking
about it afterwards.
7871.33 I was thinking, man, if
you're drinking all the time,
7874.88 you're on a downward spiral.
7877.66 That's one thing you
should just stop.
7881.59 Let's stop that immediately.
7883.78 So I just wanted to
throw that out there.
7886.02 I think that's another sign
from the outside looking in.
7890.44 If someone's self-medicating
with alcohol,
7893.23 it's not a good place,
not a good place.
7895.473 They're not in a good place,
and they could probably
7897.64 use some help.
7898.82 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I appreciate
you saying it again.
7900.01 We did this episode on alcohol.
7901.302 I went into it
totally open minded.
7902.81 I've never been a big drinker.
7903.7 I've had it.
7904.2 I can drink or not drink.
7905.47 I was never really
into drugs at all.
7909.083 Dabbled a little bit
when I was younger.
7910.75 I regret it frankly.
7912.01 Brain is plastic early
on, I didn't need that.
7914.02 Never did hard drugs.
7915.1 Never touched cocaine,
amphetamine, or anything
7917.058 like that.
7918.4 And if I had, I would say.
7919.92 I'm comfortable enough in my
position in life that if I had,
7922.42 I'd certainly say.
7923.35 But I think that it's pretty
clear that alcohol is bad
7928.3 for us certainly past a
certain two drink a week limit.
7931.63 People especially with a
propensity for alcoholism
7934.48 or who are dealing with other
issues, that's especially
7937.39 the case for not drinking.
7939.73 And I guess we've gotten into
some hard territory here.
7942.46 But I think if this
conversation cues up
7947.06 an awareness to anybody,
which I hope it would,
7950.03 either people that are in
that space of wondering
7952.325 if they should continue or not,
or that know somebody who might
7954.95 be, I do think that the
takeaway is very clear,
7959.47 which is that there are
ways to avoid these traps
7964.49 and to avoid making
these traps worse.
7966.59 And I think with regular
sleep-wake schedules,
7969.05 understanding that--
and I wrote this down
7971.24 that you've particular have
said several times that
7975.56 rather than looking for sources
of things outside like a job,
7978.59 or a relationship,
which are all great.
7980.6 But as sources of energy, or
motivation, or inspiration,
7983.24 to use positive action
as a source of energy.
7986.54 I think is just--
7987.68 if I could put that up on a
billboard in Times Square,
7991.34 I would.
7992.33 And I'd put your
name next to it,
7994.2 which is that positive
action is a source of energy
7997.58 that then you can
recycle into more things.
7999.84 I think--
8000.34 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
8000.79 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --going back
to the fundamentals, right?
8002.59 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
8003.423 And positive action is when you
have to contend with something.
8006.7 When there's something that
you're afraid of, step into it,
8009.49 move towards it.
8010.543 That's how you're going
to solve that problem.
8012.46 You don't you don't
solve problems
8013.877 by running away from them.
8015.31 You solve them by
moving towards them
8018.07 and figuring out
what's going on.
8020.29 And I mean, alcohol is
obviously a clear way
8022.18 to avoid the problem at least
for the next four hours.
8025.688 And you wake up, and that
problem is still there.
8027.73 And that's not good.
8029.44 But when you've got some
problem-- and listen,
8032.26 then we could go
down the whole path
8034.18 of talking about the
indirect approach, which
8036.79 is a theory of combat which
I completely believe in.
8041.66 But it also applies to
interacting with other people.
8045.13 If you have a problem with
some other person, to think,
8047.937 oh, I got a problem with Andrew.
8049.27 I'm going to go
confront him on it.
8051.13 And that might not
be the best solution.
8053.107 In fact, it's probably
not the best solution
8054.94 for me to go confront
you with the problem
8056.68 because now we're going
to have a confrontation.
8058.68 It might be better for me
to take an indirect approach
8061.24 and not confront
you but instead,
8063.105 engage in a
conversation with you
8064.48 about something that's maybe
adjacent to the problem
8067.45 that I have.
8068.08 And then eventually that
builds our relationship
8070.3 to a point where you
start to recognize,
8072.44 oh, I bet Jocko feels
something about this thing.
8075.28 And we can move towards a
solution instead of me trying
8078.49 to punch you in the
face with some truth
8081.31 that I believe versus the
truth that you believe.
8083.59 And now we're engaged in
combat, and that's bad.
8086.288 There's going to be casualties.
8087.58 I'd rather take an
indirect approach
8089.56 and build a relationship
where we can solve problems
8091.78 in a more positive way.
8093.682 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that.
8094.89 And I love it because
it really speaks
8097.08 to the power of thinking
carefully and being
8100.17 patient and a little
bit slower at times.
8103.095 I also heard you say
something earlier that's
8104.97 still flagging in my mind,
which is not thinking too much.
8110.47 I think seems to be a time
where thinking too much
8113.86 is very dangerous.
8115.24 And again, we can
keep the discussion
8117.52 that we were having
about mental health,
8119.415 or we could even just call it
what it is, mental illness.
8121.79 I think everyone would agree
suicide is some reflection
8124.54 of an unhealthy state.
8127.088 We can keep that in the
backdrop as we talk about this,
8129.38 but this isn't necessarily
only about that.
8133.73 You seem to have an
ability to engage in things
8136.697 without thinking too much.
8137.78 And yet also to sit back
and be pretty observant.
8141.95 And you've talked about
third personing of the self.
8144.815 I'd love to talk a little
bit more about this
8146.69 even though it's a topic
you've delved into before.
8149.04 And in particular the
topic of meditation.
8151.22 I've been reading
more about meditation.
8153.93 I've meditated for different
stretches in my life,
8157.44 different amounts of time.
8159.13 And there are two basic
forms of meditation
8161.55 that I only recently
learned about.
8163.77 One is a focused
attention meditation.
8166.335 Your sitting, closing your eyes,
focusing on your breath, body,
8169.47 body surface, or
even a visual target
8171.63 in your environment
and just focus.
8173.43 And we know that enhances
one's ability to focus.
8176.867 If you do too late
in the day, it also
8178.45 enhance your ability
to not fall asleep.
8181.06 A lot of people don't realize
that meditation too late
8183.31 in the day, if it's
a focused meditation,
8184.87 you're just ramping
up the activity
8186.34 in the prefrontal cortex.
8187.58 It's a great tool for
getting better at focusing.
8191.44 But then there's also
this type of meditation
8194.11 called open observer meditation
where you purposefully
8197.29 don't include a target in
your mind, or in your vision,
8200.709 or in your hearing.
8201.76 And you just sit there, eyes
closed, your eyes open, and you
8205.03 go into a place of
whatever comes up,
8209.44 but you don't hover
there too long.
8211.78 The goal is to not
hover on any one thing,
8213.969 which sounds like deliberate
attention deficit disorder.
8217.28 But it's actually a
pretty cool method
8219.34 it turns out for
restoring our ability
8222.67 to engage in focus but also
for one particular thing
8226.24 that you mentioned earlier,
which is creativity
8228.879 and creative problem solving,
which of course, requires
8231.49 accessing, let's
just say, more colors
8233.77 on the palette than
your vision might be on.
8235.809 Realizing, oh, there's
also all these other colors
8238.09 over here in the
periphery that I'm missing
8239.882 because I'm hyperfocused.
8241.99 Do you meditate?
8242.91 If you do meditate, is it
more of an open monitoring
8246.299 or a focused meditation?
8247.75 And if you don't do a
standard meditation,
8249.959 are there times throughout
your day, and your routine,
8252.209 and your week where as
I'm describing this,
8254.879 it maps to something that
feels like open monitoring
8258.629 or focused meditation?
8260.4 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, so
no, I don't meditate.
8262.53 I haven't ever.
8263.85 I don't think I've
ever actually meditated
8265.92 for one second in my life.
8267.299 And I--
8268.334 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And I refuse to.
8269.709 JOCKO WILLINK: --no, no,
it's not that at all.
8271.626 I know Sam Harris
sent me his app,
8273.052 and we were going
to do a podcast.
8274.469 And I said, dude, I'll
do it for two weeks,
8276.261 and we'll do a podcast, and
I'll be more enlightened
8278.615 and everything.
8279.24 And I didn't even give
Sam Harris two weeks.
8281.1 So I still owe Sam Harris two
weeks on his app of meditation
8285.27 so we can see how it impacts me.
8287.01 But no I've never
done it before.
8288.87 I've never tried to do it.
8290.52 And that being
said, if the goal is
8294.54 to take a step back and
detach from what's going on,
8297.9 I do that all day, every day.
8300.1 And so that is something
that I've talked about,
8303.69 and it's something
I tried to teach.
8305.7 I tried to teach the
young SEAL leaders not
8308.959 to get caught up in
what's happening right
8310.709 in front of them
but to take a step
8312.167 back, detach from the situation,
detach from their emotions.
8315.76 See more of what's happening.
8318.6 You're talking about seeing
more colors of the palette,
8321.09 well, on the battlefield,
I want people
8322.98 to be able to see more
angles, more maneuvers, more
8326.91 opportunities, more of
what the enemy might do,
8329.549 more perspective.
8330.389 That's what I always
try to achieve.
8333.61 And so I'm sorry, I
apologize, I can't give you
8337.17 any good discussion
on meditation
8338.969 because I haven't tried it.
8340.86 ANDREW HUBERMAN: No
apology necessary.
8342.99 But I will ask,
when you go surfing,
8345.18 and you're sitting in the
water waiting for a wave,
8347.549 are you focused on one
particular location
8349.83 on the horizon, or are
you in open monitoring,
8353.25 just enjoying just bouncing
up and down in the water.
8355.68 Like where is your attention
during activities like that?
8358.657 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
8359.49 So surfing-- oftentimes
surfing, you're a monkey mind,
8363.296 and you're just not
thinking about anything.
8365.129 Same thing with jujitsu.
8366.129 Also with surfing, if
you're waiting for a wave,
8369.02 your mind is just going.
8371.01 I mean, it's in another
universe sometimes as you're
8373.482 sitting there waiting because
you're just looking out
8375.69 at the horizon.
8376.59 And your mind-- I mean, my mind,
I'm thinking about all kinds--
8381.389 I have to come home
sometimes and write notes
8383.83 because I thought of this,
I thought of an idea,
8385.83 I thought of a perspective.
8386.85 That happens to me at jujitsu.
8388.1 That happens to me talking
to people where someone's
8390.455 talking about something,
I'm like oh, I
8392.08 got an idea right now.
8392.85 I would go write that down.
8393.975 I have to go and write it down.
8395.5 I have notes in my phone
like pages and pages
8399.15 and pages of notes in my
phone of ideas that I have,
8402.06 and I write them down.
8403.258 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you
voice memo things or do--
8405.3 JOCKO WILLINK: No, I type them.
8406.04 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --yeah.
8407.04 JOCKO WILLINK: I only need
to type like seven words on
8409.62 and then I have the
whole ideas in my head.
8412.248 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I put a lot
into the notes in my phone
8414.54 as well.
8415.04 And it probably looks like
gibberish to a lot of people.
8417.75 I go back through them when
I'm on the plane, especially
8420.66 problems I was challenged with
10 years ago or something.
8423.253 And I look like, oh,
my God, I'm dealing
8424.92 with the same thing, different
situation, same me, right?
8429.99 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
8430.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We had
an amazing psychiatrist
8433.38 on the show, but I'd love
to hear a conversation
8436.62 between the two of you.
8438.42 His name is Paul Conti.
8439.705 He was trained at
Stanford and Harvard.
8441.33 He's an amazing guy.
8443.79 Actually, talks openly
about the tragedy
8446.39 that his brother killed
himself, which was
8448.14 what drove him into psychiatry.
8449.85 And he's an interesting guy
because he's obviously highly
8452.67 educated, incredibly smart.
8454.32 He wrote a book on trauma, but
he has incredible knowledge
8457.05 about a number of other
areas of psychology,
8459.07 including narcissism,
sociopathy.
8461.22 He's worked in a lot of
really interesting domains
8463.56 with interesting people
that everyone listening
8465.69 on his podcast would recognize.
8467.86 Of course, he's not going to
reveal who those people are.
8471.18 And he talks about
the fact that you
8477.22 can look at different people.
8478.978 He was actually the one that
shared with me this notion
8481.27 of generators and
projectors, and directed me
8484.65 towards that literature.
8485.65 But when he came
on the podcast, he
8488.65 talked a little bit
about that stuff,
8491.11 but he talked
mostly about trauma.
8493.29 But then we were
talking about ways
8496.47 in which people engage in the
world and different archetypes.
8499.59 And how you start looking at
stories throughout history,
8502.98 and you start seeing the
same themes over and over.
8505.71 Westerns, this
idea of a guy rides
8508.11 into town and does
some repair work like
8510.84 defeats the sinister
person or things
8514.022 that are imposing all the time
then rides to the next town.
8516.48 It's always like it ends with--
it's going to keep continuing.
8518.94 But then when he got into this
discussion of relationship,
8521.357 he talks about-- he said this
on the podcast of a patient who
8524.22 said, I've been in 10
abusive relationships.
8528.72 And he'd say to that
patient, no, you've
8530.79 been in one relationship 10
times, which is essentially
8534.3 it's all about your issue.
8537.14 That's not you.
8538.22 I'm not-- purposely didn't point
at you for those listening.
8541.52 And I think that those
features of ourselves
8544.31 that we bring from condition
to condition can be negative
8547.43 or they can be positive.
8548.51 One thing that's
interesting-- and here I'm
8550.82 not trying to solve or
understand the SEAL team
8553.367 community per se, but
I think they represent
8555.2 an important archetype
because they are selected
8557.51 for this ability to take
hard conditions and failures
8562.52 and turn them into wins.
8563.6 That's one of the selection
criteria, seems to be.
8567.02 They're finding who
has that capability.
8570.49 I see a lot of-- and I happen to
know a few people from the SEAL
8573.52 Teams who get out
and do really well.
8577.638 They have great business.
8578.68 You're a shining
example of this.
8580.18 And you have a
family, and you know
8581.78 you've got German shepherd too.
8583.27 We'll talk about
animals in a little bit.
8584.35 You have a dog.
8584.98 And it's like you
surf, and you train.
8586.563 And I'm sure you have your
dark places, dark moments
8589.66 and challenges
like anybody else,
8591.16 but things look to me like
they're going pretty well.
8593.69 And then I also know
people from the SEAL Teams.
8596.05 OK, they don't go down the
path of suicide fortunately.
8598.9 But it's they don't do as
well as I would have thought.
8603.62 And I'm certainly not
picking on this community.
8605.66 I also see this from people
who are professional athletes.
8608.077 I know kids that were
phenomenal in high school.
8610.767 I mean, these are
like early admission
8612.35 to all the Ivy League
schools because that
8614.1 was what happened in the
town that I grew up in.
8616.28 And I look at them now, and
I'm like, wow, That-- gosh,
8620.19 it didn't-- somehow
it's not working out.
8622.398 And I think it's
important for people
8623.94 to hear that yes, winning
creates the propensity for more
8627.15 winning.
8627.99 But then why do you think
it is that in a community
8633.02 where people are trained to
solve problems, adapt, and make
8636.14 things work, some people
flourish outside the military,
8640.1 and some flourish
less, and some--
8642.86 we already talked about--
really go down the dark traps.
8646.46 What do you think is
the quality that allows
8648.98 people to be really adaptable?
8650.99 In particular, because most
of us live in a landscape
8654.14 where we have to deal with
people who are not us.
8657.26 Like people that are not
good at what we're good at.
8660.487 And sometimes that's an
asset, sometimes it's not.
8662.57 You seem to be particularly
good at understanding
8665.39 the human animal and
working with that.
8668.34 So again, this is
a broad question.
8670.378 We're going very broadband here,
and we'll get narrower again
8672.92 in a little bit.
8673.587 But I'd love your
thoughts on why is it?
8675.77 How is it?
8677.36 What determines
whether or not somebody
8679.25 thrives in novel environments?
8681.605 JOCKO WILLINK: I have
to start off just
8683.23 by saying I wrote a note
as you were talking.
8685.69 I just put SEAL and then
I put the not equals sign.
8689.32 Because you can't say that
a SEAL equals anything.
8692.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Excellent point.
8694.6 JOCKO WILLINK: I
mean, there's guys
8697.0 that have been in the SEAL
Teams that are murderers.
8700.83 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like
real life murderers.
8702.58 JOCKO WILLINK: Like murderers.
8703.83 Like rapists and murderers that
went through SEAL training.
8706.48 Rapists, murderers,
and they're in prison
8707.95 for the rest of their lives.
8709.117 Like that's a thing.
8710.14 There's people that have been in
the SEAL Teams that got kicked
8713.86 out of SEAL Teams for drugs.
8716.35 I mean, you name it,
and we've got that.
8718.93 And we've got guys that are just
lazy, and we've got guys that--
8722.098 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And physicians-- you
8723.64 could say this about physicians.
8724.973 There have been sociopathic
serial killer physicians
8729.785 and then there are ones that
are in third world countries
8732.16 right now that would not
accept $1,000,000,000 to stop
8736.78 serving people at the
level of the basic medicine
8739.78 that they deserve.
8740.8 JOCKO WILLINK: So
there's the seals
8742.6 that get out and just volunteer
to go help in the worst
8745.917 places in the world.
8746.75 So you've got a full
spectrum of people.
8749.44 So to say a SEAL equals
success in any domain,
8753.82 the only domain you can
say that they're successful
8756.408 is they made it through
basic SEAL training
8758.2 because guys make it
through basic SEAL training,
8759.61 and they're not good SEALs.
8761.2 That happens.
8762.55 So you get guys that make it
through basic SEAL training,
8765.772 and they make it through
SEAL qualification training,
8767.98 and they make it to
a SEAL team, and they
8769.723 get kicked out of the SEAL Teams
because they're not good SEALs.
8772.39 They weren't meant
to do that job.
8774.94 That happens.
8776.0 So all they've proven by making
it through basic SEAL training
8779.05 is they can suck
it up for a while.
8780.82 And there's also guys that make
it through basic SEAL training
8783.85 because they learned how to
maneuver through the system.
8786.22 They learned what
to do, and what
8787.607 the minimum requirements
were, and how
8789.19 they could skate through this.
8789.91 There's guys like that.
8791.35 It's not a huge number, but
they're absolutely there.
8794.093 ANDREW HUBERMAN: We
see them in science.
8795.76 People that go to a lab, figure
out who the director of the lab
8799.66 is at the level of psychology--
and this is actually
8802.225 one of the more dangerous
aspects of science.
8804.1 It actually negatively
impacts all of society.
8806.47 I'll just say it.
8807.465 And any scientist will know
what I'm talking about.
8809.59 They find the big famous
labs, they figure out
8811.96 who that leader of the
lab is, and they get
8814.21 that person the data they want.
8815.93 They might not make the data
up, but they will certainly
8819.79 discard the data
that don't fit, which
8822.7 is one way of making
data up by exclusion.
8825.67 It's not literally like
painting pictures of cells
8828.13 that aren't there or something.
8829.422 But that happens a lot, and
those people often go far.
8832.27 They rarely go all the
way because pretty soon
8835.39 their reputation
expands to the point
8838.03 where people go like, yeah,
no one can repeat that result.
8840.61 But these people sit
in very high positions.
8842.92 Not at Stanford.
8844.135 I will say, I don't know
any of my colleagues
8846.01 at Stanford that
meet those criteria.
8849.46 But you see them, and you
see what they're doing,
8853.48 and they're basically solving
a social engineering thing.
8856.45 They just happen to be
doing it in science.
8858.342 Now, why anyone would
do that in science?
8860.05 I don't know because you
don't get rich in science.
8861.79 You certainly don't get famous.
8862.87 But for whatever
reason, they figured it
8864.58 out that that's where
they're going to do it.
8865.9 And I'm sure you
see it in law firms.
8867.1 I'm sure you see it in
every single domain--
8868.99 JOCKO WILLINK: Everything
8869.54 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
8870.31 JOCKO WILLINK: Now,
you pointed out
8871.768 that there's some people that
make it to the Ivy League
8874.39 schools, and they graduate
from an Ivy League school,
8876.598 and they don't do well.
8877.59 And to me, that's very similar
to someone that might make it
8880.09 to the SEAL Teams, do
well in the SEAL Teams,
8882.11 and then they get out,
and they don't do well.
8884.38 It's probably because of what
I talked about earlier when
8887.02 I went to Navy boot camp.
8888.637 Here's what you got to do.
8889.72 If you do it well,
you'll be rewarded.
8891.8 Well, if you're in high school,
and your mom and dad say, hey,
8895.25 if you do good in
high school, you're
8896.952 going to get into this
Ivy League school,
8898.66 and you get into that
Ivy League school.
8899.98 And here's what you need
to do in high school,
8901.69 you need to get good grades.
8902.62 You need to be part
of the Glee club.
8904.213 You need whatever the things
are that you got to do.
8906.38 You've got to speak
a different language.
8908.088 You've got to go volunteer in
Guatemala in the summertime.
8910.603 You've got to do these
things, and then you'll
8912.52 get into the good college.
8913.6 Once you get into
the good college,
8914.59 you've got to get this degree.
8915.64 Once you get that degree--
8916.723 So they've had a path laid out
for them of boxes to check,
8920.227 and they go and check the boxes.
8921.56 And then when they
get done, no one
8923.527 has put any more boxes
out in front of them,
8925.36 so they don't know what to do.
8926.68 And that can certainly happen
from someone in the SEAL Teams,
8931.39 or someone in the military
that what they've been-- hey,
8933.935 this is your mission.
8934.81 This is what you've got to do.
8935.74 Here's what you need
to do, do it well.
8937.55 Check the box.
8938.187 Check the box.
8938.77 Check the box.
8939.25 Check the box.
8939.67 And then it's time to retire,
and there's no one putting
8942.003 a box in front of him to check.
8943.42 And so unless someone--
8945.67 some guys get out
of the SEAL Teams,
8947.17 and they go into a big corporate
structure, and they kick ass.
8949.76 Because there's someone in
the corporate world saying,
8952.01 hey, here's what
you got to do next.
8953.15 And they do great.
8954.01 And that's super good for
them, and they actually
8956.11 really like it.
8956.92 I was talking to a
guy the other day.
8958.06 He's like full on
in a corporation.
8959.518 He's doing a great job.
8960.96 He likes what he's doing.
8962.08 It's awesome.
8964.12 But I think you get some
guys that they don't really
8968.35 have the open mind to see
where opportunities are.
8972.883 And one thing that's
nice about the SEAL Teams
8974.8 is there's a lot of--
8978.58 you get a lot of
freedom of maneuver.
8980.26 You can really do a lot of
stuff that you want to do.
8983.485 And so when they look
at the corporate world,
8985.36 they don't see that,
and they think,
8986.38 oh, I'm not going to do that.
8988.01 But then they're not quite
sure how to take the next step.
8992.157 So I think that's why you
might see some guys that
8994.24 aren't super successful
because they don't really
8999.43 know what to do.
9000.72 And they don't really
have a mind that's
9003.57 open to look for opportunities.
9006.85 And also you got some
guys that success for them
9009.092 is they're going to hang
out with their family,
9011.05 and they're going to
get in good shape,
9013.39 and they're going to run some
triathlons or compete in--
9015.97 whatever they're going to do,
they're going to go do it,
9018.303 and that's what they're looking
to do, which is also awesome.
9021.37 Go take time, go enjoy
your family, man.
9023.65 You gave enough to your country.
9025.24 Go hang out with your kids.
9026.93 That's success as far
as I'm concerned too.
9029.228 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I agree there.
9030.52 I know far too
many people who are
9032.14 successful in their
professional lives
9033.73 but who have very
diminished personal lives,
9035.77 and it is not a pretty picture.
9037.78 You mentioned the parent driving
the kid, do this, do that.
9043.39 In that scenario, I
sense tons of fear.
9045.94 It's all about not
being a failure.
9047.74 It's not actually about love of
your craft or what you enjoy.
9052.023 Pretty early in
my science career,
9053.44 I learned that there are certain
people are just ambitious.
9056.14 They just like to win.
9057.23 And I used to joke around.
9058.743 It's not polite,
but I used to go,
9060.16 we should all just
tell that person
9062.89 that the new cool thing
is trying to understand
9065.47 the biology of like--
9066.97 and I would say
feces or something.
9068.708 And they'd probably work on it.
9070.0 They'd be like, yeah, it's
like the greatest thing
9071.47 because they actually don't
care what they're working on.
9073.06 For them it's just the hunt.
9074.56 And I learned that
actually people like that
9076.69 can serve an important role
because like well, there's
9080.293 actually a whole microbiome.
9081.46 There are actually labs
that do work on feces,
9083.377 so forgive me my colleagues
that work on microbiomes.
9085.69 But in all seriousness,
people who are just ambitious
9090.495 can be very
effective because you
9091.87 put a problem in front of
them, and it's like a dog,
9093.58 they'll just retrieve.
9094.6 It's they're just go.
9096.04 As opposed to love
of retrieving--
9098.77 for retrieving sake.
9100.09 It's like you give that same
dog-- the analogy here would
9102.67 be give that same
dog a high jump,
9104.087 and they're into high
jumping, or whatever
9105.85 it is, or diving underwater.
9107.53 But I think of people
more like animals and more
9111.58 like different dog species.
9113.14 Like we-- as your case was
with music, particular music,
9117.94 and communities, or the example
of shopping for the pants
9120.94 and that experience
of the first time
9122.71 you tap into something that
really feels unique to you.
9125.62 You're like there's
something here.
9128.2 To be able to find work that
includes that but also is
9131.71 hard and also allows
you to evolve over time,
9134.24 I mean, I think that's
the real gift that I
9137.98 think most people are seeking.
9139.63 And of course,
there's no shortcut
9141.79 to that except
perhaps one, which
9143.62 is to be able to sense the
difference between ambition.
9146.83 And there's no
better word for it,
9148.615 let's just call it what
it is, which is love.
9150.49 Like I love this.
9151.99 And the reason I think
that love is so powerful--
9154.133 and here I'm sounding
like Lex Fridman--
9155.8 but I don't mean
interelational love.
9158.35 I mean, being able to sense what
that feels like is that I do
9164.63 believe that it allows us to
tap into an enormous number
9168.83 of things that fear alone and
ambition alone and just being
9173.69 a hard driving person alone
will not allow us to tap into.
9177.35 Things like
adaptiveness, creativity.
9180.915 And I think there's a really
obvious reason for it, which
9183.29 is that the one thing we
know about our species
9185.81 is that we want to
make more of ourselves
9187.76 and to take good
care of our young.
9189.26 Whether or not everyone has
kids or not is irrelevant.
9191.51 The point is that every species
not only wants to do that
9194.06 but need to do that.
9195.23 And the feeling
of love is really
9197.48 what allows us to be adaptable.
9199.08 I don't think there's anything
that trains up adaptability as
9202.22 much as being around kids.
9204.57 You just have to be
adaptable because they're
9206.663 one moment they're
up then they're
9208.08 down then they're disappointed.
9211.38 And you shared a
really important story
9213.81 about loss of somebody
that clearly you loved
9216.57 and that clearly loved the
community he worked in.
9221.725 It wasn't just that
you guys loved him,
9223.35 It's that he loved you guys.
9225.45 And I think that being able to
tap into these feelings of love
9229.26 for things, for people,
and for experiences,
9232.29 I think is so critical.
9233.83 And I don't meditate
much these days,
9237.03 but I have heard of this
love and kindness meditation.
9239.82 And it sounds so soft to me.
9241.043 I was thinking like, gosh,
what am I supposed to do?
9243.21 Then float like
levitate at the end?
9244.89 And wear a mumu or
whatever it's called.
9248.05 I don't know what's the thing.
9249.3 But my friend who I'm
fortunate to call a friend.
9251.928 Not trying to name
drop here, but I'm
9253.47 very fortunate to call
Rick Rubin, the music
9254.97 producer, a friend.
9256.05 And he was the one
who started turning me
9258.63 on to different
forms of meditation,
9260.13 the ones I mentioned before.
9261.297 And this idea that there
are forms of meditation
9263.38 which put us in touch with
what he calls the source.
9267.513 Now, this is really
getting a little mystical,
9269.43 but I think this all maps
back to the same thing, which
9272.04 is that there are
sources of dopamine
9274.57 and the other
neurotransmitters in us that
9277.14 give us a super power
to adapt to anything.
9281.67 And I think it's at
least includes love
9287.13 because that's the most
adaptable emotion by definition
9289.74 because of what's
required for evolution.
9291.64 So the question
therefore is, in yourself
9295.41 and in your observation of
people that you've worked with,
9298.49 did you ever sense that just
being hard driving was great
9304.44 but it was limiting?
9305.99 Did you ever sense that
by liking the people
9308.18 you work with you could perform
much better even if they
9312.02 perhaps were not as hard--
9314.57 to kind of borrow the common
parlance around this--
9317.87 they weren't as hard
as everybody else?
9319.76 That because you
like each other so,
9321.92 so much that you
can do anything?
9324.8 JOCKO WILLINK: Well, if you
have a team of 10 people,
9328.89 and you all have a
great relationship
9330.51 and you get along well, and
you're going against my team
9332.843 and we all hate each
other, who's going to win?
9335.51 ANDREW HUBERMAN: The team
that loves each other
9336.47 is going to win, I would hope.
9337.73 JOCKO WILLINK: It's
not even close.
9338.88 It's not even--
a matter of fact,
9340.255 if you work for me
and you don't like me,
9343.04 what performance are
you going to give me?
9344.9 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
going to be tough.
9345.93 JOCKO WILLINK: What
if you love me,
9347.3 and I've looked out for you, and
I've done everything for you,
9349.89 and I've taken care of you,
what kind of performance
9351.59 are you going to give me?
9352.52 Everything you've got.
9353.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I'd die for you.
9354.495 JOCKO WILLINK: So
yeah, earlier you
9356.93 asked about the human
animal and human nature.
9360.21 And this is part of leadership.
9363.347 I got asked this question
the other day by--
9365.18 I was working with a company.
9367.1 And the guy says,
how do I identify--
9369.83 what are the characteristics
of someone that can execute,
9372.53 and how do I identify those
characteristics in a person
9376.58 so that I can get those people?
9378.8 And I said, well, first of
all, the characteristics
9383.145 are the characteristics that
everybody is-- obviously,
9385.65 someone that's driven, someone
that communicates well,
9387.33 someone that's going
to make things happen,
9389.122 those are pretty simple to know.
9390.48 We know what they are.
9391.47 How do you identify them?
9392.512 It's pretty simple as well.
9393.93 I give you a task.
9395.25 I give Andrew a task.
9396.51 It's pretty simple task.
9397.77 If you get it done, cool.
9399.48 Give you a little bit
more complex task.
9401.688 Do you get it done?
9402.48 Yes.
9403.18 I give the same task to
Fred, he doesn't get it done.
9405.443 He comes back with a
bunch of questions.
9407.11 He slow rolls it.
9407.818 He's got all kinds of
excuses and problems.
9409.61 I give you an even
more complex task,
9411.27 you come back, you get it done.
9413.13 And then I'm going
to realize, OK,
9415.0 Andrew is the guy that
makes things happen.
9416.85 He's a guy that can
actually execute.
9421.35 A little bit what you said.
9422.56 I mean, there are certain breeds
of dogs but even that is--
9426.48 they're not as different
as human beings are.
9432.93 And there are-- so now
there are some guys--
9435.33 I've got Andrew who
will make things happen.
9438.15 Here's the problem with Andrew.
9439.68 When I say, hey, Andrew, here's
this nebulous idea that I have.
9445.24 Can you turn this
into a reality?
9446.83 And you're like,
where do I start?
9449.44 I'm not sure where
you want me to go.
9451.01 Meanwhile, I gave
it to the guy that
9452.51 didn't make anything happen with
specific tasks that I gave him.
9455.95 And he comes back and says--
9457.337 I said, hey, I got
this nebulous idea.
9458.92 Can you see-- he goes, oh yeah.
9460.51 And all of a
sudden, he takes it.
9462.01 He says, hey, I figured out
a way to make this happen.
9464.26 So you might have someone
that's very good at executing,
9466.64 but they're not very creative.
9467.83 I might have somebody
that's very creative,
9469.39 but they're not very
good at executing.
9471.13 So what do I do?
9472.51 I build a team where
I've got Andrew and Fred,
9474.91 and they work together.
9475.96 And Fred comes up
with good ideas,
9478.06 and we bring them to Andrew, and
Andrew goes and executes them.
9480.8 So that's what we're
doing from a leadership
9483.34 perspective is we're letting
people's nature execute.
9489.49 We're putting people
into roles where
9492.76 their nature is beneficial.
9495.17 I'm not going to take someone
that's shy and introverted
9498.437 and put them out in
a lead sales role.
9500.02 I'm not going to
take somebody that's
9501.562 boisterous and extroverted
and put them into a cubicle
9504.345 where they're
going to be looking
9505.72 at spreadsheets all day.
9507.01 Clearly, I'm not
going to do that.
9508.58 So what we have to
do as leaders is
9510.4 we have to find the right
people for the right role,
9512.71 and we place them
into those roles.
9514.46 Now, does it mean
that I abandon all
9516.67 hope that the guy
that's an introvert
9518.29 will ever develop more
communication skills?
9521.068 No, I'm still going
to work with him.
9522.61 And over time, we'll
get him a little bit
9524.71 moving in the right direction.
9526.353 But I'm not going
to take somebody
9527.77 that's a total
introvert and turn them
9532.12 into a lead sales guy.
9533.11 That's not going
to happen anymore
9534.73 than I'm going to change
a tiger's stripes.
9536.522 So that's what we have to do
is we have to help people--
9540.9 as leaders, we have to
help people find the role
9543.18 and find the thing
that they're good at.
9545.43 Now, does that mean if I have
someone that loves their job,
9550.32 they're going to
do better at it?
9551.85 Absolutely.
9553.29 Does it mean that
if I have somebody
9555.33 that's driven just
by achievement
9559.09 that they're going to
be good at their job?
9560.95 No.
9561.52 In fact, well, they can be.
9563.223 There's going to be certain
roles I can put them in.
9565.39 If I've got a sales
number I need to hit
9567.057 and Andrew is super
into achievement,
9569.43 he wants to be the
golden child, he
9571.24 wants to have his
picture on the magazine
9574.87 that we put out about
our industry, cool.
9577.6 I can throw this task
at you, and you're
9580.36 going to go and get it.
9582.2 The problem is if
there's something that's
9584.8 going to take more perseverance
and the reward isn't that high,
9588.31 or it's a long-term
goal, you're probably not
9590.89 the right guy for the job.
9592.6 So liking your job is
absolutely critical.
9597.77 And if you love your
job, you're going
9600.1 to be able to most
likely excel at it.
9601.96 Now, you could be an unfortunate
person that loves your job
9604.75 and is not good at it.
9605.86 That happens occasionally.
9607.36 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, but it seems--
9607.9 JOCKO WILLINK: It's like--
sure reminds me of your--
9609.4 ANDREW HUBERMAN: But
it seems pretty rare.
9610.39 JOCKO WILLINK: It reminds me
of your skateboarding career.
9612.13 You loved skateboarding, but you
just weren't that good at it.
9615.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
wasn't that good at it.
9615.88 JOCKO WILLINK: Unfortunately.
9615.94 ANDREW HUBERMAN: You what I
loved more than skateboarding?
9618.357 I loved the community I was in.
9619.87 I loved the community I was in.
9621.993 And I probably would have
gone to the industry side,
9624.16 or worked on a company
side and not been
9626.38 on the actual skateboard side,
or just skateboard for fun.
9628.94 So there's a guy in the
skateboarding community.
9630.94 His name is Jim Thiebaud.
9631.982 And he's the not-so-hidden
secret in that community.
9635.327 He's an amazing guy.
9636.16 And he early on left
professional skateboarding
9640.06 to run a company, Real, Deluxe,
a bunch of other companies.
9642.707 He's an amazing guy.
9643.54 And he told me--
9644.207 we've become friends
recently-- and he
9645.79 said he realized he wasn't
going to be one of the big guys,
9648.553 but he knew he wanted
to be in this community,
9650.47 so he found his place.
9651.568 And I think everyone
in skateboarding
9653.11 looks to Jim as like the guy.
9657.25 He truly cares about the
sport and about the people.
9660.41 And so he learned to
just wrap his arms
9662.11 and his heart around the whole
thing, and it just works.
9664.55 And so I do think everyone has
a certain place in a community
9669.4 or in a team.
9670.24 I think that as you're
describing this,
9671.98 I have to imagine that people
are listening and thinking,
9675.58 wow, this team thing is awesome.
9678.85 It's just amazing.
9680.06 I wish I had that.
9681.49 I'm fortunate to have
that in my podcast.
9683.26 I've had that in my lab.
9684.31 Certainly, in my
podcast team, I always
9686.83 say, these guys go, I go.
9690.26 It's not just people that press
buttons, and run equipment,
9693.14 take photos.
9693.8 They go, I go.
9694.79 They go, it's over.
9695.75 And I'm fine with that.
9696.96 I actually love that
because yes, it's
9699.2 about the podcast and
about the information
9701.39 and getting it out there, but
it's as much about the team
9703.82 and working together just like
it was with skateboarding.
9706.02 So hopefully, I'm
better at podcasting
9707.69 than I was at skateboarding.
9708.65 I kept getting broke off
as the skateboarders say
9710.45 in skateboarding too often.
9711.575 But I want to ask
in your family life,
9714.38 do you look at that as a team?
9715.94 Do you think this is my
team, and they're different
9719.03 and how can we synergize?
9720.32 JOCKO WILLINK:
Yeah, and you've got
9721.37 to look at every team like that.
9722.42 What are the strengths and
weaknesses of the team?
9724.503 And who's going to
be good at what?
9726.11 And how do you put people
in positions where they're
9728.87 going to be able to excel?
9730.55 I mean, what's his
name, Thiebaud?
9732.18 Is that--
9732.68 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jim Thiebaud.
9733.37 JOCKO WILLINK: Jim Thiebaud?
9734.36 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
9735.277 JOCKO WILLINK: Imagine if he
had a mentor that was saying,
9738.41 listen, you got to
be a pro skater.
9740.69 This is your only opportunity.
9742.11 There's nothing else.
9743.03 And he didn't have the ability
to take a step back and say,
9745.7 you know what, man, I'm not
going to be good enough,
9749.69 but I really love this industry.
9752.96 So luckily for him
he figured that out.
9756.44 And you talked
about the superpower
9758.48 of being like loving your job.
9760.34 The one thing I claim to be
a superpower is the ability
9763.55 to take a step back and
detach, which I guess
9765.56 is going back to your
meditation thing.
9767.185 But being able to take a step
back and look at your life
9771.23 and say, man, I've
been skateboarding
9773.423 longer than that guy,
and he's better than me.
9775.34 And I've been skateboarding
longer than that other guy,
9777.632 and he's better than me.
9779.245 I'm probably not going to
be-- this probably is not
9781.37 the right job for me.
9782.64 What could I do where I
could use my skill set?
9785.81 And obviously, he had some
entrepreneurial spirit
9788.32 and was able to figure that out.
9789.99 So being able to be
a part of a team.
9792.86 And it goes to what I was
saying earlier about the mob.
9795.56 Being able to be part of
a team, part of the mob,
9797.72 part of the gang but
still have the ability
9799.88 to take a step back,
detach from that,
9801.65 and assess what is the best way
for this team to move forward.
9806.73 I mean, you could have
this brilliant idea
9809.3 that from now on you're going
to make all of your podcasts
9813.17 about the molecular
structure of whatever.
9819.44 And the rest of
the team probably
9821.0 need to pull you
aside and say, hey,
9822.5 man, I know you really care
about that, and that's awesome,
9825.32 but everyone really wants to
hear about this other stuff.
9829.71 So let's tie it in together.
9831.6 Let's expand what the specific
thing you want to talk about.
9834.57 So being able to take
a step back, detach,
9836.93 and see the bigger picture to me
is the true superpower of life.
9843.86 And it's a lot harder
than it sounds.
9846.65 And this goes back
to when you start
9849.77 talking about people that
are going through struggles
9853.85 in life.
9854.99 And I've described this before
as if I'm looking at you,
9859.37 and you're in a bad state.
9862.04 You're depressed.
9863.18 You're sad.
9864.02 You're moping around.
9865.1 You're not getting
anything done.
9867.82 And I'm looking at
you from the outside,
9869.77 and I'm thinking for me,
I see this storm cloud
9873.1 around your head.
9874.09 I see the storm cloud
around your head.
9876.1 And you're in there, and
all you see no matter what
9881.14 direction you look is storm.
9883.06 All you see is darkness.
9884.662 I'm outside and I'm looking,
oh, hey, man, this guy's
9886.87 got a great education.
9887.86 He's healthy.
9888.76 He's got a good team around him.
9890.243 He's got all these
things going for him.
9891.91 But you in that state, you
literally cannot see anything
9898.24 but the darkness of the storm.
9900.29 And that's what's so scary
about when people enter
9904.24 that mode is you can look--
9906.073 I can look at it from
the outside and be like,
9907.99 Andrew, you've just got to
move like four feet forward,
9911.08 and you're going to
be through this thing.
9912.85 And yet you might hear me say
that, and you go, no, Jock.
9915.88 I'm looking ahead, there's
nothing but darkness.
9918.34 So helping people move
forward, take action, and be
9922.33 able to get that
perspective, detach,
9924.61 and get outside themselves,
get outside their own heads.
9928.167 Tim Ferriss said get
out of your head.
9929.75 Get into your body.
9930.542 That's one way to do it.
9931.82 Take action.
9932.47 Go do things.
9933.37 But it's very scary.
9935.313 And I'm sure you've had
this experience where you're
9937.48 talking to someone that
you know, and they're
9940.99 bogged down in
whatever problem it is,
9943.42 whatever stress they're under.
9945.88 And you're looking
at them going, hey,
9947.71 man, it's going to be OK.
9949.9 You can clearly
see that whatever
9953.11 is bothering them and dragging
them, now, you can clearly see.
9956.71 A lot of times it's
a relationship.
9958.69 The girl or the guy
they got dumped,
9961.45 and you go, hey, man, that
person was a disaster anyways.
9963.91 You're better off without them.
9965.5 And they cannot compute that.
9967.54 They are stuck there.
9968.87 Or maybe it's the school
that they didn't get into,
9971.11 or the job that they didn't get.
9972.46 And they get so
wrapped up in that.
9974.41 They can't get
out of that storm.
9977.08 And it's such a helpless feeling
to sit there and tell someone,
9983.29 hey you just move a
little bit towards me,
9987.85 and you're going to
get out of this storm.
9989.9 And it's so much
easier said than done.
9994.06 And that's why trying
to engage with people
9995.947 and trying to give people that
super power of detachment where
9998.53 they can take a
step back and say,
9999.61 you know what,
you're right, man.
10001.2 That girl she wasn't who
I really thought she was.
10004.95 I should move on.
10005.82 Yes.
10006.75 But easier said than done.
10010.093 And that's one of the
biggest challenges
10011.76 I think that we have
as friends and parents
10015.36 and teammates is helping
people learn to detach,
10022.14 learn to see the bigger picture,
learn to see that the problem
10025.77 that you have that your
whole world is actually
10029.58 not that big of a deal.
10031.15 I've written a bunch
of kids' books.
10032.65 And one of the things that
triggered me to write kids
10035.01 books is realizing that-- one
day my daughter came home--
10040.26 it's my oldest daughter-- and
she came home from school,
10043.68 and she says, I'm stupid.
10046.86 What do you mean you're stupid?
10048.27 I'm stupid.
10048.84 I'm dumb.
10049.393 Why do you think that?
10050.31 You know whatever grade
it is when you're supposed
10051.9 to know your timetables?
10053.28 I don't know my timetables.
10054.87 I said, oh, well, how
much have you studied?
10058.59 She gave me the confused look.
10061.29 What do you mean studied?
10063.21 I said, have you studied
yet have you made flashcards
10066.23 to learn them?
10068.03 And she didn't.
10069.23 She hadn't.
10069.747 She thought she
should just know them.
10071.33 From the teacher went
over what they are,
10072.93 now she should know them like
some other kids in the class
10075.347 did.
10076.692 And so I'm sitting there
going, oh, yeah, cool.
10078.65 We'll make some flashcards.
10080.07 And she made flashcards.
10081.07 She learned her timetables in
45 minutes, and we were good.
10083.99 But what struck me was to me,
I was like, oh, no big deal.
10088.83 To her, it was her whole life.
10090.913 And then I got to see
that with my other kids.
10092.83 Somebody said something to
them in the recess yard.
10095.23 And I'm like, oh,
screw that kid.
10096.85 They don't know what--
10098.08 don't worry about them.
10099.23 But when you're-- that's
their whole world and that
10104.43 unfortunately doesn't
only apply to kids.
10107.43 It applies to adults as well.
10109.26 And they get this
problem in their world
10113.4 that seems so insurmountable
and so massive
10117.3 because that little ecosystem
that they're stuck in
10120.15 is their world.
10121.29 And they run into
this problem, and it's
10123.96 disruptive in that
world, and they don't
10126.33 know how to get out of it.
10128.403 I did a podcast talking
about these ecosystems
10130.32 that people get into.
10131.195 And there's all
these ecosystems.
10132.57 You're in an ecosystem.
10133.77 We're both in a shared
ecosystem of podcasting
10136.95 and we could be
like, oh, my gosh,
10141.035 Lex just came out
with a new podcast,
10143.24 and it's been the
biggest success.
10145.28 And what can I do to
catch up with Lex?
10148.248 And all of a sudden, I
could get really bothered,
10150.29 you could get really bothered,
we could be bothered by that.
10152.79 And think, man, I'm a failure.
10154.28 Meanwhile, there's people
that don't listen to podcasts.
10157.25 There's people that don't
even know what a podcast is.
10159.62 And yet it's our whole
world if we let it be.
10162.59 You're in the academic world.
10164.03 Hey, you go-- you're a
professor at Stanford, which
10168.32 is a big deal in that world.
10172.17 I know people that
don't give a rat's ass.
10175.65 They don't know
where Stanford is.
10177.27 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
get that all the time.
10178.17 JOCKO WILLINK: They don't
know where Stanford is.
10179.16 It's no big deal.
10179.91 In the SEAL Teams, same thing.
10181.26 Somebody has a problem
in the SEAL Teams,
10183.76 and they think this is the
whole world, and I blew it.
10187.41 And now what are
they going to do?
10189.15 When you're facing a
significant problem
10191.34 in life, a relationship,
a problem with a job,
10194.46 you got to remember that
you're in one ecosystem,
10196.8 and if you step outside of that
ecosystem, no one really cares.
10200.49 And you could go move into
a whole totally different
10202.74 ecosystem and find
happiness there.
10205.5 But at least utilize that
to get out of that storm
10209.22 cloud that you're
in, and you're going
10210.89 to find that there's plenty of
light out there in the world.
10213.39 Move towards that and it's going
to be a much better situation.
10217.75 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, in the spirit
10219.25 of authenticity, everything
you're saying hits
10221.68 directly home for me.
10224.078 I don't know what people's
perceptions of me are.
10226.12 I actually try not to spend too
much time thinking about that
10228.662 and just really try and stay
in touch with the source.
10231.34 And I really do believe in this
notion that our love of things
10235.36 is what can generate energy.
10236.59 And I try and use action
to generate energy
10238.69 but also I happen to
also love exercise.
10240.562 So that's an easy
one there for me.
10242.02 But I try and stay in that mode.
10244.19 But to be quite honest, I've
spent much of my adult life
10248.44 and probably too much of
my teenage life and 20s--
10253.57 you're not quite an
adult in your 20s,
10255.37 at least I certainly wasn't--
10257.2 in challenging relationships
that admittedly
10263.25 were challenging because of my
role in them also, of course.
10267.39 And each and every
time, I remember
10270.42 thinking, moving on from this is
like this insurmountable thing.
10274.11 In part because I am a
caretaker, and I cared.
10277.08 And it wasn't just about
me and a selfishness,
10279.447 it was about wanting
to right all the wrongs
10281.28 of that person's past.
10283.17 I found myself trying to be
a time machine for people.
10286.05 I found myself trying to
fix their family lives.
10288.33 I found myself doing
all of that and also
10290.73 ignoring all the things
I need to focus on
10292.65 in terms of bettering myself
and making sure I was showing
10295.71 up correct and on and on.
10297.93 And there are data in the world
in the form of these people
10302.01 that know me very, very
well that I think would
10304.95 say that and a whole lot more.
10307.62 The point isn't those
specific relationships
10309.63 but each and every time someone
would come along and say,
10314.97 listen, if this isn't good for
you, it's not good for them,
10317.94 or this is a bad
situation, or this isn't
10319.785 serving either of you well.
10320.91 But I was myopic, this big.
10323.7 And not even soda
straw view of the world
10325.59 like sand speck of the
world and trying to solve
10328.838 because that's my nature.
10329.88 I'm going to solve this.
10330.61 I'm going to solve it.
10331.18 I'm going to solve it.
10332.097 And sometimes things were
solved for some period of time
10334.69 and sometimes they weren't.
10335.83 And I think one thing that just
as a confessional, I will say,
10343.02 I could really learn
the art of detachment.
10347.81 I could really learn
to focus on that more,
10350.798 if that's the proper
language for it.
10352.34 I think I'm pretty
good at adapting.
10355.25 I think I'm pretty good
at finding good people.
10357.57 I'm certainly love
my team, and that all
10360.5 feels like natural
synergy although it's
10362.21 hard work in lab
and in the podcast.
10364.31 But I think the tendency that
I have as a problem solver
10369.35 is to assume that every
problem can be solved,
10371.69 and therefore, staying on this
problem until it is solved
10374.54 is the answer.
10375.74 And maybe the art of detachment
and getting some perspective
10380.03 would help because
if I look back,
10381.78 I certainly don't regret the
experiences that I've had.
10384.2 But I wasted far too much time.
10386.42 And frankly, I probably
wasted far too much
10388.37 of other people's time
trying to solve problems
10391.01 that could not be solved.
10392.85 And I think without going
into this in any more detail,
10397.91 and of course, you can send me
a bill at the end by the way.
10402.27 I think--
10402.77 JOCKO WILLINK: Confessions
sessions are free, man
10404.12 ANDREW HUBERMAN: --yeah.
10404.33 So I think that being a
problem solver is great,
10406.7 being forward center
mass is great.
10408.17 I think learning the systems
of the brain and body
10410.6 and understanding psychology
and learning about oneself.
10414.17 The Oracle had it right,
know thyself in ways
10417.23 that you can
maneuver functionally
10419.33 in your life and career and
relationship, et cetera.
10421.7 Great.
10422.2 But I think there's
also a downside
10423.92 to being overly fixated.
10426.08 It's like my bulldog,
Costello, used
10427.58 to be like chewing on
something, chewing on something.
10429.17 Next thing I know he's
chewing on his foot.
10431.445 And you're like, hey.
10432.32 And you'd have to rip
him off his own foot.
10434.112 He'd be like--
[PANTING] --because that
10436.13 chew reflex was just so
strong that sometimes it
10438.32 would turn on himself.
10439.63 That's how it feels.
10441.287 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I wrote a
book called Leadership Strategy
10443.87 and Tactics.
10444.38 And one of the things that
I wrote about in that book
10446.72 is understanding what's
important and what's not.
10449.4 And this is very similar to
what you're talking about.
10452.84 Looking at a problem
and taking a step back.
10456.11 And going, well, A, is
this important or not?
10459.56 And B, is this
solvable or is it not?
10461.91 And C, what's the ROI
on getting it solved?
10464.09 And what's the effort
it's going to take
10465.14 to get this problem solved?
10466.265 And how much is it really going
to impact my world and my life
10469.13 if I focus on it?
10471.44 So knowing and
understanding when
10474.44 something is important or
not is a very good skill.
10478.07 And again, it's a skill that's
directly related to detachment.
10481.37 Because when you're
in that relationship--
10483.77 this is another thing I've
been telling people lately--
10486.236 the solution to
your problem is not
10488.75 going to be found
in the problem.
10490.28 It's not going to
be found in there.
10491.78 You have to get
out of the problem
10493.5 so that you can look at
it, make an assessment.
10495.95 And you can assess how
to solve the problem
10497.84 or whether you need to
solve the problem or not.
10500.04 I mean, there's a lot
of things in my life
10501.89 right now where I shrug
my shoulders and go, OK.
10505.17 But-- It's OK.
10507.24 Oh, someone's saying this, OK.
10510.1 Roger that.
10512.14 Carry on.
10513.34 No factor.
10514.54 Move on.
10516.37 And then occasionally,
you go, OK, this
10518.14 is something I need
to contend with.
10519.19 This is something I
need to deal with this.
10520.3 This is something I need
to shape or adjust or move
10523.03 or solve, to use your word.
10527.2 The reason I laugh when I
say that is because problems
10532.47 you have to get in there.
10534.07 But if you take a step
back, you can usually
10536.19 say, oh, a little
adjustment here,
10537.75 a little adjustment
there, and that thing
10539.458 is going to sort itself out.
10540.66 So detachment is a superpower.
10544.297 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Certainly
is and it certainly one
10546.38 that I need to focus on more.
10548.42 I'm grateful for you
bringing that up.
10552.59 This is the biologist
in me, but what
10556.58 is your process for engaging
detachment or for disengaging?
10560.36 Is it an active
process, where you go,
10562.61 I'm going to detach from this.
10564.08 I'm going to put myself
in a situation that
10565.97 is pulling on me.
10567.26 There's this
gravitational force,
10568.7 and I'm going to create some
imagery in my mind of walking
10571.79 away from it.
10572.48 Do I physically
walk away from it?
10574.34 Do I outsource it
to somebody else?
10576.3 What are some tools
for detachment?
10577.923 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, this is
one of those situations where
10580.34 you and I had a discussion
about the science
10582.8 and the practical
application aligned.
10586.07 So my original experience
with detachment
10590.62 was-- and this is one
of those moments where
10592.87 I said a lot of times things are
just small moments over time,
10595.6 and you make a
little adjustment.
10596.975 This is one of those
moments in my life.
10599.493 And I wrote about in
Leadership Strategy and Tactics
10601.66 where I recognized like in
a moment what detachment was
10607.74 and how helpful it was.
10608.82 I'm on an oil rig doing
a training mission.
10613.26 My whole platoon is
in a skirmish line
10616.38 looking at a large
area of the oil rig
10619.742 that we're supposed
to be clearing.
10621.2 Again, this is not combat.
10622.29 This is in the 90s.
10623.082 There's nothing going on.
10624.123 We're just doing training.
10625.23 And I'm standing in
the skirmish line.
10627.563 And by the way, I'm the
youngest and most junior guy
10629.73 in my platoon.
10630.45 And I'm standing there looking
down the sight of my weapon,
10633.84 and I'm waiting for
someone to make a call
10635.67 and tell us what to do.
10637.71 And I wait for 5 seconds,
and I wait for 10 seconds,
10640.29 and I wait for 20 seconds,
and no one's saying anything.
10642.75 And we're waiting for
a leader in my platoon
10645.99 to make a call to tell us what
to do, to tell me what to do.
10650.09 And finally after 30 seconds
which seems like an eternity,
10653.87 I can't take it anymore.
10655.55 And so I take a step like a
foot, a 1-foot step, 12 inches.
10661.06 I take a step off
the skirmish line.
10663.52 I look to my left.
10664.528 I look to my right.
10665.32 And what I see is every
other guy in my platoon
10667.96 is staring down their
weapon, staring down
10670.42 the sight of the weapon, which
means their field of view
10674.05 is tiny.
10674.99 It's like a 20-degree
field of view.
10676.69 You're looking down the
scope of your weapon,
10678.7 or the sight of your
weapon, and that's
10680.5 how big their field of view is.
10681.48 And I'm looking,
and I'm thinking,
10682.897 oh, there's my
platoon commander.
10684.49 He's looking down the scope--
10685.8 the sight of his weapon.
10686.8 There's my platoon
chief, he's looking down
10688.09 the sight of his weapon.
10688.66 There's my leading
petty officer,
10689.68 he's looking down the
sight of his weapon.
10690.88 There's my assistant
platoon commander,
10692.02 he's looking down-- so
everyone in the platoon
10694.03 is looking down sight side
of their weapon, which
10696.072 means they all have a very
narrow field of vision.
10701.408 Well, when I take a step
back and look to my left
10703.45 and look to my right, guess what
kind of field of vision I got?
10705.52 I got a massive one.
10706.6 I can see the whole scene,
and I can see exactly what
10709.72 it is we need to do.
10711.72 And at that moment--
10713.312 look, as a new guy, you need
to keep your mouth shut.
10715.52 You don't say anything.
10717.29 And I'm thinking, well, but no
one else is saying anything.
10720.38 So I muster up all the courage
I can, and I open my mouth
10725.47 and I say, hold left,
clear right, which
10728.67 is a basic tactical call.
10731.01 No, this is not a
patent-level genius maneuver.
10734.235 It's just a normal call to make
in a situation that we were in.
10736.86 I say, hold left, clear right.
10739.32 And I'm expecting
to get slapped,
10740.88 told, shut up, new guy.
10742.42 But instead,
everyone just repeats
10743.88 the call, hold left, clear
right, hold left, clear right.
10746.255 And we execute the
maneuver, and we finish
10748.26 the clearance of this oil rig.
10750.39 And we get done,
we get to the top
10752.22 of the oil rig, which means
we cleared the whole thing.
10754.512 We're on the helo deck at the
top, and we go into a debrief.
10757.05 And now I'm expecting,
OK, now, I'm
10758.61 going to get told, hey,
what were you doing?
10760.443 You need to keep
your mouth shut.
10762.21 And instead, the
platoon chief goes,
10763.74 hey, Jocko, good call on
the cellar deck down there.
10768.73 And I was like,
yeah, that's right.
10770.732 But then I thought to
myself, hold on a second.
10772.69 Why if I'm the youngest most
junior guy in this platoon,
10776.74 why was I able to
see what we needed
10778.78 to do and make that call?
10780.43 Why did that just happen?
10782.51 And then I realized it was
because I took a step back.
10786.25 To use your term, I
broadened my field
10788.92 of view, which
allowed me to think
10791.62 more clearly because instead of
being hyperfocused and narrowly
10794.83 focused, I broadened
my range of vision.
10797.14 I took a breath
before I made my call.
10800.05 I had take a nice
breath to speak clearly.
10805.82 And I realized that taking
a step back and detaching,
10809.87 I got to see infinitely
more than even the most
10812.42 experienced guys in my platoon.
10814.71 And I started doing
it all the time.
10816.96 And I started doing
it in land warfare.
10818.94 I started doing it
in urban combat.
10820.53 I started doing it in all these
tactical training scenarios.
10823.31 These are just training.
10824.31 This is the '90s.
10824.94 I started doing these
training scenarios,
10826.648 and it always allowed me to
see what we needed to do.
10833.31 And then I started doing it
when I was having conversations
10836.5 with people.
10837.0 And having a conversation
with my platoon chief,
10838.59 and I can see that
he's starting to turn
10839.94 a little red in the face.
10840.982 And we're about to
argue about something.
10843.027 I said, oh, wait a second.
10844.11 I'm taking a step back look and
go, he's getting mad right now,
10846.735 and he's the platoon chief.
10848.1 You better just de-escalate
this thing real quick.
10851.315 And I'd say, hey, you know
what, chief, that sounds good.
10853.69 Let me go relook at
the plan or whatever.
10856.96 And so I started to do
this with my normal life.
10861.9 It was to not get wrapped
up in my own emotions.
10864.48 Not get wrapped up in the gun
fight that was happening right
10867.84 in front of my face.
10868.92 Not to get wrapped up in the
details of what was going on,
10872.4 but instead, take a step
back, detach, look around
10877.56 and then you can make a
much, much better decision.
10880.71 And it's not-- it's exponential.
10885.55 If you're looking down
the sights of your weapon,
10888.14 and you take a step back,
and you look around,
10890.96 it's exponential how
much more you can see.
10893.45 Now, listen, if you are the
only person in a gunfight,
10896.12 it's going to be harder for
you to do that because you've
10897.47 got to be focused on
whatever you're shooting at.
10899.512 But when you have 16 guys
or 20 guys they're all
10902.105 looking in the same
direction, it's very easy
10903.98 to be the guy that goes,
I'm going take a step back,
10906.24 look around, make a call.
10908.97 So when you talk
about the mechanics--
10911.99 when I teach this
to people now--
10914.3 the mechanics of it, take
a step back literally.
10918.58 You and I are at
a meeting, there's
10920.442 a bunch of people this starts
to get heated argument,
10922.65 I will literally push my chair
back away from the table.
10926.04 Change my perspective.
10929.22 Widen my field of view.
10933.49 The other thing in the SEAL
Teams you don't want to sound
10937.21 panicked on the radio
for a couple of reasons.
10940.86 Number one, because when
you panic on the radio,
10942.86 it's going to cause
other people to panic.
10943.97 Number two, if you panic
on the radio, and you sound
10946.1 panicked, everyone's
going to make fun of you.
10948.05 So when you get back
from the mission
10949.07 everyone is going to go--
10949.52 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Double whammy.
10949.82 JOCKO WILLINK: --yeah.
10950.09 You sounded like
a baby out there.
10951.98 So what would I do before
I would key up my radio,
10956.4 take a breath.
10958.06 And so here I'm manually
slowing down my breath.
10961.8 I'm broadening my field of view.
10963.49 So if you're in a
meeting, or you're in a--
10966.75 you're at the
supermarket parking lot,
10969.27 and someone starts
to yell at you,
10972.18 take a step back, take a breath,
broaden your field of view.
10976.0 Detach from those
emotions that you're
10977.98 having and make some space.
10981.12 And that's how I go through
the mechanics of detachment.
10984.9 Now, I can tell you
right now I mean,
10987.7 when you do this all the time,
which I do this all the time.
10991.99 Yeah, I don't really
have to step back.
10993.838 But when you're starting to
be able to try and do this,
10996.13 absolutely.
10996.91 Make-- And I'll tell
you here's another
10998.71 like weird little nuance
thing, lift your chin up,
11005.3 and put your hands down.
11006.56 Now, this is not in a combat
situation, not in a fight.
11009.14 But here's the thing,
when I get defensive
11013.803 what am I going to do?
11014.72 I'll raise my hands up
and put my chin down.
11016.1 That's like a fighting mode.
11017.37 So if you and I are
having a discussion,
11019.1 and I'm starting to get heated,
and I'm starting to like,
11021.475 oh, he's not listening to me.
11022.73 Instead of me putting my chin
down and put my hands like
11027.29 up to where I can put them
in your face a little bit,
11029.54 no, I'm actually going
to take a step back
11031.29 and say, put my chin up.
11033.137 It changes my perspective
a little bit more,
11034.97 changes my visual
perspective just by changing
11037.55 the angle of my head.
11038.73 Take a step back,
put my hands down.
11040.338 I'm not being in a defensible--
11041.63 I actually want to hear
what you have to say.
11044.52 And if I start listening
to what you have to say
11047.0 and not talking--
11047.96 it's very hard to be
detached when you're talking.
11050.42 It's another key component.
11052.01 You want to detach,
shut your mouth.
11054.53 So I'm in meetings in a
bunch of different companies.
11058.465 I'm running-- I
have a bunch of--
11059.84 I own a bunch of
different companies.
11061.382 I'm in a meeting
in my companies,
11062.825 I'm not the one that's
doing all the talking.
11064.7 In fact, I'm doing
mostly listening.
11066.41 When I'm in Task Unit
Bruiser, my task unit,
11069.41 I'm not sitting there
giving the entire brief.
11071.875 No, I'm letting
the platoon chief
11073.25 and the platoon commanders
give those briefs.
11076.82 And that way, I'm detached.
11077.96 I'm listening to what
they have to say.
11079.79 I'm more capable of seeing what
holes there are in their plans
11085.28 by not moving my mouth,
not talking, I'm listening.
11090.08 So those are some of the
methodologies that I use
11092.84 and that I advise people to use
in order to effectively start
11097.58 down the pathway of being able
to detach in various scenarios.
11103.04 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.
11104.72 Again, I'm saying I love
it because I do love it.
11106.85 And thank you.
11107.57 I think it's a
wonderful technique.
11109.07 We've talked before
on your podcast
11110.66 and some of my listeners,
maybe not all to this podcast
11113.96 will be familiar with the
fact that when we narrowly
11116.33 focus our gaze on one target,
a number of things happen.
11119.45 Our visual world becomes
constricted, of course,
11121.85 but also that we start
slicing time more finely.
11124.67 And the dopamine
system tends to start
11126.74 doing anticipation and trying
to guide and direct things
11130.7 in that narrow tunnel of view,
whereas when we literally
11134.065 take on panoramic vision,
so not necessarily moving
11136.19 our head around,
although, one could,
11137.732 broadening our field of view
or looking at a horizon,
11140.15 especially if we're walking.
11141.35 But getting that kind of--
11142.64 not kind of getting a
broader field of view,
11144.83 we slice time differently.
11147.29 Things don't feel
as imposing on us.
11150.32 This is the physiological
substrate underlying
11152.9 what you're describing.
11154.17 And I think it
goes a step further
11156.86 because in that
open, larger aperture
11161.03 of visual understanding,
there's an open larger window
11164.24 of cognitive understanding, and
new options start to surface.
11168.38 I mean, I think this is--
11169.545 I have long been
fascinated by the fact
11171.17 that this actually became--
11172.295 I'll tell this real quick story.
11173.69 In 2015, I went over to Spain
to do some mountaineering
11178.7 with Wim Hof.
11179.84 And this wasn't because
I wanted a podcast.
11181.71 I didn't have any social media.
11182.57 I just went over
there because I'd
11183.41 heard this guy, Wim, contacted
him, and somehow arranged
11185.96 a trip for myself.
11186.71 And I went over there, and
we did some crazy dangerous
11189.47 mountaineering that I
had no business doing.
11191.87 Almost ripped my left
leg off in a stunt
11195.5 that was organized
by others there
11197.58 that I never should have done.
11198.83 In any case, one
day I look and Wim
11202.25 is like crouched
on the ground next
11203.81 to like a curb in this
parking lot before our hike.
11206.81 And he's down there on the
ground with a little stick.
11209.09 And I was like,
what are you doing?
11210.57 He's like, look.
11211.61 And there were ants
climbing up this thing.
11213.63 And he's like, there
mountaineering this curb.
11218.43 And I thought, this
guy's different.
11222.51 But then I realized we were
about to do the same thing
11225.36 up this big face.
11226.53 And I thought, wow, he's able to
think at these different scales
11230.25 and see similarities.
11231.24 That's pretty cool.
11231.84 I would have never
stopped to look there,
11233.548 and I still remember it.
11234.99 And was it profound?
11236.085 No.
11236.585 But was it interesting?
yeah, in the sense
11238.41 that things are happening
at all scales all the time.
11241.77 And we think we know the
scale to pay attention to,
11245.41 and we think that that's
the one that matters most.
11247.57 And I think it's fair to
say that in a gunfight,
11249.57 there is a scale
that matters most
11251.1 but new options, new
perspectives actually come
11254.37 from that broader
field of view, which
11256.077 is what you're describing.
11257.16 And later that day-- it's
interesting because this group
11259.68 going up, some of them were
really challenged in the climb.
11264.12 And Wim went back
to this example
11267.25 of how the ants would stack
on top of one another.
11269.402 And he used an analogy
from that to help people
11271.36 through this climb.
11272.16 And there was a beautiful
pool at the top,
11273.46 et cetera, et cetera.
11274.335 Anyway, I think
that these examples
11276.76 are in fact meaningful,
especially the ones
11278.92 that you gave because they
don't just relate to military.
11281.6 I mean, you can imagine
around the dinner table.
11283.6 I've had this.
11284.47 Kids are there and
partners there.
11286.27 And sometimes it's really
nice to sit back and just
11288.67 hear it all and bask in it all.
11291.1 But oftentimes, new
information will surface.
11294.52 Like you said, all I'm hearing
is worries out of this person.
11297.717 Or they're not even really here.
11299.05 They're all talking
about what we're
11300.55 going to do next time,
next time, next time.
11302.62 And you can reanchor people
like, hey, look, maybe
11305.38 let's focus on what
we're doing here.
11307.09 Or sometimes people
are hyperfocused
11308.71 on what's happening
there, and they
11309.64 need to think about
something in the future.
11311.29 I love this.
11311.827 I need to practice detachment
in a number of different domains
11314.41 in my life.
11315.64 One thing that I am realizing
after hearing you describe
11318.88 the process that I
really need to do
11320.5 is I need to start taking
some time away from my work.
11326.4 Maybe even a little bit of
time parallel to relationship
11330.06 to get better perspective on it.
11332.04 Because I think the problem
solving nature in us
11334.77 really makes us myopic,
really makes us nearsighted.
11337.65 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah that's--
11339.32 you see this a lot.
11340.75 I mean, I get to see this a lot.
11342.43 We do events with
companies, businesses.
11345.6 And we go offsite somewhere
where they're detached.
11351.47 They're just they're
defacto detached
11354.11 from their day-to-day business.
11356.095 You pull someone out of
their business for two days
11358.22 and all of a sudden, they
start seeing the solutions.
11360.65 They never see them like it's a
lot harder for them to see them
11364.25 when they're in the firefight.
11365.972 You get them out of the
firefight, it's hard for them
11368.18 to see it when they're in that
acquisition that they're doing.
11371.165 How are we going to
merge these two cultures?
11373.04 This is going to be impossible.
11374.332 Boom, pull them out.
11375.5 All right, let's talk
about the two cultures.
11377.39 And let's talk about what
possible outcomes are.
11379.97 And all of a sudden, when you
get them to take a step back,
11383.45 the solutions will appear.
11385.25 And it is true in a gunfight.
11387.03 Now, listen, if it's a
one-on-one gunfight, even then
11390.26 the ability to take a step
back and look around or use
11395.0 your peripheral vision, you
have to be able to do this.
11398.002 It's going to increase.
11398.96 It's exponential
how much it-- that's
11401.69 why it's like a superpower.
11402.96 It's like cheating.
11403.97 It's like cheating.
11405.44 I was speaking of Seth Stone.
11408.11 Seth Stone took over--
11410.91 he became a task unit
commander, troop commander
11413.4 when we got back from Ramadi.
11415.043 And so now he's
the guy in charge,
11416.46 and now I was
running the training.
11418.32 And a couple of months into his
training, he broke his neck.
11424.35 Broke his vertebrae in his neck.
11426.43 His spinal cord was OK, so he
was the guy with the big neck
11430.32 brace on, and he couldn't
do any arduous training.
11433.08 And his SEAL task unit,
which is two platoons,
11436.92 was going through their
land warfare training.
11440.01 And he couldn't do it.
11441.072 He couldn't carry a rucksack,
couldn't carry a machine gun,
11443.53 so he couldn't do it.
11444.508 So I said, hey, I'm coming out.
11445.8 Let's go out, and you
can observe your guys,
11448.08 and see how they're doing.
11449.89 And so there we are.
11450.96 We're out in the desert.
11452.13 His troop is going through
field training exercise,
11454.8 our full mission profile.
11456.15 So it's like a big
fake operation,
11457.59 there's a fake target,
there's fake bad guys.
11459.465 We're using these high
speed laser guns to shoot.
11462.72 And we're standing
on this little berm.
11467.31 And at a certain point
in the operation,
11470.22 his whole task
unit, like 40 guys,
11473.31 gets pinned down in
this little ravine.
11475.83 And so we're standing in
the ravine with these guys,
11478.29 and no one's making
any decisions.
11480.84 And the enemy with these laser
guns are starting to maneuver
11484.71 and starting to--
they're killing guys
11486.51 because these laser
guns you can die.
11489.39 And Seth he hits me on the arm.
11492.052 He said, can I tell
him what to do?
11493.51 And I was like, no.
11494.46 Let them figure it out.
11495.63 So another 30 seconds
pass, another guy
11498.93 gets killed with laser.
11500.91 He hits me again, bro, let
me say something to them.
11503.64 And I was like, no,
let them figure it out.
11506.07 Another minute goes by,
two more guys are now dead.
11509.88 Just laser dead
but they're dead.
11512.46 And he hits me again, and he's
like, bro, let me tell them.
11515.22 And I go, all right,
go ahead and tell them.
11517.38 And so he just crouches down
next to one of the guys,
11519.87 and bangs him on the
shoulder, goes, peel right.
11523.51 And which is again, it's just
a fundamental basic call.
11526.66 And the guy shouts
it out, peel right.
11528.52 And they start
peeling peeling right.
11529.36 And another minute later,
they're all out of the kill
11531.568 zone and everything's OK.
11533.56 And then Seth looks at
me, and he goes, man, this
11536.89 is so easy way up here.
11540.77 And I said, bro,
look at where we are.
11543.905 We are in the ravine
with the guys.
11547.43 Now, we're on a knee and
the guys are laying down,
11550.07 but it's not this--
11551.6 we weren't on some
elevated position.
11555.09 And I said, hey, it's not that
we're in an elevated position.
11558.47 It's just that we're
detached and looking around.
11560.9 And he goes, oh, my God.
11561.98 And I said, hey, you
remember when you and I went
11563.54 through this training?
11564.38 And he goes, yeah.
11565.13 And I go, this is what it
was like for me all the time.
11568.08 I was constantly
just looking around,
11570.54 so that's why it seems
like a magic power, right?
11573.41 It's like a superpower because
Seth's down there with his gun,
11577.1 and he's shooting.
11577.85 And I'm like, hey, bro, move
your guys over to that--
11580.262 go to that ridgeline right
there, set security, boom.
11582.47 And how did Jocko see that?
11585.29 Jocko must be a tactical genius.
11586.7 No, I'm not a tactical genius.
11588.33 I'm just taking a step
back and looking around.
11591.47 And like you just said,
it applies to everything
11593.57 that we do.
11594.32 If you're having a conversation
with your significant other,
11597.8 and you start to see that
they're getting frustrated
11601.19 about something,
now, look, if you're
11603.11 in the conversation 100%, you're
going to get frustrated too.
11607.135 You're going to get
frustrated, they're frustrated.
11609.26 Next thing you know you've got
an emotional argument going on,
11613.05 whereas if you take a mental
step back and say, wait,
11615.98 why are they
frustrated right now?
11618.32 Oh, because I'm trying to solve
their problem when really what
11621.78 they're looking to do is vent.
11623.03 OK, got it.
11624.05 Let them vent.
11624.8 OK, cool.
11625.46 Oh, that sounds horrible.
11627.198 What do you think
you're going to do?
11628.74 Instead of saying, well,
if that's the problem,
11629.9 here's what you should do
because people aren't always
11631.97 looking for that.
11632.73 So yeah, this
thing, this ability
11634.64 is-- and it's something that
can absolutely be trained,
11637.417 and that's what's cool about it.
11638.75 It can absolutely be trained.
11640.73 It's not a natural gift.
11642.26 It's some people we're be
better at it than others,
11645.38 but it's something
that you can train.
11647.33 And I used to see
guys develop it.
11648.93 And I see people develop it
now in the business world where
11651.56 they'll report back to me, we
had a meeting with the union
11655.49 today, and the union
started escalating
11657.86 what they wanted to do.
11659.04 And I just took--
11659.99 I detached, and we
ended up de-escalating,
11662.667 and now we got a solution.
11663.75 So this is an absolute skill
set that can be learned,
11667.28 and that's what makes
it especially nice.
11671.6 Because there's
some people-- look,
11673.22 if you're very articulate,
born very-- some people
11677.84 are born more articulate
than other people.
11680.04 Some people are
born with an ability
11683.39 to simplify things
more than others.
11685.34 And you can train.
11686.09 You can become more articulate.
11687.5 You can become-- you can
learn to simplify things more.
11691.3 And some people are going to
be naturally good at detaching,
11693.8 but everyone can
get better at it,
11696.05 and that's a beautiful thing.
11697.258 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
a beautiful thing,
11698.925 and I'm highly
incentivized to do this.
11700.573 I mean, there are
areas of my life
11701.99 that are going really well that
I also want to apply it there.
11704.96 I think that I've tended to
rely on people close to me
11708.11 as a way to access
this detachment.
11711.44 I will be very direct
in saying that I am not
11714.83 the leader of my podcast.
11716.36 There is a leader, it is not me.
11718.98 I'm part of the team,
but it is not me.
11721.68 And I often rely on his input.
11725.06 And sometimes that
input is solicited
11727.34 and sometimes it's not.
11728.93 One place for instance where
you see people getting really
11731.96 myopic is on social media.
11735.92 And I've experienced this.
11738.41 I'd love to say that
I'm always nonreactive.
11741.14 And I think in general I take
the stance that I have filters.
11745.11 So I have filters.
11747.53 I know why I'm there.
11749.015 I'm interested in being
a teacher and a giver
11750.89 and informing people about the
beauty and utility of biology.
11754.49 That's why I say, it's not a
mission statement, it's a fact.
11757.35 That's what I care about.
11758.6 Anything that doesn't
fit through that filter,
11761.085 I don't really have
any business doing.
11762.71 But occasionally, I like to
make a joke or something.
11764.918 But occasionally
something comes through.
11766.76 And I find myself
saying, wait a second.
11768.77 And you get sucked
into that tunnel.
11771.35 And sometimes it's observing
other people in tunnels.
11774.163 And when you're
not in the tunnel,
11775.58 it's so obvious
what's happening.
11777.92 You're watching, in some
cases, people just dragging
11780.123 their lives, and some cases,
sinking their entire careers.
11782.54 I mean, the former
chair of Psychiatry
11784.58 at Columbia
University in New York
11786.56 made an absolutely foolish,
truly insensitive, totally
11792.14 inappropriate tweet.
11793.85 That's my opinion.
11794.94 And I think it was the
opinion of all the people
11796.94 that fired him from his job.
11798.107 This person was at the
apex of his career.
11800.66 Lost his job for saying
something terrible.
11804.38 And in retrospect,
was said something
11806.715 like, I don't know
what I was thinking.
11808.34 And so this guy
is a psychiatrist,
11811.52 so he lives in the
study and the treatment
11814.64 of the mind, which just goes
to show that everyone I think
11817.43 is susceptible to being
pulled into these tunnels.
11820.31 And fortunately, everyone
is susceptible to learning
11823.79 to teach themselves how to
latch themselves out of it.
11826.77 So I love this idea
of a teachable skill.
11828.733 I'm certainly going
to practice it
11830.15 in one on one and
in group situations
11833.18 and in a variety of situations.
11834.98 I think that the tunnel
has a gravitational pull.
11839.217 There's like an
allure to that tunnel.
11840.8 And I always just go right
back to the neurochemistry.
11843.197 I think that there's
something about solving
11845.03 a problem inside of a tunnel
like an animal on a chase.
11848.51 But at some point, that
animal could get picked off,
11852.65 run over by a truck
because it was--
11854.15 didn't have enough
situational awareness.
11856.07 I'm definitely going to practice
this through opening the gaze
11860.3 and broadening gaze.
11861.65 And I think I also I'm due for
a couple of days off from things
11865.19 to just walk and
think about work.
11867.02 On these retreats, do
people work on work
11869.77 or are they just there
to do other things,
11871.52 and that's where
the ideas surface?
11873.135 JOCKO WILLINK: We'll do
a little bit of both.
11875.01 So we'll do some stuff
that is focused on work,
11877.64 but then we'll pull
out and do things
11879.32 that are completely unrelated
to work for that very reason.
11883.28 Whether we do
something physical,
11885.69 whether we do some
mental exercise,
11887.96 but we do things
that are completely
11889.46 unrelated to their
work and take those
11892.31 breaks in order for
them to free their mind.
11897.2 And you know what bothers
you about social media?
11899.45 This is when you say there's
some things that make you mad--
11904.85 ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean,
not me, but it could be.
11907.1 Of course, I'm human.
11909.35 Little things
prevent-- and it's not
11910.85 the things that are obvious.
11911.66 It's actually not
direct critique of me.
11913.4 It's when people exploit
misunderstandings
11916.67 to try and create a greater
misunderstanding that
11919.64 doesn't exist.
11920.407 That's what gets me because
to a scientist, that's
11922.49 like the most irritating thing.
11924.11 I don't know what the analogy
would be in the SEAL Teams,
11926.51 but it's someone
hijacking something--
11929.03 They didn't mean that but then
they distort the argument.
11932.9 The word gaslighting gets
thrown around a lot now.
11935.21 A lot of people actually
think that anytime someone
11936.92 states a boundary.
11937.85 No, I don't believe
that's gaslighting.
11939.86 Trust me, the psychiatrist, who
are all professionally trained,
11942.02 tell me that is not gaslighting.
11943.37 Gaslighting is a
very particular thing
11944.953 where you're trying to alter
someone's reality in a very
11948.14 active almost like
sociopathic way.
11951.41 So I that's a little
editorializing right there.
11953.81 What bothers me is
when people hijack--
11959.06 sometimes someone
in an argument isn't
11961.38 as sophisticated with their
language as somebody else.
11963.63 So someone will hijack
that lack of sophistication
11965.87 and try and flip
them on their back.
11967.4 That sort of thing
really gets under my skin
11969.74 because I feel that creates
an unnecessary divide.
11974.322 There are a few other things.
11975.53 But I always joke in my lab.
11977.03 And I'll say, I have
3,000 pet peeves,
11978.96 but I also have
3,000 flaws to match
11980.9 each one of those pet peeves.
11982.43 JOCKO WILLINK: So
yeah, whenever--
11985.487 This is not just social
media, but it's just
11987.32 life when somebody says
something about me or to me
11992.15 that I don't like.
11994.13 What I realized years
ago is the reason
11996.043 I don't like it
is because there's
11997.46 some truth in what
they're saying.
11998.877 And the best thing to do is
to say either to yourself
12002.71 if you're by
yourself or to them,
12004.81 is to say, yeah, you're right.
12007.99 I am a knucklehead sometimes.
12010.42 Or yeah, you're right.
12012.73 I sometimes do jump
to conclusions.
12014.59 Or yeah, you're right.
12015.94 I was completely
wrong about that.
12018.25 And that is just so
much more liberating
12023.17 and healthy than
saying, you don't
12026.448 know what you're talking about.
12027.74 Or no, I don't--
12029.03 just going into
that defensive mode
12031.19 and trying to close your mind
instead of opening your mind up
12034.04 to listen to what somebody
else has to say, and say,
12036.23 yeah, that's a good point.
12038.14 You're spot on with that one.
12040.91 Next question, next
comment, let's go.
12043.758 ANDREW HUBERMAN: One thing
I appreciate about you
12045.8 on social media is
the limited number
12048.83 of words in each
of your responses.
12050.93 It's a great thing forcing you
to be efficient and concise
12054.83 actually is a huge advantage.
12056.7 It also forces you to be
precise at least about category.
12061.46 I think there's something
to be said for that.
12063.447 JOCKO WILLINK: Well,
there's a good example.
12065.28 So I was on Twitter
the other day
12067.94 since Twitter is getting a
lot of traction right now.
12073.015 There's a lot of
mayhem going on.
12074.39 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
the other gun fight.
12075.59 JOCKO WILLINK: And
somebody asked me,
12076.88 somebody said, hey, I'm
going to boot camp soon.
12078.92 What advice do you have for me?
12080.43 And I wrote back, enjoy.
12081.81 Boom.
12082.31 And like you said, I
mean, it's Twitter.
12083.977 I'm responding to
a bunch of people.
12085.73 And then somebody else
chimed in and said,
12089.255 you might as well not
even answer, Jocko
12092.33 that's not helping
this guy at all.
12094.38 And look at your face.
12095.972 For those of you
that are watching,
12097.43 your face just got a
little bit mad, right?
12099.222 You got a little bit
defensive for me.
12100.878 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, well,
I think, that's my nature.
12103.17 I don't like seeing
other people attacked.
12105.43 I think that's just my nature.
12106.68 JOCKO WILLINK: I had
a split second off
12108.08 who the hell is this guy?
12109.22 And then I said, you
know what, he's right.
12111.17 And then I tweeted again back.
12113.66 I said, sorry, man.
12114.56 You're right.
12115.4 What I should have
said was, hey,
12118.86 read the book Leadership
Strategy and Tactics.
12121.69 It's a good book
for someone that
12123.57 is going to be in an environment
that's going to be challenging
12126.197 and where you're going to
be faced with leadership
12128.28 challenges.
12129.24 And enjoy boot camp because
if your mindset is this sucks
12135.72 and this is terrible,
it's going to be terrible,
12139.112 and it's going to suck.
12140.07 And if you go with a mindset of
hey, this is a cool experience,
12143.74 and I should enjoy
it, you're going
12145.86 to have a much better time.
12147.21 That's my full answer.
12148.29 I'm sorry I didn't give you--
and it's perfectly fine.
12151.17 That guy was right
to critique me.
12153.48 And he was right in saying that.
12155.522 And there was a bunch--
12156.48 what's funny is a bunch of
other people came to my defense
12158.43 and said, this guy--
12159.66 that's really great.
12161.43 But my point is instead of me
getting defensive and crazy
12163.89 and letting it drive me crazy,
open my mind a little bit,
12167.19 listen to what they have to say,
accept that there's got to be
12170.04 some level of truth in it.
12171.13 And there was.
12172.14 I gave a guy a very,
very terse response,
12175.71 and I could have
expanded on it more.
12177.69 And I did.
12178.44 No big deal.
12180.44 Good times.
12181.092 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.
12182.05 A few minutes ago, I
was thinking to myself,
12184.01 I wonder where your mind
is at in the few moments
12186.49 before you fall asleep.
12187.72 Are you able to make yourself
go mind blank pretty easily?
12192.86 It's something I've been
practicing more because I
12195.048 tend to, again ruminate--
12196.09 I like to drill into
problems, obviously.
12197.89 Yesterday I did a solo episode,
which when we do those,
12200.38 they are usually anywhere
from five to 20 hours of prep.
12204.01 And then the recordings, I
won't say how long they take.
12207.64 But I love going
into the tunnel.
12209.38 The tunnel is that's
where the juice is for me.
12212.29 And finding the structure.
12213.865 And I have the benefit
of an amazing producer
12215.74 who helps me sort through it.
12217.07 And I came out of this
thing, and then went home,
12220.12 couldn't eat.
12221.093 Because I was like,
I don't want dinner.
12222.76 And then I was
explaining a call I had
12224.62 with a colleague the other day.
12226.81 My partner-- my girlfriend
she was just like, OK.
12231.07 I'm going to sleep.
12231.92 And I was up and texting and
thinking and writing notes out.
12234.97 And I thought, oh,
man, I'm like Costello
12237.01 like chewing on the stick
and chewing into my paw.
12239.65 I need sleep.
12240.25 I need to go to sleep.
12241.22 So I think I have a bit of
a harder time disengaging,
12244.87 clearly.
12246.38 And this is why I never
touch cocaine or amphetamine
12249.37 because I think
that some of us have
12251.68 a love of the dopamine
circuitry that--
12254.44 I always sensed if I were to
have tried drugs like that,
12257.53 they might have been
the thing that would hit
12263.63 my neural circuits just right.
12265.22 Some people talk about
alcohol that way.
12266.51 I've read books by
alcoholics like the book
12268.302 Dry and few other--
12269.81 Rich Roll talks about
this, that he drank alcohol
12271.98 for the first time in college.
12273.23 It was like this
elixir that filled
12274.85 his body that made him feel
right for the first time.
12277.86 That is not how I feel
after a couple of drinks.
12279.86 I feel a little relaxed,
but I can do without it.
12283.07 But this drilling into
something is really that's my--
12287.6 I guess, maybe that's my--
12289.04 I don't think it's a superpower,
but I have some strength there.
12291.83 But I think it's also the thing
that can cut on the other side.
12294.455 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,
when you started off
12296.163 this conversation
early you talked
12297.74 about getting up in the
morning, and you just get up,
12300.02 and you have these--
12300.853 I was about to go down
the path of it's--
12304.22 at nighttime when I'm
trying to go to sleep
12306.29 and I have some random
thought about some thing, that
12309.74 can be a hard--
12310.88 I have a visual thing
that's going on.
12314.27 It seems like I'm
on a roller coaster,
12316.04 and I'm going in like
a new idea comes,
12318.41 and I'm just on
this awesome ride,
12321.17 and it's not going to stop.
12322.43 And I can't-- I don't
know how to stop that.
12325.02 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no.
12326.02 I mean, I think it goes with
people who are very driven
12329.85 and like to master
different crafts.
12332.44 I have a colleague, his
name is Karl Deisseroth.
12334.44 He's a bioengineer.
12335.232 He has five children,
and he's a psychiatrist.
12338.83 He's like an incredible-- one
of these people that does a ton.
12341.52 Very likely will
win the Nobel Prize.
12343.27 I mean, he's an amazing
scientists, amazing guy.
12345.27 And he does this
practice that he does,
12347.082 which is not a
meditation, which he
12348.54 sits for an hour late at
night after his kids have gone
12351.45 to sleep, and he
forces himself, forces
12354.21 himself to think in
complete sentences
12356.19 with punctuation
about some problem.
12358.92 I tried doing that for about
five minutes, and I fell off.
12362.97 But it's something that
he's cultivated in himself,
12365.2 which helps him in his career.
12366.505 I don't think-- it's certainly
not something I recommend.
12368.88 If I did that at 1:00
or 2:00 in the morning,
12371.43 I think that would
be bad for my sleep.
12373.093 Because falling asleep
actually requires
12374.76 drifting into these
kind of liminal states.
12376.84 It's one of the reasons why
I'm a big proponent of things
12379.215 like nonsleep deep rest, or
these yoga nidra practices,
12382.05 which are basically
body scans where
12383.61 you're trying to learn to
detach from the sensory world.
12387.75 And they're very effective at--
12389.393 certainly for me
they've been very
12390.81 effective at teaching
me to turn off
12392.88 thinking, which is
an interesting notion
12394.95 in its own right.
12395.8 But I like the
idea of detachment
12398.01 by stepping back and
getting perspective.
12399.99 My father is much
better at that.
12402.15 He's a very calm guy in
the world of confrontation.
12404.995 I always knew it when I was
a kid because he would blink,
12407.37 which meant like something
was going to happen
12408.84 like I was going to get it.
12410.22 And now-- but I've always
known that he can control
12414.195 his responses, his behavior.
12416.7 Others of us in the family you
know beside from New Jersey,
12419.55 we're more like
go to loggerheads.
12421.08 So I don't know.
12422.202 This raises a
question, and I think
12423.66 it's one that I and several
other people I talked to
12427.02 in anticipation of this
podcast were asking.
12429.21 I think one reason
why people are
12430.71 drawn to people who have
been in the SEAL Teams,
12434.32 and you in particular, are that
I think everybody, not just
12439.71 males but females too.
12441.76 I think everybody wants to know
like their calibration point
12447.06 on their level of toughness.
12449.64 I think people wonder.
12450.717 I think when people
talk about BUD/S and all
12452.55 that, I think a lot
of people wonder,
12454.092 would I make it through?
12455.235 I've certainly wondered it.
12456.36 I haven't spent hours on it.
12457.8 I went my path.
12458.74 I'm happy for the path I went.
12461.16 But I think people wonder,
do I have this thing
12464.19 that supposedly
BUD/S selects for?
12466.26 And if I don't, how tough
am I or not tough am I?
12469.965 I think that we all can look
at other people physically--
12474.015 and I'm not somebody
that does a lot of this.
12475.89 I know some people are
really obsessed by this like,
12478.057 oh, that person has an eight
pack with veins on their leg.
12481.23 I don't understand that.
12482.64 That's not me, but I
understand some people do that
12484.86 even to the point of pathology.
12486.94 But I think most people
wonder, how resilient am I?
12491.76 And they can look to experiences
that they've survived
12494.04 and say, oh, I made it through,
or I'm resilient or not.
12497.4 But is there a way that we can--
12500.46 certainly that we can train
it by doing hard things?
12502.89 Cold showers, this kind of thing
are small examples of those.
12506.44 But do you think it's even
an important question to ask?
12511.27 And if it is, how does
one go about thinking,
12516.31 how resilient am I?
12517.9 Should we put ourselves into
situations of discomfort just
12521.41 to test that?
12522.25 Because I will say, I
think a lot of people
12524.11 look to SEAL Teams and team guys
in particular as a calibration
12529.84 point of like, OK, they
know how to do hard things.
12532.88 They were selected
for the ability
12534.49 to carry logs, and get into
cold water over and over,
12537.13 and roll in the sand, and go
without sleep for a week or so.
12540.367 But that's probably not
what they were doing
12542.2 when they were on deployment.
12543.408 It's clearly a pressure
test for something else.
12547.45 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, it's
a strange, strange thing.
12550.09 The Basic Underwater
Demolition SEAL training.
12552.82 And quite frankly, going
and getting wet and cold
12559.08 and being miserable is
actually nothing compared
12567.79 to being on deployment.
12571.48 And a good example that
I use to compare this to
12574.69 is, when I was on deployment
in 2006 in Ramadi, there was--
12581.515 as you were driving off base
to go into the city and conduct
12588.52 operations, as you drove out
of the compound, on your right
12593.74 was this area that was
called the vehicle graveyard.
12598.87 And the vehicle graveyard was
exactly what it sounds like.
12601.97 It was probably
75 or 100 vehicles
12606.92 that were blown up,
destroyed, burned,
12612.14 in various twisted conditions
that had been dragged back
12617.51 through the city and put
into this vehicle graveyard.
12619.73 And as you drove by
that vehicle graveyard,
12622.25 you know without
question that every one
12625.01 of those twisted vehicles
represented one, two, three,
12632.91 four, five, American casualties
horribly wounded, killed.
12641.85 And there you are in a
vehicle about to roll out
12646.63 into that city where
what you're looking at
12650.98 can easily be you in
the next three minutes.
12654.34 And you're going
to do that today.
12656.325 You're going to
do that tomorrow.
12657.7 You can do that the next day and
the day after that and the day
12660.325 after that.
12662.632 That compared to--
and by the way,
12664.89 this isn't just seals
that are doing that.
12666.64 This is Marines, this is the
army guys that are over there.
12669.25 This is what everyone is doing.
12671.87 And they do it.
12674.37 They do it.
12676.95 I talk about Marc Lee
who was one of my guys.
12679.35 First CO killed in Iraq.
12680.56 And he was the lead turret
gunner in the lead Humvee.
12687.34 And in Vietnam, if you were
the point man in Vietnam,
12692.04 if you're in infantry
patrol, you're
12694.017 the point man in Vietnam,
you were at risk--
12695.85 booby traps, ambush.
12697.65 So they rotated you out.
12699.75 You didn't have to stay
up there all the time.
12701.82 You do an hour up as point man,
they get someone else up there.
12706.74 And that guy, the
lead turret gunner
12710.155 in a Humvee column of four,
or five, or six vehicles,
12714.79 if you hit an IED, that's the
vehicle that's going to hit it.
12718.51 If you go into an
ambush, that's the guy
12720.25 that's going to get hits.
12721.292 The guy that's standing up in
a 50 caliber turret, that's
12726.28 the guy that's going to die.
12728.59 And Marc-- he was
a new guy, so he's
12734.41 in that lead turret, 50 Cal.
12736.63 And he never asked
to get rotated out.
12742.59 And I remember he was a very--
12745.01 I like to say very.
12746.19 He was extremely charismatic,
funny, gregarious comedian.
12755.13 And we got all kinds
of stories about Marc.
12758.13 But one of them, we were in
Vegas, and we're all gambling.
12760.92 And I come down
from my hotel room,
12764.16 and I see Marc across the--
he's playing blackjack.
12767.85 When he sees me,
he goes, hey, sir,
12769.38 when are the new
Cadillacs coming out.
12771.33 Like he's just lighting
up everybody, just having
12774.93 a fantastic time.
12776.11 But I remember one night he's
getting ready to roll out.
12778.65 And if I wasn't going
out with the platoons,
12781.74 I would go out see the guys
off, give them a hands salute
12784.368 as they're leaving.
12785.16 And I'm like, how are
you feeling, Marc?
12786.827 How you doing, Marc?
12787.66 Are you good to go?
12788.55 And he's like,
feeling lucky, sir.
12790.92 That was his attitude.
12792.96 And he's a guy that's going
to drive by that vehicle
12795.51 graveyard, drive right
out of that city,
12797.778 and he's going to do it the next
day, and the day after that,
12800.32 and the day after that.
12801.278 So-- and like I said, that's
what the army guys are doing.
12805.977 That's what the Marine
Corps guys are doing.
12807.81 They're doing it.
12809.62 And so as much as the mythology
around basic SEAL training
12814.17 goes, to me that experience
in combat and what guys do
12823.36 is infinitely harder and
infinitely more important.
12831.16 Now, all that being
said, basic SEAL training
12834.961 is a very strange
laboratory for human beings.
12838.09 It is a very strange
laboratory for human beings.
12840.954 And it's crazy the way it works.
12850.16 It's obviously extremely
difficult, but there's no--
12853.57 I wouldn't put money.
12856.05 You could put odds
on somebody making it
12857.79 through like, hey,
that guy seems
12859.61 like he's going be good to go.
12860.86 But I wouldn't put a
bunch of money on it.
12863.07 And I wouldn't take like 100%,
I would never take 100% bet
12866.16 on anybody because
there's no one that's
12868.08 100% going to make it
through that training.
12870.06 And there's just
random-- some people say,
12873.963 well, it's because your why.
12875.13 There's people that make
it through SEAL training
12876.48 because their ex-girlfriend
said they couldn't make it.
12879.12 There's some other
guy that makes it
12880.62 through because they promised
God that they would make it.
12883.962 There's some other
guy that made it
12885.42 through because their dad
said they could never.
12887.55 There's lie every one of these
examples you can come up with.
12890.092 And it's good enough for some
random dude to make it through.
12893.34 And it doesn't matter
what your pedigree is.
12895.32 It doesn't matter
where you're from.
12896.82 There's guys from Iowa.
12898.14 There's guys from Florida.
12899.58 There's guys from
wherever that make it.
12903.22 And those guys from Iowa,
and those guys from Florida,
12905.47 and those guys from
wherever, that don't make it.
12906.94 Guys from farms.
12907.9 Guys from silver
spoon in their mouth,
12910.39 and you just can't predict it.
12912.34 And I mean, it has to have
something to do with the fact
12915.28 that how bad you
actually want to do it.
12921.02 That's-- it's a strange thing.
12923.12 And I wouldn't try and--
12926.15 if I was in the world, if
I didn't do that training,
12929.672 I wouldn't be trying to
figure out if I could make it
12931.88 or not because you don't know.
12934.57 You don't know.
12937.52 It's a very strange thing.
12939.71 And it's so mythical
almost right now.
12944.97 It's mythical that
how hard it is.
12948.66 And this is not too many
people make it through, man.
12951.55 It's--
12952.05 ANDREW HUBERMAN: 15%.
12953.033 JOCKO WILLINK: --yeah.
12953.95 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,
from all the folks
12955.658 that I've talked to there, or
gone through, been instructors
12959.28 there, some we
both know, it seem
12962.58 that that 15% number is unlikely
to change as long as they
12966.48 keep the process the same.
12968.11 It just seems
about 15% of people
12970.29 seem to have something
in them that can perhaps
12973.2 grow during that training.
12974.4 But that it is being
identified and selected for
12978.48 rather than somehow
being built up
12980.4 across at least that phase,
the early phases of training.
12983.31 And then at some point they
build on that capacity.
12986.22 And this gets to this really
somewhat controversial issue
12989.7 frankly, are people
wired differently?
12992.37 And listen, I started off
in neural development.
12996.51 And I'll tell you that there
are some universal properties
12999.06 of neural development
in all surviving humans.
13001.91 Like that you're going
to breathe without having
13004.1 to think about it.
13004.85 Your heart is going
to beat without having
13005.87 to think about it.
13006.62 But beyond that, there's a lot
of variation in natural levels
13009.47 of dopamine and serotonin.
13012.8 There's nature plays a
powerful role and nurture.
13015.943 And what's
interesting, though, is
13017.36 we can't always
predict from parents
13020.36 what nature is going to do.
13021.56 Recently we had
someone on the podcast.
13023.185 I'm excited for you to listen
to it if perhaps you will
13025.55 if I send it to you.
13026.383 There's a guy who talks about
inheritable acquired traits.
13030.5 You don't expect that
because you work out
13032.36 that your grandkids
will be more muscular
13034.34 and have better endurance.
13035.99 But there's actually
some evidence
13037.67 that that may be the case.
13039.23 And you go, well,
how could that be?
13040.85 We got two kinds of
cells in your body.
13042.48 It turns out you
have what are called
13043.28 somatic cells, which
are all of them.
13044.57 Then you have the
germ cells, which
13046.028 are your sperm and
your wife's eggs.
13048.56 Well, why wouldn't the DNA of
the sperm cells and the egg
13052.4 cells be modifiable
by experience
13054.29 if all the other cells are?
13055.49 And it turns out there's
some evidence that maybe it's
13057.74 not the DNA but the rNRA.
13059.78 Think about that.
13060.65 That means that whether-- and
we know this that people that
13062.54 have been in a famine,
several generations later,
13064.7 their implications for
blood sugar regulation
13067.35 in their great grandkids.
13068.94 So the idea that experience
and acquired traits
13072.11 can change us is actually
has some validity.
13076.42 And this gets into
really complicated things
13078.38 to people who go, oh, this
is like the giraffe that
13079.88 had to crane its neck,
and then gave birth
13081.86 to longer necked giraffes.
13083.15 And it's like, well, not exactly
but also not entirely untrue
13087.86 either.
13088.4 So I love the idea that
there are inherited traits
13091.88 and that nature and
nurture play a role,
13094.64 but that hard work may actually
transmit across generations.
13099.05 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah,
there's in SEAL training
13100.97 you have kids that come through
that they call legacies, which
13104.09 means that they have a dad--
13105.68 I think a dad,
brother, whatever.
13108.68 And they do have a better
chance of making it,
13112.67 but it's not a
guaranteed chance at all.
13115.73 And my personal
opinion is I think
13118.91 a legacy kid would have a
better chance of making it just
13122.0 due to the Thanksgiving
dinner that you're
13124.622 going to have to go through
for the rest of your life
13126.83 with your family--
13128.0 ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you don't.
13128.66 JOCKO WILLINK: --yeah,
if you're even invited,
13130.577 which you might be on your own.
13133.01 But yeah, maybe there's
something to that as well.
13136.26 But I think that's
just more the pressure
13139.66 that someone must feel
like, hey, there's
13142.27 no way I'm going to be
allowed back in my home
13145.48 if I don't make it
through this training.
13147.53 So I'm going to have to just
go ahead and suck it up.
13150.25 But not everyone makes it.
13153.01 And it's a bummer
when that does occur.
13155.355 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, for people
13156.73 who are not thinking about going
through SEAL training, or who
13159.13 miss the opportunity, or who
are not interested in that
13161.422 for whatever
reason, do you think
13163.75 there's value to
doing things each day
13166.6 that suck a little bit?
13168.43 Or from time to
time doing something
13170.41 that puts one into a state
of deliberate discomfort?
13173.497 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, 100%.
13174.58 Yeah, I mean, 100%.
13176.14 I mean, even in order
to improve yourself,
13179.14 you've got to impose some
discipline on yourself.
13182.89 If you want to get
stronger, you've
13184.54 got to do things that
require strength.
13186.855 If you want to be
tougher, you've
13188.23 got to do things that
require you to be tougher.
13190.27 I think that's pretty
straightforward.
13191.89 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Does
that mean doing things
13192.94 that are not pleasurable?
13194.06 So for instance, I've
done some long podcasts.
13197.95 And a few weeks ago, we were
doing a series with Andy Galpin
13202.493 all about exercise
and exercise science.
13204.16 And we did six podcasts in that
week, the most I've ever done,
13206.743 which made doing four or five
the next week not so bad.
13209.74 But I loved every second of it.
13211.84 And I love every
second of podcasting.
13214.09 And so it didn't suck, but it
built up a greater capacity.
13217.707 I guess, I'm asking
specifically about things that
13219.79 really feel like a splinter.
13221.74 Is there any value to that?
13223.69 Because I have to say there
are some people I know,
13226.09 some of them are former team--
13227.95 are team guys, I guess, you
don't say former team guys.
13230.928 They are out of the Teams now,
but they're team guys forever,
13233.47 who seem to not be
rattled by little things.
13236.98 Those guys in particular,
they don't seem
13238.878 to be rattled by little things.
13240.17 And then I know people that
they get the wrong size
13244.5 coffee at a coffee
shop, and they dissolve
13246.25 into a puddle of tears.
13248.26 So there does seem
to be something
13250.0 to this whole like
mental resilience thing
13251.98 and flexibility thing.
13253.9 And I try and do something
that's uncomfortable to me
13258.91 about once a week, something
I really don't like.
13264.27 It doesn't matter what
that is, but I try and do
13266.27 something that's unpleasant.
13268.738 Or do something in a
way that's unpleasant.
13270.53 I guess, the example would be
getting into the cold water
13273.108 the first thing in the morning.
13274.4 And making that decision
from under the blankets
13277.7 is a rough one for me.
13279.83 But then it gets easier.
13280.933 And then you wonder, is it
still serving the purpose
13283.1 that it's building me up?
13284.57 So should people seek
truly bad experiences
13288.35 provided that they're
done in a safe way?
13290.277 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
13291.11 Yeah.
13293.93 I think that you're
going to, just like you,
13296.75 would develop your
legs by doing squats.
13299.69 And you would develop your
back by doing pull ups.
13302.33 I think you would
develop your resiliency
13304.61 by doing repetitions of things
that require you to be tougher.
13309.8 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That actually suck.
13311.3 OK, good.
13312.16 And the reason I ask this is
because I think a lot of people
13314.66 think, well, I
work out every day.
13316.118 But then you probe them a
little bit, and they're like,
13318.41 but I love exercise.
13319.557 And then well, then
that doesn't quite
13321.14 qualify as something
that makes you tougher.
13323.45 Or they think oh, the last
reps of a set are really tough.
13326.09 But if you love hitting
failure on a set because that's
13328.94 what I seek in the gym.
13329.9 I love that aspect
of the training.
13331.82 That's actually where I
know I'm getting better.
13333.23 It no longer serves as
resilience training,
13335.12 it more just serves as training.
13337.745 In any case, I think
that the point is clear,
13339.62 and I appreciate your answer.
13341.6 I have to ask about something.
13343.91 This is going to seem
like a total divergence
13345.95 but it's not, which is animals.
13349.31 Because first of
all, they're a love
13350.81 of mine in terms of
understanding the animal
13353.27 kingdom and placing humans
into the animal kingdom.
13355.49 Second of all, I
know you're a hunter.
13358.76 And also I know you own dogs.
13361.16 And the question I have is,
do you ever look at people,
13364.58 or did you ever work
in Teams of guys
13367.61 when you were on active duty--
13370.653 see that the difference
is you mentioned
13372.32 before, this person is really
good at problem solving,
13374.57 this person's a little
bit more creative.
13377.605 Do you ever wonder
whether or not
13378.98 people embody different
animal archetypes?
13383.81 Because I do.
13384.8 JOCKO WILLINK: Well, that thing
where people say that dogs
13387.79 or owners look like their dogs,
dogs look like their owners,
13390.29 I think that's--
13391.07 I've seen all kinds of examples.
13392.642 You can go on the
internet and find
13394.1 a bunch of examples
of dogs that look
13396.2 like their owners and owners
that look like their dogs.
13398.57 So I think that's true.
13400.05 And I think my dog is awesome.
13403.803 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Tell
me about your dog.
13405.47 What kind of dog is it?
13406.28 JOCKO WILLINK: My dog
is a German Shepherd.
13408.072 His name is Odin, and
he's an awesome dog.
13413.69 And he's got a personality.
13415.25 He's got an interesting
personality.
13416.93 So like he doesn't
like to cuddle.
13426.065 My kids will be like oh,
he doesn't like to cuddle.
13428.19 No.
13428.79 Even when we go to
bed at night, he
13432.06 goes to 4 feet away
from the foot of my bed.
13435.65 Even if I was
like, hey, jump up.
13437.058 I've told him, jump up in here.
13438.35 We want to pet you.
13439.922 He'll jump up in
there, and he just
13441.38 like goes in that
low crouch position.
13444.53 And then waits until
I say, free dog,
13447.505 and then he goes back down,
and he goes 4 feet away
13449.63 from the foot of the
bed and sits there.
13451.46 Because that's
his personality is
13455.15 to protect, and set
security, and do his job.
13459.17 And that's what he's like.
13460.89 And so you've got
other dogs that are--
13466.58 they're in a totally
different mindset.
13468.95 So yeah, dogs have
definite personalities.
13471.59 And look, I also have--
13474.8 it's not all genetic.
13476.12 So two of my friends got
dogs that were brothers.
13482.595 What are they called?
13483.47 Dogo Argentinos.
13485.215 You know those?
13485.84 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, the Dogoes?
13486.35 Yeah, those are hard
to get in the US.
13488.15 They're not-- They
might not even
13490.31 be legal in the United
States, so don't tell me
13492.38 who these people are.
13493.07 Not that I care, but I'm
not going to report them.
13494.3 JOCKO WILLINK: I won't
tell you who they are.
13495.11 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.
13496.027 JOCKO WILLINK: But
these two guys--
13497.66 and those two guys had
different personalities.
13500.27 One guy is a very
happy-go-lucky,
13502.85 likes to smoke pot, likes
to hang out, very just
13507.2 a chill, playful guy.
13509.655 The other guy is not.
13510.53 He's the opposite
in every category.
13514.61 And they both got these dogs.
13516.74 And you fast
forward like a year,
13520.64 the dog that was owned
by the playful guy,
13524.18 his dog was just a
big puppy licking
13527.24 at-- just wagging the tail.
13529.58 The other dog, you had
to keep it in a cage
13532.67 or it would murder
everything in sight.
13534.81 And these dogs were brothers
from the same litter,
13537.62 and they were
completely opposite.
13539.7 And so I think it has a lot
more to do with nurture than it
13547.04 does to do with nature.
13548.06 But that being said, when
you look at Malinois I mean,
13553.55 Malinois have a personality
that is very distinct compared
13556.79 to a German Shepherd.
13557.84 Now, look there's
outlying Malinois,
13559.7 there's outlying
German Shepherds,
13561.26 there's outlying you name
whatever kind of Golden
13564.65 Retriever or whatever dog is
known for being more playful.
13569.63 You get around the Malinois,
Malinois are Malinois.
13573.8 And they're that way.
13574.73 Have you been around
Malinois before?
13575.93 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mm-hmm.
13576.62 Oh, uh--
13577.16 JOCKO WILLINK: The
Belgian Malinois?
13577.93 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, a few of them.
13579.472 My neighbor has one, and that
thing is not terribly friendly.
13583.82 But it's a security dog,
so I don't expect it to be.
13586.61 JOCKO WILLINK: Exactly.
13587.568 ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
yeah, I know they use them
13589.79 for work in the Teams.
13590.96 And I've heard that you
have to keep a close eye
13592.982 on your relationship with
them because if you get lax
13595.19 about it, they'll bite you.
13596.418 JOCKO WILLINK: That's for true.
13597.71 The first time I saw one
we were doing a drill using
13604.06 dogs for the first time.
13605.06 And then one of the Team
guide dog handlers came out.
13607.77 And so we hit this
target building,
13609.71 and they prebriefed
us like, hey, you
13612.057 hit this target
building, and this guy
13613.64 is going to be a
runner, a squirter.
13616.4 And so we pull up
in the Humvees,
13619.1 assault team jumps out,
I'm staying external,
13621.62 I want to see what's
going to happen.
13623.55 So the squirter
goes running off.
13626.03 And the dog handler--
13629.63 whatever-- tracks his dog on
this guy, and then releases it,
13635.352 gives him whatever commands--
13636.56 [GROWLS]
13637.06 --or whatever the commands are.
13638.9 That thing is totally primed.
13642.113 Unlike anything you've
ever seen in your life.
13644.03 It is just primed.
13645.02 It's tracking that guy.
13646.64 He hits that release
on that leash,
13648.65 and that thing takes off
at 1,000 miles an hour.
13652.13 It jumps like, I'm
not kidding, 15 feet,
13656.21 maybe 10 feet in the air away
and just chomps onto this dude.
13661.58 The dude goes down.
13662.54 It was freaking awesome.
13665.255 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've seen
some videos of those Malinois.
13667.88 I guess, I didn't--
13668.672 forgive me because
before I didn't
13670.088 know what you were referring
to Belgian Malinois.
13672.29 Those dogs like
running up trees,
13674.09 jumping over little rivers.
13676.9 Yeah, it's crazy.
13677.99 Incredibly powerful animals.
13679.58 Yeah.
13680.15 Well, the idea that
they mimic their owners
13682.223 has me a little concerned
because my last dog,
13684.14 I had to put him down.
13684.65 It was my bulldog Costello.
13685.775 He's a Bulldog Mastiff.
13687.53 I got him because I went to
pick out a puppy, basically.
13691.945 And there were eight
of these bulldogs.
13693.57 And all of them
were running around,
13694.73 and then there's one in the
background just eating out
13696.35 of all of their bowls.
13697.4 And I was like, I want that one.
13699.185 Big bulldog, biggest
one in the litter.
13701.03 Laziest creature.
13703.67 Not just dog but laziest
creature that ever existed.
13706.2 But if you need to
activate, he would.
13708.598 He was just very
efficient with his energy.
13710.39 And I don't think I have
a bulldog personality,
13713.0 and that's why I got
him to balance me out.
13715.55 Never retrieved,
never did anything.
13719.09 Stole and destroyed every toy,
every dog park in San Diego.
13722.51 He was famous there.
13723.95 I had to bring $5 bills to
pay people for all the balls
13727.013 and things he would destroy.
13728.18 So anyway, my apologies
to all the dog owners.
13730.52 Not really.
13731.09 I miss him.
13732.385 Did you train your dog, or
did someone else in the house?
13734.76 JOCKO WILLINK: I did.
13735.11 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And was he trained
13736.568 to be a security dog, or
family dog, or a mixture?
13739.58 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I mean,
they're true working dogs.
13743.495 Unless you have the time
and effort to put into him,
13747.11 or you buy them that way, you
don't want one of those dogs
13752.63 that I was just
describing in your house.
13754.43 They're not for a house
unless there's that level.
13758.54 My dog is not that level.
13760.4 He's awesome.
13761.69 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you apply
some of the same principles
13764.69 that you use in leadership
of humans with your dog?
13768.2 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, there are
a lot of similar principles,
13770.81 but there's some differences.
13774.89 They're pack animals, and they
respond to the pack leader.
13781.31 it's funny.
13781.94 My dog obeys me as if
it's the command of God.
13787.49 And my wife, he's like
maybe I'll do what you say.
13791.21 So they pick up on that stuff.
13793.432 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Dogs
are very intuitive.
13795.14 I love this idea that I
was told early on that they
13797.57 can feel your emotions.
13798.77 I think they actually can
sense how we feel not just
13802.25 by the intonation of our voice.
13804.14 But I hope someday someone will
figure out in a noninvasive way
13807.645 because I don't like
the idea of people
13809.27 doing experiments on
dogs in an invasive way.
13811.747 Like what they're picking up on?
13813.08 Like for instance, we know that
sharks are paying attention
13815.538 to the amount of activity
in the lateral line of fish.
13818.36 Fish have these
stretches of neurons
13820.492 that they call the lateral line
that allows them to school,
13822.95 and know the distance
to different things,
13824.27 and be able to
steer around coral.
13825.687 They feel proximity.
13826.607 It would be like if
you're turning a corner,
13828.44 you go-- vrrt.
13829.16 --and they can even recognize
specific lateral line
13832.7 signatures.
13833.36 So it'd be like you and
Marc Lee walking together
13835.22 through the dark.
13835.928 But maybe people sift around.
13837.17 But you're like, you don't have
to look at them, that's Marc.
13838.91 You learn him intuitively.
13840.47 A fish can do that.
13841.4 Sharks can sense whether or
not the lateral line is--
13846.6 let's say vibrating but firing
at a particular frequency
13849.86 to know oh, that fish
is a little bit slower
13852.65 than the rest.
13853.34 I mean, hunting
animals just they
13856.28 develop these incredible senses.
13858.02 And I think humans have
some of these senses in more
13862.67 rudimentary way.
13863.353 We're just not forced to
use them unless, of course,
13865.52 you become a hunter of
animals, or a hunter of humans,
13869.27 and you tap into these
neural circuits that
13871.31 are very primitive and
hardwired in everybody.
13873.71 But of course, they're
honed in warriors.
13877.61 Well, I could spiral off into
animal biology in ways that
13881.27 truly would take us 26 hours.
13882.96 I don't want to do that.
13885.72 I'm almost hesitant
to ask this question,
13887.46 but I'm going to do it anyway.
13891.87 Many times online, you
are asked whether or not
13895.08 you will run for office?
13897.3 And I want to say that I
think it's a true compliment.
13901.86 I don't think people are asking
just to entertain themselves.
13904.86 I think that this
country certainly
13907.56 and a lot of the world is
desperate for certain kinds
13911.18 of leaders and people
that have experience
13912.93 in high risk, high consequence,
chaotic situations,
13915.87 and have shown prowess at
leadership in multiple domains.
13919.74 And you are certainly
one of those individuals.
13923.65 And so they ask for that
reason among others.
13926.64 And I've heard you
give your answer,
13929.13 and you can repeat
it again here.
13930.72 But as a more broad theme that I
think people are interested in,
13936.93 do you think it's an
important criteria
13940.32 or it would be
great to see people
13943.02 in positions of leadership
who've had wartime experience?
13947.25 And do you think that some
of the shifts that we've
13949.5 seen in terms of
patterns of leadership
13952.56 over the last-- let's
just make it real broad
13954.75 so that this isn't related
to any particular person
13957.72 or stretch of history--
but over the last,
13959.89 let's just say 25
years, reflect the fact
13962.46 that we haven't
seen a lot of that,
13964.41 at least at the top
tiers of leadership?
13967.41 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I think
it'd be excellent if people--
13970.1 if the president had
military experience for sure.
13974.06 I think that then they
understand the way
13977.15 the military works better.
13979.04 They understand that each--
the civilians that control
13981.978 the military.
13982.52 Because a lot of times
people that are civilians
13984.68 don't understand that the
civilians control the military.
13987.92 And I think that you do get to
appreciate what war actually is
13994.5 and what the costs are.
13996.93 I think that I've seen in
the same vein of people
14002.85 asking me to run for
political office,
14005.55 I've heard, seen
comments saying, oh,
14007.89 that's what we
need, another war--
14009.57 a warmonger in office.
14011.82 And I've responded
a few of those.
14014.02 I think if there's any group
of people that don't want war,
14017.94 it's people that have seen it.
14019.62 People that understand
what the sacrifices are.
14024.66 And I think that
being in the military,
14028.86 people understand that better.
14030.28 So yeah, I think it'd be
a great qualification.
14032.46 I don't think it's mandatory.
14033.758 I mean, clearly it's not.
14034.8 We've had a bunch of
presidents that haven't ever
14037.05 served anything.
14038.065 Really, we've had a bunch of
presidents that haven't ever
14040.44 served anything but themselves.
14042.48 So yeah, hopefully, we'll
get some more people that
14046.1 have some experience
in the military,
14048.59 some combat experience
would be especially nice.
14051.77 And that would be
good in my opinion.
14055.118 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well
I'm certainly not one
14056.91 to tell people what to do,
and I'm certainly not going
14058.62 to tell you what to do.
14059.578 But should you
ever choose to run,
14061.11 I would certainly be very
enthusiastic about that.
14064.77 And I will just say
that with that stated,
14069.542 I hope people do hear
what you just said.
14071.25 I share that sentiment.
14072.93 People who have led others
besides themselves, I think
14075.96 is the key statement there.
14077.52 JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah.
14078.353 And look, I just--
14079.35 I have friends that
are politicians,
14081.3 and I really appreciate
what they're doing.
14084.25 And it looks miserable to me.
14087.3 I don't like what--
14088.83 good for them.
14089.97 I'm happy that they're in there
trying to make a difference.
14093.82 And I guess, this is me being
selfish of me saying, look,
14097.81 I don't think I
could stomach that.
14099.52 And I also think that right
now, I'm trying to help out.
14106.26 For instance, we have
obviously got the leadership
14108.42 consulting in
Echelon Front, we're
14109.56 trying to help businesses grow.
14110.94 I've got Origin
USA, we're bringing
14113.61 manufacturing back to America.
14115.05 We've got 100, 400,
450 employees right
14118.2 now that are here in
America working and growing
14121.77 that business.
14123.038 Obviously, that
supplements-- so everything
14124.83 that I'm doing here right
now is to try and move
14131.03 the needle with America.
14133.76 Bringing manufacturing back,
helping the economy as much
14136.34 as I can right now.
14137.45 So that's what I'm
doing right now.
14139.82 And my standard answer,
which you alluded to,
14143.24 is if things got
bad enough, then
14147.7 I would do what I had to do.
14150.75 But I don't think people
appreciate my level of bad.
14154.55 I'm talking real bad.
14156.77 So it's not there yet.
14158.3 And hopefully, it
never will get there.
14160.14 I'd rather surf and
hang out with my friends
14163.28 and hang out with my
family than do that.
14166.79 And hopefully, America can
find some level of balance.
14172.85 I think that's the problem
that we're having right now.
14175.19 And a lot of these things
that you talked about,
14177.573 specifically the thing
you talked about,
14179.24 social media is not very
good for political balance.
14182.51 It's actually horrible
for political balance,
14185.75 and a lot of it has to
do with just the way
14187.885 that those
conversations are had.
14189.26 A lot of it has to do with ego
as well because I don't ever
14193.34 want to admit that I'm
wrong about anything.
14196.55 And if I can find
something that I
14198.71 think you might be
wrong about, it's
14200.63 so satisfying to my ego to
just call you out on that thing
14204.2 and attack you.
14204.88 And I think that's what a lot
of people are doing right now.
14207.38 Now, that being said, I also
usually say this as well.
14211.172 I travel around the
country all the time.
14212.88 I work with companies
of all sizes, work
14215.193 with people in every
different industry.
14216.86 And they're not sitting
around arguing with each other
14220.64 about the political scenery.
14223.495 They're talking about, hey,
how can we grow our business?
14225.87 How can we take
care of our workers?
14226.91 How can we take
care of our clients?
14227.99 How can we take care
of our customer?
14229.532 That's what people
are focused on.
14231.05 And when you jump
on social media,
14233.42 you can get sucked into the
political scene very easily.
14238.31 And that being said,
also we do have
14241.49 to pay attention
because we as citizens
14245.81 have to make sure
that America stays
14250.07 on the correct path within
the guardrails of what
14255.41 this country is based on.
14256.92 So we do have to pay attention.
14260.43 But I will be doing
my part as a civilian
14263.57 until there's total mayhem
and chaos in the streets.
14266.69 Then I'll probably just
be a benevolent dictator
14269.03 that takes over.
14269.84 [LAUGHS]
14270.417 ANDREW HUBERMAN: Should be
an interesting one, but, hey,
14272.75 you would be the man to
lead under any conditions.
14275.06 But thank you for
stating your threshold.
14277.183 Certainly, you've
earned the right
14278.6 to make whatever decision is
that you feel is right for you.
14281.13 And I want to say that I agree.
14283.2 I feel like we are a
country that still includes
14285.2 a ton of generators
and a ton of projectors
14287.65 that are interested
in projecting the good
14289.4 and growing the good.
14290.6 I do believe both those
phenotypes are important.
14295.345 I also want to
just say thank you
14296.72 for being a generator of
so much useful knowledge.
14300.38 In science, we have a saying,
which is somebody is an n of 1.
14305.12 This is a rare thing
to hear about oneself
14308.15 or to hear about somebody
because what it means
14310.31 is that somebody is in a
category in which pretty
14312.8 much everything that
they do and they say
14314.6 matters and serves
a purpose, which
14317.33 is a useful and important
building purpose.
14320.04 And I will look at you and tell
you that you are an n of 1.
14324.26 You certainly would meet that
criteria under any conditions.
14327.68 And it's evident in
the many companies
14330.17 that you're running and the
leadership that you're doing.
14332.6 And also in your
online presence.
14334.1 I mean, that's how I initially
came to learn about you.
14336.77 I'm now fortunate to have two
lengthy conversations with you
14340.97 and a few interspersed as well.
14342.98 And I think of myself as
a reasonable perhaps good
14346.37 observer of how people
behave in different domains.
14348.74 And every time you post,
or every time you speak,
14352.43 or every time you go on a
podcast or host a podcast,
14355.89 it's clear that not
only are you prepared
14358.46 and not only are you approaching
it with a spirit of seriousness
14363.25 that it deserves
but sometimes also
14364.91 lightness that it deserves.
14366.14 But there's always
an element of give
14368.468 and that you're trying to
encourage people to do better
14370.76 for themselves.
14371.49 So as somebody who's greatly
benefited from the knowledge
14374.06 that you've put out there from
the very first Tim Ferriss
14376.435 and Joe Rogan episodes
to your own podcast,
14378.68 I want to extend
a personal thanks.
14380.87 I also want to
extend great thanks
14382.85 for coming on here
today, talking
14384.41 to a geek scientist
who also happens
14386.75 to be a fellow punk rocker.
14387.95 Because that spirit and
the heart that's behind it,
14391.19 I think some people think it's
all about noise and chaos,
14393.95 it's actually about being
really true to yourself.
14396.053 That's how I think about
the punk rock spirit.
14397.97 It's really about
being true to yourself
14399.11 and realizing that the
thing that you like,
14400.91 while it might be
quite different,
14402.56 is actually, if that's you,
you have to live in that vein
14406.16 and stick with it.
14406.97 It certainly served
me well, and it
14408.2 sounds like it served you well.
14409.492 But mostly I just want to
extend an enormous thank you.
14413.498 As a civilian, thank
you for the work
14415.04 you did in the military
but also teaching people
14417.26 about the military.
14418.088 I think a lot of
people don't realize
14419.63 what it's about at any level.
14421.43 And learning about
your experience
14423.2 there, and what you've
observed, bringing
14425.09 other people's experiences
from the military more broadly
14428.03 is super important.
14429.137 And sharing this and
being able to entertain
14430.97 some of my scientific riffs.
14432.71 So thank you, thank
you, thank you.
14437.62 JOCKO WILLINK: Well,
I appreciate it.
14440.71 it's weird you say all
these nice things to me.
14442.947 I definitely don't deserve them.
14444.28 I'm a regular dude
that just showed up,
14447.67 I guess, at the right
time and told some stories
14450.97 about some guys that
were true heroes,
14453.28 and just trying to
share my perspective.
14457.96 But it's not just
my perspective,
14460.06 I'm talking about
stories that I lived.
14463.12 But there's plenty
of people that
14464.505 have done way more
than I've ever
14465.88 done and sacrificed infinitely
more than I ever sacrificed.
14470.41 So I'm thankful for being here.
14474.74 I know that you put all kinds
of information and the same back
14478.93 at you.
14479.5 I have greatly benefited
from the information
14482.5 that you put out.
14483.47 And so I thank you as well.
14485.93 And I appreciate coming
on here and appreciate
14488.41 you spreading the word about how
people can be better yourself.
14491.99 So thanks for having me.
14493.34 I appreciate it, man.
14494.44 ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I appreciate you,
14495.25 and I appreciate this time,
and let's do it again.
14497.59 JOCKO WILLINK: Check.

14558.07 On various episodes of
the Huberman Lab podcast,
14560.2 we discuss supplements.
14561.55 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
14563.77 many people derive tremendous
benefit from them for things
14566.38 like enhancing sleep,
focus, hormone support,
14569.333 and many other features of
mental health, physical health,
14571.75 and performance.
14572.8 The Huberman Lab podcast
is proud to be partnered
14574.87 with Momentous supplements.
14576.46 Momentous supplements are
of the very highest quality,
14579.07 and they focus on single
ingredient formulations, which
14581.92 is very important if you are
going to develop the most
14584.17 cost effective and
biologically effective
14586.69 supplement regimen for you.
14588.62 In addition, they
ship internationally,
14590.515 which is important
because I know many of you
14592.39 reside outside of
the United States.
14593.92 If you'd like to see the
supplements discussed on this
14596.17 podcast, you can go to
livemomentous.com/huberman.
14600.1 And there you can
also get 20% off any
14602.47 of Momentous supplements.
14604.39 If you're not already
following us on social media,
14606.59 we are Huberman Lab on
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook,
14609.14 and LinkedIn.
14610.0 And in particular
on Instagram, I
14612.55 cover science and science
related tools, some of which
14615.04 overlap with the contents
of the Huberman Lab podcast.
14617.53 Much of which is
distinct however
14619.423 from the contents of the
Huberman Lab podcast.
14621.34 Again, its Huberman Lab on
all social media platforms.
