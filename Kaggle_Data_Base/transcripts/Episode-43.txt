0.35 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2.3 where we discuss science
and science based tools
4.93 for everyday life.
6.533 [cheerful music]
9.16 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.1 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.01 at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.02 Today, we are discussing aggression.
17.47 I'm going to explain to you that there are
18.95 several different types of
aggression, for instance,
21.37 reactive aggression versus
proactive aggression.
23.75 Meaning sometimes people
will be aggressive
26.47 because they feel threatened
or they are protecting
29.32 those that they love,
who also feel threatened.
32.49 There's also proactive
aggression where people
34.36 go out of their way to
deliberately try and harm others.
37.97 And there is indirect
aggression, which is aggression,
41.08 not involving physical
violence, for instance,
43.98 shaming people and things of that sort.
46.79 It turns out that there are
different biological mechanisms
49.27 underlying each of the
different types of aggression.
51.9 And today I will define those for you.
54.01 I'll talk about the neural
circuits in the brain and body
55.91 that mediate each of the
different kinds of aggression.
58.73 Talk about some of the
hormones and peptides
60.79 and neurotransmitters involved.
62.54 I promise to make it
all accessible to you,
64.58 even if you do not have any
biology or science background,
68.0 I will also discuss
tools, psychological tools
71.13 and biological tools that one can use to
74.65 better control aggression.
76.41 Now, right here at the outset,
77.48 I want to acknowledge that any
discussion about aggression
80.68 has to have an element
of context within it.
84.5 To be fair, human beings
invest a lot of money,
88.15 a lot of time, and a lot of energy,
90.42 and indeed can even derive
pleasure from aggression.
93.92 Later I'll talk about neural
circuits in the brain and body
96.9 that reinforce, in other words,
reward through the release
100.48 of chemicals that make people feel good.
103.27 Acts of aggression.
105.04 However, what I'm mainly referring to
107.12 is the context in which
human beings will pay money
110.35 in order to derive what we
call vicarious aggression,
115.09 put it simply people spend
an enormous amount of money
118.43 and time and energy watching
other people engage in,
121.3 for instance, aggressive sports.
122.92 And we know that observing
your team winning
125.5 over another team causes the
release of neurochemicals
128.48 in your brain and body
that make you feel good.
130.25 And yes, that can make
you feel more aggressive.
133.632 We also know of course that
most governments invest
137.622 many billions if not trillions of dollars
140.68 in infrastructure,
technologies and human beings
143.81 in order to engage in
aggression if needed,
146.37 so-called military warfare, et cetera.
149.23 So today's discussion will
include a description of
152.22 aggression in the pathological sense.
154.35 We'll actually talk about an
explosive aggressive disorder
158.27 that most of you probably
haven't heard of,
159.86 but is actually far more
common than perhaps, you know,
163.32 we'll talk about the role of
things like attention deficit,
166.08 hyperactivity disorder,
167.26 and how that can relate
to aggression through
170.16 the relationship between
impulsivity and aggression.
172.72 And we'll talk about verbal aggression,
174.39 physical aggression, proactive aggression,
176.85 as mentioned before,
and reactive aggression.
179.55 I'm certain that by
the end of the episode,
180.99 you will come away with a much
more thorough understanding
183.8 of what this thing that we
call aggression really is.
186.74 And when you see it in other people,
188.628 I think it will make more sense to you.
190.8 And when you observe it in
yourself or the impulse to engage
194.53 in aggression, verbal,
or physical or otherwise,
197.67 I hope that you'll
understand it better as well.
199.7 And of course, the tools
that I will describe
201.744 should allow you to modulate and control
205.24 aggressive tendencies or
predispositions to aggressiveness
208.25 and just generally to be
able to engage with people
211.95 in a more adaptive way overall.
214.09 Before we begin, I'd like to
emphasize that this podcast
216.75 is separate from my teaching
and research roles at Stanford.
219.61 It is however, part of
my desire and effort
222.04 to bring zero cost to consumer
information about science
224.64 and science related tools
to the general public.
227.47 In keeping with that theme,
228.52 I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's podcast.
231.56 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
233.96 Athletic Greens is an
all-in-one vitamin mineral
236.43 probiotic drink that's designed to meet
238.6 all your foundational health needs.
240.94 I started taking Athletic
Greens way back in 2012.
244.3 So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring this podcast.
247.06 The reason I started
taking Athletic Greens
248.81 and the reason I still
take Athletic Greens
250.41 once or twice a day is that
it covers all of my basic
253.16 vitamin mineral and probiotic needs.
255.97 The probiotics are
especially important to me.
257.86 There are now abundant data
showing that the gut microbiome,
262.11 which is basically a
community of trillions
265.1 of little bacteria that live
in our guts are beneficial
268.95 for our immune system, for brain function,
271.58 for mood and many other
aspects of our health.
274.97 The gut microbiome thrives on
probiotics and Athletic Greens
278.33 contains the proper array of probiotics
280.62 to optimize the gut microbiome.
282.75 Athletic Greens also has
adaptogens for recovery
285.07 from physical and mental exertion,
287.0 digestive enzymes for gut
health, vitamin C, zinc,
290.39 as I mentioned before, all the
other vitamins and minerals
292.8 that you need in order to cover
your basic needs each day.
296.33 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
297.68 you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
300.42 and claim a special offer.
302.15 That'll give you five free
travel packs that make it easy
304.3 to mix up Athletic Greens
while you're on the road
306.0 and a year supply of Vitamin D3K2.
308.01 There's now a wealth of
data showing that vitamin D3
311.84 is important for many
aspects of our immediate
314.29 and long term health.
315.99 Many people, even if they
get out in the sunlight
317.99 are not getting enough Vitamin D3,
320.44 and the K2 is thought to be beneficial
322.54 for calcium regulation and
a number of other things
325.36 important to our health.
326.48 So again, if you go to
athleticGreens.com/huberman,
329.24 you can claim the
special offer of the five
330.76 free travel packs and the
year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
334.55 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
337.27 ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
339.04 that are the absolute highest quality.
341.14 The company was founded by
two All-American swimmers
343.24 from Stanford and everything
about their eyeglasses
345.71 and sunglasses were designed
with performance in mind,
349.11 I've spent a lifetime
working on the biology
351.24 of the visual system, I can
tell you that your visual system
353.78 has to contend with some
pretty tough challenges
356.24 as you move throughout the day.
357.28 For instance, if you go
from a brightly lit region
359.64 to a dimmer region, your
visual system has to adjust.
362.83 ROKA eyeglasses and
sunglasses were designed
364.57 with those sorts of adjustments in mind.
366.47 So for instance, if you're
outside in the shade,
368.37 you move into the sun and
then back into the shade,
370.13 you don't have to take
your sunglasses on and off.
372.323 Their glasses were initially designed
374.37 for sports performance
and the great thing is
376.98 they could be used for
that, but also they have
378.62 a terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them
380.88 to work or out to dinner.
381.93 I wear readers at night
and when I drive at night
385.11 and I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot
387.53 on really bright days.
389.58 The terrific thing about
ROKA glasses is that even
391.77 if you get sweaty, they won't fall off.
393.25 So you can run with them,
you can cycle with them.
395.63 Or as I mentioned before, you can just
397.2 wear them out and about.
398.5 If you'd like to try ROKA,
you can go to roka.com,
400.95 that's R-O-K-A.com and
enter the code "Huberman"
403.87 to save 20% off your first order.
406.13 Again, that's ROKA roka.com
408.27 and enter the code "Huberman" at checkout.
410.6 Today's episode is also
brought to us by Helix Sleep.
413.48 Helix Sleep makes mattresses
and pillows that in my opinion
416.42 are the very best you'll find.
418.34 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
420.185 a little over a year ago,
421.787 and it's the best sleep
I've had ever since.
424.562 If you go to the Helix site,
they have a terrific sleep quiz
428.37 that just takes a few minutes,
ask you questions like,
430.897 "Do you tend to sleep on your side,
432.81 your back or your stomach?"
434.07 Maybe you don't know
because you're asleep,
435.98 but many people do know.
437.3 And even if you don't know that's okay,
438.8 it will also ask you questions like,
440.067 "Do you tend to run hot or cold?"
441.74 Do you tend to wake up in the
middle of the night or not?
443.86 And by taking that brief
quiz, they will match you
445.74 to the specific mattress
that's ideal for you
448.63 and your sleep needs.
449.84 And that's really what sets
Helix Sleep mattresses apart.
453.157 Everybody's unique, and they know that.
455.34 So if you take this
quiz, you'll get matched
457.03 to a particular mattress.
457.863 For me, it was the
"Dusk" mattress D-U-S-K,
460.02 but again, that's just me,
and you may match to that one,
462.69 or you may match to a different one.
464.696 If you're interested in
upgrading your mattress
466.57 and sleeping much better, go
to helixsleep.com/huberman.
470.07 Take that two minute sleep
quiz and they'll match you
471.85 to a customized mattress and
you'll get up to $200 off
475.15 any mattress order and two free pillows.
477.24 I also love their pillows.
478.193 I've always had this issue with pillows
479.77 that they heat up too much.
481.08 I'm always looking for the
pillow that can cool itself.
483.55 Somehow the pillows stay nice and cool.
485.62 They're also not too big,
so I'm not propped up,
487.752 not getting the Text Neck
in the middle of the night,
490.27 where I'm letting my chin push my chest,
491.52 nor am I falling back and
having trouble breathing
494.45 in the middle of the night.
495.283 They're designed just right.
496.21 They also have a 10 years warranty
497.86 and you get to try it out for
a hundred nights, risk free.
500.57 They'll even pick it up for
you if you don't love it.
502.13 But I think that you will.
503.36 Again, if you're interested, you can go
504.57 to helixsleep.com/huberman
for up to $200 off
508.58 and two free pillows.
510.08 Let's talk about aggression.
511.82 I think that many people
out there are put off
514.68 by aggression, although
others are drawn to aggression
518.02 both in themselves and when
observing it in others.
521.768 The reason to talk about aggression is,
524.03 that as mentioned before,
525.399 the context of aggression really matters.
528.17 So there are instances where
aggression is adaptive.
531.78 For instance, a mother
protecting her children
535.35 if she's being attacked,
536.45 or if her children are being threatened.
537.6 I think most people would
agree that so-called
539.93 maternal aggression of that sort,
542.21 provided the context is
right, is a great thing.
545.68 Protecting our young is
after all one of the primary
548.7 adaptive drives of our species,
and thank goodness it is.
551.95 Of course, other forms of aggression
553.89 like unprovoked, proactive aggression,
556.92 somebody simply being
violent to somebody else,
559.272 even when unprovoked, most of us cringe
562.17 when we see that kind of behavior,
563.75 it can even evoke aggression in people
566.14 when they observe that kind of behavior.
568.74 So again, context really matters,
571.18 but a more general and perhaps
an even more important reason
574.93 to think about and understand aggression
577.485 is that by understanding the biology
579.62 and psychology of aggression, you will be
582.49 in a much better position to understand
584.48 how all emotional states come to be,
586.85 both in yourself and in others.
589.14 For instance, many of you have
probably heard the statement
592.84 that I believe arises from pop psychology,
595.44 not from formal academic psychology,
597.84 that aggression is just sadness.
601.24 It's a form of sadness that's amplified
603.26 and it shows up as aggression.
605.06 But when we look at the underlying biology
607.51 and the peer reviewed literature on this,
609.484 nothing could be further from the truth.
611.64 We have distinct circuits
in the brain for aggression
615.36 versus grief and mourning,
those are non-overlapping.
619.32 Now that doesn't mean that you
can't be sad and aggressive
622.01 or in a state of mourning and
aggressive at the same time,
625.01 but the idea that sadness and aggression
626.77 are one in the same
thing is simply not true.
630.37 And by understanding that,
or perhaps by understanding
633.81 that irritability and aggression
are not the same thing,
637.11 you'll be in a much
better position to apply
639.12 some of the tools that we will
talk about in this episode
641.29 in order to be able to
reduce or eliminate,
644.97 or if it's adaptive to you
to modulate aggression.
647.89 And yes, there are cases where
modulating your aggression
650.73 in some cases, even amplifying
aggression can be adaptive.
654.5 Now this of course is
not the first discussion
656.76 about the biology of aggression
658.76 or the psychology of aggression.
660.067 And we really can look to the
beginning of the last century
663.11 as the time in which the formal study
666.201 of aggression really began.
668.75 One of the names that's most
associated with the formal
671.5 study of aggression is none
other than Konrad Lorenz.
675.73 Some of you may be
familiar with that name,
677.59 others of you may not be
familiar with that name.
680.347 Konrad Lorenz studied
so-called imprinting behaviors
685.46 and fixed action pattern behaviors.
687.98 He's most famous, at least
in scientific circles,
690.338 for getting geese to believe
that he was their parent.
694.4 And if you were to put into
Google Conrad with a K, Lorenz,
697.58 just as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese,
700.16 you're going to see a
lot of photos of Conrad
701.91 walking down roads with a
lot of geese following him
704.26 or swimming in lakes with a
lot of geese following him.
706.588 He had a habit of geese adopting him
709.87 because of the behaviors
that he partook in.
711.78 So he would swim out on a lake
713.26 in front of a bunch of
little geese and then
714.55 they would think that he was the parent
716.0 and they would imprint on him.
716.93 He even lived with these
animals and they lived with him,
719.42 sort of a strange
character from what I hear.
721.66 But nonetheless, all
this work was deserving
724.11 of a Nobel prize because
what he discovered
726.51 were fixed action patterns.
728.126 That is patterns of behavior
731.17 that could be evoked by a single stimulus.
734.02 Okay. This is really important.
735.541 The idea that you can get a
whole category of behaviors,
739.2 like swimming behind a parent,
742.62 or looking to somebody for
comfort, and only them,
746.68 the idea that you could
get a huge category
748.69 of different behaviors in a
bunch of different contexts
751.05 triggered by just the presence
of that person is remarkable,
754.63 because what it suggested
and what turns out to be true
757.22 is that there are neural circuits,
759.44 not just individual brain
areas, but collections
761.47 of brain areas that work together
763.1 to engage a pattern of behaviors.
765.6 And that's the first fundamental principle
768.61 that we need to define today,
770.31 that when we talk about aggression,
772.64 we are talking about
activation of neural circuits,
775.55 not individual brain
areas, but neural circuits
778.16 that get played out in
sequence like keys on a piano,
782.01 but that playing out in sequence means
783.78 that aggression is a verb.
785.93 It has a beginning, a middle
and an end, and it's a process.
789.33 It's not an event.
790.96 And as you'll see, that turns
out to be very important
793.14 in terms of thinking about
how one can halt aggression,
796.95 prevent it from happening
before it's initiated,
801.11 or maybe even prolonging aggression,
803.52 if that's what's needed.
804.76 Now, Konrad Lorenz had no real
knowledge of neural circuits.
808.05 I mean, obviously he
knew there was this thing
809.92 that we call a brain and a nervous system,
812.3 and he knew that there
were chemicals in the brain
814.99 and hormones and things of that sort
816.75 that were likely to play a role,
818.29 but he really didn't take
any measures to define
821.17 what the neural circuits were,
frankly, he didn't need to.
823.71 He had his Nobel prize and he
did all this beautiful work.
826.63 He's known for an abundance of work,
828.85 but he did think about what
sorts of underlying processes
833.29 could drive something like aggression.
835.76 And he talked about one particular feature
838.64 that's especially important,
840.11 and that's this notion of a pressure.
842.59 The idea that yes, certain
hormones will bias somebody
848.81 or an animal to be aggressive,
850.43 certain neural transmitter
states, and you'll learn
852.42 what those are today will bias somebody
855.02 to be more or less aggressive,
856.77 maybe even submissive and passive,
858.68 maybe outright proactively
aggressive towards anyone
862.11 or anything in front of them.
863.71 And yes, of course there
will be historical features
866.69 based on their childhood,
et cetera, et cetera.
868.939 He understood that there will
be a constellation of things
871.58 that would drive people to be aggressive.
874.216 And he described a so-called pressure,
876.3 almost like a hydraulic pressure.
877.77 Just think about fluid
pressure in a small container
880.37 being pushed, pushed,
pushed until the can,
882.3 or the container is ready to explode
884.49 and how multiple features,
multiple variables
888.13 could impinge on that
and create that pressure.
891.28 It turns out that's exactly
the way the system works.
894.01 There is no single brain area
895.57 that flips the switch for aggression.
897.84 Although we'll soon talk
about a brain structure
899.66 that generally houses the propensity
902.94 and the output of aggression.
905.75 This notion of a hydraulic
pressure that can drive us
908.76 toward aggressive behavior
or conversely can be
913.12 very low pressure and keep us
in a state of non-reactivity,
916.68 maybe even passivity or submissiveness
919.7 is a very important feature
because it really captures
922.41 the essence of how neural circuits work
924.94 when we're talking about
primitive behaviors generally.
927.4 And you can start to notice
this in yourself and in others,
931.35 you can start to notice
when you are veering
933.7 toward aggression or
when someone is veering
936.36 toward aggression, verbal or physical.
939.13 Now that veering is the buildup
of this hydraulic pressure
944.03 that Lorenz was referring to,
945.46 and it really does have an
underlying biological basis.
949.33 Now it was some years later
that the first experiments
953.34 came along, which really
started to identify
956.82 the brain areas and the
biological so-called pressures
960.64 that can induce aggressive behavior.
963.37 And the person that really
gets credit for this
965.17 is a guy by the name of Walter Hess,
968.15 who at that time was working on cats.
970.84 And I know that when say working on cats,
973.0 a lot of people will cringe.
973.89 A lot of people have cats as pets,
975.28 and certainly cats can be delightful.
977.43 Some people like them more,
some people like them less.
979.55 Most people cringe at the idea
of doing experiments on cats.
983.28 I should say that these days,
984.69 very few laboratories work on cats.
986.52 Most laboratories that
work on animal models
988.75 will work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies
991.28 for their capacity to do genetics,
993.44 on laboratory mice, sometimes
rats, but usually mice.
996.902 And occasionally you'll find a
lab that still works on cats.
1001.43 Back in the time of Hess,
very few laboratories
1004.43 worked on mice, most laboratories
worked on cats or rats.
1008.35 And the reason for that is
nowadays most laboratories
1011.25 use mice if they use animal models
1013.25 because of the genetic
tools that exist in mice
1015.61 to knock out this gene or
knock in this gene, et cetera,
1018.52 which can't be done in
humans or non-human primates,
1021.14 at least not very easily
at this point in history.
1024.71 So when I say he was working on cats,
1026.41 I realized that probably
evokes some negative emotions
1028.6 in some of you, maybe even
aggression in some of you,
1031.132 what we can do, however,
is look at the data
1034.94 and make use of the data in
terms of our understanding.
1038.95 What Hess did was he
had cats that were awake
1042.92 and he was able to lower
a stimulating electrode
1045.16 into their brain.
1045.993 Now keep in mind that the brain
1046.826 does not have any pain sensors.
1048.56 So after a small hole
is made in the skull,
1050.9 electrodes are lowered into the brain.
1052.33 This is what's done commonly
in human neurosurgery.
1055.42 And he was able to stimulate
different brain areas
1058.48 and he was sort of poking around.
1060.19 And when I say sort of,
he was doing this with
1061.9 some logical intent and purpose,
1064.73 he wasn't just poking
around in there for fun.
1066.21 He was trying to identify brain
regions that could generate
1071.241 entire categories of
behavior, ALA Lorenz, right?
1075.34 These fixed action pattern behaviors.
1078.67 Eventually his electrode landed in a site
1080.933 and he provided electrical
stimulation to the cat
1084.01 that caused this otherwise
passive purring relaxing cat
1090.45 to suddenly go into an absolute rage.
1093.15 So arched back, hissing hair up.
1096.34 So called piloerection,
where the hairs go up,
1099.37 animals try to make
themselves as big as possible
1101.39 often when they're aggressive.
1104.49 Drooling, maybe even
spitting, believe it or not,
1107.24 cats and other animals can do this.
1109.12 And the cat tried to
attack him or anyone else,
1112.06 and anything else, even inanimate objects
1116.3 when he stimulated this
particula brain area.
1118.9 So Hess obviously took notice
1121.16 of this incredible
transformation in behavior.
1124.14 And the fact that when he
turned off the stimulation
1127.31 of this particular brain area,
1128.82 the cat very quickly within seconds,
1131.01 went back to being passive calm kitty.
1134.14 Now, of course, he repeated
this experiment in other animals
1137.62 because he had to confirm that
it wasn't just happenstance,
1140.83 that there wasn't something
unique about this one cat
1144.36 that perhaps he had stimulated an area
1147.53 that had been built up during
the kittenhood of this cat
1152.35 and had been reactivated.
1153.59 Maybe this kitten had been
traumatized early in life
1155.82 or scared and reactivation
of a particular circuit,
1158.85 unique to that cat created
this aggressive behavior.
1162.637 That wasn't the case,
every cat that he looked at
1166.64 and stimulated this particular brain area,
1168.84 the cat would immediately
go into an aggressive,
1171.3 almost rage type behavior.
1172.6 Now, of course we can't anthropomorphize.
1174.36 We don't know what the cat was feeling.
1175.77 For all we know the cat could be happy,
1177.13 although that seems pretty unlikely
1179.98 and later experiments done in mice,
1182.73 but also in humans confirm that indeed,
1185.034 stimulation of this brain area evoked
1187.98 not just behavioral aggression,
1189.84 but also subjective feelings
of aggression and anger.
1193.4 So what was this incredible brain area,
1196.058 or rather, I should say,
what is the brain area
1198.82 that harbored this incredible capacity
1201.58 to generate aggressive
behavior in Hess's experiments?
1206.51 Well, for those of you
that are regular listeners
1208.62 of this podcast, you'll
probably be relieved to know
1211.63 that today we're going to talk
about some new neural circuits,
1214.35 oftentimes we'll center
back on the amygdala
1217.58 or the prefrontal cortex,
and those names will come up.
1219.837 And for those of you that
haven't heard them before,
1221.88 don't worry, I'll make it clear as to what
1223.54 those brain areas are and what they do.
1226.04 But today we're going to talk a lot about
1228.3 the so-called VMH or
ventromedial hypothalamus.
1233.03 The ventromedial
hypothalamus is a nucleus,
1236.38 meaning a small collection of neurons...
1238.81 What are neurons?
1239.94 Nerve cells, and that
small collection of neurons
1243.55 that we call the ventromedial
hypothalamus is truly small.
1246.46 It's only about 1,500 neurons
on one side of your brain
1250.99 and a matching 1,500 neurons
on the other side of your brain
1254.44 and that combined 3000 neurons
or so, it's not exactly 3000,
1258.94 but 3000 neurons or so
is sufficient to generate
1264.0 aggressive behavior of the sort
1266.735 that Hess observed in the
cat, and believe it or not,
1271.7 when you see somebody
who's in an act of rage
1274.59 or in an act of verbal aggression
1277.11 or in an act of defensive aggression,
1279.28 protecting their family or loved
ones or country, et cetera,
1283.285 almost certainly those neurons
are engaged in that behavior.
1288.35 Those neurons are perhaps
even generating that behavior.
1292.69 And next I'll describe some
experiments that were done
1295.15 just recently within
the last 10 years or so,
1297.79 but leading right up until this year
1299.31 and even last month that keep confirming
1302.15 again and again and again,
1304.0 that it is the activity of neurons
1305.63 in the ventromedial hypothalamus
that are both necessary
1308.26 and sufficient to
generate the full catalog
1312.03 of aggressive behaviors.
1313.82 Now, before I go further to describe
1316.44 the beautiful recent studies on the VMH,
1319.64 the ventromedial hypothalamus,
1321.08 and the important role of testosterone,
1323.13 and more importantly, estrogen,
1325.52 in the activation of aggressive
behavior, that's right.
1327.68 That's soon to be clear to
you why that's the case.
1331.391 I want to emphasize that the
ventromedial hypothalamus
1335.1 is something that we
should all care about.
1336.6 Why?
1337.86 Well, it turns out that many categories
1341.41 of psychiatric disorders,
developmental disorders,
1344.91 and psychological challenges,
things like schizophrenia,
1348.17 PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression,
1351.72 borderline personality disorder,
1353.91 and even certain forms of
autism can include elements
1357.35 of aggression and even violence.
1359.05 Now it's certainly not the case
that aggression and violence
1362.15 are present in all people
who suffer from schizophrenia
1366.21 or PTSD or depression or autism
1368.11 or borderline personality disorder.
1369.934 I'm absolutely not saying that.
1373.27 However, it can be a feature of those.
1376.09 And it's a well described feature
1378.77 in terms of trying to
understand the constellation
1381.329 of challenges that people suffer
from when they have those.
1384.18 So thinking about the VMH goes
way beyond just understanding
1386.415 basic aggression in the
context of adaptive aggression.
1390.16 So, you know, when
earlier I use the example,
1393.2 maternal aggression, that's one
adaptive form of aggression.
1397.168 It also can be pathologic aggression,
1400.04 meaning it can harm ourselves or others.
1402.52 So keep this in mind as we go forward,
1404.09 because later we're going
to talk about specific tools
1406.317 designed to modulate or prevent
aggression in, for instance,
1411.27 people with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder,
1413.76 and especially kids with ADHD.
1417.63 In the meantime, let's return to the VMH,
1420.13 this relatively small
collection of neurons.
1422.027 And the reason I say
relatively small is, well,
1424.09 your brain has many hundreds
of billions of neurons,
1427.25 maybe even trillions of neurons,
1428.69 the exact number of
neurons isn't really clear,
1430.67 but it's a lot.
1432.07 And it certainly is a lot
relative to the number of neurons
1436.13 this 3000 or so neurons
living in your hypothalamus
1439.71 that can evoke this aggressive response.
1444.25 Experiments done by David
Anderson's lab at Caltech
1447.98 were really the first to
parse the fine circuitry
1451.01 and to really show that the
ventromedial hypothalamus
1454.01 is both necessary and sufficient
for aggressive behavior.
1457.32 These are important experiments
1458.45 and they're worth knowing about.
1459.912 What they did was they
identified, first of all,
1464.97 where the ventromedial
hypothalamus was in the mouse,
1467.16 that was pretty straightforward
to do was sort of known
1468.99 before they started these experiments.
1470.83 And then they analyzed which
genes, meaning which DNA,
1476.5 which of course becomes RNA
and RNA becomes protein,
1480.52 which DNA and therefore
which proteins are expressed
1484.24 in particular cells of the
ventromedial hypothalamus.
1487.9 And it turns out that
there's a particular category
1490.59 of neurons in the
ventromedial hypothalamus
1494.07 that make an estrogen receptor.
1496.977 And it is those neurons in
particular that are responsible
1501.01 for generating aggressive behavior.
1504.12 How did they know this?
1505.06 Well, they used a tool that's
actually been described
1507.57 by a previous guest of this podcast.
1509.2 We had an episode with the
psychiatrist and bioengineer
1511.76 and my colleague at
Stanford School of Medicine,
1513.67 Karl Deisseroth, he and
others have developed tools
1518.06 that allow people to control
the activity of neurons
1521.66 essentially by remote control,
1522.91 by shining light on those neurons.
1524.6 So in the context of an
experiment on a mouse,
1526.89 which is what David's
lab did, and these were
1528.67 the beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin
1530.21 who's now in her own laboratory
at New York University,
1533.93 put a little fiber optic
cable down into the brain
1536.2 into the hypothalamus
that is of the mouse.
1539.26 The mouse is able to move around
in its cage freely moving,
1543.53 even though it has a little
tether, this little wire,
1545.44 it's a very thin wire.
1546.63 And that little thin wire is actually
1548.16 a little what we call optrode.
1549.47 And the experimentalist
in this case, Dayu,
1551.86 was able to stimulate the turning on
1555.67 of a little bit of blue
light and that blue light
1558.607 activated only those
estrogen receptor neurons
1563.38 in only the ventromedial hypothalamus
1565.892 and the way she was able to do that,
1567.177 is she had introduced a
gene that had been developed
1570.54 by our friend, Karl
Deisseroth that allows light
1575.24 to trigger electrical
activity in those neurons.
1577.89 So if any of that is confusing,
1579.23 or if all of that is confusing,
here's the experiment.
1581.16 There's a mouse in a cage.
1583.17 It has a little wire
coming out of its head.
1584.65 It doesn't notice, believe it or not.
1586.56 We know this 'cause it's
still eating and mating
1588.39 and doing all the things
that mics like to do
1590.8 on a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.
1592.819 And the mere pressing of
a button will activate
1596.25 a little bit of light released
at the end of that wire,
1598.73 that light activates particular
neurons in this case,
1601.61 it's the estrogen receptor
containing neurons
1603.97 in only the ventromedial hypothalamus.
1607.73 When that mouse is in a
cage with another mouse,
1610.32 a couple of things happen depending on
1612.54 what the other mouse is, or we could say
1614.73 who the other mouse is.
1616.24 If it's a male mouse and you put in there
1618.75 with a female mouse, the male
mouse will attempt to mate
1622.47 with a female mouse
provided that the male mouse
1624.45 has gone through puberty.
1625.34 He will try to mount and
mate with the female mouse.
1627.93 Now female mice are either
in a receptive phase
1631.26 or a non-receptive phase of
their so-called estrous cycle.
1633.77 They don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle
1635.59 They have an estrous cycle.
1637.53 And on particular days
of the estrous cycle,
1639.496 they are not happy to mate.
1642.44 They will basically
keep their hindquarters
1645.46 away from the male mouse at all costs.
1647.57 They'll even attack the male mouse.
1650.91 On certain days of the
estrous cycle, however,
1652.64 the female mouse will undergo
what's called lordosis,
1654.8 which is an arching of her
back and she'll allow the male
1657.84 to mount and mate with her.
1659.82 So a large number of
experiments were done,
1662.6 but the first experiment really
was to put the male mouse
1666.32 in with a female mouse
who's in the so-called
1668.12 receptive phase of estrus.
1670.34 That is, she will allow mating
and he starts mating with her
1674.35 and they go through
the standard repertoire
1676.75 of mating behaviors that
you observe in mice:
1679.533 mounting, thrusting,
intromission as it's called
1683.27 in the mouse sex world.
1685.31 Well, I guess I don't know
what the mice call it,
1686.61 but that's what the experimenters call it.
1688.39 And then afterwards that
he will dismount, okay.
1692.0 So they observe this kind
of mounting and sex behavior
1695.36 is very typical, but about
halfway through the behavior,
1700.14 Dayu turned on the light to stimulate
1703.6 these estrogen receptor containing neurons
1705.9 only in the male mouse
and what she observed
1708.05 was incredibly dramatic.
1710.16 The male mouse ceases from trying to mate
1712.4 with the female mouse
and immediately tries
1714.04 to kill the female mouse.
1715.51 He starts attacking her.
1718.22 Then she turns off the
light, the male stops
1721.16 and goes back to trying to
mate with the female mouse.
1723.22 So I'm sure all of this was very confusing
1725.28 and disturbing to the female mouse.
1726.88 Nonetheless, that was the repertoire.
1729.37 They would mate.
1730.51 She would stimulate these
ventromedial hypothalamus neurons.
1733.46 The male mouse would
immediately try and attack
1735.71 and kill the female mouse.
1737.458 And then she would stop the stimulation
1739.71 and he would stop trying
to attack and kill
1741.36 the female mouse, return
to the attempt, at least,
1744.91 to mate with the female mouse.
1747.72 These are such dramatic shifts in behavior
1750.09 triggered only by the
activation of only the small set
1753.12 of neurons within the
ventromedial hypothalamus.
1755.65 And for those of you that think
1757.29 that you can watch this sort of thing
1758.93 without being disturbed, I
encourage you to go to YouTube.
1762.929 We will provide a link
where you can see a video
1766.26 of this type of behavior.
1767.23 It's incredibly dramatic.
1769.02 The shift in behavior
is almost instantaneous,
1772.35 occurs within seconds,
if not milliseconds,
1775.09 thousandths of a second.
1776.816 The next experiment that she
did was to put a male mouse
1780.579 with this stimulation
with light capability
1784.81 in its ventromedial
hypothalamus into a cage alone,
1787.77 but with a rubber glove
filled with air or water.
1790.38 Mouse, walking around sniffing, peeing,
1792.78 which is what male mice seem to do.
1794.04 They seem to urinate
everywhere, that's actually
1796.0 an interesting, perhaps
interesting feature of male mice
1798.67 and actually many male
animals, perhaps even humans.
1801.85 We don't know, or maybe we do know,
1803.85 basically this has been an
observed time and time again
1806.61 in experiments, mainly
by Lisa Stowers's lab
1809.41 at the Scripps Institute,
that's characterized this.
1811.56 If you put female mice
into an arena or a cage,
1814.29 they always urinate in a very
small corner of that cage.
1817.93 Whereas if you put mail mice
into an arena or a cage,
1821.21 the urinate everywhere,
they have this obsession
1823.6 with spraying their urine everywhere,
1825.43 you can transpose that to
human behavior if you like.
1830.39 In any event, Dayu put the
mouse in the cage alone,
1834.75 but with this rubber glove,
1836.33 the mouse is walking around
urinating, et cetera,
1838.75 doing whatever is that mice do,
1840.24 then she stimulates the activation
1842.5 of these ventromedial
hypothalamus neurons,
1844.96 and the mouse immediately
tries to kill the glove.
1848.42 It goes into a rage, attacking the glove
1850.46 as if it were another mouse
or some other animate object.
1855.08 But of course it's an inanimate object.
1856.83 It's just a rubber glove.
1858.38 She stops the stimulation and the mouse
1859.88 immediately goes back
to being completely calm
1862.04 or at least not attacking.
1863.87 Again, we don't know what
the mouse was feeling.
1866.392 So these are very dramatic videos.
1868.51 Again, you can see them
by following the link
1870.13 that we'll provide in the caption.
1871.91 If that sort of thing
is going to disturb you,
1873.76 by to see, for instance, the attack,
1876.08 one mouse attacking another,
1877.41 please just don't watch them.
1878.79 I'm not interested in traumatizing anybody
1881.62 or you traumatizing yourself, that is.
1883.381 A number of different variations
1886.05 were done on this experiment.
1887.12 For instance, stimulating
the VMH in female mice,
1892.7 as opposed to male mice,
1893.8 putting the female mice
in with other female mice
1896.72 or with other male mice,
no matter what variation
1900.89 one carries out, so it doesn't matter
1902.66 if it's male with female, male with male,
1904.47 female with female, et cetera,
1906.691 stimulation of the
ventromedial hypothalamus
1910.09 in a male mouse or a female
mouse evokes this very dramatic,
1913.61 almost instantaneous aggressive behavior,
1916.21 physically aggressive behavior.
1918.88 Subsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin
1921.14 in her own laboratory
and other laboratories
1923.58 have shown that the ventromedial
hypothalamus connected
1926.48 with a bunch of other brain
areas that are interesting,
1928.56 And I'll talk about some
of those in a little bit,
1930.55 but one of them that
I want to call out now
1933.99 is the so-called PAG, the
periaqueductal gray nucleus.
1937.27 This is a large structure
in the back of the brain
1940.25 that houses things like neurons
that can create opioids.
1943.84 We all know of the opioid
crisis, but these are neurons
1946.87 that can produce endogenous,
means made by the body,
1951.06 chemicals that can cause pain relief.
1953.77 You could understand why that might occur
1955.84 in a circuit for aggression, right?
1957.3 Even if one is the aggressor, it's likely
1960.516 that they may incur some physical damage
1962.85 and they'd want some pain relief.
1965.72 The PAG also is connected to a number
1968.17 of neural circuits that eventually,
1970.65 through several processing
stations, excuse me,
1974.29 arrive at things like the jaws.
1976.26 And in fact, stimulation of
the ventromedial hypothalamus
1978.67 can evoke biting and
aggressive biting behavior.
1981.86 Now aggressive biting behavior
is particularly interesting
1985.27 because in humans and
especially in human children,
1988.49 biting is something that,
while young children might do
1992.33 as a form of aggression,
tends to disappear
1994.66 pretty early in childhood.
1997.08 And if it doesn't, it's often
seen as a mark of pathology.
2001.55 I have a story about this,
actually, when I was a kid,
2003.52 I went to a summer sports camp
and I'll never forget this,
2008.96 so we're playing soccer and
in a rare stroke of luck
2013.3 or accident, I happened to score a goal.
2015.13 I wasn't a particularly
good soccer player,
2016.62 especially not at that stage of my life.
2017.96 They later figured out
that it was just better
2019.77 to make me a fullback, 'cause
I could just wait there
2022.07 and do what fullbacks do.
2023.47 I was better at taking
the ball or the person out
2025.76 than I was putting the ball in the goal.
2029.105 Nonetheless, I, again,
by chance, scored a goal
2033.37 and I was trotting back
to my side of the field,
2035.93 and all of a sudden I felt
this sting in my back,
2039.65 a kid, not to be named, although
I do remember your name,
2043.31 I'm not going to tell
you what his name was.
2045.21 A kid jumped on my back and
bit me on the top of my back.
2049.46 And this of course resulted
in a discussion and a timeout
2053.89 and all the usual things and
parents I think got involved.
2056.57 I don't recall, I didn't
think much else of it,
2059.21 but I recall that this was
considered especially troubling
2062.85 behavior because he bit
me as opposed to hit me
2065.99 or shoved me down or something that sort,
2067.96 and it does seem as if
the tendency to use biting
2071.55 as an aggressive behavior is associated
2074.55 with a more primitive circuitry.
2075.96 Now here I'm truly anthropomorphizing.
2077.83 I don't know what this other
kid happened to be thinking
2079.75 or feeling at the time, how could I?
2081.63 And I certainly am not going to say
2083.73 that biting in every case
reflects a pathology,
2088.1 although I think there
is general agreement
2090.41 in the psychology community,
2091.64 in the psychiatric community
that past a certain age,
2094.29 the using of one's teeth to
impart aggression and damage
2097.69 on others is a particularly
primitive and troubling
2101.7 or at least for the observer
or the person experiencing
2104.11 is a pretty disturbing event.
2106.332 Dayu's lab has shown that activation
2109.03 of the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers
2110.58 a downstream circuit in
the periaqueductal gray
2113.28 which then triggers a whole
other set of circuits of fixed
2116.34 action patterns.
2117.173 Here we are back to Lorenz
with fixed action patterns,
2120.8 including swinging of the
limbs, right punching.
2124.33 And this wouldn't necessarily
be controlled punching,
2126.73 but also biting behavior.
2129.457 So it's remarkable to me,
2130.29 at least that we have circuits
in our brain that can evoke
2133.27 violent use of things like
our mouth or violent use of
2137.31 things like our limbs.
2138.68 That of course could be used
for things like singing or
2141.58 kissing or eating or, you know,
2144.92 gesticulating in any kind
of polite or impolite way.
2149.04 The point here is that neural circuits,
2151.49 not individual brain areas
evoke the constellation
2154.23 of behaviors that we call aggression.
2156.45 Now, many of you are probably
puzzled or at least should be
2159.238 because I've been talking about
2161.28 this highly specialized brain area,
2162.84 the ventromedial hypothalamus
and this highly specialized
2165.89 subcategory of neurons in the
ventromedial hypothalamus,
2169.28 these neurons that make
estrogen receptors.
2171.95 And yet the activation of those cells
2174.88 triggers dramatic and
immediate aggression,
2177.61 both in males and in females and both
2179.99 against males and against females.
2183.69 So what's going on here?
2184.64 Most of us think about
estrogen and we don't
2188.08 immediately think of aggression.
2189.54 Most of us hear testosterone and we might
2191.73 think about aggression,
although other things as well.
2195.01 In order to understand this, I
just want to briefly refer back
2198.7 to a conversation that I had
2200.12 on a previous episode of
the Huberman Lab Podcast.
2202.27 And that was with my colleague,
the great Robert Sapolsky
2205.95 of course, is a professor at Stanford
2207.32 who studied testosterone
and its impacts on behavior
2210.39 as well as estrogen and other hormones
2211.9 and their impacts on behavior.
2214.29 To make a long story short and to dispel
2218.3 a still unfortunately very common myth.
2220.96 Testosterone does not
increase aggressiveness,
2224.964 testosterone increases
proactivity and the willingness
2229.01 to lean into effort in
competitive scenarios.
2233.44 Sometimes this is referred to
as the challenge hypothesis,
2235.88 but to make a long story short,
2240.189 if people are given testosterone,
2242.53 or if you look at people
who have different levels,
2246.61 excuse me, of testosterone,
2248.07 endogenously that they naturally make.
2250.1 What you'll find is that
testosterone tends to increase
2253.8 competitiveness, but not
just in aggressive scenarios.
2257.37 So if somebody is already aggressive,
2260.38 giving them testosterone
will have the tendency
2263.76 to make them more aggressive.
2266.37 If somebody however is very
benevolent and altruistic,
2269.46 giving them testosterone will
make them more benevolent
2271.65 and altruistic, at least up to a point.
2273.72 Now, of course there are certain forms
2275.28 of synthetic testosterones that
are known in sports circles
2282.19 and in other circles to
increase aggressiveness
2284.75 because of the way those particular forms
2286.38 of synthetic testosterones work.
2288.12 But in general, most of the experiments
2289.6 that I'm referring to have
not been done using those,
2291.18 they've been done using
the let's call them
2293.74 the more traditional biological
forms of testosterone
2297.32 or that resemble the biological
forms of testosterone.
2299.77 In fact, Robert Sapolsky described
2301.753 a really interesting experiment in which,
2304.17 if you look at testosterone
levels or you administer
2307.48 additional testosterone to people
2309.21 who are doing philanthropy,
giving money to organizations
2313.55 and so they're essentially doing good
2314.99 because these are
organizations doing good.
2317.24 What you find is that
increased testosterone
2320.23 or further increasing
testosterone makes people
2322.8 more willing to compete,
to give more money
2324.5 than the other person
in the room in order,
2325.981 you know, to put it in air quotes,
2328.097 "To Alpha out the other
person," by giving more money.
2331.03 So this is an act of altruistic
or benevolent philanthropy.
2334.73 It is not an act of aggression.
2336.225 Of course, we don't know what the people
2338.08 are feeling underneath all that.
2339.77 Again, we can't
anthropomorphize or project
2342.58 onto other people what they're feeling.
2344.12 But the point is that testosterone itself
2346.427 does not make people more aggressive.
2350.18 And in the experiments that
we've been talking about
2351.98 up until now, it's actually the activation
2354.5 of estrogen receptor containing neurons
2357.1 that makes these animals more aggressive.
2359.27 And it turns out there's
evidence that in certain context,
2362.64 estrogen can make people more aggressive.
2364.61 So what's going on here?
2366.69 Well, what's going on is that
testosterone can be converted
2371.38 into estrogen through a
process called aromatization.
2374.71 There's an enzyme called aromatase.
2376.68 Anytime you have word that ends in A-S-E,
2379.73 at least if it's in
the context of biology,
2381.44 it's almost always not always,
but almost always an enzyme.
2385.38 So the aromatase enzyme converts
testosterone into estrogen,
2390.54 and it is actually
testosterone, aromatized,
2394.37 converted into estrogen and then binding
2397.66 to these estrogen containing neurons
2400.34 in the ventromedial hypothalamus
that triggers aggression.
2404.5 I want to repeat that, it
is not testosterone itself,
2406.98 that triggers aggression.
2408.39 It is testosterone aromatized
into estrogen within the brain
2412.18 and binding to these estrogen
receptor containing neurons
2415.46 in the ventromedial hypothalamus
that evokes aggression
2418.82 and dramatic aggression at that.
2421.15 Now this effect of estrogen
causing aggression in the brain
2424.7 is very robust, so much so
that if you take a mouse
2428.92 that lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human
2431.62 that lacks the aromatase
enzyme, and they do exist,
2435.85 then there is a reduction
in overall aggression,
2439.93 despite high levels of testosterone.
2442.99 And if people who or mice who
have the aromatase enzyme have
2448.56 that enzyme blocked, well,
then it doesn't matter
2451.69 how much you increase testosterone
2453.52 or any of its other derivatives.
2455.48 You do not observe this aggression.
2458.7 So this runs counter to
everything that we know and think
2461.43 about the role of testosterone.
2463.32 Again, testosterone
increases competitiveness.
2466.4 It can increase the desire
to work under challenge.
2469.83 I've said it before, and I ran this
2472.67 or pressure tested this
against Robert Sapolsky
2475.51 who's been working on
testosterone and it's role
2477.38 in the brain and behavior
for many decades now.
2480.045 It is fair to say that
testosterone has the net effect
2485.07 of making effort feel good,
or at least increasing
2488.64 the threshold at which effort
feels bad or unsustainable.
2492.89 And it does that by way
of changing the activity
2496.52 or the threshold for
activation of brain structures,
2499.01 like the amygdala and
other brain structures
2500.8 associated with anxiety.
2502.83 So the next time somebody says,
2504.52 testosterone makes people aggressive.
2506.16 You can say, "Ah, no,
actually it's estrogen
2508.9 that makes people aggressive,
and animals aggressive
2512.44 for that matter.
2513.573 Now of course it is the
case that because males
2517.74 have relatively less estrogen circulating
2520.96 in their brain and body
than females, right?
2523.26 Because they have testes, not ovaries,
2525.415 that testosterone is
required in the first place
2529.48 in order to be converted into estrogen,
2531.36 to activate this aggressive
circuit involving
2534.24 these estrogen receptor containing neurons
2536.18 in the ventromedial hypothalamus.
2537.91 But nonetheless, it is estrogen
that is the final step.
2543.12 It is the hormone on
which aggression hinges.
2547.47 And I think for most people,
2548.75 that's a quite surprising finding.
2550.66 And yet this is perhaps one
of the more robust findings
2553.38 in both the animal and human
literature, as it relates
2557.07 to hormones and psychological
states and behavior.
2560.6 Now, of course it is the case
that if testosterone is low,
2564.63 that a person or an animal will exhibit
2567.81 less aggressive behavior, but that's not
2570.68 because of reduced testosterone per se.
2572.44 It's because of the subsequent
reduction in testosterone,
2575.477 meaning if there's no
testosterone to aromatize
2578.11 into estrogen, estrogen
will also be lower.
2580.43 So we've established that
it's not testosterone,
2583.38 but testosterone converted into estrogen
2585.97 that activates these
circuits for aggression.
2588.7 But nonetheless, it's
still surprising, right?
2592.11 I mean, most of us don't
think about estrogen
2594.6 as the hormone that stimulates aggression,
2597.51 but it turns out it's all contextual.
2600.48 There are beautiful data
showing that whether or not
2603.78 estrogen stimulates aggression,
can be powerfully modulated
2608.66 by whether or not days are
short or days are long.
2611.81 In other words, whether or not
2613.384 here's a lot of sunshine or not.
2615.32 Now, obviously brain is encased in skull.
2619.85 So it doesn't really know
if there's a lot of sunshine
2622.39 out there even though you can
see the sun with your eyes,
2624.21 you can feel it on your skin.
2625.879 Day length is converted
into hormonal signals
2629.93 and chemical signals
and the primary hormonal
2631.94 and chemical signals involve
melatonin and dopamine
2636.65 and also the stress hormones.
2637.78 So to make a very long story short,
2639.74 in the long days where
we get a lot of sunlight,
2641.89 both in our eyes and on our skin,
2644.36 melatonin levels are reduced.
2646.04 Melatonin is a hormone
that tends to produce
2648.24 states of sleepiness and quiescence.
2650.61 It also tends to activate
pathways that tend to reduce
2653.538 things like breeding and sexual behavior.
2656.61 In long days, dopamine is increased.
2659.14 Dopamine is a molecule associated
with feelings of wellbeing
2662.54 and motivation and the desire to seek out
2665.79 all sorts of things, all
sorts of motivated behaviors.
2669.23 And in long days provided
we're getting enough sunlight
2673.11 on our skin and to our
eyes, the stress hormones,
2676.97 especially cortisol, and some of the other
2679.07 stress hormones are reduced in levels.
2682.47 If estrogen levels are
increased experimentally
2685.81 under long day conditions,
it does not evoke aggression.
2690.02 However, in short days,
if estrogen is increased,
2693.33 there's a heightened
predisposition for aggression.
2697.15 And that makes perfect sense.
2699.44 If you think about what short days do
2701.41 to the biology of your brain and body.
2703.53 In short days, the
melatonin signal goes up.
2706.35 There's more melatonin circulating
2707.78 for more of each 24 hour cycle.
2710.82 Stress hormones are circulating more.
2713.49 Why? Short days tend to
be associated with winter.
2716.28 In winter, we are bombarded
with more bacterial viruses
2719.54 because bacterial viruses actually survive
2723.32 better in cold than they do in heat.
2725.64 In fact, in my laboratory, we work with
2727.03 a lot of viruses and
bacteria and when we want
2728.8 to keep them alive, we
put them in the freezer.
2730.64 If we want to kill them, if
we want to inoculate them,
2732.63 we put them under UV light.
2734.14 Like you would see from the sunlight.
2735.77 So shorter days are
conducive to aggression.
2738.73 Not because days are short per se,
2741.66 but because stress
hormone levels are higher
2743.81 and because dopamine levels are lower.
2747.57 Now, here's where all of
this starts to converge
2748.94 on a very clear biological picture,
2751.37 a very clear psychological
picture, and indeed
2753.9 a very clear set of tools that
we can think about and use.
2759.4 Under conditions where cortisol is high,
2761.41 where this stress hormone is
elevated and under conditions
2765.41 where the neuromodulator
serotonin is reduced
2770.01 there is a greater propensity for estrogen
2772.77 to trigger aggression.
2774.9 Now, again, I know I've said it before,
2777.53 but for males who make
a lot of testosterone
2780.7 relative to estrogen, you
have to swap in your mind
2783.91 this idea that if testosterone is high,
2786.41 that means that estrogen is low because
2788.82 while that can be true in
the periphery in the body,
2791.41 if testosterone is high,
there is going to be
2794.05 some aromatization, that conversion of
2796.23 testosterone to estrogen.
2797.29 So anytime you hear that
testosterone is high,
2799.56 you should think testosterone
is high in the body
2802.21 and perhaps estrogen is low in the body.
2803.79 But that means that there's
going to be heightened levels
2806.47 of estrogen in the brain and therefore
2808.64 increased propensity for aggression.
2811.102 In females who generally
make less testosterone
2814.58 relative to estrogen, there
is sufficient estrogen
2819.07 already present to trigger aggression.
2821.261 So both males and females
are primed for aggression,
2826.34 but that's riding on a
context and that context
2830.43 of whether or not you get a
tendency for aggression or not.
2833.91 depends on whether or not
cortisol is high or low,
2836.36 and I'm telling you that if
cortisol is relatively higher
2839.8 in any individual, there's
going to be a tilt,
2842.86 an increase in that hydraulic
pressure that Lorenz talked
2846.42 about toward aggression.
2849.43 And if serotonin, the
neuromodulator that is associated
2854.3 with feelings of wellbeing and sometimes
2856.56 even of slight passivity,
but certainly of wellbeing,
2859.836 if serotonin is low, there's
also going to be a further shift
2863.66 towards an aggressive tendency.
2866.33 So if we return to Lorenz's
hydraulic pressure model
2870.12 of aggression in other internal states,
2872.56 we realize that external
stimuli, things that we hear,
2876.76 things that we see, for instance,
2878.37 someone saying something upsetting or us,
2880.34 seeing somebody do something
that we don't like to others
2884.87 or to us, as well as our internal state,
2888.95 our subjective feelings of wellbeing,
2891.07 but also our stress level,
2892.44 our feelings of whether or
not we have enough resources
2895.017 and are content with what we have.
2897.16 All of that is converging on this thing
2898.9 that we call internal state and creating
2900.68 this pressure of either to be
2901.92 more aggressive or less aggressive.
2903.71 And now we have some major players feeding
2906.56 into that final pathway.
2909.13 That question of whether or not
2910.4 will we hit the other,
person, will we say the thing
2912.91 that is considered aggressive?
2914.844 Will we not say it?
2916.67 If somebody says something
or does something
2919.27 aggressive to us, will
we respond or will we be
2921.36 submissive or even passive?
2923.55 Again, there are many things
funneling into that question
2926.67 and dictating whether
or not the answer is,
2928.127 "Absolutely I'll fight back,"
2929.57 or, "I'm going to attack
them even unprovoked."
2931.95 Or if they say this, I'm going to do that,
2933.441 or no matter what they do,
I'm not going to respond.
2937.15 These kinds of things are very complex.
2939.07 And yet we really can boil them down
2941.01 to just a few common elements.
2942.61 And I'm telling you that those
elements are whether or not
2945.23 cortisol levels are relatively
lower or relatively higher.
2949.47 Again, relatively higher is going to tend
2951.32 to make people more reactive.
2952.75 Why?
2953.71 Because reactivity is really a function
2957.14 of the autonomic nervous system,
2958.97 which is sort of like a
seesaw that oscillates
2961.09 between the so-called sympathetic arm
2964.13 of the autonomic nervous system,
2965.19 which tends to put us
into a state of readiness
2967.2 through the release of adrenaline.
2968.72 Cortisol and adrenaline
when they're circulating
2970.71 the brain and body, make
us more likely to move
2973.18 and to react and to speak.
2974.8 It's actually what will induce
a kind of low level tremor,
2977.33 which is an anticipatory tremor to be able
2979.23 to move more quickly, right?
2980.87 A body in motion is more
easily set into further motion,
2984.05 that is, and the neuromodulator serotonin
2988.536 is a neuromodulator that
in general is associated
2992.74 with feelings of wellbeing in response
2995.41 to what we already have.
2996.44 So when we are well fed,
2998.3 serotonin tends to be released
in our brain and body,
3000.53 in particular, well
fed with carbohydrates,
3002.6 the precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.
3006.38 And indeed there are nice studies
3008.42 exploring the types of
diets, nutritional programs
3012.43 that can reduce aggressive
behavior, both in children
3016.05 and in adults and tryptophan-rich diets
3018.9 or supplementation with tryptophan.
3020.8 So for tryptophan rich diets,
3022.76 things like white turkey meat,
3024.28 but then there are also
a number of carbohydrates
3025.94 you can look up.
3026.87 It's very easy to find foods
3028.93 that contain lots of tryptophan.
3030.43 Those foods contain the
precursor to serotonin.
3034.96 Now it isn't simply the
case that eating more foods
3037.17 with tryptophan will tend
to reduce your aggression.
3040.01 I suppose it could do that,
if you ate it in abundance,
3042.81 it could make you tired
and then you're less likely
3044.61 to be aggressive, I don't
recommend that strategy,
3047.75 but the idea here is that
when it's been explored,
3051.73 increasing levels of tryptophan
either by supplementation
3054.57 or by food or drugs, prescription drugs
3057.79 that increase serotonin.
3059.15 So for instance, fluoxetine
sometimes called Prozac
3061.282 or Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs
3063.92 tend to reduce aggressive behavior.
3065.79 Now, not always, but in
general, that's the case.
3068.95 Similarly, because elevated cortisol tends
3071.59 to shift the whole
system, again, create more
3074.05 of a hydraulic pressure
towards aggressive states.
3076.59 If cortisol levels are
reduced, well then the tendency
3079.97 for aggressive behavior is reduced.
3081.85 This is supported by a number
of peer reviewed studies.
3084.11 We'll provide links to some of those
3085.41 in the caption show notes.
3086.72 And we're going to return to
these a bit later in the context
3089.48 of specific studies that have
looked at genetic variants
3093.329 in different individuals that cause them
3096.08 to make more or less serotonin,
3098.15 or at least to metabolize
serotonin differently.
3100.66 This is also the case for so-called
3102.75 intermittent explosive disorder
that can often be associated
3106.73 with gene variants that control
how much serotonin is made
3112.41 or how it's metabolized or
how much cortisol is made
3114.6 and how much it's metabolized.
3116.49 In thinking about tools
that are a number of things
3118.29 that one could consider.
3119.2 First of all, there are a
number of decent studies
3123.05 exploring how supplementation
with the Omega-3 fatty acids,
3126.65 which are precursors of some
of the transmitter systems,
3131.135 including serotonin that can
modulate not directly mediate,
3136.01 but modulate mood and emotional
tone supplementation with
3139.547 the omega 3 S has been shown
to reduce impulsivity and
3142.67 aggressiveness in certain
contexts in things like ADHD
3146.58 or in individuals who
have a predisposition
3149.21 for aggressive type behavior
or aggressive thinking.
3152.42 Now that doesn't necessarily
mean that the omega 3
3154.98 fatty acids are going directly
3157.21 to the ventromedial hypothalamus
and changing the activity
3159.66 of neurons there more likely they are
3161.98 causing or modulating
an overall shift in mood
3166.09 through the immune system,
through hormone systems that are
3170.21 changing the overall tone or
the propensity for neurons
3173.66 in the ventromedial
hypothalamus to be activated.
3176.92 How much omega 3 fatty acid, what source?
3179.06 Well, we've talked about
this on the podcast before.
3181.082 You can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids
3183.34 from a number of different foods.
3184.48 Getting them from whole foods
is probably the best way
3186.94 to do it, but many people,
including people with depression
3190.1 will often supplement
with one gram or more
3192.65 of omega 3 fatty acid per day.
3194.58 Some people including myself
will take them every day
3197.639 as just a general mood enhancer.
3200.11 I don't suffer from depression,
3201.27 but I've found it be
beneficial for my health.
3204.46 And so some people do that,
and I've talked about before,
3206.78 how in double blind
placebo controlled studies,
3208.9 people taking one to three
grams of omega 3 fatty acids
3211.81 per day, typically in the form
of a high quality fish oil,
3214.08 although there are other sources as well,
3215.83 algae and so forth, can
experience improvements in mood
3220.5 that are on par with some of the SSRIs,
3223.06 the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors.
3224.98 And of course, if you're
prescribed an SSRI
3226.78 by your psychiatrist or other
doctor, please do take that
3229.22 and don't cease to take it
just simply to take omega 3s.
3232.33 However you might mention to
them, and you can find links
3235.84 to the studies in our previous
episodes on depression
3238.45 that supplementation
with omega 3 fatty acids
3241.81 of at this one gram or
more of EPA specifically,
3245.12 so getting above that one gram threshold,
3246.85 as high as three grams per day
of the EPA has allowed people
3251.66 to take lower doses of SSRIs
and still keep their mood
3256.06 in a place that's beneficial for them.
3258.2 And in terms of keeping cortisol
in a range that's healthy
3261.44 and doesn't bias someone toward
high levels of aggression
3264.94 and irritability, that's
again, going to be set
3268.81 by a number of larger
modulators or contextual cues.
3272.19 And I've talked about some
of those on the podcast,
3273.81 but I'll just briefly recap them now,
3275.98 obviously getting sunlight in
your eyes early in the day,
3279.03 and as much sunlight as
you safely can in your eyes
3282.12 throughout the day is
going to be important.
3284.16 Again, because of this effect
of estrogen in long days,
3288.49 not increasing aggression,
however, in shorter days,
3292.01 estrogen increases aggression
because of the increase
3295.14 in cortisol observed in short days.
3297.82 Another way to reduce cortisol
was discussed in our episode
3301.49 on heat and the use of sauna
and heat, but also hot baths.
3304.86 It turns out that hot baths and sauna
3307.43 can be very beneficial
for reducing cortisol.
3309.64 All the details on that are
included in the episode on heat
3311.88 and it's timestamped, so
you can go directly to that
3314.15 if you want to learn
about the temperatures
3315.57 and the various durations,
but to just give
3317.89 a synopsis of that, a 20
minute sauna at anywhere
3323.43 from 80 to a hundred degrees
Celsius is going to be
3327.56 beneficial for reducing cortisol.
3329.57 If you don't have access to a sauna,
3331.33 you could do a hot bath,
adjust the temperature
3333.88 so you don't burn yourself.
3334.86 I think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius
3336.72 is going to be too hot for many people
3338.08 if it's a hot bath, whereas
many people who can't tolerate
3341.66 that hot bath can tolerate the sauna.
3343.22 So safety first always, and of course,
3346.04 but hot baths reduce cortisol,
hot saunas, reduce cortisol
3351.73 of a duration about 20 or 30
minutes is going to be beneficial.
3354.46 And of course, some of you
may be interested in exploring
3356.51 the supplementation route and
for reductions in cortisol,
3359.25 really the chief player
there is ashwagandha,
3363.21 which is known to decrease
cortisol, fairly potently.
3366.85 I should just warn you
that if you're going to use
3368.57 ashwagandha in order to
reduce cortisol, first of all,
3372.01 check with your doctor
or healthcare provider
3373.84 before adding or subtracting anything
3375.57 from your supplementation
or health regimen.
3377.41 Of course, I don't just
say that to protect us.
3379.03 I say that to protect you,
3381.405 you are responsible for your health,
3382.238 what you take and what you don't take.
3385.32 Chronic supplementation with
ashwagandha can have some
3388.3 not so great effects of disruption
of other hormone pathways
3391.58 and neurotransmitter pathways.
3393.1 So the limit seems to be
about two weeks of regular use
3396.58 before you'd want to take
a break of about two weeks.
3399.34 So ashwagandha again, a very
potent inhibitor of cortisol,
3402.96 but with some other effects as well,
3404.676 don't use it chronically
for longer than two weeks.
3407.43 But if your goal is to reduce cortisol,
3409.5 let's say you're going
through a period of increased
3411.72 irritability and aggressive tendency,
3413.76 maybe you're also not
getting as much light
3415.44 as you would like, and
perhaps also, if there are
3418.12 other circumstantial
things leading you towards
3420.74 more aggressiveness and
your goal is to reduce
3422.55 aggressiveness, that can
be potentially helpful.
3425.2 And in light of all this stuff
about cortisol and estrogen
3428.708 and day length, I should
mention that there are in fact,
3433.22 some people who have a
genetic predisposition
3436.25 to be more irritable and aggressive,
3439.567 and there are a couple of
different gene pathways
3441.95 associated with this.
3443.13 We never like to think about just one gene
3445.38 causing a specific behavior.
3447.157 The way to think about genes
is that genes generally code
3450.66 for things within our biology.
3453.67 In the context of today's
discussion, things like
3455.95 neural circuits or the
amounts of neurotransmitters
3458.81 that are made, or the amounts
of hormones that are made,
3460.77 or the amount of neurotransmitter
hormone receptors
3463.36 or enzymes, et cetera,
that shift the activity
3467.16 of our biology in a particular direction.
3469.47 They bias our biology.
3471.66 And in fact, there is a
genetic variant present
3475.94 in certain people that adjusts
3479.1 their estrogen receptor sensitivity,
3481.64 and that estrogen receptor
sensitivity can result
3485.83 in increased levels of aggression,
3488.027 sometimes dramatic increases, however,
3491.51 and also very interestingly, photo period,
3494.09 meaning day length, is a strong
modulator of whether or not
3498.86 that aggressiveness turns up or not.
3500.96 Whether or not that person with
the particular gene variant
3505.12 is more aggressive or not,
depends on how long the day is
3508.75 and how long the night is.
3510.33 One particular study that
I like that references this
3512.779 is Trainer, et al, the
title of the study is
3515.617 "Photo period reverses
the effects of estrogens
3518.22 on male aggression, via genomic
and non-genomic pathways."
3521.7 This was a paper published
in the proceedings
3523.56 of the National Academy of Sciences.
3525.38 We'll put a reference to
this in the show notes,
3527.56 if you'd like to explore it further,
3529.27 but it really points to the
fact that rarely, sometimes,
3533.41 but rarely, is it the
case that just one gene
3536.97 will cause somebody to
be hyper aggressive.
3540.34 Almost always there's
going to be an interplay
3542.27 between genetics and environment
and as environment changes
3545.76 such as day length changes and
the length of night changes,
3548.56 so too, will the tendency for people
3550.69 with a given genetic variant
to be more aggressive or not.
3554.65 Now, of course, in the absence
of detailed genetic testing
3557.38 for this particular
estrogen receptor variant,
3559.5 most people, I'm guessing
you, are probably
3561.53 not walking around knowing
that you have this gene or not.
3566.15 Regardless, I think it's
important to pay attention
3568.85 to how you feel at
different times of year,
3571.17 depending on whether or not summer,
3573.08 whether or not it's winter,
3573.913 whether or not you're
getting sufficient sunlight,
3575.682 meaning viewing sufficient
sunlight or not,
3578.19 whether or not you're getting
sufficient sunlight exposure
3580.19 to your skin or not, whether or not
3581.68 you're indoors all the time.
3582.94 Generally those things
correlate with season,
3586.33 but not always.
3587.57 You can go through long bouts of hard work
3590.28 in the summer months when days are long,
3591.94 but you're indoors a lot and
getting a lot of fluorescent
3594.11 light exposure late in the evening.
3595.45 And perhaps that's when you're
feeling more aggressive.
3597.69 So we have to be careful
about drawing a one-to-one
3599.81 relationship between
any biological feature
3602.5 and certainly psychological
or behavioral feature
3604.94 like aggressiveness, but
it's, I believe, helpful
3607.77 to know that these genetic biases exist,
3611.07 how they play out again,
they shift our biology
3613.43 in a general thematic direction.
3616.69 They don't change one thing.
3617.78 They change a variety of things
that bias us toward or away
3620.4 from certain psychological
and behavioral outcomes
3623.15 and the various things that we can do
3625.73 in order to offset them.
3627.007 And we described those
earlier in terms of trying
3628.95 to keep cortisol low by
getting sufficient sunlight
3631.14 regardless of time of year, and
regardless of whether or not
3634.39 you happen to have this
particular genetic variant.
3636.73 So earlier I talked about
how it is testosterone
3639.25 converted into estrogen
that's activating aggression
3642.23 in the ventromedial hypothalamus,
not testosterone itself.
3645.56 However, there are some
studies carried out in humans
3648.143 that have evaluated the
effects of testosterone
3651.34 and how levels of testosterone
correlate with aggressiveness
3654.5 in the short term.
3656.24 I'm just going to detail
a few of those studies
3658.0 because I think they are
interesting and important.
3662.51 First of all, there is a
study that has explored
3665.13 levels of testosterone in
men of different professions.
3669.08 Now, before I tell you the data,
3670.5 I want to be very clear here,
with a study such as this,
3674.73 one never knows whether or not these men
3677.31 went into a particular profession because
3679.53 they had a testosterone
level of a given value
3684.02 or whether or not the work itself
3686.45 altered their testosterone levels or both.
3690.34 And I think it's fair to
assume that it's probably both.
3694.36 So be very careful in assuming
that a given testosterone
3698.27 level is causal for
choosing a particular career
3701.41 or that a particular career is causal
3703.165 for creating a particular
testosterone level.
3706.3 This study used salivary
testosterone levels
3709.51 as the measure, which to
be fair is not the best way
3713.46 to measure testosterone.
3715.3 Typically blood draw would be the best way
3717.21 to measure testosterone,
but nonetheless, provided
3719.9 the appropriate methods are
used, salivary testosterone
3722.88 can be a reasonable
measure of testosterone.
3725.86 The different occupations
that were looked at were,
3729.74 and here they just looked at
men in this particular study
3732.48 were ministers, salesmen, they didn't say
3735.02 what particular types
of salesmen, firemen,
3737.42 professors, of all things,
physicians and NFL players.
3741.77 And what they discovered was
that the testosterone levels
3746.35 were essentially in that
order from low to highest.
3749.43 So minister, salesman, fireman,
3751.18 professor, physician, NFL player.
3754.04 Now we could micro dissect
all the different stereotypes
3758.55 and all the different features
of each of these jobs.
3761.35 For instance, we don't know
whether or not the fact
3764.32 that the firemen happened,
at least in this study
3767.19 to have lower testosterone
levels on average
3769.69 than the professors or the physicians
3771.63 was because firemen have
lower testosterone levels
3774.06 or because they have a
much more stressful job
3776.01 and their cortisol levels
are higher than the professor
3779.7 or the physician and cortisol
and testosterone, not always,
3783.53 but generally are in somewhat
antagonistic push-pull mode
3787.73 because they derive from the
same precursor, et cetera.
3789.77 Typically, when cortisol is high,
3792.21 testosterone tends to
be lower and vice versa.
3793.974 So we don't know what's
causing these effects.
3796.856 And again, this is just one
study and just six occupations,
3800.722 but I think it's relatively
interesting given the fact
3803.23 that each of these professions
involves different levels
3805.23 of competitiveness, right?
3807.42 So we don't necessarily
just want to think about
3809.15 the level of physical
exertion that's required,
3812.54 but also the level of
competitiveness because it's known
3815.04 that competitive interactions
can cause increases
3817.97 in testosterone, in
particular, in the winners
3821.7 of competitive interactions,
a topic for a future podcast.
3825.3 Meanwhile, studies that
have analyzed also again,
3829.02 salivary testosterone in
prisoners, in this case,
3833.73 female prisoners, so these
are incarcerated individuals,
3837.44 have looked at levels of testosterone
3839.78 according to whether or
not the person committed
3842.66 a non-violent or a violent crime in order
3845.05 to arrive in prison.
3846.32 And higher levels of salivary
testosterone were related
3850.93 to those that had arrived in prison
3853.82 because of conviction of a violent crime,
3856.79 as opposed to a nonviolent crime.
3858.63 Likewise, when they analyzed
prison rule violations,
3861.83 so an indirect measure of
aggressiveness, but in this case,
3864.99 it was strongly associated
with aggressiveness
3867.31 because they knew what
the violations were,
3869.3 they found were for
prisoners that had none,
3872.09 no prison violations, prison
rule violations I should say,
3876.34 their testosterone
levels tended to be lower
3879.56 than the testosterone levels
of women that had some,
3882.89 even one, or more aggressive
violations of prison rules.
3888.05 We'll provide links to these
studies in the show notes
3891.47 if you'd like to go into them further,
3893.52 obviously studies like
this need to be taken
3895.38 with a grain of salt
because there are so many
3897.73 different factors, different
prisons have different degrees
3900.96 of violence to begin with and
competitiveness to begin with.
3905.49 But just as a final pass
at examining the role
3908.02 between testosterone and aggressiveness,
3910.001 there was a very interesting
study from Goetz, et al,
3913.703 G-O-E-T-Z published in
2014, that looked at serum,
3919.67 so in this case, blood
levels of testosterone.
3921.67 30 minutes after application
of a gel-based testosterone
3926.65 that goes transdermal
so that the testosterone
3928.82 can go very quickly into the bloodstream,
3930.54 and then did brain imaging
to evaluate the activity
3934.514 of neurons in the so-called
corticomedial amygdala,
3938.91 the cortico, the medial
amygdala is one of the areas
3941.58 of the amygdala complex as we
call it because it's complex,
3944.5 it's got a lot of different nuclei,
3946.25 you know, know what nuclei
are, low clusters of neurons.
3948.29 It's got a lot of different
ones, but that medial
3950.9 and that cortico medial
amygdala in particular,
3954.01 is known to be associated with
aggressive type behaviors.
3957.3 It's linked up with as part
of the larger circuit that
3960.18 includes the ventromedial
hypothalamus and other brain areas
3963.61 that we referred to
earlier, such as the PAG.
3966.89 What is remarkable about this
study is that it showed that
3970.47 just 30 minutes after
application of this so-called
3973.81 AndroGel, this testosterone that seeps
3975.81 into the bloodstream,
there was a significant
3978.39 increase in of course, testosterone
3981.16 and corticomedial amygdala activation.
3985.41 So testosterone can have acute effects,
3987.95 immediate effects on the
pathways related to aggression.
3991.27 And I think this is something
that's not often discussed
3993.64 because many of the
effects of steroid hormones
3996.32 like testosterone, and
estrogen are very slow acting.
3998.67 In fact, steroid hormones,
because they have a certain
4002.66 biochemical composition can actually pass
4004.67 through the membranes of
cells, so the outside of a cell
4007.22 and into the nucleus of the cell
4008.71 and change gene expression in the cell,
4010.72 you think about puberty,
the kid that goes home
4012.32 for the summer and then comes back
4013.81 looking completely different.
4015.15 Well that's because of a
lot of genes got turned on
4017.28 by steroid hormones like
testosterone and estrogen,
4020.74 but the steroid hormones can also
4022.53 have very fast acting
effects and with testosterone
4026.44 in particular, those can
be remarkably fast acting
4028.91 and one of the most apparent
and well documented fast acting
4032.24 effects is this effect: the
ability to activate cells within
4035.43 the amygdala, so you might say,
4036.727 "Well, I thought the amygdala
was associated with fear?"
4038.79 Wouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No.
4041.24 Turns out that the amygdala
harbors, both cortisol,
4045.05 corticosteroid receptors
and testosterone receptors,
4047.88 and they each adjust the activity
4049.87 in the amygdala differently,
4051.68 such that testosterone tends
to activate amygdala circuitry
4056.17 for inducing states of mind and body
4060.12 that are more action based
and indeed in animals
4063.06 and in humans, testosterone
application and activation
4065.88 of this corticomedial amygdala pathway
4067.8 will make animals and
humans lean into effort.
4070.13 This is why I say testosterone
makes effort feel good,
4072.56 or at least biases the organism
4074.68 toward leaning into challenge.
4076.37 So if you recall, there's not
just one type of aggression,
4079.7 there's reactive aggression,
4081.7 which is triggered when one
is confronted with something
4084.53 that sometimes is inevitable, right?
4086.64 One needs to fight for their life
4087.99 or for somebody else's life,
but also proactive aggression
4092.38 and proactive aggression
involves activation
4094.8 of those go-pathways in the basal ganglia
4096.925 and a leaning into effort to overcome
4099.13 whatever state one happens
to be in to begin with.
4102.07 And so this is very important
because it points to the fact
4104.59 that yes, estrogen is
activating aggression pathways
4108.069 that are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,
4110.63 but it's very likely the case
that testosterone is acting
4113.75 to accelerate or to bias
states of mind and body
4118.14 toward those that will lead to aggression.
4120.59 Again, aggression is not
like a switch, on and off.
4123.18 It's a process.
4124.07 It has a beginning, a middle and an end.
4126.65 Remember that hydraulic pressure
4128.35 that Conrad Lorenz hypothesized?
4131.0 Well, think of testosterone
as increasing the pressure
4135.042 toward an aggressive
episode and then estrogen
4138.43 actually triggering
that aggressive episode
4140.66 in the ventromedial hypothalamus.
4142.44 So if somebody tells
you that testosterone,
4145.02 endogenous or exogenous
makes people aggressive,
4147.81 tell them no, testosterone tends to make
4150.76 people lean into effort.
4153.16 And if that effort
involves being aggressive,
4156.39 either reactively aggressive
or proactively aggressive,
4160.32 well then it will indeed
lead to aggression.
4162.7 But the actual aggression
itself is triggered by estrogen,
4167.14 not testosterone.
4168.43 Now, thus far, we really
haven't talked too much
4170.172 about the social context
in which aggression occurs.
4174.69 And that's because there
is a near infinite,
4176.54 if not infinite number of variables
4179.023 that will determine that.
4180.37 So for instance, violent
aggression is entirely appropriate
4183.673 at a professional boxing match provided
4186.63 it's occurring inside the ring and only
4188.71 between the competitors
and within the bounds
4191.536 of the rules of the sport, et cetera.
4195.8 However, there are some
things that tend to bias
4199.78 certain social context
toward being more aggressive
4202.42 or less aggressive and not
always physical aggression.
4205.5 And those generally come in two forms
4208.3 that many of you are familiar with,
4209.61 which are alcohol and caffeine.
4212.484 Let's discuss caffeine first.
4215.06 Why would caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity?
4218.33 Well, the general effects of caffeine
4220.42 are to increase autonomic arousal.
4222.23 The activity of the
so-called sympathetic arm
4225.15 of the autonomic nervous system,
4226.88 which is to put it very
much in plain language
4230.72 it's the alertness arm
of your nervous system.
4234.4 That is, it creates a sense of readiness
4237.15 in your brain and body and
it does so by activating
4240.04 the so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.
4241.89 Again, as I always remind people,
4243.31 simpa and sympathetic
does not mean sympathy.
4246.71 Simpa means together, we're all at ones.
4249.72 And caffeine tends to
bias our brain and body
4254.22 to activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,
4257.37 which run from about the base of your neck
4259.55 until the top of your pelvis
and deploy a bunch of chemicals
4263.32 that jut out into the rest of your body,
4264.9 activate adrenaline release.
4266.119 There's a parallel increase in
of adrenaline in your brain,
4270.18 creating the state of
alertness and readiness.
4272.104 That state of alertness
and readiness can be
4274.27 for all sorts of things,
not just aggression.
4276.93 However when we are in
a state of increased
4279.9 sympathetic tone, meaning more alert,
4282.284 such as after drinking caffeine,
4284.546 we will bias all those brain
and body systems, the hormones,
4289.06 the chemicals, et cetera that exist,
4291.32 toward action as opposed to inaction.
4294.4 So put simply, caffeine
can increase impulsivity,
4297.88 no surprise there.
4299.9 On the opposite end of things,
alcohol tends to decrease
4304.719 activity in the sympathetic
arm of the autonomic
4307.74 nervous system, tends to
make us feel less alert.
4310.06 Now, initially it can
create a state of alertness
4312.62 because of its effects in
inhibiting the forebrain,
4315.22 our forebrain prefrontal
cortex in particular
4317.715 has what's called top-down inhibition.
4319.96 It exerts a inhibitory
or a quieting effect
4324.09 on some of the circuits
of the hypothalamus,
4325.88 such as the ventromedial hypothalamus.
4328.06 The way to conceptualize
this is that your forebrain
4330.16 is able to rationalize and think clearly
4332.49 and to suppress behavior and
to engage the no-go pathways
4335.97 telling you, "Don't say that mean thing."
4338.437 "Don't do that violent thing," et cetera.
4340.8 Alcohol initially tends
to increase our level
4344.46 of overall activity by
reducing inhibition,
4347.8 not just in that forebrain
circuit, but in other circuits.
4351.09 Tends to make us more active.
4352.24 We tend to talk more
than we normally would,
4354.11 move more than we normally would,
4355.69 but very shortly thereafter
starts acting as a sedative
4359.62 by way of reducing
activity in the forebrain,
4363.44 releasing some of the
deeper brain circuits
4366.02 that are involved in impulsivity,
4367.58 but also causing a
somewhat sedative effect.
4371.17 And then of course, as alcohol
levels increase even further,
4374.12 people eventually will pass
out, blackout, et cetera.
4377.98 So what we've got with
alcohol and caffeine
4379.96 is we've got two opposite
ends of the spectrum,
4381.97 caffeine increasing arousal and readiness,
4384.81 and the tendency for impulsivity
and alcohol also increasing
4388.552 impulsivity, but through
a different mechanism.
4394.7 A really interesting study,
and I should just mention
4397.1 that the title of the study is,
4398.447 "Caffeinated and
non-caffeinated alcohol use
4400.93 and indirect aggression at the
impact of self-regulation."
4403.84 So the title is almost self-explanatory.
4405.99 This was a paper published
in the Journal of Addictive
4408.13 Behavior in 2016, examining
how ingestion of alcohol
4414.22 that's either caffeinated
or non-decaffeinated
4416.44 alcohol drinks impacted what
they call indirect aggression.
4420.91 And just to remind you what
indirect aggression is,
4422.8 these are not physical acts of aggression.
4424.86 These are verbal acts of aggression,
4426.51 so embarrassing others or otherwise,
4429.92 somehow trying to reduce
the wellbeing of others
4432.96 by saying certain things
in particular in groups,
4436.1 this study examined
both males and females.
4438.73 This was done on by way
of a college campus study,
4442.21 subjects were 18 to 47 years old.
4444.77 I guess there's some older
students on that campus,
4446.36 or maybe they use some
non-students, but you know,
4448.04 these days you've also got some students
4449.43 that are in their thirties and forties.
4451.03 So they have a fairly broad
swath of subjects included,
4455.24 fairly broad racial
background as well, included,
4458.54 not at equal numbers, but
at least they included
4461.07 a pretty broad spectrum of people
4462.59 with different backgrounds.
4463.77 They looked in particular
people that ingested
4467.21 non-caffeinated alcohol
drinks at a frequency
4469.9 of 9.18 drinks per week, okay.
4473.0 Again, there's a college campus,
not that I encourage that.
4475.17 I'm one of these people that I don't,
4477.4 I've never really liked drugs or alcohol
4479.2 and sort fortunate in that
way I can drink or not drink
4481.88 and tend to not drink.
4483.74 But so to me, 9.18, drinks
per week sounds like a lot,
4487.63 but I know for some people
that might actually be typical.
4490.38 And then others who are drinking at least
4493.33 one caffeinated alcoholic
beverage per week.
4496.85 And those individuals end as high,
4499.53 I should say as 7.87 caffeinated
alcohol beverages per week.
4504.43 So this would be energy drinks combined,
4505.85 typically with hard alcohol,
4507.17 that's fairly commonly
available in bars and so forth.
4510.87 And some individuals
drank as much as goodness,
4514.48 20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total,
4518.72 some that were caffeinated,
some that were not caffeinated.
4521.68 The basic outcome of this study was that
4524.53 the more alcohol someone
tended to consume,
4526.78 the more likely it was
that they would engage
4528.58 in these indirect
aggressive type behaviors.
4531.87 And in terms of the caffeinated
alcoholic beverages,
4534.56 there, the effect was
especially interesting.
4536.19 Here I'm just going to
paraphrase or I'll actually
4537.94 read from the study, quote,
"With regard to caffeinated
4542.09 alcoholic beverage use,
our findings indicated
4544.33 that heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use
4546.95 was associated positively
with indirect aggression,
4549.47 even after considering
one's typical alcohol use
4551.92 and dispositional aggression."
4553.93 What this means is that
even though alcohol
4556.814 can bias certain individuals
to be more aggressive,
4559.5 and even though certain
individuals already have
4561.43 a disposition toward
being more aggressive,
4563.8 there was an effect that was independent,
4566.229 meaning above and beyond both
alcohol and a predisposition,
4570.818 meaning if someone was consuming
4573.52 caffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had
4575.84 a particularly high likelihood of engaging
4578.585 in indirect aggressive behavior.
4581.41 Now this makes perfect
sense in light of the model
4583.9 they propose, which is
this self-regulation model,
4587.38 that basically self-regulation
involves several things.
4589.62 It involves engaging in certain behaviors
4592.1 and suppressing other behaviors.
4593.44 So as described before,
because alcohol tends to have
4598.42 a sedative suppressive
effect on the autonomic
4601.71 nervous system, at least
after the initial period,
4605.38 it's going to tend to
reduce the likelihood
4607.91 that people will engage
in any type of behavior.
4610.57 Whereas caffeine will
increase autonomic arousal
4613.11 and increase the likelihood
that someone will engage
4615.62 in a particular type of behavior,
aggressive or otherwise.
4618.96 So the combination of caffeine
and alcohol is really acting
4622.24 as a two prong system
to bias people towards
4625.01 more impulsivity that
is less self-regulation.
4627.86 So it's really yanking
your volitional control,
4630.99 your ability to engage in
prefrontal top down inhibition
4634.33 over your hypothalamus from two distinct
4636.96 and specific circuits.
4638.06 By now, you should be
getting the impression
4639.72 that self-regulation is a key feature
4642.33 of whether or not
somebody, maybe even you,
4645.46 is going to engage in aggressive speech
4647.31 or aggressive behavior.
4648.57 And we've talked about a number
of tools that one can use
4650.61 to reduce the probability
that that will happen.
4654.36 I suppose, if the
context were appropriate,
4656.39 you could even take those
tool recommendations
4659.41 and just invert them and
increase the likelihood
4661.95 that aggressiveness would happen.
4663.5 But regardless, self-regulation is key.
4667.0 And in light of that, I want
to share with you a study
4669.82 that's focused on kids, but
that has important ramifications
4675.21 for adults as well.
4676.426 As you probably are already
aware there are many kids
4681.16 out there that suffer from so-called
4682.63 attention deficit
hyperactivity, disorder, ADHD.
4685.64 There are also many adults we are finding
4687.39 that are suffering from ADHD.
4689.2 And there's also an epidemic
I would say of people
4692.9 that are concerned about
whether or not they have ADHD.
4695.56 Now whether or not they have true,
4696.88 clinical ADHD or not, is not clear.
4699.55 We did an episode all about
ADHD and tools for ADHD.
4702.87 I would encourage you to
check out that episode
4704.307 and some of the diagnostic criteria.
4706.84 If you have the opportunity you
can find at hubermanlab.com,
4709.709 as this study I'm about to
share with you aptly points out,
4714.42 there is no objective
diagnostic marker of ADHD.
4717.01 There's no biomarker or blood
draw or blood test for ADHD,
4720.62 whether or not one has ADHD
depends on their performance
4724.91 on a number of different cognitive tests
4726.93 and behavioral tests and self report.
4729.66 In any event, the study
I'm about to share with you
4732.31 explored how a particular
pattern of supplementation
4735.56 in kids with ADHD was able
to reduce aggressive episodes
4740.28 and impulsivity and
increased self-regulation.
4743.49 And the title of the study is,
4745.077 "Efficacy of carnitine in
the treatment of children
4747.47 with attention deficit,
hyperactivity disorder."
4750.15 Even though they put
carnitine in the title,
4752.05 that what they focused
on was whether or not
4754.42 acetyl-L-carnitine
supplementation could somehow
4758.13 adjust the behavioral tendency
of these kids with ADHD
4761.3 and to make a long story
short, indeed it did.
4764.42 There was a very significant
effect of acetyl L-carnitine
4767.12 supplementation on improving
some of the symptomology,
4770.009 excuse me, of ADHD.
4773.268 A few details about this study
4775.05 that might be relevant to you.
4776.7 This was a randomized double
blind placebo controlled double
4779.14 crossover study, this was
done as an outpatient study.
4782.66 So the kids weren't in a hospital,
4784.24 they were living out in the world.
4785.56 This again was done on younger kids.
4787.37 So this was six to six to 13 year old kids
4790.97 that were diagnosed with ADHD.
4793.176 They received either acetyl
L-carnitine or placebo,
4798.476 and they did all the good practice stuff
4802.7 that good researchers do of making sure
4804.32 that the placebo and
the acetyl L-carnitine
4806.76 had similar look and taste.
4808.88 It was consumed twice daily after meals.
4811.88 I should just mentioned
that acetyl L-carnitine
4813.44 typically is taken in
capsule form or occasionally
4817.12 an injectable form.
4817.97 Here, they they were
using this as a drink,
4819.72 which essentially the
same as capsule form,
4821.5 but the powders just
going directly into liquid
4823.97 and the carnitine dosage was
100 milligrams per kilogram.
4827.96 So they're doing this
according to the body weight
4829.78 of these kids with a maximum
dosage of four grams per day,
4834.33 the quantity of the
medication was supplied here.
4836.28 I'm reading for a period of
eight weeks and every eight
4838.41 weeks a new quantity of
medication was supplied.
4840.3 So basically this is a
fairly long term study,
4843.414 exploring behavioral outcomes
and psychological outcomes
4848.27 in week eight, 16 and 24.
4850.76 They also looked at blood
things that you could only get
4854.02 through a blood draw, so things
like hemoglobin, hematocrit,
4856.221 red blood cell count, white
blood cell count, et cetera,
4857.527 they, these are kids and
even if it were adults,
4860.77 they were quite appropriately examining
4862.63 a lot of the physiological measures
4864.03 that one would want to
carry out to make sure,
4867.66 first of all, that blood levels
of carnitine are increasing.
4870.87 And indeed they confirmed
that, but also that
4872.84 no negative effects are
showing up in the physiology
4876.26 as well as the psychology of these kids.
4877.94 So, first I'll just tell you
the basic outcome of the study,
4880.04 which was, here I'm paraphrasing,
4881.707 "Here, given twice
daily, carnitine appeared
4883.35 to be effective and well tolerated
4884.72 treatment for a group
of children with ADHD."
4886.927 "They showed significant,
the abnormal behavior
4889.5 compared to these other boys."
4891.73 And now I'm moving to
the table of results.
4895.13 They showed significant reductions
4896.7 in their so-called "Total Problem Score."
4899.01 The total problem score is
a well-established measure
4901.15 of behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.
4904.777 And I should say adults with ADHD,
4907.33 has to do with challenges
in social and learning
4911.26 environments and how well or poorly
4914.12 an individual tends to perform.
4916.1 Reductions in intentional
problems, overall reductions
4918.57 in delinquency, and most important
4920.38 for sake of today's discussion,
4921.97 significant reductions
in aggressive behavior.
4924.73 Now what's especially nice
about this study, I think,
4926.764 is that even though it's
a relatively small number
4929.011 of subjects and certainly
needs to be repeated
4932.703 in other studies and other laboratories,
4936.07 that they were able to confirm
the shifts in L-carnitine
4941.17 within the bloodstream of these kids,
4942.44 that is they were able to
correlate the physiology
4944.8 with the psychological
changes, in studies like this.
4948.39 And frankly in all studies
of human pharmacology,
4951.87 you have to worry about
effects that show up,
4953.74 not just because of placebo effects,
4955.6 but because of so-called
off target effects
4957.66 or related things, totally
independent of the drug
4960.894 or the particular
supplement that you happen
4962.76 to be looking at,
4963.87 to put in the words of
a great neuroscientist.
4966.51 Unfortunately, he passed
away some years ago,
4968.72 but he was a member of
the national academy,
4970.14 extremely accomplished
neuroscientist once turned to me
4974.14 and said, "Never forget
a drug is a substance
4977.22 that when injected into
an animal or a human being
4980.84 creates a paper," meaning you
can see effects of pretty much
4985.95 any drug or any supplement
in most all conditions.
4989.35 However, it is in cases
such as this study,
4992.13 where you can quite convincingly
see that the particular
4996.9 feature of physiology that
you expected to change,
4999.54 actually changed.
5001.22 And you see a psychological outcome
5003.46 that you can gain much greater
confidence that the changes
5007.55 in delinquency, in this
case reduced delinquency,
5010.15 improved attention, reduced
aggressiveness and so forth
5013.2 was at least somehow related to the shift
5016.69 in blood physiology and
levels of L-carnitine
5020.01 or acetyl L-carnitine and
carnitine in the bloodstream
5022.68 of these children, as
opposed to something else
5024.93 like L-carnitine going and
affecting some downstream target
5028.48 that you have no knowledge of.
5029.61 Now, of course that's
still entirely possible,
5032.09 but I think studies such as
these increase our confidence
5034.74 that things like L-carnitine can be used
5037.87 perhaps in concert with things
like omega 3 supplementation,
5041.24 diets that are biased towards
increasing more tryptophan
5044.49 and therefore more serotonin,
5046.91 obviously avoiding things like alcohol
5048.75 and as it appears from the
study I just described,
5051.01 reducing one's intake or not consuming
5054.92 any caffeinated alcoholic
beverages seems like
5057.407 it would be a good idea if your goal is
5058.41 to reduce aggressiveness, to
think about the hormone context
5061.176 and whether or not you tend
to have higher testosterone,
5065.51 an estrogen or lower
testosterone, an estrogen,
5067.88 maybe even think about
the work environment,
5069.39 whether or not you are
existing in a particularly
5071.64 competitive work environment
and even day life,
5075.19 time of year and whether or not
5076.61 you're getting sufficient
sunlight, whether or not
5078.24 you're avoiding light in
the evening and so on.
5080.71 So studies such as this I think are useful
5082.96 because they point to the fact
that very seldom, if ever,
5087.91 will there be one supplement
or one nutritional change
5091.36 or even one behavioral change,
5092.77 that's going to completely
shift in individual
5094.777 from being aggressive and impulsive,
5097.29 but rather that by combining
different behavioral regimens,
5101.7 by paying attention to
things like time of year
5104.35 and work conditions and school conditions
5106.42 and overall levels of
stress and likely therefore
5109.63 levels of cortisol, et cetera,
5111.094 that you can use behaviors,
diet, and supplementation
5114.98 as a way to shift that overall
internal milieu from one
5119.09 of providing a lot of
internal hydraulic pressure
5122.08 as it's been called throughout the episode
5124.14 toward aggressive impulsivity and relax
5127.32 some of that hydraulic pressure
5129.44 and reduce aggressive tendencies.
5131.84 So once again, and frankly, as always,
5134.52 we've done a deep dive
into the neurobiology
5138.36 and the psychology of what I believe to be
5140.58 an important feature of our
lives, in this case aggression.
5143.33 I want to point out that in a episode
5146.3 in the not too distant future,
I'm going to be hosting
5148.441 Dr. Professor David Anderson
from Caltech University,
5152.34 who is the world expert on the
neurobiology of aggression.
5157.01 In fact, he is the senior
author on many of the studies
5159.24 related to the ventromedial hypothalamus
5161.32 that I discussed today.
5162.92 Our discussion will touch
on aggression, of course.
5165.92 So hearing today's episode will help you
5168.52 digest that information, but
we are also going to talk
5170.72 about other emotional states.
5172.37 He is an expert, not just in aggression,
5174.28 but in motivated states related
to sex and mating behavior,
5178.0 social relationships of all
kinds and how those relate,
5181.84 not just to biology and psychology,
5183.5 but also certain forms of pathology,
5185.91 things like PTSD and the
relationship for instance,
5188.11 between anger, fear,
anxiety, and depression,
5191.155 and many other important
topics that I know many of you,
5194.57 if not all of you will be interested in.
5196.4 In the meantime, I want to point you
5197.66 to his recently released
and wonderful book entitled,
5202.327 "The Nature of the Beast,
How Emotions Guide Us."
5205.07 And again, the author is
David Anderson from Caltech.
5208.78 This is a wonderful book.
5210.46 It serves as a tremendous introduction
5213.518 to the history of the
study of these areas,
5216.41 the current science and
discoveries being made
5218.94 in these areas, all made
accessible to the scientist
5222.39 and non-scientist alike.
5223.65 It's a very engaging read and so much so
5227.55 that even though he was
gracious in sending me a copy,
5230.09 I also purchased myself a
copy to give to somebody
5232.72 who is a therapist, and
I've purchased another copy
5235.69 to give to a high school kid that I mentor
5237.99 because he's very interested
5239.0 in the neuroscience of emotions.
5240.45 And I think we are all
interested in emotions,
5242.736 not just fear and some
of these negative states,
5245.81 not just aggression, but
also the positive emotions
5248.01 of our lives.
5248.843 And so, "The Nature of the
Beast, How Emotions Guide Us,"
5251.84 by David Anderson is a wonderful read.
5254.2 I can't recommend it highly enough.

5300.66 During today's episode and
on many previous episodes
5303.03 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
5304.28 we discussed supplements.
5305.91 While supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
5308.27 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them,
5310.69 for things like improving
the transition time
5313.15 and the quality of your sleep
5315.2 and improving alertness and focus.
5317.44 And so on.
5318.57 Anytime you're considering
taking supplements,
5320.67 there are several key considerations.
5322.12 First of all, those supplements should be
5323.64 of the very highest quality.
5325.28 And you want to make sure that
what's listed on the bottle
5327.87 is actually what's in the bottle,
5329.13 which is a problem for any
supplement companies out there.
5332.21 The Huberman Lab Podcast
is pleased to announce
5334.67 that we are now partnered
with Momentous supplements
5337.75 because we believe
Momentous supplements to be
5339.92 of the very highest quality
of any supplements out there.
5343.42 And we've been working
very closely with them
5345.002 in order to direct them,
to create supplements
5347.65 that are individual ingredient supplements
5349.604 of the particular quality and sources
5352.21 that we would like to see,
5353.36 and that relate to the
science and studies covered
5355.78 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
5357.33 If you'd like to see some
of those supplements,
5359.02 you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
5362.59 and there you'll see
some of the supplements
5364.98 that we've talked about
on this podcast before
5366.87 such as magnesium threonate
for augmenting sleep,
5370.47 things like L-tyrosine
for augmenting dopamine
5372.68 and things like L-carnitine,
which we've discussed
5375.3 on today's podcast.
5376.501 Right now, the list of
supplements and the products
