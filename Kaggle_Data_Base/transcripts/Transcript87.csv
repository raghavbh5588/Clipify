0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.32,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.94,for everyday life. 
9.09,I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor 
11.01,of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
12.96,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.12,"Today, we're going to talk all about hearing and balance "
18.75,and how you can use your ability to hear specific things 
22.26,and your balance system in order to learn anything faster. 
27.03,"The auditory system, meaning the hearing system, "
29.57,"and your balance system, which is called "
31.2,"the vestibular system, interact with all the other systems "
35.56,"of the brain and body and, used properly, "
38.63,"can allow you to learn information more quickly, "
41.05,remember that information longer and with more ease 
45.07,and you can also improve the way you can hear. 
47.84,You can improve your balance. 
49.48,We're going to talk about tools for all of that. 
53.43,"This is one area of science, "
54.77,where we understand a lot about the cells 
57.67,and the mechanisms in the ear and in the brain and so forth. 
60.88,"So we're going to talk about that a little bit, "
62.51,"and then we're going to get directly into protocols, "
65.71,meaning tools. 
66.84,We're also going to talk about ways 
69.42,in which the auditory and balance system suffer. 
71.94,"We're going to talk about tinnitus, "
73.17,"which is this ringing of the ears that, "
75.581,"unfortunately, for people that suffer from it, "
78.47,they really suffer. 
79.86,It's very intrusive for them. 
81.58,We're going to talk about some treatments 
83.25,that can work in some circumstances 
85.8,and some of the more recent emerging treatments 
89.07,that I think many people aren't aware of. 
91.68,"We're also going to talk about this, "
93.21,"what seems like kind of a weird fact, "
94.87,which is that 
70%,"of people, all people, "
98.84,"make what are called otoacoustic emissions, "
102.02,their ears actually make noises. 
103.55,"Chances are your ears are making noises right now, "
106.81,but you can't perceive them. 
108.46,And yet those can have an influence on other people 
111.58,and animals in your environment. 
113.553,It's a fascinating aspect of your biology. 
116.29,You're going to learn a lot about how your biology 
119.11,and brain and ears and the so-called inner ear 
121.98,"that's associated with balance, "
123.17,"you're going to learn a lot about how all those work, "
125.53,you're going to learn a lot of neuroscience. 
127.47,I'll even tell you what type of music to listen to. 
130.02,"And if you listen to me, you can leverage that "
131.93,in order to learn faster. 
133.71,Before we begin talking about the science 
135.6,of hearing and balance and tools 
137.63,"that leverage hearing and balance for learning faster, "
140.39,I want to provide some information 
142.13,about another way to learn much faster. 
145.437,There's a paper that was published recently. 
147.85,This is a paper that was published 
149.6,"in Cell Reports, an excellent journal. "
152.43,"It's a peer-reviewed paper from a really excellent group, "
156.53,looking at skill-learning. 
159.78,"Now, previously, I've talked about how, "
162.88,"in the attempt to learn skills, the vital thing to do "
167.92,is to get lots of repetitions. 
170.61,You've heard of the 
"10,",
000,"hours thing, "
172.58,you've heard of lots of different strategies 
175.23,"for learning faster, "
80/,
20,rule and all that; 
177.601,the bottom line is you need to generate 
181.0,"many, many repetitions of something "
183.53,that you're trying to learn. 
184.69,And the errors that you generate 
186.53,are also very important for learning. 
190.11,It also turns out that taking rest 
193.837,within the learning episode is very important. 
196.56,I want to be really clear what I'm referring to here. 
198.969,"In earlier episodes, I've discussed how when you're trying "
202.38,"to learn something it's beneficial, "
204.21,"it's been shown in scientific studies, "
206.054,that if you take a 
20-minute,shallow nap 
211.11,"or you simply do nothing after a period of learning, "
213.87,that it enhances the rates of learning 
215.91,"and the depth of learning, your ability to learn "
218.95,and remember that information. 
220.85,What I'm about to describe are new data 
223.16,that say that you actually should be injecting rest 
226.66,within the learning episode. 
228.58,Now I'm not talking about going to sleep while learning. 
231.95,This is the way that the study was done: 
234.38,"the study involved, having people learn sequences "
238.25,of numbers or keys on a piano. 
240.34,So let's use the keys on a piano example. 
243.21,"I'm not a musician, but I think I'll get this correct. "
248.41,"They asked people to practice a sequence of keys, "
252.28,G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G; G-D-F-E-G. 
257.04,And they would practice that either continually 
259.3,"for a given amount of time, or they would just do that "
262.34,for 
10,"seconds, they would play G-D-F-E-G, "
265.24,"G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G for "
10,seconds. 
268.44,And then they would take a 
10-second,pause or rest. 
271.81,They would just space take a space or a period of time 
275.51,where they do nothing for 
10,seconds 
277.12,"then they would go back to G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G. "
280.49,"So the two conditions, essentially, "
284.74,"were to have people practice continually, "
286.78,"lots of repetitions, or to inject or insert "
290.7,these periods of 
10,seconds idle time 
293.46,"where they're not doing anything, "
294.6,"they're not looking at their phone, "
295.88,"they're not focusing on anything, "
297.11,they're just letting their mind drift 
299.06,wherever it wants to go 
300.67,and they are not touching the keys on the keyboard. 
304.29,"What they found was that the rates of learning, "
307.5,the skill acquisition and the retention of the skill 
310.33,was significantly faster when they injected 
312.81,"these short periods of rest, these "
10-second,rest periods. 
316.29,"And the rates of learning were, "
319.44,"when I say significantly faster, "
321.26,"were much, much faster. "
322.81,"I'll reveal what that was in just a moment, "
325.16,but you might ask why would this work? 
328.5,Why would it be that injecting these 
10-second,rest periods 
331.05,would enhance rates of learning? 
332.77,What they called them was micro-offline gains 
335.33,because they're taking their brain offline 
336.817,from the learning task for a moment. 
338.47,"Well, turns out the brain isn't going offline at all. "
342.09,"You've probably heard of the hippocampus, "
343.51,"the area of the brain involved in memory and the neocortex, "
346.53,the area of the brain that's involved 
347.82,in processing sensory information. 
350.38,"Well, it turns out that during these brief periods of rest, "
353.54,these 
10-second,"rest periods, "
355.64,the hippocampus and the cortex are active in ways 
360.019,such that you get a 
20,times repeat of the G-D-F-E-G. 
366.61,"It's a temporal compression, as they say. "
368.24,"So basically, the rehearsal continues while you rest, "
372.51,but at 
20,times the speed. 
374.73,"So if you were normally getting just, "
376.336,let's just say five repetitions 
378.97,"of G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G per "
10,seconds. 
383.13,Now you multiply that times 
20.,
385.12,"In the rest periods, you've practiced it "
100,times. 
387.76,Your brain has practiced it. 
389.13,"We know this because they were doing brain imaging, "
391.15,functional imaging of these people 
392.93,with brain scanners while they were doing this. 
395.39,This is an absolutely staggering effect 
398.96,"and it's one that, believe it or not, "
401.19,has been hypothesized or thought to exist 
403.5,for a very long time. 
408.43,This effect is called the spacing effect. 
410.95,And it was actually first proposed by Ebbington in 
1885.,
416.82,"And since then, it's been demonstrated "
418.87,"for a huge number of different, what they call domains, "
421.38,in the cognitive domain. 
422.41,"So for learning languages, in the physical domain, "
425.19,so for learning skills that involve a motor sequence. 
428.57,It's been demonstrated for a huge number 
430.75,of different categories of learning. 
434.64,If you want to learn all about the spacing effect 
437.08,"and the categories of learning that it can impact, "
439.51,there's a wonderful review article. 
441.4,I'll provide a link to it. 
443.2,The title of the review article is parallels 
446.05,between spacing effects during behavioral 
448.25,and cellular learning. 
449.14,What that review really does 
450.25,is it ties the behavioral learning 
451.707,and the improvement of skill to the underlying changes 
456.63,in neurons that can explain that learning. 
459.53,"I should mention that the paper that I'm referring to, "
462.0,the more recent paper that injects 
463.78,these 
10-second,"little micro-offline gains, "
467.92,"rest periods is the work of the laboratory of Leonard Cohen, "
472.39,"not the musician, Leonard Cohen. "
474.32,"He passed away, he was not a neuroscientist; "
476.36,"a wonderful poet and musician, but not a neuroscientist. "
479.77,"Again, the paper was published in Cell Reports "
481.45,and we will provide a link to the full paper as well. 
484.37,"So the takeaway is if you're trying to learn something, "
488.25,"you need to get those reps in, "
489.69,but one way that you can get 
20,"times, "
491.54,the number of reps in is by injecting 
494.23,these little 
10-second,periods of doing nothing. 
498.02,"Again, during those rest periods, "
499.61,"you really don't want to attend to anything else, "
501.93,as much as possible. 
502.84,"You could close your eyes if you want, "
504.31,or you can just simply wait 
505.63,and then get right back into generating repetitions. 
508.75,I find these papers that Cell Reports and other journals 
512.0,have been publishing recently to be fascinating 
514.21,because they're really helping us understand 
516.16,what are the best protocols for learning anything. 
519.11,And they really leverage the fact that the brain 
522.43,"is willing to generate repetitions for us, "
524.615,provided that we give it the rest that it needs. 
527.71,So inject rest throughout the learning period. 
529.81,"And if you can, based on the scientific data, "
532.71,you would also want to take a 
20-minute,nap 
534.88,or a 
20-minute,decompress period 
536.85,where you're not doing anything after a period of learning. 
540.13,I think those could both synergize 
542.645,"in order to enhance learning even further, "
545.21,although that hasn't been looked at yet. 
547.05,"Before we begin talking about hearing and balance, "
549.59,I just want to mention that this podcast 
551.32,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
554.3,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
556.54,to bring zero-cost to consumer information 
558.56,about science and science related tools 
560.91,to the general public. 
562.57,"In keeping with that theme, I want to thank the sponsors "
565.41,of today's podcast and make it clear 
567.92,that we only work with sponsors 
569.43,"whose products we absolutely love, "
571.36,and that we think you will benefit from as well. 
574.82,Our first sponsor is Roka. 
576.89,"Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses, "
578.9,"that, in my opinion are the very highest quality available. "
582.7,The company was founded by two all-American swimmers 
584.94,from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses 
587.9,and sunglasses were created with performance in mind. 
592.46,These eyeglasses and sunglasses have a number of features 
595.13,that really make them unique. 
596.27,"First of all, they're extremely lightweight, "
598.12,the optical clarity of the lenses is spectacular. 
601.58,"And for the sunglasses, they have this really great feature, "
604.3,"which is as you move in and out of shadows, "
607.27,"or across the day, the amount of sunshine might change, "
611.35,"you always experience the world as clear and bright, "
614.4,and that can only come from really understanding 
616.89,how the visual system works. 
618.63,The visual system has all these mechanisms 
620.53,for adaptation and habituation. 
622.69,"You don't need to know how those things work, "
624.25,but the folks at Roka clearly do 
626.23,because you put these glasses on 
627.97,and you don't even notice that they're on. 
630.07,They also stay on your face even if you get sweaty. 
632.42,"They were designed to be used while active, "
634.77,"so running and biking, et cetera or indoors. "
637.32,One thing that I really like 
638.38,about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses 
640.58,is that the aesthetic is terrific. 
642.39,"Even though they were designed for performance, "
644.58,unlike a lot of sunglasses out there 
647.02,that were designed for performance 
648.33,"that look kind of ridiculous, kind of space-age, "
650.97,"Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses, "
652.83,you could wear anywhere. 
654.162,The aesthetic is really clean 
656.22,and they have a huge number of different styles 
657.89,to select from. 
659.24,"If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses, "
660.97,"you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A, .com "
664.32,and enter the code Huberman to save 
20%,off 
667.24,your first order. 
668.29,"That's Roka, R-O-K-A, .com "
670.44,and enter the code Huberman at checkout. 
672.66,Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
675.926,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
678.42,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
681.16,to help you better understand your body 
682.77,and reach your health goals. 
684.66,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
687.77,for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact 
691.35,our immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed 
694.43,from a quality blood test. 
696.0,"And now with the advent of DNA tests, "
698.27,we can get further insight and information 
700.643,"into how our metabolism is working, "
703.8,"how our brain is functioning, how our endocrine system, "
707.61,meaning our hormone system is functioning. 
709.93,One of the issues with a lot of companies 
711.62,"and programs that involve getting blood and DNA tests, "
714.03,"however, is that you get the information back, "
716.06,you don't know what to do with that information. 
717.65,"With InsideTracker, they make all of that very easy. "
720.2,"First of all, they can send someone "
721.56,"to your home to take the samples, if you like "
723.38,or you can go to a local clinic. 
726.1,"You get the information back and, of course, "
728.01,"you get all the numbers and levels of hormone factors, "
729.941,"metabolic factors, et cetera, "
732.5,but the dashboard at InsideTracker provides directives 
735.84,so that if you want to bring those numbers up 
737.58,"or bring them down, or if you want to keep them "
739.46,"in the same range, it points to specific regimens "
742.32,"related to nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle factors "
746.5,so you can really move around those numbers 
748.22,to best suit your health goals and health status. 
751.5,"If you want to try InsideTracker, "
752.99,"you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman, "
756.05,and you'll get 
25%,off any of InsideTracker's plans. 
759.05,Just use the code Huberman at checkout. 
761.3,Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace. 
764.17,Headspace is a meditation app that's backed 
766.02,by 
25,published studies. 
768.25,"And in addition to those, "
769.292,there are hundreds of studies showing 
771.449,that meditation is beneficial for our brain 
774.89,and for our body. 
776.37,"One of the challenges, however, "
777.93,is maintaining a meditation practice. 
780.3,"I started meditating a long time ago, "
782.0,but I found it very hard to keep that practice going. 
785.08,Then I discovered the Headspace meditation app 
787.33,and what I found was that because they have meditations 
789.94,"that are very short, as well as some that are longer "
792.12,"and some that are much longer, "
794.07,I could maintain my meditation practice. 
795.67,"Sometimes I do a short five-minute meditation, "
797.67,sometimes I do 
20-minute,"meditation, "
799.74,I try and meditate at least 
20,"minutes per day, "
802.77,"but sometimes, some weeks, I only do it five times a week "
805.58,and I'll just meditate for longer. 
807.2,"So with Headspace, you have the full palette "
809.13,of meditations to select from. 
811.16,"If you want to try Headspace, "
812.45,you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer. 
815.65,"And if you do that, you'll get a free one-month trial "
818.4,"so no cost whatsoever, "
820.24,with their full library of meditations. 
821.98,So that's the best offer that they have. 
823.732,"So, again, if you want to try Headspace "
826.24,and you want to get access to all their meditations for free 
829.31,go to headspace.com/specialoffer. 
832.88,Can you hear me? 
834.62,Can you hear me? 
836.01,"Okay, well, if you can hear me, that's amazing "
838.41,because what it means is that my voice 
841.432,is causing little tiny changes in the airwaves 
844.94,wherever you happen to be. 
846.75,And that your ears and whatever's contained in those ears 
850.5,and in your brain can take those sound waves 
853.75,and make sense of them. 
854.9,And that is an absolutely fantastic 
857.55,and staggering feat of biology and yet we understand 
861.08,a lot about how that process works. 
863.74,So I'm going to teach it to you now in simple terms 
866.17,over the next few minutes. 
868.14,So what we call ears have a technical name. 
871.94,"That technical name is oracles, "
874.7,"but more often they're called pinna, "
876.97,"the pinnas, P-I-N-N-A, pinna. "
880.39,"And the pinnas of your ears, "
883.02,this outer part that is made of cartilage and stuff 
887.07,is arranged such that it can capture sound 
890.16,in the best way for your head size. 
893.36,"We're going to talk about ear size also, "
895.03,'cause it turns out that your ears change size 
897.19,across the lifespan and that how big your ears are 
901.09,or rather how fast your ears are changing size 
905.14,is a pretty good indication of how fast you're aging. 
908.17,"So we'll get to that in a few minutes, "
909.51,but I want to talk about these things that we call ears 
912.87,and some of the stuff contained within them 
915.0,that allow us to hear. 
916.68,So the shape of these ears that we have 
920.55,is such that it amplifies high-frequency sounds. 
923.35,"High frequency sounds, as the name suggests, "
925.44,is the squeakier stuff. 
927.07,"So low frequency sound, Costello snoring in the background "
930.11,"that's a low frequency sound or high frequency sound, okay? "
934.81,So we have low frequency sounds and high frequency sounds 
936.6,and everything in between. 
938.9,Now those sound waves get captured by our ears. 
941.91,"And those sound waves, for those of you "
944.29,"that don't maybe fully conceptualize sound waves, "
947.62,are literally just fluctuations or shifts 
952.01,in the way that air is moving toward your ear 
956.61,and through space. 
957.443,"In the same way that water can have waves, "
959.355,air can have waves. 
961.88,So it's reverberation of air. 
966.12,Those come in through your ears 
968.3,and you have what's called your eardrum. 
970.84,"And on the inside of your eardrum, "
973.31,there's a little bony thing that shaped 
975.45,like a little hammer. 
976.49,"So attached to that eardrum, "
978.56,"which can move back and forth like a drum, "
980.327,"it's a little membrane, you got this hammer attached to it. "
984.45,And that hammer has three parts. 
986.35,"For those of you that want to know, "
987.34,"those three parts are called malleus, incus and stapes. "
991.166,"But basically, you can just think about it as a hammer. "
993.55,So you've got this eardrum and then a hammer. 
996.19,And then that hammer has to hammer on something. 
999.1,And what it does is it hammers on a little coiled piece 
1003.5,"of tissue that we call the cochlea, "
1005.76,"sometimes called the cochlea, "
1007.07,depending on where somebody lives in the country. 
1010.06,"So, typically, in the Midwest, on the East Coast, "
1011.96,they call them coh-chleah. 
1013.0,"And on the West Coast, we call them caw-cochlea, same thing. "
1017.32,So this snail-shaped structure in your inner ear 
1021.28,is where sound gets converted into electrical signals 
1025.05,that the brain can understand. 
1026.9,But I want to just bring your attention 
1028.58,to that little hammer because that little hammer 
1030.92,"is really, really cool. "
1032.25,"What it means is that sound waves come in through your ears, "
1034.46,"that's what's happening right now, "
1036.32,"that eardrum that you have, it's like the top of a drum. "
1040.14,"It's like a membrane, or it can move back and forth. "
1043.02,It's not super rigid and it moves that little hammer. 
1045.85,"And then the hammer goes, doom-doom-doom-doom "
1047.83,and hits this coil-shaped thing 
1051.11,that we're calling the cochlea. 
1054.06,"Now the cochlea, at one end, is more rigid than the other. "
1059.64,So one part can move really easily 
1061.49,and the other part doesn't move very easily. 
1064.35,And that turns out to be very important 
1066.64,for decoding or separating sounds that are low frequency 
1071.93,like Costello's snoring and sounds 
1074.2,"that are of high frequency, like a shriek or a shrill. "
1079.05,"And that's because within that little coil thing, "
1083.88,"we call the cochlea, you have all these tiny little "
1087.63,what are called hair cells. 
1089.77,"Now they look like hairs, but they're not at all related "
1092.37,to the hairs on your head or elsewhere on your body. 
1095.23,"They're just shaped like hair, so we call them hair cells. "
1098.69,"Those hair cells, if they move, send signals into the brain "
1103.712,that a particular sound is in our environment. 
1106.8,"And if those hair cells don't move, "
1108.64,it means that particular sound is not in our environment. 
1112.6,"So just to give you the mental picture of this, "
1115.64,"sound waves are coming in, because there's stuff out there, "
1119.25,making noises like my voice; 
1120.96,it's changing the patterns of air around you 
1124.03,"in very, very subtle ways; "
1125.98,that information is getting funneled into your ears 
1128.97,because your pinnas are shaped in a particular way. 
1131.67,The eardrum then moves this little hammer 
1134.18,and the hammer bangs on this little snail-shaped thing. 
1137.79,"And because that snail-shaped thing, at one end, "
1141.02,"is very rigid, it doesn't want to move "
1142.81,"and at the other end, it's very flexible, "
1145.15,it can separate out high-frequency and low-frequency sounds. 
1149.66,And the fact that this thing in your inner ear 
1152.3,"that we call the cochlea is coiled, "
1154.48,is actually really important to understand 
1157.119,"because along its length, "
1159.69,"it varies in how rigid or flexible it is, "
1162.3,"I already mentioned that before and at the base, "
1166.3,"it's very rigid and that's where the hair cells, "
1170.35,"if they move, will make high-frequency sounds, "
1173.92,"and at the top, what's called the apex, "
1175.97,it's very flexible and it's more like a bass drum. 
1179.01,So basically what happens is sound waves come 
1181.273,into your ears and then at one end of this thing 
1185.15,"that we call the cochlea, at the top, "
1188.04,it's essentially encoding or only responding 
1192.13,"to sounds that are like, doom-doom-doom-doom. "
1195.1,"Whereas, at the bottom, it responds to high-frequency sounds "
1199.07,"like a cymbal, [clanging]. "
1203.14,"And everywhere in between, we have other frequencies, "
1206.89,medium frequencies. 
1208.68,Now this should stagger your mind. 
1211.7,"If it doesn't already, it should. "
1213.75,Because what this means is that everything 
1216.92,"that's happening around us, "
1218.12,whether or not it's music or voices or crying 
1220.76,or screaming or screaming of delight from small children 
1224.74,"who are excited, 'cause they're playing "
1226.21,or 'cause they get cake; 
1228.08,all of that is being broken down into its component parts 
1232.38,and then your brain is making sense of what it means. 
1236.13,"These things that I've been talking about, "
1237.99,like the pinna of your ears and this little hammer 
1240.74,"and the cochlea, that's all purely mechanical. "
1243.77,It has no mind of its own. 
1245.48,"It's just breaking things down into high frequencies, "
1248.11,medium frequencies and low frequencies. 
1250.11,"And if you don't understand sound frequency, "
1251.88,"it's really simple to understand, "
1254.11,just imagine ripples on a pond. 
1256.2,"And if those ripples are very close together, "
1258.84,that's high frequency; they occur at high frequency. 
1261.99,"If those ripples are further apart, it's low frequency. "
1265.4,"And obviously, medium frequency is in between. "
1267.43,"So just like you can have waves in water, "
1269.048,you can have waves in air. 
1270.17,So that's really how it works. 
1272.39,Now we are all familiar with light 
1276.73,"and how, if you take a prism and put it in front of light, "
1280.29,"it will split that light into its different wavelengths, "
1283.01,"its different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera. "
1287.545,"So like the Pink Floyd ""Dark Side of the Moon"" album, "
1289.81,"I think, has a prism and it's converting white light "
1292.87,"into all the colors, all the wavelengths "
1295.79,that are contained in white light. 
1297.61,"Your cochlea, essentially, acts as a prism. "
1300.76,It takes all the sound in your environment 
1303.03,and it splits up those sounds into different frequencies. 
1306.78,"So you can think of the cochlea of your ear, "
1308.95,sort of like a prism and then the brain takes 
1311.64,that information and puts it back together 
1313.72,and makes sense of it. 
1315.13,"So those hair cells in each of your two cochlea, "
1317.653,"because you have two ears, you also have two cochlea, "
1321.38,"send little wires, what we call axons "
1324.91,that convey their patterns of activity into the brain. 
1329.61,And there are a number of different stations 
1332.23,within the brain that information arrives at 
1334.83,"before it gets up to the parts of your brain, "
1337.15,where you are consciously aware. 
1339.13,And because some of you have asked for more names 
1341.27,"and nomenclature, I'll give that to you. "
1342.64,"If you don't want a lot of detailed names, "
1345.18,you can just ignore what I'm about to say. 
1346.77,"But, basically, the cochlea send information "
1349.98,to what's called the spiral ganglion. 
1353.13,"A ganglion, by the way, if you're going to learn "
1355.14,"any neuroscience, just know that anytime you hear ganglion, "
1358.0,"a ganglion is just a clump, so it means a bunch of neurons. "
1361.93,So a clump of cells. 
1363.62,So the spiral ganglion is a bunch of neurons 
1366.18,that the information then goes off 
1368.05,to what are called the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem. 
1371.77,"Brainstem is down near your neck, "
1374.02,then up to a structure that has a really cool name 
1375.89,"called the superior olive, "
1377.27,because you have one on each side of your brain. 
1379.82,And if I were to bring you to my lab and show you 
1382.45,"the superior olives in your brain or anyone else's brain, "
1385.55,"they look like little olives, "
1387.23,"even that little divot in them that to me, "
1389.128,"it looks like a pimiento, "
1390.66,but they just call them the superior olive. 
1393.32,"And then the neurons in the superior olive, "
1395.57,then they send information up 
1396.97,"to what's called the inferior colliculus, "
1398.72,only called inferior because it sits below 
1400.88,a structure called the superior colliculus. 
1402.94,And then the information goes up to what's called 
1405.06,the medial geniculate nucleus. 
1407.38,And then up to your neocortex 
1408.93,where you make sense of it all. 
1411.51,"Now you don't have to remember all that, "
1412.95,but you should know that there are a lot of stations 
1416.65,in which auditory information is processed 
1419.14,before it gets up to our conscious detection. 
1423.6,"And there is a good reason for that, "
1425.9,which is that more important than knowing 
1428.93,"what you're hearing, you need to know "
1431.5,where it's coming from. 
1434.49,"It's vital to our survival, that if something, for instance, "
1437.75,"is falling toward us, that we know if it's coming "
1440.23,"to our right side, if it's going to hit us from behind, "
1443.26,"we have to know, for instance, "
1444.3,if a car is coming at us from our left or from our right. 
1447.65,And our visual system can help with that. 
1450.5,But our auditory and our visual system collaborate 
1453.07,to help us find and locate the position of things in space. 
1457.87,That should come as no surprise. 
1459.55,"If you hear somebody talking off to your right, "
1462.43,"you tend to turn to your right, not to your left. "
1464.8,"If you see somebody's mouth moving in front of you, "
1468.25,you tend to assume that the sound is going to come 
1469.96,from right in front of you. 
1472.24,Disruptions in this auditory hearing 
1475.97,and visual matching are actually the basis 
1479.03,"of what's called the ventriloquism effect, "
1481.28,which we'll talk about in a few minutes in more depth. 
1484.14,But the ventriloquism effect can basically be described 
1487.5,in simple terms as when you essentially think 
1491.76,that a sound is coming from a location 
1494.14,that it's not actually coming from. 
1497.29,We'll talk about that in a moment 
1498.44,but what I'd like you to realize 
1501.1,"is that one of these stations, deep in your brainstem "
1505.07,is responsible for helping you identify where sounds 
1508.21,are coming from through a process 
1510.49,that's called interaural time differences. 
1512.91,"And that sounds fancy, but really, "
1514.88,"the way you know where things are coming from, "
1518.02,what direction a car or a boss or a person is coming from 
1521.33,is because the sound lands in one ear before the other. 
1525.02,"And you have stations in your brain, "
1527.294,meaning you have neurons in your brain 
1529.21,that calculate the difference in time of arrival 
1531.89,for those sound waves in your right versus your left ear. 
1535.38,"And if they arrive at the same time, "
1537.27,you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you. 
1541.02,"If it's off to your right, "
1542.25,you assume it's over on your right. 
1543.79,"And if the sound arrives first to your left ear, "
1545.656,"you assume, quite correctly, "
1547.85,that the thing is coming toward your left ear. 
1550.96,So it's a very simple and mechanical system 
1553.75,at the level of sound localization. 
1557.92,But what about up and down? 
1559.29,"If you think about it, a sound coming from above "
1561.61,is going to land on your right ear 
1562.89,and your left ear at the same time. 
1565.81,A sound from below is going to land on your right ear 
1567.77,and your left ear at the same time. 
1569.55,So the way that we know where things are 
1572.75,"in terms of what's called elevation, "
1575.26,where they are in the up and down plane 
1579.05,is by the frequencies. 
1581.35,The shape of your ears actually modifies the sound 
1585.49,"depending on whether or not it's coming straight at you, "
1587.81,from the floor or from high above. 
1590.78,"And so already at the level of your ears, "
1594.39,you are taking information about the outside world 
1597.17,and determining where that information is coming from. 
1600.8,"Now, this all happens very, very fast and it's subconscious "
1604.15,"but now you know why if people really want to hear something, "
1608.73,they make a cup around their ear. 
1611.65,They essentially make their ear 
1613.32,into more of a fennec fox type ear. 
1615.75,"If you've ever seen those cute little fennec fox things, "
1618.4,"they have these big spiky ears, "
1619.85,"they look like a French bulldog, "
1621.47,although the fox version version of the French bulldog. 
1624.48,"This big, tall ears, "
1626.12,and they have excellent sound localization. 
1628.29,"And so when people lean in with their ear, "
1630.705,"with their hand like this, if you're listening to this, "
1633.04,"I'm just cupping my hand at my ear, "
1635.26,I'm giving myself a bigger pinna. 
1638.18,"And if I do it on the left side, I can do this side. "
1640.19,"And if I really want to hear something, I do it on both sides. "
1643.69,"So this isn't just gesturing, "
1645.35,this actually serves a mechanical role. 
1647.43,"And actually, if you want to hear where things "
1649.46,"are coming from with a much greater degree of accuracy, "
1653.74,this can actually help because you're capturing sound waves 
1656.98,and funneling them better. 
1659.373,"It's really remarkable, this whole system. "
1662.49,So you've got these two ears and because of the differences 
1664.95,"in the timing of when things arrive in those two ears, "
1667.6,as well as these differences in the frequencies 
1669.841,"that certain things sound, "
1672.92,or I should say the differences in the frequencies 
1675.567,"that arrive at your ears, "
1677.32,depending on whether or not the thing is above you 
1679.97,"or right in front of you or below you, "
1681.64,you're able to make out where things are 
1683.05,in space pretty well. 
1684.37,So now you're probably starting to realize 
1686.17,that these two things on the side of our head 
1687.65,that we call ears are there for a lot more 
1690.76,than hanging earrings on or for other aesthetic purposes 
1694.9,or for putting sunglasses on top of. 
1697.66,They are very powerful devices 
1701.3,for allowing us to capture sound waves from our environment. 
1706.62,"Now I have a question for you, "
1708.66,"which is, can you move your ears? "
1711.98,"It turns out that unlike other animals, "
1715.52,humans are not terrifically good at moving their ears. 
1718.95,Other animals can move their ears even independently. 
1722.28,"So Costello is pretty good at raising his ears, "
1724.9,"the two of them together, "
1725.8,He can't really move his ear separately. 
1728.35,Some dogs can do that really well. 
1730.53,"In fact, sighthounds and some scenthounds "
1733.79,do that exquisitely well. 
1735.51,Some animals like deer and other animals 
1738.48,that really have very acute hearing 
1742.11,will put one ear down to a very particular angle 
1745.99,and will tilt the other one 
1747.22,and they will actually capture information 
1750.57,"about two distant sound-making organisms, "
1755.06,those could be hunters coming after them 
1756.98,or other animals coming after them. 
1758.65,They are very good at doing this. 
1760.25,We're not so good at it. 
1761.47,But about 
60%,"of people, it's thought, "
1764.99,can move their ears consciously 
1767.56,without having to touch their ear. 
1769.24,So can you do that? 
1770.71,Maybe you should try it. 
1771.543,Ask someone to look at you 
1772.98,and see whether or not you can do it. 
1774.48,The typical distances that people can move it 
1777.73,is usually no more than two or three millimeters. 
1780.34,It's subtle but can you flap your pinna 
1782.537,with just using mental control? 
1785.77,"If you can, or if you can't, "
1789.084,try looking all the way to your right 
1792.12,or all the way to your left. 
1793.123,"Obviously, if you're driving a car "
1794.96,"or doing something or exercising, "
1796.52,don't put yourself in danger right now. 
1797.82,"But if you move your eyes all the way to your left, "
1801.42,"which I'm doing now or all the way to my right, "
1804.05,you might feel a little bit of a contraction of the muscles 
1807.149,that control ear movement. 
1811.85,Now I want to ask you this: can you raise one eyebrow? 
1814.59,"I'm not very good at it, I can do a little bit, "
1816.62,but it's mostly by like cramping down my face on one side. 
1820.08,And I certainly can't raise my right eyebrow. 
1822.33,I can only do my left eyebrow. 
1824.65,"Trying to talk while I'm doing this, "
1825.483,that's why it looks strange. 
1827.08,"People who can raise one eyebrow very easily, "
1831.33,"almost always, can move their ears "
1833.89,without having to touch them. 
1835.5,It's controlled by the same motor pathway. 
1839.54,"And there does seem to be a small, "
1841.48,but statistically significant sex difference 
1843.731,in the ability to move one's ears. 
1847.22,"Typically, men can do this more than women can, "
1850.5,although plenty of women can move their ears as well. 
1854.4,"Now, if you think that is all a little strange or off topic, "
1857.97,it's not because what we're really talking about here 
1861.009,"is a system of the brain, but also of the body "
1865.52,of the musculature for localizing things in space. 
1868.44,And so you might find it interesting to note 
1871.26,that one of the things that we share very closely 
1874.68,"with other primates, with non-human primates, "
1877.98,"like macaque monkeys and chimpanzees, "
1880.52,"if you look at their ears, "
1882.55,"their ears are remarkably similar to our ears, "
1885.83,or rather our ears are remarkably similar to their ears. 
1889.94,The eyes of certain monkeys like macaque monkeys 
1893.67,are remarkably similar to human eyes. 
1896.94,"This is one of the reasons why, "
1898.15,"if you look at a baby macaque monkey, "
1900.12,it has this unbelievably human element to it. 
1904.34,But the ears of these primates is very similar 
1906.95,"to our ears; our ears, similar to their ears. "
1911.68,If you're interested in ear movements 
1914.22,and what they could mean and some of the things 
1917.54,that ear movements correlate with in other aspects 
1920.34,"of our biology, there's a nice paper, actually, "
1923.03,a scientific paper. 
1924.293,"The author's last name is Code, C-O-D-E, "
1927.97,it was published in 
1995.,
1929.65,I'll give a reference to that. 
1931.05,It's a review article that discusses 
1933.51,"some of the sex differences in ear movement control, "
1936.95,as well as the relationship between ear movements 
1938.96,and eye movements. 
1940.2,And it's a pretty accessible paper. 
1941.88,It's one that I think any of you who are interested 
1944.11,in this topic could parse fairly easily. 
1947.05,And there's some very interesting underlying biology 
1949.9,and some theories as to why humans 
1952.24,would have this so-called vestigial 
1954.35,or ancient carry-over of a system for moving our ears. 
1958.82,"Now, if ear movement seems strange, "
1963.04,"next, I want to talk about a different feature "
1965.258,"of your hearing and ears that's even stranger, "
1969.96,but that has some really interesting implications 
1972.663,for your biology. 
1975.7,And I'm guessing that you've not heard of this. 
1981.14,What am I about to describe 
1982.38,are called otoacoustic emissions. 
1985.2,"And otoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests, "
1988.21,are sounds that your ears make. 
1992.26,"Believe it or not, "
70%,of people make noises 
1997.08,"with their ears, but they don't actually detect them. "
2000.41,"Like I said, you've never heard of this. "
2001.87,"Okay, that's not what I mean. "
2004.62,But what I do mean is that 
70%,of people's ears 
2008.72,are making noise that's cast out of the ear. 
2011.97,"And these otoacoustic emissions, actually, "
2013.87,can be detected by microphones. 
2015.41,Sometimes they can be detected by other people 
2017.9,in the room if they have very good hearing. 
2020.52,"Now, it turns out that women or, I should be technical here, "
2025.21,"females who report themselves as heterosexual, "
2029.87,"have a higher frequency, not frequency of sound, "
2032.7,but a higher frequency of otoacoustic emissions 
2036.88,than do men who report themselves as heterosexual. 
2040.47,"Women who report themselves as homosexual or bisexual, "
2045.68,make fewer otoacoustic emissions than heterosexual women. 
2050.69,These are data that come from Dennis McFadden's lab 
2053.66,"at the University of Texas, Austin. "
2055.72,"He actually discovered these, "
2057.51,what are called sexual dimorphisms and differences 
2060.51,based on sexual orientation without looking for them. 
2063.57,He was studying hearing. 
2065.01,He's a auditory scientist and people were coming 
2068.05,into his laboratory and they were detecting 
2070.23,these otoacoustic emissions. 
2071.43,And they started to notice the group differences 
2075.07,in otoacoustic emissions. 
2076.3,So they started asking people about their sex 
2079.33,and about their sexual orientation. 
2081.36,"And these differences fell out of the data, as we say. "
2085.34,And it's interesting because otoacoustic emissions 
2088.48,are not something that we associate 
2089.81,with sex or sexual dimorphism. 
2092.39,"But what these data really underscore is, first of all, "
2095.63,"a lot of us are making noises with our ears, "
2097.8,some of us more than others. 
2099.45,And that exposure to certain combinations of hormones 
2104.25,during development are very likely shaping the way 
2107.52,"that our hearing apparati, meaning the cochlea "
2110.67,"and the pinna and all sorts of things, "
2112.59,how those develop and how those functions 
2114.44,throughout the lifespan. 
2115.66,"We did do an episode on hormones and sexual development, "
2119.21,which gets much deeper into the other effects 
2121.97,that hormones have on the developing brain and body. 
2124.42,"If you want to check out that episode, "
2126.239,we will put a link to it in the captions. 
2129.87,So now I want to shift to talking 
2131.3,"about ways to leverage your hearing system, "
2134.86,"your auditory system so that you can learn anything, "
2137.9,"not just auditory information, but anything faster. "
2141.95,I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural beats. 
2145.96,"Binaural beats, as their name suggests, "
2148.25,involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear 
2152.51,and a different frequency of sound to the other ear. 
2155.23,"So it might be doomed, doon, doon, doon to your right ear, "
2159.23,and it might be to ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding 
2161.64,to the left ear. 
2163.05,And the idea is that the brain 
2165.86,will take those two frequencies of sound 
2168.952,and because the pathways that bring information 
2172.3,"from the ears into the brain, eventually crossover, "
2174.92,they actually share that information with both sides 
2177.64,"of the brain, that the brain will average that information "
2180.939,and come up with this sort of intermediate frequency. 
2185.05,And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies 
2188.38,place the brain into a state that is better for learning. 
2192.49,"And when I say better for learning, "
2194.7,I want to be precise about what I mean. 
2196.66,That could mean more focus for encoding 
2199.592,or bringing the information in. 
2202.86,"As you may have heard me say before, "
2204.76,we have to be alert and focused in order to learn. 
2207.28,There is no passive learning 
2208.49,unless we're little tiny infants. 
2211.06,So can binaural beats make us more focused? 
2214.81,Can binaural beats allow us to relax more if we're anxious? 
2218.8,"I know some people, they go to the dentist "
2220.33,and the dentist offers binaural beats 
2222.4,as they drill into your teeth and give root canals 
2224.69,"and things of that sort, probably causing some anxiety "
2226.85,just describing those things right now. 
2229.75,But those are available in many dental practices. 
2235.033,"Binaural beats have been thought to increase creativity, "
2238.52,or at least they have been proposed to increase creativity. 
2240.66,So what does the scientific data say about binaural beats? 
2243.37,There are a number of different apps out there 
2245.14,that offer binaural beats. 
2247.02,There are a number of different programs. 
2248.53,I think you can also even just find these on YouTube 
2251.197,and on the internet. 
2252.2,"But typically, it's an app and you'll program in "
2254.61,a particular outcome that you want: 
2256.16,"more focused, more creative, fall asleep, "
2258.44,"less anxious, et cetera. "
2260.54,So what does the scientific data say? 
2262.45,"So believe it or not, the science on binaural beats "
2265.1,is actually quite extensive and very precise. 
2268.55,"So sound waves are measured, typically, "
2271.99,in hertz or kilohertz. 
2273.53,I know many of you aren't familiar 
2274.81,with thinking about things in hertz or kilohertz. 
2276.94,"But again, just remember those waves on a pond, "
2279.72,those ripples on a pond. 
2281.5,"If they're close together, then they are of high-frequency. "
2286.47,"And if they're far apart, than they are of low frequency. "
2288.73,"So when you hear more hertz, "
2290.88,what you're essentially hearing is higher frequency. 
2294.69,And so if it's many more kilohertz 
2296.35,then it's much higher frequency 
2297.57,than if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz. 
2299.57,And so you may have heard of these things as delta waves 
2303.25,"or theta waves or alpha waves or beta waves, et cetera. "
2306.72,"Delta waves would be big, slow waves, so low frequency. "
2310.35,"And, indeed, there is quality evidence "
2313.116,from peer-reviewed studies that are not sponsored 
2316.11,by companies that make binaural beat apps 
2318.522,"that tell us that delta waves like one to four hertz, "
2322.8,"so very low frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, "
2326.32,can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep. 
2331.09,"And that theta rhythms, "
2332.72,which are more like four to eight hertz 
2335.06,can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep 
2340.62,"or meditation, so deeply relaxed, but not fully asleep. "
2344.35,And then you can sort of ascend 
2345.85,"the staircase of findings here, so to speak. "
2347.92,"And you'll find evidence that alpha waves, "
2349.9,eight to 
13,hertz can increase alertness 
2352.62,to a moderate level. 
2354.03,That's a great state for the brain to be in 
2356.39,for recall of existing information. 
2360.282,"And that beta waves, "
15,to 
20,hertz 
2362.881,are great for bringing the brain 
2365.38,into focus states for sustained thought 
2369.13,or for incorporating new information 
2371.69,"and especially gamma waves, the highest frequency, "
2374.14,"the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak, "
2377.71,
32,to 
100,hertz for learning and problem-solving. 
2381.64,"Now, all of this matches, or I should say, "
2384.21,maps onto what I've said before 
2386.79,"about learning really nicely, "
2388.58,which is that you need to be in a highly alert state 
2390.9,"in order to bring new information in, "
2392.88,in order to access a state of mind 
2395.48,in which you can tell your brain or the brain 
2398.06,"is telling itself, okay, I need to learn this. "
2399.91,This is why stress and unfortunate circumstances 
2402.101,are so memorable is because our brain gets 
2404.5,into a really high alert system. 
2406.13,"Here, we're talking about the use of binaural beats "
2408.42,in order to increase our level of alertness 
2411.25,or our level of calmness. 
2414.18,Now that's important to underscore because it's not 
2416.843,that there's something fundamentally important 
2419.05,about the binaural beats. 
2420.81,They are yet another way of bringing the brain 
2423.43,into states of deep relaxation 
2426.1,through low frequency sound or highly alert states 
2429.88,for focused learning with more high-frequency sound. 
2433.49,So they are effective and I'll review a little bit 
2436.79,"of the data in detail, they're effective, "
2440.07,but it's not that they're uniquely special for learning. 
2444.96,It's just that they can help some people bring 
2447.22,their brain into the state that allows them to learn better. 
2450.86,"So there are a lot of studies that allowed us to arrive, "
2455.08,or I should say allowed the field to arrive 
2457.77,"on these parameters of slow, slow, "
2461.69,"low frequency waves are going to bring you into relaxed states, "
2463.93,high frequency waves into more alert states. 
2468.27,There's very good evidence for anxiety reduction 
2471.66,from the use of binaural beats. 
2474.31,And what's interesting is anxiety reduction seems 
2478.7,to be most effective when the binaural beats 
2483.01,"are bringing the brain into delta, "
2485.32,"so those slow big waves like sleep, theta and alpha states. "
2490.29,And I'll link to a couple of these studies 
2492.33,although I will probably link more to the list 
2496.06,that really segregates them out one by one 
2498.06,so you can see them all next to one another. 
2499.601,There's good evidence that binaural beats 
2501.6,"can be used to treat pain, chronic pain. "
2503.89,There's three studies in peer-reviewed journals 
2507.68,"which I took a look at, and they seem to be of good quality, "
2511.62,"not sponsored research, as we say, "
2513.56,not paid for by any specific company. 
2516.0,Binaural beats have been shown 
2517.17,"to modestly improve cognition, "
2520.09,"attention, working memory and even creativity. "
2523.72,But the real boost from binaural beats appears 
2527.05,to be for anxiety reduction and pain reduction. 
2531.03,Some people might find these beneficial 
2532.72,"for these oral surgeries, right? "
2535.633,"Believe it or not, there are people "
2537.47,who would rather have the entire root canal 
2541.81,or cavity drilled without Novocaine. 
2544.26,And that's because they sometimes have a syringe phobia 
2547.56,or something of that sort 
2548.393,"or they just don't like being numb from the Novocaine, "
2550.17,or maybe there's an underlying medical reason. 
2552.13,But I think most people do don't enjoy getting 
2554.63,their teeth drilled even if they have Novocaine in there 
2556.68,or a root canal. 
2557.89,And so it seems that binaural beats can be effective 
2560.54,in that environment. 
2561.72,And you don't have to go 
2562.65,into that sort of extreme environment 
2564.04,to benefit from binaural beats. 
2565.42,Binaural beats are a either relatively inexpensive thing 
2571.41,"to access, most of the apps are pretty inexpensive. "
2573.76,I don't have a favorite binaural beats app 
2576.52,to recommend to you. 
2577.71,I confess I did use binaural beats a few years ago. 
2580.17,"I shifted over to other what I call NSDR, "
2584.07,"non-sleep deep rest protocols in favor of those, "
2586.55,but many people like binaural beats 
2588.63,"and say that they benefit from them, "
2590.75,especially while studying or learning. 
2593.49,I think part of the reason for that relates 
2596.12,to the ability to channel our focus 
2599.38,when we have some background noise. 
2601.37,And this is something I also get asked about a lot. 
2604.17,Is it better to listen to music and have background noise 
2606.863,when studying or is it better to have complete silence? 
2609.85,"Well, there's actually a quite good literature "
2612.42,"on this as well, but not so much as it relates "
2615.24,"to binaural beats, but rather whether or not people "
2617.93,"are listening to music, so-called white noise, brown noise; "
2622.49,"believe it or not, there's white noise "
2623.61,"and there's brown noise, there's even pink noise "
2626.12,and how that impacts brain states 
2629.16,that allow us to learn information better or not. 
2632.35,So now I'd like to talk about white noise 
2635.15,and I want to be very clear that white noise 
2638.01,has been shown to really enhance brain states for learning 
2642.52,"in certain individuals, in particular, in adults. "
2646.5,But white noise actually can have a detrimental effect 
2649.52,on auditory learning and maybe even the development 
2652.07,of the auditory system in very young children 
2654.92,in particular in infants. 
2656.98,So first I'd like to talk 
2658.07,about the beneficial effects of white noise on learning. 
2662.424,There are some really excellent studies on this. 
2665.49,The first one that I'd like 
2666.5,to just highlight is one that's entitled: 
2670.34,Low Intensity White Noise Improves Performance 
2672.83,"in Auditory Working Memory Task, an fMRI Study. "
2676.01,This is a study that explored 
2679.55,whether or not learning could be enhanced 
2683.03,by playing white noise in the background. 
2686.14,But the strength of the study is that they looked 
2688.9,at some of the underlying neural circuitry 
2690.447,and the activation of the neural circuitry 
2692.34,in these people as they did the learning task. 
2694.41,"And what it, essentially, illustrates "
2696.81,"is that white noise, provided that white noise "
2700.29,"is of low enough intensity, meaning not super loud, "
2704.566,"not imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can't hear it, "
2709.14,"but not super loud either, "
2710.78,it actually could enhance learning to a significant degree. 
2713.77,And this has been shown now 
2715.0,for a huge number of different types of learning. 
2719.89,There's a terrific article as well 
2722.18,"in a somewhat obscure journal, at least, "
2723.93,"obscure to me, which is: "
2724.91,The Effects of Noise Exposure on Cognitive Performance 
2727.48,and Brain Activity Patterns. 
2730.29,That's a study involving 
54,subjects. 
2733.6,"They, basically, were evaluated for mental workload "
2736.43,"and attention under different levels of noise exposure, "
2739.73,"background noise and different, essentially, "
2742.48,loudness of noise. 
2743.59,And the reason I like this study is that they looked 
2745.79,"at different levels of noise and types of noise, "
2747.506,"and they varied a number of different things, "
2750.48,"as opposed to just doing a two-condition, "
2752.81,either white noise or no white noise type thing. 
2755.28,"And what they found, again, is that provided the white noise "
2758.85,"is not extremely loud, "
2760.73,it could really enhance brain function 
2762.96,for sake of learning any number 
2764.55,of different kinds of information. 
2767.44,"Now that's all great, but it really doesn't get to "
2770.664,the deeper guts of mechanism. 
2772.93,"And as a neuroscientist, what I really want to see "
2775.15,is not just that something has an effect. 
2776.91,That's always nice. 
2777.743,It's always nice to see in a nice peer-reviewed study 
2780.37,without any kind of commercial biases 
2782.39,"that there's an effect, binaural beats can enhance learning "
2785.3,"or listening to white noise, not too loud "
2787.51,can enhance learning. 
2788.97,But you really want to understand mechanism 
2791.61,"because once you understand mechanism, "
2794.81,"not only does it start to make sense, "
2796.34,but you can also imagine ways in which 
2797.927,you could develop better tools and protocols. 
2800.71,"So I was very relieved to find, "
2803.54,or I should say excited to find this study published 
2806.23,"in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, "
2808.5,this is a 
2014,"paper, White Noise Improves Learning "
2813.24,by Modulating Activity in Dopaminergic Mid-Brain Regions 
2817.41,and Right Superior Temporal Sulcus. 
2819.67,Now I don't expect you to know 
2820.54,what the right spirit temporal sulcus is. 
2822.039,I don't expect you to know 
2823.53,"what the dopamine midbrain region is, but if you're like me, "
2827.33,you probably took highlighted notice 
2829.77,of the word dopaminergic. 
2831.26,"Dopamine is a neuromodulator, meaning it's a chemical "
2834.77,"that's released in our brain and body, "
2836.47,"but mostly in our brain that modulates, "
2840.16,meaning controls the likelihood 
2843.15,that certain brain areas will be active 
2844.83,and other brain areas won't be active. 
2846.53,And dopamine is associated with motivation. 
2848.77,Dopamine is associated with craving. 
2850.55,"Motivation is associated with all sorts of different things, "
2852.84,including movement but what this study so nicely shows 
2858.11,is that white noise can really enhance 
2862.25,the activity of neurons in what's called 
2863.97,the substantia nigra VTA. 
2865.85,The substantia nigra VTA is a very rich source of dopamine 
2870.27,and that's because it's very chockablock full 
2873.67,of dopamine neurons. 
2875.54,"It's an area of the brain that is, perhaps, "
2878.18,the richest source of dopamine neurons. 
2881.31,And you actually can see this brain region 
2883.78,under the microscope if you take a slice of brain 
2885.53,or you look at a brain without even staining it 
2888.24,for any proteins or dopamine or anything. 
2890.49,It's two very dark regions at the bottom of the brain. 
2894.74,"And the reason it's called substantia nigra, "
2897.54,nigra meaning dark is because the dopamine neurons 
2901.28,actually make something that makes those neurons dark. 
2905.75,"And so you've got these two regions down there, "
2907.713,that contain dopamine and can release dopamine 
2910.6,"and, essentially, activate other brain regions "
2913.0,and activate our sense of motivation 
2914.72,and activate our sense of desire 
2916.74,to continue focusing and learning. 
2919.04,But you can't just snap your fingers 
2921.49,and make them release dopamine. 
2922.52,You actually have to trigger dopamine release from them. 
2924.98,Now that trigger can be caused by being very excited 
2928.02,about something or the fact that that thing gave you 
2930.83,"a lot of pleasure in the past, "
2932.19,or you're highly motivated by fear or desire. 
2935.2,But what's so interesting to me is that it appears 
2938.63,"that white noise itself can raise what we call the basal, "
2943.43,the baseline levels of dopamine that are being released 
2946.58,"from this area, the substantia nigra. "
2949.32,So now we're starting to get a more full picture 
2953.03,of how particular sounds in our environment 
2955.7,can increase learning. 
2958.3,"And that's, in part, I believe, "
2960.46,through the release of dopamine from substantia nigra. 
2964.75,"So I'm not trying to shift you away from binaural beats, "
2968.26,"if that's your thing, but it does appear "
2970.86,"that turning on white noise at a low level, not too loud. "
2973.89,"You may say, ""Well, how loud?"" "
2975.13,"And I'll tell you in a moment, "
2976.18,but not too loud can allow you to learn better 
2979.39,because of the ways that it's modulating 
2981.31,your brain chemistry. 
2982.69,So how loud or how soft should that white noise be 
2986.628,while you learn? 
2988.94,"Well, in these studies, it seemed that white noise "
2992.49,"that could be heard by the person, "
2994.35,"so it wasn't imperceptible to them, "
2995.87,"so it was loud enough that they could hear, but not so loud "
3001.11,that they felt it was intrusive or irritating to them. 
3005.8,So that's going to differ from person to person 
3007.68,because people have different levels 
3009.13,of auditory sensitivity. 
3010.9,"It's going to depend on age, going to depend "
3012.3,on a number of different factors. 
3013.84,So I can't tell you turn to level two 
3016.281,on your volume controller. 
3017.95,That's just not going to work. 
3018.783,"Also, I don't know how far you are "
3020.11,from a given speaker in the room 
3021.63,or if you've got earphones in your head 
3023.47,or you've got speakers in the room 
3026.11,or if it's coming out of your computer. 
3027.81,I don't know those things. 
3029.0,So what you're going to have to do is adjust 
3030.35,that white noise to the place 
3032.24,"where it's not interfering with your ability to focus, "
3035.11,but rather it's enhancing your ability to focus. 
3037.84,I think a good rule of thumb is going to be to put it 
3042.07,"probably on the lower third of any kind of volume dial, "
3046.11,"as opposed to in the upper third, "
3049.21,where it would really be blasting. 
3051.52,"And really blasting any noise, frankly, is not good, "
3055.87,"but that's especially not good, meaning it's especially bad "
3059.65,if you have headphones in. 
3061.48,I do want to mention something about headphones 
3063.5,before I talk about white noise in the developmental context 
3067.04,and why it can be dangerous there. 
3069.63,"When you put headphones in your ears, "
3073.89,it has this incredible effect of making the sounds 
3077.77,"like they come from inside your head, "
3079.73,not from out in the room. 
3081.71,"And now that might seem like kind of a duh, "
3083.76,"but that's actually really amazing, right? "
3085.9,Your brain assumes that the sounds 
3087.77,"are coming from inside your head, "
3090.14,as opposed from the environment 
3091.64,that you're in the moment you put headphones in. 
3093.63,So if you're listening to an audiobook 
3094.98,"or maybe you're listening to this podcast with headphones, "
3097.29,that's very different than when you're listening 
3099.14,"to something out in the room and there are other sounds, "
3101.68,"other sound waves, especially if you use "
3103.24,these noise-cancellation headphones. 
3105.22,So if you're going to use white noise to enhance studying 
3109.55,"or learning of any kind, this also could be "
3111.36,"for skill-learning, motor skill-learning "
3112.78,"while you're exercising, my suggestion would be "
3116.8,"that if you're using headphones, to keep it quite low. "
3120.31,This is an effect on the midbrain dopamine neurons 
3123.42,that's a background effect of raising 
3125.16,the baseline of dopamine release. 
3126.73,"The way that dopamine neurons fires, they're always firing; "
3128.91,"yours are firing right now, so are mine, "
3130.72,"when something exciting happens, they fire a lot. "
3133.02,"And when something disappointing happens, "
3134.41,"that firing, the release of dopamine "
3136.34,goes down below baseline. 
3138.01,What you're talking about here is raising 
3139.6,"your overall levels of attention and motivation, "
3141.66,which translate to better learning 
3143.48,"by just tickling those neurons a little bit, "
3146.33,raising the baseline firing. 
3149.06,You're not turning up the white noise 
3150.2,to the point where you're feeling amazing. 
3152.1,This isn't like turning on your favorite song. 
3154.1,This is actually the opposite. 
3155.83,This is about getting that baseline up just a bit. 
3159.93,So I recommend turning the volume up just a bit 
3163.46,so that you can focus entirely on the task 
3166.78,that you're trying to do. 
3167.613,"And, of course, you've turned on white noise "
3169.29,so your attention might drift to that for a moment. 
3170.9,Is it too loud? Is it too soft? 
3172.87,"If you can disappear into the work, so to speak, "
3175.33,"if your attention can disappear into the work, "
3177.18,then that's probably sufficiently quiet. 
3180.31,"And for those of you that say, "
3181.33,"well, I like really loud music "
3182.6,"and if I just blast the music, "
3184.43,then I forget about the music. 
3186.86,I don't suggest blasting music. 
3188.58,And this is coming from somebody 
3189.57,who really likes loud music. 
3192.25,"I grew up with kind of a loud fast rules mentality, "
3194.67,"and if you don't know what loud fast rules means, "
3197.43,"then I can't help you, but there's a time and a place, "
3202.08,"perhaps, to listen to music loud "
3203.67,"but, especially, with headphones, "
3205.63,"you can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly. "
3210.03,"And unfortunately, because these hair cells "
3213.21,"that we talked about earlier, "
3214.17,"our central nervous system neurons, they do not regenerate, "
3217.14,they do not come back. 
3219.03,"Now along the lines of hearing loss, "
3223.02,I should just say that the best way 
3225.22,"to blow out your hearing for good, "
3227.22,to eliminate your hearing is to have very loud sounds 
3231.9,super imposed on a loud environment. 
3234.89,So loud environments can cause hearing loss over time. 
3237.43,"So if you work at a construction site, clanging really loud, "
3240.33,"or if you work the sound board in a club or something, "
3243.73,you are headed towards hearing loss 
3245.76,unless you protect your hearing 
3247.63,with earplugs and headphones. 
3249.698,"Nowadays, some of the ear plugs are very low profile, "
3252.84,meaning you can't see them. 
3253.89,"So that's kind of nice, so you're not like the, "
3256.16,"when I was younger, like you didn't want to be the dork "
3257.99,"to go to the concert with the earplugs, "
3259.41,but it turns out those dorks were smarter 
3260.98,"than everybody else, because they're not the ones "
3263.24,who are craning their neck to try and hear trivial things 
3267.97,at the age of 
30,or so 'cause they blew out their hearing. 
3272.49,So if you are working in a loud environment 
3275.38,"or you expose yourselves to a loud environment, "
3278.69,you really want to avoid big inflections 
3282.02,in sound above that. 
3283.4,"So loud environment plus fireworks, "
3287.24,"loud environment plus gunshot, "
3289.19,"loud environments plus very high-frequency intense sound, "
3293.137,"that's what we call the two-hit model, "
3296.626,"this is also true for concussion, "
3297.84,that you can take a stimulus that normally 
3300.49,"would be below the threshold of injury, "
3302.08,"you add another stimulus at the same time, "
3305.18,that would be below the threshold of injury. 
3306.84,"And then, suddenly, you killed the neurons. "
3308.84,"So I don't want to make people paranoid, "
3310.61,but you do want to protect your hearing. 
3311.88,It's no fun to lose your hearing. 
3313.64,If you're going to use headphones and you feel 
3315.76,"like you want to crank it up all the way, "
3317.1,just remember that the more that you can get 
3320.78,"out of a lower volume, meaning the longer "
3322.83,"that you can go listening to things at lower volume, "
3325.69,the longer you'll be able to hear that music or that thing. 
3330.18,"So again, I'm not the hearing cop. "
3333.88,"That's not my job, but as somebody who's lost "
3336.79,"some of his high-frequency hearing, "
3338.7,I can tell you it's not a pleasure. 
3342.067,The old argument that it helps you not have to hear 
3345.123,"or listen to people that you don't want to listen to, "
3347.32,that does it doesn't really work. 
3348.38,They just send you text messages instead. 
3350.42,So what about white noise and hearing loss in development? 
3354.0,I know a lot of people with children 
3355.38,have these noise machines like sound waves 
3358.68,"and things like that, that help the kids sleep. "
3361.0,"And look, I think kids getting good sleep "
3363.67,and parents getting good sleep is vital 
3365.53,to physical and mental health and family health. 
3368.99,So I certainly sympathize with those needs. 
3373.93,"However, there are data that indicate "
3377.04,that white noise during development 
3379.82,can be detrimental to the auditory system. 
3382.44,I don't want to frighten any parents 
3383.74,"if you played white noise to your kids, "
3385.53,this doesn't mean that their auditory system 
3387.09,or their speech patterns are going to be disrupted 
3389.79,or that their interpretation of speech 
3391.15,is going to be disrupted forever. 
3392.93,"But there are data published in the journal, Science, "
3397.077,"and Science being one of the three, APEX Journal, "
3399.61,"Science, Nature, Cell, the most stringent journals, "
3403.4,"data published in the journal, Science, some years ago, "
3406.21,"actually by a scientist who I know quite well, "
3408.33,"his name is Edward Chang, he's a medical doctor now, "
3410.86,"he's a neurosurgeon, he's actually "
3412.27,the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF 
3415.14,"and he runs a laboratory where they study auditory learning, "
3418.87,"neuroplasticity, et cetera, he and his mentor at the time, "
3423.12,Mike Merzenich published a paper showing 
3426.19,that if young animals and this was in animal models 
3430.49,"were exposed to white noise, so [shushing] "
3435.02,"the very type of noise that I'm saying as a older person, "
3438.726,"and when I say older, I mean, somebody who's "
3440.98,"in their late teens, early "
20s,and older 
3443.14,could benefit from listening to that at a low level 
3445.93,"in the background for sake of learning, "
3448.202,"well, they exposed very young animals to this white noise, "
3451.642,it actually disrupted the maps of the auditory world 
3456.63,within the brain. 
3457.463,"And we haven't talked about these maps yet, "
3459.28,but I want to take a moment and talk about them 
3460.71,and explain this effect and what it might mean for you 
3464.05,if you have kids or if you were exposed 
3465.58,to a lot of white noise early on. 
3467.66,"So auditory information goes up into our cortex, into these, "
3473.309,"essentially, the outside portion of our brain "
3475.79,that's responsible for all our higher level cognition 
3479.55,"and our planning, our decision-making, et cetera, "
3481.84,"creativity and up there, "
3484.72,we have what are called tonotopic maps. 
3486.97,What's a tonotopic map? 
3488.43,"Well, remember the cochlea, how it's coiled "
3490.77,"and at one end, it responds to high frequencies "
3492.517,"and the other end, it responds to low frequencies? "
3495.77,"Like a piano, the keys sound different "
3497.78,as you extend down and up the piano keys. 
3501.0,And it's organized in a very systematic way. 
3503.72,It's not all intermixed high frequencies 
3505.264,and low frequencies. 
3506.3,It's organized in a very systematic way 
3509.07,from one end to the other. 
3510.73,"Your visual system is in, what's called a retinotopic map. "
3513.66,"So neighboring points in space off to my right, "
3516.88,like my two fingers off to my right 
3518.94,are mapped to neighboring points in space in my brain. 
3523.03,And that space right in front of me 
3525.44,"is mapped to a different location in my brain, "
3527.2,"but it's systematic, it's regular. "
3528.98,It's not random. It's not salt and pepper. 
3531.08,It goes from high to low or from right to center to left. 
3535.0,"In the auditory system, "
3536.11,"we have what are called tonotopic maps, "
3538.5,"where frequency, high frequency to low frequency "
3542.36,and everything in between is organized 
3544.27,in a very systematic way. 
3546.37,Now our experience of life from the time 
3548.95,we're a baby until the time that we die is not systematic. 
3552.68,We don't hear low frequencies at one part of the room 
3554.846,or at one part of the day and high frequencies 
3556.81,"is another part of the room and other part of the day, "
3558.87,they're all intermixed. 
3560.42,"But if you remember, the cochlea separates them out. "
3563.52,Just like a prism of light separates out 
3565.58,"the different wavelengths of light, "
3566.78,the cochlea separates out the different frequencies. 
3570.02,And the developing brain takes 
3572.77,those separated out frequencies and learns this relationship 
3577.04,"between itself, meaning the child and the outside world. "
3583.46,"White noise, essentially contains no tonotopic information. "
3588.61,The frequencies are all intermixed. 
3591.3,It's just noise. 
3592.87,"Whereas when I speak, my voice has, "
3595.45,"now I'm getting technical, but it has what's called "
3597.41,"a certain envelope, meaning it has some low frequencies "
3600.14,and some slightly higher frequency. 
3600.973,"Like I might a voice higher, "
3602.8,although I'm not very good at that. 
3604.09,"My voice starts to crack and I can make my voice lower, "
3607.22,although not as low as Costello's snore. 
3608.9,"So it has an envelope, it has a container. "
3612.32,White noise has no container. 
3614.04,"It's like all the colors of the rainbow spread out together, "
3617.44,which is actually what you get when you get white light 
3619.9,white noise is analogous to white light. 
3623.44,So one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise 
3629.64,during development for long periods of time can be 
3631.9,detrimental to the development of the auditory system 
3634.41,is that these tonotopic maps don't form normally; 
3637.18,"at least, they don't in experimental animals. "
3639.07,"Now, the reason I'm raising this "
3641.9,"is that many people I know, in particular, "
3643.86,"friends who have small children, they say, "
3646.367,"""I want to use a white noise machine while I sleep. "
3652.01,"But is it okay for my baby to use a white noise machine?"" "
3656.21,"And I consulted with various people, scientists about this. "
3659.78,"And they said, ""Well, the baby is also hearing "
3663.32,the parent's voices and is hearing music 
3665.141,and it's hearing the dog bark. 
3666.53,"So it's not the only thing they're hearing."" "
3668.35,"However, every single person that I consulted with said, "
3672.737,"""But there's neuroplasticity during sleep. "
3675.85,That's when the kid is sleeping. 
3677.7,And I don't know that you'd want to expose a child 
3680.51,"to white noise the entire night, "
3682.6,"because it might degrade that tonotopic map."" "
3686.15,It might not destroy it. 
3687.64,"It might not eliminate it, "
3688.91,"but it could make it a little less clear, "
3692.04,like taking the keys on the piano 
3694.627,"and taping a few of them together, right? "
3697.4,So you still got the highs and lows in the appropriate order 
3699.98,and everything in between. 
3701.11,"But when you take the keys together, "
3702.75,you don't get the same fidelity. 
3704.36,You don't get the same precision of the noise 
3707.95,that comes out of that piano. 
3709.926,"So, again, I don't want to scare anybody, "
3712.96,but I would say if you are in a position 
3714.63,to make the choice of either using white noise 
3717.63,"or something similar, pink noise is just a variation. "
3720.31,"It's got a little bit more of a certain frequency, "
3722.3,just like pink light has a little bit more 
3724.22,of a certain wavelength than white light. 
3727.22,If you are in a position to make choices 
3731.06,"about things, to put in a young, "
3733.89,"especially very young child's sleeping environment, "
3736.43,white noise might be something to consider avoiding. 
3739.72,"Again, I'm not telling you what to do, "
3741.24,but it's something to perhaps consider avoiding. 
3743.77,I don't think most pediatricians 
3745.43,"are going to be aware of these data, "
3747.34,but if you talk to any auditory physiologists 
3750.25,or an audiologist or somebody 
3751.99,"who studies auditory development, "
3754.33,I'm fairly certain that they would have opinions about that. 
3757.24,"Now, whether or not their opinions agree with mine "
3759.48,and these folks that I consulted with or not 
3761.87,is a separate matter. 
3762.703,"I don't know, cause I don't know them, "
3765.0,but it's something that I felt was important enough 
3767.32,"to cue you to, especially since I've highlighted, "
3771.49,"excuse me, the opposite effect is true in adulthood. "
3774.11,"Once your auditory system has formed, "
3776.5,"once it's established these tonotopic maps, "
3778.68,then the presence of background white noise 
3781.2,should not be a problem at all. 
3782.76,"In fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all "
3785.28,because you're also not attending to it. 
3787.33,The idea is that it's playing at a low enough volume 
3789.5,that you forget it in the background 
3791.12,and that it's supporting learning 
3792.68,by bringing your brain into a heightened state of alertness 
3795.23,"and, especially, this heightened state of dopamine, "
3797.97,"dopaminergic activation of the brain, "
3799.83,which will make it easier to learn faster 
3802.39,and easier to learn the information. 
3804.72,So now I want to talk about auditory learning 
3807.38,and actually how you can get better 
3809.03,"at learning information that you hear, "
3810.98,not just information that you see on a page 
3813.89,or motor skill learning. 
3815.96,There are a lot of reasons to want to do this. 
3817.59,"A lot of classroom teaching, whether or not it's by Zoom "
3820.27,or in-person is auditory in nature. 
3822.99,Not everything is necessarily written down for us. 
3827.12,It's also good to get better at listening or so I'm told. 
3832.26,So there's a phenomenon called the cocktail party effect. 
3835.99,"Now, even if you've never been to a cocktail party, "
3838.1,you've experienced and participated 
3840.451,in what's called the cocktail party effect. 
3842.93,The cocktail party effect is where you are 
3844.84,"in an environment that's rich with sound, "
3847.13,"many sound waves coming from many different sources, "
3849.78,"many different things, "
3850.613,"so in a city, in a classroom, "
3853.26,"in a car that contains people having various conversations, "
3857.53,you somehow need to be able to attend to specific components 
3862.07,"of those sound waves, meaning you need "
3863.45,to hear certain people and not others. 
3865.67,The reason it's called the cocktail party effect 
3867.97,is that you and meaning your brain 
3871.195,are exquisitely good at creating 
3875.59,"a cone of auditory attention, "
3877.66,a narrow band of attention with which you can extract 
3880.98,the information you care about 
3882.81,and wipe away or erase all the rest. 
3887.21,"Now this takes work, it takes attention. "
3890.4,One of the reasons why you might come home from 
3893.4,"a loud gathering, maybe a stadium, a sports event "
3896.0,"or a cocktail party, for that matter, "
3897.84,and feel just exhausted is because if you were listening 
3900.6,to conversations there or trying to listen 
3902.52,to those conversations while watching the game 
3904.46,"and people moving past you and hearing all this noise, "
3908.03,"clinking of glasses, et cetera, "
3910.56,it takes attentional effort and the brain uses up 
3914.48,"a lot of energy just at rest, "
3917.56,but it uses up even more energy 
3919.97,"when you are paying strong attention to something, "
3922.2,"literally caloric energy burning up things like glucose, "
3925.08,"et cetera, even if you're ketogenic, it's burning up energy. "
3928.69,So the cocktail party effect has been studied extensively 
3932.7,in the field of neuroscience and we now know 
3934.87,"at a mechanistic level, how one accomplishes "
3938.1,"this feat of attending to certain sounds, "
3940.78,despite the fact that we are being bombarded 
3943.51,with all sorts of other sounds. 
3945.41,So there are a couple ways that we do this. 
3946.9,"First of all, much as with our visual system, "
3952.0,"we can expand or contract our visual field of view, "
3957.79,"so we can go from panoramic vision, "
3959.61,"see the entire scene that we are in by dilating our gaze, "
3963.36,talked a lot about this on this podcast and elsewhere. 
3965.9,"We can, for instance, keep our head and eyes stationary "
3968.56,"or mostly stationary, you don't have to be rigid about it, "
3970.61,and you can expand your field of view 
3972.01,"so you can see the walls and ceiling and floor, "
3974.24,"can see yourself in the environment, that's panoramic view. "
3976.413,It's what you would accomplish without having to try at all 
3978.92,"if you went to a horizon, for instance, "
3981.91,"or we can contract our field of view, "
3983.55,"I can bring my focus to a particular location, "
3986.423,"what we call a vergence point, directly in front of me. "
3988.61,Now I'm pointing at the camera directly in front of me. 
3991.74,"We can do that, we can expand and contract "
3993.24,our visual field of view. 
3994.26,"Well, we can expand and contract our auditory field of view, "
4000.24,"so to speak, our auditory window. "
4003.14,You can try this next time you are in an environment 
4006.43,"that's rich with noise, meaning lots of different sounds. "
4009.5,You can just tune out all the noise to a background chatter. 
4014.76,You try not focus on any one particular sound 
4019.31,and you get the background chatter of noise. 
4022.89,And you'll find that it's actually very relaxing 
4025.07,in comparison to trying to listen to somebody 
4026.89,at a cocktail party or shouting back and forth. 
4028.61,"Now, if you're very, very interested in that person, "
4030.61,"or getting to know them better or what they're telling you, "
4033.97,"or some combination of those things, "
4035.47,then you'll be very motivated to do it 
4037.47,"but nonetheless, it requires energy "
4039.67,and effort and attention. 
4042.31,How do we do this? 
4043.3,"Well, it's actually quite simple "
4047.3,"or, at least, it's simple, in essence, "
4049.65,although the underlying mechanisms are complex. 
4052.78,"Here, I have to credit the laboratory "
4055.93,"of a guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R, "
4059.61,up at the University of Oregon who essentially 
4063.5,figured out that we are able to accomplish 
4065.93,this extraction of particular sounds. 
4068.5,We can really hear one person or a small number of people 
4072.18,amidst a huge background of chatter 
4074.87,"because we pay attention to the onset of words, "
4080.01,but also to the offset of words. 
4083.02,"Now, the way to visualize this is if the background noise "
4087.07,"is just like a bunch of waves of noise, "
4088.95,"it's literally just sound waves coming every frequency, "
4091.37,"low frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together. "
4093.75,"If you've got a game, people are shouting, "
4095.24,"people are talking on their phone, "
4097.12,"there's the crack of the ball, "
4098.27,"if somebody actually manages to hit the ball, "
4102.84,"the announcer, et cetera, "
4104.4,"but whatever we were paying attention to, "
4107.34,"we set up a cone of auditory attention, "
4109.862,"a tunnel of auditory attention, where we are listening "
4113.47,"although we don't realize it, we are listening "
4114.96,for the onset and the offset of those words. 
4119.11,Now this is powerful for a couple of reasons. 
4121.71,"First of all, it's a call to arms, so to speak, "
4127.38,to disengage your auditory system 
4130.55,when you don't need to focus your attention 
4132.45,on something particular. 
4133.87,"So if you are somebody, you're coming home from work, "
4136.05,you've had a very long day and you're trying to make out 
4140.23,"a particular conversation on background noise, "
4143.44,"you might consider just not having that conversation, "
4146.42,"just letting your auditory landscape be very broad, "
4150.46,almost like panoramic vision. 
4153.09,"If you're trying to learn how to extract sound information, "
4157.1,"it could be notes of music, it could be scales of music, "
4162.38,"it could be words spoken by somebody else, "
4164.83,maybe somebody is telling you what you need to say 
4167.53,for a particular speech or the information 
4170.29,"that you need to learn for a particular topic, "
4172.6,"and they're telling it to you, "
4174.94,deliberately paying attention both to the onset 
4177.652,and to the offset of those words can be beneficial 
4181.35,because it is exactly the way that the auditory system likes 
4185.32,to bring in information. 
4187.26,So one of the more common phenomenon 
4190.5,that I think we all experience is you go to a party 
4193.701,"or you meet somebody new and you say hi, "
4196.21,"I would say, ""Hi, I'm Andrew."" "
4197.4,"And they'd say, ""Hi, I'm Jeff,"" for instance. "
4199.797,"""Great to meet you."" "
4200.63,"And then a minute later, I can't remember the guy's name. "
4203.96,"Now, is it because I don't care what his name is? "
4205.69,"No, somehow the presence "
4208.13,of other auditory information interfered. 
4210.29,It's not that my mind was necessarily someplace else. 
4212.78,It's that the signal-to-noise as we say wasn't high enough. 
4217.54,"Somehow the way he said it or the way it landed on my ears, "
4222.49,"which is really all that matters, "
4224.236,"when it comes down to learning, is such that "
4228.68,it just didn't achieve high enough signal-to-noise. 
4231.65,The noise was too high or the signal was too low 
4233.99,or some combination of those. 
4235.88,"So the next time you ask somebody's name, "
4237.49,remember listen to the onset of what they say 
4240.12,and the offset. 
4240.953,So it would be paying attention to the j in Jeff 
4243.99,"and it would be paying attention to that in f in F, "
4246.98,"in Jeff, excuse me. "
4249.56,"And chances are, you'll be able to remember that name. "
4253.16,"Now, I don't know if people who are super learners "
4256.44,of names do this naturally or not. 
4259.41,I don't have access to their brains. 
4261.03,I don't think they're going to give me access 
4262.21,to their brains either. 
4263.53,But it's a very interesting way to take the natural biology 
4267.1,of auditory attention and learning and apply it to scenarios 
4270.16,where you're trying to remember either people's names 
4272.645,or specific information. 
4274.57,"Now, I do acknowledge that trying to learn every word "
4277.63,in a sentence by paying attention 
4279.53,to its onset and offset could actually be disruptive 
4283.05,to the learning process. 
4284.83,"So this would be more for specific attention, "
4287.38,"like you're asking directions in a city and somebody says, "
4289.56,"okay, you say you're lost and they say, okay, "
4292.27,"you're going to go two blocks down, "
4294.58,you're going to turn left. 
4295.87,And then you're going to see a landmark on your right. 
4297.86,And then you're going to go in the third door on your left. 
4302.9,"That's a lot of information, at least, for me. "
4305.45,So the way you would want to listen to that 
4307.82,is you're going to go down the road. 
4310.31,"See, I already forgot. "
4312.334,You're going to go left and you're just going to program 
4314.87,"and instead of just hearing the word left, "
4316.24,you're going to think the L at the front of left and the T. 
4319.92,"You're going to left, okay. "
4323.05,So you're coding in specific words. 
4325.09,And what this does is this hijacks 
4327.81,these naturally-occurring attention mechanisms 
4330.11,that the auditory system likes to use. 
4332.55,"So a little bit of data that for auditory encoding, "
4335.5,this kind of thing can be beneficial. 
4337.69,There are a lot of data that attention 
4340.61,for auditory coding is beneficial. 
4343.7,There are a little bit of data showing 
4346.7,"that deliberately encoding auditory information this way, "
4350.02,meaning trying to learn auditory information this way 
4352.8,can be beneficial or can accelerate learning. 
4355.59,"And some of these features of what I'm describing here, "
4359.03,map onto some of the work that of Mike Merzenich and others 
4363.63,that have been designed to try and overcome things 
4366.55,like stutter and to treat various forms 
4369.8,of auditory learning disorders. 
4372.22,"But more importantly, and perhaps more powerful "
4376.64,is the work of Mike Merzenich that was done 
4379.56,"with his then graduate student, Gregg Recanzone "
4382.86,"that showed that, using the attentional system, "
4386.74,we can actually learn much faster 
4389.4,and we can actually activate neuroplasticity 
4392.71,"in the adult brain, something that's very challenging to do. "
4396.04,And that the auditory system is one of the main ways 
4399.5,in which we can access neuroplasticity more broadly. 
4402.62,So I just want to take a couple of minutes 
4404.16,"and describe the work of Recanzone and Merzenich, "
4406.39,because it's absolutely fantastic and fascinating. 
4410.55,What they did is they had subjects try 
4414.36,"to learn auditory information, "
4416.98,except that they told them to pay attention 
4420.06,to particular frequencies. 
4422.44,So now you know what frequencies are 
4423.79,"so, essentially, high-pitched sounds or low-pitched sounds. "
4428.66,What they found was just passively listening 
4432.34,to a bunch of stuff does not allow the brain to change 
4436.22,and for that stuff to be remembered at all. 
4438.96,That's not a surprise. 
4439.97,We've all experienced the phenomenon 
4442.66,of having someone talk and we see their mouth moving 
4444.66,"and we're like, yeah, this is really important, "
4445.869,this is really important. 
4446.71,We're listening. We're trying to listen. 
4448.04,And then they walk away and we think 
4449.32,I didn't get any of that. 
4451.37,"And you wonder whether or not it was them, "
4453.38,maybe this is happening to you right now. 
4455.08,"You wonder whether or not it was you, "
4457.75,you wonder whether or not you have trouble with learning 
4459.77,or you have attention deficit. 
4461.27,It could be any number of different things. 
4463.21,But what Recanzone and Merzenich discovered 
4465.3,was that if you instruct subjects to listen 
4468.52,"for particular cues within speech, or within sounds, "
4472.81,"that not only can you learn those things more quickly, "
4475.78,but that you can remap these tonotopic maps in the cortex 
4482.11,that I referred to earlier. 
4483.17,"You actually get changes in the neural architecture, "
4485.47,"the neural circuitry in the brain, "
4487.02,"and this can occur not only very rapidly, "
4490.68,"but they can occur in the adult brain, "
4493.13,which prior to their work was not thought 
4495.73,to be amenable to change. 
4497.38,It was long thought that neuroplasticity 
4499.45,"could only occur in the developing brain, "
4501.26,but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich 
4503.23,in the auditory system actually was some of the first 
4506.82,that really opened up everybody's eyes and ears 
4510.75,to the idea that the brain can change in adulthood. 
4514.1,So here's how this sort of process would work 
4516.127,and how you might apply it. 
4518.37,"If you are trying to learn music, "
4520.58,or you're trying to learn information 
4523.56,"that you're going to then recite, "
4526.62,you can decide to highlight certain words 
4529.781,or certain frequencies of sound 
4533.67,"or certain scales or certain keys on the piano, "
4536.42,and to only focus on those for certain learning bouts. 
4540.27,"So I'll give an example that's real time for me, "
4544.35,meaning it's happening right now. 
4547.89,"I know generally what I want to say when I arrive here, "
4551.37,I even know specifically certain things 
4553.32,"that I want to make sure get across to you, "
4556.42,but I don't think about every single word 
4558.94,that I'm going to say and the precise order 
4561.5,in which I'm going to say those things. 
4563.33,That would be actually very disruptive 
4565.24,because it wouldn't match my normal patterns of speech 
4567.54,and you'd probably think I was sounding rather robotic 
4570.158,if I were to do that. 
4573.24,So one way that we can remember information 
4575.56,"is as we write out, for instance, "
4577.47,"something that we want to say, "
4579.19,"we can highlight particular words, we can underline those. "
4583.15,If we're listening to somebody 
4585.56,"and they're telling us information, "
4588.81,we can decide just to highlight particular words 
4591.78,that they said to us and write those down. 
4594.43,"Now, of course, we're listening to all the information, "
4597.02,but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich 
4599.9,and the work of others in addition to his former student 
4604.35,"or former post-doc, I don't know which, "
4606.66,Michael Kilgard who's now got his own lab down in Texas 
4609.58,or others have shown that the cuing of attention 
4612.48,"to particular features of speech, "
4614.73,"particular components of speech, "
4617.06,the way in which it increases our level of attention overall 
4620.46,allows us to capture more of the information overall. 
4624.14,And so I don't want this to be abstract at all. 
4626.01,"What this means is when you're listening, "
4627.9,you don't have to listen to every word. 
4630.43,You're already listening to every word. 
4632.12,All the information is coming in through your ears. 
4634.41,What you're trying to extract is particular things 
4638.78,or themes within the content. 
4640.77,So maybe you decide if you're listening to me 
4642.62,"that you're only going to listen to the word tools, "
4646.21,or you're only going to listen 
4647.25,"to when my voice goes above background, "
4649.84,you get to decide what you decide to listen to or not. 
4652.72,And what you decide to focus on isn't necessarily 
4656.14,as important as the fact that you're focusing. 
4659.28,So I hope that's clear. 
4660.57,The auditory system does this all the time 
4662.84,with the cocktail party effect. 
4664.04,What I'm talking about is exporting certain elements 
4666.75,"of the mechanisms of the cocktail party effect, "
4669.41,paying attention to the onset and offset of words 
4671.85,"or particular notes within music or particular scales, "
4675.55,or you can make it even broader and particular motifs 
4679.56,of music or particular sentences of words 
4682.31,or particular phrases. 
4683.55,"And in doing that, you extract more "
4685.91,"of the information overall, "
4688.32,even though you're not paying attention 
4689.53,to all the information at once. 
4691.81,"Now, I'd like to talk about a phenomenon "
4693.46,"that you've all experienced before, which is called Doppler. "
4697.95,So the Doppler effect is the way that we experience sound 
4704.34,when the thing that's making that sound is moving. 
4708.92,The simplest way to explain this is to translate the sound 
4712.52,into the visual world once again. 
4715.42,So if you've ever seen a duck or a goose sitting 
4719.8,"in a pond or a lake and it's bobbing up and down, "
4724.44,what you'll notice is that the ripples of water 
4726.62,that extend out from that duck or goose 
4729.4,are fairly regularly spaced in all directions. 
4732.09,And that's because that duck or goose is stationary. 
4734.76,"It's moving up and down, but it's not moving forward "
4736.81,or backward or to the side. 
4739.01,"Now, if that duck or goose were to swim forward "
4742.13,"by paddling its little webbed feet under the surface, "
4745.94,you would immediately notice that the ripples of water 
4749.12,that are close to and in front of that duck or goose 
4752.49,"would be closer together than the ones that trailed it, "
4755.52,that were behind. 
4756.95,And that is essentially what happens with sound as well. 
4760.767,"With the Doppler effect, we experience sounds "
4764.7,"that are closer to us at higher frequency, "
4766.93,"the ripples are closer together, "
4769.34,"and sounds that are further away at lower frequency, "
4772.73,especially when they're moving past us. 
4775.04,"So if you've ever, for instance, heard a siren "
4778.13,"in the distance, [humming] "
4787.81,"that's essentially my rendition of a siren, "
4790.44,"I don't know what ambulance or police or what, "
4792.89,"passing you on a street, that is the Doppler effect. "
4797.32,The Doppler effect is one of the main ways 
4799.96,that we make out the direction that things are arriving 
4804.63,from and their speeds and trajectories. 
4808.05,"And we get very good, from a very young age, "
4811.71,at discerning what direction things are arriving from 
4815.33,and the direction that they are going to pass us in. 
4819.35,And the Doppler effect has probably saved 
4820.85,"your life many, many times. "
4823.03,"In this way, you just don't realize it "
4824.57,because you'll step off the curb 
4825.637,or you're driving your car and you pull to the side 
4829.34,so that the ambulance or firetruck can go by 
4832.16,"because you heard that siren off in the distance, "
4837.09,and then you pull away from the curb 
4838.55,"and you get back on the road in part, "
4840.45,"because you don't see it any longer, "
4841.88,but also you don't hear any other sirens in the distance. 
4844.97,"Now, some animals such as bats are exquisitely good "
4849.04,at navigating their environments according to sound. 
4851.95,"Now, we've all heard that bats don't see. "
4855.35,That's actually not true. 
4856.4,"They actually have vision, "
4857.71,but they just rely more heavily on their auditory system. 
4860.38,And the way that bats navigate in the dark 
4863.54,and the way that bats navigate using sound 
4866.3,is through Doppler. 
4867.89,"Now, they don't simply listen to whether or not things "
4871.61,are coming at them or moving away from them 
4874.66,and pay attention to the Doppler like the siren example 
4877.33,I gave for you. 
4878.94,What they do is they generate their own sounds. 
4882.64,"So a bat, as it flies around is sending out clicks, "
4887.857,[Andrew clicks tongue] 
4889.13,I think that's my best bat sound or maybe it's 
4890.913,[Andrew clicks tongue] 
4892.37,"and they're clicking, they're actually propelling sound out "
4895.12,at a particular frequency that they know. 
4898.35,"Now, whether or not they're conscious of it, I don't know. "
4900.21,I've never asked them. 
4901.043,"And if I did ask them, I don't think they could answer. "
4902.307,"And if they could answer, they couldn't answer "
4903.91,in a language that I could understand. 
4905.86,"But the bat is essentially flying around, "
4908.16,"sending out sound waves, pinging its environment "
4911.35,with sound waves of a particular frequency 
4913.38,and then depending on the frequency of sound waves 
4915.84,"that come back, they know if they're getting closer "
4918.93,to an object or further away from it. 
4921.16,"So if they send out sounds at a frequency of, "
4924.77,"this was much slower than it would actually occur, "
4926.7,"but let's say one every half second, [whining] "
4930.75,and it's coming back even faster [roars] 
4933.81,then they know they're getting closer 
4935.76,because of the Doppler effect. 
4938.04,"And if it comes back more slowly, "
4940.28,they know that there's nothing in front of them. 
4942.31,So the bat is essentially navigating its world 
4945.88,by creating these auras of sound 
4949.42,that bounce back on to them 
4951.71,"from the various objects, trees, et cetera, "
4953.93,"buildings and people, it's kind of eerie to think about. "
4956.42,"But yes, they see you, they experience you with their sound, "
4959.92,they sense you and they're using Doppler to accomplish it. 
4964.46,Now I'd like to talk about ringing in the ears. 
4968.01,This is something that I get asked about a lot. 
4971.04,"And speaking of signal-to-noise, "
4973.38,"I don't know if I get asked about it a lot, "
4975.58,"because many people suffer from ringing in their ears, "
4978.95,or because the people who suffer from ringing 
4981.31,in their ears suffer so much 
4983.14,that they are more prone to ask. 
4985.51,"So it could be a sampling bias, I don't know, "
4988.33,but I've been asked enough times and some of the experiences 
4992.05,of discomfort that people have expressed 
4994.38,about having this ringing of the ears 
4997.34,really motivated me to go deep into this literature. 
5000.69,So the ringing of the ears that one experiences 
5004.18,"is called tinnitus, not ti-nahy-tus, but tinnitus. "
5009.8,And tinnitus can vary in intensity 
5012.75,"and it can vary according to stress levels, "
5016.25,it can vary across the lifespan or even time of day. 
5020.55,So it's very subject to background effects 
5023.41,and contextual effects. 
5025.84,So I think we all know that we should do our best 
5028.84,to maximize healthy sleep. 
5030.21,We did a number of episodes on that. 
5032.07,"Essentially, the first four episodes "
5033.82,of the Huberman Lab Podcast were all about sleep 
5035.66,and how to get better sleep. 
5038.2,We all know that we should try and limit our stress. 
5040.15,And we had an episode about stress 
5042.25,and ways to mitigate stress as well. 
5045.99,"However, there are people, it seems, "
5048.47,"that are suffering from tinnitus, "
5049.89,for which stress or lack of sleep 
5052.45,just can't explain the presence of the tinnitus. 
5055.93,Tinnitus can be caused by disruption 
5059.65,to these hair cells that we talked about earlier 
5061.61,or damage to the hair cells. 
5063.71,"So that's another reason why, "
5065.23,even if you have good hearing now 
5068.46,that you want to protect that hearing 
5070.09,and really avoid putting yourself 
5072.59,"into these two-hit environments, "
5074.71,"environments where there's a lot of background noise, "
5076.96,and then you add another really loud auditory stimulus. 
5080.99,"This also can happen at different times, I should mention. "
5083.57,If you go to a concert or you listen to loud music 
5086.91,"with your headphones and then you go to a concert, "
5089.66,"or you go into a very loud work environment, "
5092.17,the hair cells can still be vulnerable. 
5093.96,"And once those hair cells are knocked out, currently, "
5097.12,we don't have the technology to put them back. 
5098.84,"Although many groups, including some excellent groups "
5101.14,"at Stanford and elsewhere, too, of course, "
5103.985,are working on ways to replenish those hair cells 
5107.32,and restore hearing. 
5109.84,There are treatments for tinnitus 
5111.57,that involve taking certain substances. 
5117.39,There are medications for tinnitus. 
5119.93,"In the non-prescription landscape, "
5121.85,"which is typically what we discuss on this podcast, "
5124.32,"when we discuss taking anything, "
5127.66,"there are, essentially, four compounds "
5129.67,"for which there are quality peer-reviewed data, "
5132.62,"where there does not appear to be any overt commercial bias, "
5136.91,meaning that nothing's reported in the papers 
5139.1,as funding from a particular company 
5141.13,"and those are melatonin, Ginkgo bilboa, zinc and magnesium. "
5146.47,Now I've talked about melatonin before. 
5149.11,"I'm personally not a fan of melatonin as a sleep aid, "
5153.13,"but there are four studies, first one entitled: "
5157.22,"The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus, "
5160.48,"tinnitus, excuse me, and Sleep. "
5162.7,"Second one, Treatment of Central and Sensory Neural Tinnitus "
5165.8,with orally-administered melatonin. 
5167.67,"And then the title goes on much longer, "
5169.66,but it's a randomized study. 
5171.6,I'm not going to read out all these. 
5172.73,Melatonin: Can it Stop The ringing? 
5174.68,"which is an interesting article, double-blinded study, "
5177.73,and The Effects of Melatonin on Tinnitus. 
5181.05,Each one of these studies has anywhere from 
30,
5183.86,to more than 
100,"subjects, in one case "
102,subjects; 
5188.29,"both genders as they list them out, "
5191.01,"typically, it's listed as sex, not gender in studies "
5194.09,"so it should say both sexes, but nonetheless; "
5198.665,an age range anywhere from 
30,"years old, "
5202.62,all the way up to 
65,plus. 
5204.43,I didn't see any studies of people younger than 
30.,
5208.79,"All three focused on melatonin, not surprisingly, "
5212.98,"because of the titles, looking at a range "
5215.5,"of dosages anywhere from three milligrams per day, "
5218.65,"which is sort of typical of many supplements for melatonin, "
5222.32,still much higher than one would manufacture endogenously 
5226.48,"through your own pineal gland, "
5228.35,but three milligrams in these studies 
5232.34,for a duration of anywhere from 
30,days 
5235.37,"to much longer in some cases, six months. "
5239.27,And all four of these studies found modest 
5242.72,yet still statistically significant effects 
5245.623,"of taking melatonin by mouth, "
5248.24,so it's orally-administered melatonin 
5251.39,in reducing the severity of tinnitus. 
5256.33,"So that's compelling, at least to me. "
5258.376,It doesn't sound like a cure. 
5260.97,"And, of course, as always, I'm not a physician, "
5264.46,"I'm a scientist, so I don't prescribe anything. "
5266.52,"I only profess things, I report to you the science. "
5268.66,You have to decide if melatonin is right for you 
5271.1,if you have tinnitus. 
5273.14,"And certainly, I say that both to protect myself, "
5276.3,but also protect you. 
5277.59,You're responsible for your health and wellbeing. 
5280.04,And I'm not telling anyone to run out 
5282.38,"and start taking melatonin for tinnitus, "
5284.951,but it does seem that it can have some effects 
5287.35,in reducing its symptoms. 
5290.41,Ginkgo Boaboa is an interesting compound. 
5293.188,It's been prescribed for or recommended 
5296.56,"for many, many things, but there are a few studies, "
5301.9,"again, double-blinded studies lasting one to six months, "
5305.147,"one that has have an impressive number of subjects, "
5307.97,
978,subjects ranging from age 
18,all the way up to 
65,
5313.13,"so on and so forth that show not huge effects of Ginkgo, "
5320.49,"but as they quote, limited evidence suggests "
5323.25,"that if tinnitus is a side effect of something else, "
5327.22,"in particular, cognitive decline, "
5329.47,so age-related tinnitus might be helped by Ginkgo Boaboa. 
5336.84,"I won't go through all the details of the zinc studies, "
5339.01,but it seems that zinc supplementation 
5340.65,at higher levels than are typical 
5342.33,of most people's intakes of 
50,"milligrams per day, "
5345.32,do appear to be able to reduce subjective symptoms 
5347.5,of tinnitus in most of the people 
5350.0,that took the supplemented zinc. 
5351.75,There aren't a lot of studies on that. 
5353.9,So I could only find one double-blinded study. 
5356.84,"It lasted anywhere from one to six months, "
5358.75,
41,"subjects, both genders listed out again here, "
45,to 
"64,",
5363.43,and they saw a decrease in the severity of tinnitus symptoms 
5366.913,with 
50,milligrams of elemental zinc supplementation. 
5371.19,And then last but not least is the magnesium study. 
5374.37,"Again, only a single study. "
5376.41,It's a Phase II study looking 
5378.75,"at a fairly limited number of subjects, "
5381.03,so only 
19,subjects taking 
532,milligrams 
5385.16,of elemental magnesium. 
5386.5,"For those of you that take magnesium, "
5387.76,"there's magnesium and elemental magnesium, "
5389.6,"and it's always translated on the bottle, "
5392.32,but it was associated with a lessening of symptoms 
5394.8,related to tinnitus. 
5396.09,"So for you tinnitus sufferers out there, "
5399.77,"you may already be aware of this, "
5401.23,you may already be taking these things 
5403.386,"and had no positive effects, "
5406.31,"meaning they didn't help, maybe not. "
5408.47,"I hope that you'll, at least, consider these, "
5411.57,talk to your doctor about them. 
5413.16,I do realize that tinnitus is extremely disruptive. 
5416.3,"I can't say I empathize because I don't, "
5420.09,"from a place of experience, that is, "
5421.54,"because I don't have tinnitus, "
5422.69,"but for those of you that don't include myself, "
5424.67,you can imagine that hearing sounds of things 
5427.62,that aren't there and the ringing in one's ears 
5429.51,can be very disruptive and I think would be very disruptive 
5433.03,and explains why people with tinnitus reach out so often 
5436.34,with questions about how to alleviate that. 
5438.41,And I hope this information was useful to you. 
5440.87,"I'd like to now talk about balance and our sense of balance, "
5444.84,"which is controlled by, believe it or not, "
5448.08,"our ears and things in our ears, "
5451.0,as well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord. 
5455.59,"But before I do that, I want to ask you another question "
5458.19,"or I would rather, I'd like to ask you to ask yourself "
5461.85,"a question and answer it, which is how big are your ears. "
5467.26,It turns out that the ears grow our entire life. 
5471.98,"In the early stage of our life, they grow more slowly. "
5475.43,"And then as we age, they grow more quickly. "
5479.15,You may have noticed if you have family members 
5482.14,who are well into their 
70s,and 
"80s,",
5485.038,"and if you're fortunate, into their "
90s,
5488.847,and maybe even 
"100s,",is that the ears 
5492.2,"of some of these individuals get very, very big, "
5495.2,relative to their previous ear sizes. 
5498.586,So it turns out that biological age 
5501.47,can actually be measured according to ear size. 
5506.21,"Now you have to take a few measurements but there's, "
5508.35,"believe it or not, there is a formula "
5510.43,"in the scientific literature, "
5513.91,"if you know your ear circumference, "
5516.6,"so the distance around your ear, ears, plural, "
5521.34,"presumably you have two, most people do, "
5524.44,"in millimeters, so you're going to take the circumference "
5527.51,of your ears in millimeters. 
5528.47,How would you do this? 
5530.17,How would you do this? 
5531.07,"Maybe you take a string and you put it around your ear, "
5534.34,and then you measure the string. 
5535.45,That's probably going to be easier than marching around 
5538.11,your ear or somebody else's ear with a ruler 
5540.42,and measuring in millimeters. 
5541.61,"So what's your ear circumference, on the outside, "
5544.81,don't go in on the divot or anything. 
5546.41,You're just going around as if you're going to trace 
5548.07,"the closest fitting oval, "
5550.91,"assuming your ears are oval, closest fitting oval "
5553.91,that matches your ear circumference. 
5557.02,"Take that number in millimeters, subtract from it... "
5560.95,"Oh, excuse me, I should do this correctly. "
5563.27,"Do that for both ears, add them together, "
5566.08,"add those numbers together, divide by two, "
5567.89,"get the average for your two ears, "
5570.16,"get your average ear circumference, "
5571.85,"of course, your two ears. "
5573.56,"Then take that number in millimeters, "
5575.96,subtract 
88.1,"and then whatever value that is, "
5581.44,multiply it times 
1.96,
5584.4,and that will tell you your biological age. 
5587.4,Now why in the world would this be accurate? 
5592.0,"As we age, there are changes in number "
5594.13,of different biological pathways. 
5597.66,One of those pathways is the pathways related 
5599.73,to collagen synthesis. 
5601.78,"So not only are our ears growing, "
5604.57,"but our noses are growing too, "
5606.717,and my nose seems to be growing a lot. 
5608.93,"But then again, I did sports where I would get "
5610.46,"my nose broken, something I don't recommend. "
5612.51,"As I always point out, you don't get "
5613.46,"a nose like mine doing yoga, but nonetheless, "
5617.27,my nose is still growing and my ears are still growing. 
5619.59,"And I suspect as I get older, "
5621.22,if I have the good fortune of living into my 
80s,and 
"90s,",
5625.03,my ears are going to continue to grow. 
5627.34,A comparison between chronological age and biological age 
5630.24,is something that's a really deep interest these days 
5632.38,in the work of David Sinclair 
5634.28,at Harvard Medical School and others. 
5637.53,So called Horvath clocks that people have developed 
5641.03,have tapped into how the epigenome and the genome 
5643.908,can give us some insight into our biological age 
5647.85,and how that compares to our chronological age. 
5649.83,"Most of us know our chronological age, "
5652.02,because we know when we were born 
5653.89,and we know where we are relative to that now. 
5656.95,"But you can start to make a little chart, "
5661.09,"if you like, about your rates of ear growth. "
5663.89,Your rates of ear growth actually correlate pretty well 
5666.38,with your rates of biological progression 
5669.67,through this thing that we call life. 
5672.49,"So it's not something that we think about too often, "
5674.72,"but just like our DNA and our epigenome, "
5678.83,and some other markers of metabolic health 
5681.48,"and hormone health relate to our age, "
5683.97,so does our collagen synthesis. 
5686.04,And one of the places that shows up the most 
5687.738,"is in these two little goodies on the sides of our heads, "
5690.28,which are our ears. 
5691.76,"So even though it's a little bit of a bizarre metric, "
5694.91,it makes perfect sense in the biological context. 
5697.69,So let's talk about balance 
5699.22,and how to get better at balancing. 
5701.7,The reason why we're talking about balance 
5703.33,and how to get better at balancing 
5705.0,in the episode about hearing is that all the goodies 
5708.93,that are going to allow you to do that are in your ears. 
5713.83,"They're also in your brain, but they're mostly in your ears. "
5717.73,"So as you recall from the beginning of this episode, "
5719.96,"you have two cochlea, cochleas, "
5722.8,that are one on each side of your head. 
5725.63,And that's a little spiral snail-shaped thing 
5727.81,that converts sound waves into electrical signals 
5730.68,that the rest of your brain can understand. 
5733.39,"Right next to those, "
5734.71,you have what are called semicircular canals. 
5738.94,The semicircular canals can be best visualized 
5741.46,as thinking about three hula hoops with marbles in them. 
5745.38,So imagine that you have a hula hoop 
5748.36,"and it's not filled with marbles all the way around, "
5751.42,it's just got some marbles down there at the base. 
5754.91,"So if you were to move that hula hoop around, "
5757.31,"the marbles would move around, [shushing]. "
5760.89,You've got three of those and each one of those hula hoops 
5763.3,has these marbles that can move around. 
5766.75,One of those hula hoops is positioned vertically 
5771.47,with respect to gravity. 
5772.8,So it's basically parallel to your nose. 
5775.57,"It sits like this, if you're watching on a video, "
5777.57,but basically it's upright. 
5779.2,Another one of those hula hoops is basically 
5782.935,at a 
90-degree,angle to your nose. 
5787.36,It's basically parallel to the floor 
5789.77,"if you're standing up right now, if you're seated. "
5793.52,"And the other one, it's kind of tilted "
5797.25,about 
45,degrees in between those. 
5800.17,Now why is the system there? 
5802.9,"Well, those marbles within each one of those hula hoops "
5805.31,"can move around, but they'll only move around "
5809.76,"if your head moves in a particular way, "
5811.72,and there are three planes or three ways 
5814.56,that your head can move. 
5816.34,Your head can move up and down like I'm nodding right now. 
5820.11,"So that's called pitch, "
5821.66,it's pitching forward or pitching back. 
5825.74,"So it's a nod, up and down, "
5828.52,"or I can shake my head no, side to side. "
5831.57,That's called a yaw. 
5832.94,"You pilots will be very familiar with this, yaw. "
5836.04,"Not yawn, yaw. "
5838.28,"And then there's roll, tilting the head from side to side, "
5842.26,the way that a cute puppy might look at you 
5844.83,from side to side or that if somebody 
5847.36,"doesn't really understand or believe what you're saying, "
5850.7,"they might tilt their head, very common phenomenon. "
5854.26,"I mean, nobody does that to me, "
5855.55,but they do that to each other. 
5857.69,"So pitch, yaw and roll are the movements of the head "
5861.96,"in each of the three major planes of motion, as we say. "
5865.38,And each one of those causes those marbles 
5869.01,to move in one or two of the various hula hoops. 
5874.53,"So if I move my head up and down when I nod, "
5877.25,"one of those hula hoops, literally, right now, "
5880.07,the marbles are moving back and forth. 
5881.42,"They aren't actually marbles by the way, "
5883.22,"these are little, kind of like little stones, basically, "
5888.33,little calcium-like deposits 
5891.02,"and when they roll back and forth, "
5893.82,"they deflect little hairs, "
5896.79,little hair cells that aren't like the hair cells 
5898.93,that we use for measuring sound waves. 
5901.04,"They're not too different, but they are different from them, "
5904.6,"not like the hairs on our heads, "
5907.07,but they're basically rolling past 
5909.3,these little hair cells and causing them to deflect 
5912.6,"and when they deflect downward, the neurons, "
5915.765,"because hair cells are neurons, "
5917.34,send information up to the brain. 
5920.73,"So if I move my head like this, "
5922.52,there's a physical movement of these little stones 
5925.57,"in this hula hoop as I'm referring to it, "
5928.43,"but they deflect these hairs, send those hairs, "
5931.74,"which are neurons, those hair cells, "
5933.46,send information off to the brain. 
5934.93,"If I move my head from side to side, "
5936.65,different little stones move. 
5938.63,"If I roll my head, different stones move. "
5940.89,This is an exquisite system that exists in all animals 
5944.92,that have a jaw. 
5947.55,"So any fish that has a jaw has this system, "
5950.61,"a puppy has the system, "
5952.3,"any animal that has a jaw has this so-called balance system, "
5956.12,which we call the vestibular system. 
5958.29,One of the more important things to know 
5960.12,"about the vestibular, the balance system "
5962.5,is that it works together with the visual system. 
5968.1,Let's say I hear something off to my left 
5970.04,and I swing my head over to the left to see what it is. 
5974.165,There are two sources of information about where my head is 
5977.13,relative to my body and I need to know that. 
5979.97,"First of all, when I quickly move my head to the side, "
5983.93,"those little stones, as I'm referring to them, "
5986.41,"I realize they're not actually stones, "
5987.77,"but as I'm referring to them, "
5989.44,"they quickly, whoom, activate those hair cells "
5992.41,"in that one semicircular canal, "
5994.93,and send a signal off to my brain 
5996.91,"that my head just moved to the side like this, "
5998.76,not that it went like this and pitched back 
6000.67,"or not that it tilted, but it just moved to the side. "
6003.97,But also visual information slid past my field of view. 
6008.75,"I didn't have to think about it, "
6009.75,but just slid past my field of view. 
6011.67,"And when those two signals combine, "
6015.72,my eyes then lock to a particular location. 
6018.63,"Now, if this is at all complicated, "
6021.27,you can actually uncouple these things. 
6023.82,It's very easy to do. You can do this right now. 
6026.21,"In fact, I'd like you to do this experiment "
6027.91,if you're not already doing something else 
6029.61,that requires your attention. 
6030.84,"And certainly, don't do this if you're driving. "
6033.106,You're going to sit down and you're going to move your head 
6037.22,to the left very slowly with your eyes open. 
6042.09,"So you're going to move it very, very slowly. "
6045.39,"The whole thing should take about five, six, "
6047.46,maybe even 
10,seconds to complete. 
6052.15,"Okay, I just did it. "
6053.72,"Now, I'm going to do it very quickly. "
6054.98,I'd like you to do it very quickly as well. 
6058.35,Now do it slowly again. 
6064.27,What you probably noticed 
6065.78,"is that it's very uncomfortable to do it slowly, "
6069.44,but you can do it very quickly 
6072.07,without much discomfort at all. 
6073.39,You just move your head to the side. 
6074.97,"The reason is when you move your head, very slowly, "
6078.81,"those little stones at the base of that hula hoop, "
6082.03,they don't get enough momentum to move. 
6084.06,So you're actually not generating this signal 
6087.57,to the brain that your head is moving. 
6089.23,"And what you'll notice is that your eyes have to go, "
6091.677,"boom, boom, boom, jumping over step-by-step. "
6095.33,"Whereas if you move your head really quickly, "
6097.29,the signal gets off to your brain and your eyes 
6098.94,"just go boom, right to the location you want to look at. "
6101.88,So moving your body slowly is actually very disruptive 
6106.32,to the vestibular system. 
6108.96,And it's very disruptive to your visual system. 
6112.31,"Now, if you've ever had the misfortune "
6113.68,of being on a boat and you're going through big oscillations 
6116.69,"on the boat, for those of you seasick, "
6117.842,"folks that get seasick, "
6119.69,this can actually make certain people seasick 
6121.51,"just to hear about it, those big oscillations "
6124.62,going up and down and up and down. 
6127.04,Those are very disruptive. 
6128.37,We'll talk about nausea in a minute 
6130.06,and how to offset that kind of nausea. 
6132.1,"I get pretty seasick, but there are ways "
6133.56,that you can deal with this but this is incredible 
6137.5,because what it means is a purely physical system 
6139.36,of these little stones rolling around in there 
6142.23,and directing where your eyes should go. 
6144.96,So you can do this also just by looking up. 
6147.18,"So let's just say, you're sitting in a chair, "
6149.24,you're going to look up towards the ceiling 
6151.04,and your eyes will just go there. 
6152.32,You're doing this eyes open and you look down. 
6154.23,"Now try doing it right really, really slowly. "
6162.02,"Some people even get motion sick doing this, "
6164.29,"which if you do, then just stop. "
6166.24,"Okay, so you can do this also to the side, "
6169.12,although it works best if you're moving your head 
6170.451,from side to side and we're nodding up and down. 
6175.37,So what we're doing here is we're uncoupling 
6177.44,"these two mechanisms, we're pulling them apart, "
6179.19,"the visual part and the vestibular part, "
6180.97,"just to illustrate to you that, normally, "
6183.78,these mechanisms in your inner ear tell your eyes 
6187.7,"where to go, but as well, "
6190.0,"your eyes tell your balance system, your vestibular system, "
6194.07,how to function. 
6195.45,So I'd like you to do a different experiment. 
6198.05,"I'm not going to do it right now, but basically stand up. "
6201.57,"If you get the opportunity, you can do this safely, "
6203.26,"wherever you are, you're going to stand up "
6205.12,and you're going to look forward about 
"10,",
12,feet. 
6208.02,"Pick a point on a wall or you can, "
6209.901,"anywhere that you like, if you're out in public, "
6212.67,just do it anyway. 
6213.71,"Just tell them you're listening to Huberman Lab Podcasts, "
6216.838,and someone's telling you to do it. 
6218.94,"Anyway, if you don't want to do it, don't do it. "
6220.32,"But, basically, do it. "
6221.54,Stand on one leg and lift up the other leg. 
6225.16,"You can bend your knee, if you like "
6226.58,and just look off into the distance about 
"10,",
12,feet. 
6231.55,"If you can do that, if you can stand on one leg, "
6233.6,"now close your eyes, chances are you're going "
6237.09,to suddenly feel what scientists call postural sway. 
6240.41,You're going to start swaying around a lot. 
6242.52,It is very hard to balance with your eyes closed. 
6246.634,"And if you think about that, it's like, why is that? "
6249.13,That's crazy. 
6250.1,Why would it be that it's hard to balance 
6251.95,with your eyes closed? 
6252.783,"Well, information about the visual world also feeds back "
6256.634,onto this vestibular system. 
6258.76,So the vestibular system informs your vision 
6260.77,and tells you where to move your eyes 
6262.16,and your eyes and their positioning tell 
6264.75,"your balance system, your vestibular system "
6267.03,how it should function. 
6268.7,So there's a really cool way 
6271.07,that you can learn to optimize balance. 
6273.73,You're not going to try and do this by learning 
6275.37,to balance with your eyes closed. 
6277.33,What you can do is you can raise one leg 
6281.08,"and you can look at a short distance, "
6283.04,maybe off to just the distance that your thumb would be 
6285.27,if you were to reach your arm out in front of you. 
6286.73,Although you don't necessarily have to put 
6288.29,your thumb in front of you. 
6289.123,So maybe just about two feet in front of you. 
6291.57,"Then while still balancing, "
6292.74,"you're going to step your vision out a further distance, "
6296.26,and then a further distance 
6297.45,and as far as you can possibly see 
6298.87,in the environment that you're in. 
6300.45,And then you're going to march it back to you. 
6303.24,"Now, what the literature shows "
6305.57,is that this kind of balance training 
6307.59,"where you incorporate the visual system and extending out, "
6312.409,and then marching back in the point 
6314.62,"at which you direct your visual focus, "
6316.93,sends robust information about the relationship 
6320.51,between your visual world and your balance system. 
6323.793,"And, of course, the balance system includes "
6325.49,"not just these hula hoops, these semicircular canals, "
6328.59,"but they communicate with the cerebellum, "
6330.47,"the so-called mini-brain, it actually means mini-brain "
6332.7,"in the back of your brain, "
6333.93,combines that with visual information 
6335.47,and your map of the body surface. 
6339.13,That pattern of training is very beneficial 
6344.53,for enhancing your ability to balance 
6347.36,because the ability to balance 
6349.19,"is, in part, the activation of particular postural muscles, "
6353.35,"but just as much, perhaps even moreso, "
6357.25,"it's about being able to adjust those postural muscles, "
6362.5,"excuse me, it's about the ability "
6363.688,to adjust those postural muscles 
6365.671,as you experience changes in your visual world. 
6368.77,And one of the most robust ways 
6370.64,that you can engage changes in your visual world 
6373.37,is through your own movement. 
6375.2,And so most people are not trying 
6376.87,"to balance in place, right? "
6379.3,They're not just trying to stand there 
6380.6,like a statue on one leg. 
6382.27,Most of what we think about when we think about balance 
6384.22,is for sake of sport or dynamic balance 
6386.8,"of being able to break ourselves, "
6389.09,when we're lunging in one particular direction 
6390.87,"to stop ourselves, that is, "
6392.22,and then to move in another direction 
6393.96,or for skateboarding or surfing or cycling 
6396.74,"or any number of different things, gymnastics. "
6399.21,So the visual system is the primary input 
6401.97,"by which you develop balance, "
6403.37,but you can't do it just with the visual system. 
6406.49,So what I'm recommending is if you're interested 
6409.34,"in cultivating a sense of balance, "
6410.73,"understand the relationship between the semicircular canals, "
6414.47,understand that they are both driving eye movements 
6418.85,and they are driven by eye movements. 
6421.13,It's a reciprocal relationship. 
6423.1,"And then even just two or three minutes a day, "
6426.54,"or every once in a while, even three times a week, "
6430.04,"maybe five minutes, maybe "
10,"minutes, you pick, "
6433.54,"but if you want to enhance balance, "
6434.86,you have to combine changes in your visual environment 
6438.9,"with a static posture, standing on one leg "
6441.23,"and shifting your visual environment or static visual view, "
6448.36,looking at one thing and changing your body posture. 
6452.44,"So those two things, "
6453.69,"we now know from the scientific literature, "
6456.047,combine in order to give an enhanced sense of balance. 
6459.07,And there's a really nice paper that was published in 
2015,
6462.65,called Effects of Balance Training on Balance Performance. 
6465.59,This was in healthy adults. 
6467.98,It's a systematic review and a meta analysis. 
6471.04,A meta analysis is when you combine 
6472.67,a lot of literature from a lot of different papers 
6474.69,and extract the really robust 
6476.68,and the less robust statistical effects. 
6479.33,So it's a really nice paper as well. 
6482.12,"There are some papers out there, for instance, "
6484.96,comparison of static balance 
6486.81,and the role of vision in the elite athletes. 
6489.4,This is essentially the paper 
6490.84,that I've extracted most of the information 
6492.376,that I just gave you from. 
6494.57,"And that paper, and there are some others as well, "
6498.24,but basically I distilled them down 
6499.86,into their core components. 
6500.86,The core components are move your vision around 
6503.94,"while staying static, still "
6506.9,"but in a balanced position like standing on one leg, "
6509.37,could be something more complicated 
6510.68,if you're somebody who can do more complicated movements. 
6514.72,"Unilateral movement seemed to be important, "
6517.2,"so standing on one leg as opposed to both, "
6520.43,or trying to generate some tilt is another way 
6524.04,"to go about it or imbalance, "
6525.45,meaning one limb asymmetrically being activated 
6528.14,compared to the other limb. 
6529.83,And then the other way to encourage 
6532.81,or to cultivate and build up this vestibular system 
6536.74,"and your sense of balance actually involves movement itself, "
6540.43,acceleration. 
6541.48,So that's what we're going to talk about now. 
6543.49,"So up until now, I've been talking about balance "
6545.37,"only in the static sense, "
6546.73,"like standing on one leg for instance, "
6548.47,but that's a very artificial situation. 
6551.09,"Even though you can train balance that way, "
6553.21,most people who want to enhance their sense of balance 
6555.84,"for sport or dance, or some other endeavor, "
6558.83,"want to engage balance in a dynamic way, "
6561.55,"meaning moving through lots of different planes of movement, "
6564.22,maybe even sometimes while squatting down low 
6566.9,or jumping and landing or making trajectories 
6570.13,that are different angles. 
6572.73,"For that, we need to consider "
6574.49,that the vestibular system also cares about acceleration. 
6579.248,"So it cares about head position, "
6581.01,it cares about eye position and where the eyes are 
6583.58,"and where you're looking, but it also cares "
6585.66,about what direction you're moving and how fast. 
6589.43,And one of the best things that you can do 
6592.46,to enhance your sense of balance 
6594.9,"is to start to bring together your visual system, "
6599.44,the semicircular canals of the inner ear 
6602.33,and what we call linear acceleration. 
6605.11,"So if I move forward in space rigidly upright, "
6608.92,it's a vastly different situation 
6611.04,than if I'm leaning to the side. 
6614.64,One of the best ways to cultivate 
6617.45,"a better sense of balance, literally, "
6620.28,within the sense organs and the neurons 
6623.03,and the biology of the brain is to get into modes 
6627.99,"where we are accelerating forward, typically, "
6631.08,it's forward while also tilted with respect to gravity. 
6635.68,Now this would be the carve on a skateboard 
6638.51,or on a surf board or a snowboard. 
6640.76,This would be the taking a corner on a bike 
6644.28,"while being able to lean, safely, of course, "
6646.81,lean into the turn so that your head 
6649.31,is actually tilted with respect to the earth. 
6652.89,"So anytime that we are rigidly upright, "
6655.78,we aren't really exercising the vestibular system imbalance. 
6660.42,And this is why you see people in the gym 
6662.38,"on these, one of those bouncy balls, "
6664.71,Bocce balls are the one that the guys roll in the park. 
6667.52,"Bouncy balls, where they're balancing back and forth, "
6669.313,that will work the small stabilizing muscles. 
6671.94,But what I'm talking about is getting into modes 
6673.87,where you actually tilt the body and the head 
6677.28,with respect to earth. 
6680.58,What I mean is with respect to Earth's gravitational pull. 
6684.11,Now the cerebellum is a very interesting structure 
6687.37,"because not only is it involved in balance, "
6689.85,but it's also involved in skill-learning 
6693.04,and in generating timing of movements. 
6695.97,It's a fascinating structure deserving 
6697.68,"of an entire episode or several episodes all on its own, "
6701.8,"but some of the outputs of the cerebellum, "
6705.0,"meaning the neurons in the cerebellum get inputs, "
6707.85,but they also send information out. 
6710.52,The outputs of the cerebellum are strongly linked 
6713.4,to areas of the brain that release neuromodulators 
6716.56,"that make us feel really good, in particular, "
6719.56,serotonin and dopamine. 
6721.35,"And this is an early emerging sub-field within neuroscience, "
6724.666,but a lot of what are called the non-motor outputs 
6727.91,"of the cerebellum have a profound influence, "
6731.23,"not just on our ability to learn how to balance better, "
6735.67,but also how we feel overall. 
6738.46,"So for you exercisers out there, "
6740.77,I do hope people are getting 
6741.847,regular healthy amounts of exercise. 
6743.93,"We've talked about what that means in previous episodes, "
6746.59,so at least 
150,"minutes a week of endurance work, "
6749.12,"some strength training, "
6749.953,a minimum five sets per body part to maintain musculature 
6753.37,"even if you don't want to grow muscles, "
6754.91,"you want to do that in order to maintain healthy, "
6756.94,"strengthened bones, et cetera. "
6759.48,If you're doing that but you're only doing things 
6762.58,"like curls in the gym, squats in the gym, "
6764.75,"riding the Peloton, or even if you're outside running, "
6767.48,"and you're getting forward acceleration, "
6769.48,"but you're never actually getting tilted, "
6771.36,you're never actually getting tilted 
6772.85,"with respect to Earth's gravitational pull, "
6776.44,you're not really exercising and getting the most 
6781.25,out of your nervous system. 
6783.22,Activation of the cerebellum in this way 
6786.72,of being tilted or the head being tilted 
6788.98,"and the body being tilted while in acceleration, "
6791.34,"typically forward acceleration, "
6793.01,but sometimes side to side has a profound 
6796.82,and positive effect on our sense of mood and wellbeing. 
6800.2,"And as I talked about in previous episode, "
6802.88,it can also enhance our ability to learn information 
6806.22,in the period after generating those tilts. 
6809.64,And the acceleration. 
6811.38,And that's because the cerebellum has these outputs 
6813.84,to these areas of the brain 
6814.89,"that release these neuromodulators, "
6816.49,like serotonin and dopamine. 
6818.8,And they make us feel really good. 
6821.46,"I think this is one of the reasons why, growing up, "
6824.19,"I had some friends, some of whom might've been "
6826.628,the world heavyweight champions of laziness 
6830.27,"for essentially everything, "
6832.17,except they would wake up at 
4:,
30,in the morning to go surf. 
6836.34,"They would drive, they would get up so early to go surf. "
6840.11,"It's not just surfers and some surfers, by the way, "
6842.45,I should point out are not lazy humans. 
6844.73,They do a lot of other things. 
6846.07,"But I knew people that couldn't be motivated to do anything, "
6848.97,but they were highly driven to get into these experiences 
6853.16,of forward acceleration while tilted 
6855.24,"with respect to gravity, "
6856.61,"likewise, with snowboarding or skiing or cycling. "
6861.15,Those modes of exercise seem to have an outsized effect 
6865.85,both on our wellbeing and our ability 
6868.42,to translate the vestibular balance that we achieve 
6872.53,in those endeavors to our ability to balance 
6875.25,"while doing other things, "
6876.77,and I don't mean psychological balance necessarily. 
6879.71,I mean physical balance. 
6881.59,So for those of you that don't think of yourselves 
6883.49,"as very coordinated or with very good balance, "
6887.01,getting into these modes of acceleration forward movement 
6889.88,"or lateral movement while getting tilted, "
6891.76,"even if you have to do it slowly, could be beneficial, "
6894.26,"I do believe, and the scientific literature points "
6896.087,to the fact that it will be beneficial 
6898.75,for cultivating better sense of physical balance. 
6902.54,It can really build up the circuits 
6904.47,of this vestibular system. 
6906.32,"And then, of course, the feel-good components "
6908.82,of acceleration while tilted or while getting the head 
6912.38,"into different orientations relative to gravity, "
6915.858,"well, that's the explanation for roller-coasters. "
6918.78,Some people hate roller-coasters. 
6920.08,They make them feel nauseous. 
6921.99,Many people love roller-coasters 
6924.87,and one of the reasons they love roller-coasters 
6926.75,"is because of the way that when you get the body, "
6930.33,"even if you're not generating the movement, "
6931.93,you get the body into forward acceleration 
6934.03,and you're going upside down and tilted to the side 
6936.54,"as the tracks go from side to side and tilt, et cetera, "
6939.27,you're getting activation of these deeper brain nuclei 
6942.84,that trigger the release of neuromodulators 
6945.31,"that just make us feel really, really good. "
6947.23,"In fact, some people get a long arc, "
6949.45,a long duration buzz from having gone 
6951.87,through those experiences. 
6953.12,Some people who hate roller-coasters 
6954.464,"are probably getting nauseous, just hearing about that. "
6958.0,So I encourage people to get into modes of acceleration 
6961.77,"while tilted every once in a while, "
6963.32,provided you can do it safely. 
6964.71,It's an immensely powerful way to build up your skills 
6968.59,in the realm of balance. 
6970.16,"And it's also, for most people, very, very pleasing. "
6974.07,It feels really good because of the chemical relationship 
6976.66,between forward acceleration and head tilt and body tilt. 
6981.23,"Now, speaking of feeling nauseous, "
6984.93,some people suffer from vertigo. 
6987.27,"Some people feel dizzy, some people get lightheaded. "
6991.41,"An important question to ask yourself, always, "
6993.95,"if you're feeling quote-unquote dizzy or lightheaded, "
6996.56,is are you dizzy or are you lightheaded? 
6999.66,"Now, we're not going to diagnose anything here "
7001.74,because there's just no way we can do that. 
7003.47,This is essentially me shouting into a tunnel. 
7005.35,So we don't know what's going on 
7006.83,with each and every one of you 
7008.28,"but if ever you feel that your world is spinning, "
7013.2,"but that you can focus on your thumb, for instance, "
7016.55,but the rest of the world is spinning 
7018.61,"and your thumb is stationary, that's called being dizzy. "
7022.81,"Now, if you feel like you're falling "
7025.19,or that you feel like you need to get down 
7027.21,"onto the ground because you feel light-headed, "
7030.45,that's being light-headed. 
7032.08,"And, oftentimes, with language we don't distinguish "
7034.38,between being dizzy and being lightheaded. 
7036.62,Now there are a lot of ways that dizziness 
7039.21,and lightheadedness can occur. 
7041.03,And I don't even want to begin to guess at the number 
7042.87,of different things and ways that it could happen 
7045.53,for those of you that suffer from it 
7046.78,because it could be any number of them. 
7048.96,"But, oftentimes, if people are lightheaded, yes, "
7052.26,it could be low blood sugar. 
7053.24,It could also be that you're dehydrated. 
7055.86,It could also be that you are low in electrolytes. 
7058.77,"We talked about this in a previous episode, "
7060.71,but we will talk about it more in a future episode. 
7063.33,"Many people have too little sodium in their system, salt, "
7066.96,and that's why they feel lightheaded. 
7069.38,"I have family members who, for years, "
7071.26,thought they had disrupted blood sugar. 
7073.82,"They would get shaky, jittery, lightheaded, "
7076.98,"feel like they were nauseous, et cetera. "
7079.19,And simply the addition of little sea salt 
7082.21,to their water remedied the problem entirely. 
7084.36,I don't think it's going to remedy every issue 
7086.71,"of lightheadedness out there by any stretch, "
7088.98,"but just the addition of salt, in this particular case, "
7092.06,helped the person. 
7092.94,And they are not alone. 
7094.64,"Many people who think that they have low blood sugar, "
7096.48,actually are lightheaded because of low electrolytes 
7099.58,and because of the way that salt carries water 
7102.96,"into the system and creates changes in blood volume, "
7105.5,et cetera. 
7106.85,Low sodium can often be a source of lightheadedness 
7110.5,"as can low blood sugar and, of course, "
7112.34,other things as well. 
7113.47,"Now for dizziness or seasickness, "
7116.04,we were all taught that you need to pick a point 
7118.92,on the horizon and focus on it. 
7121.74,"But actually, that's not correct. "
7125.8,It is true that if you are down in the cabin of a boat 
7129.5,or you're on the lower deck and all you can see 
7132.07,"are things up close to you, "
7134.81,"that getting sloshed around, like so "
7137.28,"or the boat going up and down, like so, "
7139.88,"I think I'm getting a little seasick, even as I do this "
7141.497,"and I describe it, "
7146.27,focusing on things close to you can be problematic. 
7149.16,"And in that case, the advice to go up on deck "
7152.42,"and get fresh air and to look off into the horizon, "
7155.94,that part is correct. 
7157.63,But focusing your eyes on a particular location 
7160.06,on the horizon is effectively like trying 
7163.11,"to move very slowly as I had you do before, "
7166.3,where you're trying to move your head very slowly 
7168.28,while fixating on one location. 
7170.53,Your eyes and your balance system were designed 
7172.41,to move together. 
7173.97,"So really, what you want to do is allow your visual system "
7176.83,to track with your vestibular system. 
7180.26,This is why sitting in the back of an Uber or a taxi 
7183.47,and being on your phone 
7185.34,can make you suddenly feel very nauseous. 
7187.75,"Sometimes the cabs, particularly in New York City, "
7189.73,"they have a lot of occluders, "
7191.05,they have a lot of stuff blocking your field of view. 
7193.22,There's usually a little portal where you can see out 
7195.66,"to the front of the front windshield, "
7199.27,"but there's all this stuff now, "
7200.34,televisions in the back seat and you're watching 
7202.36,that television and the cab is moving. 
7204.15,"You're in linear acceleration, "
7205.902,"and sometimes you're taking corners, you're braking "
7209.05,so then your vestibular system has to adjust to that. 
7211.71,"If you're looking at your phone or a book, "
7214.54,"or even if you're talking to somebody, actually, "
7217.28,I'm starting to feel a little nauseous 
7218.38,just talking about it. 
7219.213,I promise I'm not going to finish this episode 
7220.93,"by vomiting at the end, at least not here, "
7223.9,but what can happen is that you're uncoupling 
7227.798,"the visual information from your motion, "
7231.14,from your vestibular information. 
7232.88,You want those to be coupled. 
7234.2,"This is why a lot of people have to drive, "
7236.96,they can't be in the passenger seat. 
7238.44,"Because when you drive, "
7239.273,you also get what's called proprioceptive feedback. 
7241.52,Your body is sending signals also to the vestibular system 
7244.95,about where you are in space. 
7246.91,"When you're the passenger, "
7248.1,you're just getting jolted around as the person is driving. 
7251.16,"And if you're looking at your phone, it's even worse. "
7253.37,And if you're looking at the occluder 
7254.7,"between you and the two front seats, that's even worse. "
7258.71,So this is why staring out the front windshield is great 
7261.4,but you don't want to fixate. 
7262.76,"So, hopefully, I spared a few people and, hopefully, "
7266.45,a few cab drivers of having people get sick 
7268.51,in their cars or Ubers. 
7271.33,Let your visual system 
7272.41,and your vestibular system work together. 
7275.36,"If appropriate, get into linear acceleration, "
7278.6,and you'll improve your sense of balance. 
7280.85,"Once again, we've covered "
7282.01,a tremendous amount of information. 
7283.841,"Now, you know how you hear, "
7285.98,"how you make sense of the sounds in your environment, "
7289.59,how those come into your ears 
7291.13,and how your brain processes them. 
7293.44,"In addition, we talked about things "
7295.12,"like low level white noise and even binaural beats, "
7298.14,"which can be used to enhance certain brain states, "
7300.78,"certain rhythms within the brain, "
7302.38,and even dopamine release in ways 
7304.61,that allow you to learn better. 
7306.84,And we talked about the balance system 
7308.337,and this incredible relationship 
7309.955,"between your vestibular apparatus, "
7312.98,meaning the portions of your inner ear 
7315.21,that are responsible for balance 
7316.55,and your visual system and gravity. 
7319.58,"And you can use those to enhance your learning as well, "
7322.83,as well as just to enhance your sense of balance. 
7325.68,"If you're learning from this podcast, "
