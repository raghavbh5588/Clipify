0.3,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
1.78,where we discuss science
and,science based tools
4.89,for everyday life.
9.03,I'm Andrew Huberman
9.99,and I'm a professor of
neurobiology,and ophthalmology
12.69,at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.43,Today we are discussing
focus,and concentration
17.52,and tools for improving your
focus,and concentration.
20.7,This is a topic that
I've,covered previously
22.53,"on the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
but,in different contexts.
25.29,"For instance, we had a very"
popular,"episode on ADHD,"
27.93,"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"
30.09,which of course relates
to,the topic of focus
32.1,and how to improve focus.
33.48,We've also talked a lot about
dopamine,motivation and drive.
36.48,"In fact, that's the title of your previous"
38.58,also quite popular
episode,"of this podcast,"
40.877,but never before have we had a
single,episode solely devoted
45.3,to the tools to improve
focus,and concentration.
47.91,The rationale for recording this episode
49.95,is to provide people one
location,where they can go
52.56,and quickly access the specific tools
54.48,for increasing focus and concentration
56.46,that are known to be
the,most powerful tools
59.04,and the most up to date tools.
60.75,"In fact, today's episode is"
going,to include description
63.54,of several peer reviewed studies
65.4,and the tools that emerge
66.54,from those scientific
peer,reviewed studies
68.37,"that point to new,"
69.69,"and fortunately, even briefer protocols"
72.03,than I've described before.
73.35,So what I'm basically
describing,here is tools
76.14,that in a very short amount of time
78.06,will allow you to significantly increase
79.66,your focus and concentration abilities.
82.56,"Those tools will include behavioral tools,"
84.6,"nutrition based tools,"
supplement,"based tools,"
87.0,"brain machine interface based tools,"
88.92,and for those of you that
are,"working with a physician,"
91.41,prescription drug tools.
93.12,"Today's episode ought to benefit anybody,"
95.16,young or old or anything in between
97.35,whether or not you have ADHD or not.
99.99,Today's episode is going to give you tools
101.73,"that you can apply in your daily life,"
103.56,most all of them are completely zero cost
105.63,and those tools will allow you
107.91,to tap into the neurochemistry
109.65,and the neurocircuits
within,your brain and body
111.78,that peer-reviewed
science,has reliably shown
114.42,can significantly improve
116.04,your focus and concentration abilities.
118.47,Just to give you a little teaser
119.4,of the kinds of tools that
I'm,going to provide you
121.08,"on today's episode,"
122.31,a previous guest on the
Huberman,Lab Podcast
124.11,was Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
125.4,Dr. Suzuki is a professor of
psychology,and neuroscience
128.67,"at New York University, or NYU"
as,it's commonly referred to.
132.09,She's also the Dean of
Arts,and Sciences at NYU.
135.81,Her laboratory made a
very,"important discovery,"
138.21,"which was that a very brief, just 12,"
140.94,"actually 13 if you really count the intro,"
143.52,but 13 minute daily meditation
146.01,performed for a period
of,about eight weeks
148.62,significantly increased
150.03,people's focus and
concentration,abilities.
152.16,And the great news is you
didn't,"need all eight weeks,"
154.41,it was just that's how long
that,you ran the study.
156.54,"So during today's episode,"
157.71,I will describe that protocol in detail.
159.84,I'll also provide you an even briefer
161.82,alternative to that
protocol,"that you can use,"
164.43,"if for instance, you find yourself"
165.81,with only three minutes or four minutes
167.61,or five minutes a day to meditate.
169.77,The great news is there's
quality,peer reviewed science
171.93,to support that form of meditation
174.15,for improving focus and concentration.
176.82,And that falls under the
bin,of these zero cost tools
179.91,that you can really use to
tap,into the neurochemistry
182.01,and neurocircuits that really allow you
183.81,to take control of your
cognitive,abilities
185.49,and improve them over time.
187.5,I'll also provide you important details
189.12,about that protocol and other protocols.
190.68,"For instance,"
191.94,"contrary to popular belief, it is not,"
194.1,I repeat it is not a good idea
195.96,to do a focused based meditation
198.36,within the four hours before bedtime.
200.85,"Many people,"
201.683,including some of the
subjects,in that study
203.58,"performed by the Suzuki lab,"
205.658,found that when they did a
focusing,"meditation protocol,"
210.03,"even if it was very calming,"
211.62,it led to difficulties in
falling,and staying asleep.
214.86,So that runs counter to
a,lot of what we've heard
216.6,about meditation being great for sleep.
218.34,It turns out meditation
might,"be great for sleep,"
220.2,it certainly is great for
improving,"focus capacity,"
222.78,but I highly recommend that
if,you're going to apply
224.67,a focus meditation tool
226.53,in order to improve your
focus,"and concentration,"
228.84,that you make sure that that's performed
230.61,not within four hours prior to bedtime.
233.58,So that's just a brief example
234.87,of the sorts of tools and protocols
236.82,and details about the tools and protocols
238.53,that I'll provide on today's episode.
240.54,I should mention that
we,have provided links
242.76,in the show note captions
244.02,so that you can quickly go to
the,studies that we describe
246.63,as well as some of the behavioral tools
248.19,"and other tools that we'll cover,"
250.62,"things like the use of binaural beats,"
252.15,"supplements, et cetera."
253.35,Our goal here again
254.28,is to provide you the
maximum,number of tools
256.59,for focus and concentration
that,you can pick from
259.05,and choose from and apply in your life
260.73,and try to eliminate as
much,of the legwork required
263.67,to seek out and apply those tools.
266.01,I'm pleased to announce that
the,Huberman Lab Podcast
267.9,is now partnered with
Momentous,supplements.
270.21,We partnered with Momentous
for,several important reasons.
272.46,"First of all,"
273.293,"they ship internationally,"
274.14,because we know that many of you
275.52,are located outside of the
United,"States, that's valuable."
278.91,"Second of all, and perhaps most important,"
280.92,the quality of their
supplements,"is second to none,"
283.5,both in terms of purity and precision
285.15,of the amounts of the ingredients.
287.1,"Third, we've really emphasized supplements"
289.71,that are single ingredient supplements
291.78,and that are supplied in dosages
294.0,that allow you to build a
supplementation,protocol
296.97,"that's optimized for cost,"
298.8,"that's optimized for effectiveness,"
300.69,and that you can add things
302.16,and remove things from your protocol
303.81,in a way that's really
systematic,and scientific.
305.85,This is really hard to do
307.2,if you're taking blends
of,different supplements
309.06,or if the dosages are such
that,"you can't titrate,"
311.79,"or that is adjust the dosages,"
of,a given supplement.
315.18,"So by using single ingredient supplements,"
317.82,you can really build
out,the supplement kit
319.5,that's ideal for you
and,your specific needs.
322.59,If you'd like to see the supplements
323.76,"that we partner with Momentous on,"
325.08,you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
328.2,There you'll see those supplements.
329.31,And just keep in mind
330.36,that we are constantly expanding
the,library of supplements
332.88,available through Momentous
on,a regular basis.
335.106,"Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman."
337.668,"Before we begin,"
338.94,I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
340.53,is separate from my teaching
and,research roles at Stanford.
343.23,"It is, however, part"
of,my desire and effort
345.3,to bring zero cost to consumer information
347.13,about science and science related tools
349.11,to the general public.
350.49,"In keeping with that theme,"
351.6,I'd like to thank the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
354.3,Our first sponsor is Thesis.
356.22,Thesis makes custom nootropics.
358.02,"And to be quite honest,"
358.853,I don't like the word nootropics
360.36,because the translation of
nootropics,is smart drugs.
363.429,"And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you"
365.94,there is no neural circuit
in,the brain for being smart.
368.79,"Rather, there are neural circuits"
370.71,"that are responsible for focus,"
372.06,"neural circuits for creativity,"
373.89,"neural circuits, for task"
switching,and so on and so on.
376.83,"Fortunately, Thesis understands this"
378.72,and has developed custom nootropics
380.28,that are tailored to your specific goals
381.93,and your specific needs.
383.52,They use only the highest
quality,"ingredients,"
386.34,things of the sort that we'll
talk,"about in today's podcast,"
388.86,"things like Alpha-GPC, phosphatidylserine,"
391.32,"ginko biloba, et cetera."
392.97,"However, I should mention that"
they,are customized to you.
395.37,"So you can go to Thesis,"
take,"a brief quiz,"
397.74,and you can get a nootropic starter kit
400.2,that will allow you to
try,various nootropics
402.12,and determine which ones
you,like and work for you
403.707,and which ones don't.
404.88,I've been using Thesis
nootropics,customized for me
407.22,for close to six months now
408.48,and can confidently say
409.62,that their nootropics have
been,a total game changer.
412.17,"My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula,"
414.57,"I like to use that before cognitive work,"
416.22,and I use the Energy
Formula,before my workouts.
418.65,To get your own personalized
nootropic,"starter kit,"
420.57,"go online to takethesis.com/huberman,"
423.36,take that three minute quiz
424.59,and Thesis will send you
four,different formulas
426.48,to try in your first month.
427.62,"Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman"
430.29,and use the code Huberman at checkout
432.12,to get 10% off your first box.
434.34,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by LMNT.
436.77,LMNT is an electrolyte drink
438.27,that has all the things you
need,and none of what you don't.
440.94,"That means the electrolytes,"
442.23,"salt, magnesium, and"
potassium,"are in there,"
444.75,but it does not have sugar.
447.03,"Electrolytes are key to cellular function,"
449.43,in particular neuronal
or,nerve cell function.
451.89,"In fact, for your nerve cells"
453.15,"to be able to fire action potentials,"
454.98,those are the electrical signals
456.54,that allow your brain and body
457.95,"to work and move and think,"
et,"cetera, you need sodium,"
460.68,a lot of people don't realize that.
462.15,And while of course there
are,people out there
463.53,"that need to reduce their sodium intake,"
465.48,these would be people with
pre-hypertension,"or hypertension,"
468.15,many people actually
don't,"get enough sodium,"
470.07,especially people that are
following,"low carbohydrate diets,"
472.77,drinking a lot of caffeine
or,eating extremely clean.
475.83,"Oftentimes, those people feel better"
477.72,when they increase their sodium intake
479.19,and their health can actually improve
480.39,when they increase their sodium intake.
481.86,LMNT contains a science
backed,electrolyte ratio
483.87,"of one gram of sodium, 200"
milligrams,of potassium
486.42,and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
488.34,"If you'd like to try LMNT,"
489.51,"you can go to drinklmnt,"
that's,l-m-n-t.com/huberman

sample,pack with any purchase.
495.75,"Again, that's drink LMNT,"
l-m-n-t.com/huberman.,
499.38,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Eight Sleep.
501.662,Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
503.49,"with heating, cooling, and"
sleep,tracking capacity.
506.52,The reality is that
sleep,is the foundation
508.89,"of mental health, physical"
"health,",and performance.
511.35,Now I've talked before in
this,podcast about the fact
513.6,that there's a direct
relationship,between temperature
516.15,and our ability to fall and stay asleep.
518.13,"In fact, our body temperature"
519.3,needs to drop by about
one,to three degrees
521.07,in order to fall asleep
521.903,and then there are further
decreases,in our body temperature
525.48,that allow us to get into
the,deepest stages of sleep
527.73,and the so-called rapid
eye,"movement sleep,"
529.98,all the aspects of sleep
531.0,that really restore our brain and body.
532.92,And then waking up
533.85,actually involves a heating
up,of core body temperature.
536.73,By sleeping on an Eight
Sleep,"mattress cover,"
538.8,you're able to control the temperature
540.36,of your sleeping environment precisely.
542.31,I've been sleeping on an
Eight,Sleep mattress cover
544.71,for many months now
545.97,and I can tell you it has
completely,changed my sleep.
548.52,I thought I was sleeping
pretty,"well before and now,"
550.484,"frankly, I don't even want to travel"
552.42,because I don't want to be
away,from my Eight Sleep.
553.92,I can't wait until hotels and
Airbnbs,include Eight Sleep.
557.34,"If you want to try Eight Sleep,"
558.3,you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

577.5,"Okay, let's talk about"
focus,and concentration
580.29,and how you can improve
your,focus and concentration
583.02,using science based protocols.
585.6,Now because today's episode
is,mainly focused on tools
588.36,"and not so much the underlying mechanisms,"
590.76,I'm mainly going to focus
on,what to do and when
592.86,and how to do it.
594.12,But I just want to take
about,three minutes
596.46,"and briefly describe a model,"
598.32,that is a visual image that
you,"can put in your mind,"
601.35,that will help you incorporate
the,tools that I'll provide
604.44,and that generally will
help,you understand
606.57,at a mechanistic level how
focus,and concentration work.
610.47,So what I want you to imagine is an arrow.
613.65,"And an arrow of course, has an arrowhead"
615.81,and it has the shaft of that arrow.
618.18,And in the context of the neuroscience
620.4,"of focus and concentration,"
622.38,the neurochemical system
624.21,that really represents
the,"shaft of that arrow,"
626.76,"right, the straight line is epinephrine,"
629.46,also called adrenaline.
630.75,"And today,"
631.583,I'll refer to adrenaline and
epinephrine,interchangeably.
634.2,Turns out that epinephrine/adrenaline
636.48,are released within your
brain,"from a little location,"
639.33,a little cluster of neurons
called,"locus coeruleus,"
641.28,"but you do not need to remember that name,"
643.32,and from your body from
the,adrenal glands.
645.977,And the release of epinephrine
from,those two locations
650.61,"overall increases energy,"
it,increases alertness.
654.42,"It does not alone increase focus, okay?"
657.51,"So the reason I've assigned epinephrine,"
660.75,adrenaline as the shaft of the arrow
662.64,"is that if focus is the arrow,"
665.58,there is no focus without epinephrine.
668.64,"So things,"
669.96,whether or not they're
behavioral,or psychological
672.78,or supplements or drugs
that,increase epinephrine
676.8,"allow focus to occur, they"
are,"necessary for focus,"
680.22,"but they are not sufficient for focus,"
682.56,that is they are required
683.64,but they are not enough to create focus.
686.22,So we're going to need
epinephrine,in the equation.
688.68,"Without epinephrine, there"
is,no focus or concentration.
693.21,Now the arrowhead on this
metaphorical,arrowhead
697.56,that represents focus and concentration
699.66,is going to be represented
701.25,or related to the
mechanisms,"of acetylcholine,"
704.37,a different neurochemical
706.05,that also exists in the brain and body.
707.52,"In fact, in the body,"
708.353,it's responsible
709.186,for the contraction and
movement,of your muscles.
711.57,"But today, we're talking"
about,acetylcholine
713.34,"not in that context,"
714.33,but rather in the context of
its,release within the brain.
717.06,Acetylcholine is released
718.11,from a couple of different
locations,in the brain
720.06,and the best way to think about
it,is it's like a spotlight.
723.39,It highlights specific
"neurons,",nerve cells
726.51,"that should be active, or"
more,"active I should say,"
729.0,than the other neurons in the environment.
730.89,So the reason I've assigned
the,arrowhead to acetylcholine
735.42,and acetylcholine to the arrowhead
737.25,is that if you have an arrow
with,a very big arrowhead
740.91,"that's really broad, really broad,"
742.53,"imagine a mile wide arrowhead,"
744.6,that's not very focused
on,"any one location,"
746.52,it's not really pointing
to,"any one location, is it?"
749.19,"But with a narrow, really"
tightly,"focused arrowhead,"
753.45,"well, that's focused on one location."
755.43,"So we have alertness, epinephrine,"
757.71,and then we have the actual direction
760.59,in which our concentration
and,"focus is placed,"
763.65,"and that's,"
764.67,at least in this mental model
I'm,"creating, acetylcholine."
767.7,"And then in order to have ongoing focus,"
771.93,we need another neurochemical.
773.46,And it turns out that that
third,"neurochemical is dopamine,"
776.58,a molecule often associated
with,"pleasure and reward,"
780.0,but it's really the
molecule,of motivation.
783.21,"So here, I want you to"
imagine,"in your mind,"
784.92,"an arrow with an arrowhead,"
786.57,"think acetylcholine in the arrowhead,"
788.31,"a shaft or a line behind that arrowhead,"
790.59,which is epinephrine
also,called adrenaline.
793.08,"And then behind it,"
794.13,a sort of an engine that keeps
that,"focus moving forward,"
797.22,right because we don't just
want,"to be focused for a moment,"
799.68,we want to be able to focus
for,10 minutes or for an hour
802.44,or maybe even for two hours.
804.15,Turns out there's an
optimal,"duration to focus,"
806.13,"I'll teach you that in just a little bit,"
808.02,"but these three neurochemicals together,"
809.94,"acetylcholine, epinephrine"
and,dopamine really allow you
813.42,"to get focused, to focus very precisely,"
817.83,"and in fact, increasingly"
precisely,over time
820.62,to really narrow and narrow
and,narrow your focus
822.51,progressively within a
single,about of focus
825.39,and to continue to do that
826.737,and to be able to do that
repeatedly,whenever you want.
829.56,"So here, I'm purely talking in metaphor"
831.78,"and in models and mental models of arrows,"
833.94,"but in a moment or two,"
834.81,I'll start transitioning
to,discussing tools
837.15,in which I'll talk about
838.17,increasing dopamine and acetylcholine
840.15,or increasing epinephrine and dopamine
842.52,in various combinations
with,various approaches.
845.22,And what I'd like you to conceptualize
847.32,is how those are contributing
849.09,to creating a very narrowly pointed arrow
851.73,that has the capacity
852.78,to continue moving forward over and over
854.73,so that you can focus as
sharply,and as long as you like.
858.57,"And of course, for those of you"
859.59,that want to get really down in the weeds
861.6,"of how dopamine works,"
862.77,we have an entire episode
864.03,about dopamine motivation and drive
865.62,that really gets into
neurotransmitter,release
867.96,and dopamine baselines and thresholds
870.03,and all of that sort of thing.
871.62,"We also have episodes on focus,"
874.5,"much longer episodes,"
I,should say on focus
876.6,that incorporate a lot of
the,biology of acetylcholine.
879.15,It turns out acetylcholine
is,also involved
880.62,"in neuroplasticity, et cetera,"
882.15,and epinephrine of
"course,",relates to stress
884.607,and our capacity to deal
with,and buffer stress
886.89,and on and on.
888.39,Those episodes are all available to you
890.22,"in their long form at hubermanlab.com,"
892.95,you can find them very easily.
894.03,They are all timestamped
894.92,so you can navigate to
the,particular topics
896.88,most of interest to you.
897.96,I mention this all not as a diversion
900.0,"from what we want to cover today,"
901.41,but I know that some of you are hungry
902.73,"for a lot more mechanism,"
904.17,but today's episode is really
mainly,"focused on the tools,"
906.87,"I will of course touch on mechanism,"
909.21,but if you really want to do
the,"deep dive on mechanism,"
911.43,go to hubermanlab.com
913.02,and you'll have more
than,you ever could want
915.06,about those mechanisms.
916.8,Let's jump into the tools
for,concentration and focus.
920.37,If you want to think
about,tools of any kind
923.7,to modify your biology
or,"physiology in any way,"
926.91,whether or not it's for cognitive function
928.2,"or you want to get better at exercising,"
929.7,"or you want to build muscle,"
930.57,"or you want to improve your hormones,"
932.16,you need to think and understand tools
935.55,in the context of
modulation,and mediation.
938.94,What do I mean by that?
939.84,"Well, it's quite simple really."
942.48,Mediation is how specific
types,of chemicals and cells
946.56,and circuits and organs
control,very specific things
949.86,in your brain and body
951.09,whereas modulation
952.77,is the ability of chemicals
and,cells and circuits
955.92,"to adjust how different things change,"
958.95,how different things work
in,"your brain and body,"
961.02,but to do it more broadly.
962.67,What do I mean by this?
963.503,Let me give an example.
964.8,"For instance, I'm going to tell you now"
967.56,that one of the most important things
970.02,to build and maintain your
focus,and concentration
974.04,"is to optimize your sleeping behavior,"
977.34,that is to get enough quality sleep
979.709,I would say 80% of the
nights,of your life.
982.08,Not everyone can get optimal sleep
983.85,"100% of the nights of their life,"
985.23,"nobody, truly nobody achieves that."
988.29,"However, sleep has been shown"
990.45,to relate to cognitive
"performance,","physical performance,"
993.75,"hormone output, and so many other things,"
996.33,including immune system function.
998.4,What we can reliably say
is,that sleep modulates
1002.51,just about every process
in,your brain and body.
1005.9,So you have to get great sleep.
1007.13,There is simply no tool
that's,going to allow you
1010.25,to overcome chronic sleep deprivation
1013.04,"and allow you to remain focused,"
1014.57,"no pill, no device, no supplement,"
no,protocol whatsoever.
1018.83,There are tools to overcome one night
1020.99,or maybe two nights of sleep deprivation
1022.58,"and we'll talk about those,"
1024.05,"but at a fundamental level,"
1026.24,we need to do the things
1027.59,that modulate our focus and
attention,in powerful ways
1031.22,and sleep really is that thing.
1033.2,"So we've done two episodes,"
one,"called ""Master Your Sleep"""
1036.17,and the other episode
is,"""Perfect Your Sleep."""
1038.93,"The ""Perfect Your Sleep"""
1039.763,"is a little bit more like this episode,"
1040.97,more focused on protocols.
1042.027,"""Master Your Sleep"" includes"
protocols,and mechanism.
1044.45,"Again, you can find"
those,at hubermanlab.com.
1046.22,"We also have a sleep toolkit,"
1048.02,a distilled list of things to do
1049.43,in order to optimize your sleep.
1050.613,I highly recommend that you download that.
1052.82,"You can go to hubermanlab.com,"
1054.05,go to the Neural Network
"Newsletter,",it is listed there.
1056.18,If you want you can sign
up,"for the newsletter,"
1057.68,"but you don't have to,"
1058.58,you can simply download
the,PDF of that toolkit
1061.1,for zero cost.
1062.9,Why do I say sleep modulates
focus,and attention?
1065.96,"Well, I'll give an analogy."
1067.91,If right now someone pulled
a,fire alarm in this building
1070.82,"or if we had a fire in this building,"
1072.14,"my attention would drift,"
1074.12,"it would not be on recording this podcast,"
1076.03,it would be on something else.
1077.81,But would I say that the fire
alarm,mediates attention?
1081.11,I mean fire alarms are not
really,involved in attention.
1083.51,"No, rather they modulate my attention."
1086.66,The noise in the room
modulates,my attention.
1088.91,That's quite a bit different
1090.32,than a tool that I'll provide later
1091.64,and I'll just give you
a,"little hint of now,"
1093.23,"in fact, I'll give it to you now,"
1094.58,which is that 40 HZ binaural beats
1097.7,have been shown in a number
of,peer reviewed studies
1100.04,to increase focus and concentration.
1102.41,And if you'd like to
access,40 HZ binaural beats
1105.35,in order to improve your
focus,"and concentration,"
1107.75,"you can do that, you can"
actually,get it at zero cost.
1110.18,"You can go into the app store,"
1112.22,"for instance, the Apple App Store,"
1114.02,"this is also available for Android phone,"
1115.67,"there's an app called BrainWave,"
1117.2,"and you can go there,"
you,can dial in 40 HZ
1119.57,and it'll play these binaural beats.
1121.49,It's been shown in multiple
quality,peer reviewed studies
1123.92,that playing a pattern of
sound,"waves to one ear,"
1126.26,"do, do, do, do, do,"
1127.31,"and the other ear, which is"
slightly,"offset in frequency,"
1129.65,"meaning not quite the same frequencies,"
1131.03,"so more like do, do, do, do,"
1132.59,that that combination of frequencies
1134.24,"played to the different ears,"
1136.34,actually get integrated
within,deep brain centers
1139.31,and can increase focus and concentration
1141.44,in part by increasing levels
1143.99,of the neurochemical
dopamine,"and acetylcholine,"
1146.36,which we talked about a little bit earlier
1147.74,in this arrow model of focus.
1149.9,"So we'll provide a link to that app,"
1152.87,I don't have any relationship
to,"that app I should mention,"
1155.9,"but it's an excellent one,"
1156.77,it's one that I've used for many years.
1158.15,There are also additional
functions,"within the app,"
1160.58,"such as for sleep and for other things,"
1162.68,"but the 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z"
is,"the way it reads out,"
1167.42,40 HZ stimulation
1168.83,has been shown to improve
focus,and concentration.
1171.47,Here is my recommendation
and,the way that I use it.
1173.6,I would not use 40 HZ binaural beats
1176.33,every time I'm doing a about of work.
1178.64,What I tend to do
1179.473,is use it for about five
minutes,prior to that work
1183.05,and then turn it off and then do the work
1185.15,and I'll talk about other
tools,"to use during that work,"
1187.79,whether or not it's reading or math
1188.99,or even just emailing or
something,where I require
1191.33,a bunch of focus for a while.
1193.059,"However, there are times"
in,which I'm in an area
1196.34,or I'm in a state of mind
1197.39,where I'm feeling very distractable
1198.62,and then I'll keep the
40,HZ binaural beats on
1200.66,the entire time
1201.74,I'm doing that about of cognitive work.
1204.26,I'll also sometimes use
the,40 HZ binaural beats
1206.36,"prior to a workout,"
1207.41,"in particular weight workouts,"
1208.4,where I really want to be able to focus on
1209.87,and contract specific muscles.
1211.49,"So it's a very useful tool,"
1212.99,"again, supported by quality"
peer,"reviewed science,"
1215.63,"zero cost,"
1216.53,available out there not
just,in the BrainWave app
1218.75,but in multiple apps.
1220.52,I think many of you will benefit from it.
1222.628,Some of you might not
experience,it immediately
1225.32,as a total dropping into a tunnel of focus
1228.41,in the same way that you might
1229.67,with say the sorts of neurochemicals
1232.31,"that we'll talk about later,"
1233.18,like Alpha-GPC and some
of,these other things
1235.31,"that change neurochemicals directly,"
1237.59,but nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats
1239.99,"are a very powerful tool,"
1241.34,"again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool"
1243.59,"that tap into your own endogenous,"
1245.45,meaning within you or
exists,within you physiology
1249.05,in order to increase acetylcholine
1250.64,and some other neurochemicals
1251.96,and they have been shown
to,work quite well.
1254.6,Okay so assuming that
you,are sleeping well
1256.67,80% of the nights of your life
1258.02,or at least working on the
various,protocols and tools
1261.74,to sleep well and sufficiently long
1264.53,"80% of the nights of your life,"
1266.48,and you are interested in additional tools
1269.42,that are sound based
1271.04,in order to improve your ability
to,"concentrate and focus,"
1274.46,there are quality peer reviewed
studies,supporting the idea
1277.73,"that white noise or pink noise,"
1280.31,"and believe it or not,"
1281.143,"there is something called pink noise,"
1282.11,it has to do with the
specific,frequencies of sound
1285.2,"that are in the noise,"
1287.236,well white noise and pink noise
1289.34,have been shown to not
improve,"concentration per se,"
1293.36,but to improve people's ability
1294.98,to transition into concentrated states.
1297.89,So I don't tend to use
white,noise and pink noise
1300.05,"while I work, but I know a"
number,of people that do.
1302.39,I know people that also use
what's,called brown noise.
1304.737,The folks I know
1306.02,from the engineering and
computer,science side
1308.51,get really into these details
1309.83,"of white noise, pink noise, brown noise."
1311.66,"You can find white noise,"
pink,noise or brown noise
1314.12,and listen to it through
headphones,or in the room.
1317.27,There is indeed some data
1319.61,"to support the fact that white noise,"
1321.5,"and to some extent, pink"
noise,and brown noise
1323.57,can support the release of
particular,"neurochemicals,"
1325.64,but more data showing that
they,can amplify the activity
1329.27,of neurons in the so-called
prefrontal,"cortex,"
1331.91,"this front area, sort of the"
bumper,"behind your forehead,"
1334.88,that is directly related to your ability
1338.03,to direct your own focus
1339.68,and remain focused on certain things.
1341.96,So you have the option
1343.97,"of either using binaural beats before,"
1346.55,"but not during your work,"
that,"is 40 HZ binaural beats,"
1349.34,or 40 HZ binaural beats
throughout,your attempt to focus.
1353.99,You also have the option of
not,"using binaural beats,"
1356.87,"but using white noise,"
pink,noise or brown noise.
1359.42,"Again, there are a lot of zero cost apps,"
1361.49,"you can find also white noise,"
pink,noise and brown noise
1364.19,on YouTube.
1365.33,"Again, these are tools"
1366.56,that really have been shown
over,and over in humans
1369.68,to allow people to focus with more depth
1372.2,and to decrease the
transition,time into focus.
1375.53,This is a really key point.
1376.61,A lot of people are challenged
1378.05,with getting into a mode of focus.
1380.296,"None of us, however, should be expected"
1382.91,to just sit down and drop
directly,into a state of focus.
1385.76,I think that's completely an
unfair,request of ourselves.
1389.6,"I mean, for instance,"
1390.433,you wouldn't expect yourself
to,go out on the track
1392.48,or go out for a run and not warm up.
1394.25,You might jog for a few minutes
1395.36,or even walk before you would jog
1396.86,"and then jog before you would run,"
1398.39,"right, I would hope you would do that."
1400.01,"And if you're doing resistance training,"
1401.75,I doubt that you go over and
load,up the bar or the machine
1403.79,with the maximum amount of
weight,that you can move
1405.38,"and then just drop right into that,"
1406.28,you always do a warmup.
1407.15,And I think it's very
important,to understand
1409.1,"mental work, focus and concentration"
1410.78,as requiring that warmup.
1412.64,What is that warmup?
1414.14,"Well, you know what that warmup is."
1416.36,That warmup is the ramping up
1419.15,or the increase of
"epinephrine,","adrenaline,"
1423.5,"acetylcholine, and dopamine."
1425.93,"Right, the way that neurochemicals work"
1427.61,is we don't just get to
flip,switches in our brain
1429.5,"because we decide to, that's a fantasy."
1431.15,"That's sort of the ""Limitless"" movie"
1433.16,or movies and ideas
1435.32,that suddenly you're going
to,flip a switch on your arm
1437.0,and all of a sudden you're
going,"to be in a laser focus,"
1438.83,that is just not the way that
your,nervous system works.
1441.41,"There's a gradual dropping into any state,"
1443.81,"whether or not that state is sleep,"
1445.07,"right, you go from shallow"
sleep,to deep sleep
1446.75,and then out eventually.
1448.052,"Focus too, you go from shallow focus"
1451.85,to increasingly deep focus.
1453.74,"That is, in our metaphor of"
the,"arrow, it's very broad,"
1458.69,it's pointed at a lot of things.
1459.8,"And over time as we drop into focus,"
1461.51,that arrow is narrowing and
narrowing,and narrowing.
1464.21,"In fact, probably better"
to,think about it narrowing
1466.82,and then sometimes oscillating
and,getting wider again.
1469.909,We might hear something down the hallway
1471.74,or more typically our phone
will,"buzz or we'll think,"
1474.23,"oh, I wonder what so and so is doing"
1475.52,or I had to contact them about something.
1477.62,"Your focus is dynamic,"
1479.9,it is not what we call a step function.
1481.7,It's not like you go
from,unfocused to focused
1483.59,and then you drop into your maximal focus.
1485.9,"By understanding that it's dynamic,"
1488.06,by understanding that you
are,going to be continually
1490.31,going in and out
1491.36,of progressively but
varying,"levels of focus,"
1495.526,you will greatly release
the,pressure on yourself
1498.89,to feel focused all the
time,when you want to be.
1502.16,This is very key.
1502.993,People who are very good
at,focusing understand this
1505.52,and understand that they
can't,expect themselves
1509.27,to just immediately focus
1510.56,and then snap into or out of focus.
1513.05,Okay so be patient with yourself
1514.64,and also understand that
focus,"is an ability,"
1517.82,that you can improve your ability to focus
1519.92,by engaging the neural
circuits,responsible for focus
1522.71,repeatedly over time through
so-called,"neuroplasticity,"
1525.62,the ability of your nervous system
1527.21,to change in response to experience.
1528.86,And that has a couple
of,"different components,"
1530.66,"but put very simply,"
1531.98,what we repeat gets etched
into,our nervous system
1534.68,and becomes easier over time.
1536.51,And the more emotionally important
1539.99,"or vital something feels to us,"
1541.67,the more likely it is to
trigger,neuroplasticity.
1543.56,We're going to talk a little bit more
1544.52,about how to increase neural
circuits,"for focus later,"
1546.62,"but right now, what you have in hand"
1548.33,is the key importance of sleep
1549.92,and I again will direct
you,to hubermanlab.com
1552.68,and the Neural Network Newsletter
1553.82,to really work on optimizing your sleep.
1557.42,We've also got two
auditory,sound based tools
1561.08,"for improving focus,"
1561.92,there's 40 HZ binaural
beats,used before or during
1565.01,bouts of focus and concentration.
1566.6,And if you don't like
"those,","or even if you do,"
1569.3,you might alternate them with
1570.41,"or occasionally use white noise,"
pink,"noise or brown noise,"
1573.05,also readily available at zero cost.
1575.24,A question I often get is how
long,should I try to focus?
1578.3,"Well, the research literature"
point,to the key importance
1580.82,of so-called ultradian cycles.
1582.53,You've all probably
heard,of circadian cycles
1585.29,"or circadian biology,"
"circa,","the day, circadian,"
1589.16,is about 24 hour cycle.
1590.72,"Well, our brain and body"
operate,within that day
1593.81,or within each and every day I should say
1596.16,with 90 minute ultradian cycles.
1599.36,So my suggestion would be
1600.65,anytime you're going to
sit,down and try and focus
1602.44,or you're going to try
and,do a focused about
1604.52,of physical exercise or skill
learning,"or musical learning,"
1607.67,or maybe you're even just
having,"a conversation,"
1609.32,maybe you're a therapist
1610.28,"or you're attending therapy or a class,"
1612.02,how long should it be?
1613.13,And the ideal duration
is,"about 90 minutes,"
1616.01,"not exactly 90 minutes,"
1617.57,but we can reliably
say,"90 minutes or less,"
1620.75,"okay, it doesn't have to"
be,the full 90 minutes.
1622.85,But trying to push yourself
to,be able to drop into
1625.46,two hours of focus or
three,"hours of focus,"
1627.56,while possible is not really in line
1631.19,with what we know about
the,underlying biology.
1633.23,Everything from our sleep states
1635.09,or the different stages of
sleep,and our waking states
1637.82,is divided into these 90 minute cycles
1640.07,or so-called ultradian cycles.
1641.51,So what I like to do is
set,a timer for 90 minutes.
1644.21,I acknowledge and accept the fact
1646.19,that under most conditions
1647.9,unless I'm really pressed for a deadline
1649.97,"and I'm optimally caffeinated, et cetera,"
1652.13,the first five to 10
minutes,of that 90 minutes
1654.62,"are a transition time, it's"
like,"the warm up for focus,"
1657.11,but I do include it in that 90 minutes.
1659.09,And then I really try and drop into
1661.054,doing focused mental work
or,"learning of some sort,"
1664.49,"again, this could be physical"
as,"well, motor skill learning"
1667.13,"or anything, we're running or"
lifting,"weights, et cetera,"
1669.68,and really try and drop into that
1671.27,"across the full 90 minutes,"
1672.53,"again accepting the fact,"
1674.63,"okay it's not just an idea,"
1675.77,the fact that occasionally
our,"focus will flicker,"
1678.8,"it will jump out of focus,"
1680.12,and then a big part of being able to focus
1681.67,is to go back to focusing.
1683.09,The way I'd like you to
conceptualize,this perhaps
1685.4,is that arrowhead suddenly
getting,"very, very broad,"
1687.83,that you're focusing on many things
1689.09,or that arrow shifts to a
different,location in the room.
1691.913,The key is to be able to shift it back
1694.22,and to narrow it once again
and,"that's an active process,"
1696.927,so much so that it requires
a,"lot of metabolic energy,"
1700.34,your brain is the chief
consumer,of metabolic energy.
1705.113,"The calories that you consume,"
1706.607,"the so-called basal metabolic rate,"
1708.17,most of that isn't related
1709.25,"to movement or heartbeat or breathing,"
1710.69,it's related to brain function.
1712.52,Your brain is a glutton with
respect,to caloric need.
1715.88,So understand that at
the,end of 90 minutes
1717.8,"or maybe even after 45 minutes,"
1719.39,you might feel rather
tired,or even exhausted.
1722.09,And it's very important
that,after a about of focus
1725.15,that you take at least 10 minutes
1726.89,and ideally as long as 30 minutes
1728.96,and go through what I
call,deliberate defocus.
1731.6,You really want to focus
on,somewhat menial tasks
1734.21,or things that really don't require
1735.8,a ton of your concentration.
1737.489,This is starting to become
1738.92,a little bit of a movement out there
1740.54,in the kind of pop psychology
and,"optimization world,"
1743.99,this idea of not looking at your phone
1746.24,"as you walk down the hall to the bathroom,"
1747.59,certainly not looking at
your,phone in the bathroom.
1749.12,"And I should mention, by the way,"
1750.5,"this is a particular annoyance of mine,"
1752.69,have you noticed that wait times
1754.88,for restrooms in public places
1756.32,has increased substantially
in,the last 10 years?
1758.81,The reason for that is
not,"digestive, okay,"
1761.63,"it's not the gut microbiome,"
1763.16,"I mean it might be the gut microbiome,"
1764.66,but chances are
1765.493,it's because people are on
their,phones in the bathroom.
1767.03,So you're doing yourself
and,everybody else a favor
1770.03,"by staying off your phone in the restroom,"
1772.46,staying off your phone
while,walking down the hall.
1775.34,Try and give yourself some time
to,"deliberately decompress,"
1778.43,"to let your mental states idle,"
1781.19,to not be focused on any one thing.
1783.05,That period of idling
1785.15,"is essential for your ability to focus,"
1787.4,much in the same way
1788.233,that rest between sets
of,resistance training
1790.76,or rest between exercise
1792.56,is vital to being able
to,focus and perform
1795.23,during the actual sets or
during,the actual bouts
1797.78,of running or cycling
1799.19,or whatever your particular
form,of exercise might be.
1802.22,So deliberate decompression is key.
1804.35,And I know this is hard because
we're,all being drawn in
1806.78,by the incredible rich array
1810.17,of sensory information available
1811.64,"on our phones and other devices,"
1813.5,"but I can't emphasize this enough,"
1815.39,our ability to focus is not just related
1817.94,to what happens during
the,entry and movement
1820.82,through those focused bouts
but,after those focused bouts.
1823.76,We really need to deliberately decompress.
1825.53,"And of course, the ultimate decompress,"
1827.3,the time in which we are not directing
1828.83,our thinking interaction is during sleep.
1830.84,"And so it's no wonder,"
1832.25,or I should say it holds
together,"logically,"
1834.23,"that that deep, long lasting duration"
1837.44,of not controlling where our mind is at
1839.96,is in fact the ultimate
form,"of restoration,"
1842.48,even if we have very intense dreams.
1844.31,So take that period after each
90,"minute or less focus about,"
1847.73,"right, remember those focus bouts"
1848.84,"don't have to be full 90 minutes,"
1850.16,"let's say you do 45 minutes of work,"
1851.87,"you're just done with it,"
1852.703,set it down and go do
something,"for maybe five, 10,"
1855.32,maybe even 30 minutes that
is,"functional for your day,"
1858.907,"right, not just walking around in circles"
1860.96,or staring up at the sky
1861.86,"although if you can do that, do that,"
1863.69,"but most of us have other things to do,"
1865.25,but do things that are rather automatic
1866.9,"or reflexive for you,"
1868.04,"and try not to do any focused reading,"
1870.44,try not to bring your vision
into,"a tight location,"
1873.26,such as your phone and try
and,"deliberately decompress,"
1876.41,because that will allow you
1877.7,to drop into intense spouts of focus
1880.19,again repeatedly and
repeatedly,throughout the day.
1882.62,I'm often asked how many ultradian cycles
1885.14,one can perform throughout the day?
1886.76,"That depends on how well you've slept,"
1888.74,"how well you are nourished,"
1889.88,"which we'll talk about in a moment,"
1891.35,and how well trained up
your,focus capacity is.
1894.53,"And here's the paradox,"
1896.714,"if you are very trained at focusing,"
1899.54,if you're very good at
dropping,"into focus,"
1901.61,you're actually going to need
1902.78,more deliberate decompression and defocus
1904.967,"and I recommend only doing about two,"
1907.4,maybe three deep work sessions per day.
1911.09,So not one 90 minute session
than,expecting yourself
1914.12,to do to another one and
another,"one, another one,"
1915.92,but rather one deep
work,"90 minute session,"
1918.35,and maybe another in the afternoon.
1920.09,A lot of people get
surprised,"by this and say,"
1921.837,"""Wait, how many people can afford"
1923.36,"to just work three hours a day?"""
1924.65,I'm not saying just
work,three hours a day.
1926.09,I'm really talking about
the,hard mental work.
1928.34,"And again, somewhat paradoxically,"
1930.764,"the more you can concentrate,"
1932.6,"the more deeply you can concentrate,"
1934.4,the fewer deep work concentration bouts
1936.86,you can actually perform each day.
1938.33,"This makes sense, however,"
1940.46,if you think about it in the context
1941.57,of say resistance training.
1942.62,If you are stronger and
stronger,"in the gym,"
1945.38,or you're an endurance athlete
1946.73,"and you can run ultra-marathons,"
100,"miles or so,"
1950.54,you are essentially cutting a deeper cut
1953.75,into your recovery capacity
1956.0,than somebody who's not
very,skilled at those things
1958.25,or can't perform as much intense work.
1960.71,So the intensity of the
work,scales directly
1963.56,with how long you need
to,rest after that work.
1965.744,I at this stage of my life am pretty good
1968.24,at dropping into
1969.53,and maintaining focused
bouts,of concentration
1971.804,provided the landscape
of,"my life is right,"
1974.34,"you know, I don't have some"
burning,stressful thing
1975.59,that's essential or an
emergency,that I'm tending to
1978.02,and that I put my phone
away,"or turn it off,"
1980.33,I can do three 90 minute
focus,"bouts per day,"
1983.9,but that's about it.
1984.92,"And then in between those focus bouts,"
1986.9,I'm doing other things
that,require less focus.
1989.27,Some of you may be able to perform four.
1991.16,What I highly recommend
1992.18,"is that you try doing at least one,"
1994.675,that is one 90 minute or less
1997.712,about of focused
concentrated,"work per day,"
2001.48,"and yes, that means the weekends too."
2003.07,"And on the weekends, I like to read a book"
2004.737,with my phone nowhere in
"sight,","not on a device,"
2007.51,that's what I do or I'll listen
to,an audiobook sometimes
2010.33,"while taking a walk,"
2011.32,but really concentrating on
what,"I'm trying to learn,"
2013.692,what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing.
2015.91,"So again, a daily 90 minute"
about,is one to start with
2019.09,and I would say after
about,"four weeks of that,"
2020.8,if you're able to stay concentrated
2021.937,"and work through the agitation,"
2023.44,then I would consider increasing
the,number of focus bouts.
2026.59,"Again, this is not to say"
2027.643,that you should go to your teacher
2029.41,or your PhD advisor or your
parent,"or your friends and say,"
2032.687,"""Listen, I can't really"
concentrate,or think about anything
2035.11,"for more than 90 minutes per day."""
2036.73,That's not what I'm saying.
2037.57,These are deep focus bouts.
2038.89,"These are bouts of work,"
2040.66,or I should say mental
work,or physical work
2043.3,where you're really forcing
yourself,"to focus and refocus,"
2046.15,"to sharpen the head of that arrowhead,"
2047.86,to redirect it to what you're
trying,"to concentrate on,"
2049.93,and it is indeed hard work.
2051.46,I would even think about it
2052.6,more or less like a workout of any kind.
2055.18,Before we continue with
today's,"discussion,"
2056.92,we're going to take a brief pause
2058.51,to acknowledge our
sponsor,"Athletic Greens,"
2061.03,also called AG1.
2062.77,I started taking Athletic
Greens,way back in 2012
2066.1,so I'm delighted that
they've,been a sponsor
2067.93,of this podcast.
2069.49,Athletic Greens contains
"vitamins,","minerals, probiotics,"
2072.34,"digestive enzymes, and adaptogens,"
2074.79,so it's got a lot of things in there
2076.087,and that's actually the
reason,I started taking it
2077.827,and the reason I still take
it,once or twice a day.
2080.49,It essentially covers all
of,my nutritional bases
2082.96,and the probiotics in
particular,are important to me
2085.03,because of the critical importance
2086.38,"of what's called the gut brain axis,"
2087.97,that is neurons and other
cell,"types in the gut,"
2091.21,in the digestive tract that
communicate,with the brain
2093.76,and the brain back to the digestive tract
2096.01,in order to control things
like,"mood, immune function,"
2099.4,"hormone function, and on and on."
2101.38,"Whenever somebody has asked me,"
2102.82,what's the one supplement
they,"should take,"
2104.98,I always answer Athletic Greens.
2106.63,I gave that answer long
before,I ever had this podcast
2109.03,and it's the answer I still give now
2110.77,for all the reasons that I
detailed,just a moment ago.
2113.56,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,"
2114.94,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
2117.82,to claim a special offer.
2118.93,They'll give you five free travel packs
2120.34,that make it really easy
to,mix up Athletic Greens
2122.11,"while you're on the road,"
2123.1,"plus a year supply of vitamin D3+K2,"
2125.92,which are also very important
2126.97,for a huge number of bodily
factors,and brain factors
2130.24,that impact your immediate
and,long-term health.
2132.13,"Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman"
2134.77,to claim that special offer.
2136.33,I'd like to call your attention
2137.32,to a new and extremely useful tool
2139.45,for learning and applying
science,based protocols
2142.09,"for mental health, physical"
health,and performance.
2144.46,"It's called Virtusan,"
"v-i-r-t-u-s-a-n,",and it's an app.
2148.39,"And inside the app, you'll"
find,what are called journeys.
2151.18,"Each journey is aimed at a specific goal,"
2153.55,such as improving your
sleep,or tracking your sleep
2156.73,or improving your ability
to,focus and concentrate
2159.91,or improving your nutrition
or,specific exercise programs.
2164.59,The Virtusan app makes
a,lot of the protocols
2167.02,that you've seen here
2167.853,on the Huberman Lab Podcast and elsewhere
2170.11,very easy to understand
and,access and practice.
2173.02,"And in fact, it tracks your progress"
2175.06,with each of these protocols.
2176.71,I and several other researchers
2178.24,have been directly involved
2179.56,in developing the specific
journeys,and protocols
2182.02,that you'll find within the Virtusan app.
2183.79,"In fact, a lot of it involves"
direct,video tutorials from me
2187.15,and others that you'll recognize
2188.56,from social media and from podcasts.
2190.54,Everything that you'll find
within,the Virtusan app
2192.7,is geared towards giving
you,the latest science
2194.8,"in simple, straightforward protocols"
2197.17,to allow you to improve your
mental,"health, physical health"
2199.51,and performance.
2200.552,"If you want check it out,"
2201.73,you can go to the App
Store,"under Virtusan,"
2204.25,"again, that's spelled v-i-r-t-u-s-a-n,"
2207.07,or you can go to virtusan.com/huberman.
2210.55,"Again, that's virtusan.com/huberman."
2213.25,I mentioned the topic of
nutrition,"a little bit ago,"
2215.92,"and of course, nutrition"
is,a complicated topic.
2218.08,"In fact, one of the quickest ways"
2219.43,to get yourself into a battle online
2221.53,is to say something
definitive,about nutrition.
2223.9,I just want to clearly state
my,stance about nutrition.
2226.33,I fully support and applaud
2227.92,those of you that are
vegans,"for whatever reason,"
2229.72,those of you that are pure
carnivore,"for whatever reason,"
2231.91,and those of you that are
omnivores,for whatever reason.
2234.04,I happen to be an omnivore.
2235.39,"My goal is always to eat high quality,"
2237.25,minimally or non-processed foods
2239.14,and to eat things in moderation.
2240.4,So I do eat some meat
2241.96,from sustainable sources
or,"from organic sources,"
2244.72,I eat some starches and I eat
vegetables,"and I eat fruits,"
2247.9,I try not to eat sugars
2249.22,and I don't really like
highly,processed foods
2250.78,at this point in my life.
2251.8,"That's me, that's what I do,"
2253.0,but I'm certainly not dictating
what,people should eat.
2255.34,"I know certain people are ketogenic,"
2256.96,and I can say that for
people,who achieve ketosis
2260.05,"and can get into ketosis,"
2261.28,"yes indeed, there is a mental"
state,associated with ketosis
2264.82,that will allow your brain to function
2266.77,and to think really clearly
2268.06,that many people find very attractive
2269.86,and keep them going
back,over and over again
2272.14,to a ketogenic diet.
2273.43,I'm somebody who for instance
has,not been in ketosis
2276.13,"many times in my life,"
2277.03,"at least not deliberately so,"
2278.68,but I actually will ingest
liquid,ketones from time to time
2281.35,because of the further
cognitive,enhancement
2283.69,and physical enhancement that I experience
2285.31,on top of nutrition that does
include,some carbohydrates.
2288.73,So there are a lot of different
ways,"to approach all this,"
2291.1,"whether or not you're a vegan, omnivore,"
2292.81,"vegetarian, carnivore, et"
"cetera,","the point is this,"
2296.171,"your ability to focus,"
2297.76,"and in fact, your ability of neurons"
2299.65,to encode specific information
in,"your environment,"
2302.47,that is to represent what's
out,"there in the world,"
2305.14,is actually related to
your,blood glucose level.
2308.08,Now here I'm setting aside the discussion
2310.72,of ketosis and ketogenic
diets,"for the moment,"
2313.87,but there's a beautiful study
2314.89,that was published in Neuron not long ago
2316.45,"that showed that the tuning,"
2317.5,that is the precision with
which,neurons in the brain
2320.35,will represent things in our environment
2322.39,is actually much greater
2324.73,when there is sufficient
glucose,in the brain.
2327.04,"Translated into English, this"
means,that when we are fasted
2330.07,"or when our blood glucose is very low,"
2332.02,we aren't able to perceive
and,think about things
2334.84,as clearly.
2336.04,"Now there's a twist to this, however."
2337.72,Many people who practice
intermittent,"fasting,"
2339.82,and I should say
2340.653,I practice a sort of pseudo
intermittent,"fasting,"
2342.43,I generally eat my meals
2343.63,between the hours of 11:00 AM and 8:00 PM
2345.85,although sometimes there's
some,"wiggle around that,"
2347.89,"occasionally have an early breakfast,"
2349.27,"I'm not super rigid about it,"
2350.71,but I know there are a number of people
2352.03,who are doing longer fasts
2353.26,or they're eating in a six hour window.
2355.108,"We did an entire episode about fasting,"
2357.85,you can again find that
at,"hubermanlab.com,"
2359.98,"we'll likely have Satchin Panda,"
2361.75,who's an expert in intermittent
"fasting,",on the podcast.
2364.81,Intermittent fasting
2366.25,has a lot of different potential benefits.
2368.608,"For some people,"
2369.61,it's a convenient way to
restrict,their calories.
2371.47,"For other people, it's a"
convenient,"way to avoid eating,"
2373.66,that is it's easier to not eat
than,to eat a small portion
2376.3,so they opt for intermittent
fasting,and so on and so forth.
2379.87,But one of the things
that,you hear very often
2381.73,is that some people like being fasted
2383.44,because they like the clarity
of,mind that it provides.
2386.74,Here's the situation.
2388.06,"Neurons, unless you're"
in,"a ketogenic diet,"
2390.01,"really thrive on glucose,"
they,love glucose.
2393.13,"And as I mentioned before,"
2394.69,your ability to think and perceive things
2396.52,is actually enhanced
2397.87,by having sufficient
glucose,in your bloodstream.
2400.06,So why would it be that
some,people experience
2402.46,a heightened state of mental
clarity,when they are fasted?
2405.1,I've certainly experienced that before.
2406.572,"Well, I should say"
2407.5,that provided you're well hydrated enough
2409.54,and you have enough
electrolytes,"in your system,"
2411.49,what tends to happen is
that,"when you ingest food,"
2414.13,there's a shift in your nervous system
2415.66,"towards so-called parasympathetic mode,"
2417.7,"that is the more relaxed,"
2419.2,you've probably heard
it,"as rest and digest,"
2420.79,"although it does other things,"
2421.623,the more relaxed mode that can
indeed,make us very sleepy.
2424.54,"If we have too many carbohydrates,"
2425.83,it actually can make us quite sleepy.
2427.45,"However, if we have any food,"
2429.73,"if we have enough of it,"
2431.14,"that is if our gut is full,"
2432.76,it diverts blood to our gut
2434.05,and we become sleepy and
we,can't focus as well.
2436.45,So a lot of people really like fasting
2438.4,and the state of being fasted
for,focus and concentration
2441.7,because they don't have as much
2443.98,"of that parasympathetic activation,"
2445.93,they're just not as sleepy.
2446.95,"And in fact, under those conditions,"
2448.57,half as much caffeine will
give,you just as much lift
2451.33,as twice as much caffeine will give you
2453.49,on a full belly of pasta
2454.72,and that's just the way
that,caffeine interacts
2456.52,with blood glucose.
2457.36,So what I'd like you to imagine
2458.92,is if you had a measure
of,"focus from zero to 10,"
2462.31,"these are arbitrary units,"
2463.42,10 being maximally focused
2464.8,"and zero being not focused at all,"
2466.96,"imagine a U-shaped function, right,"
2470.02,"where if you're very fasted,"
2471.85,you're going to have high degree
of,"focus and concentration,"
2474.85,but then if you ingest some
food,"and your belly is full,"
2477.34,your focus and concentration is reduced.
2479.68,But having enough blood glucose
2481.916,and maybe even elevated blood glucose
2484.36,will increase cognitive function.
2485.83,So there are two ends of the spectrum.
2487.06,"On one end of the spectrum,"
2488.32,blood glucose is relatively
low,and you're fasted
2491.14,and you can think and behave
in,a very concentrated way
2494.68,"and on the other end of the spectrum,"
2496.3,you have a lot of blood
"glucose,","or I should say,"
2498.16,"sufficient blood glucose,"
2499.15,you never want your blood
glucose,"to be too high,"
2501.46,and that allows your neurons
to,encode and perceive
2505.21,and basically allow you
to,think really clearly.
2507.43,So you sort of have to
pick,your condition.
2509.5,What do you want for your bouts
of,focus and concentration?
2512.8,I actually do both.
2513.82,"So what I do is, as I mentioned before,"
2515.35,"I eat my meal sometime around 11:00 AM,"
2517.33,my first meal typically
2518.47,unless I'm very hungry when I wake up.
2520.06,And so I will do my workout
and,one about of focused work.
2524.6,I always think of this as my
hard,work early in the day
2527.53,"and I do that fasted,"
2528.94,"I'll be consuming water with electrolytes,"
2531.22,"maybe LMNT or other electrolytes,"
2532.66,maybe some caffeine as well
in,the form of yerba mate
2535.96,"or coffee, that's my first focus"
about,"of 90 minutes or less,"
2540.34,that is essentially done
fasted,and then I'll eat
2542.86,"and then I do notice after I eat,"
2544.72,I actually have a diminished
capacity,to focus.
2546.88,"But then again in the afternoon,"
2548.23,I will do another 90
minute,"about of focus,"
2550.18,and I'll talk about
some,of the tools I use
2551.71,to make sure that that
about,of focus is optimal
2554.11,for getting the most amount
of,"focused work done,"
2557.44,whether or not it's mental
work,"or physical work,"
2559.33,although I tend to do my
physical,work early in the day
2561.337,and my mental work both
early,and late in the day.
2564.55,So to make this very simple
or,as simple as I can for you
2568.33,being fasted is great for
focus,and concentration
2572.05,provided you're not thinking
about,food the entire time
2575.14,and being fed is terrific
for,"focus and concentration,"
2578.04,it actually can improve neuronal function
2580.54,provided that you didn't
eat,too much food.
2582.97,So one way to manage this
2584.98,"is if you're going to have a lunch,"
2586.24,to make sure that you don't
stuff,"yourself at lunch,"
2588.37,that you're not overeating
and,to not get quite so full
2591.73,that you put your nervous system
2593.68,into this parasympathetic mode
2595.18,and make it hard to
focus,in the afternoon.
2597.25,I know a lot of people experience a dip
2598.6,or even a crash in energy in the afternoon
2600.34,that make it really hard to focus.
2601.9,"For that reason, I'll just remind people"
2603.36,of a tool I've talked
about,"many times before,"
2605.282,which is based on the biology
2606.76,"of adenosine and caffeine, et cetera,"
2608.59,which is to delay your
first,caffeine intake
2611.11,to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.
2613.66,I know that can be painful
for,certain people.
2615.386,"I violate that rule,"
2616.87,when I'm working out very
early,in the morning.
2618.79,I'll drink my caffeine before my workout
2620.922,which often occurs within
30,to 60 minutes of waking.
2625.21,"But in general, unless I'm"
working,"out very early,"
2627.94,I will ingest my caffeine 90
to,120 minutes after I wake up.
2632.5,"So again, I want to emphasize"
2633.88,that if you hear somebody out there say
2636.16,being fasted is optimal for
focus,and concentration.
2639.64,"Well, that is true in one context"
2642.22,and perhaps ideal for a
certain,part of the day.
2644.8,"And other people will say,"
"no,","neurons run on glucose,"
2647.98,you need glucose in your bloodstream
2649.87,"in order to get those neurons to be tuned,"
2652.39,that is to respond with
electrical,activity
2654.52,in the optimal way when
you're,reading something
2656.95,or when you're trying to perform exercise.
2658.21,"Well, that's also true."
2659.29,"And of course, you can incorporate both."
2661.33,"I, in fact as I just described,"
2663.79,incorporate both fasted
states,and fed states
2667.09,in order to optimize my
concentration,and focus.
2670.93,"And as a brief note about ketosis,"
2673.21,for those of you that actually managed
2674.77,to transition into ketosis
2676.21,"and are maintaining a ketogenic state,"
2678.64,"that, as I mentioned earlier,"
2680.68,"can enhance brain function,"
concentration,and focus
2684.85,because of the way in
which,ketones can be used
2687.46,as a so-called optimal fuel for neurons.
2690.85,The ketogenic diet was
originally,"designed, if you will,"
2694.21,"for epilepsy,"
2695.47,it has a whole relationship to epilepsy
2697.0,"and controlling epileptic seizures,"
2698.71,and it can in fact allow people
2700.99,"to achieve focus,"
concentrated,brain states.
2703.33,"So in the future, I'll do"
an,episode about ketosis
2705.37,and be sure to circle back
on,how to optimize ketosis
2707.59,for focus and concentration.
2708.79,Although I have to believe
2709.78,that most of the people listening to this
2711.13,are probably not in ketosis
or,following a ketogenic diet
2714.04,so that's why I mainly focused
2715.21,on fasted states and fed states.
2718.87,"And just to make sure that I'm thorough,"
2720.73,a fasted state to me
2722.05,would be a state in which you
haven't,"ingested any calories,"
2725.23,but may have ingested caffeine
2727.09,or maybe even a small amount
of,artificial sweetener
2729.16,"or something like that,"
2730.51,but really haven't ingested
2731.95,any significant number of calories
2733.69,in the previous four to
eight,or maybe even 12 hours.
2736.87,"And again, there's"
tremendous,"variation here,"
2738.7,"depending on how long people have fasted,"
2740.41,whether or not we're
talking,about the state
2741.67,"right after people wake up, et cetera."
2743.41,"Again, if you're interested"
in,"intermittent fasting,"
2745.15,both for the sake of mental
2746.53,"and physical health and performance,"
2748.66,check out our episode on
fasting,at hubermanlab.com.
2751.24,I also want to touch back on this idea
2753.16,of which foods can increase focus.
2755.482,"You know, in the episode"
on,"ADHD that I did,"
2758.41,I touched on this quite a bit
2760.39,as it relates to elimination diets.
2762.34,There's a whole industry
2764.2,and a ton of interest for obvious reasons
2766.51,into what sorts of things kids and adults
2768.97,should and shouldn't eat
2769.9,in order to reduce symptoms of ADHD.
2772.03,I think that the sum total of
those,data point to the fact
2775.66,that reducing simple sugar intake
2777.31,"and certainly highly processed foods,"
2779.32,"so ice cream, candy, chips, et cetera,"
2782.02,"those sorts of things,"
2782.853,really does seem to
improve,symptoms of ADHD
2785.17,in both children and adults.
2786.94,But once you move past
that,"and you start to say,"
2788.95,"well, which foods can improve"
concentration,and focus?
2791.83,"Well, foods that for instance"
include,"a lot of tyrosine,"
2795.4,"which is a precursor to dopamine,"
2796.87,and now you know why dopamine
is,"important in this context,"
2800.17,are certainly going to increase
concentration,and focus.
2802.72,"So things like Parmesan cheese,"
2804.79,"certain meats, certain nuts,"
2806.02,you can look up which foods
2807.46,contain high amounts of tyrosine.
2808.93,There are also some fruits and vegetables
2810.7,"that include high amounts of tyrosine,"
2812.62,"but to be quite direct,"
2815.26,it doesn't matter whether or
not,you're ingesting foods
2819.13,that are rich in the precursor amino acids
2821.74,"to dopamine, acetylcholine, et cetera,"
2824.02,if you are consuming large
amounts,of those foods.
2827.02,"That is one can look and see for instance,"
2829.96,that a steak includes
a,lot of the precursors
2833.47,to acetylcholine.
2834.73,It has amino acid precursors
to,dopamine as well
2837.64,and there are other foods
that,"will do that as well,"
2839.53,but if I were to ingest
say,"two ribeye steaks,"
2842.56,that's a lot of meat
2844.03,and it will direct a
lot,of blood to my gut
2846.85,and it will cause me to be sleepy
2849.13,and that will create challenges of me
2851.14,being able to achieve states
of,focus and concentration.
2853.99,So the simple way to put
this,is if you eat too much
2856.57,"or you eat a very large volume of food,"
2858.67,you are going to diminish
your,focus and concentration.
2862.69,The key is to eat enough
2864.04,that you're nourished for
the,"certain activities,"
2866.56,mental and physical that
you,"need to perform,"
2868.93,"but if you're eating large meals,"
2870.52,you are going to diminish
your,concentration and focus
2873.7,period.
2874.533,I know many people are curious
as,to whether or not caffeine
2877.15,can improve focus and
"concentration,",and indeed it can.
2881.71,There is an immense amount
of,data supporting the idea
2884.98,"that caffeine,"
2885.814,provided its consumed in
the,"appropriate dosages,"
2888.25,can improve mental performance
and,"physical performance,"
2891.16,and it largely does that
2892.96,through improvements in
focus,and concentration.
2896.388,"The dosage of caffeine of course,"
2898.57,is going to depend on how
caffeine,"adapted you are,"
2901.3,how much caffeine tolerance you have.
2903.49,And that is going to vary tremendously
2905.795,depending on whether or not
you,ingest that caffeine
2908.92,"with or without food,"
as,I mentioned earlier.
2911.41,But there is a kind of general range
2913.6,in which we can talk about caffeine
2915.61,as being useful for
focus,and concentration.
2917.83,And the range is basically
2919.69,from 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams.
2922.33,"I want to caution everybody out there,"
2924.04,if you're somebody who
suffers,from anxiety
2926.47,"or panic attacks,"
2927.7,and you're not used to ingesting caffeine
2929.38,and you run out and ingest
400,milligrams of caffeine
2931.92,in the form of espresso or yerba mate
2933.97,"or an energy drink or in pill form,"
2936.4,that is going to be very
uncomfortable,"for you,"
2938.41,"you're going to be sweating profusely,"
2939.88,"your heart rate is going to increase,"
2941.14,you're going to be quite panicked in fact
2944.08,or at least anxious.
2945.46,So be cautious with your
use,and adopting of caffeine
2949.21,"if you're not already caffeine adapted,"
2951.46,but most people do quite well
2952.78,to ingest 100 to 200
milligrams,of caffeine
2955.45,prior to doing some focused work.
2957.64,"And again, I recommend"
delaying,your caffeine intake
2960.31,"to 90 to 120 minutes after waking,"
2962.47,unless you're using that caffeine
2964.33,to really jolt your
system,before a workout.
2968.17,Caffeine can of course be
ingested,"in various forms,"
2971.02,"even pill form,"
2972.04,but most people ingest
it,in the form of coffee
2973.87,or my particular favorite
way,to ingest caffeine
2976.48,is yerba mate.
2977.89,It is important and I should note
2980.05,that you should actively avoid
2982.36,the smoked versions of yerba mate
2984.01,"as they contain a lot of carcinogenic,"
2985.78,cancer promoting compounds.
2987.4,There's some great yerba
mate,brands out there.
2989.887,The most cost effective way to consume it
2992.47,would be to use the loose leaf tea
2993.85,and to pour water over that.
2995.641,"There's one particular brand that I like,"
2997.66,I don't have any affiliation
to,"them whatsoever,"
3000.09,but I've been using it
for,"years, it's Anna Park."
3002.04,It's an organic brand that is
"sold,","I buy mine on Amazon,"
3005.49,you can find it elsewhere
on,the internet as well.
3007.38,"Again, I don't have any"
affiliation,"to them,"
3009.03,"it's just very cost effective, very clean,"
3010.71,"it doesn't have the smoked flavor,"
3012.57,at least the one that I buy
is,not the smoked variety
3014.49,so none of the carcinogenic
compounds,are in there
3016.86,at least that I'm aware of
and,I like the way it tastes
3020.19,and it provides a very
even,lift and stimulant
3023.53,that I think certainly works for me
3025.62,and that a number of people I know
3026.597,that I have suggested to also enjoy.
3029.43,Yerba mate or caffeine also
have,"other additional benefits,"
3034.32,"in particular, the caffeine"
in,yerba mate and coffee
3038.01,and other sources of caffeine
3039.12,are known to increase
the,"density and efficacy,"
3042.3,that is the number and the
function,"of dopamine receptors,"
3046.71,and this has been shown
in,humans several times.
3049.35,"So by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,"
3051.3,you're actually increasing
the,ability of dopamine
3053.61,to have this effect of
increasing,motivation and drive.
3057.93,I tend to ingest caffeine
only,"early in the day,"
3060.39,I tend to cut off my caffeine intake
3061.98,somewhere around one or 2:00 PM
3063.66,to ensure that I can get
into,"a good night's sleep,"
3065.82,but I realize that there
are,people out there
3067.23,that ingest caffeine
3068.13,as late as two or three in the afternoon
3069.93,and can still sleep fine.
3071.34,I will caution those of you
3072.57,that think that you can drink caffeine
3073.92,in the evening or nighttime
and,still fall asleep.
3076.063,All of the research points to the fact
3078.54,that the architecture of your sleep
3080.01,and the depth of your sleep is disrupted.
3081.66,Even if you're able to
fall,"and stay asleep,"
3084.33,the sleep you're getting
is,simply not as good
3086.01,as the sleep you would get
3086.88,if you were to shut off
your,caffeine intake
3089.191,"at least eight hours before bedtime,"
3091.23,and ideally more like 10 or
even,12 hours before bedtime.
3093.96,"But of course, there are"
practical,constraints as well.
3096.78,Okay so caffeine is
increasing,dopamine's function
3101.01,by changing the number and
efficacy,"of dopamine receptors,"
3104.939,"but of course, it also"
increases,"our wakefulness,"
3107.13,"our alertness,"
3108.27,and that is largely through
the,neurochemical systems
3111.21,"related to adenosine,"
3112.53,which is a molecule that
builds,up in our brain and body
3114.66,"the longer we are awake,"
3115.71,it's part of the sleepiness
system,"if you will,"
3118.56,"it makes us feel fatigued or tired,"
3120.78,and caffeine also operates
on,"the epinephrine,"
3125.16,the adrenaline system.
3126.48,"In fact, if we ingest too much caffeine,"
3128.07,we'll sometimes get the jitters.
3129.84,Those jitters are really the
"sympathetic,","as it's called,"
3133.41,"nervous system's bias toward movement,"
3135.75,"and our pupils will dilate,"
they,actually get broader.
3139.47,"Now somewhat paradoxically,"
when,"our pupils get bigger,"
3143.88,"the pupils of our eyes that is,"
3145.98,"our visual world actually narrows,"
3147.84,it becomes more tunnel-like.
3149.37,A lot of people don't realize this.
3150.3,When our pupils are really
"small,",that means we are relaxed.
3152.48,So if you ever see someone
3153.36,"with really tiny or pin size pupils,"
3155.94,they're very relaxed.
3156.84,If their pupils are very
"big,","they're very dilated,"
3159.27,"well then they are very amped up,"
3162.0,"they are very, very alert."
3164.07,Caffeine increases alertness
by,"increasing epinephrine,"
3167.4,adrenaline release both in
the,brain and within the body.
3170.907,And so that's another
way,that it facilitates
3173.19,focus and concentration.
3175.244,Now there are other ways
to,increase epinephrine
3178.11,in the brain and body besides
caffeine,"or other stimulants,"
3180.99,"and in fact, that has been studied."
3182.88,There's an excellent study
3184.05,that was carried out not that
long,ago on how stress itself
3188.1,can increase our ability
to,"focus and concentrate,"
3191.19,that's right how stress itself
3192.69,can increase focus and concentration.
3194.58,"You know, most people think of stress"
3195.87,"as impairing our ability to focus,"
3198.06,but that's actually not true.
3199.29,"When we are stressed, it"
involves,"the deployment,"
3202.23,"the release of adrenaline, epinephrine,"
3204.63,and that that adrenaline both
changes,"our visual field,"
3207.93,"in other words, it narrows our vision"
3209.7,"to a more tunnel-like focus,"
3212.1,that is it makes the arrow
3213.99,"in our metaphor of the arrow more sharp,"
3217.41,and it improves our concentration.
3219.927,And this makes sense given
what,we know about stress.
3222.3,"When we're stressed,"
3223.652,we tend to be stressed
about,"a specific thing,"
3224.485,we start anticipating
or,wondering or thinking
3226.8,about what's going to happen next?
3227.85,What led up to this?
3228.81,How is this going to impact me?
3229.92,How do I feel right now?
3231.36,It really narrows the context
3233.16,of our thinking and our behavior.
3235.14,So one of my favorite studies
that,really illustrates
3237.12,how stress can improve
concentration,and performance
3240.45,is one that was published
not,that long ago
3242.067,and I will provide a link
to,this in the show notes.
3244.56,It's a paper published
3245.88,"in the ""Journal of Experimental"
"Psychology""",in 2020.
3248.82,The title of the paper
"is,","not surprisingly,"
3251.017,"""Acute stress improves"
concentration,"performance"","
3254.07,"first author DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e."
3258.3,And this study involved
taking,a number of subjects
3261.24,and stressing them out or not
3263.52,prior to a cognitive
or,concentration task.
3267.0,"And there are a lot of data in this paper,"
3268.65,but I'm just going to hone in
on,one specific set of data.
3271.74,"And I should mention as I go there,"
3273.27,that they measured things like
"cortisol,","a stress hormone,"
3275.82,"they measured anxiety, it"
was,a quite thorough study.
3278.85,And what they found was that
concentration,performance
3282.0,"improved manyfold, I should say, from,"
3285.33,there was a greater than doubling
3287.07,of concentration and
performance,in the stress group.
3290.46,And stress in this context was provided
3292.62,using a standard way of inducing stress.
3295.2,What they basically do
3296.033,is they bring subjects into the laboratory
3298.05,and they have to either do
something,fairly mundane
3301.98,in the control group
3303.15,or they have to do a
simulated,"job interview,"
3306.39,"an arithmetic task,"
3307.56,and they're being evaluated
as,they're doing this.
3309.36,So this isn't intense psychosocial stress.
3312.42,"They're not watching anything disturbing,"
3314.16,they're not being traumatized
in,any kind of way.
3315.99,This is fairly low levels of stress
3318.39,"that raised their levels of epinephrine,"
3320.67,"and we know this from this study,"
3322.56,"and their levels of cortisol,"
another,"stress hormone,"
3325.23,modestly within their brain and blood.
3328.23,But that even modest increase
in,these stress hormones
3331.35,and their reported
psychological,levels of stress
3334.59,really enhanced their
focus,and concentration.
3337.186,This may come as surprising
'cause,"like many people think,"
3340.65,"gosh, stress really diminishes"
cognitive,"performance,"
3342.81,"but that's absolutely wrong,"
3344.07,stress improves cognitive performance.
3346.47,Now of course there are other
ways,to increase stress levels
3349.35,and to do that in healthy ways
3350.58,to improve concentration and performance
3352.74,and one of the best ways to do that
3354.84,because it's so sure fire
and,it's generally safe
3358.05,provided you do it safely
is,deliberate cold exposure.
3361.68,This is something I've talked
about,"on the podcast before,"
3364.41,but deliberate cold
exposure,can be achieved
3366.27,by getting into a cold shower
for,one to five minutes.
3369.33,"If you're not used to it,"
3370.2,you probably want to
start,"with one minute,"
3371.97,"or you can get into an ice bath,"
3373.71,and nowadays there are
a,number of different
3375.03,commercial sources of
circulating,cold water
3377.16,or if you have access
to,a body of cold water
3379.83,like a lake or a pool or an ocean.
3382.26,We know that getting into
cold,water or under cold water
3386.31,greatly increases epinephrine
levels,and dopamine levels
3390.21,in the brain and blood.
3391.32,There's a beautiful
study,that was published
3392.91,in the European Journal of Physiology
3395.01,that showed that the increases
in,"dopamine are massive,"
3398.37,near doubling or more
3399.96,of dopamine levels that are
very,"long lasting for hours,"
3402.96,"and epinephrine, and"
indeed,cortisol levels
3406.11,"are also increased,"
3407.7,and in ways that support
3409.83,not just immune system
function,"because they do that,"
3413.607,"and mood because it does that,"
3415.35,but they can really improve
concentration,and focus.
3417.99,I touched on this a little
bit,in an episode about memory
3421.2,that there's an age old practice
3423.96,really dating back to medieval times
3426.03,of putting people into cold water
3428.55,right after they learn
something,"in order to spike,"
3431.49,to increase their epinephrine
3432.78,as a way to consolidate those memories.
3434.82,"For the sake of today's discussion,"
3436.38,if you are interested
3437.4,in ways to improve
focus,"and concentration,"
3440.19,"you need to increase your epinephrine,"
3443.04,your adrenaline levels.
3444.93,Cold water exposure
3446.373,is one of the most
efficient,ways to do that.
3449.538,This is not a biohack.
3451.62,"I don't like the word hack,"
3453.12,"I know it's commonly used,"
3454.38,but a hack is something
where,you're using one thing
3456.72,for a different purpose than
it,was originally intended for
3458.88,"and here, I'm not referring"
3459.96,"to the shower or the cold bath,"
3461.04,I'm referring to epinephrine.
3462.51,Epinephrine is a neurochemical
3463.86,that will place your vision
into,"more of a tunnel mode,"
3467.52,which will allow you to focus
3468.54,on cognitive work or physical
work,"in a more specific way,"
3471.48,"you're not going to be as distractable,"
3473.07,and it's very easy to achieve
3475.02,by getting into a cold shower
or,a cold body of water
3477.966,for a brief period of time.
3480.03,People always ask how long to
get,under or into cold water
3484.77,and how cold to make it.
3485.94,"Here's the thing, it should"
be,"uncomfortably cold,"
3487.89,but safe to stay in for
one,to five minutes.
3490.86,"Okay so uncomfortably cold,"
you,"really want to get out,"
3493.05,"but safe to stay in,"
3493.883,not so cold that it's going
to,give you a heart attack
3495.9,and not so warm that it's comfortable
3497.67,that it doesn't create
that,adrenaline release.
3500.07,"Cold water exposure,"
3501.24,"I should say deliberate, cold water"
3502.5,or non deliberate cold water exposure
3504.671,reliably increases epinephrine levels.
3508.05,It is incredibly useful
as,"a tool for this,"
3511.23,"and it is in fact, zero cost"
or,even negative zero cost.
3515.85,How could it be negative zero cost?
3517.14,"Well, you can certainly"
save,on your heating bill
3519.21,by taking a cold shower so that's one way.
3521.61,And for those of you that
have,access to devices
3524.16,or locations where you
can,"get into cold water,"
3526.14,"you can submerge,"
3527.13,well then that can work.
3528.45,"For those of you that don't,"
maybe,"you take a cold bath,"
3530.848,"you get in up to your neck,"
that's,going to be most efficient.
3533.19,"For those of you that can't do that,"
3534.66,you'll get under a cold shower.
3535.74,"Again, it should be comfortably cold"
3539.37,"to the point where you want to get out,"
3540.81,but that you can safely stay
in,for one to five minutes.
3544.11,How long should you do
it,before a workout?
3546.03,"Well, if you get into really cold water,"
3548.64,it's uncomfortably cold
3549.6,"and get out after about three minutes,"
3551.01,"you're probably good to go,"
dry,off and get to work.
3553.99,Some of you might think
this,is a little bit silly
3556.5,"as a tool for focus and concentration,"
3558.54,but if you look at the data on epinephrine
3561.6,"and how powerfully it can increase focus,"
3564.12,I think you'd be very impressed.
3566.04,I mean it certainly can
increase,one's ability
3568.5,"to attend to specific visual stimuli,"
3570.3,"so for reading or math work, et cetera,"
3572.7,it's going to be very useful.
3574.14,And of course you don't
want,to make it so cold
3575.49,that you're shivering and
chattering,the whole time.
3577.8,"And of course you could, if you like,"
3579.51,"combine this with 40 HZ binaural beats,"
3581.31,there's no reason
3582.143,why you couldn't combine
the,two protocols.
3584.07,But the point here is that a
lot,of people would love to
3586.86,and I think ought to leverage
3588.69,the health promoting and powerful effects
3591.33,of increasing epinephrine
on,focusing concentration
3594.54,and running out and getting
stressed,by a life event
3597.0,or getting into an argument
or,something like that
3599.19,simply as a way to increase
focus,and concentration
3601.47,doesn't seem that adaptive to me.
3603.06,So deliberate cold exposure
3604.29,"is a straightforward way to do that,"
3605.82,"it doesn't involve anyone else,"
3607.29,I suppose you could do
it,"with somebody else,"
3608.61,but it doesn't require anyone else.
3610.26,"And again, there are zero low"
3612.75,and even negative cost
ways,to approach that.
3614.97,If you'd like to know how long
3616.26,the positive effects of epinephrine last
3619.35,"toward improving focus and concentration,"
3621.57,"well, if we look to that"
study,"from DeGroote et al,"
3623.52,the acute stress improves
cognitive,"performance study,"
3625.692,they measured concentration before
3628.77,and 30 minutes after
the,stress was induced
3631.895,and there does appear to
be,"a quite long lasting,"
3634.77,really up to an hour or more effect
3637.26,of increasing epinephrine.
3639.42,So how might you apply
these,sorts of protocols
3642.18,early in the day or later in the day?
3644.55,"Well, one suggestion or one"
potential,protocol would be
3647.79,if you're going to sit
down,"and do some work,"
3649.59,if you're already feeling
alert,"and focused,"
3651.39,"no need to reach to this tool,"
3652.71,but if you're feeling like
your,focus and alertness
3655.11,"isn't quite where you'd like it to be,"
3656.73,you could take a three
minute,very cold shower
3659.01,or submerge yourself in cold
water,"for three minutes,"
3661.05,you might have a cup of coffee as well
3662.76,"and then sit down and do that work,"
3664.05,maybe even throw in the
40,HZ binaural beats.
3666.66,All of that would be layering
in,"the different systems,"
3669.78,"the different neurochemicals,"
3671.34,"such as acetylcholine,"
epinephrine,"and dopamine,"
3675.06,that are going to lend themselves
3676.08,to a really terrific 90
minute,or less work about.
3679.32,Now I'd like to discuss some
of,the purely behavioral tools
3682.17,that quality peer reviewed science say
3684.21,can improve focus and
concentration,significantly.
3687.87,"At the beginning of today's episode,"
3689.73,I talked about the study
from,Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab
3692.43,where they explored a 13 minute meditation
3695.22,done every day for a
period,of eight weeks.
3698.16,That meditation led to
significant,improvements
3700.65,"in focus and concentration ability,"
3702.84,as well as other aspects
of,cognitive performance.
3705.48,It also improved mood and reduced stress.
3708.54,So you might be wondering what
exactly,is this meditation?
3711.3,The meditation is very simple
3712.95,and it's one that anyone can perform.
3715.2,What you would want to do is set a timer
3717.39,"for about 13 minutes,"
3718.86,I don't think it has to
be,"exactly 13 minutes,"
3720.81,but since that's what they
included,"in the study,"
3722.986,you would set a timer for 13 minutes.
3725.73,You would sit or lie
"down,","close your eyes,"
3729.12,and you would simply
focus,on your breathing.
3732.24,Most people are going to benefit
3733.5,from only doing that
breathing,"through their nose,"
3735.9,but if you have some sort of obstruction
3738.09,or inability to breathe
just,"through your nose,"
3739.71,you could probably also do it
3740.76,by breathing through your nose
and,mouth or just your mouth.
3743.43,But ideally you would
do,just nasal breathing
3745.89,"for a period of 13 minutes,"
3747.18,"concentrating on that breathing,"
3748.86,"and concentrating, meaning"
bringing,"your awareness,"
3752.22,your so-called interoceptive awareness
3754.41,if you wanted to get
really,"technical about it,"
3757.05,your interoceptive awareness
3758.76,to a point just about an
inch,inside of your forehead.
3762.24,"Now, of course,"
3763.073,that might sound kind
of,"gory to some of you,"
3764.954,you've never actually
been,"inside your forehead,"
3767.88,but just about an inch
behind,your forehead
3770.22,is where you would want to
place,your concentration
3772.35,while also concentrating
on,your breathing.
3774.81,Now here's the thing about meditation
3776.97,"that all studies of meditation show,"
3779.82,which is that unless you are
a,"very experienced meditator,"
3784.08,"your concentration, your focus"
3786.03,will drift away from your breathing
3788.76,and away from that location
about,"an inch inside your head,"
3793.2,"inside your brain, about"
just,behind your forehead.
3797.011,That will happen maybe every
10,"seconds, every 20 seconds,"
3800.94,"maybe even every five seconds,"
3802.65,but an important part of
such,a meditation practice
3805.68,to improve concentration and focus
3807.63,is that you are continually refocusing
3810.775,back to that specific location
3812.7,and refocusing back on your breath.
3815.115,"This is something that again,"
is,not often discussed.
3817.92,People think that if you do a meditation
3819.54,and you're supposed to
concentrate,"on your breath,"
3821.4,that if your mind drifts
3822.45,that somehow you failed
in,"that meditation,"
3824.34,but actually that's not the case.
3826.17,A huge component of improving your ability
3829.65,to focus and concentrate
by,"way of neuroplasticity,"
3832.74,rewiring of the circuits
for,"focus and concentration,"
3835.86,is the repeated return to a state of focus
3839.52,from a state of non-focus
or,diminished focus.
3843.21,So think about it like trying
to,drive down the freeway
3846.239,and staying between the
lane,"lines, excuse me."
3849.51,"And every once in a while,"
3850.59,because there's a bit
of,"drift on the vehicle,"
3853.05,maybe the wheels aren't aligned correctly
3854.49,or there's something else
wrong,with the chassis
3856.32,"or the steering device,"
3857.34,"it starts to drift right a little bit,"
3859.08,"then you hit the rumble strip to go rrrr,"
3860.67,and then you pull back to the center.
3862.38,That's really what a focused
meditation,practice is about
3865.89,as opposed to expecting yourself
3868.35,to stay between the mental
lane,"lines, so to speak."
3871.35,So if you're somebody who's
going,to do a practice
3873.45,"of the sort that I described,"
3874.77,"13 minute meditation practice every day,"
3877.35,you'd want to sit or lie
"down,","close your eyes,"
3879.36,"start to concentrate on your breath,"
3880.74,focus your attention
3882.3,on a location about an
inch,"behind your forehead,"
3885.27,"and then fully expect that at some point,"
3888.12,"you'll be thinking about something else,"
3889.83,and that's a cue to focus
back,to that location
3892.83,just about an inch behind your forehead
3894.27,and back to your breath.
3896.22,"By doing that repeatedly over and over,"
3897.78,what you're really training up
3899.4,is the network within your brain
3902.16,that indeed includes
that,prefrontal cortex
3904.56,that you're focusing on as
well,"as some other structures,"
3906.6,"the inferior temporal cortex,"
indeed,"the hippocampus,"
3909.24,"a structure associated with memory,"
3910.89,and other components of the neural circuit
3913.23,that are involved in directing
3914.88,our mental focus and concentration.
3917.1,"Again, I can't emphasize the importance"
3919.44,of this practice being one
of,focusing and refocusing.
3922.89,"In fact, I would prefer"
to,"call such a practice,"
3925.17,"a refocus focused meditation,"
or,"a constantly refocusing,"
3929.61,or maybe you all can come up
with,"a better name for it,"
3931.95,I'm certainly not that
good,"at naming things,"
3933.87,but this sort of meditation practice
3936.03,has been shown
3936.863,in the study by the Suzuki
lab,and other studies
3939.727,to really improve people's ability
3942.72,"to focus and remain focused,"
3945.3,so much so that in the beautiful
"book,","""Altered States,"""
3949.14,they describe a number of
different,"meditation practices,"
3951.45,some a little bit longer than
the,"one that I described,"
3954.75,"one that's 17 minutes,"
another,"one that's 30 minutes,"
3957.03,some people will meditate
as,"long as 60 minutes a day,"
3959.01,although that's quite a
long,"time, in my opinion."
3961.08,The point here isn't how long you focus
3963.84,or somehow trying to achieve total focus
3966.87,for the entire 13 minute or 17 minute
3969.72,or 60 minute about of meditation.
3972.39,While that would be wonderful
3973.74,"and I think many people aspire to do that,"
3975.81,that's a lot of hard mental work.
3977.31,I think for most people out
"there,","including myself,"
3979.71,a relatively short meditation
practice,of about 13 minutes
3984.18,in which you fully expect
3986.401,"your focus and concentration to drift,"
3988.74,but that you are continually refocusing
3990.63,"is going to be the most effective,"
3992.52,"yes, indeed, the most effective"
3994.32,at teaching yourself to
focus,and stay concentrated.
3997.74,"In fact, I invite you to interpret"
3999.63,every time that you
focus,off that location
4002.93,"about one inch behind your forehead,"
4004.85,as an opportunity to refocus
4006.35,and think about the
refocusing,as the trigger
4009.29,for teaching your neural circuits
4011.0,how to focus for extended periods of time.
4013.61,And as a bonus to that sort
of,"meditation practice,"
4015.773,the study from Wendy Suzuki's lab
4017.93,also showed that people
experience,improvements in sleep
4021.14,"and improvements in memory,"
4022.58,so not just improvements in
mood,and reduction in stress
4025.04,and improvements in
focus,"and concentration,"
4027.44,but all these other positive benefits
4029.12,from just doing that 13 minute
a,day meditation practice.
4032.24,It's one that I've started to adopt
4034.07,and have felt tremendous benefit from
4035.477,and that I encourage many
of,you to try as well.
4038.18,The one cautionary note
4039.26,is the one that I mentioned at
the,"beginning of the episode,"
4041.18,which is because the refocus
as,"I'll call it, meditation,"
4045.95,does involve a significant
amount,of effort
4048.5,and engagement of these
prefrontal,"cortical circuits,"
4051.08,it is disruptive to sleep if
performed,too closely to sleep.
4055.04,"So if you are going to do that practice,"
4056.66,I recommend that you not do it
4058.4,within the four hours
prior,to your bedtime.
4060.8,Earlier I mentioned
4061.633,that I would talk about
ways,to improve focus
4063.682,if you are sleep deprived.
4065.45,This is something that
I'm,all too familiar with.
4067.76,I put a lot of effort
into,"optimizing my sleep,"
4070.25,that's something that
with,"each passing year,"
4071.84,"I put more and more effort into,"
4073.37,"again, because sleep is so vital"
4074.93,"for mental health, physical health"
4076.31,"and performance of all kinds,"
4078.08,"but certainly in my role as a student,"
4080.84,in my role as a professor
and,"in my role in life,"
4083.93,I've had numerous times
4085.85,in which I simply did not get enough sleep
4087.92,or my sleep was terrible
for,"whatever reason,"
4090.98,and yet I still had work
demands,"and social demands,"
4093.53,et cetera.
4095.3,One practice that is very effective
4097.07,at allowing you to focus
4098.78,better than you would otherwise
4100.97,under conditions of sleep deprivation
4103.01,is so called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.
4106.28,This is also referred to
sometimes,as yoga nidra.
4109.1,Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.
4111.11,Yoga nidra is a practice of
lying,down for about 10 to 30
4115.19,"sometimes even as long as 60 minutes,"
4117.26,"you listen to a script,"
it's,"an audio script,"
4119.72,that takes you through a
progressive,"deep relaxation,"
4122.39,"it involves a body scan,"
4123.77,some long exhale breathing.
4125.24,It is very restorative in the
sense,that one tends to emerge
4128.6,from yoga nidra or NSDR
feeling,greatly refreshed
4131.62,compared to how you felt prior to it.
4134.9,There is also terrific neuroimaging data
4137.27,from laboratories in Denmark
4139.85,showing that there's a
restoration,of dopamine levels
4142.28,in the so-called basal ganglia
after,NSDR AKA yoga nidra.
4146.48,Whether or not you call
it,"yoga nidra or NSDR,"
4149.21,which is what I refer to
it,"as, non-sleep deep rest,"
4151.85,you can find these scripts at
zero,cost in multiple places.
4155.39,You can find there are
certain,apps that are NSDR
4157.99,or yoga nidra apps.
4160.04,There is a NSDR protocol
4162.106,that was put out there by
Madefor,which is on YouTube
4165.56,that you can access for free.
4167.15,There is a NSDR or I should
say,a number of NSDR protocols
4171.05,through the Virtusan app.
4172.85,"There are, again, number"
of,different places
4174.71,that one can access NSDR protocols.
4177.71,I do NSDR for 10 to 30 minutes
per,"day every single day,"
4182.24,not just on days where I'm sleep deprived.
4184.52,"If I happen to be sleep deprived,"
4185.84,I would extend that NSDR
to,30 or 60 minutes.
4189.29,And when you do that NSDR
4190.76,will depend on when you
have,time for that NSDR.
4193.4,"When I haven't slept well,"
4194.33,what I'll try and do is find a quiet place
4196.34,where I can do NSDR for
30,or ideally 60 minutes.
4199.927,Sometimes I will fall back
asleep,"during that NSDR,"
4202.58,"that's fine if you do that,"
4204.74,but most people will stay
awake,"during the NSDR,"
4207.484,and then I'll emerge from
that,and go about my day.
4210.26,"If in the afternoon,"
4211.49,I'm very fatigued
because,"of lack of sleep,"
4213.32,I might do another NSDR
of,"10 to 30 or 60 minutes,"
4217.52,and then another work about.
4218.84,"Again, NSDR is something I do every day."
4221.42,I talked a lot about this in
the,"episodes related to sleep,"
4224.24,because it can help you get better
4225.56,at falling and staying asleep at night
4228.02,in addition to feeling restorative
4230.99,in that immediate timeframe of the day
4232.7,"in which you do NSDR,"
4233.96,so it's immensely
beneficial,at various times
4235.97,and for various purposes.
4237.53,But here within the context
4239.06,of trying to concentrate and focus
4240.53,"when you're sleep deprived,"
4242.3,"NSDR, AKA yoga nidra is an"
immensely,beneficial practice.
4246.92,There's growing amounts of quality science
4249.41,pointing to the neurochemical
replenishing,"effects,"
4252.77,"as I mentioned before, dopamine,"
4254.45,but also the potential for NSDR
4257.33,to replace sleep that you've lost.
4259.28,I would never want anyone
to,try and use NSDR
4261.22,"as a total replacement for sleep,"
4263.12,but under conditions in which
you,"cannot control your sleep,"
4265.91,NSDR is going to be the
best,way that I am aware of
4268.64,to restore your ability
to,focus and concentrate
4271.67,for whatever purpose.
4273.08,And if you emerge from your NSDR
4274.85,"and then drink some caffeine,"
4275.93,you'll notice an even greater capacity
4278.34,for focus and concentration
4280.19,for all the reasons directly
related,to caffeine.
4282.71,"So again, NSDR is a general tool"
4285.71,for enhancing your ability to sleep
4287.827,and it's a tool that you can use
4289.76,"in order to compensate for,"
at,"least to some degree,"
4292.88,compensate for lost sleep
4294.74,when you need to focus and concentrate.
4296.66,One thing that really
contrasts,NSDR and yoga nidra
4299.84,with the sort of focused meditation
4301.7,"that I talked about a few minutes ago,"
4302.99,"the 13 minute meditation,"
4304.76,"is that during the 13 minute meditation,"
4306.65,you're actively trying
to,"refocus and focus,"
4308.93,"whereas during NSDR and yoga nidra,"
4310.67,you're actually trying to defocus.
4312.77,So you can think of the
13,minute meditation
4314.81,for refocusing and focusing
4316.73,as directly tapping into and mediating
4320.45,improvements in the circuitry
for,focus and concentration
4322.94,whereas you can think
of,NSDR and yoga nidra
4325.97,as modulating your brain and body state
4328.79,to allow you to focus
and,concentrate better.
4332.21,Now another tool that you can use
4334.04,to directly tap in
4335.11,to the circuits for
focus,and concentration
4337.25,and to greatly accelerate
"neuroplasticity,","the improvements,"
4342.02,or I should say the
changes,in those circuits
4343.79,that will allow you to
focus,and concentrate better
4346.16,is hypnosis.
4347.24,A lot of people hear hypnosis
and,"they think stage hypnosis,"
4349.64,"you know, people squawking like chickens"
4351.02,"and doing things against their will,"
4352.61,but actually hypnosis is a atypical
4355.94,but highly accessible brain state
4357.47,that's been studied with a lot of rigor
4360.072,at Stanford University School of Medicine
4362.63,"by my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,"
4364.34,he's been a guest on
this,podcast previously.
4366.53,Hypnosis is a unique brain state
4368.21,because it's one in which
you,are deeply focused
4371.06,and yet deeply relaxed.
4372.62,So to just sort of set up
the,array of practices here
4375.14,"so you can think about them logically,"
4376.88,the focus refocus meditation
4378.53,is based on and focused
on,"focus, no pun intended."
4382.58,NSDR and yoga nidra are
aimed,at deep relaxation.
4386.78,"Hypnosis is this atypical,"
very,powerful brain state
4390.38,in which you combine high levels of focus
4393.26,and deep relaxation.
4395.31,Now it's a little bit of a tough one
4396.89,"to just take oneself into,"
4398.51,"but fortunately, there's a tool"
4400.01,based on a lot of quality
peer-reviewed,research
4402.2,from the Spiegel lab and other labs
4403.67,"and that is the Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i."
4406.64,"The Reveri app is available for no cost,"
4410.24,at least for a period of time
4411.073,and then I think they place
certain,elements of it
4413.45,"behind a pay wall,"
4414.62,"but you can try at zero cost,"
4417.08,"it's available for Apple,"
4418.13,soon I think also to be
available,"for Android,"
4420.65,and they have specific hypnosis protocols
4423.32,"that you listen to, and these"
are,"very brief protocols,"
4425.997,"follow the instructions,"
4427.97,you're listening to a
particular,audio script
4429.74,"of David Spiegel himself,"
4431.45,and some progressive breathing
4433.01,and actually some eye movements
4434.6,that are directly linked
to,the neural circuits
4436.82,that allow for these highly
"focused,",deeply relaxed states.
4439.76,And there are components
within,the Reveri app
4442.16,specifically geared
4443.09,towards improving focus and concentration.
4446.0,"So again,"
4447.2,"there's meditation for focus,"
4448.94,there's deliberate
"decompression,","NSDR, yoga nidra,"
4451.97,"which take you into deep relaxation,"
4453.53,and then hypnosis is this very
"special,",very directed state
4457.61,"of highly focused and highly relaxed,"
4460.88,"or I should say deeply relaxed,"
4462.47,that allow access to the neural circuits
4464.66,for focus and concentration
4466.37,and allow you to tune those
up,and to improve those
4469.16,very significantly in a
very,brief amount of time.
4472.04,"And again, some of those hypnosis scripts"
4473.9,"are as short as eight minutes,"
4475.1,some are as long as 13 minutes.
4476.87,So what we're really talking
about,here are zero cost tools
4480.14,that directly tap into
the,"neural circuits,"
4482.54,"the components within your brain,"
4484.13,"that allow for deep relaxation,"
allow,"for deep focus,"
4487.52,and improve your ability to
focus,and concentrate over time
4491.03,simply by repeating these.
4493.01,How often do you need to
repeat,the Reveri hypnosis
4496.7,for focus and concentration
before,you see benefits?
4498.95,"Well, that will vary"
from,person to person.
4500.919,I tend to use it once
every,third or fourth day
4503.99,and have experienced
tremendous,benefits from it.
4506.264,"I don't think I'm unique in that sense,"
4508.07,they have a lot of data
to,support this Reveri app
4510.86,and the protocols within it.
4512.898,How long do you have to do NSDR
4515.21,before you experience those benefits?
4516.68,"There, I would say the"
first,"time and every time,"
4518.33,because it's so deeply relaxing
4519.86,that you emerge from it
feeling,quite restored
4521.99,relative to how you went into it.
4523.653,And as I mentioned earlier
in,"the study on meditation,"
4527.0,it took about eight weeks
4527.9,to see the effects that
they,"observed in that study,"
4530.48,but they didn't observe
shorter,time points.
4532.46,So I highly encourage
people,to explore meditation
4536.03,"geared towards focus and refocus,"
4537.44,"also NSDR, nonsleep deep"
"rest,","AKA yoga nidra,"
4540.59,"and the Reveri app,"
4541.61,Specifically the hypnosis
within,"the Reveri app,"
4544.242,that's geared towards improving
focus,and concentration.
4547.34,All of these have terrific
science,"to support them,"
4549.74,this is not woo science or hacks
4552.11,or just something that
people,came up with.
4553.88,This is all grounded in work
4555.47,from some of the best
universities,"in the world,"
4558.17,from excellent groups
4559.58,who've looked at underlying
neural,mechanisms
4561.44,"and measured things with a lot of rigor,"
4563.15,"et cetera, et cetera."
4564.14,"These tools are available to you,"
4565.4,I highly recommend that you use them.
4567.53,And if you're interested
4568.37,"in the optimal time of day to do these,"
4570.47,we already mentioned that
the,focus refocus meditation
4574.4,"shouldn't be done too close to sleep,"
4576.44,the Reveri hypnosis app can
be,"done at any time really,"
4580.58,"in fact, there's a component"
4581.96,"of falling back of sleep in there,"
4583.67,"in other words, a hypnosis"
specifically,geared
4585.41,toward helping people teach
themselves,to fall back asleep
4587.96,when they wake up in
the,middle of the night.
4589.43,"NSDR, I always say,"
4590.6,can be done first thing in
the,"morning, in the afternoon"
4592.64,"or any time of day,"
4593.54,"and in fact,"
4594.373,I'll sometimes do that in
the,middle of the night
4595.52,if I happen to wake up and
need,to get back to sleep.
4598.1,So really these tools can be
applied,"most any time of day,"
4601.34,except for that one caveat
4602.81,about the focus refocus meditation
4604.58,not being done too close to sleep.
4606.53,Now there's another
set,of behavioral tools
4608.48,that can really help enhance
one's,ability to focus
4611.42,and those are visual based tools.
4613.614,"In fact, the tools I'm about to describe"
4615.83,are actually being employed
in,a number of schools
4618.77,in China and elsewhere in
order,to teach children
4621.68,to focus better and for
longer,periods of time.
4625.67,The key principle here is that
much,"of our cognitive focus,"
4630.59,our ability to think about
something,in a very specific way
4633.11,"and stay focused on it,"
4634.55,to read or to follow
a,line of conversation
4638.09,"or math or music, et cetera,"
4640.25,is going to be directed
by,our visual system.
4644.03,Our visual system has two
forms,of attention and focus.
4646.52,"One is overt focus, which"
is,very straightforward.
4649.43,"If I'm looking at the tip of my pen,"
4650.78,"for those of who are listening right now,"
4651.8,I'm looking at the tip of
my,"pen, that's overt focus,"
4653.84,"I'm focusing on it with my eyes,"
4655.61,"and of course, the rest of"
my,brain then will follow
4658.22,and start to analyze the
details,of what I'm seeing
4660.377,"and the contours of the pen, et cetera."
4662.63,It seems sort of obvious
when,"you first hear it,"
4664.67,but our cognitive focus tends to follow
4667.22,our overt visual focus.
4669.53,That's also why they
put,blinders on horses.
4671.78,That's also why sometimes
wearing,a hoodie or a hat
4674.96,or limiting your visual field in some way
4677.301,"can help you enhance your cognitive focus,"
4680.14,it can help limit distraction.
4681.65,You're just not seeing as much.
4683.87,It's also why when we ingest caffeine
4685.7,or any kind of stimulant
or,we are stressed
4687.59,and our pupils dilate
4688.91,"and our vision becomes more tunnel-like,"
4690.56,"less panoramic, but more tunnel-like,"
4692.42,you know they say a soda
straw,view of the world
4694.22,"or you're looking through a tunnel,"
4695.794,"your focus, your visual focus"
4698.15,is actually driving your cognitive focus.
4699.92,Your cognitive focus is
narrower,than it would be
4703.1,if you were seeing the
whole,scene that you're in.
4704.96,"So when you hear this, it sounds obvious,"
4706.4,"but for many people,"
including,"many scientists,"
4708.62,it's just not obvious that
this,would be the case.
4710.42,"However, that is the case,"
4711.89,your visual focus drives
your,cognitive focus.
4714.8,So what is a practice
4716.48,that has been studied
in,various laboratories
4719.57,and that's being employed
in,various schools?
4721.19,Is to have children or adults
visually,focus on one location
4726.98,for a given period of time.
4728.57,How long?
4729.56,"Anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes,"
4732.29,"and believe it or not,"
4733.123,three minutes is a long time
4733.956,to maintain visual focus at one location.
4736.666,"If you were to try that right now,"
4738.14,you'd probably find it
to,"be a bit of a strain,"
4740.15,"but if you want to try it, you can."
4741.8,"Keep in mind, you yes,"
are,"allowed to blink,"
4745.1,but also keep in mind that
meditation,refocusing practice
4748.7,"that we talked about earlier,"
4750.29,that the refocusing is the key component
4753.56,"of teaching yourself or your brain,"
4755.841,"you are your brain, your brain is you,"
4757.43,but to teach yourself how to focus better.
4759.86,So if you're going to
incorporate,"this practice,"
4763.19,what you would want to
do,"is pick a location,"
4765.35,"it could be on a wall,"
4766.46,it could be on your
computer,"in front of you,"
4768.23,although I would encourage it
4769.13,to not be the contents
of,"your computer screen,"
4771.02,"you might just want to blank your screen,"
4772.67,you might want to put a piece of paper
4773.87,"with a crosshatch there,"
any,"sort of visual target,"
4776.66,or you can imagine a visual target
4778.1,and then focus your visual
attention,on that target
4780.5,"and try to breathe normally,"
try,"and stay relaxed,"
4783.02,and certainly allow yourself to blink
4784.43,so that your eyes don't try out.
4785.87,This is not a test of how long
you,can go without blinking.
4789.23,By focusing on that particular location
4791.9,and by forcing yourself to
refocus,on that location
4794.45,"anytime your gaze, your vision"
drifts,"from that location,"
4798.77,you are encouraging the circuits for focus
4802.13,to get better at focusing
for,longer and longer
4804.35,and at refocusing when your focus
4806.21,drifts off of that location.
4808.04,"This is incorporating neural circuits,"
4809.6,"including the prefrontal cortex,"
4811.04,things like the frontal eye fields.
4812.57,For those of you curious
about,"the underlying biology,"
4814.748,this practice is
recruiting,certain elements
4818.0,"of your so-called prefrontal cortex,"
4819.5,"also the frontal eye fields,"
4821.48,which are locations not far
from,"the prefrontal cortex,"
4824.15,that are involved in
deliberately,directing your gaze
4826.64,"to particular locations in space,"
4829.19,"not outer space,"
4830.09,although you could do this by
focusing,"on stars I suppose,"
4832.82,but in visual space.
4835.1,Now I mentioned before
4836.48,that this is overt visual
focus,"and attention,"
4839.87,"you are overtly looking at that location,"
4842.03,but one also very powerful practice
4844.4,for improving focus and concentration
4848.06,is to use covert focus.
4850.61,"Covert focus is where my gaze,"
4853.19,my eyes are focused on one
"location,","such as my pen,"
4856.31,but my focus is actually directed
4858.77,elsewhere in the room
or,location that I'm in.
4861.5,My mind and to some extent
my,peripheral vision
4865.58,is focused in this case on
the,door just to my left
4868.13,in the room that I'm in.
4869.36,That takes a little bit more effort.
4870.74,This is something that
all,"old world primates,"
4872.75,of which we are old world
"primates,",are able to do.
4875.63,And it probably evolved
as,part of the mechanism
4878.03,by which animals could
evaluate,"their scene,"
4881.87,"evaluate predators,"
evaluate,other primates
4885.8,while not necessarily
staring,at them directly
4888.62,"so they can obtain information,"
4890.33,we can obtain information
without,having to direct our gaze
4892.88,specifically to one location.
4894.23,Maybe we can obtain information
from,"multiple locations,"
4897.14,"indeed, we can."
4898.79,Without getting too far
down,the rabbit hole
4901.46,"of how vision and cognition relate,"
4904.64,because we've done episodes
on,"that previously,"
4906.897,and simply focusing on the
tools,that can be incorporated
4911.72,"to improve focus and concentration,"
here's,what I recommend.
4915.14,Set yourself a low bar
at,first and set a timer
4920.06,and try to focus on one
location,for 30 seconds
4923.57,and that's it for that day.
4925.13,"The next day, you might add five seconds,"
4927.17,"and then the next day,"
five,seconds after that.
4929.3,"If you miss a day, no big deal,"
4931.19,simply do the practice for
the,same amount of time
4934.52,that you did the last time
that,"you did the practice,"
4936.68,and then gradually try and
increase,the amount of time
4939.8,that you can focus on one
visual,location overtly
4943.1,by looking directly at that location.
4945.261,"If you like, and if you"
feel,"you have the ability,"
4948.02,you can try and do this through
covert,attention and focus
4950.87,"by looking straight forward for instance,"
4952.76,and attending to something
in,the corner of the room
4954.56,"and trying to do that for 30 seconds,"
4956.78,you'll find that that's
quite,"a bit harder,"
4958.46,and then extending that by five seconds
4960.56,every time you do the practice.
4962.36,This is something that I
don't,think you necessarily
4964.28,have to build up to being
able,to do for a full hour
4966.35,in order to extract the benefits.
4967.76,"In fact, the best way to"
think,about this practice
4970.52,is as a means to get into a focused state.
4973.4,If you remember back
about,"an hour or so ago,"
4976.64,I was talking about how focused states
4979.04,are not a drop all the way in
and,then exit type phenomenon.
4983.51,We don't just drop into a focused state
4985.19,the same way we don't drop
into,the peak performance
4987.17,"of a workout, we warm up."
4988.85,So what I recommend is having a 30 second
4992.45,to three minute period at the
beginning,of a about to focus
4997.58,where you're going to
do,work or physical work
4999.59,and anchoring your vision to one location
5003.49,somewhere in the room
5004.81,or if you want to do it
"covertly,","you can do that,"
5006.85,setting a timer and trying to do that
5008.5,for anywhere from 30
seconds,to three minutes.
5010.72,What you're doing when
you,exercise that practice
5014.98,is you are ramping up neural activity
5018.16,within the neural circuits
5019.69,that create focus and concentration.
5021.91,"Then, I would stop"
looking,at that location
5024.52,or that covert location
5025.72,and then I would move to the
work,"that you're trying to do,"
5027.52,either mental work or physical work.
5029.71,And if about halfway
through,your 90 minute about
5032.47,or at some point in your 90
minute,"about of work or exercise,"
5035.2,you feel that your
concentration,is drifting
5037.09,rather than look at your phone
5038.38,and scroll through the
thousands,of contexts
5041.08,that exists within social
media,"or your phone,"
5043.39,try just picking a
location,"again on the wall,"
5045.79,"focusing back on that location,"
5047.68,using that as a ramp up
5049.78,"to then direct your focus back towards,"
5051.91,"if your weight training,"
5052.743,sets and reps that you
might,"be performing,"
5054.13,"if you're running,"
5055.0,"you might do this, or"
cycling,you might do this
5058.0,by focusing on a particular location
5059.71,and really homing in on
that,location physically.
5062.543,And this is a practice that a
lot,"of athletes use in fact,"
5065.38,and if you're say doing
musical,"practice or math,"
5068.5,"well then, you'd want"
to,focus on something
5070.21,other than the task that
you're,trying to perform.
5072.52,"But again, using visual focus"
5074.5,as a way to ramp up and
increase,your overall ability
5078.16,"to focus and concentrate,"
5079.54,and then applying that to whatever it is
5081.46,that you're trying to learn or perform.
5083.5,"Next, I'd like to talk about compounds"
5085.09,"that can improve concentration and focus,"
5087.192,and these are most often
consumed,"as supplements,"
5090.13,"although some of them, I should mention,"
5091.72,can also be derived from food.
5094.03,"Again, I just want to remind you"
5095.363,"that there are things,"
in,"this case compounds,"
5097.99,"that can modulate a biological mechanism,"
5100.66,that is can modulate
focus,"and concentration,"
5103.42,"and there are compounds that can mediate,"
5106.75,can directly contribute to
concentration,and focus.
5110.723,One of the key compounds
5112.6,that supports concentration and focus
5114.88,because it generally supports
"mood,",concentration and focus
5118.39,and brain function in general
5120.82,are the omega-3 essential fatty acids.
5123.34,I've talked about the
omega-3,essential fatty acids
5125.92,"in a variety of contexts,"
in,"particular depression,"
5127.84,"but also ADHD, there are"
interesting,"data on that,"
5131.287,and it's really clear
5132.441,that getting somewhere between
one,"and three grams of EPA,"
5136.564,that is one to three grams
5137.824,of EPA essential fatty acid
per,"day can improve outcomes,"
5143.02,that is can improve mood and
can,improve cognitive function.
5146.74,And while there's some debate
5147.579,about whether or not it can
improve,"cardiac function,"
5150.67,"it's very clear, at least to me,"
5152.74,that ingesting one to three grams
5154.87,of EPA essential fatty
acid,per day is beneficial.
5157.99,"But again, in the context"
of,"focus and concentration,"
5160.93,it's in modulating the neural
circuits,and brain function
5164.83,that are going to support
focus,and concentration.
5167.14,It's not as if taking one to three grams
5169.75,of EPA essential fatty acid per day
5172.09,is going to tap directly into
5174.58,only the circuits for
focus,and concentration.
5177.94,"That said, and as discussed on the episode"
5180.73,of the Huberman Lab Podcast
with,"Dr. Rhonda Patrick,"
5183.58,"and on the episode on ADHD that I did,"
5186.824,and on the episode on
depression,"that I did,"
5188.59,I make it a point to
ingest,one to three grams
5191.35,of EPAs per day.
5193.57,You can get those EPAs
5195.76,from other sources besides
"supplements,","of course,"
5199.0,but supplements are going to
be,the easiest way to do that.
5201.22,"You could do that through liquid form,"
5202.63,"fish oil, cod liver oil,"
5204.22,some people who are vegan opt
for,"other sources of EPAs,"
5207.22,you can find those out there certainly.
5208.81,Some people even use prescription EPAs
5210.67,to get the dosage really high.
5213.1,Dr. Ronda Patrick talked about
this,"in the episode with me,"
5215.71,that's actually something that she does.
5217.15,"I don't take the prescription form,"
5218.44,I get them through pill form
5220.39,through our supplement
"affiliate,","which is Momentous,"
5223.6,but there are a number of
different,quality sources
5225.94,of EPAs out there.
5227.424,And some of those quality
sources,also include things
5229.9,"like fatty fish, algae,"
and,things of that sort.
5232.63,So I'll leave it to you as to
whether,or not you supplement
5234.88,with omega-3 fatty acids
5236.29,in order to get that one
to,three grams per day
5237.94,"or whether or not you do it through food,"
5239.44,but I would encourage you to
try,and reach that threshold
5242.172,because there are a number
of,known positive effects
5245.41,for mood and brain function generally.
5247.66,The other thing that can
positively,modulate brain function
5251.02,and that actually works as a
fuel,for neurons to function
5255.1,"and can improve cognitive performance,"
5256.72,and particularly within
the,"brain circuits,"
5258.88,"such as the prefrontal cortex,"
5260.17,that are involved in concentration
and,focus is creatine.
5263.29,I know many people are familiar
with,creatine monohydrate
5265.87,for its effects on muscle growth
5268.42,"and strength and performance,"
5270.1,but it's quite clear that the
bulk,of scientific studies
5272.59,have examined the role of
creatine,in the clinical context
5275.68,and as its role in improving
cognitive,performance.
5278.5,So my read of the literature
has,led to a practice
5280.66,in which I ingest five grams per day
5283.03,"of creatine monohydrate,"
5284.65,the sort of standard
form,"that's available in,"
5287.47,"this is generally available as a powder,"
5289.39,that's certainly how I take it.
5290.223,"I'll take the creatine powder,"
5291.94,I'll mix it with water or
with,my Athletic Greens
5294.31,"or some sort of electrolyte drink,"
5296.08,whatever liquid happens to be
convenient,"to ingest that in,"
5298.93,the time of day doesn't
really,seem to be important.
5300.82,Some people are strong believers
5301.99,in consuming creatine post-workout.
5305.14,"While that might be beneficial,"
5306.46,I simply take it in the
morning,"or post-workout,"
5309.73,it sort of depends on when
I,"remember to take it,"
5312.31,"but that five grams of creatine per day,"
5314.74,"in my case, really isn't"
geared,towards muscle growth
5317.26,or strength or performance
5318.76,as much as it's geared toward
5320.35,tapping into the creatine
phosphate,system within the brain
5323.62,and specifically the benefits of creatine
5326.92,for prefrontal cortical
"networks,","again, modulating,"
5329.74,"not directly mediating,"
5330.76,but modulating and generally supporting
5333.28,the brain networks that
are,going to allow me
5335.83,to generate focus and concentration.
5338.23,"So much like sleep, much"
like,"omega-3 fatty acids,"
5341.95,creatine monohydrate five grams a day
5344.02,"seems to generally support brain function,"
5346.18,which will generally support
concentration,and focus.
5349.75,Now in terms of compounds
5351.31,that more specifically mediate
concentration,"and focus,"
5354.64,we have to go back to
that,arrow metaphor model
5356.74,that we talked about at the
beginning,"of the episode,"
5358.75,"that included epinephrine,"
"adrenaline,","acetylcholine,"
5362.95,"which acts as this attentional spotlight,"
5364.99,"in fact, acetylcholine and"
elevated,levels of acetylcholine
5368.29,have been shown over and over again
5370.03,through beautiful work from
Mike,Merzenich's lab at UCSF
5373.12,"and the Kilgard Lab down in Houston,"
5376.09,"and a number of other labs,"
5377.32,including Norm Weinberger's
lab,"at UC Irvine,"
5380.05,"again and again,"
5381.31,to improve or even directly
gate,neuroplasticity
5386.255,by increasing focus directly.
5389.41,"That's a lot of word soup,"
5390.43,but basically what happens is
5391.75,if acetylcholine transmission
5393.43,is increased even
transiently,"within the brain,"
5396.07,there's a greater opportunity
5397.63,for neuroplasticity to take place.
5399.55,And the reason there's
a,greater opportunity
5401.89,"for neuroplasticity, AKA"
learning,"to take place,"
5405.16,is by way of the increased focus
5408.07,that spiking acetylcholine can provide.
5411.01,"As I mentioned earlier,"
5411.843,there are a number of different
foods,"which contain choline,"
5414.04,"you can look those up online,"
5415.31,choline acting as an amino acid
precursor,"to acetylcholine,"
5418.84,"but of course, there are"
"compounds,",there are supplements
5420.61,that can further and more
acutely,"increase acetylcholine,"
5423.4,"and indeed, I use these myself."
5425.08,The most effective one
I've,found is Alpha-GPC.
5428.65,Alpha-GPC consumed at dosages
5431.71,of 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams
5434.59,prior to a work about
or,prior to a workout
5437.41,greatly increase one's ability
to,"focus and concentrate,"
5440.62,"at least that's been my experience,"
5442.0,and there are some good data in humans.
5444.28,So how would I use Alpha-GPC?
5446.23,I would use Alpha-GPC by taking
it,about 10 to 20 minutes
5449.98,prior to any time I want to focus
5452.59,or concentrate very deeply.
5454.72,I've taken as much as 600
milligrams,"at one time,"
5457.87,although I find that 300
milligrams,"is enough for me,"
5460.09,and I tend to be quite
sensitive,to supplements
5462.7,"and caffeine in general,"
5464.05,so I'll sometimes take
it,alongside yerba mate
5467.47,or with yerba mate or with
coffee,prior to a workout
5470.8,or prior to a about of work
5472.81,in which I'm focusing on mental work.
5475.27,"So it could be reading, writing,"
5476.62,"could be math, could be data analysis,"
5478.33,could be anything
5479.163,where I need a lot of
focus,and concentration.
5481.0,Now a number of people have contacted me
5482.62,about a recent study
suggesting,that Alpha-GPC
5486.88,when taken chronically over many years
5488.68,could increase one's
vulnerability,to stroke.
5492.16,I've looked at those data
and,my read of the data
5495.408,"is that they're not very conclusive,"
5497.62,although anytime you
see,"something like that,"
5500.693,a study that's pointing to the fact
5502.393,that a given compound
5503.59,"might increase the propensity for stroke,"
5505.78,you obviously want to be concerned.
5507.37,So we have to ask ourselves
"how,","by what mechanism that is,"
5510.67,could Alpha-GPC be increasing
the,susceptibility to stroke?
5514.75,And it seems to be related
to,"increases in TMAO,"
5517.96,which is a marker related to
the,cardiovascular system.
5521.209,And one known way to
offset,increases in TMAO
5526.18,that are associated either with Alpha-GPC
5528.49,"or increases due to other things,"
5531.55,so ingestion of particular food compounds
5533.89,"actually can increase TMAO,"
5535.69,is to offset that by taking
600,milligrams of garlic.
5540.16,Now I've been taking Alpha-GPC
5541.894,pretty consistently for a number of years.
5543.94,I do not take it every day.
5545.26,I would say I take it
about,"four days per week,"
5547.36,"again, prior to workouts"
or,bouts of cognitive work.
5550.42,I have not seen my TMAO spike
5553.03,and I've evaluated that
by,"way of blood tests,"
5556.42,"but nonetheless, I take"
600,milligrams of garlic
5559.39,in capsule form anytime I eat anyway
5562.48,and I do that for general
cardiovascular,function
5564.64,and there's some interesting data
5565.66,"on immune system function,"
et,cetera for garlic.
5568.66,So I've been consuming 600
milligram,capsules of garlic
5572.62,for some period of time.
5573.73,"Some days, I'll ingest just"
one,"600 milligram capsule,"
5576.58,"other times, I'll take two,"
5577.9,but based on this recent study
and,"the concerns about TMAO,"
5581.943,I make it a point
5583.57,to always ingest a 600
milligram,capsule of garlic
5587.5,"anytime I take Alpha-GPC,"
5589.09,which again for me is
about,four days per week.
5591.67,"So in our model of attention and focus,"
5594.051,you can now clearly see
why,"taking Alpha-GPC,"
5596.95,which increases acetylcholine transmission
5599.17,would be beneficial for
concentration,and focus
5601.57,and why taking it with a double espresso
5604.36,or why taking it with yerba mate
5606.7,would further increase
concentration,and focus
5609.79,"because as I mentioned earlier,"
5611.156,caffeine is going to increase epinephrine.
5613.918,It's also going to increase the density
5616.33,of dopamine receptors
5617.98,and the Alpha-GPC is going
to,"increase acetylcholine,"
5620.14,"this spotlighting for cognition,"
5621.64,this ability to really
amplify,the activity
5624.55,"of specific neural networks,"
5625.93,which is largely what's happening
5627.61,when you're trying to focus
5629.26,and pay attention to
something,specifically.
5631.66,So if one wants to increase
5633.16,the amount of dopamine
transmission,in the brain and body
5636.46,for sake of increasing
concentration,"and focus,"
5639.4,one of the most efficient ways to do that
5641.41,is by ingestion of the
amino,acid L-tyrosine.
5643.72,"Again, L-tyrosine can be"
derived,"from food sources,"
5646.81,I invite you to look up
5647.71,"those various food sources on the web,"
5649.09,simply go to a web browser and put in
5650.77,foods that contain a lot of L-tyrosine
5652.42,and you'll get a rich array
of,choices to select from.
5654.996,"But in my case, I use"
L-tyrosine,in capsule form.
5659.47,"I will take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,"
5661.734,300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC
and,a cup of coffee.
5665.17,"I'm careful to do this early in the day,"
5667.21,certainly not after two or 3:00 PM
5668.92,because I don't want
to,diminish my ability
5671.02,to fall and stay asleep that night.
5672.626,I'll do this early in
the,day before a workout
5674.74,or before a about of
concentrated,mental work.
5678.444,"Again, I tend to do this"
about,"four days per week,"
5681.73,so certainly not every
time,I sit down to do work.
5685.311,And I should also mention
5687.73,that I still tend to do
the,behavioral tools.
5689.65,I'll tend to use five
minutes,of binaural beats
5691.78,or binaural beats
throughout,"the work session,"
5693.682,sometimes do a ice bath
or,a cold shower before.
5696.498,I don't want to give the impression
5698.32,that I combine every tool
that,I've talked about today
5701.74,for a given workout.
5702.94,"I mean, that would be pretty"
wild,"to take a cold shower,"
5705.85,"pop an L-tyrosine, take an Alpha-GPC,"
5708.19,"drink two espresso,"
listen,to binaural beats.
5710.35,That to me seems like
a,very inefficient way
5713.44,to go about life.
5714.334,"In fact, I make it a"
point,to try and use tools
5718.93,to increase my ability
to,"concentrate and focus,"
5721.42,but not to combine more
than,two or three of them
5724.06,at any one time.
5724.893,"And when I say two or three,"
5725.8,what I mean is I will use
supplements,"like Alpha-GPC,"
5728.667,L-Tyrosine and caffeine together
before,"certain work bouts,"
5731.8,I might use the visual practice
5733.72,of focusing on a given
location,for a minute
5735.49,"before I begin that work about,"
5737.002,I might combine those.
5738.94,Then another time I
might,take a cold shower
5741.73,prior to doing some work.
5743.11,"Other days, I confess,"
I've,slept very well
5745.81,or my enthusiasm about what
I'm,about to work on is such
5749.53,that I don't require any of these tools.
5751.48,"Again, there's no requirement,"
5753.82,there's no pressure to
use,"any of these tools,"
5755.8,"behavioral, supplement based or otherwise."
5758.375,It's simply a matter of using the tools
5762.01,that are going to allow you
5762.97,to achieve the states you want to achieve
5764.47,and to improve your ability
to,go into those states
5767.86,without any help at all.
5769.21,And this is what I find
5770.62,particularly attractive about supplements.
5772.54,It's not so much that they put you
5774.07,into the ideal state for that work
5776.29,and then you accomplish that work
5778.15,and then you always rely
on,those supplements.
5780.044,I prefer to look at supplements
5782.26,of the sort that I just described
5783.91,as a route into a deeper trench
of,focus and concentration
5787.561,that I use as a tool to teach myself
5790.78,"to focus and concentrate more deeply,"
5792.4,such that I don't need those tools
5794.47,every single time I try
and,focus and concentrate.
5797.403,I think this is an important point
5799.39,because I think that many
people,think of supplements
5801.85,as a crutch or a way of
simply,getting into a state
5806.877,for which no other tool
will,suffice or replace.
5810.85,"But in that context,"
5812.56,I want to remind you of the
larger,"context of pharmacology,"
5815.2,which is the vast landscape
5817.0,"of prescription pharmacology for ADHD,"
5819.58,for attention deficit
hyperactivity,disorder.
5821.86,Now I covered that
landscape,in intense detail
5825.37,on the episode on ADHD and focus.
5827.754,"And just to summarize, there is of course,"
5831.45,"Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,"
"Modafinil,","Armodafinil,"
5836.05,"a number of different compounds,"
5837.031,all of which generally
increase,dopamine transmission
5841.12,"in the brain, so increasing dopamine,"
5842.71,and all of which generally
increase,"epinephrine,"
5845.26,adrenaline transmission
in,the brain and body.
5847.544,And many of those compounds
5850.36,have been of tremendous benefit
5852.52,to children and even some
adults,who suffer from ADHD.
5855.49,So properly prescribed at
the,"appropriate dosage,"
5858.91,those compounds can really help people
5861.91,with clinically diagnosed ADHD.
5864.309,The way they help those people
is,"a bit surprising, however."
5868.27,"You might think, well they"
turn,on the brain chemicals
5870.82,that allow those people
to,concentrate and focus.
5873.08,"That's true,"
5874.245,but they also have the benefit
5876.61,of teaching those brain
circuits,how to engage.
5880.51,And that's one of the reasons
why,somewhat paradoxically
5884.17,giving a stimulant like
Ritalin,or Adderall
5887.47,"to a kid that legitimately needs it,"
5889.96,"obviously, you don't want to"
do,this without the oversight
5892.69,"and careful evaluation of a psychiatrist,"
5895.81,but giving that to a
kid,"who has severe ADHD,"
5899.094,you would think would make
them,"more rambunctious,"
5902.23,less able to focus and
more,distractible overall.
5904.81,"After all, Ritalin,"
"Modafinil,","Armodafinil,"
5908.137,all these things are stimulants.
5909.49,So you take a kid
5910.42,who has attention deficit
hyperactivity,disorder
5913.3,and give them these drugs
5915.19,that increase transmission
of,dopamine and epinephrine
5917.47,"and you think, wow,"
it's,going to make them
5918.76,even more distractible and hyperactive
5920.56,"and indeed, it has the opposite effect."
5922.21,It doesn't necessarily
make,"them feel calm,"
5924.055,but it makes them feel
that,"they can focus,"
5927.46,they really can anchor their attention.
5929.47,And the idea is that it's
teaching,those neural circuits
5932.231,or those neural circuits
rather,are teaching themselves
5935.32,to engage and to focus and concentrate.
5937.72,And the ideal situation is one in which
5939.58,the total dosage of those
"compounds,","those drugs,"
5942.46,can be reduced over time
5943.72,as those circuits learn to come online
5945.88,through purely behavioral tools.
5947.23,"Now oftentimes, there's a"
maintenance,of those drugs
5949.69,"over long periods of time,"
5950.89,although there is a
common,practice nowadays
5952.72,of trying to diminish the dosage overall.
5955.029,That's in the context of ADHD
and,prescription medication
5958.03,"and I acknowledge that a lot,"
5959.706,indeed 80% or more of college
students,say the statistics
5965.643,are using prescription drugs
5968.44,when they are not in fact
5970.27,prescribed those prescription drugs.
5972.04,So basically what I'm saying
5973.57,is there are a lot of people using drugs
5975.1,designed for ADHD and narcolepsy
5977.29,because those drugs
5978.763,will effectively increase
focus,"and concentration,"
5981.94,but I strongly discourage
5984.49,the use of powerful prescription drugs
5986.98,that have not been prescribed to you.
5988.21,"First of all, it's illegal."
5989.08,"Second of all, it's quite dangerous"
5990.82,to hit the accelerator
of,those neural circuits
5993.79,with such vigor
5995.23,because it can increase dependency
5997.24,and they can have a number
of,other side effects
5998.86,outside the context of
clinically,diagnosed
6001.05,and prescribed ADHD medication.
6004.385,"But in the context of supplementation,"
6007.35,"the increase in dopamine,"
acetylcholine,and epinephrine
6012.45,that one can achieve from say
500,"milligrams of L-tyrosine,"
6015.12,300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC
and,a cup of coffee
6020.19,is going to be substantially less
6022.35,than one would see for prescription drugs.
6024.06,So you're getting a modest effect
6026.043,that can similarly teach
those,brain circuits
6029.88,for focus and concentration
how,to engage better.
6033.03,"But as a general backdrop to all of this,"
6035.82,I always say and I'll
say,it again and again
6038.4,"probably until the day I die,"
6039.93,"which hopefully is a long time from now,"
6041.34,"but regardless, it'll be the same message,"
6043.95,I always believe that behavioral
tools,"should come first,"
6046.923,behavioral tools should come first.
6048.66,Then focus on nutrition.
6050.25,"In fact, I would say"
behavioral,"and nutrition tools,"
6052.5,"and of course, get excellent sleep."
6054.635,"Then focus on supplementation and then,"
6058.866,and only if those are failing
6061.83,to bring your brain and body
6063.45,to the state you need to be in
6064.59,to perform well in school
and,"work and life, et cetera"
6067.419,do I recommend that people
lean,on prescription drugs.
6072.24,"Now there's a caveat to that,"
6073.29,which is in under conditions
like,"severe eating disorders,"
6076.521,obsessive compulsive
"disorder,","bipolar disorder,"
6080.105,depression where people are
truly,at risk of suicide
6085.53,or severe mental health effects
6087.48,or behavioral health effects
6089.13,"and they're really at,"
their,lives are at risk
6091.92,and their overall mood
and,"wellbeing is at risk,"
6094.033,it's often the case that
people,cannot access
6097.05,the brain states required
6099.06,to shift themselves purely
with,"behavioral tools,"
6101.25,"nutrition, et cetera."
6102.18,"So again, for the typical person"
6104.91,who's not suffering
6105.84,from one of the psychiatric disorders
6107.521,that I mentioned before or
other,"psychiatric disorders,"
6110.325,"schizophrenia, et cetera,"
6112.55,I strongly encourage you to
look,"to behavioral tools first,"
6116.76,"nutrition, then supplementation,"
6119.61,"then and only if there's a remaining need,"
6122.91,to prescription drugs.
6124.358,This contrasts very much
6126.24,with the typical scenario
I,hear about these days
6128.46,where college students
or,"other people will say,"
6130.89,"oh yeah, I hear that there's this drug,"
6132.641,Ritalin or Vyvanse that can
immediately,put me into a state
6135.797,of heightened focus and concentration.
6137.88,"Now listen, if you have ADHD,"
6139.68,"by all means, talk to a physician,"
6141.84,talk to a great psychiatrist
6143.43,and figure out whether or
not,that's right for you.
6145.29,"But if you don't,"
6146.52,"again, behavioral tools,"
"nutrition,","supplementation,"
6149.167,"and in particular, those behavioral tools"
6152.91,are going to be the ones
that,are going to allow you
6155.13,to teach your neural circuits
6156.66,"how to focus and concentrate better,"
6158.13,and I cannot overstate
the,"importance of that,"
6160.23,"that the behavioral tools,"
6161.4,and to some extent the supplementation
6163.374,combined with behavioral tools
6165.36,really allow you to train
up,your neural circuits
6168.63,so that you can focus and concentrate
6170.687,to the depth and the
degree,and the duration
6173.55,that's going to best serve
your,mental and physical goals.
6176.43,Now there's one other compound
6177.282,that I've used from time to
time,and that I continue to use
6180.418,in order to increase
focus,and concentration
6183.327,and I will use this in combination
6186.12,with the other supplements
I,talked about before
6188.01,and that's phenylethylamine.
6189.78,Phenylethylamine is in the
dopamine,"synthesis pathway,"
6192.78,so it increases dopamine transmission
6194.61,and tends to function a
little,bit differently
6196.56,than L-tyrosine.
6197.442,"So every once in a while,"
I'll,swap out L-tyrosine
6200.85,and put in 500 milligrams
of,phenylethylamine
6203.85,"or sometimes, if I really want"
to,push a little bit harder
6207.21,"on the dopamine system,"
6208.356,and I'm going to be doing a
long,"about of intense work,"
6212.19,I will take the 300
milligrams,"of Alpha-GPC,"
6214.827,"the 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,"
6217.35,I'll generally take
that,"with some caffeine,"
6219.236,"and I should mention,"
6220.77,I don't go past about 100 or
200,milligrams of caffeine
6223.56,'cause I don't really
like,"feeling too jittery,"
6225.36,"that's not really my goal,"
6226.29,"it's the goal to be alert,"
6228.36,but not so alert that I really
can't,"focus on anything,"
6231.36,I'm not interested in having
an,"anxiety attack after all,"
6234.48,but I'll sometimes either swap in
6236.79,or I will add that 500
milligrams,of phenylethylamine.
6239.874,Phenylethylamine is in the PEA pathway.
6242.963,I've talked about this
6244.11,in a previous podcast on
dopamine,"motivation and drive,"
6247.14,and it's a very short-lived compound.
6250.53,So what I'll tend to do is take it
6252.066,once at the beginning of the workout
6253.95,and sometimes in the
middle,"of the workout,"
6255.93,I'll take another 500 milligram capsule.
6258.12,But what I just described
6259.17,"with combining all of those compounds,"
6261.18,"Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,"
phenylethylamine,"and caffeine,"
6265.332,that's a fairly rare occurrence
that,I'll combine all four
6268.29,and really only under conditions
6269.61,in which I have to do an
intensely,challenging about
6272.94,of mental or physical work.
6274.83,I would say the frequency
at,which I combine
6276.63,all four of those things
6278.19,"is probably about once every two weeks,"
6280.86,"and typically more like once a month,"
6283.14,again being careful to do that
in,"the early part of the day,"
6286.29,"certainly before the noon hour,"
6288.39,so that I am in no way
going,to disrupt my sleep.
6290.97,I realize that many of you
are,probably wondering about
6293.13,or hoping that I'll discuss things
6294.54,like lions mane or the racetams
6297.15,or some of the other compounds
6299.52,that are known to powerfully modulate
6301.44,"the dopamine, epinephrine"
and,acetylcholine systems.
6305.19,"To be quite direct,"
6306.12,there are far too many of these compounds
6308.01,"to review in a single episode,"
6309.78,and they all generally tap
into,the same set of processes.
6313.56,"Again, epinephrine, that"
shaft,of the arrowhead
6316.53,"that we're thinking of as focus,"
6317.766,"acetylcholine, which is"
the,"arrowhead itself,"
6320.52,"and then dopamine,"
6321.99,which is the sort of
propeller,behind the arrow
6324.63,that allows it to
continually,drive forward
6326.91,through a about of
mental,or physical work.
6330.45,There is a wonderful site.
6331.71,I've mentioned it several
times,before on this podcast.
6334.26,That is examine.com.
6336.54,That wonderful site that is examine.com
6339.12,"has recently been updated,"
they've,changed their format.
6342.45,"It was terrific before,"
6343.95,"it provided links to relevant studies,"
6346.71,"it talked about specific compounds,"
6348.21,"it talked about the magnitude of effect,"
6349.77,"it talked about the human effect matrix,"
6351.3,it really focused on human studies
6352.68,with links to those studies and on and on.
6355.38,The new revamped version of
examine.com,"is even better,"
6358.98,"it's really next, next level."
6360.69,I really applaud them for
doing,such a terrific job
6363.45,in organizing the information.
6364.71,There are a lot of interesting
pages,that you can read there
6367.65,about different compounds.
6368.79,So you can put in any
"compound,","ginko biloba,"
6371.37,"phosphatidylserine, Alpha-GPC,"
6374.13,and you're going to get a
rich,array of information
6376.17,about those compounds.
6377.49,And if you were to put
in,"a specific goal state,"
6379.89,that is focus or concentration
or,"sleep or hormones,"
6385.14,"like testosterone, et cetera,"
6386.19,you're going to get a rich array
6388.53,of compounds and supplements
6390.9,as well as links to the
studies,on those compounds
6393.03,and some details about
those,particular studies.
6394.92,It's an absolutely phenomenal site.
6396.72,It's one that I rely on
and,"that I know thousands,"
6399.3,if not millions of other people rely on
6400.888,and I encourage you to check it out.
6402.78,"Again, the URL is examine.com."
6405.99,So today we've talked about
a,number of different tools
6408.477,"and to some extent, some mechanisms"
6410.25,"involved in concentration and focus,"
6412.71,and really the goal
has,been to provide you
6414.69,an understanding of the
neurochemical,systems
6416.31,and a little bit about the neurocircuits
6418.199,that can allow you to achieve
states,of attention and focus.
6423.03,In contrast to previous episodes
6424.47,"of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
6425.67,where I've covered these topics
6427.15,in tremendous depth as
it,relates to mechanism
6430.38,"and also focused on tools,"
6431.52,"today, I largely focused on tools."
6434.58,"So we talked about behavioral tools,"
6436.74,like a meditation that's
13,minutes long done daily
6440.97,specifically to improve
your,"ability to focus,"
6443.13,"and in fact, there are data"
to,support that it will.
6445.49,"We talked about hypnosis, we"
talked,"about visual focus,"
6448.5,"overt and covert,"
6449.7,"we talked about various supplements,"
6451.38,"such as Alpha-GPC,"
"phenylethylamine,","L-tyrosine,"
6455.07,supplements that I use
6456.27,to directly modulate the neural circuits
6458.28,for concentration and focus.
6459.9,We also talked about
creatine,and the omega-3s.
6462.42,"We talked about the importance of sleep,"
6463.77,which modulates our ability
6465.151,to function mentally
and,"physically overall,"
6468.27,so optimize that sleep.
6470.46,And we talked about a
number,of other protocols
6472.89,that you can incorporate.
6474.12,My hope in giving you all this information
6475.83,in one single location
is,that you'll be able
6477.96,to pick and choose
6479.64,which of these protocols you
would,like to incorporate
6482.49,into your attempts to improve
your,focus and concentration.
6485.94,"Again, I don't recommend"
6487.32,doing all of these protocols all at once.
6490.12,What I recommend is
picking,"a handful of them,"
6492.63,"maybe one or two, maybe three or four,"
6494.88,and trying them in different combinations
6496.719,at different times of day
and,"for different purposes,"
6499.23,"for mental work, for"
physical,"work, et cetera,"
6501.0,and find what is best for you.
6502.8,"Once again, the goal"
is,"to teach your brain,"
6505.541,that is to increase neuroplasticity
in,the neural circuits
6510.18,"that allow you not just to focus,"
6511.8,but to refocus your attention.
6513.84,And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
6516.037,that it's also critical
to,be able to defocus.
6519.3,I highly encourage people to
take,a period of time each day
6522.671,"to daydream, to walk down the hall"
6524.85,"without looking at your phone,"
6526.62,to not have to incorporate
more,"sensory information,"
6529.95,to not place increasing
demands,"on yourself to focus,"
6532.71,and see and realize how having a period
6535.8,of deliberate decompression and defocusing
6538.74,can allow your brain
to,focus so much better
6541.32,when you do decide to return to a about
6544.08,"of focus, concentrated"
work,or physical work.
6547.17,So I want to thank you for
joining,me for this discussion
6549.6,about tools for focus and concentration.

6588.18,During today's episode and
on,many previous episodes
6590.46,"of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
we,discuss supplements.
6593.16,while supplements aren't
necessary,"for everybody,"
6595.29,many people derive
tremendous,benefit from them
6597.48,for things like sleep and enhancing focus
6599.55,and hormone augmentation and so forth.
6601.74,As mentioned at the
beginning,"of today's episode,"
6603.72,the Huberman Lab Podcast
6604.77,is now partnered with
Momentous,supplements
