0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.41,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.93,for everyday life. 
9.81,"I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology "
12.61,and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.7,This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles 
18.26,at Stanford. 
19.3,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
21.6,to bring zero cost to consumer information 
23.72,about science and science related tools 
26.01,to the general public. 
27.79,"In keeping with that theme, "
29.06,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
32.27,Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. 
35.155,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
37.87,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
40.53,to help you better understand your body 
42.23,and help you reach your health goals. 
44.63,"I've been getting my blood work done for many years now, "
47.71,and that's where the simple reason 
49.14,"that only through quality blood work, "
52.01,and now through the advent of DNA test 
54.35,can one really get a clear picture 
56.17,of what's going on with their health. 
58.12,"Things like metabolic factors and hormones, "
61.06,all the various triglycerides. 
62.91,These are things that can only be measured 
64.62,from a quality blood test. 
66.21,"And now with DNA tests, "
67.55,you can get an additional window 
69.26,into your current health status 
70.9,and the trajectory of your health. 
72.89,What's really wonderful about InsideTracker 
75.1,is that you don't just get numbers back 
77.19,about the specific levels of various hormones 
79.64,"and metabolic factors, "
80.92,you also get a lot of information about 
82.59,what you could or should do in order to adjust those numbers 
85.707,to put you on the course to better health. 
88.54,"So for instance, it will give recommendations "
90.631,"about particular foods to eat or avoid, "
93.55,particular exercise regimens 
95.348,that you might want to adopt 
97.02,and the frequency of those regimens 
98.61,in order to move those markers in the correct direction. 
102.624,InsideTracker has also added a new feature 
105.54,that makes tracking your progress 
107.91,and analyzing your data even easier. 
110.28,For those of you that use a Garmin fitness tracker 
112.67,"such as the Garmin watch, "
114.19,that's now compatible with their platform. 
116.27,So you can couple your data from your Garmin 
118.07,with your blood and DNA for even more personalization 
120.63,and insights on your health. 
121.98,"However, if you don't have a Garmin device, "
123.99,there's still a lot that you can get from InsideTracker 
126.75,and their tests. 
127.86,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "
129.38,you can visit www.insidetracker.com/huberman. 
132.48,"And if you do that, you'll get "
25%,off 
134.93,any of InsideTracker's plans. 
136.69,"Use the code Huberman at checkout, "
138.62,that's www.insidetracker.com/huberman 
141.35,to get 
25%,off any of InsideTracker's plans 
144.41,and use the code Huberman at checkout. 
146.93,Today's podcast is also brought to us 
148.78,by ExpressVPN. 
150.82,ExpressVPN is a virtual private network 
153.17,that keeps your data secure and private. 
155.73,It does that by routing your internet activity 
157.93,"through their servers and encrypting it, "
159.82,so that no one can see or sell your data. 
162.73,I'm familiar with the effects of not securing my data 
165.34,well enough. 
166.173,A few years back I had my bank accounts hacked. 
169.09,"I don't know exactly how it happened, but it happened. "
172.15,And it was a terrible amount of work 
174.47,to have that reversed and secured. 
176.444,The great thing about ExpressVPN is I don't even notice 
179.64,that it's running. 
180.473,"I have it on my computer, "
181.33,I turn it on anytime I work at home 
183.33,"or when traveling or in a cafe airport anywhere, "
186.77,"and it runs in the background, "
188.01,it doesn't change anything about the interface 
189.83,with my computer or the wifi. 
191.88,It just secures my data and it secures any information 
195.67,"about what I happen to be searching for, et cetera. "
198.26,I don't feel like I have anything particular to hide 
200.34,except my bank account passwords and things of that sort. 
203.43,"But with ExpressVPN, it basically makes everything secure, "
206.48,you can't be tracked and no one can access 
208.629,"or steal your data, which is terrific. "
210.85,"So again, I use it when I'm traveling and when I'm at home. "
214.86,If you want to start protecting your internet activity 
217.02,"using ExpressVPN, you can go to www.expressvpn.com/huberman "
221.698,and you'll get an extra three months free 
224.61,on a one-year package. 
225.81,That's www.expressvpn.com/huberman to get three months free 
230.91,on any of their one-year packages. 
233.31,Today's podcast is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. 
236.73,"Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin, "
239.05,"mineral, probiotic drink, "
241.09,that gives you a total foundation of vitamins and minerals 
244.25,and probiotics to support your health and wellbeing. 
247.11,I've been using Athletic Greens since 
2012.,
250.35,And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
253.03,I started using Athletic Greens 
254.76,and I still use Athletic Greens once or twice a day 
257.72,because it's the simplest and most straightforward way 
260.56,"to get my basis of important vitamins, minerals "
264.29,and probiotic taken care off. 
266.28,All of those things combined to support various aspects 
269.31,"of my health, "
270.75,"such as brain health, such as gut health. "
273.05,"For instance, there's a tremendous amount of evidence now "
275.49,showing that probiotics support gut health 
277.81,and that the gut brain access is important for things like 
280.69,"focus and cognition, as well as for immune function "
284.2,"and various aspects of physical health, like metabolism. "
286.94,The list sort of goes on and on. 
289.18,"With Athletic Greens, "
290.17,it has all these vitamins and minerals 
292.2,"and various other things that are good for me, "
294.56,and I actually really liked the way it tastes. 
296.47,"So the way I use it is once a day, "
298.84,"sometimes twice a day, "
299.76,"I'll mix it up with water, "
300.79,I add a little bit of lemon or lime juice. 
302.91,I think it tastes great without the lemon or lime juice. 
304.91,"But when I add that, it's truly delicious to me. "
307.63,"And I'll drink that first thing in the day, "
310.44,mid-morning sometimes instead 
312.06,and sometimes again in the later afternoon. 
314.27,I'm able to drink Athletic Greens late in the day 
316.43,and not have it keep me awake. 
318.65,"If you want to try Athletic Greens, "
320.36,"you can go to www.athleticgreens.com/huberman, "
323.26,"and if you do that, you can claim a special offer. "
325.94,"They'll give you five free travel packs, "
327.84,which make mixing up Athletic Greens 
329.58,"while you're on the road, really simple and easy. "
332.01,And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
335.77,Vitamin D
"3,","as many of you know, "
337.98,"you can get from the sun, "
339.32,but many people even if they're already getting 
341.34,"a lot of sun exposure, "
342.73,still have vitamin D
3,levels that are too low. 
346.13,And vitamin D
3,is very important 
347.9,"for a huge number of cardiovascular, immune, "
350.77,metabolic and other aspects of health. 
353.18,"So once again, if you go to www.athleticgreens.com/huberman, "
356.41,you'll get the five travel packs 
358.21,and a year supply of vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
361.74,Today is the third episode in our series of episodes 
364.62,about physical and athletic skill performance 
368.09,and skill learning in general. 
370.12,And today we're going to talk about the science of tools 
373.97,for fat loss. 
375.57,And fat loss is something 
377.03,that interests a large number of people. 
379.62,"Many people want to lose fat, "
381.5,many people are athletes who need to lose fat. 
385.29,"And in general, we know that having body fat percentages "
388.89,that are too high is unhealthy for us. 
391.6,And most people struggle to lose fat. 
394.54,"Most people struggled to lose weight generally, "
396.61,but most people especially struggled to lose body fat 
400.06,or what we call adipose tissue. 
402.46,"Now, this is a huge topic on the internet. "
404.87,There's a lot of controversy. 
406.87,"Today, we're going to talk about some things "
409.27,"related to fat loss, "
410.54,and that are powerful for fat loss 
412.79,that I'm guessing most of you have never heard about before. 
417.203,"You may have heard about a few of them, "
418.88,but I'm guessing you haven't heard about all of them. 
421.24,This episode is going to be rich with science-based tools 
425.015,that are gleaned from a variety of aspects 
427.78,"of the literature, "
428.613,"including the use of cold, "
430.78,"including brown fat, "
432.48,including something called beige fat. 
434.51,We're going to talk about something called NEAT. 
436.58,We're going to talk about all sorts of aspects of fat loss 
439.77,that are governed by your nervous system. 
442.44,And this is I think an important gap 
444.72,that's missing in the discussion about fat loss. 
447.267,You can hear a lot of information out there 
449.99,about the role of things like insulin 
452.46,and various diets like ketogenic diets 
454.56,or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets. 
457.42,"And there's some great stuff out there, "
459.14,"and there's some really terrible information out there, "
461.145,and there's a lot of controversy. 
462.93,We did a number of episodes talking 
464.93,about the role of hormones on metabolism 
468.14,and the role of food on mood and wellbeing. 
472.62,"So if you're interested in those topics, "
474.31,please check them out. 
475.62,I will touch a little bit on hormones today. 
478.29,"Things like insulin and leptin, just a little bit. "
482.24,"But today's episode is mainly going to be focused on, "
485.28,"how the nervous system, neurons, "
487.79,"and some of the cells they collaborate with, "
490.06,"like glioma and macrophages, "
492.29,how those encourage or can encourage accelerated fat loss. 
497.12,Because it turns out they can. 
498.64,Remember your nervous system which includes your brain 
500.93,and your spinal cord and all the connections 
503.54,"that they make with the organs of the body, "
506.48,governs everything. 
507.86,It's the on switch and the off switch for immune system. 
511.83,It's the on switch and the off switch. 
513.57,It turns out also for fat burning. 
515.68,And so the nervous system and the role of the brain 
518.87,and other neurons has been vastly overlooked 
522.36,in the discussion about losing fat. 
524.86,"Now, I would be remiss "
526.47,"and I'd probably come under a pretty considerable attack, "
528.77,if I didn't just acknowledge upfront 
531.11,a core truth of metabolic science 
534.97,"and also of neuroscience, frankly, "
537.16,"which is that calories in versus calories out, "
540.48,"meaning how many calories you ingest, "
542.78,versus how many calories you burn 
544.73,is the fundamental and most important formula 
547.6,in this business of fat loss 
549.182,and weight management in general. 
551.941,There's simply no way around the fact 
554.26,"that if you ingest far more calories than you burn, "
558.47,you're likely to gain weight. 
560.89,And a good portion of that weight 
562.4,is likely to be adipose tissue fat. 
566.12,It's also true that if you ingest fewer calories 
568.65,"than you burn, "
569.5,"that you will lose weight, "
570.46,and that a significant portion 
571.77,of that will come from body fat. 
573.69,What portion? 
574.53,Depends on a number of factors. 
576.07,But that simple formula is important. 
579.21,"On a previous episode, I mentioned the complications "
582.11,with the statements of a calorie is a calorie. 
585.15,And indeed there is evidence from for instance 
588.04,"Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist "
591.31,at UC San Francisco has talked 
593.68,about how highly processed foods change the way 
596.06,"that we utilize food, "
597.513,and can lead to higher incidences of obesity 
602.13,and other metabolic syndromes that go against the idea 
606.2,that a calorie is a calorie and that's it. 
608.15,"So a calorie is a calorie as a unit of energy, "
611.97,"and we need to accept and acknowledge this calories in, "
616.85,meaning calories ingested versus calories burned formula. 
620.2,But the calories burn portion is strongly influenced 
624.88,by a number of things that you can control 
627.84,that can greatly accelerate 
629.98,or increase the amount of adipose tissue 
632.88,or the proportion of adipose tissue 
634.81,that you burn in response to exercise and food. 
637.86,So your hormones are important. 
641.54,"Your thermogenic milieu, "
644.36,meaning how warm or how cold your body is? 
647.6,"How cold you make it, "
648.5,how warm you make it? 
649.333,But also your level of metabolism. 
651.21,Your levels of thyroid hormone 
653.2,"and something that's hardly ever discussed, "
656.92,"but is well supported by the scientific literature, "
660.33,how much innervation? 
662.05,"Meaning how much connectivity there is, "
664.23,between your nervous system and fat. 
666.83,"Today, we're going to talk about the fact "
669.34,"that your body fat of various kinds, "
672.18,and there are several kinds of body fat 
674.5,are actually innervated by neurons. 
676.73,Neurons connect to your body fat 
678.53,and can change the probability 
680.73,that that body fat will be burned or not. 
683.26,So your nervous system is the master controller 
685.41,"of this process, "
686.84,"and it plays a strong role in the calories out, "
690.23,the calories burned component. 
692.22,"So as usual, we're going to discuss a little bit of science. "
695.84,I promise I won't go too deep into lipolysis 
699.07,and all sorts of things related to fat oxidation. 
701.429,We're going to break down that process 
703.74,into two important steps. 
705.73,And if you can understand those two important steps 
708.41,then the rest of the tools will be very straightforward 
711.48,to understand and manage. 
713.52,And I do believe that today you will walk away 
717.24,with many new tools that you could incorporate 
719.86,into any kind of fat loss regimen 
722.2,"that will greatly accelerate that process, "
724.56,because it's grounded in quality peer-reviewed science. 
728.54,"Throughout the episode, "
729.49,I'm going to talk about some behavioral tools. 
731.98,"In fact, I'll mostly talk about behavioral tools. "
734.43,"I will also talk about compound, supplements. "
737.5,Many of you are into supplements. 
739.44,"Some of you aren't, and that's fine. "
741.22,"For those of you that are into supplements, "
743.21,an important issue in a discussion about supplements 
746.36,for fat loss or otherwise is going to be the quality 
749.68,of those supplements and the accuracy 
751.46,"about what's in those supplement bottles and tablets, "
754.34,et cetera. 
755.64,"I usually mention this at the end of the podcast, "
757.62,"but this podcast we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E. "
761.9,Because Thorne we believe has the highest levels 
764.38,of stringency in terms of the quality of the compounds 
767.68,in their supplements and the amounts of those compounds. 
770.35,"If you want to see the supplements I take, "
772.07,you can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman. 
776.44,"You can see the supplements that I take, "
778.18,that will also allow you to get 
20%,off 
780.09,"any of those supplements, "
781.24,or 
20%,off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes. 
785.3,Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic 
787.62,and all the major sports teams. 
788.996,So there's a very strong basis for their stringency. 
793.08,"Again, you don't need to use supplements. "
795.26,I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to use supplements 
797.8,"if that's not your thing, "
799.22,"but if you're going to use supplements, "
800.56,make sure that your supplement source 
801.97,is one a very high quality. 
804.17,"With that said, I want to get started "
805.9,and talk about the various tools for fat loss 
808.87,"and how neuroscience, neurons control fat loss. "
813.59,"Before I do that, "
814.54,I want to set the context correctly 
817.27,and extract some of the key takeaways 
819.66,"from previous episodes, "
821.34,because if your foundation of health 
824.15,and your foundation of hormones 
825.8,"and your foundation of metabolism isn't right, "
828.52,it's going to be very hard to get the most 
830.83,out of any kind of exercise or fat loss protocol. 
834.96,"In previous episodes, I talked all about the science "
837.64,and the details going into particular protocols. 
840.31,"We don't have time to do that now, "
842.6,and I want to get to the new material. 
844.27,"However, there are a couple bins, "
846.01,a couple items that you should make sure 
848.12,you're getting correctly. 
849.56,"And if you're not perfect about these, don't worry about it, "
851.89,"most people are not perfect about them, "
853.49,I'm certainly not perfect about them. 
855.4,But we should all be striving to get quality 
858.79,and sufficient sleep. 
860.3,I did four full episodes on sleep 
862.24,and how to get better at sleeping 
863.98,"through things like light exposure, temperature, "
866.87,"timing your sleep correctly for your so-called chronotype, "
869.75,if you're a night owl or a morning person. 
872.22,That's the first four or I think five episodes 
875.16,of the Huberman Lab Podcast. 
876.79,"Get your sleep right, "
877.9,"get your light exposure right, "
879.7,avoid bright light in your eyes 
881.49,"at times you wanted to be asleep, "
883.49,and get bright light in your eyes 
885.31,at times you want to be awake. 
886.97,So get your sleep right. 
888.6,The other thing is essential fatty acids. 
890.96,"I talked about this in the food and mood episode, "
894.7,but I also talked about it during the hormones episodes. 
898.68,We need fatty acids. 
900.16,They are vital to so many aspects of our health. 
902.95,You don't have to get them from supplements. 
904.71,"You can, if you want to, "
905.61,but you need to get them from your food. 
907.41,They are essential. 
908.66,There's a reason there's an E the essential part there. 
911.97,"Of the fatty acids, "
912.803,"there are multiple kinds, "
914.5,but for the antidepressant effects 
917.17,where the levels of fatty acids that will promote good mood 
921.26,and also healthy metabolism 
923.13,and we'll start to shift the needle in the right direction 
925.58,on bloodborne cardiovascular factors. 
928.93,The key thing is to get the levels of EPA 
931.31,that you ingest above 
1000,milligrams per day. 
935.65,So that doesn't mean just taking a thousand milligrams 
937.97,or more of say fish oil or krill oil 
940.64,or whatever your preferred source is. 
942.57,It means getting above a thousand milligrams of EPA 
946.19,which may require that you ingest more essential fatty acids 
949.53,than just a thousand milligrams per day. 
952.216,"That of course can be done through food sources, "
955.7,"things like fatty fish, "
957.04,"or if you're not into eating fish, "
959.48,you've quality meats that are grass raised can do that. 
961.74,"There are other sources of essential fatty acids, "
964.28,of course also from plant sources. 
965.75,"So look, those up online. "
967.06,It's really easy to find. 
968.35,But the research and the literature shows 
970.39,that you want to get above a thousand milligrams 
973.19,"of EPA per day, "
974.85,because that's when you can best support your metabolism 
978.39,and position yourself for good fat loss. 
981.86,"As well for people who have cravings issues, "
985.07,"they crave sweets all the time, "
986.44,I talked about this in the gut-brain episode 
989.02,and hormones and food. 
990.3,"That you have neurons in your gut that are craving, "
992.27,they're seeking essential fatty acids 
994.35,and they're craving and seeking amino acids from your food. 
998.4,"Now, these are not supplements that they crave per se, "
1001.2,they're craving those things 
1002.43,because that's what your body needs and your brain needs. 
1005.13,But those same neurons will respond to sugars. 
1007.33,And so many people who are craving sugar 
1009.89,can satisfy that sugar craving by giving the neurons 
1013.51,"so to speak what they actually want, "
1015.73,which are amino acids and essential fatty acids. 
1019.28,"That includes EPA, but also things like glutamine "
1021.7,and amino acid that can really reduce sugar cravings 
1024.74,"if you take a teaspoon of that, "
1026.14,or even a tablespoon of that a few times a day. 
1029.31,"You have to ease into that a little bit, "
1030.61,because some people can get a little bit of GI distress 
1032.76,from too much glutamine. 
1034.16,But glutamine has also been shown to improve symptoms 
1037.5,of leaky gut. 
1038.49,It's a powerful amino acid. 
1040.33,"And yes, you can also get it from food. "
1042.24,"Things like cottage cheese are high in glutamine, et cetera. "
1045.14,And then finally you can't really position yourself 
1048.88,to have a strong metabolism if your iodine levels 
1052.56,"aren't correct, "
1053.393,and your thyroid levels aren't correct. 
1055.41,You can overdo iodine. 
1056.79,So you don't want to do that. 
1058.31,"A lot of table salt has iodine added to it, "
1061.92,"but some people need to add iodine, "
1064.72,"by ingesting things like kelp, et cetera.. "
1066.67,But one of the best ways to support the thyroid system 
1068.827,"and metabolism in general, "
1070.34,is to make sure you're getting enough selenium. 
1072.24,Sometimes called selenium each day. 
1074.84,Simple way to do that is to ingest 
1076.92,the highest concentration of selenium food 
1079.73,"that I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts, "
1081.63,one or two or three of those per day. 
1083.58,You'll have more than enough selenium 
1086.03,to meet the thyroid needs. 
1088.46,"You don't want your selenium to be too high, "
1089.94,you don't want a diet too high in anything. 
1091.96,"So again, sleep, sufficient EPAs, "
1094.61,glutamine if you have issues with leaky gut 
1097.36,or sugar cravings can really help. 
1100.05,"Get your gut microbiome, right? "
1101.98,"I may have missed saying that, "
1103.16,but get your gut microbiome right. 
1105.13,That does not necessarily mean 
1106.52,you need to ingest probiotics. 
1108.53,"You can, if you want to, "
1110.08,but you can also just simply ingest a serving 
1112.85,"or two of fermented foods per day, "
1114.85,that can greatly assess. 
1116.1,"So things like sauerkraut, kimchi, "
1117.65,every culture has a different source 
1120.55,"or sources of fermented foods, "
1122.45,"those can really help the gut microbiome, "
1125.43,and then make sure that your thyroid hormone 
1127.59,is supported through the ingestion 
1129.87,of sufficient iodine not too much 
1132.0,"and sufficient selenium, not too much. "
1134.42,Okay? 
1135.253,"Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods, "
1138.03,iodine and selenium. 
1139.08,That sets the basis for how things 
1142.65,"like exercise, cold and some of the compounds "
1145.4,and other things that we're going to talk about today 
1147.83,that are I'm guessing going to be truly new to many of you 
1151.58,that can really increase the burn factor in the equation 
1156.04,of calories in versus calories burned. 
1159.01,Okay? 
1159.87,"So on the one hand we have this reality of calories in, "
1162.75,versus calories burned. 
1164.99,"However, I would also be remiss if I didn't mention "
1168.07,"an incredible study that was done by my colleague, "
1170.53,Alia Crum at Stanford. 
1172.65,"She's a faculty member, "
1174.12,professor in the psychology department. 
1176.77,"Looking at how belief affects, "
1178.84,just thinking can impact the effects of things 
1183.17,like exercise on weight loss. 
1185.5,These are just incredible results. 
1187.63,What they did was they took subjects 
1190.42,who were hotel service people that would clean the hotels 
1194.07,and come in and change the linens and so forth. 
1197.39,Divide them into two groups. 
1199.26,"One group, they were told moving around "
1203.35,"and doing your duties for your job, "
1207.03,meet the standards for US guidelines for activity 
1210.31,"and movement, et cetera. "
1211.84,And a basic lecture about how movement 
1214.42,"is good for you, et cetera. "
1215.93,But mostly just that their daily activities 
1218.8,met the standards for the US. 
1222.62,"The other group, however, was given a bunch of information "
1225.91,about how movement and their daily routine 
1229.647,"was very good for cardiovascular health, "
1232.67,"it could be good for weight loss, et cetera. "
1234.9,And then they tracked these subjects 
1237.53,over a period of many weeks. 
1239.81,The take home message from this study 
1241.32,was that simply being told that movement is good for you 
1246.06,"can lead to weight loss, et cetera. "
1247.65,"Led to significantly more body fat loss, "
1251.78,waist-to-hip ratio changes in the direction 
1254.29,that most people would want. 
1255.8,"But essentially a slimming down, if you will. "
1258.63,And all sorts of other positive effects 
1261.62,on things like cardiovascular health. 
1263.39,Simply by the knowledge that movement and exercise 
1267.35,can help various health markers. 
1269.8,So this is remarkable and it speaks 
1271.64,to the power of the nervous system 
1273.117,and the power of belief in governing aspects of our body 
1277.107,and our physiology that one would otherwise think 
1280.41,we're outside our conscious control. 
1283.21,"Now, of course, any of you that think scientifically "
1286.63,which I imagine if you watch this podcast 
1288.69,or listen to this podcast is all of you by now 
1291.82,"probably thinking, "
1292.653,"well, maybe they just moved around more, "
1294.15,"or maybe they stood up and sat down more, "
1298.36,maybe they did something else that was different. 
1300.72,And indeed there's a strong possibility 
1302.72,"that they did things differently than the other group, "
1305.68,"but the mere knowledge that exercise is good for you, "
1310.76,"that movement is good for you, "
1311.94,shifted their behavior and their physiology 
1314.69,"in the direction of enhanced weight loss, "
1317.73,"fat loss, et cetera. "
1319.05,So how we think about a given set of activities 
1322.91,affects how we perform those activities. 
1324.81,And how we think about and perform those activities 
1328.25,has a real effect on our physiology. 
1330.48,So somewhere between the hard and fast rule 
1332.96,"that governs fat loss and weight loss, "
1335.4,"which is if you ingest more calories than you burn, "
1338.5,you'll either maintain or gain weight. 
1340.04,"Typically, you'll gain weight, "
1341.22,although not always. 
1342.7,"If you ingest about as many calories as you burn, "
1345.957,"you'll maintain weight, typically. "
1349.16,"And if you ingest fewer calories than you burn, "
1351.21,typically you'll lose weight. 
1352.27,That's the kind of rule of fat loss. 
1354.68,"And yet we also have these belief effects which show, "
1358.01,"and this has been replicated again and again, "
1360.11,"that how we think about a process, "
1362.11,whether or not we think it's beneficial 
1363.63,can change our physiology in ways 
1365.96,that can be beneficial to us. 
1368.07,Somewhere in between those two extremes 
1370.92,of hardcore metabolic science 
1374.12,and belief of why a bunch of protocols 
1379.64,that are grounded in quality peer-reviewed science 
1381.97,and in physiology that you can leverage 
1384.76,to increase the rates of fat loss. 
1386.57,And so that's what we're going to talk about today. 
1388.92,I love this topic and it's not 
1390.83,"that I'm so obsessed with fat loss, "
1393.15,but rather the first the project I ever worked on in science 
1396.7,was thermogenesis and fat loss. 
1399.16,"I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate, "
1402.18,and the guy I worked for loved to explore new compounds 
1405.98,and how they impacted thermogenesis. 
1408.84,"And so we looked at how things like MDMA/Ecstasy, "
1413.59,"how antipsychotics, antidepressants, "
1417.18,various weight loss drugs that were on the market. 
1419.73,How those impacted body temperature 
1422.27,and fat loss and metabolism? 
1423.97,And we just had so much fun doing it. 
1425.44,"So if you detect a smile on my face, "
1428.54,that's what that's about. 
1430.0,"And I also learned a lot, "
1431.17,and I also came to really appreciate 
1433.45,"that this tissue of our bodies, "
1436.43,"adipose tissue and fat, "
1437.84,we think of as just this unfortunate thing 
1440.27,that's like we're told it's a core energy source 
1443.34,"if we ever entered a famine and that's all true, et cetera. "
1446.227,"You come to realize that the cells in our body, "
1448.88,"they are there as fuel for the furnace of our body, "
1454.02,which is our metabolism. 
1455.901,And there's a third player. 
1457.85,And that's where it really gets interesting. 
1459.24,"That the nervous system, neurons has the opportunity "
1462.79,to turn up the intensity of that furnace. 
1465.8,It has the opportunity to increase the amount of heat 
1469.062,that we produce and therefore the amount of energy 
1472.53,that we burn. 
1473.55,"And I was also really intrigued by something which is that, "
1476.6,"growing up, I think we all know people "
1478.45,who can eat a tone and never seem to gain any body fat. 
1482.82,Or people who seem to eat very little 
1484.66,and seem to gain body fat very easily. 
1486.38,And I was always intrigued by that. 
1487.367,And it turns out there are a number of different factors 
1490.15,that relate to that. 
1491.52,But the nervous system is the one 
1493.46,that we can really control. 
1495.32,"Both through behaviors and what we eat, "
1496.91,but also in terms of this thing that we call thermogenesis. 
1500.29,"There was one particular story I want to relate to, "
1502.42,that does not suggest any protocol. 
1504.84,"In fact, I'm going to discourage you "
1506.47,from following this protocol. 
1509.06,Please do not try the compound that I'm about to describe. 
1513.33,One of the favorite things that we like to do in that lab 
1516.29,was to find rare compounds and test them. 
1520.25,And at the time I was reading about thermogenesis 
1523.91,and I learned about a compound 
1525.32,that was actually discovered in the armory factories 
1528.2,of World War II. 
1529.91,And it was discovered because women in particular 
1533.89,who were working in these factories 
1536.08,would take a brush and dip it in a compound 
1539.94,"or a paint rather, "
1541.09,and they would then paint the numbers with a stencil 
1544.14,onto things like bombs and ammunition of various kinds. 
1548.83,And they were losing weight like crazy. 
1552.55,"It turns out that occasionally they'd lick the brush, "
1554.46,and then they would go back just to get a sharper point 
1557.12,"on the brush, "
1557.953,and then they would paint onto these various bullets 
1562.366,and missiles and so forth. 
1563.49,Bombs and so forth. 
1565.04,And they started shedding all their body fat. 
1567.34,"And many of them losed, excuse me, lost a lot of weight, "
1570.91,a significant portion of their weight 
1572.57,"without changing anything else that they were doing, "
1574.43,"what they were eating, et cetera. "
1575.78,It turned out that that compound 
1577.41,"is something called Dinitrophenol, DNP. "
1581.21,"And over the years Dinatrophenol, DNP has gained popularity "
1587.88,"in some niche cultures, "
1589.07,"mainly bodybuilders, athletes even in the modeling industry. "
1593.19,"It is a absolutely terrible compound for anyone to use, "
1597.03,because it's highly fatal if your body temperature 
1601.11,goes too high. 
1602.14,Hyperthermia will kill you. 
1603.5,And indeed many people have died using Dinatrophenol 
1607.21,as a weight loss drug or attempting 
1609.68,to use it as a weight loss drug. 
1611.41,But Dinitophenol really illustrates a principle 
1614.84,which is that your metabolism includes things 
1618.54,"like thyroid hormone and growth hormone, et cetera. "
1621.24,But your body temperature 
1623.29,and the way you utilize energy 
1626.8,is controlled by your nervous system. 
1629.85,And the way Dinatrophenol works is by changing the neurons 
1634.55,and the way that the neurons that connect to fat 
1638.49,change the way fat burns up. 
1641.19,"So we are not going to suggest, "
1643.41,I am not suggesting that you use Dinatrophenol. 
1647.788,"However, there are other things "
1649.58,that you can do that can change the relationship 
1652.81,between these neurons and the fat of your body 
1656.08,in ways that can powerfully accelerate fat loss. 
1660.607,"And I don't know why we don't hear about these things more, "
1662.9,but probably because most of what you see 
1665.24,out there on the internet focuses 
1666.75,more on what you could eat and should eat 
1668.88,or shouldn't eat. 
1670.08,It concentrates on exercise regimens 
1672.44,which we will also talk about. 
1674.35,"But the burn factor, "
1677.23,"your thermogenic environment is one of the, "
1681.53,if not the most important factors 
1683.89,in this business of fat loss. 
1686.02,And since I'm a neuroscientist 
1687.45,that's what we're going to talk about. 
1689.15,So let's talk about fat utilization. 
1691.27,Let's talk about how fat is converted into energy 
1695.06,which is sometimes also called fat burning. 
1698.955,What I'd like you to know 
1700.83,is that this is a two-part process. 
1703.32,Okay? 
1704.153,"In reality, there are many biochemical steps. "
1707.25,"And if you log onto the internet, "
1709.77,or you open up a textbook and you want to learn about 
1713.7,"fat utilization, "
1714.84,you're going to see a lot of chemistry. 
1717.37,And I'm happy to go deep into that chemistry if you like. 
1720.01,But I think most of you are probably interested 
1722.27,in what are the leverage points? 
1724.52,Where can you exert control over this process in ways 
1727.54,that benefit you? 
1728.38,So I'm going to focus mainly on those. 
1730.58,Okay? 
1731.413,This is not to upset the aficionados 
1734.35,"and I will put in some nomenclature, but here we go. "
1738.78,There's two parts to this process. 
1740.53,"One, is fat mobilization. "
1743.68,And the second is fat oxidation or utilization. 
1748.42,Okay? 
1749.253,So the first thing that has to happen for body fat 
1752.64,to get burned up or used and reduced 
1756.41,is that it has to get mobilized. 
1759.0,"And that's a process called lipolysis, "
1761.4,"but I actually don't care if you know the name lipolysis, "
1764.35,you just have to move that fat out of the position 
1769.53,that it's in. 
1770.37,You have to get it out of the fat cells. 
1772.39,All right? 
1773.223,Fat cells can be visceral around our visceral organs 
1776.16,or they can be subcutaneous under our skin. 
1777.93,Most people are thinking about subcutaneous fat 
1781.18,when they think about fat. 
1782.95,So here's the deal. 
1785.35,"And if you want more detail, "
1787.87,"great, I'll touch on that in a bit. "
1790.63,But basically stored fat has two parts 
1794.31,that are relevant here. 
1795.65,"It's got the fatty acid part, "
1797.28,and that's the part that your body can use. 
1799.54,And that's attached to something called glycerol 
1801.7,and they're linked by a backbone. 
1803.55,"So already, probably too much chemistry for both of you. "
1805.49,But what you want is you want to break the backbone. 
1807.82,"So if you just can remember to mobilize fat, "
1809.727,you got to break the backbone 
1811.23,between glycerol and these fatty acids. 
1813.27,Okay? 
1814.103,"That's accomplished by an enzyme called lipase, "
1816.322,but you can forget all that if you want. 
1817.96,"Remember, we're just trying to mobilize fat. "
1820.23,So the first step is to get those fatty acids 
1823.21,moving around in the bloodstream 
1825.21,to get them out of those fat cells. 
1827.64,And then they can travel and be used for energy. 
1832.68,"And that second part, "
1833.98,remember first part is mobilization. 
1835.74,The second part is oxidation. 
1837.77,"Is then those fatty acids, "
1839.16,those are potential fuel. 
1840.93,"They're just potential fuel, "
1842.09,"but you haven't burned the fat yet, "
1843.59,you've just moved it out of your fat cells. 
1846.04,They're going to go into cells that can use them for energy. 
1850.82,"And once they are inside those cells, "
1853.26,they're still not burned up. 
1855.23,You need to oxidize them. 
1856.55,Think oxidation is the burnup part. 
1859.82,They need to be moved into the mitochondria 
1864.16,and then they can be converted into ATP into energy. 
1867.47,So just to really zoom out again to make sure 
1869.18,I don't lose anybody. 
1870.02,"You got to mobilize the fat, "
1871.28,then you have to oxidize the fat. 
1873.36,"In other words, you have to mobilize it, "
1874.67,then you actually have to convert it into energy. 
1877.15,"If you just mobilize it, "
1879.65,"and you don't convert it into energy, "
1881.36,"you don't oxidize it, "
1882.59,it can be returned to body fat. 
1885.02,"And many of the things that the nervous system can do, "
1888.53,"is to increase the mobilization of fat, "
1892.4,but also the oxidation of fat. 
1895.22,Okay? 
1896.053,"So you have two opportunities to burn more fat, "
1899.07,and both of those opportunities are governed 
1901.52,by your nervous system. 
1903.0,By neurons that literally send little wires 
1906.051,that we call axons into fat and release chemicals 
1910.32,that provide a stimulus for more of that fat 
1914.14,"to be mobilized, "
1915.62,and then later for more of that fat to be burned up. 
1919.3,Okay? 
1920.133,"So we could go really deep on this, "
1922.42,"but I'm not going to go much deeper than that, "
1924.17,because this isn't a biochemistry 
1926.4,of fatty acid metabolism lecture. 
1928.69,This is about how to burn fat using your nervous system. 
1931.5,"But remember, there's a mobilization step, "
1933.74,and then there's an oxidation step. 
1935.61,"I think anyone of you, "
1937.41,all of you should be able to internalize that. 
1939.23,Mobilize then oxidize. 
1941.72,Okay? 
1942.553,Mobilize then oxidize. 
1944.25,So what are these neurons that connect a fat doing? 
1947.14,What are they releasing exactly? 
1949.08,How do they actually increase fat mobilization? 
1951.45,And how do they increase fat oxidation? 
1953.95,Burning of fat. 
1955.92,"Well, there are a couple of things that they release "
1959.05,that encourage that process. 
1960.71,And the main one that you need to know about is epinephrine 
1964.48,or adrenaline. 
1966.13,The conversion of these fatty acids into ATP 
1969.47,in the mitochondria of cells is favored by adrenaline. 
1973.82,Okay? 
1974.7,And adrenaline is released from two sources. 
1978.34,"Adrenaline is released from the adrenal glands, "
1980.45,which set a top our kidneys and our lower back. 
1983.41,And it's also released 
1985.56,from the so-called sympathetic nervous system. 
1987.62,"Although that name is a bit of a misnomer, "
1989.82,"because it has nothing to do with sympathy, "
1991.94,has to do with stimulating alertness 
1994.36,and promoting action of the body. 
1997.8,There's a big mistake in the literature 
2002.33,that is finally being corrected among those who know. 
2005.899,The mistake in the literature is that the adrenal glands 
2009.41,and the release of adrenaline is what stimulates fat loss 
2013.38,and fat oxidation. 
2015.36,"In fact, it was thought for a long time "
2017.95,that adrenaline swimming around in your body 
2020.13,"of when you're fasted, "
2021.44,because fasting can increase adrenaline 
2023.51,or when you're engaging in intense exercise 
2026.33,or when you're stressed is going to promote fat oxidation. 
2030.26,That's actually not the case. 
2033.09,"The adrenaline that stimulates fat oxidation, "
2036.4,the burning of fat is coming from neurons 
2039.54,"that actually connect to the fat, "
2042.67,not hormones like adrenaline that are swimming around 
2045.82,in your system. 
2046.653,It's a local process. 
2048.43,"And this is very important because it means that, "
2052.42,"what you do, the specific patterns of movements "
2056.41,and the specific environment you create 
2059.353,"that can stimulate these particular neurons to activate fat, "
2066.12,"meaning to release fat, "
2068.56,"to mobilize it and then to burn it, "
2070.36,is going to be a powerful lever that you can use 
2073.21,in order to increase fat loss. 
2075.19,So what have we said so far? 
2076.33,We've said that you've got to mobilize and you got to burn fat 
2078.56,and that your nervous system is in control of that process. 
2082.87,It's not just about calorie deficit. 
2086.71,"Okay, so let's talk about how to activate "
2089.05,the nervous system in ways that it promotes 
2091.09,"more liberation, movement, mobilization of fat "
2094.16,and more oxidation of fat. 
2096.66,So one of the most powerful ways to stimulate epinephrin 
2100.07,which is also called adrenaline from these neurons 
2102.75,that connect to fat and to thereby stimulate 
2106.24,more fat mobilization and oxidation is through movement. 
2110.98,But I'm not talking about exercise. 
2113.65,"The type of movement that I'm referring to, "
2115.5,is extremely subtle. 
2117.84,"And some of you may be familiar with this type of movement, "
2121.85,but I'm guessing you're probably not familiar 
2124.9,"with what I'm about to tell you, "
2126.59,which is that shiver or shivering is a strong stimulus 
2132.86,for the release of adrenaline epinephrin into fat 
2136.66,and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization. 
2141.09,"But shiver is not just induced by cold, "
2144.83,and there are other subtle forms of movement 
2147.74,that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss. 
2152.83,There was a group in England during the 
1960s,and 
70s,
2156.53,that discovered a pathway by which subtle forms of movement 
2162.66,can greatly increase fat loss. 
2166.05,This is the work of Rothwell and Stock. 
2169.23,It's very famous in the thermogenesis literature. 
2172.2,"And I learned about this early on, "
2173.66,"when I was an undergraduate and I asked, "
2176.3,how did they come across this? 
2177.49,And here's how the story goes. 
2180.097,They were aware that some people overeat 
2184.69,and yet don't put on weight. 
2186.71,Other people overeat even just a little bit 
2189.24,and they seem to accumulate extra adipose tissue. 
2192.9,"Now, this is long before all the discussions "
2194.95,"about microbiome and hormone factors, you know "
2197.627,it was long before many of the hormone factors 
2200.28,besides insulin had even been discovered. 
2202.781,What they did was they examined people who overate 
2206.36,and did not gain weight. 
2208.71,And what they observed was that those people engaged 
2212.613,in lots of subtle movement throughout the day. 
2215.63,"In other words, they were fidgeters. "
2218.08,And that's what they call them. 
2219.36,I'm not going to do the British accent version of fidgeters. 
2223.43,But Roth and Stock were British. 
2226.71,What they found were people that overeat 
2228.59,but don't gain weight as a consequence. 
2232.26,"And in fact, many people who had low levels of body fat "
2236.6,"had a lot of resting tremor, "
2240.04,"not of the Parkinsonian type, "
2241.53,"but they would bounce their knee while they were sitting, "
2244.07,"when they would talk, "
2245.32,"they would engage in very angular movements, "
2247.73,they were sort of electric. 
2248.94,"In fact, now in science, "
2250.28,I was chuckling about this as I was diving back 
2252.44,"into this literature, "
2253.273,because the other day I heard a wonderful lecture 
2255.42,on a totally different topic from a colleague of mine 
2257.76,and we all adore him. 
2259.16,He's over in Europe 
2260.01,and he's this tremendously successful scientist. 
2262.31,So we like to poke fun at him. 
2264.55,And every one of his movements is incredibly electric 
2267.3,and staccato. 
2268.37,And he's rail thin and he eats like a horse. 
2271.11,And so it fits very well into the discovery 
2272.92,of Rothwell and Stock who discovered 
2276.01,"that fidgeters people that bounce their knee, "
2279.3,"people that have a head bob while they're listening, "
2282.76,"people that nod a lot, "
2284.04,"people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day, "
2286.85,and people that pace burn anywhere from 
800,
2290.995,to 
"2,",
500,calories more than the control group 
2296.86,in the experiments that they looked at. 
2298.43,"And indeed, there's been a modern look into all this, "
2302.13,and these numbers check out 
2303.93,"that simply moving around a lot, "
2306.49,"even if those are subtle movements, "
2308.84,greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn. 
2311.75,"And people who overeat, "
2312.91,the people who can have the second or the third doughnut 
2315.51,or doughnuts at all and don't seem to put on weight 
2317.7,"to the same degree, "
2319.15,they are people that move around a lot even when seated. 
2323.24,They're are people that will often move their limbs 
2326.96,very quickly as well. 
2328.69,There even have been studies that have explored other things 
2332.32,that correlate with fidgeters. 
2333.594,Fidgeters stand up very quickly at the end of a lecture 
2335.95,"or they start to gather their things very quickly, "
2337.9,whereas non fidgeters don't. 
2339.92,"So dogs like my bulldog Costello, definitely not a fidgeter. "
2344.26,Every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate. 
2347.36,"Sitting down as a process, "
2348.9,if you ask him to sit down and sort of a slow motion. 
2351.99,You ask him to get up 
2352.93,and he kind of looks at you sighs and stands up. 
2355.3,"The fidgeter is the opposite of that, right? "
2357.28,"You say, how are you doing? "
2358.24,"They go, great. "
2359.35,So even sometimes their speech will be accelerated 
2362.08,although not always. 
2363.1,"But staccato movements, fidgeting, et cetera. "
2366.05,And in 
"2015,",and again in 
"2017,",
2369.563,"there've been studies that have explored this, "
2372.44,using some modern metabolic tracking 
2374.85,"and indeed simply moving a lot, "
2378.21,"being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee, "
2380.4,standing up and pacing several times 
2383.01,or many times throughout the day 
2385.43,led to considerable amounts of fat loss and weight loss 
2389.85,"when people were ingesting the same amount of food, "
2392.86,"if they overate, they were able to compensate "
2394.92,and burn off that food. 
2396.68,And if they were trying to lose weight 
2400.67,and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol 
2403.7,of deliberately trying to fidget more 
2405.37,"and move around during the day, "
2407.05,"pace, stand up more quickly, "
2408.53,"sit down more often, "
2409.68,sit down and stand up more often rather. 
2411.71,They found that they greatly increased their weight loss 
2414.3,anywhere from 
20,to 
30%,increases. 
2417.63,"And in some cases, you know, there always those few people "
2420.06,who burned a lot more. 
2421.52,It seems to work best in people 
2424.23,who are already slightly overweight. 
2427.03,"So for people that are overweight, "
2428.85,"who are kind of averse to exercise, "
2431.53,fidgeting might actually be a good entry point. 
2434.49,And 
800,to 
"2,",
500,calories is a considerable amount 
2438.08,of calories when you really think about it. 
2440.18,"Now, why am I telling you this? "
2441.41,"Well, there's clearly a tool to export from this, "
2444.36,which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned 
2447.59,without having to go on additional long runs. 
2450.63,I do hope that people are exercising regularly 
2452.59,because it's so important for other aspects of brain 
2454.94,and body health. 
2456.12,"But nonetheless, we are all time limited "
2460.73,and we are not all so ready to embrace exercise. 
2464.96,I have a family member who has been slowly coaxed 
2468.81,"into exercise, "
2469.7,"but if I were to tell her, for instance, "
2471.24,"you need to fidget more, she'd probably go for it. "
2473.44,So this is a powerful way to increase the calories 
2478.54,that are burned. 
2479.65,"Now, that's great. "
2482.38,And you can think about the protocols. 
2483.68,But I want to nest that protocol 
2486.96,"in what I said before, "
2488.92,"which is that, fat is controlled by these neurons "
2493.45,and the epinephrin they release. 
2495.31,"You might say, well, how could these little micro movements "
2498.34,lead to so much caloric burn? 
2500.99,And that's where it really gets interesting. 
2502.94,"Rothwell and Stock and others that they worked with, "
2505.41,"subsequently found that these little fidgety movements, "
2509.23,the engagement of certain aspects of our musculature 
2512.08,that are nothing like exercise. 
2513.88,"It's not these large coordinated or rhythmic body movements, "
2517.34,but rather subtle little bits of fidgety movement. 
2521.47,"And here I am doing a lot of fidgety movement as an example, "
2525.53,"tapping the pen, this kind of thing. "
2527.25,I was probably that kid in class most of the time. 
2529.345,"And I was like, I try not to do it to irritate people, "
2530.977,but I was definitely a knee bouncer. 
2533.56,I'm not particularly lean or not. 
2535.71,But I was definitely... 
2538.35,This is a common activity for me. 
2540.3,"People that do that sort of thing, "
2541.88,it turns out that it's not the kind of caloric burn 
2545.32,"that we normally think of, "
2546.37,"of like, oh, you'll running, lifting weights, "
2548.3,"swimming, yoga, et cetera. "
2550.61,"Those subtle movements of our core musculature, "
2554.29,"not just the core, but all our limbs "
2556.11,"and our musculature, "
2557.52,"those low level movements, "
2559.92,"they trigger epinephrin release from these neurons, "
2563.75,and they stimulate the mobilization of fat. 
2566.77,And then that fat is oxidized at higher rates. 
2569.96,And I find this fascinating. 
2571.5,"I wish more people knew about it, "
2572.87,which is why I'm telling you about it today. 
2574.82,This has nothing to do with exercise 
2576.86,"in the traditional form, "
2578.26,and yet 
800,to 
"2,",
500,calories per day. 
2581.27,That's a considerable amount of fat oxidized. 
2584.82,If you are in a calorie maintenance mode 
2587.85,"or if you're sub caloric, "
2589.28,that's going to add to it still additional fat loss. 
2593.07,The data on this are tremendous. 
2594.28,I'll link to a few studies. 
2595.46,If you're really interested in learning 
2596.96,about what's called neat. 
2598.53,N-E-A-T which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis. 
2603.97,NEAT. 
2605.0,So what's the protocol? 
2606.49,Fidget. 
2607.97,If you're really interested in burning calories 
2610.1,"and you already exercise, "
2612.05,you want to burn more 
2612.89,or you don't have the opportunity to exercise 
2615.38,"or you're averse to exercise for whatever reason, "
2618.62,"fidgeting, movements, staccato movement, "
2621.15,"standing up, walking around, pacing, "
2623.8,all the sort of nervous activities 
2625.54,that were so critical of other people 
2627.047,and sometimes in ourselves 
2628.87,are actually mobilizing and oxidizing 
2632.17,a lot of fat and a lot of energy. 
2635.03,And while this probably won't compensate 
2637.61,"for chronic overeating, "
2640.18,"the caloric burn from this is considerable, "
2643.04,and very likely can offset a meal 
2647.36,that had excessive calories 
2648.95,or a kind of steady state of eating too much. 
2652.93,And it also starts to open up all sorts of thoughts 
2655.3,"and discussion about when you travel, "
2657.76,you tend to eat foods that are kind of outside 
2660.2,your normal ones. 
2661.033,"We tend to eat foods that aren't so great for us, "
2663.55,we also tend to be a little bit more sedentary 
2665.32,"when we travel we're on the plane, et cetera. "
2667.73,"But all of that aside, "
2671.18,just the use of something like low-level movement. 
2674.81,"And it's almost like a tremor, "
2676.83,"but also these select short, small fidgety movements. "
2679.57,I'm intentionally doing a lot of these today. 
2680.95,So you have examples that you can use 
2684.25,to select from if you like. 
2686.42,These can have a major effect on fat loss 
2690.87,and it raises a second tool. 
2694.17,"If these low, meaning these small movements "
2697.7,that we engage in trigger epinephrin adrenaline release 
2700.77,from these neurons of the sympathetic nervous system 
2702.593,that innervate fat and increase 
2705.21,fat mobilization and oxidation. 
2708.21,"Now, it should make sense why shivering "
2712.36,is one of the strongest stimuli 
2715.33,that one can incorporate to stimulate fat loss. 
2719.93,"Now, shivering is almost always associated with cold. "
2723.08,"We think shivering, we think cold, "
2724.35,"because when we get cold, we shiver. "
2726.88,And there are two ways that shivering can increase fat loss. 
2730.96,"And there are several ways that you can use shivering, "
2734.21,you can leverage shivering 
2735.75,and you can leverage cold to accelerate fat loss. 
2738.62,But you have to do it correctly. 
2740.76,And most of the people that are using cold 
2744.26,and frankly suggesting cold 
2746.21,as a means to increase metabolism fat loss 
2749.46,are suggesting the exact wrong protocol. 
2752.37,"In fact, the one I'm going to recommend is "
180,degrees 
2755.32,in the opposite direction to the typical protocol 
2757.93,that you'd hear about. 
2758.763,So let's talk about how to use cold 
2760.74,and how to leverage shiver as a particularly strong stimulus 
2765.33,to increase fat loss through mobilization and oxidation 
2769.39,of these fatty acids. 
2771.02,So in recent years there's been a growing interest 
2773.32,"in the use of cold for various things like, "
2776.52,"improving stress tolerance, "
2778.06,"improving metabolism, recovery from exercise. "
2780.88,I've talked about a number of those things 
2782.48,and the uses of cold on this podcast. 
2784.88,"In fact, did an episode on how to supercharge performance "
2790.32,"through palmer cooling, cooling the palms "
2793.63,in specific ways or the bottoms of the feet. 
2796.22,"And if you're interested in that, "
2797.88,"and how to improve performance in endurance and strength, "
2800.58,you can check out that episode. 
2802.33,But most people out there are using cold exposure 
2806.72,typically by taking cold showers 
2809.97,"or by getting into cold water of some other kind, "
2813.13,a lake or a river or a cold bath or an ice bath. 
2816.65,"And they are doing that probably with mixed goals, "
2820.61,meaning they both would like to increase their metabolism 
2824.12,"and burn fat, as well as improve mental resilience. "
2828.89,"Since today, we're talking about accelerating fat loss "
2831.74,through the use of science-based tools. 
2834.16,I want to emphasize a study that was published in nature 
2836.93,"just a couple of years ago, "
2839.18,showing exactly how cold increases metabolism and fat loss. 
2845.55,Okay? 
2846.383,So we have several kinds of fat. 
2848.69,Three kinds in fact. 
2850.58,"We have white fat, white adipose tissue, "
2853.6,and we have brown fat or brown adipose tissue. 
2858.071,And there's a third kind which is beige adipose tissue. 
2862.91,White fat is the type that we traditionally 
2865.02,"think of as fat, subcutaneous fat. "
2868.67,And it is not particularly rich in mitochondria. 
2871.42,It is there as an energy storage site 
2874.89,and we have to mobilize the fat out 
2876.88,as we talked about before and burn it up elsewhere. 
2879.76,Brown fat largely exists between our shoulder blades 
2884.14,"and on the back of our neck, between the scapulae. "
2887.84,And it's rich with mitochondria 
2889.48,which is why it's called brown fat. 
2891.92,And brown fat has a particular biochemical cascade 
2896.61,"whereby it can take food energy, "
2900.44,"it can take food, basically, "
2902.3,break it down and convert it into energy within those cells. 
2906.4,"And there's some additional steps involved, "
2908.05,but unlike fatty acids from white fat 
2910.86,which have to travel elsewhere 
2912.19,get broken down in mitochondria 
2914.34,"and convert into ATP, et cetera. "
2917.35,Used by the mitochondria rather. 
2919.82,Brown fat is thermogenic. 
2922.26,It can actually use energy directly. 
2924.56,"It skips a step, and I don't want to get diverted "
2926.89,by going into all the biochemistry of it. 
2929.82,Beige fat is sort of in between. 
2932.21,"It's white fat that could be brown fat, "
2935.97,"because it has some mitochondria in it, "
2938.23,but not as many as brown fat. 
2940.31,"Now, cold exposure does several things. "
2943.14,Making ourselves cold can allow us to build up 
2947.41,"mental resilience because getting into cold of any kind, "
2951.23,"doesn't matter if it's a cryochamber, "
2953.01,doesn't matter if it's a cold day 
2954.42,and you forgot your sweater or your parka. 
2956.7,It doesn't matter if it's an ice bath 
2959.34,or you're lying down in the snow. 
2962.19,Cold causes the release of adrenaline from your adrenals. 
2966.24,And it causes the release of epinephrin 
2968.95,from these neurons that connect to fat. 
2971.41,"Now, the big effects of cold on metabolism "
2977.2,and fat burning are going to be through two routes. 
2980.51,"One, is that if you expose yourself to cold, "
2984.24,you have the opportunity to trigger activation of brown fat 
2989.07,as well as to convert more beige fat into true brown fat. 
2992.99,So you essentially create a stronger or a hotter furnace. 
2997.66,That's the way to think about brown fat. 
2999.21,It's like a furnace. 
3000.15,And so with this principle 
3001.85,that we started with a calories in versus calories burned. 
3005.2,What you're doing is you're increasing the amount 
3007.56,"of burning, "
3008.393,you're increasing the burn of energy 
3011.94,by increasing the intensity of the heat inside you 
3015.57,so to speak. 
3016.403,Okay? 
3017.236,I'm talking here kind of metaphorically. 
3020.08,"Now, how can you do that? "
3021.91,"Well, if you get into cold water "
3025.37,"or an ice bath or a cold day, "
3027.82,"and you try and remain calm and resist shivering, "
3032.67,you actually short circuit 
3035.33,this mechanism for increasing brown fat thermogenesis. 
3039.02,The paper published in nature shows 
3041.08,that it is shivering itself 
3044.32,"that causes the brown fat to increase your burning, "
3049.07,your burn rate and your metabolism. 
3051.05,"And it works like this, "
3052.3,"when you get into cold and you shiver, "
3055.3,"the shivering that low level movement of the muscle, "
3058.6,those small movements triggers the release of a molecule 
3061.58,called succinate. 
3063.08,"S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate. "
3066.63,And succinate acts on the brown fat 
3069.88,to increase brown fat thermogenesis and fat burning overall. 
3073.75,It actually increases body heat 
3075.6,through this brown fat thermogenesis pathway. 
3078.81,And it also over time can increase the amount of brown fat 
3083.25,by converting beige fat into true brown fat. 
3087.52,"Now, how much cold exposure and how often? "
3090.53,That's the key. 
3092.63,But before I give that detail or set of details. 
3097.1,"Remember if you resist the shiver, "
3099.84,"you are not going to get the increased metabolic effect, "
3102.93,because you are not going to get the succinate release. 
3106.29,"So if you want to get your body heat, "
3110.05,"your thermogenic level to go up, "
3112.54,you need to shiver. 
3114.0,"So now we have the NEAT, "
3115.36,the non-exercise activity thermogenesis. 
3117.51,"So low levels of activity as I described before, "
3119.9,"which are done away from cold, "
3121.75,maybe do them in cold as well. 
3123.06,As well as shiver in response to cold. 
3125.64,And so the shiver itself is valuable 
3128.31,for triggering the release of succinate. 
3129.61,"In fact, succinate is being evolved now "
3132.18,by various drug manufacturers 
3133.599,as a potential treatment for obesity. 
3135.76,Although it hasn't really hit the market 
3137.5,in its final form yet. 
3139.79,Succinate is powerful for its effects on brown fat. 
3144.09,So how many times a week do you need 
3146.46,to expose yourself to cold? 
3147.69,"Will depend on how much fat you're trying to lose, "
3150.62,and how much you're trying to increase your metabolism. 
3153.94,There are studies that describe positive effects on fat loss 
3157.83,"of exposing yourself to cold, "
3159.39,either through cold shower or through ice bath 
3162.44,or other cold water. 
3163.54,"It doesn't have to actually have ice in it, "
3164.9,"provided it's cold enough for anytime, anywhere, "
3168.96,"excuse me, between one and five times per week. "
3172.19,But it turns out that just one exposure per week 
3174.43,can be valuable. 
3175.88,The question then is how long to get 
3178.87,into that cold environment? 
3180.57,And how cold should that environment be? 
3184.08,So first let's talk about how long 
3185.93,to get into that cold environment? 
3188.49,The answer here might be a little bit different 
3190.31,than you might imagine. 
3192.33,"Most of you might think, "
3193.28,"oh, well if one minute is good, three minutes is better, "
3196.04,and if three minutes is better than 
10,minutes is best. 
3199.68,But remember the goal is to get the shiver induced 
3204.02,"release of succinate, "
3205.08,so that succinate can trigger the brown fat. 
3210.1,"It turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver, "
3213.47,what you want to do is to get into the cold 
3216.47,"and then get out of the cold and typically not dry off, "
3221.14,"and then get back into the cold and out of the cold, "
3223.68,that will definitely stimulate more shivering 
3226.15,than just getting into the cold itself. 
3228.41,"So what I'm not referring to, "
3229.67,is getting into the cold environment like an ice bath 
3231.94,and waiting until you shiver and staying there shivering. 
3235.35,Okay? 
3236.183,You also don't want to get hypothermic. 
3237.63,And I want to be clear. 
3239.355,You want to get approval from your doctor 
3241.08,before you do any of this. 
3243.76,"When you get into cold water, "
3246.06,there are two factors that will dictate 
3247.78,whether or not you shiver. 
3249.22,"Probably three, "
3250.07,but let's just talk about the main two. 
3251.47,"One, is how cold it is. "
3252.64,So how cold should it be? 
3253.68,"And look, if you get into water, that's very, very cold. "
3256.61,It can actually shock your heart. 
3258.06,It can actually give you a heart attack 
3259.48,"if it's truly, truly ice cold, "
3262.15,and you're not adapted to that. 
3263.79,"So proceed with caution, please. "
3265.93,I'm not a physician and I don't want to see anyone get hurt. 
3271.841,Just cold enough to be uncomfortable 
3273.88,is a good place to start. 
3275.69,So for some of you that's going to be 
60,"degrees, "
3278.24,for some of you that's going to be 
55,"degrees, "
3280.24,"for some of you it's going to be high thirties, right? "
3284.16,"Depends on how cold adapted you are, "
3285.78,and people vary in terms of how well they tolerate the cold. 
3289.35,So what you need to do is find a temperature 
3291.15,"that you can get into one to five, "
3294.13,probably one to three times a week. 
3295.73,If you really want this to accelerate fat loss. 
3298.2,"And you want to get in until you just start to shiver, "
3300.44,"and then you want to get out and not dry off, "
3303.82,wait anywhere from one to three minutes 
3307.26,and then get back into the cold. 
3310.07,"Now, you'll notice when you get back into the cold, "
3312.61,"it'll almost seem soothing, "
3314.57,it might actually not induce shiv... 
3316.7,It might take away the shiver that you had. 
3319.49,So here's a potential kind of sets reps protocol 
3322.87,that you can play with. 
3323.87,Find a temperature then induce a shiver for you. 
3325.84,That's going to vary depending on your cold tolerance 
3328.05,and how cold adapted you are. 
3329.56,"One to three, "
3330.41,"maybe five times a week, "
3332.04,get in until you... 
3333.98,"Or get under the shower or whatever it is, "
3335.81,until you start to shiver. 
3337.0,Genuinely shiver. 
3338.97,"Then after about a minute or so, get out, "
3342.4,"spend one to three minutes out, but don't dry off, "
3344.85,"get back in for anywhere from one to three minutes, "
3348.64,but try and access the shiver point again. 
3351.49,And you might do three repetitions of that. 
3353.9,So it's three times in and three times out total. 
3356.93,Okay? 
3357.79,That's a great starting place. 
3360.71,And what you don't want to do is build up your tolerance 
3365.38,"to cold so fast, "
3367.28,"that pretty soon you're able to resist the shiver, "
3369.42,because remember the shiver 
3370.79,is the source of the succinate release 
3372.41,that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis. 
3374.98,"So if you'd like to see this protocol spelled out, "
3377.29,you can access it zero cost at a website 
3380.29,which is www.thecoldplunge.com. 
3382.85,"The Cold Plunge is a company they make cold plunges, "
3386.06,and they were kind enough to gift one 
3387.71,to the Human Lab Podcast. 
3389.72,But I want to emphasize that these protocols are free of cost. 
3392.75,The folks at the Cold Plunge are not just interested 
3395.36,"in marketing their product, "
3397.43,but one of their main interests is encouraging people 
3399.79,to engage in cold exposure for particular end points 
3403.05,"and goals like fat loss, resilience, et cetera. "
3406.67,Resisting inflammation. 
3408.84,But their main focus is providing people protocols 
3413.59,and encouraging people to use cold exposure of various kinds 
3416.35,"not just through their products, "
3417.56,but through cold rivers and jumps in the ocean 
3420.72,"and things like cold showers, "
3422.27,whatever is most convenient 
3424.63,and accessible for various people. 
3426.71,And so we needed a place where we could house 
3429.17,"these protocols in a permanent way, "
3431.61,and not just for this episode. 
3433.64,"But so what they've agreed to do is, "
3435.23,"to post the protocols there, "
3436.5,they should be very easy to find on their website. 
3438.96,This particular protocol we're referring 
3441.76,to as the fat loss optimization protocol 
3446.74,for lack of a better name. 
3448.24,And it's really grounded in how cold 
3450.33,it can be used to induce shiver. 
3452.4,"And again, it doesn't really matter "
3453.64,"how you're accessing that cold, "
3455.68,"provided you access to the shiver, "
3457.38,and you're moving from the cold environment 
3459.51,to a slightly warmer environment. 
3461.51,So getting out of the cold shower 
3463.02,"or getting out of the ice bath, et cetera, "
3465.46,"or out of the cold plunge, "
3466.68,and then back in. 
3467.92,Because it turns out that the cooling 
3469.78,and rewarming process of the body is where shiver kicks in. 
3474.48,And so that's distinctly different 
3477.35,than just trying to get into the cold 
3478.9,and stay in the cold for as long as possible. 
3481.42,And if you zoom out a little bit 
3483.32,"and think about some examples in life, "
3486.19,you'll understand why that must be the case. 
3489.13,"For instance, people who do a lot of cold water swims, "
3492.78,"you have these polar bear clubs, "
3494.14,I think they call themselves. 
3495.23,They do these cold water swims. 
3497.1,I would sometimes see these people swimming back and forth 
3499.19,"to Alcatraz and stuff like that, which it seems risky. "
3502.45,and they tell me it's very stimulating 
3504.85,for the mind and body. 
3505.683,Great. 
3506.516,"Sometimes those people are very lean, "
3508.6,"oftentimes they're not, "
3510.34,and they're getting a lot of cold exposure. 
3513.12,"And one of the things that happens is, "
3515.44,"if you expose yourself to cold over and over, "
3517.62,"you adapt, "
3518.453,you become cold adapted. 
3519.43,"And when you do that, "
3520.263,"you no longer get the epinephrine, "
3522.01,the adrenaline release from the cold 
3524.3,and therefore you don't get the succinate release 
3526.84,and the shivering and the brown fat thermogenic effect 
3529.8,quite as intensely. 
3531.33,"So if you want to use cold for other reasons, "
3533.99,and certainly cold water swims can be fun. 
3535.96,"And there's, you know, long as you can do them safely, "
3539.01,they're great. 
3539.843,I've gotten into cold water swimming 
3540.95,for some period of time. 
3542.61,"You can use cold for resilience, et cetera. "
3544.5,"But if you want to use cold to increase fat loss, "
3547.73,then getting this shiver process going the cooling 
3551.54,"and rewarming which accelerates the amount of, "
3553.99,or increases the amount of shiver. 
3555.6,That's going to be the way to go. 
3557.88,One note about cold and some of the factors 
3559.96,that it releases. 
3561.38,A few years back there was a lot of excitement 
3563.4,"about this hormone called irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N, "
3567.36,which was associated with cold. 
3569.65,And there was a lot of excitement 
3571.13,about its potential role in increasing metabolism 
3574.5,so much so that people were starting to explore 
3577.34,this as a potential fat loss drug. 
3579.08,To my knowledge that went nowhere. 
3581.72,The science eventually shifted over to succinate 
3585.02,as the main factor in cold induced thermogenesis 
3589.05,through this brown fat pathway. 
3590.73,But if anyone out there is aware 
3592.24,of any positive effects of iricin 
3594.0,"or of any signs of irisin that I'm overlooking here, "
3597.9,"or that I'm speaking about incorrectly, please let me know. "
3599.89,I'd be very curious to learn. 
3602.29,"Now, I want to just talk about brown fat a little bit more, "
3606.87,and talk about a period in your life 
3609.194,"in which you were rich with brown fat, "
3612.32,"you had a ton of brown fat, "
3613.91,and that's when you were a baby. 
3616.34,Babies can't shiver. 
3619.28,These neurons that release epinephrin into fat 
3623.93,are not wired up and really aren't present 
3627.83,at sufficient levels or in sufficient numbers 
3630.81,when you are a baby. 
3632.32,"And therefore you can't shiver as a baby, "
3635.14,and you can't warm yourself up in cold environments 
3637.31,very well. 
3638.87,"To compensate for that, "
3641.44,mother nature installed in all of us 
3644.18,an excess of brown fat early in life 
3647.28,"that exists again in the upper back, "
3649.337,and the middle of the back and the back of the neck. 
3653.25,Over time if we don't expose ourselves to cold environments 
3657.25,"or do other things that make a shiver, "
3660.24,"we lose a lot of that brown fat, "
3662.67,but what's interesting about brown fat 
3664.25,is that there's some evidence 
3665.26,that brown fat just like white fat 
3669.08,"can both increase in size, "
3671.71,but that you can also add new cells. 
3674.28,"Now, there's a little bit controversial. "
3675.67,"People always say you can't change the number of fat cells, "
3677.95,you can just shrink them or increase their size. 
3681.19,"Well, it turns out that epinephrin released "
3684.66,from these little nerve endings in brown fat 
3687.42,and succinate circulating in the body may 
3690.75,and I want to underscore may have the effect 
3692.87,of increasing the amount of brown fat cells 
3695.39,probably by converting these beige fat cells into brown fat. 
3700.36,"So that allows us to become much as we were early in life, "
3703.29,where we metabolized like crazy 
3705.58,and we'd heat ourselves up without shivering. 
3708.66,"Some people have taken the cold thing to the extreme, "
3711.7,putting ice packs on the back of their neck 
3713.69,throughout the day. 
3715.12,"Did a episode all about testosterone and estrogen, "
3717.82,"and there's this, let's just call it a very niche, "
3722.15,"I have to imagine very, very niche culture of people "
3724.81,"who are wearing literally, I'm not joking. "
3727.61,They are these cool pack ice pack underpants. 
3730.87,"They go by a name that I'm not going to repeat on here, "
3732.76,but you can find them on Amazon. 
3735.17,Those are people that are using cold packs on the body 
3737.698,and on the groin to try and increase things 
3739.96,like testosterone. 
3742.395,But as well to try and increase thermogenesis 
3744.89,and trying to increase their metabolism. 
3747.43,"Just remember if you become cold adapted, "
3750.31,you're not going to get the fat burning effects 
3752.19,to the same degree. 
3753.33,"So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss, "
3756.13,but you don't want to adapt. 
3757.59,This is reminiscent of a rule 
3760.08,that you hear about in endurance exercise 
3762.13,"and in strength exercise as well, "
3764.04,"which is, that you want to use the minimal effective stimulus "
3767.81,to promote growth or progress. 
3769.85,So growth of a muscle or improvements in endurance. 
3772.95,If you go 
10%,further on a run or 
10%,"faster, "
3777.93,you will likely see an improvement in performance 
3780.51,provided your recovery the next time you come back 
3782.52,and do that same round of exercise. 
3785.61,You'll be able to do more work 
3786.93,"or complete the work more easily, et cetera. "
3788.85,You've adapted. 
3790.74,If you do 
20%,more distance or 
20%,"more weight, "
3795.41,you won't necessarily see the same 
3798.48,commiserate level of gain or improvement. 
3801.3,"And so likewise with cold, "
3803.45,if you're quickly moving from 
30,seconds of exposure 
3805.96,to 
10,"minutes of exposure, "
3807.32,you're overlooking the opportunity to get the most fat loss 
3811.45,and increase in metabolism by stepping it up 
3814.59,in smaller increments. 
3816.16,Okay? 
3816.993,And this also speaks to the rationale 
3819.38,for using cold exposure to accelerate fat loss 
3822.05,"for certain periods, "
3823.17,but then maybe not doing it year round. 
3825.52,"If fat loss is your goal, "
3827.14,"maybe use it for two, three months at a time "
3829.54,"and then stop for two, three months at a time, "
3831.23,because it is such a potent stimulus 
3832.84,provided you engage in the shiver. 
3836.44,Next I'd like to move to exercise and how particular timing 
3840.69,and types of exercise can vastly improve fat loss. 
3845.15,"Before I do that, "
3845.983,I just want to mention a really important reference 
3848.78,for those of you that are interested in learning more about 
3851.27,how neurons connect to fat? 
3853.82,"This is certainly a paper that you'd want to look at, "
3856.31,if you're interested in diving deep into the literature 
3859.14,and reading all the various studies. 
3861.13,It's a review. 
3862.33,And the title of the review is neural innervation 
3864.77,of white adipose tissue and the control of lipolysis. 
3868.7,That's neural innervation of white adipose tissue 
3870.83,and the control of lipolysis. 
3872.34,It was published in Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology. 
3875.68,You can find that free online. 
3877.3,They have the full text available. 
3879.11,"The first author is Bartness, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S. "
3883.17,It's a great review. 
3884.68,And I've talked about a number of things 
3886.22,that are mentioned in the review. 
3887.77,Follow the references in that review 
3889.7,"and the reference trail as we say, "
3891.56,if you're interested in learning more about 
3893.53,also how neurons control brown fat. 
3896.61,"And before I moved to exercise, "
3898.47,I also just want to highlight something 
3900.31,that comes up every few years 
3902.01,"and has largely been considered myth now, "
3906.32,but that is actually more interesting 
3909.08,"than most people might think, "
3910.84,which is this issue of spot reduction. 
3913.61,"You know, in the "
80s,and 
"90s,",
3916.37,"there were a lot of commercials, "
3917.93,"late night infomercials, "
3920.45,where they would talk about spot reduction. 
3922.66,"If you do sit ups, will you lose abdominal fat? "
3925.61,"If you do hip raises or glute raises, "
3927.223,will you lose gluten hip fat. 
3929.6,"And I think everybody knows now believes that, "
3933.38,and understands that fat metabolism 
3936.39,is something that happens systemically throughout the body. 
3938.88,That some body fat is quote unquote more stubborn 
3941.21,than others. 
3942.043,Everyone varies in where they tend to store fat 
3944.66,or lose fat last. 
3946.284,"Number of factors that influence that, "
3948.46,and in particular hormone receptors. 
3951.37,"But now at least in the scientific literature, "
3957.16,spot reduction and the possibility of real 
3960.45,"true spot reduction reductions in fat in a targeted way, "
3964.2,a body part or body area targeted way 
3966.93,"is becoming more of a reality and may be a reality soon, "
3971.76,because exercise that triggers the activation 
3976.76,"of these nerve fibers, "
3978.34,these neurons that innervate fat. 
3980.85,"In theory, if you can increase the amount of epinephrin "
3985.24,"released at those particular fat pads as they're called, "
3988.83,they're actually called fat pads 
3990.41,in the scientific literature. 
3992.35,"In theory, you could increase mobilization "
3995.81,from those particular body fat sites. 
3999.35,Okay? 
4000.183,So because the new view that the modern understanding 
4004.26,is that it's not adrenaline released systemically 
4006.98,"kind of bathing all your fat tissue, "
4009.87,but rather its neurons releasing adrenaline 
4012.57,"epinephrin locally that in theory, "
4016.01,exercise that stimulates the release of epinephrin 
4019.29,or exercise coupled with things like shiver 
4022.95,"or low grade shaking movement, "
4024.75,"or the NEAT, the non-exercise activity thermogenesis "
4029.79,could in theory lead to local enhancement 
4034.2,of mobilization of fat tissue. 
4036.65,So I think that spot reduction 
4038.03,actually will soon be something that's possible 
4041.24,using the appropriate technology. 
4043.29,What does this mean for you now? 
4044.86,What could you possibly do with this information now? 
4048.9,"Well, I think it speaks to the fact "
4053.24,that if one is going to engage in exercise 
4056.98,that doing exercises that involve 
4059.42,lots of different body parts and movements 
4063.0,is likely to encourage the maintenance 
4066.25,and or growth of these neurons 
4068.95,that innervate fat throughout the body. 
4071.02,"What this means is changing up the pattern of exercise, "
4073.92,engaging in novel types of movements 
4076.44,may actually be one way that one can access 
4079.07,these so-called stubborn body fat pads. 
4082.01,"Now, there's a little bit of speculation "
4083.44,"in the statement that I'm making, "
4084.97,but if you think about it it makes sense. 
4086.48,If you become very adapted to a particular pattern 
4089.05,"of exercise, "
4090.61,"whether or not you're subcaloric or not, "
4092.7,"you're on maintenance calories are not, "
4095.39,"you are oxidizing some fat always, "
4098.6,and you're utilizing the neurons that innervate fat 
4102.37,in a regular way. 
4103.3,"And pretty soon this innervation is going to shut off, "
4107.6,because there's no reason why this neural innervation of fat 
4111.66,should continue to release epinephrin 
4113.65,unless you give it a strong stimulus like cold 
4115.9,or the fidgeting or in this case 
4118.81,to do novel forms of exercise. 
4121.24,And there's some anecdotal evidence 
4124.33,"and I don't even want to call it data, "
4126.04,"but anecdotal evidence that people who have, "
4128.67,"quote on quote stubborn body fat, "
4130.2,"if they start to adopt new patterns of exercise, "
4132.81,they can start to access those stubborn fat pads. 
4136.13,"And again, fat pads is the correct way "
4137.96,to refer to these in the scientific literature. 
4140.81,So what we're focusing on today is the fact 
4144.26,that fat indeed will be mobilized and oxidized 
4148.19,in response to a deficit in calories. 
4150.5,But that the way that neurons control those fat pads 
4153.697,"and those body fat stores, "
4155.235,affords you a lot more control 
4157.84,than perhaps you ever previously thought. 
4160.56,So let's talk about movement. 
4162.72,"And the more traditional kinds of movement, "
4164.41,aka exercise has been shown to lead to increases 
4167.68,in metabolism and fat loss to greater degrees 
4171.9,"depending on whether or not for, "
4173.3,"instance you're fasted when you do it or not, "
4176.06,whether or not you do your cardio first 
4177.73,or your resistance training first. 
4179.81,And this is again in the literature 
4182.21,"for which there's a lot of controversy, "
4183.94,"but in digging through all the studies on this, "
4187.06,"we're finally starting to arrive at a consensus of, "
4189.96,when is best to do exercise? 
4191.69,And what types of exercise to do if your goal is fat loss? 
4195.96,"The topic of exercise is a kind of controversial one, "
4199.5,not as controversial as nutrition and diet 
4201.49,which we will talk about in a few minutes. 
4203.78,"But it's a particularly interesting one, "
4206.88,because different types of exercising gauge 
4209.84,the musculature of the body and the heart and the lungs 
4212.06,"in different ways, "
4213.57,and can have vastly different effects on things 
4215.73,like hormones and metabolism depending on whether 
4218.29,"or not it's of high intensity, "
4219.89,moderate intensity or low intensity. 
4222.34,So rather than think about weight training 
4224.61,"versus cardiovascular exercise, "
4227.08,"I think the most simple way, "
4229.91,the most fluid way to have this conversation about exercise 
4233.78,and fat loss is in terms of three general types of training. 
4238.15,Whether or not it's done with weights or body weight 
4240.19,doesn't really matter. 
4242.15,And those are high intensity interval training. 
4245.06,Something that's seems to have gained a lot of popularity 
4247.41,in recent years. 
4248.31,"So-called HITT, H-I-I-T. "
4249.86,So high intensity interval training. 
4252.26,Sprint interval training. 
4254.04,"So that's going to be very high intensity or SIT, "
4257.05,"or moderate intensity continuous training, M-I-C-T. "
4261.29,"So we've got HIIT, SIT and MICT, M-I-C-T. "
4265.83,And we can get a little bit more precise if you'd like. 
4268.5,I'm not somebody who measures my VO
2,max or anything 
4271.26,while I exercise. 
4272.1,I generally know whether or not I'm doing something 
4274.67,"I could continue for a very long time, "
4276.3,or whether or not I'm doing something 
4277.92,that I realize is going to be of short duration 
4281.61,high-intensity. 
4282.443,But if you'd like to map this to VO
2,"max SIT, "
4287.6,this sprint interval training was defined 
4290.04,as all out greater than 
100%,of VO
2,max 
4293.44,bursts of activity that lasts eight to 
30,seconds 
4297.0,intersperse with less intense recovery periods. 
4299.16,So this would be sprinting downfield 
4301.54,for eight to 
30,"seconds, "
4303.23,then maybe walking back for about a minute or two 
4306.5,and then sprinting again and then continuing. 
4308.27,So that would be SIT. 
4309.45,"HIIT, H-I-I-T is defined as submaximal, "
4313.31,so 
80,to a hundred percent of VO
2,max bursts of activity 
4317.06,that lasts 
60,to 
240,seconds 
4320.32,intersperse with less intense recovery periods. 
4322.88,So on a standard 
400,"meter track, "
4325.02,"just to give this a little bit of a visual, "
4328.54,"a four minute mile would be fantastic for most people, "
4331.25,although people run faster than that of course. 
4333.25,So that's four 
60,"seconds laps, "
4335.35,but that's back to back to back. 
4337.52,"I think in my best shape or maybe it was in my dreams, "
4340.77,I don't recall which I was able to do 
60,seconds 
4343.04,"around the track, "
4343.873,but of course I couldn't get that on the second 
4345.26,or third or fourth if I did that was certainly 
4349.76,in the fantasy land and not reality. 
4352.17,But 
60,seconds would be about one revolution 
4355.64,"around the track, "
4356.473,maybe 
90,"seconds, depending on how fast a one is running. "
4360.2,So 
60,to 
240,seconds. 
4362.62,MICT okay. 
4364.66,This moderate intensity continuous training 
4367.55,is steady state cardio sometimes called Zone 
2,cardio 
4370.97,"these days on the internet, "
4372.63,which has performed continuously for 
20,to 
60,minutes 
4375.64,at moderate intensity of 
40,to 
60%,of VO
2,max 
4380.07,or if you prefer heart rate 
55,to 
70%,of max heart rate. 
4385.27,Okay? 
4386.103,"So we can think about high, medium "
4388.0,and low intensity exercise. 
4389.61,Although low intensity usually means 
4392.37,"that you could carry on a conversation, "
4393.96,"or maybe you have to gasp every few steps or so, "
4396.52,while trying to talk and run. 
4397.96,That's I think going to be the most useful way 
4400.35,"to have this conversation that we're having now, "
4403.15,because there's so many different forms of exercise 
4405.18,that people do and intensity is important. 
4408.75,Let's ask the question that I think many people 
4411.27,"are wondering about, "
4413.49,"which is, is it better? "
4414.99,Meaning do you burn more fat if you do your exercise fasted? 
4418.5,And fasted in this respect could be that you wake up 
4422.06,"in the morning, "
4422.893,"you've been fasting all night, "
4424.02,you just hydrate and you exercise 
4427.04,"or sometimes people will ingest caffeine, "
4429.74,there's controversy as to whether or not that quote on quote 
4431.76,breaks the fast. 
4432.78,It has to do with whether or not your caffeine adapted 
4434.63,something for another episode. 
4437.24,In any case that would be fasted. 
4438.99,So probably not having eaten anything 
4440.99,for anywhere from three to 
24,hours or maybe even more. 
4445.192,As you could also be fasted in the afternoon. 
4446.86,If you had lunch at noon and it's four 
4448.85,or five or 
6:,
00,p.m. 
4450.1,"Is it, will you burn more fat "
4452.23,"if you exercise without an eating anything first, "
4456.91,without ingesting any calories first? 
4458.98,"And people have tried to really split hairs on this, "
4461.06,"every which way people say, "
4462.05,"well, you can fat fast, "
4463.73,because fat and protein doesn't lead 
4465.79,"to as great increases in insulin as other things, "
4470.82,maybe you can have a few almonds and then still train. 
4473.02,And indeed insulin will prevent fat oxidation. 
4478.79,I want to be really clear. 
4479.69,"The burning part of fat in the cell, "
4481.28,the movement of the fatty acid and into mitochondria 
4485.63,"and the conversion ATP, insulin inhibits that process. "
4489.13,"However, it's been shown "
4492.5,"that it least for short periods of training, "
4495.38,it doesn't really seem to matter whether or not you eat 
4498.05,"before training or you don't, "
4500.31,if your goal is fat oxidation. 
4502.83,"Now, I want to put an asterix near that, "
4504.61,because there are some exceptions. 
4506.01,"But there were several studies done that, "
4509.707,"and the kind of the classic ones of these, "
4512.58,I'll read out to you. 
4514.21,"What they basically did is they gave people glucose, sugar, "
4518.24,to increase their blood sugar before training or not. 
4521.93,And the kind of classic study of this is Al Borg at all. 
4525.92,So in 
"1976,","so it goes way back, "
4528.08,which is that glucose reduces fat burning and exercise. 
4531.42,"And then some other studies if you want to look these up, "
4533.7,they're very easy to find on PubMed. 
4535.16,You put in Horowitz 
"1999,",
4538.775,[indistinct] is another one where they have people 
4541.95,drink milk with glucose in it. 
4543.63,"So sweet sugary milk before exercise, et cetera. "
4547.5,And you can find a number of examples 
4549.96,where eating before exercise reduces the amount of fat 
4554.22,that's oxidized during the exercise. 
4556.81,"And you can also find a lot of studies showing that, "
4562.55,eating during exercise or prior to exercise 
4565.81,will not reduce the amount of fat that is oxidized. 
4568.52,"However, the types of exercise "
4570.57,whether I was medium intensity or high intensity 
4573.87,or low intensity is all over the map for these studies. 
4576.33,So it's very hard to target an ideal protocol. 
4579.71,"And then if you look really deep in the literature, "
4582.56,you start to find meta analysis 
4584.54,where people have actually aggregated all the findings 
4587.72,and some modern studies where it points 
4590.05,to some very specific and useful protocols. 
4592.45,And so here's the rule that or the protocol 
4595.24,that I extracted from that literature. 
4599.4,At a period of about 
90,minutes 
4602.65,"of moderate intensity exercise, "
4604.363,"I want to be clear, "
4606.22,at about or after 
90,minutes of moderate intensity exercise. 
4611.22,There's a switchover point 
4613.61,"whereby if you ate before the exercise, "
4617.07,"you will reduce, excuse me, "
4618.7,you will burn far less fat from the 
90,minute point onward 
4624.32,than you would if you had gone into the training fasted. 
4627.82,So let me repeat that. 
4629.25,"If it's moderate intensity, "
4630.73,"so-called zone two cardio type exercise, "
4634.3,at the 
90,"minute point, "
4636.72,if you happen to have eaten before the exercise 
4639.37,"within one to three hours prior to the exercise, "
4643.16,then you reduce the amount of fat that you will burn 
4646.5,from 
90,"minutes onward, "
4649.04,"whereas if you had fasted prior to the exercise, "
4652.06,you hadn't eaten anything for three hours or more prior 
4654.26,to the exercise. 
4655.093,At the 
90,"minute point, "
90,minutes of exercise 
4658.44,you will start to burn more fat than you would 
4661.69,had you eaten. 
4663.1,"Now, "
90,minutes of moderate intensity exercises is a lot. 
4667.68,So that's a pretty long run. 
4669.74,Even if you're running at a pretty slow pace 
4671.84,like a 
10,or 
12,"minute mile, that's a lot of running, "
4675.43,that's a lot of swimming. 
4676.33,"So that's a lot of walking, "
4677.81,that's a lot of hiking. 
4679.82,"However, there are people who are going out hiking all day "
4682.07,or running all day or walking all day. 
4683.75,"And if you want to burn more fat per unit time, "
4687.04,you want to oxidize more fat then you would do that fasted. 
4690.4,"Now, there are also studies that pointed the fact "
4694.75,that you don't have to wait to 
90,minutes 
4697.01,in order to get this enhanced fat burning effect. 
4701.25,The studies I was able to find 
4703.6,and that looked to me like quality peer-reviewed studies 
4706.06,with no company bias or no product bias of any kind. 
4710.65,These are studies that were largely funded 
4712.97,by the federal government in the university context 
4718.08,"pointed the fact that if one does high-intensity training, "
4723.584,or even the very high intensity forms of training 
4726.24,like sprints or squats or deadlifts 
4728.65,or any kind of activity that can't be maintained 
4731.37,"for more than these, you know, eight "
4733.36,or I would say up to 
60,seconds. 
4735.29,"So a set of lifting weights repeated, repeated, "
4737.84,if that's done for anywhere from 
20,"minutes, "
4741.45,so weight training or power lifting 
4743.82,or these kinds of things or kettlebell swings 
4746.07,or up to 
60,"minutes, "
4748.66,we'll then the switchover point 
4750.66,"in which you can burn more fat, "
4752.28,if you go into that fasted comes earlier. 
4755.38,And this makes sense because there's nothing holy 
4757.89,about the 
90,minute point for a medium intensity 
4761.58,Zone 
2,cardio. 
4763.17,That 
90,minute point is the point 
4765.72,"in which the body shifts over from mainly burning glycogen, "
4771.06,"basically, sugar that comes from muscles or the liver "
4774.49,"and realizes this is going on for a while, "
4777.62,I'm going to shift over to a storage site fuel 
4783.42,that is in reserve like body fat. 
4786.49,"This is going to happen for a while, "
4787.77,so I'm going to start tapping into body fat stores. 
4789.61,"Now, fat doesn't have a little brain there. "
4791.32,"It is innervated by neurons, but it doesn't have thoughts. "
4793.54,And you don't actually control this switch with your mind. 
4796.13,This is something that has to do with the milieu 
4798.48,of various hormones. 
4799.93,What has to happen is insulin has to go down far enough. 
4803.87,"So if you ate before the exercise, "
4805.74,"you'd have an increase in insulin, "
4807.33,if you ate carbohydrates 
4808.35,"you'd have a bigger increase in insulin, fat and proteins "
4811.2,indeed you'll have lower amounts of insulin 
4813.51,and fasting will give you the lowest amount of insulin. 
4816.52,"Well, then that switch over point is going to come earlier "
4819.81,in the exercise. 
4820.97,And if you think about if you were to do something 
4823.59,high intensity for 
"20,",
"30,",
40,"minutes, "
4826.02,so maybe lift weights and then get into Zone 
2,cardio. 
4829.61,"If you are fasted, the literature says "
4831.8,that you're going to burn more body fat per unit time 
4836.03,than if you had eaten before or during the exercise. 
4840.37,So what does this mean? 
4841.203,"This means if you want to burn more body fat, "
4843.45,if it's in your protocols 
4845.1,"and you have been approved to do this safely, "
4848.83,exercise intensely for 
20,to 
60,"minutes, "
4853.2,the higher the intensity obviously the shorter 
4855.28,"that about is going to be, "
4856.55,and then move over into Zone 
2,cardio. 
4858.66,And if you do that fasted or the medium intensity cardio 
4861.33,I should say. 
4862.163,"And if you do that fasted, "
4864.47,then indeed you will burn a higher percentage of body fat. 
4868.79,If you need to eat or you like to eat before you train 
4871.63,that also can work. 
4874.27,"And if you train very intensely, "
4875.98,you're likely to shift over to the fat burning pattern 
4880.06,more quickly as well. 
4881.53,"So again, this isn't really an issue "
4883.38,of how long you exercise. 
4885.65,It's an issue of how intensely you exercise 
4888.54,and therefore what fuel source you're drawing from. 
4891.47,"So hopefully I've made that clear, "
4893.15,but basically you need to deplete glycogen 
4895.72,or through high intensity exercise 
4898.0,and then move to a steady state exercise 
4900.33,that will allow you to burn more fat. 
4902.09,Or you need to perform a medium intensity 
4905.45,or low intensity type exercise for a long period of time 
4907.99,before you shift over to burning fat. 
4910.01,And indeed it seems that going into all that fasted 
4913.23,will facilitate the burning of more fat overall. 
4917.8,"But if you can't even get to the exercise, "
4919.86,"if you're somebody who just can't do the training at all, "
4922.85,"you're unwilling to or you're incapable of training, "
4925.965,"unless you eat something, "
4927.17,then obviously eating something makes the most sense. 
4929.27,"And what you eat prior to exercise, "
4930.7,that's a whole other biz that people argue about 
4933.874,and fight about whether or not you should go 
4936.04,"into it with low carbohydrates or higher carbs, all of that. "
4939.08,"But in general, the theme there is very simple. "
4941.34,Which is that you want insulin levels to be pretty low 
4943.71,"if your goal is body fat reduction, "
4946.38,if you want to oxidize body fat. 
4947.93,"So fasting in some cases, "
4949.26,fat fasting and other cases 
4950.57,where you're just ingesting fats. 
4952.07,"Fat and protein, in some cases or for some people "
4954.15,it will be eating carbohydrates. 
4955.75,I'm not here to dictate a particular nutrition regimen. 
4959.14,That's just how the hormone balance of these things 
4961.25,and fat oxidation works. 
4963.23,"Now, one thing that's very interesting "
4964.86,and cannot be overlooked is this issue 
4967.51,of how much energy you burn during and after the activity. 
4971.97,"And some of you probably already know about this, "
4973.97,"but the whole business of calories in versus calories out, "
4978.63,and people counting the number of calories 
4980.73,they burn during their aerobic session 
4982.5,or during their whatever session 
4984.81,is only one half of the equation 
4987.05,"and it really eclipses the more important issue, "
4989.94,which is how much of an increase in metabolism 
4994.11,does a given exercise create after the exercise? 
4998.57,"And we could talk for hours about this, "
5000.03,"but the simple way to view this is that, "
5001.86,"high intensity training, anaerobic training "
5005.08,"of weight training, sprints, burpees, any kind of thing. "
5009.2,I don't know these days I hear that you're not supposed 
5011.41,to do burpees that people think burpees are dangerous. 
5013.28,So I'm not suggesting any particular movements here. 
5015.09,You have to decide what's right for you. 
5018.06,I do burpees. 
5019.38,"I don't seem to be injured from them, "
5021.18,but I hear that they're terrible for some people. 
5023.31,"So anyway, push-ups, sit-ups, "
5025.76,whatever it happens to be that anaerobic exercise 
5028.98,that's of higher intensity or sprints 
5032.81,taps into glycogen stores during the movement 
5035.82,and we'll burn more energy per unit time 
5038.9,than moderate intensity. 
5039.83,High intensity burns more than modern intensity. 
5041.62,That's straightforward. 
5043.61,What's interesting is that all the studies 
5046.84,that I was able to find on what happens 
5049.27,after that type of exercise showed 
5050.685,that the percentage of fat that you burn 
5052.99,after high intensity exercise is actually greater. 
5056.71,"In other words, you burn a lot of glycogen "
5058.36,during the high intensity exercise. 
5060.15,"And then after the exercise, "
5061.94,the post exercise oxygen consumption 
5064.13,as it sometimes called goes up. 
5067.24,We know this after you train intensely 
5068.98,that post exercise oxygen consumption goes up 
5071.23,sometimes for up to 
24,hours. 
5073.92,And it is during that period of time 
5075.62,that you oxidize more fat not glycogen. 
5079.23,"Now, what's interesting is that the reverse is also true, "
5082.93,for people that do long bouts of low 
5085.2,or moderate intensity exercise. 
5086.93,"So typically this would be things like running, "
5088.59,"swimming, biking, et cetera. "
5089.71,So 
"60,",
90,"minutes, two hours "
5092.05,maybe even people that are training for marathons 
5093.93,"or half marathons, "
5095.13,"when they stop training, "
5097.352,"they burn more glycogen, more carbohydrate, "
5101.64,even though they were burning more body fat per unit time 
5105.45,during the low intensity exercise. 
5107.13,So there's this kind of inversion. 
5108.5,"High-intensity burns more glycogen during the activity, "
5110.98,more body fat afterwards. 
5113.3,Moderate to low intensity burns more percentage-wise 
5117.25,more body fat is oxidized than glycogen 
5121.265,during the actual exercise afterward it's more glycogen. 
5124.83,So I don't want this to get too complicated. 
5127.06,"The point is you should pick exercise that you like, "
5130.75,"that you're going to do regularly, "
5132.56,but it does seem that the high intensity exercise 
5136.34,followed by moderate intensity exercise 
5139.32,is going to be optimal for fat burning overall. 
5141.93,"Because when you look at the percentage of body fat burned, "
5145.43,and you look at the overall increase 
5147.61,"in basal metabolic rate, "
5149.47,moderate and high intensity training 
5152.61,followed by low intensity training 
5154.88,or even just followed by going back into life 
5157.58,is going to be the best way to continue to burn body fat 
5160.69,because of the ways that it increases basal metabolic rate. 
5165.04,This could be distilled into a simple protocol 
5167.73,whereby three or four times a week 
5170.37,you do high intensity training followed by either nothing 
5173.3,or followed by low intensity training 
5176.61,especially if you're able to do that fasted. 
5179.5,And I should just mention that none of this stuff 
5181.74,about fasted is about performance. 
5183.74,"If you want to perform really well, "
5185.91,this is for reasons of performance 
5187.834,"and you want to, you know, it's for a sport or a competition, "
5190.56,it's not for body fat purposes. 
5192.2,"Well, then all of this kind of falls away "
5194.61,and is modified by what's ideal to eat for performance. 
5197.22,But what we're talking about today 
5198.21,is how to optimize body fat loss. 
5202.54,So train moderately to very high intensity 
5208.24,"and then moderate to low intensity, "
5211.51,"or train moderate to high intensity, "
5213.88,and then go about life. 
5215.16,"And in fact, I have a friend who uses this strategy. "
5219.03,He likes the train intensely 
5220.53,and not that often protocol cause he's a very busy person. 
5223.18,So he'll train for 
20,or 
30,minutes intensely 
5225.34,"with weights or just body weight movement doing a lot, "
5228.33,he does burpees and push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups 
5230.62,and just kind of moving and kind of circuit type training. 
5233.7,"But where he's breathing really hard, "
5235.17,"the goal he always says is, "
5236.31,I want to breathe hard for 
30,minutes every day. 
5238.83,And then afterwards he hydrates and drinks coffee 
5241.63,and moves into his day. 
5242.68,And he's walking around and taking calls 
5244.44,and carrying around his children 
5245.88,and doing all these kinds of things 
5246.85,that keep him really busy 
5247.683,which is kind of like low intensity work. 
5249.46,So I think you get the principle now. 
5251.35,But you should all be asking yourselves 
5253.92,as scientists of yourselves. 
5256.38,Why would it be that certain patterns of exercise 
5258.94,would lead to more or less fat loss? 
5261.64,"I mean, it can't just be about the energy burn. "
5264.01,We already established that. 
5265.55,"And again, it has to do with the neurons. "
5267.53,It has to do with how we engage the nervous system. 
5270.08,"So while non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis, NEAT, "
5273.57,the fidgeting and cold can induce thermogenesis 
5277.6,by engaging shiver tight movement or low-level movements. 
5281.07,"Big movements that are of very high intensity, "
5284.49,"meaning they require a lot of effort, "
5286.01,deploy a lot of adrenaline epinephrin from our neurons 
5289.82,and signal particular types 
5292.98,"and amounts of fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation, "
5298.16,"whereas low level intensity exercise, "
5300.5,"low or moderate intensity exercise, "
5302.41,"walking, running, biking "
5303.89,"where you can do that easily, "
5305.16,there's not very much adrenaline release. 
5307.11,So adrenaline aka epinephrin 
5311.45,is really the final common path 
5313.66,"by which movement of any kind, "
5315.92,"whether or not it's low level shiver, "
5317.41,whether or not it's lifting a barbell sprinting up a hill 
5320.72,or doing a long bike ride. 
5322.36,Adrenaline is the effector of fat loss. 
5326.95,"It's the trigger end, it's the effector. "
5329.56,So now I want to turn our attention to compounds 
5332.91,"that increase epinephrin and adrenaline, "
5335.55,as well as compounds that work outside 
5338.29,the adrenaline epinephrin pathway 
5340.77,to increase the rates of fat loss. 
5343.12,I almost always save compounds and supplements 
5346.21,"and things of that sort to the end, "
5347.99,because I do believe that people should look first 
5350.84,towards behavioral tools and an understanding of the science 
5354.27,before they look toward a supplement 
5357.3,or a particular thing that they can extract from diet. 
5361.32,This is mainly to try and shift people away 
5363.07,from the kind of magic pill phenomenon or the idea 
5366.02,that there is a magic pill because there really isn't. 
5368.13,"And frankly, there never will be. "
5369.7,But there are some compounds 
5370.95,that can greatly increase fat oxidation and mobilization. 
5374.63,And understanding which compounds increase oxidation 
5378.34,or mobilization can be very useful 
5381.01,if your goal is to accelerate fat loss. 
5383.87,There are things that people can ingest 
5386.37,that will allow them to oxidize more fat. 
5390.09,And that occurs mainly by increasing the amount 
5392.58,of epinephrin that is released from neurons 
5395.16,that innovate fat tissue. 
5397.31,One of the more common ones is one 
5399.15,that you may already be using which is caffeine. 
5402.67,"It's well-established that caffeine can enhance performance, "
5406.82,if you're caffeine adapted. 
5408.28,I talked about this in an earlier episode 
5410.22,so I want to make sure I'm very clear about this. 
5412.17,If you are not used to drinking caffeine 
5414.43,and you suddenly decide I'm going to drink 
5417.42,"a big cup of coffee before training, "
5420.17,you will vasoconstrict and you will limit performance. 
5424.25,So that's performance. 
5425.53,"If you're caffeine adapted however, "
5428.06,there's this kind of interesting phenomenon 
5429.95,where ingestion of caffeine 
5431.67,"serves more as a performance enhancer, "
5434.7,"both by increasing alertness, "
5436.16,but also by way of dilating vasculature 
5439.94,of allowing more blood flow. 
5442.44,"Now, caffeine for burning more fat for oxidizing "
5446.72,and mobilizing more fat is an interesting one. 
5450.05,It can be effective at dosages up to 
400,milligrams. 
5454.59,You have to be careful if you're caffeine sensitive. 
5456.95,Some people have just the littlest bit of caffeine 
5458.98,"and their mind goes crazy, "
5460.77,and they're very uncomfortable. 
5462.0,It can have cardiovascular effects for some people 
5464.13,"or hypertension, et cetera. "
5465.3,So please check with your doctor. 
5467.07,But 
400,milligrams is roughly a cup and a half a coffee 
5472.21,or two cups of coffee. 
5473.3,"Nowadays, there's a lot more caffeine in coffee. "
5476.53,So if you go to a typical cafe 
5479.79,and you were to get their medium-sized 
5482.67,"that would have close to a gram of caffeine, "
5485.25,"which is why, if you're a regular caffeine consumer "
5488.49,and you don't get that gram of caffeine 
5490.33,"in your coffee each day, you will get a headache. "
5492.35,It can cause constriction and dilation of blood vessels 
5495.25,"in ways that's complicated, "
5497.05,but you'll get a headache. 
5499.15,Some people like the way they feel drinking 
5502.62,
100,to 
"200,",
300,maybe 
400,milligrams of caffeine 
5505.69,before training. 
5506.523,And indeed that will lead to increase fat oxidation. 
5509.41,It will do that because you will release more epinephrin 
5512.28,and adrenaline. 
5513.51,So let's just place this in the context 
5515.74,of what we said previously. 
5516.87,Let's say you normally do Zone 
2,"cardio, "
5519.52,so you're going out for a moderately intense run 
5522.63,for 
30,to 
60,minutes or so. 
5525.09,I think the current recommendation guidelines in the States 
5528.12,are that people engage in 
30,minutes 
5531.61,of moderate intensity exercise five days a week 
5535.85,for that's 
150,minutes. 
5538.57,If their goal is to improve 
5540.46,or maintain health of the cardiovascular system. 
5544.85,
80%,"of people in the United States fail to do that, "
5547.95,or anything close to it. 
5549.93,We are way below threshold for what the government 
5552.76,has recommended. 
5553.593,"In this case, the government recommendations, "
5555.06,I think are pretty good. 
5556.25,That's one could always do better of course. 
5558.83,But 
80%,of people aren't even doing that. 
5561.5,"However, just using the logic "
5564.082,and the understanding of how epinephrin adrenaline 
5567.27,is affecting this fat oxidation process. 
5569.52,If you were to go out for 
15,minutes 
5571.99,"and you drank caffeine before you went, "
5574.42,"yes, you'll probably oxidize more fat per unit time. "
5578.89,Can you compensate for the exercise 
5581.59,you're not doing just by drinking caffeine? 
5584.04,"Well, probably if you were just talking about fat loss, "
5587.43,"if that caffeine makes you fidget a lot, right? "
5590.09,The amount of calories that you burn in a 
30,"minute run, "
5593.25,unless the run is very intense 
5594.9,"and you're wearing a weight vest and it's up a hill, "
5596.94,"it's not that great, right? "
5598.603,Then you probably get you in somewhere 
5600.25,into the 
"400,",
500,calories burned area. 
5604.37,"But I said earlier, and there are a lot of data now "
5607.18,to support that fidgeting for a day 
5608.6,can burn anywhere from 
800,to 
"2,",
500,calories a day. 
5611.69,"So you might say, well, fidgeting is better than running, "
5613.65,"ah, but it doesn't trigger the activation "
5615.72,and the positive health effects 
5617.95,of the cardiovascular system. 
5619.7,"So fidgeting alone can be great, "
5622.39,but you need exercise for other reasons. 
5625.6,Caffeine can enhance the amount of fat 
5627.243,that you burn in any duration of exercise. 
5630.15,And it can shift the percentage of fat 
5632.46,that you oxidize compared to glycogen. 
5635.63,Unless you take that caffeine and it ramps you up so much 
5639.4,"that you're training really, really intensely. "
5641.63,"The bottom line is, "
5642.81,"if you like caffeine and you can use it safely, "
5646.01,ingesting somewhere between 
104,milligrams of caffeine 
5649.82,prior to exercise somewhere between 
30,to 
40,minutes 
5653.09,before exercise can be beneficial 
5655.857,if we're talking about fat oxidation burning more body fat. 
5660.73,So that's caffeine. 
5662.01,There are a number of other things 
5663.1,"that have existed over the years that are in this pathway, "
5665.6,"things like ephedrine which is now illegal in most states, "
5671.07,I think maybe an all states 
5672.37,"because people were dropping dead from taking ephedrine, "
5675.33,because they were heating up too much. 
5677.41,It's interesting it wasn't direct effects on the heart 
5679.96,causing heart attack. 
5681.29,It could trigger by way of adrenergic receptors. 
5685.95,"If you'd like to know, "
5687.4,increases in body temperature and heat. 
5690.57,"Now, those drugs turned out to be dangerous, "
5693.87,because people were overheating and dying. 
5695.5,There was also the big Fen-Phen craze. 
5697.61,That was a drug that was released fenfluramine 
5701.26,which actually was quite effective 
5703.89,"as an anti obesity drug, "
5705.64,a treatment for obesity that had to be outlawed as well. 
5710.13,It was FDA approval was removed 
5713.66,because again people were dying 
5715.21,because of cardiovascular effects. 
5717.04,I don't know if people were overheating on it as well. 
5719.8,So what is the solution? 
5721.46,If caffeine is the kind of the entry point for most people 
5724.9,of using compounds to increase the rate 
5727.04,"or percentage of fat loss in exercise and even at rest, "
5731.22,what are some of the other things that are useful 
5733.41,and interesting? 
5734.243,"Well, in terms of tools that are actionable "
5736.55,"and have reasonable safety margins, "
5738.94,I've talked before about something called GLP-
1.,
5743.57,This is something that can be triggered 
5746.2,"by the ingestion of yerba mate, which is a tea, "
5748.687,"and I guess because I'm half Argentine, "
5751.47,we grew up drinking mate. 
5752.67,I think I was drinking mate from the time 
5754.12,I was about three or four years old. 
5756.01,I don't suggest that for kids. 
5757.45,I don't think kids should be ingesting caffeine. 
5760.57,But anyway I did it and I still ingest mate. 
5764.83,Mate increases GLP-
1.,
5767.49,GLP-
1,is in the glucagon pathway. 
5770.71,So let's just quickly return to our biochemistry. 
5773.08,"As you recall, fat is mobilized from body fat stores "
5777.43,and then it's burned up. 
5778.9,It's oxidized in cells. 
5780.75,It actually needs to be converted into ATP. 
5784.1,And those fatty acids are essentially converted into ATP 
5788.81,in the mitochondria of the cell. 
5791.07,High insulin prevents that from happening 
5794.81,and glucagon facilitates that process. 
5799.58,Glucagon facilitates that process 
5801.88,through increases in GLP-
1.,
5804.5,The short takeaway is mate increases GLP-
1,
5809.33,"and yes, increases the percentage of fat that you will burn. "
5812.63,It increases fat burning. 
5814.4,"And that is especially true, "
5815.86,"it turns out from the scientific literature, "
5817.99,if you ingest mate prior to exercise of any kind. 
5822.06,So if you want to burn more fat drinking mate 
5826.05,before exercise is good. 
5828.23,Drinking it at rest when you're not exercising 
5831.26,will also help shift your metabolism 
5833.57,toward enhanced burning of fat by increasing fat oxidation. 
5838.1,"Now, there's a whole category of pharmaceuticals "
5841.38,that's being developed right now 
5842.87,that are in late stage trials 
5845.48,or are in use for the treatment of diabetes 
5847.86,which capitalize on this GLP-
1,pathway. 
5852.09,They go by various names 
5853.96,and there are people on the internet 
5855.96,who are selling these things. 
5857.32,They are prescription drugs 
5858.67,and I want to emphasize that they are prescription drugs 
5861.01,and you obviously wouldn't want to use 
5862.5,any of these without a prescription and a requirement. 
5865.68,It does seem that they are effective 
5867.14,for the treatment of certain kinds of diabetes 
5869.94,and lead to fairly significant weight loss 
5873.99,and reduction in appetite. 
5875.67,So this is kind of the modern version of GLP-
1,
5879.63,is pharmaceuticals of GLP-
1,metabolism 
5883.84,"are drugs such as somatical, "
5887.3,I can never pronounce this. 
5888.64,I can't seem to pronounce many things it seems. 
5891.12,Semaglutide is the way I would pronounce it. 
5894.04,S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E. 
5900.096,Semaglutide but that's not the way you pronounce it. 
5902.34,But Semaglutide is the way that it's been described 
5905.11,on the internet. 
5906.59,"In any case, this compound increases GLP-"
1.,
5910.52,It's actually a GLP-
1,"analog in some cases, "
5913.46,and they go by various types of trade names. 
5917.36,So the GLP-
1,pathway is interesting. 
5919.35,"Most people, including myself, "
5921.45,are not interested in taking a prescription drug 
5923.37,to increase GLP-
"1,",
5924.49,I do it through the ingestion of mate. 
5926.46,"I just get the mate leaves, pour water over it and drink it. "
5929.32,"What's kind of interesting, "
5930.6,that's not often discussed 
5932.4,is that you can increase the amount of GLP-
1,"by, "
5938.04,you can essentially reuse the tea. 
5940.3,"The first time you drink it it can be very, very intense. "
5943.59,"And in fact, some people find that mate "
5946.51,almost tastes like burnt leaves. 
5948.01,It's too intense. 
5948.843,You don't want the water to be too hot. 
5950.6,But I learned this trick from a friend. 
5952.52,"You can reuse the leaves over and over again, "
5954.69,probably for about a day before they go bad. 
5956.82,"And in doing that, you start to extract more and more "
5959.81,of the compounds from the mate leaf that increased GLP-
1.,
5963.01,So it's kind of cool. 
5963.843,You can kind of get an increased effect. 
5965.36,So what I'll typically do is make a about 
16,to 
30,ounces 
5969.31,"and just sip it throughout the day, "
5970.35,and I do like it before I train. 
5972.07,Some people who don't like mate 
5974.62,"might prefer something like guayusa, "
5977.35,which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A. 
5981.8,"G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa which is from Ecuador, "
5986.6,despite the USA ending to it. 
5988.67,It's from Ecuador. 
5989.503,And it's a sweeter tasting tea. 
5992.58,"It doesn't have any sweetener in it, "
5994.41,but the leaf of the guayusa plant is sweeter 
5997.18,than the mate plant. 
5998.53,I sometimes will mix the two 
6000.06,and then make the tea with that. 
6002.61,There's no mate or guayusa sponsor of the podcast. 
6005.34,These are just tools to increase GLP-
1,and fat oxidation. 
6009.7,"And again, the Semaglutide is the prescription version "
6014.64,of the that's kind of the heavy artillery GLP-
1,"stimulant, "
6018.89,and again should be only explored with a prescription. 
6022.12,So those are the compounds 
6024.926,that really increase fat oxidation directly. 
6028.42,There are going to be a number of things that impact insulin 
6031.53,and glucagon that are going to shift the body 
6036.23,toward more fat burning. 
6037.57,We talked about a lot of these during the episode 
6040.15,on hormones. 
6041.46,We talked about it. 
6042.293,We did a whole episode on hormones and metabolism. 
6044.49,"And so for instance, berberine, "
6046.72,which comes from a plant or metformin are compounds 
6050.87,that are now in kind of growing use 
6054.07,for reducing blood glucose. 
6055.67,"They are very potent at reducing blood glucose, "
6058.55,which will reduce insulin because the job 
6060.75,of the hormone insulin is to essentially manage glucose 
6064.39,in the bloodstream. 
6065.57,So there are a huge gallery of compounds 
6068.56,that will reduce insulin 
6070.2,and thereby can increase fat oxidation. 
6072.96,"And that's because, as I mentioned before, "
6075.35,"fat oxidation, this conversion of fatty acids into ATP "
6079.01,in the mitochondria is inhibited by insulin. 
6081.52,"So if you keep insulin low, "
6082.97,you're going to increase that process. 
6085.07,Which brings us full circle back 
6087.31,to the issue of diet and nutrition. 
6090.18,There is really solid evidence from the Gardner Lab 
6096.63,"at Stanford and from other labs showing that, "
6098.45,"when you look at different diets, "
6100.31,"you look at low fat diets, "
6101.99,"high fat diets, "
6103.11,"keto diets, intermittent fasting, "
6106.97,"provided people stick to their particular diet, "
6109.34,it doesn't really matter which diet you follow. 
6112.7,You can still get a caloric deficit 
6114.29,and you get weight loss. 
6116.44,Adherence however is always an issue. 
6118.75,"And so what I always say is, "
6120.29,that you want to use the eating plan 
6122.96,"that is obviously beneficial to your health, "
6125.67,but the one that allows you to adhere 
6128.07,"to whatever it is that the particular nutrition protocol is, "
6132.3,right? 
6133.133,"If you can't stick with something, "
6134.29,then it's not very worthwhile. 
6136.02,"But from the purely scientific standpoint, "
6139.11,there's also an advantage to keeping insulin low. 
6142.94,"Now, that doesn't necessarily mean "
6144.09,you go to zero carbohydrate. 
6145.7,I've talked before about my preferred way of eating 
6148.12,is to go lower or no carbohydrates throughout the day 
6150.27,for alertness to get that adrenaline release and the focus 
6153.44,"that goes with it, et cetera, "
6154.71,and the ability to think and move 
6156.59,and do all the things I need to do during the day. 
6158.45,And then I eat carbohydrates at night 
6159.9,'cause it facilitates the transition to sleep. 
6161.76,That's what works for me. 
6163.82,"But when insulin is low, "
6166.73,you do place your system in a position to oxidize more fat. 
6172.12,And so that's why I think a lot of people do see benefit 
6174.76,"from lower carbohydrate or moderate carbohydrate diets, "
6177.94,"because when insulin is low, "
6179.44,you are in a position to oxidize more fat. 
6182.3,Both from exercise and at rest. 
6184.68,"And I should mention, because I often mention "
6187.44,and it's appropriate to mention 
6188.71,that if you're interested in looking at the effects 
6190.96,"of caffeine, of mate, guayusa things of that sort, "
6194.7,GLP-
1,you want to learn more about those. 
6197.01,You can go to this wonderful website 
6198.75,which is free www.examine.com. 
6202.36,"You can put in yerba mate, "
6203.81,it will describe the three studies 
6206.15,"that show increased fat oxidation, "
6209.48,"both during exercise and at rest, "
6211.81,and as a consequence not surprisingly and increase 
6214.4,in metabolic rate. 
6215.798,One thing that's interesting about mate 
6218.96,is it causes a slight decrease in heart rate 
6221.84,for reasons that still escape me. 
6224.67,There's a single study showing 
6226.47,that heart rate is slightly reduced 
6229.5,"which is kind of nice because if, "
6231.07,when I drink too much caffeine 
6232.31,"my heart rate goes up, "
6233.29,"maybe that would increase my fidgeting and my fat burning, "
6235.73,but I don't like the feeling of having my basal heart rate 
6238.14,being up too high. 
6239.31,"I like my heart rate elevate during exercise, "
6241.24,but not when I'm just kind of resting 
6242.73,or working and throughout the day. 
6244.43,And for some reason that I don't understand 
6247.89,there's an effect of mate of increasing fat oxidation 
6251.84,but reducing heart rate just slightly. 
6254.56,So that's interesting. 
6255.59,And it probably lends itself [indistinct] 
6258.31,explains the subjective experience 
6259.82,that I've had of that mate has kind of a little nice 
6261.73,even mellow stimulant. 
6264.48,It's not this really supercharged stimulant like caffeine 
6268.48,from coffee or other sources. 
6270.2,Although if you drink too much mate 
6271.4,it will also make you jittery. 
6273.86,And there's one more compound that I think we should discuss 
6276.63,"in terms of increasing fat loss, "
6278.59,"and that's carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine, "
6281.75,they lie in the same pathway. 
6284.47,We can return to our basic knowledge now of fat mobilization 
6288.73,and oxidation. 
6290.61,After fat is mobilized and makes it into cells 
6294.28,and needs to be oxidized. 
6295.71,So the literally the burning of fat 
6297.65,and conversion of it into energy 
6300.45,that is accomplished and is facilitated 
6304.6,"by the presence of glucagon being elevated, "
6308.47,GLP increases that process and insulin being low. 
6314.98,And we talked about some ways to manage insulin 
6318.12,both in this episode and in previous episode. 
6321.8,L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine 
6324.9,in particular facilitates fat oxidation. 
6329.4,It helps convert fatty acids into ATP. 
6333.2,And indeed supplementing L-carnitine can increase fat loss. 
6336.93,That's been shown. 
6339.15,At what dosages? 
6340.55,"Well, people ingest anywhere from "
500,milligrams 
6343.681,to two grams per day in divided doses typically. 
6347.95,Some people who are really extreme 
6349.65,"are taking injectable L-carnitine, "
6352.67,I've certainly not tried that. 
6355.38,I confess I have used it in pill form from time to time 
6358.07,"but in part, because of the fat oxidation effects, "
6361.16,but also because of the other effects that it tends to have. 
6364.42,"So in exploring the effects that acetyl-L-carnitine has, "
6367.73,it has a huge variety of effects on cellar metabolism. 
6371.18,It can reduce ammonia in the blood 
6374.01,that is actually a quite strong effect. 
6376.01,"It can reduce things like C-reactive protein, "
6378.09,which is you want to C-reactive protein levels 
6381.31,to be managed. 
6382.16,You do not want them too high. 
6383.43,Can slightly reduce blood glucose. 
6386.37,"I can slightly increase HDLC, "
6388.74,the good form of the blood lipid 
6391.49,and slightly reduce overall cholesterol. 
6394.02,"And as I mentioned, it can slightly modify "
6398.2,"the pathway involving glucagon, "
6400.15,"such that you get a considerable effect, "
6401.89,"not a huge effect on fat oxidation, "
6404.06,so it can improve pat oxidation rates. 
6406.71,"It has a number of other effects, "
6408.09,some of which I talked during the month on hormones 
6411.65,and that sort of thing. 
6413.75,It has strong effects on rates of pregnancy 
6417.12,and sperm quality. 
6418.19,So clearly carnitine is doing lots of different things 
6420.47,and lots of different cells. 
6422.06,It's impacting sperm motility. 
6424.02,They're in a large number of studies supporting that. 
6427.09,Slight reductions in blood pressure 
6429.56,and has these interesting effects on reducing fatigue 
6432.732,"during exercise, "
6434.1,reducing inflammatory markers like interleukin 
6.,
6437.04,So it has a number of effects that on the whole 
6439.87,are quote unquote positive or at least in the direction 
6442.76,of things that you may want. 
6444.2,And I should emphasize may. 
6445.53,You certainly don't need a acetyl-L-carnitine 
6447.73,"in order to lose fat, "
6450.2,but now that you understand the cellular process 
6453.3,"by which fat is mobilized and oxidized, "
6456.03,it should make sense that if L-carnitine 
6457.84,"is important for converting fatty acids into energy, "
6462.71,then supplementing L-carnitine make sense. 
6467.02,Acetyl-L-carnitine is the type of L-carnitine 
6470.55,"or the form of L-carnitine I should say, "
6472.46,that is transported and utilized most easily by the body. 
6476.437,And so that's why sometimes we distinguish 
6478.26,between L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine. 
6481.21,"So once again, we've covered an enormous amount of material. "
6485.6,We've talked about the science of fat loss 
6488.58,"and in particular, we've explored this topic "
6491.73,from the perspective of the nervous system. 
6494.48,How neurons and in particular the release of things 
6497.56,"like adrenaline, epinephrin can facilitate fat mobilization "
6502.84,and oxidation. 
6504.38,"We talked about NEAT, fidgeting, "
6507.09,this non-exercise type movement 
6510.68,that can greatly increase caloric burn. 
6513.97,And why that is. 
6515.65,"We talked about shiver, "
6516.78,another form of non-exercise movement 
6519.73,that can really increase both caloric expenditure 
6522.83,"due to the shiver, due to the movement, "
6524.8,as well as increase thermogenesis the heating up of the body 
6529.05,"through things like brown fat, "
6530.44,and even the conversion of white fat to brown fat 
6533.36,which is a good thing if you want to oxidize fat. 
6536.77,We talked about cold as a particular stimulus 
6539.212,"to induce shiver and how to use getting into, "
6543.99,an out of cold as a way to stimulate shiver 
6547.17,and avoid cold adaptation so that you continue 
6550.55,"to oxidize and burn fat, if that's your goal. "
6553.86,"If you want to check out the protocols for that, "
6556.57,there at www.thecoldplunge.com 
6559.11,and in weeks to come we're going to be adding 
6561.5,more protocols to that website 
6563.26,"not just for fat loss, "
6564.73,"but for things like resilience, "
6566.357,"reducing inflammation, et cetera. "
6568.6,"So be sure to check those out again, "
6569.99,those are totally cost-free. 
6572.07,Talked about exercise. 
6573.9,How rather than thinking about cardiovascular 
6576.3,"or weight training exercise, "
6578.13,that we should perhaps look through the lens 
6580.75,of this adrenaline system and how it interacts 
6582.81,"with fat stores and think about low, medium "
6586.21,or high intensity exercise. 
6588.05,Whether or not we show up to that fasted or not. 
6590.01,"Turns out showing up to that fasted can be useful, "
6593.27,if you start with high intensity movements 
6595.92,and then move into lower intensity type exercise. 
6600.52,"If you're going to go long duration, "
6602.27,it probably doesn't matter unless you're exercising longer 
6605.04,than 
90,"minutes, whether or not you eat or not. "
6608.83,We talked about caffeine as a stimulant 
6612.01,and a stimulus for epinephrin and adrenaline release 
6616.35,as a way to access more fat metabolism. 
6620.0,And we talked about compounds 
6621.78,"that come from things like yerba mate and guayusa tea, "
6625.91,this GLP-
1,pathway that can trigger increased fat oxidation 
6630.88,so much so that the pharmaceutical companies 
6632.97,are now developing compounds specifically 
6634.93,to increase GLP-
1,for treatment of diabetes and obesity. 
6639.37,But you can leverage the GLP-
1,pathway 
6641.85,through the ingestion of things like mate 
6643.68,or guayusa if that's of interest to you. 
6647.06,And then we talked about L-carnitine 
6648.93,and how L-carnitine itself is critical 
6651.84,for the fat oxidation within individual cells. 
6654.21,The conversion of fatty acids to energy. 
6656.88,And why having your insulin low 
6660.34,and things like L-carnitine and glucagon levels 
6663.53,high or sufficient at least can facilitate 
6667.697,"the burning of fat, fat oxidation. "
6670.58,So we covered a lot of material. 
6671.78,That's a lot of protocols I realize that didn't... 
6675.03,The little list I just gave right there 
6676.43,didn't even begin to get into all the details 
6679.13,and corners that we discussed. 
6680.503,I hope you found this conversation interesting 
6683.81,both for sake of understanding fat loss 
6686.21,"and how to lose fat more quickly and to lose more of it, "
6689.14,if that's your goal. 
6690.83,As well as simply to understand the biology 
6693.25,"of fat metabolism from a different perspective, "
6695.25,from the perspective of the nervous system.
