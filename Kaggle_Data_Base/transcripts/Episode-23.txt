0.179 welcome to the huberman Lab podcast
1.92 where we discuss science and
3.959 science-based tools for everyday life
9.12 I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor
11.16 of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
13.559 Stanford school of medicine today my
15.599 guest is Dr Casey Halpern Dr Halpern is
18.6 the chief of neurosurgery at the
20.1 University of Pennsylvania School of
21.66 Medicine his laboratory focuses on
24.3 bulimia binge eating disorder and other
27.06 forms of obsessive-compulsive behaviors
29.16 normally when we hear about eating
30.96 disorders or obsessive-compulsive
32.46 disorders of other kinds the
34.2 conversation quickly migrates to
35.76 pharmacologic interventions and
37.739 serotonin or dopamine or talk therapy
40.68 interventions many of which can be
42.18 effective
43.14 The Halpern laboratory however takes an
45.3 entirely different approach while they
46.98 Embrace pharmacologic and behavioral and
48.78 talk therapy interventions their main
50.76 focus is the development and application
52.86 of engineered devices to go directly
55.379 into the brain and stimulate the neurons
57.18 the nerve cells that generate
58.98 compulsions that cause people to want to
62.1 eat more even when their stomach is full
64.14 in other words they do brain surgery of
67.32 various kinds sometimes removing small
69.24 bits of brain sometimes stimulating
70.979 small bits of brain with electrical
72.78 current and even stimulating the brain
74.939 through the intact skull that is without
76.74 having to drill down beneath the skull
78.24 in order to alleviate and indeed
80.34 sometimes cure these conditions today's
82.439 discussion with Dr Halpern was an
84.18 absolutely fascinating one for me
85.619 because it represents the Leading Edge
87.96 of what's happening in modification of
90.06 brain circuits and the treatment of
91.68 neurologic and psychiatric disease for
94.14 instance they just recently published a
95.88 paper in nature medicine one of the
98.04 Premier journals out there
99.96 entitled pilot study of responsive
102.479 nucleus succumbings deep brain
103.86 stimulation for loss of control eating
105.84 the nucleus that Cummins is an area of
108.36 our brains that we all have in fact we
110.1 have two of them one on each side of the
111.54 brain that is intimately involved in the
114.299 release of dopamine for particular
116.22 motivated behaviors and while most often
118.32 we think about dopamine for the release
119.52 of behaviors that we want to engage in
121.32 in this context they are using
124.02 stimulation and control of neuronal
126.119 activity in nucleus accumbens to control
128.28 loss of control eating something that
130.92 when people suffer from it despite
132.54 knowing they shouldn't eat despite not
134.52 even wanting to eat they find themselves
136.14 eating so again this represents really
138.42 the Leading Edge of where Neuroscience
140.04 is going and certainly is going to be an
142.08 area of Neuroscience that's going to
143.28 expand in the years to come and Dr
145.2 Halpern and the members of his
146.76 laboratory are among a very small group
148.98 of scientists in the world that are
150.72 using the types approaches that I
152.099 described a minute ago and that you're
153.599 going to hear more about in today's
154.62 episode in order to resolve some of the
156.78 most difficult and debilitating human
158.7 conditions during today discussion you
161.04 will also learn about the use of deep
162.42 brain stimulation and other approaches
164.22 for the treatment of movement disorders
166.26 such as essential tremor Parkinson's
168.84 disease and various types of dystonias
170.94 which are challenges in generating
172.5 particular types of movement so whether
174.72 or not you or somebody that you know
176.4 suffers from an eating disorder from
178.44 obsessive-compulsive disorder or from a
180.48 movement disorder today's episode is
182.58 sure to teach you not only about what's
184.44 happening in those Arenas but also in
187.08 the Arenas of Neuroscience generally in
189.0 fact I would say today's episode is
190.44 especially important for anyone that
191.94 wants to understand how the brain works
194.099 and what the future of brain
195.959 modification really looks like for all
198.54 of us before we begin I'd like to
200.64 emphasize that this podcast is separate
202.5 from my teaching and research roles at
204.0 Stanford it is however part of my desire
206.34 and effort to bring zero cost to
208.08 Consumer information about science and
209.819 science related tools to the general
211.44 public in keeping with that theme I'd
213.72 like to thank the sponsors of today's
215.22 podcast our first sponsor is Roca Roca
218.64 makes eyeglasses and sunglasses they're
220.68 of the absolute highest quality the
222.54 company was founded by two All-American
224.099 swimmers from Stanford and everything
225.84 about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses
227.76 were created with performance in mind
230.4 I've spent a lifetime working on the
232.14 biology the visual system and I can tell
233.7 you that your visual system has to
234.9 contend with a number of very important
236.58 challenges in order for you to be able
238.44 to see clearly for instance when you go
240.36 from a sunny area to a more shaded area
242.099 and then back out again it's a very
243.54 complex process Roca eyeglasses and
245.76 sunglasses were built that is engineered
248.4 with that sort of biology in mind and as
250.739 a consequence no matter where you are
252.78 wearing them and where you happen to be
254.099 you always see through them with Crystal
255.78 Clarity the aesthetic of Roca eyeglasses
258.0 and sunglasses is also worth mentioning
259.62 unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses
261.72 out there which only come in the kind of
263.46 cyborg variety
264.9 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in
266.82 those varieties but they also come in
268.199 varieties that you would feel very
269.699 comfortable wearing out to dinner or to
271.199 work or to school really anywhere that
272.94 you go if you'd like to try Roca

286.74 also brought To Us by eight sleep eight
288.66 sleep makes mattress covers with cooling
290.4 Heating and sleep tracking ability I've
292.62 talked many times before on this podcast
294.24 about the close relationship between
296.34 temperature and your ability to stay
298.08 asleep and emerge from sleep the way Aid
300.6 Sleep mattress covers work is that they
301.979 allow you to program the temperature of
303.9 your mattress so that you can fall
306.06 asleep quickly get into deep sleep stay
308.88 in deep sleep and emerge from that sleep
310.62 feeling especially rested by dropping
313.259 the temperature of that Surface by one
314.759 to three degrees at the beginning of the
316.08 night dropping it a little bit further
317.82 into the night and then raising the
319.44 temperature towards morning because
320.4 waking up requires that one to three
321.96 degree re- increase in body temperature
324.18 I've been sleeping on an eight-sleep
325.919 mattress cover for the last six months
327.72 or so now and I can assert that it is
330.24 the absolute biggest Game Changer in the
333.24 quality and duration of my sleep in fact
334.86 I don't really like traveling as much as
336.479 I used to because the eight sleep
338.4 doesn't go with me and they don't seem
339.539 to have them yet in airbnbs and hotels
341.28 so this is also a call to action airbnbs
343.68 and hotels please put eight sleep
345.12 mattresses on your beds and I'll be more
347.82 apt to stay in those hotels and airbnbs
350.759 with that said if you'd like to try an

376.32 is a personalized nutrition platform
377.759 that analyzes data from your blood and
379.68 DNA to help you better understand your
381.66 body and help you reach your health
382.919 goals now I've long been a believer in
385.259 getting regular blood work done for the
386.759 simple reason that many of the factors
388.8 that impact your immediate and long-term
390.479 Health can only be assessed with a
392.52 quality blood test one of the major
394.02 issues with the various blood tests out
395.58 there is that you get information back
397.44 about lipids and hormones and metabolic
399.66 factors Etc but you don't know what to
401.759 do with that information with inside
403.5 tracker they make knowing what to do
405.06 with the information you get about your
406.56 biological health extremely easy they
409.08 have this very easy to use dashboard and
411.419 that dashboard tells you for instance
413.039 what to change in your nutrition what
415.199 supplements you may want or may not want
417.36 to take as well as other behavioral and
419.34 other types of interventions that can
420.72 allow you to move those numbers related
422.58 to metabolic hormone and other factors
424.68 into the precise range that's optimal

440.639 huberman Lab podcast we talk about
442.139 supplements while supplements aren't
444.06 necessary for everyone buddy many people
445.919 derive tremendous benefit from them
447.479 things like enhancing sleep and the
449.639 depth of sleep or for enhancing focus
451.8 and cognitive ability or for enhancing
453.96 energy or adjusting hormone levels to
456.78 Optimal range for you the huberman Lab
458.759 podcast is now partnered with momentous
460.44 supplements we partner with momentous
462.24 for a number of important reasons first
464.16 of all the quality of their ingredients
466.02 is exceptional it's really Second To
467.88 None second of all they ship
469.56 internationally and that was important
471.12 to us because a number of you reside
472.56 outside of the United States third we've
474.84 worked with momentous very closely to
476.94 develop single ingredient formulations
478.8 now this turns out to be very important
480.66 because if you're going to take
481.919 supplements
483.06 you want to know what's working for you
484.919 and what isn't and of course you want to
486.78 optimize the cost efficiency and the
490.02 biological efficiency of those
491.28 supplements to find the supplements we
492.96 discussed on the huberman Lab podcast
494.28 you can go to live momentous spelled ous
496.56 live momentous.com huberman and I should
499.979 just mention that the library of those
501.3 supplements is constantly expanding
502.979 again that's livemomentis.com huberman
506.039 and now for my discussion with Dr Casey
508.56 Halpern Casey I should say Dr Halpern
512.159 listening welcome thank you great to be
515.219 here yeah it's been a long time coming
517.44 we were colleagues at Stanford and then
520.14 recently you moved of course to
521.94 University of Pennsylvania also an
523.8 incredible institution we're sorry to
525.779 lose you so it was better sweet for me
527.399 too Stanford's loss is upenn's gain but
530.64 um let's talk about your work uh past
533.64 and present
535.74 as I've told the listeners already
537.72 you're a neurosurgeon which I consider
539.88 the astronauts of Neuroscience because
541.92 you're in somewhat Uncharted Territory
544.38 or very Uncharted Territory and yet
546.36 Precision is everything right the
549.24 margins of error are very very small so
552.72 for those that aren't familiar with the
554.519 differences between neurosurgery
555.66 neurology Psychiatry you just educate us
559.2 a bit what does a neurosurgeon do and
562.2 what does
564.36 fact that you're a nurse surgeon do for
566.88 your view of the brain how do you think
568.5 about and conceptualize the brain
570.66 yeah the scope of neurosurgery is quite
573.06 broad uh when I was in medical school I
576.0 I was drawn to neurosurgery because of a
578.04 procedure known as deep brain
579.3 stimulation when I was at Penn as a
582.36 college student I actually watched my
583.86 first deep brain stimulation surgery
585.66 performed by Gordon boltuck who to date
588.06 is one of my career mentors
590.16 deep brain stimulation is a one surgery
593.22 that neurosurgeons offer but it's
595.5 actually sort of
597.12 a very small minority of what
599.7 neurosurgery does
602.66 you know we take out brain tumors we
605.1 clip aneurysms in the brain
607.399 we take care of patients that have had
609.54 traumatic brain injury concussion spine
612.899 surgeries ninety percent of what
614.94 neurosurgeons do around the country uh
617.16 you know taking care of herniated discs
619.14 and lumbar fusions so you know the scope
623.279 is
624.12 the entire central nervous system
626.22 include including the peripheral nervous
627.72 system we take care of patients with
628.92 carpal tunnel syndrome and nerve
630.779 disorders
632.04 now over the course of the past two
634.74 decades or so there's been a a mission
637.019 in the field to to sub-specialize and so
640.38 historically neurosurgeons did
642.54 everything in that domain but now we
645.3 sub-specialize and I'm lucky to be at
647.519 Penn Medicine where we can focus on one
652.26 of these areas so I'm chief of
655.68 stereotactic functional Neurosurgery
658.14 all I do is deep brain stimulation
660.06 surgery and a compliment to that is
662.04 focus ultrasound or transcranial Focus
664.56 ultrasound which is a non-invasive way
666.66 to do an ablation in the brain recently
669.0 FDA approved and it's FDA approved for
671.339 Trevor at the moment uh these two
674.399 procedures are for me my every day but
679.32 uh still the minority of what
681.36 neurosurgeons have to offer the majority
683.76 of neurosurgery in my mind is is a bit
686.64 more structural than it is
689.579 physiology or
691.74 deeply rooted in how the brain functions
694.579 when we take out a brain tumor we have
696.959 to find a a safe trajectory to get to
700.32 the brain tumor and then we remove it
701.82 and we help the patient recover in the
704.16 ICU similar to a brain aneurysm often we
707.1 don't have to go into the brain to clip
708.54 a brain aneurysm but we go around the
710.22 brain or under the brain to get there
712.56 and in my mind those surgeries are a bit
714.3 more structural
716.339 deep brain stimulation the surgery that
718.68 I do routinely is a procedure where yes
723.12 there is structure involved of course we
725.339 have to place a a very thin wire that's
728.82 insulated deep into a part of the brain
732.06 that's involved in Parkinson's disease
734.279 for example uh
736.44 but that's actually not the therapy the
738.36 therapy is delivering electrical
740.82 stimulation through the tip of that wire
743.1 or one of the tips as there actually are
745.62 multiple contacts at the bottom of the
747.3 wire they're very small
749.22 uh
750.6 but that's all done out of the operating
752.459 room you know this stimulation wire is
754.92 connected to a a battery pack or a pulse
757.32 generator that's kind of like a
758.76 pacemaker and so we deliver this therapy
761.16 and I always tell patients it's a bit
763.139 more like I have to implant a uh a tool
766.68 to deliver you a medication but that
769.38 medication is going to be in the form of
770.94 electricity and it's going to be
772.32 delivered into a very small region of
774.12 the brain and it's that procedure that's
776.279 inspired me to not just become a
778.5 neurosurgeon but has really defined the
781.92 focus of my research laboratory as well
785.88 Maybe by way of antidote you could tell
789.72 us one of the more outrageous or
793.26 surprising or who knows um delightful
796.62 and thrilling things about the brain
798.06 that you've observed as a consequence of
800.639 stimulating different brain areas you
802.56 know in textbooks we always hear about
804.42 uh the kind of dark stuff you know
806.88 stimulate one brain area somebody goes
808.68 into a rage stimulate another brain area
810.66 a person starts laughing uncontrollably
813.019 first of all
814.86 um given that some of the information
816.2 let's hope not much but some of the
818.279 information in textbooks is incorrect is
819.899 are those sorts of statements true can
822.12 one observe those in the clinic and what
825.0 are some of the more interesting uh and
827.7 I don't necessarily mean entertaining
829.32 but
830.16 um surprising things that you've seen
831.42 when you've poked around in the brain
833.42 deliberately of course and uh
836.459 what have you seen what have you heard
838.8 I have to say I I am amazed by these
841.98 effects uh every day yeah I'm very
843.899 privileged to be able to interact with
845.76 the human brain in this way it's always
847.2 in them with the goal of trying to
849.72 provide somebody with a meaningful
851.459 therapy but when we deliver electrical
853.38 stimulation
855.42 you know the these electrodes while they
857.339 might be sitting in a very small region
859.139 of the brain there are regions
861.12 within a few millimeters of where these
863.04 electrodes are that if stimulated could
865.32 cause a temporary very brief side effect
868.079 a moment of laughter like you said or a
870.54 moment of panic and of course we can
872.04 just shut that electrode off but often
874.8 these side effects could be therapeutic
877.2 and actually that's how we have
878.7 discovered ways to use deep brain
880.5 stimulation not just for movement
883.019 disorders like Parkinson's disease but
884.579 for example patients with Parkinson's
886.32 disease that have a psychiatric uh uh
891.06 comorbidity like depression or
893.3 obsessive-compulsive disorder a lot of
895.26 these patients are highly compulsive and
898.44 impulsive
900.54 sometimes these problems actually melt
903.24 away and we're trying to help their
904.74 Tremor but the patients also tell us
906.779 that their gambling issue has gotten
908.399 better or their mood has improved and
910.5 why is that well you know there's
912.36 probably more than one reason you know
913.86 you can help somebody's Mood by making
915.42 their Tremor go away of course but we
917.699 see laughter in the clinic sometimes and
920.22 and why is that and that's because we're
922.079 stimulating parts of the brain that are
923.94 not just involved in these motor
925.56 circuits but they're also involved in
927.6 what we call a limbic circuit or part of
929.76 the brain involved in emotion and if we
931.74 learn how to modulate those areas
934.68 therapeutically step by step we can
937.079 actually develop these therapies for
938.699 other indications like depression I
941.16 would say the most impressive and
943.26 consistent effect we have when we have a
945.0 patient with Tremor who has been
946.74 tremming for the past 20 years if we can
948.6 deliver stimulation through that
949.86 electrode in the clinic we have
951.72 immediate relief of Tremor and that is
954.779 the effect that inspired me to be a
956.519 neurosurgeon when I was in college I've
958.199 never really wanted to do anything else
959.94 X accept help develop that type of
963.24 therapeutic for another another kind of
965.639 symptom I'm very interested in obesity
968.16 and related Eating Disorders compulsive
970.68 Behavior the urge to uh to to have
974.279 something that might be delicious but
976.92 dangerous or unhealthy or a drug or a
982.199 compulsion like we see in OCD or pests
985.019 of compulsive disorder uh interestingly
988.16 like we see Tremor melt away when we
990.72 deliver electricity to a certain part of
993.24 the brain we can see these psychiatric
995.76 more psychiatric problems they're not
997.44 all psychiatric disorders but let's say
1000.339 disorders of the brain we can see
1002.72 symptoms of those disorders also improve
1004.699 and often immediately just like we do
1006.62 with Tremor so I see it all the time to
1010.16 to pick out one uh would be would be a
1012.8 challenge because for me this is my my
1015.139 everyday
1016.639 the speed of the relief that you
1018.62 described for Tremor is really
1020.839 um incredible just thinking about drug
1023.48 therapies and there too there are side
1025.64 effects but they're still a lot of
1028.52 mysteries as to for instance why ssris
1030.62 even work when they work
1033.199 and the timing is always
1035.959 a challenge timing dosage yes absolutely
1039.559 um I'd love to learn more from you about
1042.26 OCD I I have several reasons for asking
1045.439 this first of all I'm a somewhat
1047.179 obsessive person I tend to be very very
1049.94 narrowly focused although I confess it's
1051.98 not a step function it takes me some
1053.84 time to turn off the chatter but once
1055.46 I'm into a thought train or a mode of
1057.44 being uh and thinking and work it's very
1061.1 hard for me to exit that that mode it's
1063.2 like a deep Trench
1064.88 adaptive in some circumstances less
1066.86 adaptive than others as you know the
1068.84 other is that when I was a kid uh I had
1070.94 a little bit of a grunting tick I used
1072.98 to I had a this intense intense desire
1076.58 to clear my throat
1079.16 um to the point where my my dad said
1081.38 like you need to stop that he used to
1082.94 squeeze my hand every time I do it and I
1084.5 used to hide in the back seat of the car
1085.94 in the closet to do it because it
1087.44 provided so much relief and then it
1090.02 eventually passed yes I wasn't medicated
1091.76 they never did anything about it every
1093.86 once in a while now if I'm very fatigued
1096.98 if I've been working a lot I notice it
1098.72 starts to come back I'll do this like
1100.7 kind of grunting and so it's been sort
1103.16 of like a pet neurological symptom for
1106.22 me that reminds me that these these
1108.86 circuits exist in all of us and that
1111.86 sometimes they go haywire and sometimes
1113.48 they just have subtle um you know over
1115.88 excitation or something of that sort and
1118.16 then the third reason is that I get
1119.72 thousands of questions about OCD could
1122.48 you perhaps just tell us what is OCD
1124.88 sure um what are some brain areas
1127.28 involved what are the current range of
1129.86 treatments and
1131.9 what's the difference between someone
1133.34 who is obsessive and somebody who has
1135.86 true OCD
1137.78 so a brief disclosure as a neurosurgeon
1140.6 I do take care of patients with severe
1142.66 obsessive-compulsive disorder
1145.16 um but my perspective on OCD may be a
1148.16 little bit different than a psychiatrist
1149.9 who who lives and breathes OCD and sees
1152.78 patients every single day with OCD I'd
1156.2 probably take care of a three to five
1158.12 patients a year with deep brain
1159.74 stimulation for obsessive-compulsive
1161.9 disorders so I don't see these patients
1163.46 as routinely but my laboratory is geared
1165.919 as a researcher I'm very focused on
1168.799 trying to improve outcomes of deep brain
1171.679 stimulation for for OCD so I do feel I
1174.799 have expertise and and a perspective to
1177.5 share but just a brief disclosure I
1182.96 I do feel that as a neurosurgeon I am
1186.82 obligated to better understand where the
1190.34 obsessions in the brain come from and
1192.14 how we can interrupt them to stop the
1194.059 compulsion that's associated with the
1196.039 obsession
1197.12 sort of the intrinsic
1199.34 most feature of OCD uh better than we're
1203.0 actually doing it for example if we were
1205.7 to offer a patient with Tremor deep
1208.7 brain stimulation surgery of course
1210.559 there's some risk to the procedure but
1212.299 the outcome is so consistent and
1214.88 positive that many patients are willing
1217.16 to take on that risk
1218.799 uh for obsessive compulsion compulsive
1221.6 disorder the
1224.0 surgery risk is about the same however
1227.299 the benefit is not quite as robust
1230.36 and so a lot of patients and they're
1232.16 referring psychiatrists are reluctant to
1234.26 refer these patients to us and it's
1236.059 completely understandable uh I've been
1238.82 leading an Endeavor with a number of
1241.16 collaborators around the country to try
1242.96 to
1244.34 better understand these circuits in the
1246.98 brain uh study them in humans both
1249.74 invasively and non-invasively that would
1251.84 be with an electrode-based surgery sort
1254.419 of like we do at epilepsy to understand
1255.62 where seizures come from we want to
1257.539 understand better where obsessions come
1258.679 from but we're also working with imaging
1260.48 experts and geneticists to understand
1262.16 OCD at a broader level as well
1266.179 uh I I consider OCD to be a a spectrum
1270.62 disorder in a way uh and I I apologize
1273.98 to those who who might feel that I'm
1276.44 using that term incorrectly I'm using it
1279.62 in a way to describe
1281.6 patients that have obsessions and even
1283.58 some related compulsions might not meet
1285.62 criteria for OCD it may be something
1288.86 Andrew that that you have and as a
1291.2 neurosurgeon I'm really obsessive about
1293.539 safety and compulsive about my surgical
1295.94 procedures so you know I I think that
1298.88 some aspect of OCD which we often joke
1301.039 about but we should you know consider
1302.6 seriously because people do suffer from
1304.159 this uh some aspect of it helps us there
1308.299 are you know famous uh CEOs that
1311.48 probably have some level of OCD uh
1314.78 surgeons and scientists alike so perhaps
1318.32 if it can be controlled it's an asset
1320.36 and uh but if it goes awry and is
1324.44 uncontrollable then it becomes
1326.32 obsessive-compulsive disorder and I tend
1330.14 to see the patients that are the most
1331.34 severe so they have failed medication
1333.32 and there are multiple medications that
1335.36 are worth trying for OCD some can
1337.159 actually be very helpful which
1338.6 neurotransmitter systems do they tend to
1340.88 poke at well ssris are sort of the the
1343.58 first line for OCD but also tricyclics
1346.64 can be helpful so this is still the
1348.02 serotonin system but as we know the
1350.84 serotonin system interacts with the you
1353.12 know neurogenergic system and the
1355.1 dopamine system so it's hard to
1358.179 be specific to one of these things and I
1361.88 think that's also why it's hard for us
1363.62 to predict how these medications are
1365.9 going to to work for these kinds of
1367.4 patients but tricyclics and ssris can be
1370.7 very helpful and are definitely first
1372.26 line and there's others exposure
1375.38 response prevention is uh probably the
1378.74 most effective option which is kind of
1380.48 like cognitive behavioral therapy but
1381.919 these are different and offered by
1383.48 psychologists and this is a whole field
1385.94 and there's a a field or I should say a
1389.12 whole clinic at my institution
1391.72 focused it was started by Edna foa
1395.14 at Penn who
1397.7 this is what they do for these patients
1399.74 uh is offer these types of cognitive
1402.2 therapies exposure to the stressor and
1405.74 to try to get patients to habituate to
1407.6 whatever it is that stresses them and
1409.159 causes these uh compulsions to help
1411.919 these patients live in every day and
1414.08 function these are all fabulously
1417.62 helpful therapies for a variety of
1419.84 patients but there's still about 30 of
1422.299 patients that still suffer from OCD and
1424.58 some of them have severe OCD sometimes
1426.679 it's moderate to severe and those are
1428.539 the patients that I'm really motivated
1430.64 to try to help
1432.08 um our therapies for those patients
1433.7 right now I would say are are worth
1436.46 pursuing but not optimal
1438.98 um and so it's it's one of those things
1440.96 that we have to balance as a researcher
1442.46 because when you see patients like this
1444.02 you want to do everything you can to
1445.52 help them and I think it's important to
1446.78 educate patients on the risks and
1448.94 benefits of them this is deep brain
1450.86 stimulation surgery but also capsulotomy
1452.9 which is more of an ablation approach a
1455.059 little bit like deep brain stimulation
1456.5 but rather than delivering stimulation
1458.36 through an electrode you can actually
1459.62 heat the tissue and even destroy it some
1462.44 would say this part of the brain is very
1464.179 safe to destroy it's kind of like an
1465.919 appendix
1467.419 um others would say it's safer to
1469.039 modulate I have seen patients do very
1471.62 well with these ablations and so you
1474.44 know you asked me earlier what what I
1475.94 find so amazing about the brain these
1477.62 effects that we can have sometimes the
1479.419 lack of effect is what's so amazing you
1482.0 can actually
1483.22 Traverse parts of the brain without
1485.24 having any adverse effects on patients
1487.28 function at least that you can test but
1490.64 you can also destroy small parts of the
1492.2 brain we're talking three or four
1493.7 millimeters in size these little
1495.08 ablations can be really helpful for
1497.059 patients but have no obvious side
1498.799 effects that we can tell perhaps after a
1500.9 short recovery from surgery but
1503.299 nonetheless despite how safe they might
1504.86 be these surgical procedures still are
1507.08 surgical procedures and patients are
1509.48 hesitant to perceived especially when
1511.28 they know that their chance of a
1512.9 transformative effect is quite low we
1515.059 can generally
1517.78 achieve a responder rate of about 50
1520.1 percent and responders still have
1522.98 symptomatic OCD so I'm really uh sort of
1527.48 inspired to really find a way to deliver
1530.299 these therapies in a more disease
1532.34 specific or symptom-specific way but
1535.039 we're years away probably from from that
1537.44 therapy since it's all part of a
1538.88 research study at the moment
1540.5 what brain areas should I think about
1542.9 when I think about OCD years ago I
1544.88 remember opening a textbook I think it
1547.039 was an undergraduate still and work from
1549.38 Judith Rappaport at the National
1550.82 Institutes of mental health this would
1552.32 be late 80s early 90s was
1555.62 um had done some neuroimaging or maybe
1557.72 it was pet
1559.52 or some other Imaging technique and had
1562.4 identified portions of the basal ganglia
1564.26 sure caudi putanum type structures in
1567.98 OCD and maybe some differences in boys
1571.76 versus girls so what brain areas are
1574.22 there sex differences in terms of OCD
1576.14 and were one to
1579.14 come into your clinic this you know for
1581.419 this sort of a work of ablations or
1584.0 stimulation uh where would you first
1586.52 start to probe in the brain yeah you
1589.1 this is a uh
1591.74 a disorder of both cortex and the Sub
1595.22 sub cortex uh
1597.559 the cortical control areas areas that
1600.98 are involved in inhibitory control we
1603.26 have found to not function properly in
1605.9 patients with OCD so areas like the
1607.94 orbital frontal cortex and the
1609.44 prefrontal cortex if you image these
1611.779 areas or study them even in a a rodent
1615.26 model of OCD which quite honestly these
1617.419 models they model aspects of OCD but OCD
1620.9 is a human condition you can't really
1622.64 model this whole condition in a in a
1625.52 mouse or a wrap but perhaps you can
1627.62 model compulsive behavior in a rat sure
1630.2 and pulling out their hair yeah exactly
1632.299 you know that's that's not necessarily
1634.1 obsessive compulsive disorder but that
1636.08 is compulsive behavior and perhaps if
1638.179 you can ameliorate that in a rat that
1639.919 might be helpful for a patient with OCD
1641.539 but we have to approach animal modeling
1644.24 of OCD thoughtfully uh and and most
1647.0 scientists do I think uh when we study
1649.52 OCD in in models or in in humans with
1652.46 imaging and and we're trying to do it
1654.08 invasively with with electrodes like we
1656.24 do in epilepsy patients
1657.86 we find that areas in the cortex like
1660.38 the prefrontal and orbital frontal
1661.82 cortex are are not functioning they will
1663.38 the way they would in a non-oc patient
1665.36 they are often hyper functioning uh such
1668.779 that while you might say Well they're
1670.76 hyper functioning so aren't these
1671.96 patients you know functioning better
1674.6 that hyper focused yeah hyper focused
1677.0 exactly
1678.02 um no I I would say it's it's not so
1679.94 much an up or down it's more that
1681.32 they're just dysfunctional and we need
1683.539 to find a way to try to restore normal
1685.58 function to these areas it's not so much
1687.679 directional really
1689.12 um we tend to oversimplify brain
1691.7 function by thinking about it with
1693.02 directionality too much
1695.12 um unfortunately Imaging studies
1696.38 sometimes demonstrate activation or
1698.74 hypoactivation and that's where I think
1701.12 these kinds of things can be
1702.32 misconstrued but what I would call the
1704.84 cortical areas of OCD is that they're
1706.76 dysregulated and we need to find a way
1708.799 to try to normalize their function so uh
1711.26 the frontal lobe is is huge but areas of
1713.299 the frontal lobe that are a bit more
1714.38 basal like the ofc or orbital frontal
1716.539 cortex and the prefrontal cortex
1718.039 definitely consistently seem to be
1719.84 implicated in patients with OCD and then
1723.14 their projections to the subcortex this
1725.0 is the basal ganglia like you were
1726.38 saying caudi putamen or the dorsal
1728.779 striatum and these are interconnected
1730.039 with the ventral striatum this is an
1731.419 area of the brain that I uh focus a lot
1733.64 of my energy in um this is the
1735.38 ventralstratum which is not limited to
1737.539 but includes the nucleus accumbens this
1739.88 is an area of the brain that we know to
1742.46 be involved in gating reward seeking
1744.62 behavior when it's perturbed it seems to
1746.48 gait compulsive Behavior meaning a rat
1749.0 will pursue a reward despite punishment
1750.74 despite a foot shock for example and
1753.08 that can be uh similar to an OCD patient
1755.779 they will
1757.58 um check their home for safety until 3
1760.22 A.M in the morning and not sleep that
1761.659 night in a way that is similar to a rat
1765.08 seeking out a food reward uh despite a
1767.299 foot shock
1768.32 um doing something because of the urge
1770.48 but despite the risk and perhaps there
1774.559 is some normal
1776.36 judgment there we all have to take risks
1779.72 to function in everyday Society to be
1782.6 successful we have to take a risk
1784.779 to take care of patients with surgery
1786.799 there's some risk there we make a
1789.5 judgment call and that's not a condition
1792.62 that that's just normal but when our
1796.1 judgment is consistently sort of puts us
1800.0 at risk that's where we have something
1802.159 like OCD but OCD is also you know it's
1805.159 one of many conditions that suffer from
1807.26 these kinds of problems we tend to label
1808.88 them because they tend to present in a
1811.34 consistent way so we have patients with
1812.72 OCD that have hyper checking Behavior or
1817.539 contamination Behavior where they if
1819.86 they feel contaminated they'll wash
1821.36 their hands for hours repeatedly or if
1823.399 they drop their toothbrush on the floor
1824.779 this will lead to a compulsive behavior
1827.299 of cleaning a toothbrush or brushing
1829.34 your teeth consistently very very common
1831.14 symptoms that we see or signs that the
1833.419 patients report to us or or that we
1835.159 observe
1836.84 but you know patients with eating
1839.059 disorders they tend to if if they have
1841.88 binging disorder they'll overeat if they
1843.98 have bulimia they might Purge despite
1846.02 the risk of these things and so um
1848.84 addiction is is similar we we tend to
1851.0 drug seek if we're addicted
1853.399 um uh we'll we'll pay off a dealer uh in
1856.399 order to get our fix and despite the
1858.38 risk and and that type of urge despite
1861.32 the risk is something that I I've always
1862.76 been really interested in and it's a
1864.559 common denominator to all of these
1866.299 problems and if you think about these
1867.98 problems I mean these are some of the
1869.24 most common conditions in our society
1871.279 today I'd like to take a quick break and
1873.919 acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic
1875.899 greens athletic greens now called ag-1
1878.539 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
1881.12 that covers all of your foundational
1882.799 nutritional needs I've been taking
1884.779 athletic green since 2012 so I'm
1887.36 delighted that they're sponsoring the
1888.559 podcast the reason I started taking
1890.059 athletic greens and the reason I still
1891.679 take athletic greens once are usually
1893.72 twice a day is that it gets to be in the
1896.299 probiotics that I need for gut health
1898.1 our gut is very important it's populated
1900.26 by gut microbiota that communicate with
1902.899 the brain the immune system and
1904.159 basically all the biological systems of
1905.96 our body to strongly impact our
1908.12 immediate and long-term health
1909.74 and those probiotics and athletic greens
1911.779 are optimal and vital for microbiotic
1914.84 health in addition athletic greens
1916.88 contains a number of adaptogens vitamins
1918.62 and minerals that make sure that all of
1920.24 my foundational nutritional needs are
1921.919 met and it tastes great if you'd like to
1925.039 try athletic greens you can go to
1926.62 athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll
1929.779 give you five free travel packs that
1931.46 make it really easy to mix up athletic
1933.08 greens while you're on the road in the
1934.7 car on the plane Etc and they'll give
1936.74 you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2
1939.38 again that's athleticgreens.com huberman
1941.96 to get the five free travel packs and
1943.82 the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 I
1947.539 really appreciate that you're building
1948.86 this bridge from OCD to nucleus
1950.539 accumbens which is of course associated
1952.34 with reward in various forms and we'll
1954.62 get to that
1956.0 um I'll share a personal anecdote as a
1958.82 as a form of question when I was in
1961.94 college and studying a lot I relied on
1965.539 caffeine as a stimulant I've never
1968.299 really been into drugs or alcohol I've
1969.62 been Lucky in that sense I don't drink
1971.84 and I care less if alcohol disappeared
1974.0 never really liked recreational drugs so
1975.98 I was never drawn to them
1977.779 however when I was in college at the
1981.02 time there were these little epinephrine
1983.36 pills that were common in a lot of
1986.36 sports supplements these are like
1988.159 pre-workout type things yes not unlike
1990.74 energy drinks now which I completely
1992.24 avoid
1993.5 um and I had this experience of taking
1994.82 one of these and drinking some coffee
1996.559 and of course it gave me a lift in
1997.88 energy these are very similar to
1999.679 amphetamine they were legal over the
2001.36 counter at the time they're now either
2003.46 banned or illegal I do not recommend
2005.38 them and I had a lot of energy but what
2007.779 I noticed is that my grunting tick came
2010.24 back and I had I made one mistake I
2013.48 still think of this as one mistake which
2015.1 was
2016.12 um I engage in a superstitious Behavior
2017.98 I knocked on wood and then somehow it
2020.86 felt very rewarding like it gave me some
2022.84 totally irrational but internally
2025.419 rational sense of of security around I
2028.179 forget what I was knocking on wood about
2029.5 and I found that I couldn't break that
2031.659 knock on wood compulsion I felt I needed
2034.059 to knock on wood and so then I started
2035.559 sneaking knock on Woods like in mid-exam
2037.48 and studying and pretty soon I was
2040.24 knocking on wood often I developed a
2042.519 superstition
2043.659 and so I'm curious about the role of
2045.279 superstition and compulsion in the
2046.779 crossover there it makes sense logically
2048.82 to me but I was equally shocked to learn
2051.52 that when I stopped taking this
2053.44 stimulant which I was quite happy to to
2056.619 stop because it did make me feel too
2057.94 alert couldn't sleep well Etc
2059.98 that the Superstition went away as well
2062.619 and I'm guessing this has something to
2064.179 do with some of the reward circuitry as
2067.839 it's called related to stimulants
2071.26 again
2072.639 I am not encouraging anyone to take
2074.32 stimulants although healthy use of
2076.06 caffeine or safe use of caffeine might
2077.619 be the one universally accepted
2079.0 stimulant
2080.2 um it was really surprising to me how
2081.879 quickly this came on how quickly it
2085.599 engaged my my thinking and my behavior
2087.94 the obsessions and the compulsions and
2090.22 how quickly it turned off when I stopped
2092.98 taking this Sports stimulant or whatever
2095.44 it was I don't even remember I think it
2096.7 was some form of epinephrine ephedrine
2098.32 sure some saw epinephrine excuse me I
2100.66 misspoke ephedrine
2102.94 um
2103.54 is what I described sound totally
2105.64 outside the bounds of of uh logic or or
2109.9 am I imagining at all um no it did
2112.24 happen I'm certain it happened yeah no I
2113.98 don't think you're imagining it at all I
2115.48 you know this the grunting that you you
2117.88 mentioned to me you know first of all I
2119.56 didn't uh comment but you know that that
2122.38 sort of not to put a label on it but it
2124.18 sounds like a tick and you know ticks in
2127.359 in young males extremely common and they
2130.06 do tend to go away linking to like since
2132.22 I have a good friend who actually a
2133.96 famous neuroscientist I won't mention
2135.16 who it is who's worked very hard to
2136.78 suppress his his blinking tits and when
2139.42 he gets fatigued it comes back and and
2141.88 um he's very high functioning yes in his
2143.92 personal life and his professional life
2145.24 but but when you're talking to him and
2146.98 he starts doing this so you kind of
2148.359 start wondering like what's going on
2149.859 yeah yeah and it's unfortunate you know
2152.5 people with these problems especially as
2154.3 they get more severe then you get
2155.5 Tourette Syndrome you know it's hard to
2158.32 function in our society I have some
2160.3 friends that have Tourette I'll tell you
2161.98 I I'm just so inspired because there
2163.48 there so
2166.0 um they're so confident and you know
2169.18 people obviously notice these problems
2170.68 but they they just live their life and
2172.66 they're very successful and that's not
2174.88 typical
2176.079 um I have I have friends that I went to
2177.88 Penn with undergrad that had these kinds
2179.5 of problems and I was always just so
2181.06 happy and inspired by them but what's
2183.46 more typical is uh you know these
2186.579 problems cause people to
2189.099 lose their confidence and and not you
2191.32 know uh pursue you know their profession
2193.96 as they may have done or
2197.02 um things of that nature so I I think
2199.96 it's all related to the fact that we our
2202.24 brains are very vulnerable and to get
2204.579 back to your question about the
2206.14 stimulant you know I think I think your
2207.94 brain was very vulnerable to it you know
2209.68 you you sort of may have had a
2211.06 predisposition to it
2212.74 um you mentioned that you have you're a
2214.839 little obsessive and with the tick there
2216.76 maybe you have this kind of you know on
2218.74 the on the mild side of the spectrum OCD
2221.619 um and I I probably do as well by the
2223.66 way so I also also have avoided drugs
2225.82 for that reason uh in my life I'll drink
2227.98 a little bit of wine here and there but
2229.359 that's about it
2231.28 um and uh but I I think most people
2234.339 don't avoid these things and we see
2236.32 these problems in relation to not just
2238.18 taking a stimulant but any kind of
2240.579 environmental exposure our own Society
2242.98 causes so much stress
2244.96 um and that's why I think we have these
2246.82 human conditions these are human
2248.14 conditions we try to model them in in
2250.72 animals but most animals don't have
2252.4 these kinds of problems you know I've
2254.5 heard that you can a an animal like a a
2257.56 monkey in the wild can have depression a
2260.44 monkey's version of depression but I
2262.54 don't think it's really typical or human
2264.339 depression you know and certainly it's
2266.02 not as prevalent as depression is in our
2267.7 human society I think you know we
2269.68 haven't evolved to manage the stresses
2271.66 that are in this society that we
2273.46 currently have and stimulants is
2275.14 probably one of them you know and I I
2276.76 suspect you are probably a little bit
2278.38 vulnerable
2279.94 um it's possible the stimulant led to an
2282.4 overdrive of your prefrontal and orbital
2284.14 frontal cortex and even brought out a
2285.94 little OCD Behavior related to this
2287.859 super uh this Superstition that you had
2289.96 so um no I believe that entirely and I
2292.72 also think you know that's why things
2294.579 like OCD and other kinds of psychiatric
2296.859 disorders tend to present themselves in
2298.359 college when people leave their home and
2301.42 they're in school and they're stressed
2303.82 and they're getting exposed to things
2305.5 that they haven't been exposed to before
2307.0 outside of the home and and you know
2310.18 their brains aren't evolved and
2313.2 sophisticated enough yet to help them
2315.64 cope with these kinds of stresses and
2317.38 how it manifests is in these kinds of
2319.119 conditions and it's I don't want to put
2321.16 a label on those conditions but
2322.359 certainly could be a psychiatric
2323.44 disorder but could also just be lots of
2325.119 anxiety it could also be the kind of
2327.88 problems that you had as well so um and
2330.7 I think the nucleus accumbens and the
2332.92 cortical areas that we've been
2333.88 discussing that that sort of send
2335.619 projections to these areas are are
2337.74 probably at least one of the main
2340.3 circuits involved in these kinds of
2341.619 things
2343.0 I'm relieved it's no longer present but
2345.4 I confess it oh I always feel it close
2347.74 by a long run helps so move you know
2350.859 being a slightly fatigued not overly
2352.96 fatigued but slightly fatigued seems to
2354.76 move out the the kind of physical
2355.78 compulsion but try to channel it um
2358.24 never taken any medication for it then
2360.28 here I am so I'm still still going I may
2362.56 call you for a referral at some point
2364.54 but sure at this point I'm uh I'm
2366.46 feeling okay
2367.9 um let's talk about nucleus accumbens
2369.88 and reward circuitry and the
2372.28 relationship between OCD reward
2375.339 addiction uh and to just give you a
2378.579 sense of where I'm headed with this is
2379.78 into the realm of a food related and
2382.48 eating related uh
2384.22 behaviors and disorders because I know
2386.32 you're doing some very important work
2388.599 there what is nucleus accumbens I know
2391.48 we all have one or two
2394.119 um one on each side of the brain what is
2395.92 it what roles does it play
2398.2 um in healthy brain behavior and in
2400.359 pathology
2401.56 yeah the nucleus accumbens is a part of
2405.22 the brain part of our reward circuits
2407.38 The Hub of the reward circuits that I've
2410.38 always been most fascinated in
2412.72 um
2413.38 there are scientists around the world
2415.48 some of the leading arguably some of the
2417.94 leading scientists in the world the
2419.5 father of addiction Neuroscience I call
2421.06 him
2421.9 um although he tells me I'm nuts Rob
2423.76 malenka who has studied the nucleus
2425.38 accumbens since the beginning of his
2426.76 career and who I worked with when I was
2428.68 at Stanford
2430.0 um fabulous scientist and Mentor taught
2432.4 me so much
2433.48 um taught the world so much incredible
2435.46 person scientist and phys and Physicians
2438.64 yes MD PhD and uh brilliant in both ways
2442.24 and um very
2444.82 fatherly in a lot of way in terms of
2446.5 teaching people how to how to do science
2448.359 and and be good citizens as well
2451.24 um
2452.079 but uh
2454.48 the nucleus accumbens is an area that is
2457.54 also very complicated because it has a
2460.48 lot of functions uh
2462.28 it it interconnects with many parts of
2464.859 the brain
2465.88 um
2467.079 but there are some things about the
2468.46 nucleus accumbens that are very
2469.72 consistent uh
2472.24 so when I started getting interested in
2475.06 reward and what a what I could do as a
2477.88 surgeon to try to improve how we manage
2481.54 Rewards and what I mean by that
2483.76 specifically is if you have an urge for
2486.7 a reward
2487.839 that that's a normal phenomenon that's
2490.119 not something we're trying to stop the
2492.099 issue is if you have an urge for a
2494.079 reward that either puts you or somebody
2495.82 else at risk it's probably a reward we
2498.22 shouldn't have I suppose you could say
2500.2 well it depends on the size of the
2501.28 reward and the size of the risk and how
2502.96 that fits into your societal Norms
2505.96 um but for example if you're obese and
2509.82 you have a doctor who is advising that
2512.98 you lose weight and try to control your
2515.02 eating habits uh you know perhaps better
2519.16 food choices is an important way for you
2521.079 to be healthier and and not pursuing
2523.18 those better food choices that's an urge
2525.16 that we probably need to treat
2527.56 uh if you're a drug addict and you use
2531.82 heroin or opiate considering the opiate
2534.76 crisis right now or cocaine
2538.56 which is untreatable at the moment uh
2541.96 you know that that cocaine might make
2544.78 you feel
2546.16 like you have some more energy that day
2548.26 to deal with your work or that opiate
2550.359 might make you feel better because life
2551.8 is stressful but the risk of doing those
2554.32 things is really high in fact
2556.359 potentially lethal uh so that's an urge
2560.32 that's treatable if you have OCD and you
2565.72 can't sleep at night because you're so
2567.579 nervous that you didn't lock the door
2568.78 and you've checked 30 times
2570.72 that's a reality for some people with
2573.099 severe OCD
2574.66 um that's an urge we got to treat
2576.88 eating disorder is the same eating
2579.22 eating disorders and obesity are
2580.9 obviously linked because of the
2582.94 relationship of a patient with food but
2585.04 they're also quite distinct not
2586.42 everybody with obesity has an eating
2588.04 disorder and obviously not everybody
2589.66 with an eating disorder has obesity I'm
2592.96 particularly interested in patients that
2594.7 have binge eating disorder as well as
2596.68 obesity because they're so heavily
2598.18 linked
2599.38 but not everybody with binging disorder
2601.54 has obesity but on average most are
2603.88 overweight
2604.9 um we are doing a deep brain stimulation
2607.48 trial at Penn where we're trying to
2609.4 modulate the nucleus accumbens and
2611.44 understand it better in patients that
2612.88 have failed gastric bypass surgery the
2614.8 most aggressive form of treatment for
2617.74 obesity and we and we believe they
2620.5 failed gastric bypass surgery because of
2622.48 binge eating disorder meaning they just
2624.46 can't control how much they eat so their
2625.96 obesity is either related or even due to
2628.54 overeating not some predisposition to
2632.859 um that body habitus you know obesity is
2635.44 a phenotype something that we can see
2636.88 not everybody is obese because of the
2638.8 same thing so it's very important I was
2640.48 taught this by a close mentor and friend
2642.579 Tom wadden when he was the director of
2644.68 the Obesity Center at Penn or the center
2648.04 for weight eating disorders
2649.78 and and he said to me you know Casey uh
2652.42 you know be careful with obesity you're
2654.52 interested in addiction and I understand
2656.26 you're interested in the addictive
2658.119 Tendencies of certain patients with
2659.74 obesity uh
2662.14 uh and and their relationship with food
2664.66 but not everybody with obesity has that
2666.46 problem and and in fact it's it's
2668.14 probably present about 20 of patients
2670.06 with obesity
2671.68 but now taking a step back twenty
2673.119 percent of patients with obesity is
2674.38 still a massive problem of epidemic
2676.42 proportions and perhaps some of these
2678.88 patients have either some form of
2680.74 binging disorder or or I should say some
2683.14 degree of bingeing disorder uh or at
2685.24 least loss of control eating which is
2686.98 common to both
2688.48 um so that's a feature that I think
2691.24 eating disorder experts obesity experts
2693.94 neurosurgeons
2695.52 obesity
2697.5 obesity medicine experts would agree is
2700.48 common to eating disorders and obesity
2702.579 and I also believe would is common to
2704.92 addicts and perhaps patients with OCD is
2707.56 sort of a loss of control disorder
2710.98 um it's actually not a disorder known by
2713.319 like the DSM-5 some diagnostic manual
2715.9 but a feature I should say of these
2718.359 conditions that's common and that common
2720.94 denominator I believe can be
2723.88 restored or at least this problem can be
2726.28 ameliorated or improved upon by a better
2729.16 understanding and a tailored treatment
2732.16 to the nucleus accumbens specifically
2734.52 we've learned in mice that if you expose
2738.099 a mouse now this is just a model if you
2740.26 expose a mouse to high fat food not food
2743.2 that they would normally eat food that
2745.06 is like 60 fat high fat it's like butter
2749.44 um
2750.339 we've learned that if you expose them to
2751.96 food like that within two weeks their
2753.819 nucleus accumbens is not functioning
2755.619 like a mouse that was never exposed to
2757.42 that high fat food there's aspects of it
2759.52 that are hyperactive I could say and
2762.099 there's aspects of it that are
2763.18 hypoactive or decreased activity but
2766.06 either way it's it's not functioning
2767.92 properly and most likely that function
2769.96 is predisposing continued behavior and
2773.14 then probably eventually leads to things
2774.76 like a habit that gets developed and
2777.099 that's a whole nother area of these
2778.839 kinds of problems that is very
2780.46 complicated and poorly understood but in
2783.4 any case if we just focus on the
2784.66 behavior at hand
2786.819 it seems that repeated exposure to
2789.46 something like high fat food
2791.319 a drug of abuse or any type of reward
2794.099 that is a really strong reward in a way
2798.64 it can hijack normal functioning of the
2800.92 nucleus accumbens so the goal of our
2803.28 invasive trial is to try to restore
2805.78 normal functioning to that nucleus
2807.46 accumbens uh in mice there seems to be a
2810.4 signal that predicts when they're going
2813.16 to lose control and we can use that
2815.38 signal to deliver a sort of a real-time
2818.26 therapy in the form of deep brain
2819.819 stimulation just a brief amount of
2821.2 stimulation and that actually blocks the
2823.24 behavior
2824.319 and what's interesting is over time that
2825.94 signal actually decreases in frequency
2828.3 which suggests some level of restoring
2831.46 normal function to that circuit in the
2833.5 mouse and we're trying to do that now in
2835.119 a human trial
2836.44 fascinating where is the stimulation
2838.72 provided because I would imagine if one
2840.94 were to stimulate nucleus accumbens you
2842.92 would see a reinforcement
2846.64 of whatever Behavior coincided or
2849.099 preceded the stimulation so the
2851.2 stimulation it's a a brief delivery of
2854.44 stimulation anywhere between 5 and 10
2856.42 seconds
2857.2 that is intended to just disrupt the
2861.579 perturbed signaling that's happening in
2863.319 the nucleus accumbens
2865.06 there are disorders like
2867.339 depression let's say that I I would
2869.859 describe as a bit more of a state
2871.24 disorder and this is obviously
2873.819 oversimplified because we know that
2875.8 there's fluctuations in mood and
2877.119 depression as well so don't let me
2879.099 oversimplify it too much
2880.9 um but
2882.579 um but but for now let's forgive the
2884.44 oversimplification if we if we accept
2885.94 that depression is a state disorder or
2887.859 maybe Parkinson's disease is a state
2889.42 disorder recognizing that they do
2891.22 fluctuate
2892.3 uh these types of problems most likely
2895.48 not but not definitely most likely need
2898.06 a continuous therapy of some form a
2900.46 therapy that's consistent uh perhaps a
2903.099 therapy that fluctuates with the
2904.359 condition but nevertheless still
2905.8 consistent
2907.599 um
2909.16 binge eating disorder or OCD or
2913.06 addiction
2914.68 um and binging disorder in the context
2916.78 of obesity a lot of these patients are
2919.0 functioning quite normally every single
2920.5 day it's just that intermittently
2922.359 throughout the day there's brief
2923.8 interruptions in their normal functions
2925.839 such that they have thoughts about food
2927.339 or the drug of abuse that they're really
2929.56 longing to have
2930.76 and so we want to deliver a episodic
2934.24 therapy delivered
2935.8 at the right time and only at the right
2938.14 time
2939.16 to try to interrupt the
2943.18 circuit aberration or the the problem at
2946.18 hand that is going to lead to that
2947.859 dangerous behavior and to kind of get
2949.66 the patient back on track to what
2951.16 they're doing
2952.359 um
2953.5 I don't necessarily think that it leads
2955.78 to a reinforcement it's possible we have
2960.04 to study that more but rather the goal
2962.98 is to just disrupt perhaps what is kind
2966.52 of Habitual
2967.96 um or or at least this kind of recurring
2971.8 problem that is happening you know
2973.24 people that have bingeing disorder at
2975.04 least at a severe level they tend to
2976.359  about once a day
2977.92 but they don't binge all day long of
2979.48 course they have a moment perhaps when
2981.64 they get home from work and they're
2982.9 stressed where they might
2985.599 have a bout of binge what constitutes a
2989.26 binge and I also want to know does binge
2992.68 eating disorder come on suddenly meaning
2995.5 as an entire disorder one day
2998.92 people wake up Suddenly they have
3000.3 binging disorder or is this you know a
3002.22 few too many buffets and I'm being
3004.38 entirely serious here you know kind of
3006.3 unlimited food and a circuit gets
3009.78 flipped or kind of starts moving into
3011.46 the high RPMs so to speak
3014.64 um so how does it come on and um I mean
3017.64 I'm actually surprised to hear that it's
3019.619 once a day I would think just hearing
3021.72 binging disorder I assume it's like OCD
3023.76 which it probably fluctuates across the
3025.8 day as well but I would have thought
3028.02 anytime people around food they just
3029.46 simply can't control their intake of
3030.72 food yes so so what does this look like
3032.819 in terms of the onset of the disorder
3034.92 and then what do you think underlies
3037.38 this once a day type of phenomena that's
3039.359 pretty interesting yeah so severe
3041.64 binging disorder these patients will
3044.579 binge about once a day it could be a
3046.02 couple times a day but in general it's
3047.46 not more than that moderate is about
3049.14 three to four times a week for example
3051.9 the reason I think that that seems
3054.96 surprising to you
3056.22 and
3057.42 if you think about it it is surprising
3059.88 but but
3061.14 um and I agree with you but the reason
3063.18 for that is is actually just in the
3064.619 definitions of the word
3066.24 and as a neurosurgeon in full disclosure
3068.88 as I as I mentioned you know I don't see
3070.5 these patients clinically I see them for
3073.02 research trial purposes and I try to
3075.119 understand the literature around eating
3077.64 disorders and I obviously collaborate
3079.559 with fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh in
3082.319 in these problems that are that are
3083.88 highly Innovative people
3085.38 uh but the word binge is a definition
3089.04 there's a definition to that word and
3091.8 you can't necessarily binge all day
3094.079 because our stomachs are not big enough
3097.14 um and so uh there's a limit to how much
3100.02 one can eat and to meet criteria for a
3102.24 binge you have to have a sense of loss
3104.4 of control
3105.42 you have to eat an enormous amount of
3107.339 food in a brief period of time
3109.8 and yes generally that doesn't happen
3112.2 more than about once a day in a patient
3114.599 with severe binge eating disorder uh
3117.3 however they can lose control quite
3120.18 often and in fact perhaps even at every
3122.339 meal they might meet criteria for about
3124.68 a loss of control where they yes they
3126.599 may have lost control but they might not
3127.92 have eaten enough
3129.359 to constitute what we would Define as a
3132.119 binge
3133.079 um and that would be a there's no
3135.359 specific number to that by the way it's
3137.099 it's really just compared to their
3138.599 normal meal you know perhaps it's uh 50
3141.96 of their daily calories in that one
3144.18 brief moment
3146.16 um so uh that's that's why I think it
3148.559 seems surprising that binders aren't
3150.24 happening more often than that what I
3152.76 would say is if we replace the term
3155.16 binge with loss of control eating loss
3157.44 of control eating Could Happen dozens of
3159.24 times a week
3160.5 um and in fact you know the patients
3162.0 that we're studying you know we've we've
3163.92 seen patients that lose control 20 30
3166.14 times a week and that's probably the the
3168.48 term you have in mind when you're saying
3170.22 you're surprised that it's just one time
3171.54 a day and it's specifically related to
3173.099 the fact that these patients have to eat
3174.72 such a large amount of food in such a
3176.64 brief period of time
3178.44 um so it's hard to do that more than
3179.579 once a day I see
3181.619 um you mentioned that some pre-existing
3184.859 anxiety might bias somebody to have a
3187.5 binge
3188.7 I'm also fascinated by something I've
3190.74 observed before which was when I was in
3192.78 college my my girlfriend had a roommate
3194.7 who we were aware was bulimic and would
3198.66 binge and then Purge and often uh when
3202.859 she ingested alcohol that would lead to
3205.02 a binge sure which is kind of the
3207.359 opposite of anxiety when I think about
3209.099 alcohol as something that slightly
3211.26 reduces prefrontal activity somewhat of
3213.599 a sedative or certainly a set of higher
3215.7 dosages
3216.66 so this brings to something that you
3219.78 said I'm just gonna I won't say it as
3222.24 eloquently as you did that it seems like
3224.04 it's not neither the case that anxiety
3226.74 leads to binging nor that hypo reduced
3230.099 activation of the forebrain and lower
3232.559 anxiety leads to binging it's this
3234.66 dysregulation of circuitry that the the
3237.3 Seesaw could go either way and it can
3239.339 throw things off it's off balance in
3241.44 both cases yes uh it's uh and that seems
3245.28 to be a that seems to pose a problem it
3248.4 seems like it's a particularly tricky
3250.2 problem and kind of explains to me in my
3253.319 non-clinical awareness why medication
3256.14 might be really hard to use as a way to
3258.72 treat this but that being able to poke
3260.28 around in the brain and assay in real
3262.2 time you know how do you feel do you
3263.94 feel like binging now or do you feel
3266.22 um further from the binge impulse
3269.22 is that what you do with these patients
3270.96 are they awake while you're stimulating
3272.4 the brain because it's one thing to say
3273.839 I stimulate a brain area and the binging
3275.46 goes away or partial relief or complete
3278.579 relief but how do you know are they in
3280.44 there with a donut
3282.18 um and you're tempting them so how do
3284.7 you actually know if it's ablating a
3286.859 brain area is going to lead to uh relief
3289.5 or exacerbation or no impact on on this
3293.04 disorder
3294.119 yeah so uh there's a lot to unpack there
3297.839 um I'll try to go one step at a time and
3299.7 if I miss something please remember no
3300.96 and I tend to ask these three-part
3302.579 questions specifically of neurosurgeons
3304.2 because I like to challenge you guys
3305.64 because again you are the astronauts of
3307.8 Neuroscience also I'm just going to take
3309.24 a moment to poke at neurosurgery because
3310.74 I have a couple close friends
3312.78 um who are neurosurgeons and I consider
3314.28 Casey Randy I don't know if he considers
3315.66 me a friend but of course I am a friend
3317.4 I'm teasing there too which is first of
3319.38 all they all have incredible hands right
3321.66 they have I'm not they all guard their
3323.94 hands with the kind of
3326.22 um uh protection that you would guard
3328.98 the the tools of the most important
3331.079 tools of your trade so they're very
3332.28 careful with their hands you're not
3333.48 going to see them doing heavy deadlifts
3334.98 you're not because of the way that
3336.839 impacts the motor neurons it's all about
3339.599 fine control yes um so if your
3341.339 neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts you
3343.14 might want to consider getting a
3344.28 different neurosurgery I hope I didn't
3346.2 put anyone out of work there and then
3347.76 the other the other thing is that
3349.8 um
3350.64 you all are tend to be very calm people
3353.7 at least on the exterior we'll return to
3355.8 this later okay
3357.119 um but I do throw three or four
3358.8 questions out at once so so elevated
3361.68 autonomic arousal and alertness as well
3363.96 as decrease autonomic arousal and
3365.52 alertness both seem to be able to lead
3367.02 to binging and then there's this
3368.52 question of how do you know whether or
3370.44 not to stimulate or to ablate or whether
3373.319 or not to leave a structure alone in
3374.88 other words what does one of these
3375.78 experiments look like in the laboratory
3377.22 yeah sort of a clinic excuse me yeah of
3379.8 course yeah these are questions I think
3382.5 about all the time
3383.94 um and um
3386.359 I do want to come back to the
3388.14 deadlifting comment but I
3391.559 um
3392.339 regarding and you and you referred to
3394.74 this earlier as well and I don't know if
3396.3 I've addressed it sufficiently either is
3398.339 is sort of like what what comes first
3399.839 here or how does this develop
3401.819 um
3402.54 I I think first of all I
3406.14 I like to understand these kinds of
3407.88 problems in in sort of the the construct
3410.76 of what I I consider to be a bit of a
3413.4 two-hit hypothesis
3415.619 um so you sort of need like in the
3416.88 concussion literature you need the
3418.5 second hit is can be devastating so if
3420.24 you have a concussion you know you want
3421.74 to only return to play when your
3423.48 symptoms are gone uh and cleared by a
3425.4 physician
3426.599 um
3427.74 so uh in the context of Eating Disorders
3430.68 or let's say binge eating disorder first
3432.359 of all I I didn't mention earlier but
3433.74 this is the most common eating disorder
3435.3 affects anywhere between three and five
3436.74 percent of the population wow
3439.02 um and it's probably
3441.02 under-diagnosed in obesity by the way
3443.04 and if obesity affects 35 of our
3445.079 population most likely binging disorder
3447.24 affects more than three to five percent
3448.619 but that's that's the current uh
3450.839 literature uh estimate on on the
3453.119 prevalence
3454.559 so um how do we develop a gene disorder
3457.26 and is it related to this anxiety
3458.7 question
3459.9 um
3461.04 you know I think that there is a
3462.78 predisposition that's the first hit
3464.94 um
3466.02 I actually think all humans have this
3467.52 predisposition just some have it more
3468.839 than others
3469.8 um I don't think that we've evolved to
3471.599 live in a society where
3473.7 foods are so readily available and
3475.74 enormously delicious and have so much
3477.96 sugar and fat in them not that there's
3479.88 any particular problem with either of
3481.8 these macronutrients it's just the
3484.079 excess of it and how they're refined uh
3486.96 that I think is the problem
3489.54 um
3490.14 you know those high fructose corn syrup
3491.7 in almost everything we eat we it's in
3493.619 bread I don't even know why it's in
3494.94 bread sometimes it's just kind of crazy
3496.98 so so I don't I don't think we're
3499.14 evolved to live in a society
3502.26 um
3503.04 that that has food that's so readily
3505.02 available like that
3506.339 um and cheap by the way in fact the
3507.96 cheaper the foods are sort of the the
3510.119 more refined and palatable and I would
3513.48 argue dangerous to eat I think they
3514.859 change our reward circuits for the worse
3517.859 um and put us at risk for wanting more
3520.319 um
3521.099 I tend to get a headache when I eat food
3522.9 like that and and perhaps that's uh
3525.78 evolutionary Advantage because I don't
3527.7 want to eat those Foods because they
3528.78 actually do make me sick
3530.579 um
3531.18 so um in a lot of ways I kind of wish
3533.64 that headache on everybody because
3534.96 perhaps we wouldn't have all these
3536.46 problems uh or at least some of them
3537.96 would go away
3539.04 so I think that's the first issue is a
3541.44 predisposition to
3543.839 uh or a vulnerability to these types of
3547.2 foods
3548.88 um which we undoubtedly all have to a
3551.46 certain extent but some more than others
3552.9 and then and then and that's so that's
3554.7 the first hit
3556.02 is this predisposition in the context of
3558.42 this sort of food focused Society
3561.24 and then the second hit is
3564.299 probably a stressful event or a
3567.18 stressful life
3569.099 um and probably a recurring stressful
3571.2 event I'm not sure this is published
3572.88 I've never sat down with like a eating
3575.16 disorder expert and and had this
3576.78 question about how this develops and I'm
3578.7 not sure it's actually well well known
3581.099 um
3582.119 but in a lot of ways I think that that
3584.16 answer anybody would agree with that we
3587.04 need sort of a predisposition in the
3588.599 exposure the environmental exposure and
3590.28 the genetic predisposition
3592.799 um
3593.579 but also a stressor and that stressor is
3596.7 probably one that's recurring and you
3599.22 know it's obvious in our society these
3600.72 stressors are everywhere and how we can
3602.4 manage them is is often poor and you
3605.52 know I think we can all relate with that
3606.9 and then there's something else in the
3608.579 background that I think is really
3609.96 important to mention is that patients
3611.579 with these kinds of problems are
3613.079 embarrassed because our society doesn't
3616.5 think fondly of these kinds of patients
3619.14 you know binging disorder patients they
3621.059 do tend to be overweight that's
3622.799 obviously a stigma obese obesity is
3626.22 another stigma then there's the opposite
3629.28 in a way it's an opposite by the way for
3631.02 a phenotype standpoint is that anorexia
3633.119 I mean that's another stigma and you
3636.96 know gosh you know
3639.24 not to make this about one sex over
3641.28 another but when when girls are told
3644.579 they're pretty because they're thin it
3646.68 just reinforces this problem and of
3649.38 course you want to complement people and
3651.359 make them feel good about themselves but
3653.16 the problem is that in this vulnerable
3655.68 society that that can lead to problems
3657.66 because people start thinking oh I
3659.4 should be thin or thinner
3661.98 um so I
3663.72 I think that it's a little bit of a
3666.0 societal understanding that our brains
3668.46 are very vulnerable and I think that
3670.02 will really help changing Society is
3672.18 hard and most of society is not you know
3675.48 ill meaning uh it's all done by accident
3678.599 um but that is the society that we live
3680.22 in so if we can try to improve that
3683.64 stigma uh and and be kinder to people in
3687.359 that way I think a lot of these problems
3689.099 would get better people that are obese
3691.44 that feel embarrassed by their obesity
3693.24 it doesn't help it only makes it worse
3695.76 because they give up
3697.38 same thing might be true for anorexics
3699.42 so I really think it's important to
3702.599 consider all of these things and that's
3704.22 why it's so complicated and it would be
3706.26 so hard to do a well-controlled study to
3708.18 understand it better because there's so
3709.619 many of these variables to control for
3711.24 that you really can't control for you
3713.339 might be able to control for them in a
3714.48 mouse's home cage but not not in the
3717.18 society that we live in so
3719.16 so that that's kind of my brief uh sort
3722.579 of summary of how I would answer your
3724.799 first question then I think you know
3727.319 your second question I I sort of take
3729.0 that as well how do you
3730.68 study such a complicated problem in the
3733.859 operating room and and in the clinic
3735.54 because I mentioned the operating room
3737.88 because that's sort of the first step
3739.74 here first we want to we have uh just to
3742.74 clarify we have a nih-funded uh trial
3746.16 approved by the FDA for for research to
3749.22 do this first in human study
3751.44 um we've treated two patients we have
3753.9 four more to come at Penn in um
3756.78 and in this study uh it's something I've
3759.599 been working towards my entire career
3762.48 what we don't know is
3766.2 where in the nucleus accumbens
3769.079 will we identify
3771.78 cells or
3773.94 regions that seem to be uh
3778.319 involved in this sort of reward seeking
3781.98 Behavior I would call it a peditive it's
3784.859 kind of like appetite but the word
3786.78 repetitive is I think a a good word to
3789.299 use what part of the nucleus Cummins is
3791.22 repetitive is the whole thing repetitive
3793.02 probably not it's huge in my world it's
3795.0 huge as a neurosurgeon you know I Target
3797.16 parts of the brain that are three or
3798.48 four millimeters in size the nucleus
3800.46 accumbens is almost a centimeter in size
3802.14 wow I didn't realize it was that large
3804.119 yeah it sort of like reminds me of
3805.98 discussions around the amygdala everyone
3807.299 thinks amygdala fear but Miguel has got
3809.76 a lot of different sub-regions and
3811.92 stimulation of certain areas of the
3813.54 megdala makes people feel great that's
3815.04 right another stimulation of other
3816.599 errors makes them feel terribly afraid
3818.339 exactly and that shouldn't surprise us
3820.319 because you know when we treat patients
3822.119 with Parkinson's disease for Tremor you
3824.7 know if we're in one part of the
3825.66 subthalamic nucleus will help their
3827.04 Tremor if we're in another part of the
3828.599 subthalamic nucleus the neurologist is
3830.28 looking at me like why isn't this
3831.72 working and that shouldn't surprise us
3833.579 we already know that you know two or
3835.2 three millimeters deviation or two or
3837.96 three millimeters away from where we
3839.22 want to be and you might not have the
3840.24 result you want and that's probably also
3842.339 true for these more limbic structures
3844.079 like the amygdala and the nucleus
3845.52 accumbens uh so you know regarding the
3848.819 nucleus accumbens we Traverse some of
3851.579 the nucleus accumbens not all of it in
3853.5 order to place the electrode that we
3855.78 want to use to
3858.059 detect when Cravings are happening for
3860.22 example and to try to block the Cravings
3863.52 from leading to the behavior related to
3865.92 the the reward seeking which is the
3867.78 overeating in this case
3869.4 uh
3870.78 so what we decided to do in the
3873.66 operating room was
3875.28 to actually try to leverage a tool that
3878.64 we use all the time when we take care of
3880.079 patients with Parkinson's so with
3881.76 Parkinson's these a lot of these
3883.02 patients not all have Tremor and so when
3886.14 we place an electrode into this motor
3888.42 structure
3889.74 to try to improve their movement
3891.0 disorder we often can hear Trevor cells
3895.14 and they sound we convert their
3897.9 electrical signal to an audible signal
3899.46 so we can actually hear it
3901.319 um and it sounds kind of like the Tremor
3903.78 looks like the frequency of the signal
3905.579 is the same as the handshaking
3908.48 exactly and so the the patient with
3910.92 Parkinson's is is Trump trembling Yep
3913.619 they're awake and you're poking around
3916.04 in a in a dedicated careful way of
3919.319 course one poke at a time one poke at a
3921.119 time with a very fine wire a set of
3923.099 wires listening to the electrical
3925.079 activity until you
3927.299 you encounter some cells that are
3930.119 sending out electrical activity that's
3931.799 right at a similar frequency exactly and
3934.079 then you can stimulate them or quiet
3936.059 them and see if the Tremor goes away so
3937.92 we we are very confident that when we
3939.72 stimulate that area of in this case the
3942.54 subcollamic nucleus uh
3945.119 we will make that Tremor we will disrupt
3947.819 that Tremor circuit and that Tremor will
3950.16 dissolve and it does that's why
3952.02 Parkinson's is so beautiful and
3953.7 inspiring and uh from us retractable
3955.74 yeah exactly but what is the it makes us
3958.2 feel we understand the brain right at
3959.88 least in that limited way so what is the
3962.76 um analog to Tremor in terms of appetite
3966.299 and desire to binge craving
3968.339 so craving is a term that you know
3971.76 there's probably other terms we could
3973.02 use by the way but that that's the term
3974.579 we've chosen to use for a number of
3976.44 reasons one because people relate with
3978.299 that term people that have binge eating
3980.28 disorder or obesity they if you ask them
3983.16 if they crave the answer will often be
3984.72 yes
3985.68 um if you ask them if they lose control
3987.359 or binge they might not know what you
3989.64 mean or they might not actually feel out
3991.38 of control even when they are
3993.18 um so uh but the word craving is
3996.48 relatable and so we set out to see if we
4000.079 could identify craving cells
4002.72 um in a patient with OCD which is
4005.96 related in fact we target a very similar
4007.819 part of the brain
4009.579 we tried to identify
4012.68 cells related to obsessions and we
4015.38 believe we did do that it was a single
4017.059 case study uh where we tried to optimize
4019.579 where our electrode was placed so we had
4021.74 some proof of concept that we would be
4024.26 able to elicit a sort of
4025.88 disease-specific symptom in the
4027.799 operating room assuming the patient
4029.72 could tolerate being awake not everybody
4031.88 needs to be awake for this procedure but
4033.74 at least for these first and human
4034.88 trials where
4037.039 um we're trying we're trying to
4038.18 establish where in the brain we need to
4039.74 be uh I think this type of approach is
4041.839 really critical and you know
4045.079 by the way none of this has been
4046.64 published uh but I think it's so
4048.619 important for people to know this so I I
4051.079 am willing to share some aspects of what
4052.94 we're trying to do
4055.039 um but uh but that's that's really the
4057.92 first goal of this trial is to identify
4061.24 where the nucleus accumbens we can
4063.5 detect these craving cells so we have to
4065.24 provoke food craving in the operating
4066.98 room that's the first thing how do you
4068.599 do that ah well um there are some uh
4072.44 somewhat validated ways to do that so
4075.799 for example we asked patients to provide
4078.559 pictures of food that they rate very
4080.9 highly as something that they would
4082.339 typically crave and you know depending
4084.68 on the patient it might be something
4086.359 that's very salty it could be very sweet
4088.099 like a donut
4089.96 um oh that's very good I love donuts
4091.88 right Donuts are great you should you
4093.38 should try the Cronut when you're here
4094.52 in New York City I just might I try not
4096.98 to eat that sort of thing for all the
4098.6 reasons
4100.6 just try to stop yourself after that one
4102.799 so if I were one of these patients given
4104.66 the fact that uh the binges come on
4107.839 pretty seldom once a day do you you I
4111.02 imagine you have them come to the the
4112.759 operating room fasted or semi-fasted
4115.279 they're faster okay they're fasted which
4117.08 probably they're probably surgical
4118.339 reasons for wanting that too they kind
4120.38 of have to be right and then you they've
4123.14 you've done the craniotomy removed a
4124.88 patch of skull yes you've lowered the
4126.44 wire into the nucleus accumbens and then
4129.08 they are viewing pictures of food that
4131.48 they crave and thinking of about it do
4133.16 they have olfactory cues smells of
4135.5 cronuts yeah I would love to do the
4137.0 olfactory because we haven't implemented
4138.319 that but that is a great uh thank you
4140.6 for and I'll give you full credit when
4141.859 we do review the grant but it sounds I'm
4144.44 so glad this work is funded because I
4146.06 mean this is what I I'll make this time
4148.64 it's not a joke when I refer to you all
4150.859 uh you neurosurgeons uh as the
4154.94 astronauts of the brain you know this is
4156.799 out on the
4158.66 extreme edge of what we don't know about
4162.199 how the brain functions and this is so
4164.48 far and away different than giving a
4166.04 mouse access to a high high fat food not
4168.56 that I'm not being disparaging in the
4170.12 mouse work but so the person says
4173.42 well I'm the patient in this case so I
4175.1 might say you know I'm hungry a donut
4176.839 sounds really good right now but craving
4179.96 to me is like I you know I'll cross the
4183.14 street cross town be late for my meeting
4185.719 eat three of these yes maybe even hide
4189.44 that from somebody that cares about me
4191.66 that doesn't want me doing this this
4193.1 kind of thing hide it from myself yes
4194.98 these kinds of behaviors I'm projecting
4197.3 and I'm fortunate that
4198.8 um I I have cravings for things in life
4201.199 but uh Donuts are not among the more
4203.48 extreme of them so
4205.04 um so this is all happening in real time
4206.78 and you're listening to the cells the
4209.12 same way you would listen to it and
4210.62 search for Tremor cells exactly same
4212.42 exact tools and you're doing that by
4214.94 um recording from a small population of
4217.34 cells in the area yeah in fact we do get
4220.04 multi-unit activity which is multiple
4222.08 cells uh but we really try to find one a
4225.02 single unit to listen to one neuron yeah
4228.02 because it's just um much easier to
4230.179 understand what that one neuron is doing
4232.219 versus trying to listen to and we also
4235.4 measure local field potential recordings
4237.32 but those are analyzed which is more of
4239.36 a population response thousands of cells
4241.58 kind of a porous of cells exactly
4244.46 um that we measure offline
4246.679 um the device that we use to
4250.04 um
4250.94 sort of treat these patients or
4252.44 intervene uh that we're studying it
4255.5 can't do single unit recordings it's
4257.3 only doing these more population
4258.44 responses so we correlate what we see in
4261.26 the operating room at the single unit
4262.76 level to the population response but we
4264.92 do that all offline
4266.84 um I can explain that in a moment uh
4270.38 but yes so we we try to identify these
4273.26 craving cells and uh because this is a
4277.04 feasibility study
4279.02 um and we can't
4280.699 you know be in the operating I'm
4282.08 searching for hours and hours and hours
4283.82 we do have some sort of we have
4285.8 guidelines that we've set for ourselves
4287.659 that we've uh developed with the NIH or
4290.96 the FDA to make sure that what we're
4293.36 doing is feasible and safe as well
4295.94 um so we we will spend a limited time
4298.04 trying to identify these uh craving
4300.08 cells but another
4301.64 uh sort of um strategy that we think is
4304.82 really important is
4307.159 um the effect of the stimulation so a
4309.5 lot of patients and this gets to sort of
4311.179 your question earlier about what kind of
4312.739 what comes first
4314.48 um you know a lot of people when they
4317.3 when they binge or they lose control
4319.52 over food
4321.56 um or seek drugs that moment of
4324.32 vulnerability is preceded by
4327.98 what we call a a moment of sort of
4330.38 pre-meal negative effect which basically
4332.84 means right before they binge they're
4335.36 feeling down or they feel stressed or
4337.52 anxious
4338.42 and they compensate for that momentary
4342.699 symptom by binging or losing control
4346.4 over food not everybody needs criteria
4348.56 for a binge so I try to specify that we
4351.38 are we are looking at loss of control
4352.58 eating specifically just because the
4354.44 Criterion of a binge is not as critical
4357.14 for us
4358.4 um
4359.36 so um so what we want to be able to do
4362.06 is trigger stimulation when this craving
4365.179 is detected by the device uh
4368.3 but we trigger it only when the craving
4371.0 is there and we believe that if we can
4374.48 sort of
4375.62 temporarily Elevate their mood ever so
4378.32 briefly again this is about five to ten
4379.94 seconds of stimulation only that perhaps
4382.34 that elevation in mood could actually
4384.679 sort of
4386.06 disrupt the
4388.28 craving to binge cycle
4390.92 maybe that's a habit maybe it's not but
4393.26 if you crave and then you binge if we
4395.6 can interrupt that with this moment of
4398.06 feeling good
4399.86 that might be a really good therapy for
4401.6 a patient and in fact
4404.48 when we do deep brain stimulation for
4406.219 obsessive-compulsive disorder we can
4408.86 fairly reliably induce a positive affect
4412.4 the problem is that it's not sustained
4414.8 and the reason it's likely not sustained
4417.26 is because with obsessive-compulsive
4419.0 disorder we treat that condition with
4422.0 continuous stimulation
4423.86 and it's not surprising that over time
4426.08 the effect kind of goes away so when
4428.179 they're in the clinic and we turn the
4429.32 device on our patients feel great and we
4431.659 feel like we've solved the problem
4434.179 but they call us the next day and
4435.8 they're like you know my my depression
4437.179 came back or my OCD hasn't gotten better
4439.94 and my moods back to where it was can
4442.4 you can you get it back to where it was
4443.6 yesterday because that felt great the
4445.34 brain loves homeostatic regulation it
4447.5 does and it does not like to shift
4449.54 patterns regression to the norm right
4452.0 um and I think there's sort of a
4453.02 tolerance effect there
4454.58 um that uh is is limiting the effect of
4458.54 continuous stimulation and actually in a
4460.4 mouse if you do continuous stimulation
4463.219 um the the sort of blockade of binge
4466.219 eating goes away so actually in a mouse
4468.32 we've actually demonstrated
4470.9 um we published this not too long ago in
4473.0 pnas that if you deliver stimulation
4476.02 intermittently and only when sort of a
4478.76 craving signal is detected so to speak
4481.94 um
4482.6 that that X that effect will be the most
4484.64 robust and durable
4486.38 um but if you deliver it continuously
4488.179 actually the benefit goes away over time
4489.92 so I've always encouraged my colleagues
4492.38 to consider more of an episodic
4494.54 stimulation approach rather than
4495.86 continuous deep brain stimulation but of
4497.54 course that that's for these more
4498.86 episodic conditions whereas these more
4501.26 quote unquote State disorders uh as I
4503.239 oversimplified earlier they might need
4504.86 more of a continuous therapy so that's
4506.54 definitely subject for a lot of research
4508.58 in the future
4509.9 um so in any case um the goal in the
4512.54 operating room was to identify a craving
4515.3 cell
4517.04 um deliver stimulation safely but also
4520.64 to capture a moment of elevated mood we
4523.46 were able uh to do that as we we are in
4526.219 our OCD patients as well
4528.14 and also to get an interoperative CAT
4530.96 scan we have devices now in the
4533.36 operating room that allow us to get
4534.679 Imaging in real time they're fabulous
4536.78 tools that we didn't have 10 years ago
4539.06 so we can confirm accuracy
4541.64 um you know where the you can see where
4543.5 the electrode is exactly precisely
4545.06 exactly
4546.14 um you know with 0.5 millimeters of air
4548.42 so super precise uh or as precise as we
4551.42 think we need to be
4552.8 um and we use connectomics so there's a
4556.82 tool in brain Imaging called
4559.48 tractography where we can actually
4562.58 measure circuit connections it's it's an
4564.92 indirect assay but we believe it's
4566.96 powerful it has its uh assumptions but
4571.34 um like anything in in science but we
4574.46 could actually
4575.5 map out where the nucleus accumbens
4578.42 connects to the prefrontal cortex sort
4581.9 of the cortical control inhibitory
4583.76 control pathway and where that pathway
4586.159 intersects with the nucleus accumbens
4587.719 and we can Target that area
4590.12 um structurally so those three goals of
4593.9 the surgery we we aim to set up to
4595.699 accomplish and we believed if we
4598.28 achieved two of those three that we
4600.32 would have a successful result in our in
4602.3 our early trial
4603.739 amazing
4605.54 given that at least to me the
4608.36 non-clination that anorexia is the
4611.3 mirror image of binge eating disorder
4614.36 and at least from what I learned one of
4618.199 the more deadly psychiatric conditions
4620.12 yeah um but also quite common yes
4624.02 um
4625.1 is it possible that nucleus accumbens
4627.5 this
4628.52 so-called reward circuit is also
4631.159 involved in anorexia but somehow it is
4634.1 the resistance to eating the craving of
4636.92 the fasted state or something like that
4639.32 that's being reinforced and and I asked
4641.659 this for two reasons one because I'm
4643.28 genuinely curious about anorexia of
4646.04 observed anorexia in a number of people
4647.48 that I know and it's a striking thing to
4650.6 see somebody just resist food despite
4653.6 all
4655.28 better knowledge of the fact that
4657.14 they're getting quite ill maybe even at
4659.48 risk of death but the other reason is
4661.88 that
4663.26 if in fact nucleus accumbens is the site
4667.58 which can Harbor cells to promote
4670.82 craving and craving of fasted States so
4675.199 to speak then that I think might tell us
4677.54 something fundamental about how the
4678.739 brain works which is that structures
4680.719 don't control functions per se
4682.46 structures control dynamics of
4685.04 interactions sort of like a
4687.52 Orchestra conductor has a certain number
4690.86 of operations that they perform but
4692.42 really their main function is to
4694.04 coordinate the actions of a lot of
4695.48 things not to make sure that the violins
4697.76 always play in a certain way alongside
4701.06 the oboes you can tell I'm not a
4702.38 musician here
4703.54 I actually have an appreciation for the
4705.56 openings yes those usually get left out
4707.0 what's that the obos yeah they usually
4708.5 get ignored my partner plays the elbows
4711.26 oh yeah so yeah I think it's a great
4713.659 analogy by the way
4714.98 um
4715.76 you know I I make this statement it's a
4718.159 little controversial but I actually
4719.48 think people would understand where it's
4721.4 where I'm coming from
4723.08 um across all of these sort of
4724.34 sub-specialties of medicine uh but I
4727.219 actually think especially with obesity
4729.26 remember it's a phenotype that's
4730.82 reflective uh often but not always of a
4733.28 behavior
4734.6 um but if you consider patients that
4736.28 have obesity and they they exhibit some
4739.1 sort of compulsion towards food so they
4741.02 they overeat despite the risk of it I
4743.6 think those kinds of patients are more
4745.699 similar to anorexics than they are
4747.199 different
4748.159 um anorexia and obesity are both
4750.02 phenotypes that are at least in this
4752.36 specific case of obesity and in anorexia
4754.48 a result of a compulsion to either over
4757.46 or under eat despite the risk these
4760.76 types of compulsions are driven by
4762.5 societal pressures
4764.32 brain vulnerabilities that are probably
4766.699 more similar than they are different
4769.219 they just happen to manifest differently
4772.12 why they manifest differently is
4774.199 probably related to each predisposition
4777.62 or perhaps preference that's hard to
4779.96 know like you I have a personal
4782.719 connection to these Eating Disorders
4784.52 anorexia included and uh yeah I think
4787.699 it's um
4788.84 it's very scary and it's a condition
4791.78 that
4794.02 often instills fear in psychiatrists
4797.96 because I think you know not not
4800.96 everybody by the way I mean I have some
4802.82 phenomenal psychiatrists that I work
4804.739 with both at Stanford and at Penn
4806.679 they're also involved in my obesity
4808.88 study that take care of these patients I
4810.38 mean these are heroes but there's a lot
4812.48 of psychiatrists that are not in this
4813.86 domain that find anorexia scared for the
4816.02 reason you said it has the highest
4817.52 mortality of all psychiatric conditions
4819.739 that includes depression because not
4822.62 only can these patients die of suicide
4824.12 but they die of metabolic complications
4825.739 of being underweight
4828.14 um so it's a uh it is it is a scary
4831.44 condition I I relate with that I am
4834.56 trying over time to bridge what I'm
4837.44 doing in obesity and binging disorder to
4839.48 atorexia for two reasons one because I
4841.82 think these problems are more similar
4843.38 than they are different and two because
4845.239 of the need
4846.32 um and I think we're well positioned to
4849.38 sort of tackle anorexia
4851.9 um using similar approaches not
4854.36 identical but but similar approaches um
4856.699 the nucleus accumbens has been studied
4858.739 in patients with anorexia in China
4861.26 actually my postdoc my first postdoc who
4864.44 I had the honor to train uh when I was
4866.6 at Stanford as a neurosurgeon in China
4868.34 when before he came to me actually was
4870.62 involved in a trial of anorexia that had
4872.659 some benefits
4873.86 um and uh there's studies in Europe
4878.719 um and elsewhere that have examined
4882.26 preliminarily uh the effects of deep
4884.3 brain stimulation targeting the nucleus
4885.98 accumbens uh for anorexia colleagues of
4889.159 mine in Canada Andres lozado is a
4892.159 wonderful neurosurgeon scientist has
4894.92 been studying the effects of going after
4896.48 Area 25 which is directly connected to
4899.239 the nucleus accumbens by
4901.46 um you know it's a monosynaptic
4903.08 connection so in a lot of ways you know
4905.179 perhaps delivering stimulation there
4907.1 could could be very similar to
4908.6 delivering stimulation with nucleus
4909.86 accumbens it's all part of one critical
4911.84 inhibitory control circuit he's seen
4914.12 benefits as well
4916.34 um
4917.239 so I I definitely think there's some
4919.159 evidence that this is an area that we
4920.84 need to be studying
4922.76 um I think our more episodic approach
4924.5 with response to stimulation going after
4926.36 sort of a signal in the nucleus
4928.159 accumbens that seems to be related to
4930.199 the compulsion to withhold from eating I
4933.5 think is what we will be trying to
4935.12 accomplish uh in our study it's a
4938.12 right now just being conceived though uh
4940.64 yeah these studies they move so slowly
4943.28 because you have to get a grant that
4945.38 Grant gets reviewed by the NIH six
4947.3 months after you submit it often gets
4949.58 rejected because it's too Innovative and
4952.219 too high risk so then you have to edit
4954.32 it and decrease the risk so it takes by
4957.26 obesity so it took two years to get
4958.76 funded
4959.78 and I worry about that time frame
4961.82 because that's a lot of time for
4963.32 patients with anorexia to suffer that I
4965.0 might be able to help at least in a
4966.56 small sample of patients so
4968.9 um but that that is the nature of how
4970.4 these things go you also have to get FDA
4971.9 approval to do these kinds of things we
4973.699 try to do all of this in parallel it's
4975.08 an enormous undertaking and in a lot of
4977.48 ways we're starting from scratch but in
4979.28 some ways we have some preliminary data
4980.96 to go after this so my hope is in about
4983.42 a year we'll have a similar trial for
4985.04 anorexia at Penn so so more to come on
4987.56 that
4988.34 um and and we're not the only lab that's
4990.8 trying to go after because of the the
4992.42 clear need so what is the status of
4995.48 non-invasive brain stimulation ablation
4998.12 and blocking activity in the brain I get
5000.88 a lot of questions about transcranial
5002.32 magnetic stimulation yeah I've actually
5004.12 had that done as a research subject sure
5006.46 when I was at Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab
5008.08 put a coil on my head I was tapping my
5010.12 finger in concert to a uh a drum beat
5012.82 and then all of a sudden uh because of
5015.4 the stimulation it was impossible for me
5017.02 to keep time yes with the drum beat
5019.36 that's cool cool it's a pretty wild
5021.719 experience to not have motor control and
5024.82 uh than to have motor control returned
5027.6 at the flip of a switch when someone
5030.1 else is controlling the switch it makes
5031.659 it especially Eerie
5033.58 um so my understanding is that
5035.38 transcranial magnetic stimulation is
5036.88 being used to treat depression and a
5038.38 number of other brain syndromes
5041.46 non-invasively so no no drilling through
5043.54 the skull the surgeons don't like that
5044.92 surgeons love to cut and drill with
5047.199 purpose but they do
5049.12 um but uh my understanding is that the
5052.719 spatial Precision isn't that great
5055.48 um ultrasound is something I hear a lot
5057.94 about these days
5059.62 um and my understanding is that
5060.94 ultrasound can allow researchers and
5063.219 clinicians to stimulate specific brain
5065.26 areas perhaps with more Precision
5067.54 um maybe you could just give us a
5068.8 coverage of what those are being used
5070.48 for what are your thoughts on on um uh
5074.86 these forms of non-invasive meaning no
5077.86 no flipping open of a piece of the skull
5079.659 type brain stimulation and blockade of
5083.5 brain activity sure yeah I wanted to
5085.9 clarify also these these surgeries
5087.699 generally don't
5089.32 um by the way require a full craniotomy
5092.08 it's usually just a small opening about
5093.52 the size of a dime in the bone so just
5095.44 just to clarify but that's painless too
5097.36 right uh well usually without pain yeah
5099.699 there's a little bit of scalp numbing we
5101.56 give a scalp block and the patients are
5103.54 getting IV sedations so they in general
5105.52 don't feel anything and if they do they
5107.56 tell me and we give them more local
5108.58 anesthetic but that's they're usually
5110.32 asleep during that part so it's
5112.0 minimally invasive but you know in a lot
5113.98 of ways there's no such thing as a
5115.239 minimally invasive procedure in the
5116.679 brain you know it's a it's kind of so
5118.54 glad to hear you say that oh no I you
5120.699 know I'm I'm not one of those
5122.02 neurosurgeons that you've probably
5123.58 encountered and we have mutual friends
5125.14 that uh and you know these mutual
5127.36 friends are some of my favorite people
5129.219 in neurosurgery and they probably
5130.54 actually think more like me than than
5132.04 not but there are neurosurgeons that
5134.38 you're absolutely right and this is true
5135.64 for all surgeries they really
5137.679 in a lot of ways they think what they do
5139.239 is sort of the ground truth or is it
5141.04 closer to the ground truth and I I get
5143.02 that
5143.98 um uh you know probing with purpose I I
5147.46 actually really like that I'm going to
5149.32 use that if you don't mind
5150.76 um just it's just describing what you do
5153.28 so yeah but I I actually have I've
5156.4 always said this I've said it publicly
5158.44 I've said it to my boss I've said this
5160.42 to my team
5162.159 um we need to embrace non-invasive
5163.719 approaches
5165.699 um
5166.48 some of them are a little fluffy
5168.88 um fluffy in that we don't understand
5170.5 how they work
5172.12 we don't necessarily understand how deep
5173.5 brains too much works by the way so
5176.08 um but because we don't know exactly how
5177.699 they work
5178.6 they're not as precise as we would like
5180.159 them to be so we have work to do there
5181.719 and I actually think that work is doable
5183.76 and actually underway
5186.52 um you know at Stanford we have great
5188.38 collaborators that that I think are
5190.06 doing this people like Nolan Williams
5191.56 and Connor Liston at Cornell and others
5195.34 um so we uh I think that
5198.28 TMS transcranial magnetic stimulation it
5201.52 is FDA approved for depression by the
5203.32 way it's also FDA approved for OCD and
5205.3 for nicotine addiction where do they put
5207.219 the coil for those three or more or less
5209.8 yeah so they put it over was always on
5212.02 the scalp and uh over the frontal lobe
5214.78 and there's different parts of the
5216.04 frontal lobe that have been demonstrated
5217.8 to be a little better or a little bit
5220.12 worse
5221.5 um but what the FDA has approved for
5223.96 depression I believe is uh similar to
5227.08 what's been approved for uh OCD but for
5229.42 addiction I believe it is a different
5231.04 Target but we'd have to ask our our TMS
5233.44 experts on that can they direct the
5235.0 transcranial magnetic stimulation deep
5236.8 below the cortex they try uh and we're
5239.56 we're actually studying this in OCD
5241.42 patients now
5242.739 um I as a part of our invasive trial uh
5246.58 where we are trying to pull patients
5248.26 from a TMS trial that's in parallel to
5250.54 what we're doing
5251.92 um all funded by the foundation for OCD
5254.139 research
5255.12 where we believe we can use TMs to to
5258.88 define a circuit that if modulated
5262.32 improves OCD albeit temporarily and in
5266.199 those patients if it's temporary they
5267.76 would be appropriate for an invasive
5269.26 study so something we're actively
5271.84 working on I've always believed that
5273.639 neurosurgeons need to be part of the
5275.86 discussion with these non-invasive
5277.42 approaches we don't need to do them but
5280.12 I think we can help make them more
5283.239 precise and to probe non-invasively with
5286.659 purpose
5287.82 rather than this more kind of
5292.48 I don't know a non-invasive blast effect
5294.639 kind of you know
5296.92 I I just can't imagine how that is going
5298.96 to be as effective as probing with
5301.42 purpose but you can do that not
5302.44 invasively as well and I think we need
5304.179 to do better uh in that way I do believe
5306.639 that's possible and I think people are
5307.84 actively trying to do it
5309.639 um getting deep in the brain with TMS I
5311.62 think will always be hard but you can
5313.48 get there indirectly by using
5315.219 connectivity assays and targeting
5317.4 superficial structures that have
5320.199 High connectivity to deep structures so
5323.98 for example
5325.3 um perhaps one day there will be a TMS
5327.28 Target for anorexia and obesity
5330.84 if we are scratching the surface with
5333.76 invasive approaches to these problems
5336.28 we we're even doing less with the brain
5338.92 stimulation
5340.0 um so we have so much work to do there
5341.62 eating disorders and TMS have been so
5345.76 um sort of scarcely studied or or there
5349.3 have been so such little research done
5350.8 in that in that space and so it is an
5353.26 area that we need to to work on
5355.36 um for the obvious reason for example in
5357.58 a patient with anorexia just thinking
5359.02 practically you know placing a device in
5361.36 a patient who is significantly
5362.98 underweight might not be the best
5364.84 approach you know wound erosion and
5366.88 issues like that could come up so
5368.739 developing a non-invasive approach I
5370.3 think is critical the problem is where
5373.0 do we target
5374.5 and so the only way to answer that I
5377.02 think reliably is to accept that we have
5379.48 to get into the Brain before we're out
5381.639 of the brain and with these kinds of
5383.32 conditions we're only just starting to
5384.88 get into the brain you know so I I worry
5386.92 that we're a long way away from a
5389.8 non-invasive approach that really works
5391.9 consistently
5393.76 um sorry to interrupt um I want to make
5396.699 sure we touch on ultrasound because yes
5398.679 um but um his
5401.219 historically it seemed that there was a
5403.42 bit more permission for people to probe
5405.699 around in the human brain I I've um
5407.86 sometimes refer the podcast to some of
5410.679 these papers that were done uh allowing
5413.98 patients to self-stimulate in the brain
5415.9 these are work done in the in the 60s
5418.48 and now his name Escapes Me Robert
5420.82 um anyway there's a couple papers
5422.199 published in science allowing patients
5424.06 to stimulate a couple different brain
5425.32 areas asking which ones they preferred
5426.94 and I was always shocked and slightly
5429.06 intrigued by the fact that the the brain
5431.62 area that all three of these patients
5433.179 who I don't think had any syndromes I
5435.1 think they volunteered for these
5436.3 experiments I don't think you could do
5437.98 this anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah
5441.1 I think uh was not the same as it is now
5443.139 things have changed
5444.639 um fortunately but they
5446.86 um all three of them seem to like some
5449.56 midline thalamic structure which for
5451.3 those listening it's just area kind of
5452.56 in the in the dead center of the brain
5455.139 um more or less that evoked a sense of
5458.26 kind of frustration and anger which
5460.0 surprised me because I would have
5461.08 thought oh it's Robert Heath his
5463.3 experiments rather than patients
5464.86 preferring to stimulate areas that evoke
5466.54 laughter or Joy or a feeling of
5468.219 drunkenness or Delight it also explains
5471.88 a lot of what I observe in social media
5473.5 this sort of um kind of people
5475.06 repeatedly engaging in battles
5477.88 um that are kind of trivial it seems
5479.5 like frustration and anger might have
5481.0 its own reward circuitry anyway I don't
5483.82 want to go too far down that rabbit hole
5485.26 but it
5487.0 um it's a deep one it's a deep one and
5488.98 and kind of gets to our nature yeah you
5491.739 know as humans and what we find
5493.179 interesting or rewarding but you know
5496.54 the ability the inability to probe
5500.38 around the brain in a safe way without
5502.84 the need for somebody to be very sick
5505.84 would be I think would be enormously
5507.76 powerful and at least in my mind if I
5509.86 were in charge which I'm not
5511.719 um would offer the opportunity to really
5514.84 come to an understanding about how the
5516.28 human brain works without all these
5518.5 issues of how to translate from Mouse
5520.12 studies and again there's huge value to
5522.159 animal studies as we both agree but
5524.679 um so many of the things that we want to
5526.9 know about the human brain involve
5528.46 asking the person hey do you what do you
5530.679 feel when that set of neurons is
5532.42 stimulated and what don't you feel uh
5535.06 and a mouse we can ask and ask but
5537.1 they're not going to tell us something
5537.82 they do tell us they're not going to
5538.84 tell us in English so
5541.239 um how do we overcome this challenge but
5543.4 first
5544.179 ultrasound or if you prefer after
5546.04 ultrasound what is ultrasound going to
5548.32 be really useful towards solving these
5549.82 clinical issues and these basic issues
5551.44 yeah so I think
5553.0 um
5554.139 let's start with ultrasound then we'll
5555.76 come back to it um so ultrasound right
5558.1 now
5558.9 transcranial magnetic
5561.36 magnetic resonance guided Focus
5564.1 ultrasound so
5565.6 um uh this this is an FDA approved
5568.36 method
5570.04 to
5571.54 deliver an ablation to the brain
5573.58 non-invasively
5575.32 there are researchers myself included
5578.02 that are trying to use transcranial
5580.36 magnetic guided magnetic resonance
5582.04 guided Focus ultrasound or MRI guided
5584.199 Focus ultrasound
5585.6 to use it in a modulatory way not just
5588.4 as an ablation but to drive neuronal
5590.86 activity or inhibit it perhaps we're
5592.659 still learning how to do that
5594.46 um there are trials that are trying to
5596.98 understand if you can use ultrasound to
5598.54 open the blood-brain barrier so you can
5599.98 deliver a medication to that specific
5602.139 area uh perhaps for a brain tumor or
5605.38 something like that
5606.58 so um it's a very exciting field
5609.82 um and it is FDA approved for Tremor
5611.739 right now and so I actually do it
5613.9 routinely
5615.1 um
5615.76 for patients with Tremor with
5617.38 Parkinson's or a central Tremor and so
5620.5 um I I love doing it it's uh often just
5623.44 kind of a miracle because there's no
5625.179 incision I don't have to place an
5626.32 electrode into the brain to achieve a
5627.94 similar result how early into the
5630.78 pathology of Parkinson's can someone
5633.04 think about approaching this so for
5634.719 instance if somebody has a parent or a
5637.06 sibling and they're developing some
5638.38 resting Tremor yeah obviously they
5640.36 should talk to a neurologist but a
5642.1 neurosurgeon but this non-invasive
5644.38 approach could be incredible for them as
5647.08 opposed to just take only taking drugs
5649.84 to increase dopamine levels yeah so um
5652.239 depending on the reason you have Tremor
5653.98 would dictate the kind of medication you
5655.719 would use it could be Parkinson's but if
5657.219 it's not it might be a central Trevor by
5658.719 the way essential tremors 10 times as
5660.52 common as Parkinson's really essential
5662.62 tremor is the most common neurologic
5664.3 condition in patients over the age of
5666.04 70. we often aren't aware of that people
5669.82 with essential Trevor feel they have
5671.08 their forgotten disease because there's
5672.4 no Michael J fox for a central Tremor I
5675.219 sent a letter sorry is it essential
5677.44 tremor or or essential
5682.9 um
5683.92 I actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton
5685.96 I I've observed uh Tremor in him and I
5689.02 think he's actually disclosed that he
5690.28 has it and I hoped he'd become a
5692.44 champion for for patients with a central
5693.88 Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor does as
5696.46 well she's also public about it but I I
5698.5 was not able to get them eager to become
5700.719 the champion for this condition but like
5702.76 Michael J fox these patients need a
5704.62 champion like that
5706.179 um but unfortunately it's a bit of a
5708.219 forgotten disease nevertheless because
5711.04 of the FDA approval of focus ultrasound
5713.44 for Tremor
5715.179 um another's trying to get some
5716.92 attention for sure and uh it's
5719.08 fabulously effective for these patients
5720.58 it treats patients on one side usually
5722.199 their dominant hand or their worst hand
5723.76 and it um it really speaks to the fact
5727.0 that wow you can deliver non-invasively
5729.46 an ablation to the brain in a
5731.62 hypothesized zone that we think is
5733.9 related to the problem at hand and at
5736.42 least with Tremor it works really well
5738.159 could this be effective for psychiatric
5740.739 disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well
5745.36 um perhaps uh actually that would be the
5747.76 ideal the problem is we don't know where
5750.58 to do the ablation
5752.739 um there is a trial that we would like
5754.3 to do for OCD where we would deliver an
5756.58 ablation to the same area of the brain
5758.32 that we've been delivering ablations to
5759.88 for years for patients with OCD and it
5761.86 helps a bit that's called a capsulotomy
5764.56 um but really the outcome is probably
5766.12 going to be about the same it's a nice
5767.679 method because it's non-invasive but we
5770.86 need to find a new Target for these for
5772.659 these conditions and because of the
5774.4 common denominator of the urge despite
5777.88 the risk sort of that compulsion
5781.0 um yeah perhaps it could be the same
5782.32 Target I don't know
5783.94 um but I would argue we need to do these
5786.219 modulatory experiments either with a
5788.32 device or with uh invasive recordings uh
5791.739 to better understand where these
5793.36 problems are coming from to Define where
5795.76 we should do an ultrasound treatment so
5798.94 um you're right historically
5801.48 without much regulation we've we've
5804.4 probed the brain
5805.659 um
5806.26 the problem we can't learn a lot from
5809.38 those experiments now uh well in this
5811.96 way at least we don't know exactly where
5814.0 those electrodes were we didn't have MRI
5815.62 scanning or high quality cat scanning to
5818.139 to know where those electrodes were with
5819.76 certainty
5820.84 where and we know two or three
5822.58 millimeters matters and we also didn't
5824.38 have the tools to place electrodes in a
5826.96 precise way back then so unfortunately
5829.9 we can't learn a lot from those
5831.1 experiments right now
5832.659 so we're sort of redesigning them and
5835.179 there is a way to do it now
5836.98 um patients with epilepsy benefit from
5838.84 this all the time there has been a
5840.94 revolution in America it was in Europe
5843.04 before it was in America where we would
5844.84 do stereo encephalography which is
5847.239 basically like doing an EEG of patients
5850.12 with epilepsy but with invasive
5852.1 electrodes and we would Place tiny
5853.96 little wires less than a millimeter in
5855.52 diameter all throughout the brain into
5857.26 parts of the brain that we believe are
5858.76 involved in seizures and we would admit
5861.159 the patients to the hospital and figure
5863.08 out where the seizures were starting and
5864.699 propagating and then um you know we
5867.159 could stimulate these electrodes to see
5868.6 if there was a symptom that was
5869.739 important and I try to identify a region
5872.8 that we thought we could either remove
5874.84 surgically ablate with a laser or put a
5878.139 stimulator in it perhaps that's
5880.719 commonplace now for epilepsy
5883.0 um
5883.6 and it works extremely well and it's
5885.76 very safe of course it's still a brain
5887.38 procedure but the uh the complication
5890.62 rate is surprisingly low quite honestly
5893.199 for the amount of electors that we place
5895.96 um and it's extremely well tolerated
5897.58 most these patients leave the hospital
5898.78 and they don't even feel like they've
5899.86 had surgery
5901.12 so uh there's actually a lot of interest
5903.28 in using that procedure to study mental
5906.699 health disorders
5908.739 we are trying to do it for patients with
5910.78 obsessive compulsive disorder we're
5912.76 awaiting an FDA decision on that uh but
5915.34 actually I credit uh our colleagues at
5918.219 Baylor and at UCSF for for studying this
5921.52 uh already we have fabulous colleagues
5924.699 at UCSF that have studied depression
5927.159 using this type of approach a mutual
5929.86 friend of ours uh you know Eddie Chang
5932.679 who's a wonderful friend and colleague
5935.38 somebody I've emulated for many years as
5937.3 well uh and and the the Psychiatry team
5940.0 at UCSF have worked together on this
5941.86 sort of
5942.82 bringing together the epilepsy technique
5944.92 and the Psychiatry expertise to study
5947.38 how we could better Target electrodes in
5950.32 depression and I'll tell you if they
5952.42 have a consistent Target
5954.4 perhaps there becomes an ultrasound
5956.86 Target
5958.0 um but right now the approach is a bit
5960.28 more reversible because you can always
5962.02 shut that electrode off or even remove
5964.06 the electrode if perhaps it's not in the
5966.76 optimal location to treat the depression
5969.159 uh but actually after a large volume of
5972.159 cases perhaps they could pool that data
5975.699 to develop a a new ultrasound Target for
5979.179 depression I think that would be
5980.199 fabulous and probably is their long-term
5982.3 goal
5983.199 um not to speak for them but that would
5985.12 be something that I I'm sure is on their
5986.679 radar and a Baylor is trying to do the
5988.84 same thing for depression their
5991.36 approaches are a little bit different
5992.62 but a similar tool to try to understand
5994.42 uh depression and you know we're working
5996.76 with all these types of uh colleagues
5999.76 some of these are our friends to try to
6001.26 to bring this to OCD as well and you
6004.08 know it makes sense to try to do this
6005.58 for addiction and obesity and anorexia
6008.28 you might ask well why aren't you doing
6009.9 this for obesity right now in uh in our
6012.42 in our study and the reason is that
6014.58 um we've developed a target for obesity
6016.92 uh and binge eating disorder uh
6018.96 developed out of mice that we believe
6022.139 um is relevant for the human State
6023.699 because you can model this problem in a
6026.1 mouse a bit better than you can model
6027.78 depression or OCD so we feel like we can
6031.199 rely on the pre-clinical studies more
6033.44 whereas with these perhaps more I don't
6036.48 want to say more complicated but more
6038.1 human mental health conditions that are
6040.44 hard to model in a mouse you really have
6043.56 to study it in the human and you can
6046.02 perhaps start in an epileptic patient a
6047.82 patient that has electrodes and try to
6049.5 provoke a depressed state or study
6051.06 epileptics like Dr Chang has done that
6053.82 have comorbid depression for example and
6056.88 that can really validate this approach
6058.32 as well but in the end it's it's getting
6060.54 into the human brain that we need to do
6062.28 in the disease specifically that will
6066.3 eventually lead to a non invasive
6069.06 approach either a lesion or modulatory
6071.46 approach modulatory would be like TMS or
6073.5 lesion approach would be with ultrasound
6077.46 couldn't agree more
6079.28 meanwhile because there are many many
6082.44 millions of people suffering from
6084.06 depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's
6086.76 and essential tremor
6088.92 Etc
6090.78 well first of all I should say based on
6092.94 everything you've told me thus far it's
6095.219 amazing to me that any pharmacologic
6097.86 treatments work because of how systemic
6101.04 they are and impacting serotonin
6103.02 serotonergic neurons over here in
6104.639 dopaminergic neurons over there and not
6106.38 targeting any specific batch of cells it
6108.239 makes perfect sense as to why all the
6109.8 side effects exist
6111.119 but earlier you said something that
6112.86 really grabbed my attention I want to
6114.54 come back to which is that
6116.699 if people can be made to feel or make
6119.46 themselves feel just a little bit better
6121.679 a little less anxious just prior to a
6124.739 craving episode or a binge episode
6127.5 maybe even if people can become better
6129.78 at detecting their own internal States
6131.699 and when they're kind of veering toward
6133.98 a binge or veering toward using a drug
6136.26 or
6137.28 maybe even veering towards suicidal
6140.04 thinking
6141.3 I based on what you said earlier that
6144.239 those kind of um
6146.36 pre-behavioral States
6148.679 the kind of drift on the on the steering
6152.219 um
6153.3 those sound like powerful
6155.76 levels of awareness at least for now
6158.52 until we have specific sites in the
6160.92 brain that we can Target non-invasive
6162.3 methods that could be deployed to
6163.5 millions and millions of people seems
6165.3 like that awareness seems like maybe
6168.179 among the best tools that people could
6170.219 develop yes 100 agree with you you know
6172.679 so for the person with OCD or uh who
6175.44 suffers from anorexia or binge eating
6177.54 disorder and to their clinicians you
6179.219 know I I just want to highlight that you
6181.26 said that I mean I'm not again I'm not a
6183.179 clinician I always say this I don't
6184.44 prescribe anything I profess things
6187.08 um and uh but
6189.9 awareness of one's thinking seems
6192.6 immensely powerful in this context yeah
6195.42 um and after all it is the clinical
6198.42 probe that you use because the if let's
6201.84 say the patient were to lie to you about
6203.52 their experience of
6205.92 what happens in their mind when you
6207.78 stimulate you could basically the whole
6210.54 thing the whole surgery the whole
6212.159 procedure could go badly wrong so it's
6215.159 it's up to the patient to be of course
6217.139 honest with you in their their
6218.9 incentivized to do that but to be honest
6220.8 with themselves about ah you know I've
6223.679 gone all day without a binge but you
6226.92 know the the smell of a donut or the
6228.84 thought of a donut is starting to have a
6230.58 particular Allure that awareness seems
6232.8 like an incredibly powerful thing to own
6235.139 and to and to build and cultivate yes
6237.48 I've always thought that if we could
6239.219 improve awareness we can improve
6241.02 outcomes I think that's probably true
6243.06 for many of these patients the problem I
6245.52 think comes down to the fact that some
6247.26 of these patients are so resistant to
6249.42 treatment
6250.44 and the patients that we see as a
6252.719 surgeon for example are the patients
6255.0 that they've tried cognitive behavioral
6257.52 therapy certainly have tried medications
6259.32 they've tried Behavioral Management they
6261.96 are aware of their problem and they've
6264.239 shown that to us they can tell us when
6265.739 they're craving
6267.36 but despite the craving and despite
6269.1 being involved in this invasive brain
6271.08 surgical trial highly you know first in
6274.38 human novel study which I think will
6277.619 have a positive effect but it's still
6279.239 experimental uh they still can't stop
6281.88 themselves so there
6284.4 sort of as made aware as could possibly
6287.159 be did I use grammar there correctly I
6289.44 think so
6290.4 um they're as aware as they could
6292.739 possibly be and they still lose control
6295.219 we've had this studied in the lab so we
6298.199 will bring patients to the laboratory
6299.76 with this implanted device
6301.92 to to try to provoke this electrographic
6304.679 electrical signal that can be detected
6307.679 by the actual device that will stimulate
6309.96 them when they're at home
6311.76 but before we actually initiate
6313.199 stimulation we want us to see can this
6315.48 device detect this craving cell signal
6318.78 which is going to be different than what
6320.34 we saw in the operating room because
6321.3 that's a single cell but these devices
6323.34 these electrodes are about a millimeter
6324.84 in diameter instead of like a tenth of a
6326.82 millimeter which is what we use in the
6328.38 operating room
6330.119 um so they're they're only hearing or or
6332.639 detecting I should say thousands of
6334.92 cells responses and
6338.46 we actually have a way to provoke
6341.34 binges it's called a mood provocation
6343.38 it's very well well very well validated
6345.6 it's a little bit like provoking
6347.1 seizures in the epilepsy monitoring unit
6348.9 but here in these sort of uh psychiatric
6352.739 monitoring unit or the the food
6354.3 monitoring unit uh we we actually have a
6357.9 psychiatrist and eating disorder
6359.1 Specialists come and
6360.659 induce a mood that is related to
6364.98 each patient's sort of self-described
6367.98 binge episode so the psychiatrist comes
6370.739 in and provokes yes a feeling that can
6374.52 evoke the negative behavior that's
6377.699 exactly right so that we can video and
6380.1 synchronize the video to the brain
6382.44 signal recordings
6384.36 um the patients all wear an eye tracker
6385.92 so we can see what they're eating at all
6387.719 times and what they're looking at
6389.159 specifically and that allows us to have
6393.84 the best temporal resolution possible to
6396.719 understand what is happening right
6398.58 before the bite
6399.78 and even under video surveillance
6401.82 through a one day one-way mirror in a
6403.98 laboratory setting when patients are
6407.4 very well aware that their there to be
6410.46 studied if they're going to binge
6412.92 they still do and we believe they do
6415.739 because they just can't control it as
6417.84 aware as they are of it
6420.239 and it's probably because they're the
6421.679 most severe
6422.94 so I think if we can improve awareness
6425.639 not just the societal awareness that I
6427.44 was talking about earlier but the
6428.52 patient awareness around their problem I
6431.699 think that could be a powerful way to
6433.38 help so many of these patients and
6434.639 that's sort of the role of cognitive
6436.02 behavioral therapy
6437.94 um the problem with cognitive behavioral
6439.5 therapy or should say the limitation of
6440.94 it I actually don't have any problem
6442.32 with it I think it's a wonderful
6443.4 treatment
6444.9 um
6446.219 is that if you stop it many of these
6448.199 patients go back to their old behaviors
6450.54 I don't say old habits but it might be a
6452.58 habit but the old behaviors
6454.44 and so um
6456.36 that's the problem is it's not
6457.619 necessarily lasting in the absence of
6459.179 continued cognitive behavioral therapy
6460.679 some people can benefit from it long
6462.3 term but some can't uh
6465.06 but I think in in in the less severe
6467.34 patients improving awareness key but in
6470.52 these really refractory patients this is
6472.08 this is kind of like this is the disease
6473.84 despite the awareness they can't control
6475.98 themselves and that's what we're trying
6477.84 to restore is that improved ability to
6480.3 control their behavior
6481.739 do you think there's a role for machines
6483.719 and artificial intelligence here uh
6487.199 there are a couple Laboratories up at
6488.699 the University of Washington that are
6490.86 using
6492.48 particular signature patterns of within
6496.02 voice to try and help
6498.84 suicidal people who are suicidally
6501.54 depressed
6502.92 know when they're headed towards an
6504.54 episode before they even can consciously
6506.4 know so this gets right down issues of
6507.96 Free Will and whether or not machines
6509.1 can be smarter than we are but you know
6510.9 one could argue that some of the search
6512.159 algorithms on Google and other search
6514.679 engines are actually more aware of our
6516.84 preferences than we are
6518.88 um
6519.6 basically what these are these are
6521.34 devices that are listening to people
6522.659 talk all day they're also paying
6524.159 attention to patterns of breathing and
6525.719 how well people slept Etc integrating a
6527.82 huge number of cues and then signaling
6530.699 somebody with a you know a yellow light
6532.739 like you know you're headed into a
6534.6 depressive episode the person might say
6535.92 I feel fine or I feel pretty good this
6538.32 is kind of Baseline state for me and
6540.06 they say ah this is where you were
6543.36 preceding the last episode that took you
6545.52 down a deep dark trench and it took
6547.08 months to get out of
6548.94 um I wonder whether or not some of these
6550.44 devices could help with the sorts of
6553.02 things that we're talking about today
6554.159 yeah I think so
6556.5 um I've always said we have to get in
6558.719 the Brain before we get out of it and if
6560.639 we get in the brain and understand what
6562.38 these signals look like we'll know what
6564.48 those non-invasive signals are I think
6566.94 it's possible that we are
6570.199 scientifically sophisticated enough to
6573.96 use machine learning
6576.239 um and sort of this kind of botan
6578.4 technique to anticipate when somebody is
6581.58 going to be highly impulsive you know
6583.26 suicide it's the most dangerous impulse
6584.58 it's something that is
6587.48 immensely a focus of the lab is
6590.1 impulsivity we've talked mostly about
6591.659 compulsion compulsion being you know
6594.54 going after a reward or the urge despite
6597.6 the risk
6598.86 um impulsivity is is similar but
6601.26 different it's it's kind of going after
6602.639 something
6604.5 um a little bit if you if you model
6606.48 impulsivity in a mouse it's you know
6609.239 related to you know going after a food
6612.659 reward without the sort of paired tone
6616.08 that your the mouse is supposed to wait
6617.52 for the mouse doesn't want to wait
6619.08 anymore they just go after the food
6621.36 um I've been that Mouse yeah we've all
6623.1 been oh we could all relate with this uh
6626.28 to a certain extent against the Spectrum
6627.78 so
6630.239 um
6630.96 so in any case I uh non-sequitur but I I
6633.9 I certainly think that there is a way to
6637.679 use our own body's physiology
6640.679 to anticipate
6643.139 when these impulses are coming online
6645.02 how best to do that I think we're just
6647.699 scratching the surface but these are the
6650.82 kinds of solutions we need these are
6654.3 some of these problems are of epidemic
6656.58 proportions the largest public health
6658.44 problems in this country in this world
6660.239 obesity opiate crisis depression
6662.9 suicidality I mean that's like a third
6664.8 of our country maybe more probably more
6667.32 and think about it and a colleague of
6669.54 ours at Stanford Psychiatry told me
6671.1 something that still just blows my mind
6673.199 which is that something like 75 percent
6676.4 of the antidepressant and anti-anxiety
6679.739 medication that exists in the world is
6681.719 consumed in the United States it's
6683.58 amazing which is I mean that's an
6685.56 outrageous number yeah we do have an
6687.36 obsession in this country for pharmacy
6688.619 you know and the pharmaceutical industry
6691.739 is very powerful here and probably
6693.78 related some aspect of capitalism I'm
6695.94 capitalistic and just like everybody
6698.159 else but um I do worry about that a
6700.619 little bit
6701.82 um but you know we tend to over
6704.04 prescribe and I think we as patients
6705.96 tend to over want medication we like
6710.04 quick Solutions and sometimes
6711.6 medications provided sometimes not or
6713.28 they're often just abandoned depends on
6715.02 the problem of course
6716.28 so
6718.199 um but but I I agree that we need
6721.08 scalable Solutions but you know I'm a
6723.42 neurosurgeon I'm only going to be able
6724.8 to treat the most severe of patients
6726.9 with these problems you know you know
6729.659 we've only done about 200 000 deep brain
6732.78 stimulation surgeries ever
6735.3 so I mean the problem we're talking
6737.4 about here is
6739.02 50 million Americans there's no
6741.6 possibility that surgeons can address
6743.52 that problem but we could help Inspire
6746.88 an initiative to go after that kind of
6749.159 problem or help make it more rigorous
6751.199 because the last thing we need is a you
6753.719 know some sort of wearable fancy tool
6755.58 that you know
6757.52 uh waste people's money and time you
6760.56 know we need real therapies for these
6762.06 things not that these devices that we're
6763.8 discussing are not uh I think actually
6765.42 there's lots of promise we use machine
6767.699 learning in the lab all the time I'm not
6769.56 a an electrical engineer or the
6771.84 computational neuroscientist doing this
6773.58 type of work I I just helped develop the
6775.26 hypotheses around it but um and help
6777.6 fundraise around it but I I definitely
6779.82 think there's a future for it I just I I
6782.04 suspect we're scratching the surface on
6783.719 how best to do it
6785.28 let's talk about your hands yeah sure
6788.219 all the neurosurgeons I know are you
6790.98 know very Faithfully protect their hands
6793.58 because talking about insurance is too
6795.6 expensive that's it right but I'm
6798.119 guessing that you you all are not the
6800.76 ones to reach into the garbage disposal
6802.679 even if your eye is on the switch to
6804.78 make sure that it isn't going to get
6806.1 turned on they're just too precious they
6807.6 are your livelihood yeah um and earlier
6810.6 we talked about deadlifts uh there are
6812.4 other forms of exercise
6813.96 um they're things like tennis
6816.119 um they're they're drawing and painting
6818.159 a full range of things that one can do
6819.54 with their hands use your imagination
6820.86 sure
6822.36 um is it true that neurosurgeons don't
6825.659 do any uh really like heavy grip
6828.84 activity because it can
6831.02 refine the motor motor circuits in the
6834.78 brain and elsewhere that can throw off
6837.179 their neurosurgery game
6839.52 I would say that
6841.8 many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities
6846.179 that put their hands at risk um another
6848.28 one by the way you know there's a uh an
6850.38 annual uh softball tournament uh that uh
6855.139 neurosurgeons come to in New York City
6857.159 in Central Park with a very softball no
6859.5 I'm just kidding well actually it's
6860.88 actually a very you know typical hard
6863.76 softball I don't know why they call it
6865.199 softball and uh actually a two close
6868.32 colleagues of mine have gotten injured
6870.06 at that tournament maybe this is a it's
6871.98 also I must say and here I'm poking fun
6874.02 but for those of you who are going in
6875.52 the medical profession it's also one of
6877.98 the more uh how should I say this well
6879.6 I'm just going to say it there's a steep
6881.699 hierarchy of training in neurosurgery
6883.679 yes
6884.58 um there's a certain harshness that's
6886.08 been conveyed to me about the training
6888.179 uh much like Astronaut training to be
6890.639 totally fair and so maybe this is a
6892.739 tactic to uh to weed out either the
6895.32 younger or the older generation it says
6898.08 Evolution right we uh have to evolve and
6900.36 we need in medical the week I guess well
6903.36 I I could say that one of the
6904.739 individuals that got injured is one of
6906.179 the more senior surgeons that I work
6907.56 with now and is one of the best athletes
6909.84 that I know and he's definitely not weak
6911.639 but you can get injured playing these
6913.32 Sports and uh that being said I can tell
6915.78 you briefly is um I think that you know
6919.92 it's funny my my mother came to me
6921.42 recently she's she has osteopenia and
6924.36 she told me her doctor told her she's
6925.739 not allowed to do deadlifts and I was
6927.719 like okay
6928.86 um that's fine uh I'm not telling you
6931.26 you should do deadlifts I just don't
6932.639 exactly understand the relationship but
6935.34 um
6936.239 I can say that I do think
6938.94 I'll give you a little story here the
6941.04 reason why I'm being a little hesitant
6942.719 to to confirm that I agree with you on
6944.34 the deadlifts is I um
6947.1 when I was operating this is when I was
6948.9 at Stanford University operating and uh
6951.9 we as I mentioned earlier we get an
6953.699 interoperative CAT scan uh to confirm
6955.44 accuracy of our lectures I do this for
6956.639 all of my surgeries when I was reviewing
6958.679 that CAT scan the x-ray technician
6960.78 looked at me and said whispered into my
6963.48 ear he's like your posture
6965.639 really bad embarrassing your physical
6968.639 posture while doing your surgeries yeah
6970.32 and I looked at him and I kind of wanted
6972.54 to say I won't curse but yeah exactly
6975.3 I've been doing it intermittently during
6976.86 our conversation because he made me
6978.659 realize that I really did have bad
6980.159 posture and
6981.9 um we kind of had a little brief aside
6983.76 and he I learned he was a personal
6985.199 trainer and uh his name was Zach and he
6988.679 uh you know he said to me you know your
6990.78 posture is weak because or your posture
6992.88 is poor because you're weak you need to
6995.1 strengthen your body and strengthen your
6997.199 core I was like how he's like power
7000.5 lifting and I'm like I'm a little
7002.48 hesitant to do this and I'll tell you I
7004.58 started very slowly and I can't
7006.679 prescribe power lifting to everybody for
7008.3 the exact reason you said um and I've
7010.219 gotten hurt doing it by the way but I do
7012.92 think
7013.82 I I wish I started a little younger
7016.4 and I would argue that with close
7019.04 supervision and very
7021.86 well if you are if you have a very
7024.619 experienced trainer which I would argue
7026.84 if you're a neurosurgeon or an astronaut
7028.4 uh or or have a highly specialized
7030.739 profession where you need your your
7032.78 limbs to to function dentists things
7035.84 like that
7037.099 um if you're going to take something on
7038.179 like this it really needs to be
7039.5 extremely carefully supervised and I can
7041.48 tell you that you know my trainer had a
7043.699 profound impact on my life and my
7045.5 posture and my my physical health and so
7048.56 uh we did deadlift I'll admit so when
7051.199 you brought it up I kind of chuckled to
7052.76 myself but uh yes I I have gotten mildly
7056.42 hurt deadlifting but it was when I was
7057.679 doing it by myself and I was kind of
7059.3 cocky and I wasn't paying attention but
7061.28 when I was with him and he was all over
7063.32 my technique
7065.0 it actually was the most efficient way
7066.92 for me to feel stronger and it improved
7069.38 my posture uh significantly and I I miss
7072.44 him since I left California I I have a
7074.96 new trainer in Philadelphia who's great
7076.159 but uh uh and and I still deadlift
7078.8 occasionally with him but I uh I I can
7081.08 say I I am opposed to deadlifting
7083.38 callously but if you're
7085.76 extremely well monitored by it
7088.04 experienced
7089.42 um personal trainer or weight lifter uh
7091.58 I think it could be a great exercise
7092.96 great I love to be wrong in this case
7096.679 um because I'm a huge proponent and on
7099.199 the podcast I go on and on I mean
7100.46 they're so there's so much data now
7102.44 pointing the fact that 100 and 180 to
7106.34 200 minutes of Zone 2 cardio kind of
7108.38 jogging cycling swimming type behavior
7110.36 is very healthy for everybody and we
7112.04 should all be doing that at least that
7113.659 yes I need to as well and that
7115.52 resistance training on the order of you
7118.28 know six hard sets per muscle group per
7120.139 week are it's really important just to
7121.58 offset deterioration of muscles and I'm
7124.099 learning skeletal function and tendon
7126.8 strength and that's just to maintain
7128.239 we're not talking about all out sets to
7130.4 Absolute failure but as you point out
7132.32 with um with proper form so even the
7135.139 neurosurgeons are doing this which I
7137.42 think is is wonderful yes as a final
7140.84 question
7141.98 um but one that I think really or maybe
7145.34 second to final question earlier I
7147.5 commented on the remarkable calm at
7150.5 least perceived calm of neurosurgeons it
7154.159 could be caused or could be effective
7155.84 the training but it's obvious to me why
7158.239 one would want that trait in their
7161.54 neurosurgeon
7162.98 um I wouldn't want to hyperactive
7164.78 certainly not an impulsive neurosurgeon
7166.94 given that the margins of error are so
7169.4 so tiny the spatial scale and probably
7172.099 on the temporal scale too yes and you
7174.199 don't want people doing things in time
7175.76 that are or being spontaneous at all
7179.78 do you think that this branch of
7182.3 medicine that you're in selects for
7183.92 people that at least can know how to
7187.28 control any kind of fluctuations in
7189.32 autonomic growl so they can calm
7190.82 themselves in real time and here's a
7192.8 specific question when I've never
7194.36 operated on the human brain although
7196.04 I've had the privilege of being in the
7197.36 operating room and seeing this with some
7199.219 of our experiments with people in VR
7200.96 it's a remarkable thing I wish for
7203.42 everybody that would get this experience
7204.8 at some point not hopefully as a patient
7206.659 unless they have a need but to observe
7208.639 it but what was just striking to me is
7213.159 the various uh stereotype behaviors of
7217.219 the surgeon and when I did surgeries as
7219.38 a graduate student as a postdoc in the
7221.3 brains of other types of animals I would
7222.98 find for instance that if I started to
7224.42 tremble a little bit if I tapped my left
7226.58 foot that my hand would stabilize a bit
7228.56 that there's this kind of need to move
7230.179 the body or one feels the impulse maybe
7231.8 that's my my Tourette's like compulsions
7234.38 again but but that one can kind of um
7237.739 siphon off some of that energy into
7239.9 another limb so that you could remain
7241.76 precise so are these sorts of things
7244.94 that I'm talking about are maybe it's
7246.56 entirely my imagination but are these
7249.199 the sorts of things that one learns as a
7250.699 neurosurgeon how to still the body and
7252.8 still the Mind do you have a meditative
7255.199 practice when you go into the operating
7256.82 room if you had a particularly
7258.86 challenging morning or or a poor night's
7261.08 sleep do you have tools that you use to
7263.54 calibrate yourself and get yourself into
7265.699 the Zone I think this would be very
7267.98 interesting for people to get some
7269.179 insight into even if they don't want to
7270.86 be a neurosurgeon yeah I completely
7272.9 agree and I I appreciate the earlier uh
7275.96 reference to neurosurgeons as uh
7278.179 astronauts because I've also heard you
7280.4 know us compared to Cowboys before and
7282.32 it's a little bit less flattering I uh
7284.54 you know
7287.0 some of what we do surgically really
7289.34 does require a substantial amount of
7291.56 confidence
7292.58 um and that confidence hopefully comes
7295.58 from years of training and experience
7299.42 um
7300.08 you always worry that the confidence is
7302.48 sort of misplaced and that that is
7304.699 problematic luckily I you so rarely see
7307.219 that because our training is so rigorous
7309.38 you know we have a board of uh American
7313.28 Board of neurological surgeons that uh
7316.04 sort of allows and and assesses surgeons
7319.94 to continue practice and holds us to a
7323.36 really high bar I do think it tends to
7326.48 attract a certain personality uh in my
7330.139 sub-specialty as a like a deep brain
7332.06 stimulation surgeon we call it
7333.199 stereotactic and functional neurosurgery
7335.0 you know some people have likened us to
7336.98 the neurologists with a scalpel
7339.38 um we we tend to be a bit more
7340.88 intellectual
7342.199 um uh maybe maybe bedside manner is a
7345.98 little bit friendlier
7347.42 um and then there's the vascular
7349.04 neurosurgeon who doesn't sleep and so
7350.96 they're not as friendly there's the
7352.58 spine surgeons who operate the most and
7355.159 so they're you know busy busy busy uh we
7358.04 there are some of these kind of
7359.3 reputations going around but I I agree
7361.34 with you there's a sort of a common
7362.84 feature of of a calmness across
7365.42 neurosurgeons and you know there's some
7367.52 of my obviously my favorite people my
7369.139 closest friends
7370.46 um and I I can relate with them probably
7373.04 because of that
7374.719 um sort of a big picture they don't get
7377.119 sort of uh flustered uh they they tend
7381.619 to
7382.76 are they tend to be really good at
7385.34 figuring out how to have quality time
7387.02 because we work really hard our hours
7388.88 are uh significant and so the time with
7391.94 our families our friends is less than we
7395.42 would like it to be
7396.739 um that obviously that's true for people
7398.3 who work hard across any profession but
7400.46 definitely true for neurosurgeons and I
7402.739 think that we're very good at figuring
7404.239 out how to make that time high quality
7406.639 um you know even just texting with some
7409.219 of my friends
7410.48 um in that are that are neurosurgeons a
7412.219 great friend of mine just became
7413.239 chairman at Duke and just connecting
7415.219 with him by text which takes seconds you
7418.82 know you feel we feel connected you know
7420.679 and I I think that's a that's a trait
7423.02 amongst neurosurgeons we sort of know
7424.4 how to cut to the chase in a way
7426.8 um and prioritize our time it's a skill
7429.08 that we probably
7430.639 have innately but is also part of the
7433.28 training you know when we are interns
7435.5 now there's a lot of work hour
7436.94 regulations that is probably quite
7438.92 appropriate by the way
7440.36 um I I think our hours before were
7443.239 bordering uh on on uh on not necessarily
7446.78 let's just say they were not ideal for
7449.48 mental health and sleep which we know
7452.06 are very important components um
7453.98 certainly we had no time for meditation
7455.36 I definitely did not I wish I did
7458.36 um now knowing what I know about
7460.699 meditation my wife's a health coach I I
7463.219 get it I see it I I practice it myself
7466.159 with her
7467.84 um I see the value I wish I had that
7469.58 tool when I was in training because it's
7471.32 stressful
7472.52 um you know you even with workout
7474.619 restrictions we still don't sleep very
7476.06 much we're still at work a lot about 80
7477.86 hours you know a week throughout the
7480.32 entire career uh there are times when
7482.78 it's more because after training there's
7485.719 no work hour restrictions so sometimes I
7488.239 feel like as faculty we get abused and
7491.36 the trainees are a little bit more
7492.679 protected now it definitely was the
7494.599 reverse at one point and that's also a
7496.219 huge problem probably more of a problem
7498.38 um and I'm joking a little bit I don't
7500.0 necessarily think we're abused but
7501.44 certainly our hours are significant
7504.26 um
7505.159 but you know they come a bit more here
7508.28 and there you know on my or days when
7510.199 I'm operating those are long days but on
7512.179 the days that I'm lucky enough to be a
7514.46 researcher you know uh like you those
7516.5 days tend to be a bit gentler unless I'm
7518.36 great writing those days can be long as
7520.219 you know
7522.139 um so I so to answer your question I do
7524.3 think we're we're sort of self-selected
7525.92 for it but I also think it's part of the
7527.3 training you know we because of the long
7529.34 hours that we're in the hospital we're
7531.08 taking care of sick patients and we have
7533.719 sort of a type a mentor approach where
7537.08 our mentors are hard on us
7539.0 you know we learn to cope with our
7541.099 stress and be efficient and prioritize
7544.099 things despite the stress of it all and
7547.76 I think you know we take from that this
7550.34 sort of calm demeanor and you know
7552.619 perhaps
7553.88 um perhaps it's just amplifies what we
7556.52 were probably drawn to because before we
7558.8 come to neurosurgery we want rotated
7560.54 neurosurgery we might spend a month you
7563.179 know pretending to be a neurosurgeon
7565.28 learning from residents and and faculty
7568.219 that are practicing the specialty but
7570.44 you know prior to actually starting your
7572.719 training you you never experience
7574.639 anything like being a resident in
7576.619 neurosurgery uh the stress and the
7579.44 volume of patients that you have to take
7581.0 care of and the long nights it can be
7583.58 quite Lonely by the way
7585.26 um you develop friends in the hospital
7586.58 but sometimes you're on your own when
7588.92 you're on call and you have backup you
7590.48 can call your chief resident or you're
7592.52 attending but you really have to learn
7593.84 how to take care of patients yourself
7595.58 you obviously form teams with nurses and
7598.099 staff and things like that and other
7599.54 residents but it can be lonely it can be
7601.76 really challenging and I think because
7604.219 of those experiences that all
7605.9 neurosurgeons go through uh
7608.78 you know we tend to have this sort of
7612.4 unflappable personality that perhaps we
7615.86 started with a bit compared to the
7617.719 average person but the training
7619.52 definitely amplifies it and do you have
7622.28 tools that you implement if you ever
7625.099 feel that you're getting slightly
7626.42 off-center
7627.619 I do now
7629.36 um
7630.08 you know I
7631.88 when I was in training I actually
7634.46 remember in my
7636.92 second year so most neurosurgery
7639.86 programs when you're a junior resident
7641.54 in some ways that's your toughest year
7643.699 not in every way
7645.26 um
7646.219 it is your toughest year because you're
7648.44 you're young and you're inexperienced
7650.119 and you don't know what you don't know
7652.099 and and that that's why it's such a
7653.9 tough year because you have to learn a
7655.159 lot very quickly for patient safety
7657.38 reasons for self-survival you know you
7660.08 just have to learn a lot
7661.699 um and you're on call by yourself in the
7664.159 hospital and it's uh it's a real
7666.32 Challenge and I think that you know I
7668.42 you know personally I I gained a lot of
7670.219 weight during that year the only
7671.78 exercise I did consciously was taking
7674.06 the stairs I refused to take the
7675.32 elevator and I was at uh Penn at HUB
7678.32 where I currently practice now
7680.119 and I remember I would see patients
7682.52 anywhere from sort of the ground floor
7684.02 where the Chama Bay was or the ER all
7686.48 the way up to Founders 12th 12th floor
7688.159 and I would never take an elevator that
7690.02 was my rule for the year because I knew
7691.34 I would not have time to exercise but I
7693.619 would just take the stairs and in the
7695.119 beginning of the year I would be a
7696.38 little winded when I got to the 12th
7697.82 floor but by the end of the year
7699.32 actually it didn't really phase me it
7701.0 became a great Habit to have
7703.28 um the problem with that though is I
7705.619 paired that unfortunately with you know
7708.139 a lot of sleepless nights or not enough
7709.88 sleep let's say
7711.26 and I had this terrible habit of
7714.86 drinking coffee late at night and I
7716.96 would put a lot of sugar in it and it
7718.88 was sort of the only way for me to get a
7720.38 quick you know um a quick bout of energy
7723.739 that for some reason I prioritized at
7725.659 that time obviously knowing that I would
7727.699 crash which I always did and I always
7729.56 kind of regretted it but I still did it
7730.94 anyway and I I attribute that to poor
7734.3 decision making inexperience
7736.82 um and perhaps being a little vulnerable
7738.619 like I think we all are that's why I
7740.719 relate with a lot of the research that I
7742.219 do and I remember I got married in my
7745.099 third year the year after my second year
7746.84 and my wife and I or my fiance at the
7749.179 time we started going to the gym
7750.739 together in the morning and my hours
7752.84 were a little better so I would actually
7754.34 be able to exercise before I operated
7756.26 that day and I operated almost every day
7758.06 as a third year resident so I remember
7759.739 I'd get to the gym really early in three
7761.84 months I lost like 20 pounds and I
7763.52 wasn't trying to lose weight I just was
7764.96 sleeping better and taking care of
7766.82 myself and I remember when we got
7768.5 married I I you know I fit into a tuxedo
7771.8 that I had in college or it would have
7773.239 fit me in college it actually was a new
7774.5 tuxedo admittedly but it was the same
7775.88 size as my tuxedo from college so I I
7778.58 think that um I've always related with
7781.04 the problems that our our patients have
7782.96 to a certain extent and you know I when
7786.199 I've been most vulnerable which is what
7787.88 I was working the hardest with the least
7789.679 amount of sleep I I related with it the
7791.48 most and
7792.98 yes exercise for me has always been my
7795.32 tool
7796.4 um more recently exercise some some you
7800.179 know strength training I think is
7801.38 important compared with cardio
7803.54 um I don't do enough of either
7805.4 um but I definitely do some and that
7806.9 helps meditation helps me a bit we I do
7809.48 that every night before I go to sleep
7811.4 um
7812.179 you know I I use an app for it it's
7814.52 probably not the best way to do
7815.719 meditation but if it keeps you doing it
7817.46 regularly that's the best way to do it
7819.199 Andrew I couldn't agree with you more
7820.76 you know it's one of those things where
7822.02 I look forward to it every night and you
7824.36 know sometimes my wife falls asleep and
7827.06 I come to bed a little later and I
7828.619 whisper I'm like are you okay if I turn
7829.76 the app on so you know she does the same
7832.34 to me because I think we both value it
7834.02 and I think that's that that's been very
7835.58 helpful I didn't have that tool probably
7838.159 what I needed it most but I have it now
7839.719 and it's very helpful
7841.58 I really appreciate you sharing those
7843.86 tools a number of people uh I'm guessing
7846.619 out there might want to become
7847.699 neurosurgeons I really believe that in
7849.739 hearing today's conversation that you
7851.599 will spark an interest in medicine and
7853.52 or neurosurgery
7855.38 um well certainly you need to be a a
7857.119 physician before you can become a
7858.5 neurosurgeon so end neurosurgery in some
7860.36 cases and that would be beautiful and I
7862.46 predict that will be happen that will
7863.96 happen excuse me as a consequence of
7866.599 um what you've shared today I really
7869.06 appreciate your mentioning of the um
7871.76 emphasis and appreciation on quality
7874.58 time uh I very much see this as quality
7877.52 time I know that our listeners were will
7880.159 as well really want to thank you for
7881.659 taking time out of your not just
7883.099 immensely busy but very important
7884.78 schedule because again the work that
7887.119 you're doing is really out there on that
7889.639 cutting I don't want to say bleeding
7891.86 edge because in this context it's not
7893.179 going to sound right but on that extreme
7895.52 Cutting Edge of what we understand about
7897.199 how the human brain works and how it can
7898.82 be repaired
7900.02 um they're doing marvelous work will
7902.0 Point people to various places they can
7904.639 find you online and should they need
7908.239 your the help of your clinic to to your
7910.4 clinic and your laboratory as well so on
7912.86 behalf of everybody and and myself as

7974.78 Lab podcast we talk about supplements
7976.52 while supplements aren't necessary for
7978.26 everybody many people drive tremendous
7980.3 benefit from them for things like
7981.56 enhancing sleep and focus and hormone
7983.42 optimization the huberman Lab podcast
7985.52 has partnered with momentous supplements
7987.26 if you'd like to see the supplements of
7988.46 the huberman Lab podcast has partnered
