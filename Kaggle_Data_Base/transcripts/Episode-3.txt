0.179 welcome to the huberman Lab podcast
1.92 where we discuss science and
3.959 science-based tools for everyday life
8.88 I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor
10.92 of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at
13.259 Stanford school of medicine today my
15.299 guest is Dr Sarah Gottfried Dr Sarah
17.58 Gottfried is an obstetrician
19.199 gynecologist who did her undergraduate
21.359 training in bioengineering at the
23.34 University of Washington in Seattle she
25.619 then completed her medical training at
27.3 Harvard Medical School and she currently
29.279 is a clinical professor of Integrative
30.96 Medicine and nutritional Sciences at
32.94 Thomas Jefferson University she has also
35.52 been a clinician treating men and women
38.04 in various aspects of Hormone Health and
40.559 Longevity for more than 20 years
43.14 she is an expert in not just traditional
45.48 medicine as it relates to hormones and
47.16 fertility but also nutritional practices
49.86 supplementation and behavioral practices
51.96 and combining all of that expertise in
54.719 order to help women navigate every
56.399 aspect and dimension of their hormones
58.379 longevity and vitality ranging from
60.78 puberty to Young adulthood adulthood
64.04 perimenopause and menopause and nowadays
66.72 she's also treating men across the
68.939 lifespan in terms of longevity vitality
70.979 and Hormone Health during today's
72.659 discussion Dr Gottfried shares an
74.4 enormous amount of information and tools
76.799 that women can apply toward their
78.6 Hormone Health fertility vitality and
81.06 longevity we discussed the gut
83.22 microbiome which many people have heard
84.78 about but Dr Godfrey points out the
87.0 specific needs that women have in terms
88.619 of managing their gut microbiome and the
90.72 ways that that influences things like
92.34 estrogen levels and Metabolism
93.84 testosterone thyroid and growth hormone
96.06 and much more we also discussed
98.28 nutrition and exercise we touch on how
100.979 the omega-3 fatty acids play a
102.9 particularly important role in managing
104.82 female hormone Health Dr Gottfried
106.74 points out why women have particular
108.479 needs when it comes to essential fatty
110.46 acids and how best to obtain those
112.38 essential fatty acids for Hormone Health
114.36 we also discuss exercise and she offers
117.899 some surprising information about the
119.759 types and ratios of resistance training
122.1 to cardiovascular training that women
124.2 ought to use in order to maximize their
125.939 Hormone Health
127.02 we also talk a lot about the digestive
129.06 system this was a surprising aspect of
130.86 the conversation I did not anticipate Dr
132.78 Gottfried shared with us for instance
134.28 that women suffer from digestive issues
136.44 at more than 10 times the frequency that
138.36 do men and fortunately that there are
140.4 tools specific to women that they can
142.319 use in order to overcome those digestive
144.42 issues and that in overcoming those
146.76 digestive issues they can overcome many
148.739 of the related hormone issues that so
150.78 many women face Dr Gottfried also shares
153.12 with you tremendous knowledge about the
155.22 specific types of tests not just blood
156.959 tests but also urine and microbiome
158.76 tests that women can use in order to
161.459 really get a clear understanding of
163.44 their hormone status not just of present
166.319 but also where the trajectory of their
168.78 hormones is taking them so we have an
170.819 avid discussion about puberty about
173.22 young adulthood adulthood perimenopause
175.92 and how best to manage and navigate
177.78 perimenopause and menopause including a
181.019 discussion about hormone replacement
182.22 therapy in addition to her academic and
184.56 clinical expertise Dr Gottfried has
186.36 authored many import important books on
187.98 nutrition hormones and supplementation
190.019 as it relates to women and to people
192.18 generally the two books that I'd like to
194.34 highlight and that we've provided links
195.78 to in the show note captions are women
197.819 food and hormones and the hormone cure I
200.76 read the hormone cure and found it to be
202.5 tremendously interesting and informative
204.18 not just in terms of teaching me about
205.92 female hormone health and various
207.3 treatments for female hormone Health but
209.4 also as a man trying to understand how
211.86 the endocrine system interacts with
213.599 mindset nutrition and supplementation
215.7 more generally so I highly recommend the
217.8 hormone cure for anybody interested in
219.659 hormones and Hormone Health and women
221.4 food and hormones in particular for
223.14 women although again both books are
225.36 going to be strongly informative for
226.86 women wishing to optimize their Hormone
228.78 Health vitality and Longevity before we
231.42 begin I'd like to emphasize that this
233.04 podcast is separate from my teaching and
234.72 research roles at Stanford it is however
236.879 part of my desire and effort to bring
238.799 zero cost to Consumer information about
240.659 science and science related tools to the
242.819 general public in keeping with that
244.62 theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of
246.42 today's podcast cast our first sponsor
248.64 is Roka Roka makes eyeglasses and
251.22 sunglasses that are the absolute highest
253.379 quality I spent a lifetime working on
255.239 the biology of the visual system and I
257.16 can tell you that your visual system has
258.54 to contend with an enormous number of
259.919 challenges in order for you to be able
261.6 to see clearly so for instance when you
263.34 go from a very brightly lit area to a
265.08 dimlet area your visual system has to
267.18 make all sorts of adjustments that allow
268.919 you to still see your environment Roca
271.08 eyeglasses and sunglasses were built
272.82 with the biology of the visual system in
274.62 mind so no matter what environment
276.24 you're in you'll be able to see with
277.919 perfect clarity and they have terrific
279.96 Aesthetics an enormous number of choices
282.0 in terms of Aesthetics so unlike a lot
283.68 of so-called performance eyeglasses out
285.54 there that only give you the option to
287.88 wear the ones that make you look like a
289.08 cyborg they have those options but they
290.88 also have a lot of options with
292.44 Aesthetics that you would be perfectly
294.0 comfortable wearing to work or to dinner
295.62 or anywhere else if you'd like to try

310.32 also brought To Us by thesis thesis
312.479 makes custom nootropics and as many of
314.639 you know I'm not a fan of the word
316.139 nootropics because nootropics means
317.88 smart drugs and as a neuroscientist I
320.58 can tell you there is no neural circuit
322.32 in the brain for being smart thesis
324.539 understands this and has designed
326.16 different nootropics in order to bring
328.02 your brain into specific States for
329.94 specific types of work so for instance
331.56 for Creative work or to engage with more
334.44 Focus or to give you more energy for
336.36 cognitive or physical work so with
338.039 thesis they'll design custom nootropics
339.96 for you that will allow you more focus
342.12 better task switching more creativity
343.979 and so on and they'll be sure to include
346.32 only the ingredients that you want and
347.94 not the ingredients that you don't I've
349.919 been using thesis for more than a year
351.66 now and I can confidently say that their
353.46 neutropics have been a total game
354.84 changer for me I like the clarity
356.94 formula prior to Long bouts of cognitive
358.919 work or the Energy Formula prior to
361.02 physical workouts if you'd like to try
363.18 your own personalized nootropic starter
364.86 kit go online to takethesis.com huberman
367.68 you'll take a brief three-minute quiz
369.6 and thesis will send you four different
370.979 formulas to try on your first month
372.6 again that's takethesis.com huberman and
375.6 use the code Huber minute checkout for
377.16 10 off your first box today's episode is
379.86 also brought To Us by element element is
382.08 an electrolyte drink that has everything
383.58 you need and nothing you don't that
385.319 means the exact ratios of electrolytes
387.66 are an element and those are sodium
389.819 magnesium and potassium but it has no
392.4 sugar I've talked many times before on
394.319 this podcast about the key role of
395.94 hydration and electrolytes for nerve
399.66 cell function neuron function as well as
401.34 the function of all the cells and all
403.139 the tissues and organ systems of the
404.699 body
405.479 if we have sodium magnesium and
407.58 potassium present in the proper ratios
409.319 all of those cells function properly and
411.9 all our bodily systems can be optimized
414.36 if the electrolytes are not present and
416.639 if hydration is low we simply can't
419.1 think as well as we would otherwise our
421.56 mood is off hormone systems go off our
423.78 ability to get into physical action to
425.94 engage in endurance and strength and all
427.74 sorts of other things is diminished so
430.259 with element you can make sure that
431.699 you're staying on top of your hydration
433.02 and that you're getting the proper
434.699 ratios of electrolytes if you'd like to
436.62 try element you can go to drink element
438.24 that's lmnt.com huberman and you'll get
441.419 a free element sample pack with your
443.039 purchase they're all delicious so again

450.18 podcast is now partnered with momentous
451.86 supplements to find the supplements we
453.479 discuss on the huberman Lab podcast you
455.22 can go to live momentous spelled ous
457.139 live momentous.com huberman and I should
460.5 just mention that the library of those
461.759 supplements is constantly expanding
463.5 again that's livmentis.com slash
466.08 huberman and now for my discussion with
468.599 Dr Sarah Gottfried Dr Gottfried Sarah
471.18 welcome thank you so happy to be here
473.58 yeah I'm delighted and very excited to
475.68 ask you about an enormous number of
477.479 topics here we are expert in so so many
479.94 things so uh the challenge for me is
482.28 going to be to constrain this walk as it
485.4 were but I'm hoping that we can touch on
487.68 a great number of things today the first
490.02 of which
491.12 is really about
493.5 hormones and female hormones in
496.02 particular and I have a question which
498.36 is
499.919 is it ever informative for a woman
502.379 regardless of age to know something
504.419 about
505.319 her mother's perhaps even her
507.479 grandmother's experience vis-a-vis
509.819 hormones not just pregnancy
512.76 challenges with or
515.039 um ease with pregnancy and child rearing
518.219 childbirth this sort of thing but you
520.38 know what sorts of conversations should
522.24 women be having with themselves and with
524.82 family members to get a window into what
527.58 their specific needs might be love this
530.519 question
531.54 so my work is really at the interface
534.24 between genetics and environment so your
537.24 question gets to
538.8 both
540.12 and I think it's essential that you
542.519 understand
543.5 what your
545.279 grandmother went through I'd even say
547.44 your great grandmother depending on
548.64 longevity in your family so I grew up
550.56 with my great-grandmother I get that
552.779 and especially your mother
554.94 so
556.14 I would probably start first with trauma
559.38 an intergenerational trauma because I
561.839 think that affects the endocrine system
564.06 so hugely especially cortisol signaling
566.88 but
568.44 the broader Pine system
571.82 psychoimmunuroendocrine system
574.08 and then there's you know if I think
575.82 about
577.32 the stages the life cycle that a woman
579.66 goes through
581.339 if you think about puberty I think I
584.7 don't know how
586.26 genetically determine the age of puberty
588.48 is certainly there's a lot of
589.8 environmental influences like toxins can
592.74 affect it
594.06 but
595.44 um pregnancy
598.019 the age at which you start to go through
600.12 perimenopause menopause many of those
602.88 have a genetic component
605.88 so with pregnancy I mean you can
607.38 certainly think
608.94 the shape of the pelvis your ability to
611.7 have a vaginal birth
613.62 some of that is genetically determined I
615.42 mean you do have you know the the sperm
618.0 donor affecting some of that but you
621.24 know in my family for instance we have
622.74 no cesarean sections so everyone goes
626.1 through this process of a relatively
628.92 easy vaginal birth I was a forceps baby
631.8 but you know for the most part
634.86 um you can find out about that and then
636.3 there's certain female conditions that
639.6 have a very strong component genetically
642.779 most of which run in my family so that
645.72 includes endometriosis
648.019 fibroids I just had a hysterectomy I
651.42 added 50 plus fibroids
653.7 and polycystic ovarian syndrome
657.12 and of those three uh how frequent are
659.76 those and maybe I can constrain the
662.1 question a little bit by saying
663.779 um today's discussion I imagine is going
665.579 to be heard by men and women of all
667.2 sorts of Ages so I uh maybe I'll direct
669.36 the question a little bit toward you
671.519 know at what age should these
672.779 discussions start
675.18 um you know we always imagine that women
678.18 in their 30s and 40s and 50s and onward
681.3 should be getting certain tests and
683.22 addressing things like uh ovarian
685.68 reserve and and other sorts of things
687.839 but you know maybe we could March
690.18 through and just say for a woman in her
693.0 teens who's already hit puberty what
695.7 sorts of biomarkers whether or not
697.62 they're blood-based or per or
699.839 um phenotyping you know the outward
702.0 appearance of uh
703.86 should those young women be paying
706.019 attention to likewise for women in their
707.94 20s 30s maybe we could take it more or
709.98 less by by decade at starting at puberty
712.56 assuming that woman hits puberty
714.36 sometime what between what is it now the
716.459 average in the U.S is somewhere between
717.839 12 and 16 years old do I have that right
720.24 no you do not oh great so that's to be
722.64 wrong so so it used to be 12 to 16. I
727.14 would say 50 years ago
729.48 it's been moving younger and we think
733.56 some of that is related to toxin
735.36 exposure as I mentioned but I was 10
737.88 when I went through puberty so uh well I
741.48 should say menarchy and I started
744.12 growing breasts much before that so
747.48 I think
749.579 now I'm going to step away from the
750.899 science for a moment I'm going to do
752.16 that pretty fluidly and I'll try to call
753.779 it out
754.98 I think there's also a huge influence
757.26 from stress
759.06 and like the development of the adrenal
761.16 glands
762.36 so going back to the science
766.019 the issue in teenage years is that the
770.76 hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis
774.6 and I like to think of it broader so
778.019 stay with me hypothalamic pituitary
780.24 adrenal gonadol a recent women testes
784.019 men
784.86 thyroid
786.36 gut axis
788.1 so that to me is the control system so
790.62 I'm kind of
792.0 expressing my bioengineering side here
794.22 well I think it's great to include the
795.66 other organs and tissue systems of the
797.459 body because as we both know that the
799.98 narrow definition of just hypothalamic
801.959 pituitary adrenal it can't be just that
804.6 right no it can't no yeah it doesn't
807.48 tell the whole story
808.98 so if you look at
811.079 the
812.279 the main sex hormones
814.62 in a a young woman who's in her teenage
817.26 years the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal
820.26 gonadal part of that is not fully mature
823.98 so they're more likely to skip periods
825.959 especially under stress they have a lot
829.2 of influences it really doesn't get well
831.0 established until you're done with
832.98 adolescence and I'm told that
834.959 adolescence now is still like age 25 to
837.3 26. I heard that and I was like I've got
840.24 two daughters and I was like that's a
842.339 really long time and not just a
844.38 psychologically defined or bio
846.8 psychosocial mostly psychologically
849.48 defined I heard that from a psychologist
853.26 so
855.3 biomarkers you asked about in your
857.76 teenage years what I think is really
859.44 interesting is to look at cortisol
862.44 to look at the dance between estrogen
865.26 and progesterone in those years is less
867.839 helpful because I think there's a lot of
870.12 variability due to the immaturity of the
872.16 system if you've got someone who's got
874.32 really regular periods it's probably
876.36 better to do some benchmarking at that
878.339 age but generally I find that
880.019 benchmarking
881.579 is best performed in your 20s or 30s are
884.76 periods not that regular in terms of
886.74 duration of the menstrual cycle when the
890.579 menstrual cycle first sets in
892.62 it depends so I was like clockwork every
895.98 28 days until I had my hysterectomy in
898.86 August
900.12 same thing with my daughters I've got
902.16 two daughters one's 17 the other is 23.
906.42 for a lot of women they're not regular
909.12 and then there's the whole piece of oral
912.06 contraceptives and other forms of
913.8 contraception where you have no idea
916.019 what the normal cycle is and I hope
918.42 we'll have some time to talk a little
920.1 bit about oral contraceptives because I
922.019 think it is
923.279 this is now opinion again and not
925.44 science I think it is the number one
927.6 endocrinopathy
929.579 that is iatrogenic for women uh we will
933.36 definitely talk about it I get a lot of
934.86 questions about oral contraceptives
936.779 um in the social media space and also
940.139 questions about iuds quite a lot totally
943.62 in particular copper iuds
945.56 non-non-hormonal IUD so we will
947.579 definitely touch on that I'm an IUD
949.56 Crusader so I just want to you know give
952.139 you that warning you're you're a fan do
954.12 I have that right or you're anti I am a
956.1 huge fan which iuds in particular so I
959.639 like copper because it's non-hormonal
963.42 it's as effective as getting your tubes
965.88 dyed who would have thought right I mean
967.74 it's that toxic to the sperm Mobility is
969.72 that how it works that's my
971.399 understanding of it is that that it that
972.899 it basically it's like a
975.139 more or less an electric fence to the
977.519 the sperm cap and just that's it
979.199 electric fence is a bit of a harsh
981.779 analogy but I'll work with that
984.12 but it's
986.699 it's for 10 years so that you really
988.68 have
989.94 complete autonomy and sovereignty over
992.699 your sexual life
994.38 that's profound and to not get all those
997.019 Downstream risks they're associated with
998.88 a birth control pill the other thing
1000.259 that's important to know about it I know
1001.639 this is a sidebar
1003.5 women who use the copper IUD
1006.56 have the highest satisfaction rate of
1009.56 anyone on contraceptives the highest
1013.04 satisfaction rate and yet it is the
1016.82 least used of all forms of contraception
1019.519 now my favorite is vasectomy
1022.639 but short of vasectomy I think the IED
1025.579 is a really great choice there are some
1027.199 risks associated with it I'm not saying
1028.64 it's risk-free but I love IUD and I love
1032.419 it for younger women too because it used
1034.64 to be that when I went through my
1036.26 training which was 30 years ago we were
1039.62 told you know don't put it in someone
1041.179 who hasn't had a baby
1043.04 and that is patriarchal messaging
1045.799 but getting back to your original
1046.88 question which is about biomarkers per
1049.4 decade
1051.799 in your 20s
1053.9 that's when you want to do some base
1056.0 casing with estrogen progesterone and
1058.76 testosterone
1060.08 so I think it's really helpful to know
1062.12 about this this Tango you're from
1065.12 Argentina or your father I have
1066.919 Argentine lineage yes my grandparents
1069.32 did Tango into their late 80s I I am I'm
1073.7 in my late 40s and I I still haven't
1075.559 started so I suppose there's time it
1077.6 might be time for you to okay and it
1080.9 might be a factor in their longevity did
1083.539 they have good health span and my
1086.179 grandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily
1088.299 remained mentally sharp until he died in
1090.62 his late 90s but um almost burned down
1093.14 their apartment several times falling
1094.4 asleep with a cigarette in his mouth so
1095.78 I don't recommend anyone Smoke by the
1097.58 way uh but it was uh coffee mate uh red
1100.46 meat and cigarettes and they lived into
1101.84 their 90s so that side of my family has
1104.12 the genetic Advantage the other side
1106.34 less so
1107.539 um but in any event uh Tango
1110.24 um is a 2023 goal it has been every year
1113.9 um the uh I'm gonna hold you accountable
1116.96 today okay we'll do and there no there
1118.76 will be no YouTube video of me do at
1121.52 least not initially Tim Ferriss actually
1123.5 a phenomenal podcaster as we know is uh
1125.9 he's a badass he's a badass Tango Tango
1128.66 dancer I know this through various
1130.22 sources yes yeah I've seen yeah so this
1133.28 Tango between us and progesterone is
1135.2 incredibly important you want to have
1137.36 the right lead do you want to have the
1139.16 right follow between the two hormones
1141.74 again I'm stepping away from my science
1143.48 hat but what happens a lot of the time
1146.72 is that estrogen dominates in that Tango
1149.9 and when that happens it sets you up for
1153.14 greater risk of fibroids endometriosis
1156.46 breast pain
1159.08 probably in association with the
1162.5 microbiome and the estrobolume can you
1165.559 familiarize me with the estrobloom yeah
1167.419 I'm delighted to know that I don't
1169.58 recognize the term yeah so the
1171.799 estrobolume is the set of microbes
1175.22 in and their DNA their DNA mostly
1178.46 in the gut microbiome that set of
1181.46 microbes in their DNA so it's in the
1184.94 if you look at the totality
1187.64 the subset
1189.26 of particular bacteria modulate estrogen
1193.7 levels
1195.02 so a lot of this work was spearheaded by
1197.12 Martin Glaser
1199.34 and
1200.78 what we know is that there are some
1202.82 women who have an estrobolume that makes
1206.96 them have a greater risk of certain
1209.559 estrogen mediated
1211.88 conditions like breast cancer
1213.64 endometrial cancer
1215.84 and a men prostate cancer
1218.299 so the estrobulum is incredibly
1219.86 important there's not a lot of attention
1221.84 paid to it but I always think in terms
1225.02 of my patients you know could this be
1227.36 someone who's got a faulty a strobe and
1230.84 we need to adjust it with you know some
1234.559 of the microbiome
1236.86 modulating
1238.4 uh nutrients nutraceuticals that we have
1240.919 so that they're less likely to have that
1243.679 that Tango that's not working with
1245.419 estrogen progesterone so getting back to
1247.64 the biomarkers
1250.76 if if you gave me an unlimited budget
1253.76 which I kind of have with some of my
1256.58 um clients that I work with now
1258.799 what I would want to know is
1261.44 estrogen progesterone testosterone and I
1264.32 want the timing right for that
1266.419 I'd want to know about DHEA and sort of
1268.7 the whole Anderson pathway I'd want to
1271.16 know about the metabolites of estrogen
1272.84 because some of them are protective and
1276.86 very helpful others are a bit like
1280.34 Homer Simpson I mean they're just like
1282.44 causing all kinds of problems in your
1284.419 body increasing the risk of Quinones
1287.6 like DNA damage and potentially an
1291.74 increased risk of breast cancer although
1293.6 that data I think is mixed
1296.96 I'd also like to know about their stool
1298.94 so I want to know about the microbiome
1301.22 so the best that we have right now is to
1303.14 look uh when we do stool testing I do a
1306.02 lot of stool testing we can look at
1307.94 things like beta glucoronidase
1310.88 are you familiar with BG I'm familiar
1313.34 with it as a term and so for those
1315.2 listening it very often not always when
1317.78 you hear an ace ASE you're dealing with
1319.46 an enzyme so we can take a stab there
1322.159 and and it sounds like it's somehow
1324.26 involved in
1325.58 um glucose metabolism of some sort or is
1328.58 it clickeronautation so it's involved in
1331.64 when you produce estrogen in the body
1334.7 this is like the simplified version but
1336.919 when you produce estrogen you are meant
1340.22 to use it like send it to The receptors
1343.4 where it's meant to go and then lose it
1345.74 like you don't want to keep
1347.0 recirculating the estrogen like Bad
1348.86 Karma and that's what happens with
1351.2 people who have high blade beta
1353.78 gluconidase so it's this enzyme that's
1356.299 produced by three bacteria in particular
1358.28 in the gut and I see a lot of men and
1361.1 women who have elevated beta
1363.919 glucuronidase and then they have some
1366.08 estrogen dominance related to that is
1368.299 that the total reason we don't really
1370.159 know but it's one of the drivers it's
1372.38 one of the levers and it can be detected
1374.24 from a microbiome AKA stool sample
1376.82 that's right and in terms of blood
1379.22 testing or various tests for these other
1381.559 biomarkers getting estrogen testosterone
1384.08 and other ratios I realize there are
1386.48 people have different means financial
1388.46 means but in general people wanting to
1391.58 do a blood test it sounds like they're
1392.84 going to need to do it what women will
1394.34 need to do it at different stages of
1395.6 their menstrual cycle if they had to
1396.98 pick one
1398.179 you know either in the follicular phase
1401.179 and or in the luteal stage of their
1404.179 ovarian menstrual cycle excuse me
1405.799 ovulatory menstrual cycle
1407.539 when would you suggest they do that if
1409.64 they had to pick one so if you forced me
1412.22 to pick one I would say
1414.32 probably day 21 to 22 for someone in her
1418.7 20s so we're focused right now in that
1421.28 decade
1422.24 so for most women they've got a
1424.039 menstrual cycle Dave that averages out
1426.2 at 28 days so this is about a week
1428.36 before they start their period
1431.36 for women or more irregular it's harder
1433.58 to do that as women get older and we'll
1436.159 talk about this in a moment
1437.84 usually the cycle gets a little shorter
1439.94 so as they start to decline in their
1442.7 progesterone production their period
1444.62 gets a little closer together like mine
1446.539 before August was about every 26 days
1449.9 so
1451.88 at that point you want to test sooner
1454.1 like day 1920 and I'm not talking about
1456.919 blood tests so a blood test is the
1458.6 cheapest thing it's usually what's
1459.62 covered by insurance but my preference
1462.2 would be to do dried urine
1464.48 I like to use saliva for cortisol I like
1467.48 to use dried urine so that I get
1469.039 metabolomics in addition to the levels
1471.14 of these hormones and if I'm forced to
1473.78 I'll use blood testing and that's
1475.64 certainly the gold standard
1477.5 for all of these hormones that we're
1479.36 talking about
1481.1 but
1482.36 um it's not as comprehensive and as you
1484.46 know it's a quick little snapshot while
1486.14 the needle's in your vein for you know
1488.0 30 seconds yeah the salivary cortisol
1490.64 makes sense to me because my
1491.659 understanding is that you get free
1492.679 cortisol which is the active cortisol
1494.419 you said with urine you're also getting
1495.86 the metabolites that's right and then
1498.62 um for blood testing you're getting it
1500.9 it's sort of a crude window into the
1502.52 averages ecstatic total level
1506.78 so uh let me go back and say one other
1509.96 thing about biomarkers a big part of the
1512.12 testing that I do in phenotyping my
1514.28 patients I practice Precision medicine
1516.44 so I I like to
1519.4 almost start with nutritional testing
1524.36 I don't think I've ever had a teenager
1526.76 I've got some NBA players that are 19 20
1529.34 21 so maybe those count
1531.86 but uh those are men obviously but for
1535.64 nutritional testing
1537.98 that would be a potentially a helpful
1539.84 thing to do in your 20s becomes less
1542.179 important as you get older and you
1543.559 develop more micronutrient deficiencies
1545.539 but micronutrients play a huge role in
1548.96 terms of hormone production magnesium
1551.179 you know the Magnesium is hugely
1553.4 involved in the way that you get rid of
1555.26 estrogen as an example
1557.24 so micronutrient testing what I usually
1559.22 do is a combination of blood and urine
1562.159 and so I'm looking at all of the
1563.96 micronutrients that we can measure that
1566.6 have some clinical scientific basis
1569.9 behind them
1571.76 if I could do that for a teenager I
1574.4 think it might be helpful because
1577.34 I recently gave a lecture on breast
1579.44 cancer risk reduction
1581.659 another quick sidebar
1583.94 and I was sad to find that
1588.919 intake of vegetables polyphenols is such
1592.94 an important predictor a future risk of
1595.46 breast cancer like when you're a 50 60
1597.38 plus and the most important time is when
1600.62 you're a teenager
1602.12 now I have one daughter that eats
1603.799 vegetables she loves them and I have
1605.6 another daughter who eats food that's
1607.159 beige and it's very hard to get her to
1610.58 eat the volume of vegetables you know
1612.74 five colors a day which is what I do
1615.38 and
1617.419 if you have evidence that you could show
1620.72 a 17 year old that they've got
1623.24 micronutrient gaps
1626.96 I think that would be a motivator for
1628.88 them to eat differently at a time when
1631.22 it's so critical
1633.02 even though it's you know 25 years in
1635.299 the future that it's going to
1636.32 potentially change this Arc that they're
1638.24 on
1639.14 what do you do for a young woman who
1641.72 doesn't like vegetables is or is not
1644.779 somehow able or willing to to get those
1647.6 five colors a day of vegetable to help
1650.779 support the microbiome
1652.94 you know our supplements a useful tool
1655.88 in that case
1657.08 um what other sorts of tools Behavioral
1658.82 or otherwise are useful such a good
1661.22 question so here I'm going to invoke Rob
1663.14 Knight at UCSD
1665.24 so I think his his uh his gut project
1669.14 has really been helpful in terms of
1671.24 understanding what kind of modulators
1673.159 are going to be important
1675.44 so what I try to get that person to do
1677.659 and I don't see many teens anymore other
1679.94 than NBA players
1681.74 what I try to get them to do is to have
1683.299 a smoothie
1684.98 very hard to get them to have a smoothie
1686.659 every day but if I could get them to
1688.1 have a smoothie three times a week and
1690.38 to throw some of these vegetables in
1692.0 that makes a huge difference I mean we
1694.34 know that makes a difference in terms of
1695.84 microbiome change she should be blending
1698.179 up broccoli or kale cauliflower so
1700.76 cauliflower is great even they're
1702.559 putting things into the Smoothie yeah I
1704.6 don't know if you can get a teenager to
1705.86 do that but they often will use like I
1707.96 have them do steamed broccoli that's in
1710.0 the freezer because it's got very little
1711.5 taste
1712.76 so that they could do that in a
1714.679 chocolate smoothie they could add some
1716.299 greens I like greens powders are super
1719.6 convenient so that with you know kind of
1722.48 a taste that they like whether that's
1724.34 chocolate which is what most my clients
1726.679 want or you know vanilla with berries
1729.559 and that sort of thing so that can go a
1731.539 long way if you don't like vegetables
1733.34 and short of that I would say some
1735.559 supplements but I would say that's a
1737.179 distant second to making a smoothie I've
1739.64 got one patient that I have to mention
1741.919 because
1743.84 um
1745.34 he took us to the extreme so he is a
1748.88 retired physicist professor at UCSD he
1752.659 found out that his microbiome was a hot
1754.4 mess
1755.24 and developed autoimmune disease and so
1759.38 he became hell-bent like only a
1761.899 physicist could on changing his
1764.179 microbiome and he dramatically shifted
1767.12 it by having a smoothie every day with
1771.38 57 vegetables and fruits in it 57
1775.52 independent 57 independent so
1779.299 I mean this just warms my heart the way
1783.08 that he did this but he would go to the
1785.059 farmer's market he would just get a
1786.919 bunch of this a bunch of that
1788.779 and he would go home make the smoothie
1791.12 and then stick it in the freezer so he'd
1793.159 have a serving every day and he became a
1796.7 completely different person based on
1799.159 this microbiome change his
1801.919 uh autoimmune disease is in remission
1806.12 he um
1808.039 he dropped a huge amount of weight he
1811.159 went from being you know kind of this
1812.6 phenotype that I know you know well of a
1815.96 professor High performing traveling
1817.64 around the world on so many boards so
1820.22 much Innovation so many great ideas
1821.96 super computer guy to being someone who
1825.38 gets up in the morning gets in his hot
1827.0 tub exercises for like one to two hours
1830.0 a day
1830.899 and then does a little work like he
1833.48 completely shifted the way that he lives
1835.34 and his microbiome shift you know who
1837.98 knows what what's the chicken and what
1839.539 the what's the egg there but he had a
1841.46 huge change in his physiology glucose
1844.34 went from being quite high he had
1846.86 and he tracks all of this of course it's
1848.96 like
1849.94 Jupiter after all right and retired I
1853.039 suppose might have had and he's retired
1854.6 but he is he's got the longest time
1857.179 series of anyone I know
1859.82 and he's tracked his glucose and Insulin
1862.1 going back 20 years
1863.96 so he can show you okay here's where I
1867.02 started having my smoothie
1868.82 and here's how my glucose and Insulin
1871.159 changed as a result of that I'd like to
1873.38 take a quick break and acknowledge one
1875.299 of our sponsors athletic greens athletic
1877.82 greens now called ag1 is a vitamin
1880.58 mineral probiotic drink that covers all
1882.919 of your foundational nutritional needs
1884.6 I've been taking athletic greens since
1886.58 2012 so I'm delighted that they're
1888.74 sponsoring the podcast the reason I
1890.419 started taking athletic greens and the
1891.86 reason I still take athletic greens once
1894.14 are usually twice a day is that it gets
1896.6 to be the probiotics that I need for gut
1898.58 health our gut is very important it's
1900.5 populated by gut microbiota that
1903.08 communicate with the brain the immune
1904.46 system and basically all the biological
1906.2 systems of our body to strongly impact
1908.179 our immediate and long-term health
1910.52 and those probiotics and athletic greens
1912.74 are optimal and vital for microbiotic
1915.679 health in addition athletic greens
1917.72 contains a number of adaptogens vitamins
1919.46 and minerals that make sure that all of
1921.08 my foundational nutritional needs are
1922.76 met and it tastes great if you'd like to
1925.76 try athletic greens you can go to
1927.46 athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll
1930.559 give you five free travel packs that
1932.24 make it really easy to mix up athletic
1933.86 greens while you're on the road in the
1935.48 car on the plane Etc and they'll give
1937.52 you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2
1940.1 again that's athleticgreens.com huberman
1942.74 to get the five free travel packs and
1944.6 the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 is
1947.779 there a case for I'll say young women
1950.059 but young women and men using
1952.94 over-the-counter probiotics as a way to
1955.279 enhance the microbiome this is something
1956.539 I hear about a lot I've heard that
1957.919 excessive doses of capsule probiotics
1959.96 can give a brain fog like condition
1962.86 I personally don't use capsule
1965.059 probiotics unless I feel like my system
1967.22 is under a significant amount of stress
1969.08 in which case I might add that in for
1970.52 brief periods of time or if I've just
1972.26 taken antibiotics for a period of time
1974.559 do you ever recommend that the college
1977.059 student or the high school student that
1979.52 she or he take capsule probiotics
1982.12 assuming that they're getting let's say
1984.62 three to five servings of vegetables per
1986.84 day either in smoothie form or some
1988.94 other form what are your thoughts on on
1991.52 supplementing probiotics
1993.799 it sounds like such a simple question it
1996.74 is such a complex answer and I don't
1998.899 think we really have the answer so I'll
2001.12 tell you the way that I approach it
2002.919 I look for randomized trials to support
2005.019 my use of probiotics and frankly I'm
2008.14 underwhelmed
2009.519 so I've seen some data
2011.559 if I invoke my
2013.659 um NBA players for a moment
2016.6 almost every player I've tested has
2018.82 increased intestinal permeability they
2020.62 just have such a high training load
2022.299 probably mediated by cortisol very high
2025.36 glucosis when they drain that they have
2028.179 increased intestinal permeability so
2030.279 those tight junctions in their intestine
2032.74 become loose they develop a lot of
2034.96 inflammation as a result of that and
2036.94 when you're a professional MBA player
2038.74 and you're making 20 million a year
2041.38 like you don't want a lot of
2042.7 inflammation you want a little bit to
2044.38 like help your muscles recover but you
2046.12 don't want it to be
2048.399 um adding to problems when you develop
2050.139 an injury so this is leaky gut leaky gut
2052.899 yeah I don't love that term but yeah
2055.419 we'll use it here so there's a there's a
2058.359 particular
2059.56 probiotic that is helpful in athletes
2062.44 with leaky gut so that's the kind of
2064.419 specificity and randomized trial that
2066.46 I'm looking for
2067.899 the rest of it
2071.26 I think there's support if you find help
2073.599 from it as you described if you take a
2076.599 course of antibiotics I mean first of
2078.22 all I would question whether you need
2079.48 them but I try and avoid them there have
2082.06 been instances where they've been
2083.32 prescribed and I took them mostly in the
2084.76 past I was in college they seem like
2086.2 they kind of gave them out you had a
2087.339 sinus infection to give you Pro you know
2088.839 antibiotics using like yeah the worst
2091.119 treatment ever yeah so if you're coming
2093.82 off of antibiotics I think that's a good
2095.5 time to do what we call replacement dose
2097.54 probiotics I think what's far more
2099.94 interesting is
2102.48 prebiotics I think the data is much
2105.4 better for prebiotics and
2108.58 um a selective use of polyphenols
2112.78 how would a person in their teens and
2115.18 20s or any age for that matter know
2118.54 what whether or not they have
2119.74 nutritional deficiencies what is the
2121.42 best way to analyze if one is getting
2123.339 enough magnesium and for that matter
2125.859 what is going to be the best way to test
2127.599 the microbiome you said stool sample and
2131.079 I'll come right back with the same
2132.64 question I asked about a blood test
2135.4 what time of day when during the month
2139.0 um to establish a baseline so this would
2141.52 be prior to embarking on a you know 97
2143.98 vegetables or how many years per day 57.
2147.28 well I love the idea that you're telling
2149.56 us if I'm gathering correctly is that
2151.54 yes there's a case for probiotics but
2153.04 for the typical person regardless of age
2154.72 eating more vegetables or drinking more
2157.359 vegetables as the case may be is going
2159.52 to be beneficial for the gut microbiome
2161.22 perhaps without the need to go test
2163.3 whether or not one is making a certain
2165.339 number of estrogen related metabolites
2167.2 or not just that that's a great starting
2168.7 Place eat or consume more vegetables
2172.18 um but if one wants to analyze their gut
2174.46 microbiome are there good tests
2176.079 available to the general public this has
2177.76 been I'm not going to name companies but
2179.2 I've been tracking this over the years
2180.82 and it's never been clear to me that we
2182.44 know what constituents of the gut
2184.839 microbiome are are best we know that
2187.3 dysbiosis is bad yeah and we know that
2189.82 diversity of the microbiome is good we
2191.8 hear this yeah but no one's ever told me
2193.48 that you want a particular ratio of one
2197.079 microbiota to another right in a way
2199.359 that has made any sense to me at least
2200.98 totally I'm not a microbiologist but
2203.5 whereas with you know with testosterone
2206.26 in men we hear okay you want your free
2207.82 testosterone to be about two percent of
2209.32 your total perhaps with women you women
2212.26 are gonna have more testosterone than
2213.4 estrogen on average but still less than
2215.38 men when you look at testosterone etc
2217.96 etc but you can kind of get some some
2219.64 crude measures but for the microbiome it
2221.38 just seems like long lists of microbiota
2223.54 for which I just get dizzy I just if you
2226.3 just wrote out a bunch of I's and L's
2227.8 and s's you'd you can go halfway a bit
2231.16 bit the same information I'm not trying
2233.079 to poke at that field it's a beautiful
2234.4 field but they haven't told me what to
2236.5 what I what my microbiota ought to look
2239.68 like like what's a healthy microbiome
2241.359 chart well that's because we don't know
2244.48 I mean the best we have is Rob Knight's
2246.52 work but even that is limited in terms
2249.88 of you know can I tell you that a a
2252.46 woman in her 20s should have this
2254.32 particular pattern with her microbiome
2256.66 no I can't so
2259.42 um let me go to your first question
2260.619 because I think you just asked about six
2263.32 your first question is about nutritional
2265.24 testing
2266.26 what I like to do with nutritional
2268.359 testing is run a panel that's looking at
2273.839 antioxidants so like vitamin A vitamin C
2276.64 alpha lipoic acid
2279.579 um plant-based antioxidants because you
2281.2 can measure that in the blood
2282.82 I like to look at some of the key
2285.72 vitamins especially the B vitamin range
2288.82 because as you probably know if you've
2290.92 got a particular genetic
2293.8 um polymorphism so you might be less
2295.66 likely to be absorbing the right level
2297.82 of vitamin B9 folate vitamin B12 Etc
2302.26 I'm also looking going back to the
2304.119 antioxidants at glutathione because I
2306.04 think that's such an important lever
2307.48 when it comes to detoxification which we
2309.94 haven't talked about yet
2311.38 and then I'm looking at some of the
2312.94 Minerals Magnesium is really the most
2314.8 important and we know that somewhere
2316.3 around 788 of Americans are deficient in
2318.88 magnesium that's like the the lowest
2320.98 hanging fruit I would be curious for
2322.78 instance like with magnesium if that
2324.76 number of people are deficient does that
2326.92 mean that that number of people should
2328.24 be targeting their nutrition towards
2330.22 foods that contain magnesium and or
2331.839 supplementing with magnesium and if so
2333.88 what forms of magnesium we've talked
2336.22 about mag three and eight for Sleep
2338.079 there's a Mexican there's so many forms
2340.119 it can be a little bit overwhelming to
2341.56 people so any any detail in sourcing
2344.079 would appreciate it great so first in
2346.72 terms of testing what I prefer to do
2350.079 is to mention one more than one lab and
2352.72 more than one brand
2354.82 um and I can just I'm speaking mostly
2356.859 from experience so uh for testing I do a
2361.0 lot of Genova neutrals
2364.18 during the pandemic they developed an
2367.24 at-home test normally with a neutral
2369.16 valve you have to get your blood drawn
2370.359 and you have to do a urine sample
2372.46 so a lot of people can't do that the
2374.44 great thing about this test is your
2376.359 insurance usually pays for most of it
2378.52 and so the copay is about 150 dollars
2382.24 so during the pandemic they developed
2384.04 another test called metabolomics which
2386.5 does much of the same testing but it's a
2389.2 finger prick
2390.76 so most of my patients prefer that in
2393.339 fact they haven't gone back to the
2394.48 nutribal
2395.92 second lab is spectracell
2398.98 I use Spectra cell occasionally I find
2401.44 it not quite as easy in terms of fitting
2403.78 into my practice but I've got friends
2406.3 and mentors like Mark Houston who does a
2409.66 lot of
2411.04 kind of Precision
2413.64 cardiometabolic Health he thinks
2416.079 spectrosol is the best test out there so
2419.14 you asked about magnesium
2421.119 you have to measure red blood cell
2422.74 magnesium like whole blood
2425.26 and with deficiency it's interesting
2428.74 with
2429.88 supplementation
2431.56 for my patients who tend toward
2433.42 constipation
2434.859 and that's frankly about 80 percent of
2436.78 the women that I take care of really yes
2439.359 wow I'd be curious as to why that that
2442.0 is
2442.839 um is it I I can guess diet stress
2447.339 um patriarchy
2449.14 rage
2450.82 to psychosis so Pine the um the pine
2455.02 system right
2456.48 psychology Immunology neural and
2459.52 endocrine factors combined is that yes
2461.859 and then I would say there's another
2463.24 Factor
2464.8 which is
2468.52 being female is a health hazard
2471.94 so we have twice the rate of depression
2474.76 insomnia
2476.44 we've got three to four x increased risk
2479.32 of multiple sclerosis
2481.06 we've got five to eight times the risk
2483.579 of thyroid dysfunction
2486.22 so if you just look at that and you look
2488.2 at subtle pre-clinical thyroid
2490.78 dysfunction
2491.859 a huge number of the women that I take
2494.02 care of well let me back off
2495.82 a large number of the women that I take
2497.68 care of have thyroid dysfunction that's
2500.32 contributing to constipation and if we
2503.32 go back to that control system the
2504.82 hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid
2506.619 Canal gut axis
2508.9 and they have a lot of perceived stress
2511.9 together with this borderline thyroid
2514.06 function that no mainstream medicine
2516.22 doctor has told her is a problem and
2518.8 then she's got a problem with the Tango
2520.48 between estrogen and progesterone
2524.26 she's going to tend toward constipation
2526.06 women have a lot more constipation than
2527.74 men
2528.579 the gut is about 10 feet longer in women
2531.099 compared to men
2532.72 we should talk about some sex and gender
2534.579 differences and Define those sure and
2536.92 they are much more likely to have a
2538.48 torturous colon
2541.0 and the way you know that is you get a
2542.8 colonoscopy and they tell you
2545.079 yeah it's really hard to like get in
2547.18 there and do what we need to do as a
2549.4 brief tangent but I think this is the
2550.9 time to ask
2551.98 um at what age now do Physicians insist
2556.0 their female patients get colonoscopies
2558.76 for men I think the age used to be 50
2561.099 now it's getting ratcheted back to 45 or
2564.099 40. again these are recommendations not
2566.32 requirements but they're pretty strong
2567.7 recommendations from depending on where
2569.68 you live Etc
2571.66 um for women how early do you think they
2573.76 should get a colonoscopy to to explore
2575.92 for possible polyps and or colon cancer
2579.4 yeah it's a really good question I don't
2581.26 know the answer so what I've always
2582.94 operated with is 50. the way that I
2585.579 answer that is to go to the U.S
2587.5 preventive task force rating to
2589.78 determine based on their synthesis of
2592.119 the data what age is the most
2593.859 appropriate has it changed as you just
2596.079 described for men from 50 to younger I
2599.14 don't know so we should fact check that
2601.359 all these um additional health hazards
2604.66 for women
2606.339 um you mentioned some of the
2608.2 you broadly mentioned psychological
2610.3 impact right and of course these things
2612.28 are all related psychology immunology
2614.5 and one of the I think wonderful things
2616.119 about
2617.5 neuroscience and Science in general and
2619.839 medicine is that there's now an
2621.7 understanding that all the organs are
2623.2 connected to one another it's a network
2625.06 it's a network and that the microbiome
2627.099 sits at had um at a key node within that
2630.339 Network
2631.9 um and I think most people accept that
2633.7 now yes yeah that seems to be a theme
2636.16 that at least in the last 10 years is
2637.78 really wonderful because
2639.64 um certainly for Neuroscience it was
2640.96 thought that you know unless it's in the
2642.4 cranial vault
2643.72 it's not neural which is ridiculous
2645.88 because there's lots of nervous system
2647.02 outside the skull but in any case can I
2650.38 interrupt for a second yes please so I
2652.0 think you're right that there's an
2653.619 understanding about the network effect
2656.26 but I think that
2658.359 as much as I love mainstream medicine
2661.119 and I trained in it and I'm so grateful
2664.0 for my education I still think it is a
2666.76 silo based way of taking care of
2668.5 patients so even if there's an
2670.24 understanding of the network effect more
2671.92 at the science level or as you described
2674.44 in Neuroscience there's still you know
2677.619 if you are a woman who has constipation
2680.98 fatigue
2683.26 um
2684.099 maybe an autoimmune condition
2686.88 feel stressed out all the time feel like
2689.859 your hormones are out of whack you get
2691.72 sent to the gastroenterologist for the
2694.359 constipation you get sent to the
2697.0 rheumatologist for your autoimmune
2698.859 issues you maybe get sent to an
2701.14 endocrinologist if you've got thyroid
2703.599 problems and there's very little
2705.78 collaboration between these groups so
2709.18 even though there's an understanding of
2710.92 the network effect
2712.839 in real life it's not happening
2716.28 let's um let's go deeper down that path
2719.92 because I you point out something really
2721.3 important and you've mentioned
2722.619 constipation a few times can we view
2725.2 constipation as a serious enough symptom
2727.24 that it warrants an immediate
2728.74 intervention that is does it flag or
2730.96 signal
2732.52 problems that are severe enough that
2734.079 that should be the issue that's dealt
2735.64 with uh for anybody that's experiencing
2738.04 it yeah and I mean sort of an odd topic
2740.079 for many people because they think oh
2741.099 you know bowel movements and sort of you
2742.96 know there's that kind of um
2744.099 pre-adolescent humor around this but I
2745.96 think it's it's so important when you're
2747.28 what I'm hearing you say is that
2748.72 constipation is far more common in women
2751.24 and it signals a general many problems
2754.359 occurring does that mean that women
2756.94 should address constipation and if so
2759.099 what's the best way to address
2760.3 constipation yeah I love this question
2762.7 because
2763.9 you're doing can we have a quick little
2766.48 meta conversation so you're doing
2768.28 something that I knew you would do which
2770.68 is
2771.64 you're teaching me something and you're
2773.68 changing like there's a social genomics
2775.54 thing happening where you're changing my
2777.22 thought about this so I just wanted to
2779.079 acknowledge that thank you thank you
2780.4 well I think for me you know when I hear
2782.68 that there's a kind of you know you're
2784.18 talking about a phenotype constipation
2785.8 is a phenotype it's one that people
2787.599 generally don't wear a t-shirt
2788.92 explaining it to people but that I'm
2790.839 guessing anything to do with sexual
2792.76 health
2793.54 um bowel Health Urology people just
2796.78 don't talk about right
2798.7 um for all sorts of reasons and those
2800.619 reasons are probably so obvious that
2802.3 they're not even worth discussing but
2803.74 because and also because we won't change
2805.24 them except by talking about them yep so
2808.0 if you say
2809.68 um women are far more constipated and
2811.96 that's signaling a larger set of
2813.579 problems yes then my immediate thought
2815.56 is well will relieving constipation
2819.099 um pun uh intended retroactively
2822.64 um will that assist in a great number of
2826.839 issues and or will it get them down the
2828.88 road of thinking about those other
2830.14 issues more specifically like do I need
2831.76 more magnesium or should I be putting
2833.44 vegetables in my smoothie you know so
2835.24 I'm curious about constipation as a
2837.339 Target yeah for intervention that then
2839.74 opens up a bunch of other discussions
2841.54 because there are these certain nodes in
2843.099 the in the mental health physical health
2845.02 space that when someone you know like we
2847.66 talk a lot of deliberate cold exposure
2849.4 do I think it's magic no but I think
2851.02 that if someone's getting themselves
2852.099 into a cold shower once a day it opens
2854.26 up a nun a number of questions about
2855.94 themselves and reveals a number of
2857.38 things to themselves like how do I
2859.0 buffer stress yeah what sorts of levels
2861.339 of control do I actually have and on and
2863.079 on so perhaps not the best example but
2865.66 some of us hate cold exposure right
2868.18 which is we have we have like a gene
2870.099 that makes us stress out like you
2872.079 wouldn't believe which I would argue
2874.18 makes it
2875.26 um very likely that even 10 seconds of
2877.54 cold exposure gets you the effect that
2879.339 you want as opposed to someone who
2880.78 adores cold exposure like a penguin
2882.46 needs a lot more cold exposure for it to
2884.38 have the the Adaptive response anyway
2886.119 that's my way of gumbing through that uh
2889.359 quite uh you're you're quite correct
2892.119 um so so let's answer those questions
2894.22 constipation issue yeah so this is how
2896.8 you're changing the way I think about
2898.3 this
2899.2 so you're asking okay instead of looking
2901.48 at constipation as a constellation of
2903.88 symptoms what about if you just used it
2905.92 on its own as sort of a
2908.859 um
2909.88 a key
2912.04 indicator or signal
2914.5 of dysfunction with my network or maybe
2917.2 something broader
2918.7 and I think that's right
2921.4 so it makes me think of a few things it
2923.619 makes me you're also changing this book
2925.54 that I'm writing on autoimmunity and
2927.46 Trauma so thank you for that so
2931.3 women experience more trauma than men
2933.22 this is well established if you look at
2935.26 the ace studies that were done by the
2937.54 CDC in Kaiser in 1998 we know that men
2941.5 for the most part middle-aged men have
2943.24 about
2944.8 um
2945.819 about 50 of them experience significant
2949.119 trauma as defined by the ace
2950.859 questionnaire women are at 60 and that's
2953.74 pretty durable since 1998. so women have
2956.859 more they have different forms of abuse
2960.04 much more likely to have sexual abuse
2963.099 they have a different HPA response than
2966.7 men
2968.2 their perceived stress tends to be
2970.599 higher and I'm generalizing for a
2972.28 population
2974.44 side note you know in Precision medicine
2976.24 we don't do that we do medicine for the
2977.98 individual individual not the population
2979.599 not medicine for the average
2982.3 and so if you look at
2984.88 the physiology of a female
2987.579 I think that constipation and that need
2991.06 to like control and restrain and hold
2993.76 things in
2995.56 you know tighten the anal sphincter
2997.9 I think that's part of the physiology
3000.3 so I'm veering away from the science but
3002.46 I do think that it is a really important
3005.28 signal to pay a lot of attention to now
3008.579 you also asked about microbiome testing
3010.68 should we do that or do yeah well I have
3012.839 a couple more questions about
3013.56 constipation I never thought I'd ask
3015.18 this many questions about concentrating
3016.38 but now I'm fascinated by the way also
3018.24 this morning I taught medical students
3019.5 at Stanford about the fact that we are
3020.76 basically a series of tubes so you
3022.319 talked about the the anal sphincter we
3023.94 are a set of sphincters from one end to
3025.68 the other I mean we are a set of tubes a
3027.599 nervous system being one of those tubes
3029.16 and well and I think in eastern medicine
3031.02 they talk about the various locks
3032.52 between those tubes and Chambers and
3034.14 it's not without coincidence there's
3036.18 some real wisdom there of course wait
3038.099 did you just talk about energetic
3040.2 Anatomy uh more or less I didn't say the
3042.119 word chakras but uh but I might in
3044.4 passage it's the bondas right are the
3047.22 are the are the the sphincters yes yes
3049.8 that's right uh thank you for for that
3051.839 the um so what defines constipation I
3055.38 mean in other words let's think about
3056.7 the healthy rather than thinking about
3057.9 the unhealthy let's how many bowel
3060.18 movements should a woman or a man have
3064.2 per day assuming this is where it gets
3067.02 tricky because some people are doing
3068.16 time restricted feeding some people are
3069.599 eating more some people eat more fiber
3071.04 more bulk larger meal at the end of the
3072.359 day a larger meal the beginning of the
3073.44 day we will never
3075.18 um be able to sort out all those
3076.5 variables but on average
3079.92 um how many bowel movements and his
3081.72 timing
3082.859 during the day for bowel movements at
3084.839 all informative what works for you
3088.26 um well when I'm asleep
3090.059 um generally I don't want a bowel
3091.319 movement so I'm going to be like most
3092.64 people right well sleep is primary for
3094.38 you right exactly um I always assumed
3096.839 that morning time yeah was a was a
3099.96 healthy time for bowel movements um and
3103.5 I think almost everybody babies included
3106.94 recognize the feeling of being lighter
3109.859 and more energetic when they've
3112.44 evacuated totally colon totally um in
3114.839 fact so much so that I'm obsessed with
3116.579 jungian and Freudian psychology that the
3119.04 first thing we learn when we come into
3120.119 this world right is that we want
3121.5 something we we feel some sort of
3124.319 autonomic arousal stress whether or not
3126.599 it's food or warmth or the need to have
3129.059 a bowel movement one of the first things
3130.26 that parents learn is how to recognize
3132.059 that not by the odor coming from the
3134.52 diaper but by the look on the baby's
3136.5 face or their agitation agitation
3138.359 signals the need for some sort of relief
3140.7 right temperature relief food relief
3143.819 um evacuating the bowel relief so my
3146.22 understanding is that as autonomic
3147.78 arousal increases in the early part of
3149.579 the day ideally after a good night's
3151.26 sleep that bowel movements become more
3153.059 likely unless that arousal becomes so
3154.92 great that then people feel so quote
3157.02 unquote locked up right
3158.819 um because of the balance of the
3160.14 autonomics of features so early day I'm
3163.68 guessing and again in the second half of
3165.359 the day and here I'm totally guessing
3167.7 um and certainly not having to wake in
3169.14 the middle of the night
3171.059 um yeah those are my best guesses
3173.52 that's great so I would agree with that
3176.099 when I was at Harvard Medical School in
3178.8 UCSF for residency I was taught that
3180.96 constipation is having a bowel movement
3183.48 less frequently than whenever once every
3186.24 three days
3188.04 so I don't think I've ever laughed out
3190.02 loud on this podcast as a consequence of
3192.18 of uh textbook medical knowledge are you
3194.52 kidding me is that ridiculous well that
3196.38 sounds like and and here pun intended
3198.0 that sounds like the uh the conclusion
3200.64 of some very um constipated personally
3203.4 and and and and in other ways
3205.92 constipated individuals and again this
3208.5 might seem like an odd conversation but
3210.059 the the discussion around conservation
3212.16 is is present in psychological
3214.619 literature yes because of this
3216.96 relationship to the autonomic system
3218.52 well it's a metaphor in literature
3220.859 it's crucial so you you spoke to a
3224.16 number of different threads that I think
3225.72 are important here so that's the
3227.64 definition that I learned and I was I
3229.619 heard that and I was like hell no that
3231.359 doesn't work for me it doesn't work for
3232.98 anyone I know
3234.66 and I spent a lot of time especially in
3238.26 medical school and in my internship
3240.18 where you rotate on medicine
3242.66 disimpacting
3244.319 women like older women who come in who
3246.839 haven't had a bowel movement in a month
3248.72 whoa and that let me tell you that is
3251.339 not nice for anybody yeah believe me I
3253.859 became a scientist not a physician for a
3255.96 number of reasons both positive and
3258.119 negative that's one of them yeah so my
3261.48 definition of constipation as a western
3265.22 mostly white girl
3267.18 is that if you're not having a bowel
3270.24 movement every single morning and you
3272.94 have a feeling of complete evacuation
3276.3 anything less than that is constipation
3279.66 so that's how I Define it if you're in
3282.54 India and you're eating food that's got
3285.96 a fair amount of microbes in it it's
3288.059 less you know sanitary I'm using that
3291.119 word
3292.859 um as carefully as I can
3294.78 generally they have a bowel movement
3296.94 after every meal
3298.68 but they've got a different microbiome
3300.359 they're exposed to different microbes
3301.859 here in the U.S I would say Wednesday
3305.04 you also spoke to something very
3307.5 important which is the balance between
3310.5 the parasympathetic nervous system rest
3313.319 and digest and poop versus the
3316.26 sympathetic nervous system kind of the
3317.819 on button you know
3320.04 fight
3321.18 flight freeze spawn
3323.88 so I think for those of us who've got
3327.66 issues with autonomic balance
3331.92 it can lead to constipation and I like
3334.68 that constipation could be pulled out
3337.079 and kind of writ larger as an important
3339.839 signal what sorts of tools do you
3342.119 recommend people use to
3344.579 um
3345.42 relieve constipation
3347.579 um in eating more fiber sounds like
3349.92 reducing stress is going to be a huge
3351.78 one yes what are your favorite stress
3354.42 reduction tools
3355.98 um I like to divide these into
3358.16 real-time tools so a big proponent of
3361.68 like physiological sign real time you
3364.02 know these sorts of things but things
3366.0 that can really lower the Baseline on
3368.579 stress overall to facilitate
3370.94 constipation and other other broad
3374.579 indicators of Health
3377.22 so I'm not a fan of lowering stress I'm
3381.54 a fan of lowering perceived stress and I
3384.119 think the distinction is really
3385.26 important
3387.48 I learned when I was in my 30s that
3392.7 I was a massive stress case and I didn't
3394.98 know it it was just sort of
3397.319 I think I through residency through
3399.66 working 120 hours a week I just was so
3401.76 accustomed and sort of
3404.64 um that was 120 not under 20 folks yeah
3407.94 not unusual in in medicine well they
3410.819 they've changed training so that you
3413.099 work no more than 80 hours a week now
3415.079 but that was before my time
3417.42 so
3418.92 I became
3421.579 accustomed to a massive amount of
3424.8 cortisol massive
3426.78 and
3428.28 I would say I've spent the past 20 years
3430.319 really working on perceived stress to
3432.78 find I think all of us in all a cart
3435.18 menu
3436.26 of what is most effective
3438.9 so what works for me now at my age is
3442.14 different than you know the the TM I did
3444.96 as a college student Transcendental
3446.579 Meditation it's different than the I
3449.16 became a certified yoga teacher when I
3450.66 was in my 30s that is very effective for
3453.0 a lot of people
3454.02 it wasn't enough for my Matrix
3457.44 I do holotropic breath work
3460.92 um I didn't read it but I saw it she
3462.66 just had a paper and sell on your sign
3464.579 and
3466.859 um it kind of it made me think like
3469.68 teach me how to teach teach me how to
3471.96 sigh like can you say a little bit about
3473.819 that like how do you do it yeah very
3475.98 briefly that study was we we wanted to
3477.839 find a minimal effective dose
3479.46 intervention yeah I just wanted yeah so
3481.859 five minutes a day we need to figure out
3483.059 what people do every day yeah and we
3484.8 were monitoring
3486.3 subjective mood Etc but also Biometrics
3488.94 remotely so it's kind of a nice
3490.44 Biometrics HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep
3494.579 cortisol uh I wish
3496.92 um so this was done during the pandemic
3498.44 more than 100 subjects the advantage was
3501.059 that we got data 24 hours a day because
3503.22 they're pinging us in their data uh
3505.44 wearing HRV 24 yeah nice so that was
3508.44 nice resting heart rate
3510.359 um subjective mood we would get in touch
3511.68 with them daily so when people were
3514.559 swapped between groups like any good
3516.059 study but five minutes a day of sort of
3518.22 standard if you will forgive me
3520.26 meditations are just sitting no
3521.819 instructions about how to breathe just
3523.2 focusing on
3524.819 um closing their eyes and focusing on
3526.559 focusing yep
3528.599 um another group did box breathing yep
3530.88 inhale hold exhale hold for equal
3532.38 durations the duration of each of those
3534.599 inhales and holds was set by their
3536.7 carbon dioxide tolerance so somewhere
3539.04 between three and eight seconds
3541.319 depending on how well they regulate
3542.88 carbon dioxide
3544.26 another group did cyclic signs so this
3547.26 would be double inhale through the nose
3548.7 so big inhale through the nose
3554.76 followed by it to lungs empty exhale
3557.579 that second inhale after the first big
3560.22 long inhale through the nose is really
3561.54 important because it makes sure that all
3563.339 the collapsed abiola the lungs totally
3565.859 snap open and then the exhale you
3567.42 offload a lot of carbon dioxide that's
3569.579 very similar to holotropic breath work
3571.319 not yes not not
3573.48 um not unlike holotropic breath we're a
3575.64 little bit pranayama-ish but the exhale
3578.579 is rather passive as opposed to active
3581.72 and then the fourth category was cyclic
3584.16 hyperventilation which is a lot like
3585.96 Tumo AKA Wim Hof ish breathing different
3589.02 than Wim Hof breathing so this would be
3591.78 so very active inhales and exhales
3594.839 every 25 cycles of inhale exhale that'll
3597.42 be one cycle long exhale hold lungs
3599.76 empty 15 to 30 seconds then repeat for
3604.38 about five minutes now the info everyone
3606.24 did that for five minutes and what we
3607.74 found was that the cyclic sign led to
3609.48 the greatest improvements in mood Around
3611.64 the Clock not just around the the
3613.5 practice or during the practice as well
3615.48 as lowered resting heart rate
3617.359 improvements in sleep
3619.5 Etc and you got it publish and sell yeah
3621.9 we were so amazing we're very fortunate
3623.7 I think um the the thankfully the
3627.42 reviewers and editors understood that
3628.98 these minimal intervention things uh
3631.26 hopefully are going to be of use to
3632.4 people so so useful to people I mean how
3635.22 often do you read a paper like that that
3637.68 could offer a behavior change
3640.799 that is so easy to implement I mean I
3643.92 love that question thank you so what
3647.099 about did you tell them not to drink
3649.2 because alcohol has such a huge effect
3651.18 on HRV yeah so in this case we didn't
3653.04 tell them to alter anything else about
3654.72 their behavior just hoping it was
3656.099 background kind of across the system yes
3658.98 and some were Stanford students others
3660.599 were from the general population any
3662.94 Frat Boys that were drinking heavily
3665.339 probably not well during the pandemic I
3667.44 think alcohol intake went way way up
3669.9 across the board
3671.46 um I mean isn't if I had a magic wand I
3673.38 would I would ask that people either not
3674.94 drink or drink two drinks per week
3676.74 maximum at least that's my understanding
3678.42 of the literature
3679.98 um are you familiar with the whoop data
3681.42 with alcohol no but we have a
3683.46 collaboration with through that paper
3684.96 yeah um and it certainly disrupts
3687.24 patterns of nighttime sleep in
3689.339 particular from my understanding that
3691.26 first phase of sleep that's related to
3693.54 the massive growth hormone release that
3695.28 you all really need and want in
3697.26 different measure growth hormones we did
3698.94 not no the second iteration of this
3700.559 study will certainly include free
3702.48 cortisol by saliva hormone panels well
3705.24 I'm beginning to think that we should
3706.319 also
3707.4 um be asking people how often they're
3708.66 going to the bathroom and what time of
3709.859 day yes I mean this thing around
3711.48 constipation is uh is super interesting
3714.0 and I think that plus um blood markers
3716.76 and then I'm I'm very excited to learn
3718.619 that
3719.52 um that urine contains additional
3721.859 markers that could be informative so
3723.599 yeah it was it was a fun study uh not
3726.24 easy study to do with that number of of
3728.22 subjects um takes a lot of training for
3730.859 your research assistants yeah it was a
3732.839 big group it was nine people in our
3734.099 group and three clinicians and a lot of
3736.38 a lot of phone calls and a lot of back
3738.0 and forth but you know and thank you to
3739.799 the subjects who served as the uh the
3741.78 real life guinea pigs so yeah I think
3743.4 that stress you know people's I think
3745.68 people are starting to appreciate that
3747.119 there are ways that they can relieve
3748.38 their stress that that don't only fall
3750.96 under the categories of vacation right
3753.359 and meditation but I want to say that
3755.579 meditation is obviously a wonderful tool
3758.52 um it's just it's a it's a tool not
3761.22 unlike any other tool that is great for
3763.44 some people and less great for others
3764.94 well certainly it's a great tool and
3766.559 it's got such a scientific basis behind
3768.54 it
3769.319 but there's so many things on this a la
3771.72 carte menu sex orgasm
3775.44 um connection
3776.94 feeling heard and seen and loved
3780.72 um yeah let's talk about that you know
3782.28 you mentioned earlier that all these
3783.359 stress factors you you said patriarchy
3785.4 right yeah but I think what if I may
3788.339 um at risk of uh of just strengthening
3791.7 that uh statement I I mean that that to
3794.04 me is is signaling a bunch of other
3796.44 factors around us you said like keeping
3798.359 keeping things in
3801.119 um
3802.16 what do you think explains let's talk
3805.319 about that because I think that that's
3806.76 likely to have raised a certain flag in
3808.38 people's minds like what exactly is she
3810.059 talking about are you talking about less
3811.74 opportunity are you talking about less
3813.66 opportunity to
3815.7 um to vocalize are you talking about
3817.74 less opportunity to vocalize and be
3819.48 heard I mean I realize that there are an
3821.099 infinite number of variables but given
3822.78 that it sounds like a really strong
3825.359 input to the system uh what I mean by
3828.599 that is that psychology is influencing
3830.819 biology and you're saying that that
3832.38 these uh
3833.88 that these power power dynamics
3837.14 structures and Dynamics are impacting
3839.52 I'd love let's hear your thoughts on
3840.9 that because uh I I hate to let a flag
3843.54 like that go by without fleshing it out
3845.94 and never waste a good flag well and
3847.859 let's preface it by by just saying that
3849.9 like people will have different opinions
3851.339 on this and that's and I think that's
3852.599 healthy and like with the discussion
3854.22 about constipation let's talk about what
3855.78 people aren't willing to talk about when
3857.099 it comes to health love it so we might
3860.22 need to talk about patriarchy on part
3862.38 two but I'll give you some material that
3864.72 I've been working with
3866.52 I started I did not even understand the
3870.18 existence of patriarchy until I was a
3872.64 bioengineering undergraduate at MIT I
3875.579 should mention which has always had a
3877.2 bit of a of a male
3879.9 um askewed male in terms of Faculty
3882.059 numbers well my my that's true at most
3884.46 universities true well my postdoc
3885.9 advisor was the late Ben Barris who was
3888.72 a female to male transition transgender
3891.66 interest first transgender member in the
3893.52 National Academy of Sciences were my
3894.78 closest friends unfortunately he died of
3896.4 of pancreatic cancer we were very very
3898.5 close they're actually making a
3899.579 documentary about Ben but Ben this is
3901.98 interesting Ben went to MIT because he
3904.859 wanted to be around a lot of men yeah
3906.78 that's a lesser known fact but then he
3908.579 was a very strong advocate for women he
3911.819 went as Barbara when he was Barbara and
3915.42 um by the way he's given me permission
3916.98 to share all this prior to his death I
3919.02 recorded a lot of conversations yeah
3921.66 um I only ever knew him as Ben by the
3923.64 way but when he was at MIT he was
3926.4 identified female and he later talked
3930.42 about the intense
3933.24 um
3933.839 suppression oppression literally is how
3936.119 he described it especially given that he
3938.46 was performing so well yes so you just
3941.46 defined patriarchy
3943.26 you did it yourself
3945.839 a couple things
3947.819 when I was in bioengineering
3951.059 I took a women's studies class
3953.099 and it was all about teaching
3955.5 undergraduates about the existence of
3957.599 patriarchy which I would Define maybe at
3960.66 its simplest as power over
3964.2 I'm not saying men are patriarchy I'm
3966.9 saying something very different which is
3968.64 power over
3971.22 let me correct one thing that you said I
3974.04 didn't go to MIT as an undergraduate
3976.38 so I'm from I was in Alaska and I went
3979.559 to the University of Washington for
3981.359 bioengineering in Seattle in Seattle
3983.579 okay I dropped out of a graduate program
3986.46 in bioengineering to go to the Harvard
3989.88 MIT
3991.44 program for Health Sciences and
3993.42 technology in Boston thanks for that
3996.0 clarification University of Washington
3997.44 also wonderful place I have many many
3999.78 many many many many many wonderful close
4002.539 colleagues there it's an incredible
4003.98 place especially for vision science
4006.2 it's especially good for engineering
4008.18 bioengineering but
4010.64 um yeah so my my MD is jointly between
4014.24 MIT and Harvard and it's the oldest
4017.839 maybe largest although Harvard says this
4020.839 a lot program for biomedical engineers
4023.92 and uh MD phds physician scientist
4028.64 training program
4030.319 great thanks for that clarification I'm
4032.42 going to blame the internet for this one
4033.92 I am I think we need to send our our
4036.559 Wikipedia editors out there I think
4038.66 LinkedIn is correct okay great well
4040.88 Wikipedia editors note get out there and
4044.299 make that make the correction now you
4045.74 heard it
4046.76 um so
4048.319 stress that is what you're really
4050.18 talking about is systemic stress in the
4052.099 body as a concept as a consequence
4054.559 excuse me of systemic stress of
4056.119 environment that's right
4058.819 you know there's particular forms of it
4060.559 I would say this also relates to
4063.44 White Privilege it relates to
4066.88 racism
4068.839 and when you look at
4070.94 you know kind of the way that systems
4073.46 including my beloved MIT
4076.4 the way that they're set up is that
4078.079 might make us makes right
4080.059 and generally the people that are the
4082.099 strongest
4083.299 you know big men strong men they're the
4085.7 ones who tend to be the most successful
4088.22 so for people who are bipoc for people
4091.52 who don't have white privilege for women
4094.819 it's a different experience and so I'm
4097.279 using patriarchy as kind of a
4099.739 umbrella here but it connects to many
4103.339 other things
4104.42 I'd like to take a brief break and thank
4106.88 our sponsor inside tracker inside
4109.58 tracker is a personalized nutrition
4111.199 platform that analyzes data from your
4113.12 blood and DNA to help you better
4114.98 understand your body and help you reach
4116.66 your health goals I've long been a
4118.58 believer in getting regular blood work
4119.96 done for the simple reason that many of
4122.359 the factors that impact your immediate
4123.92 and long-term Health can only be
4125.66 analyzed from a quality blood test the
4127.64 problem with a lot of blood and DNA
4129.08 tests out there however is that you get
4130.94 data back about metabolic factors lipids
4133.64 and hormones and so forth but you don't
4134.96 know what to do with those data
4136.179 insidetracker solves that problem and
4138.5 makes it very easy for you to understand
4139.94 what sorts of nutritional behavioral
4143.299 maybe even supplementation based
4145.4 interventions you might want to take on
4147.38 in order to adjust the numbers of those
4149.239 metabolic factors hormones lipids and
4151.4 other things that impact your immediate
4152.779 and long-term Health to bring those
4154.64 numbers into the ranges that are
4156.5 appropriate and indeed optimal for you
4158.239 if you'd like to try inside tracker you
4160.339 can visit insidetracker.com huberman and
4162.859 get 20 off any of inside hackers plans
4165.199 that's inside tracker.com huberman to
4168.08 get twenty percent off I want to use
4169.94 this as an opportunity to a keep this in
4172.759 mind as I return to a question that I
4175.94 didn't close the hatch on earlier and
4177.799 it's my fault which is I'm now clear on
4180.38 the fact that a woman in her late teens
4183.44 early 20s ought to know something about
4185.179 her testosterone estrogen thyroid
4186.739 cortisol levels
4188.779 should start at least thinking about her
4190.4 microbiome
4191.6 should be thinking about
4194.299 how how many bowel movements and the
4196.64 timing of those bowel movements per day
4199.1 really and
4201.5 I'm assuming that what I just described
4203.9 is also true for women in their 20s 30s
4207.199 40s 50s on up to hundreds is that
4210.38 correct
4211.52 that's correct but I would say that
4213.08 there are
4215.78 differential opportunities
4218.3 by decade
4220.04 so I'm glad she circled it back to
4222.46 teenagers and testosterone because I
4225.26 think if you know
4226.94 for instance in your teenage years that
4231.14 you have high androgens and that you've
4233.36 got this potential phenotype way into
4235.88 the future that you may not even notice
4237.32 I mean maybe you notice you've got a few
4239.0 extra hairs on your chin or something
4241.64 if you know that your testosterone is
4243.62 elevated or some other androgen it might
4246.38 change the Arc of how you take care of
4248.239 yourself so I think that could be very
4250.04 helpful in your teenage years in your
4252.62 20s for people who are a stress case
4255.26 like me so age 27 on the words at UCSF
4260.78 if I had known that I was such a high
4262.58 cortisol person
4264.56 I think I would have done things
4265.76 differently I would have changed my
4267.38 behavior
4268.52 and I don't know because I didn't base
4270.92 case these but
4273.08 your testosterone
4275.179 can decline starting in your 20s kind of
4278.06 depending on how much stress your Matrix
4280.699 is under so for women that can start as
4283.159 early as 28 usually your testosterone
4286.1 declines by about one percent per year
4288.38 what level of testosterone do you like
4290.48 to see in a woman once she's sort of
4292.34 post let's say after age 25 what kind of
4294.98 range is healthy I know what the
4296.3 reference range is only because I know
4298.52 one could look it up I don't know it's
4300.02 off the top of my head immediately but
4302.36 what what's a kind of a nice reference
4305.96 point there so the way I tend to
4308.06 describe this on podcasts is the top
4310.64 half of the normal range great
4313.28 so that I think is a good benchmark
4315.92 you know for PCOS
4318.8 generally it's much higher than that you
4321.32 know I've seen patients with PCOS where
4323.3 their total testosterone is 100 to 200.
4325.58 do they always have peripheral
4326.96 manifestations of that a little bit of
4328.64 hair the the skin plaques I've heard
4330.62 about you know so darkened skin
4331.699 irregular periods regular periods is
4334.04 that
4334.76 um you know I get a lot of questions
4336.32 about PCOS yeah
4338.36 um and you're the first person we've had
4340.94 on this podcast that's really qualified
4342.26 to talk about PCOS in a real way
4345.14 um so here we're talking about too many
4346.76 androgens cysts on the ovary irregular
4349.88 ovarian
4351.219 excuse me I keep saying that ovulatory
4353.54 slash menstrual cycle
4356.179 um
4356.96 what are some other indicators and do
4359.9 you recommend that women start taking
4362.12 Androgen blockers or so or I mean how do
4365.0 seems to be a lot of PCOS out there I'm
4366.98 hearing about it a lot
4368.9 so glad you asked about this so PCOS is
4371.719 one of those really
4373.34 poorly understood conditions that gets
4376.88 it kind of flows flies below the radar
4379.04 until a woman wants to get pregnant or
4381.8 she's got some other issue that drives
4383.9 her to a physician
4386.12 the problem is that it is a syndrome
4389.12 right so polycystic ovary syndrome
4392.179 sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome
4395.12 and syndromes don't necessarily fit
4397.82 together into a really clear diagnostic
4400.94 criteria
4402.5 so in this instance there are three
4405.38 different criteria that we look for so
4407.3 this is on the ovaries having
4410.06 um clinical manifestations of
4412.54 hyperandrogenism so that could be
4414.26 hirsutism acne other things and then
4417.32 usually irregular periods and the way
4419.659 that that's defined at least by the uh
4422.719 latest criteria is having a period every
4425.239 35 days or less
4427.64 so typical cycle length 28 is 35 days
4430.699 you know you're skipping a period here
4432.32 and there
4433.4 so those are the those are the criteria
4435.44 that we use to diagnose PCOS there are
4438.14 about four different systems out there
4440.78 in the literature for diagnosing PCOS
4442.82 which is where it starts to get
4444.56 confusing so there's some women who have
4447.699 gnosis on their ovaries but they've got
4450.5 hirsutism and they've got irregular
4453.14 periods could you define haircitism here
4455.6 statism is increased hair growth usually
4457.82 in places that you don't want it so for
4460.04 women it can be you know kind of male
4461.6 pattern they might notice it on their
4462.98 breasts on their chest
4465.5 um
4466.28 and then there's of course a familial
4469.28 quality to that like I was just looking
4471.02 at a paper last night looking at
4472.719 Israelis and how much hair statism they
4475.4 have and whether this is related to CH E
4478.219 repeats on the Androgen receptor
4480.56 do they get um not Israelis but um do
4482.96 women who
4484.219 um who might have PCOS experience um
4486.86 androgenic alopecia so hair loss that's
4489.199 sort of of the quote-unquote male
4491.0 pattern baldness of course it's Androgen
4492.86 pattern baldness as opposed to male
4494.719 we're talking about testosterone DHT
4496.76 related sometimes you know this is where
4499.4 I'm going to invoke clinical experience
4501.08 rather than what I've seen in the
4503.239 literature women definitely can have
4505.46 some androgenic alopecia
4508.76 I tend to see it later in life
4511.52 but this is an important point because
4513.38 we think of PCOS as you know I was just
4516.26 talking about it in teenage years like
4517.94 wouldn't it be nice to know that you
4519.86 have this phenotype and you're at risk
4521.659 for all the things that people are at
4523.159 risk for and we haven't talked about
4524.239 glucose and Insulin yet we should
4527.239 what we know is that
4529.58 PCOS is not just a problem in terms of
4532.28 irregular periods and then difficulty
4534.92 getting pregnant so those are mostly
4537.08 problems in your 20s 30s early 40s but
4541.1 it is a massive risk factor for
4544.34 cardiometabolic disease as you get older
4547.04 so many people tend to pigeonhole PCOS
4550.34 is a problem of reproductive age we have
4552.86 to be thinking of it over the entire
4554.54 female life cycle and I would say it's
4557.84 even more important to consider it over
4560.6 the age of 50 you know average age of
4562.28 menopause is 51-52 because we know that
4566.179 that elevated testosterone the high
4568.1 androgens
4569.48 are probably the greatest cardio
4572.0 metabolic driver of disease for women
4575.54 with PCOS wow now one other thing I want
4578.3 to mention and I still have my notes
4580.64 that we're going to talk about
4581.239 microbiome testing because that's such a
4582.92 fun subject
4586.1 what I was taught to do
4588.14 again saying this was so much love for
4590.3 the people who have taught me how to do
4591.8 medicine what I was taught to do is that
4594.199 if you have a woman with PCOS you make
4596.0 the diagnosis you measure her
4597.5 testosterone you see if she has acne
4599.3 blah blah
4601.58 you ask that woman one question
4605.54 do you want to get pregnant or not
4608.3 so then you have these women with PCOS
4610.4 who get started on a birth control pill
4612.5 if they don't want to get pregnant if
4614.719 they want to get pregnant then you help
4616.58 them get pregnant by addressing some of
4618.92 these PCOS issues like maybe you give
4620.78 them Clomid or you do something to make
4623.12 them ovulate more frequently
4625.4 that is the way that most conventional
4627.8 medicine approaches this and it does
4629.54 women at gigantic disservice so one of
4631.82 the things I'm speaking into is the
4633.8 gender gap that exists so I my feeling
4638.239 is that the research money that goes
4641.0 into women's health is abysmal compared
4643.699 to what goes into mental health really
4645.62 and I think that's changing but there's
4647.719 also a huge lack of awareness of sex and
4650.42 gender differences when it comes to the
4652.159 way that we construct
4653.9 clinical trials and other experiments
4656.3 well that's absolutely true I mean I sit
4657.86 on I've sat on NIH review panels for
4660.14 more than a decade now I'm a regular
4661.88 standing member which is only to say
4663.14 that I see the research as it's being
4665.12 proposed yes and now
4668.06 it's required no Grant will get funded
4670.76 without
4671.719 sex as a biological variable and here
4673.64 I'm by the way folks this is sex
4675.64 biological sex the noun not sex the verb
4678.62 both are super interesting obviously but
4681.44 um when we say sex is a biological
4682.82 variable meaning even if it's a study on
4685.4 mice how did that start though that
4687.679 didn't start that long ago it must have
4688.94 been I think we can think
4691.04 I don't want to miss attribute here I
4692.42 think we can thank Francis Collins for
4693.92 insisting on this amen Francis
4696.34 Bernadine Healy has done so much to help
4699.08 us but you know she made the Women's
4701.719 Health Initiative which I hope will get
4703.34 to
4704.48 which is a hot mess like so confusing
4706.82 the data that came out of that yeah so
4709.04 and these trials are long and so the
4710.48 data are only now starting to emerge so
4712.46 just to be clear I mean I have a a
4714.739 question that I don't think is going to
4716.12 take us off track but this is I'm going
4717.5 to pose this question as a hypothesis
4719.06 because I think it's likely to be a
4721.58 little bit of a of a not a barbed wire
4724.4 question but maybe like a prickly
4726.199 question when people first hear it but
4728.12 it's posed as a hypothesis you mentioned
4730.4 some of the psychosocial stress issues
4732.64 based on at the organizational level
4735.44 institutional level societal level maybe
4737.48 right down to the family and and just
4740.12 life that are biasing Health outcomes
4743.6 for the worse in female populations okay
4746.179 you refer to as the patriarchy I'm just
4748.159 trying to put it make sure that we're
4750.02 both talking about the same thing and
4751.4 that's non-exhaustive I realize that's
4753.44 just a subset of the issues
4755.78 I'm also hearing there's a lot more PCOS
4758.199 which is hyper androgenization of the
4762.62 ovary in there we're talking about you
4765.8 mentioned you know excess testosterone
4767.54 which females naturally have more
4769.88 testosterone than they do estrogen
4771.44 anyway but we're talking about elevated
4773.54 levels
4775.159 here's a hypothesis one hypothesis would
4778.4 be that the increased androgens and the
4781.219 pieceo PCOS are a consequence of the
4784.58 psychosocial conditions that are
4787.58 I don't say forcing but are biasing the
4790.219 need for females to
4793.94 um think behave react act in certain
4796.58 ways
4797.5 to survive let alone Thrive is that a I
4801.679 don't say this for any kind of political
4803.179 correctness hypothesis this is a in my
4806.6 this would be a fun interesting and I
4808.64 think important study to run right
4810.219 depending on stress and the conditions
4812.719 the specific
4814.159 type of stress do females under produce
4818.48 or over produce androgens or is it a
4822.38 neutral effect does that make make sense
4824.56 I love this question so let me just
4827.78 paraphrase the last part of it to make
4829.46 sure I got it
4830.78 it sounds like what you're asking is
4833.719 could PCOS or at least some phenotypes
4836.179 of PCOS be a response to what I'm
4839.3 calling patriarchy
4841.46 and then you add a second part to it
4843.56 which is do healthy women
4846.199 like what is their production of
4847.58 testosterone like is that right yes and
4849.679 and with the acknowledgment I mean
4851.179 you're the expert here
4852.739 um you're the physician clinician an
4854.659 expert in hormones and I'm not but with
4857.9 the understanding that absolute levels
4859.88 of hormones are interesting but perhaps
4861.82 not as interesting as the ratios of
4864.44 testosterone to estrogen so when we're
4866.179 talking about excess testosterone we're
4867.98 really not talking about oh women making
4869.48 a lot of testosterone because frankly
4871.1 they already make a lot like then most
4873.8 people that weren't aware of that I
4875.179 wasn't aware that women make more
4876.44 testosterone right and so it's not
4879.32 saying that testosterone in women is bad
4881.0 or is always a reaction to the
4882.32 environment yes but when it becomes
4885.44 um super physiological or hyper elevated
4888.159 is I could imagine all sorts of social
4891.02 conditions that would create that so in
4894.86 males and females but here we're talking
4896.659 about PCOS and females in particular so
4898.58 I'd love for you to speculate
4900.92 um should we run the study we should
4902.48 totally run the study because
4905.06 I don't know the answer
4907.4 I suspect that you're onto something
4911.06 it may not explain all of the women with
4913.4 PCOS because as I mentioned there's a
4915.199 lot of different phenotypes but I think
4917.36 it could explain
4919.34 a significant portion
4921.86 and you know you're almost you're saying
4924.32 if we look at the gene environment
4926.12 interface this environmental influence
4929.06 of having being someone who's got power
4931.94 over you if if PCOS was a response to
4935.42 that
4936.98 the way that we treat it would be
4939.38 completely different
4941.84 so on the one hand I want to be careful
4943.82 not to dismiss the suffering and
4946.52 experience of women with PCOS I've got a
4948.679 lot of women with PCOS in my family and
4951.62 it is
4954.02 there's so much pain and suffering you
4956.12 know especially if you want to have a
4957.38 baby and you try for years and you just
4960.199 can't ovulate
4963.98 on the other hand
4967.52 I read a paper recently and maybe we
4969.98 could cite this
4971.36 that compares the phenotype of a woman
4973.64 with PCOS to a man who is hypoandrogenic
4978.38 and I think that's a really interesting
4980.719 way to look at this because
4984.679 the thread we haven't talked about with
4986.36 PCOS is the the role of insulin and
4989.84 glucose
4991.159 so for some of the phenotypes of PCOS
4995.48 the problem is hyper insulin emia High
4998.179 insulin in the blood is driving those
5000.34 thika cells and ovaries to overproduce
5002.5 testosterone these women are insulin
5004.48 insensitive so
5005.92 more insulin is being cranked out
5008.44 and these cells in the ovary are
5010.0 therefore making more Androgen you don't
5011.98 like to say insulin resistant oh I I can
5014.5 uh I don't have a problem saying okay
5016.92 I'm just a little bit outside the lane
5019.48 lines of my expertise so I was trying to
5021.1 use it what is the correct nomenclature
5022.9 so that we can make sure well what I
5024.58 like about insulin insensitive the way
5026.199 that she just said it is that I think
5028.06 that offers people a way in and I love
5030.34 to do that in terms of messaging insulin
5033.219 resistance starts to lose people because
5035.14 they don't really get what that means at
5036.76 a receptor level I think I say insulin
5038.8 insensitive because when people hear
5041.02 insulin sensitive it almost sounds like
5043.36 a bad thing but that's actually what you
5044.739 want so I think I think that's how I
5046.42 defaulted to insulin what's your insulin
5048.94 I don't know what I'm due for a blood
5051.159 test yes you are I'm due for a blood
5052.9 test um I had blood work done for eight
5055.06 months um sure that'd be great I uh I'm
5057.88 always
5058.659 um experimenting with different
5059.5 supplements and different behavioral
5061.179 regimens and I've kept charts since I
5063.219 was 19. oh you're like my patient I I've
5066.159 been sort of Obsessed by this and I
5067.78 would say
5068.98 everybody if you can afford it and at
5071.199 the time actually I had to save up
5072.58 Insurance wouldn't cover it
5074.679 um get some basic blood work done so you
5077.08 have a reference do it as soon as
5078.64 possible because even you know the we've
5081.4 been talking about these women over the
5083.679 life cycle
5084.94 I wish I knew what my insulin was when I
5087.52 was a teenager I wish I wish I knew what
5089.26 my fasting insulin was I really wish I
5091.36 knew my postprandial insulin like in my
5094.6 teenage years in my 20s in my 30s well I
5097.54 knew it in my 30s starting at 35. are
5099.94 you a fan of continuous glucose monitors
5102.46 the hugest most gigantic fan of cgms
5105.28 I've never seen any tool that I've ever
5107.199 used in medicine change Behavior the way
5110.02 that cgms do wow why do you think they
5112.659 are so effective at changing Behavior
5115.06 I've tried one and I really liked it I
5116.98 learned that in the sauna my insulin or
5119.86 my blood glucose goes up probably by a
5121.48 bit of dehydration I learned what kind
5122.98 of foods work for me which don't
5125.56 um I thought it was fascinating I
5126.88 learned how every Behavior you could
5128.26 possibly imagine use your imagination
5130.0 impacts blood glucose totally totally
5132.219 fascinating to me including how a
5134.32 two-way wake-ups during the middle of
5136.12 the night versus one versus none
5137.56 impacted blood glucose the next morning
5139.84 fascinating for a data junkie like me it
5142.36 was like I was in heaven
5144.52 um why do you think they are so
5146.02 effective in changing behavior is it
5147.46 because of that that people can see that
5148.719 real-time control like scan in and like
5151.0 oh that's the that's the sandwich I
5153.58 think it's I think it's many things I
5155.32 think it's
5157.54 generally the enchantment
5159.94 of learning about your own chemistry and
5162.219 biology I love it and I think for me
5164.92 what I've seen you know I feel like
5166.54 doctors are basically marketers
5169.179 like the sacred marketing like our job
5171.639 as a physician is to convince people
5175.06 to do something that we think is good
5176.739 for them based on the best science
5179.38 but we can't just say here I wanted to
5181.84 fill this prescription for a ctm you
5183.88 have to Market it you have to say
5186.1 I think this completely changes the way
5189.4 that you approach your pre-diabetes I
5191.26 think this could dramatically affect
5193.84 your risk of Alzheimer's disease that
5196.0 you're so worried about that your mother
5197.38 has so our job as Physicians is to be
5200.679 that sacred marketer
5202.48 so cgms are one of my tools that I think
5205.06 are so crucial so enchantment number two
5207.82 yeah it's the real-time effect
5210.28 so if you go get your glucose and
5212.44 Insulin measured or maybe you do like a
5214.42 two hour glucose challenge test where
5216.699 you look at glucose and Insulin at the
5219.1 fasting point one hour later two hours
5220.84 later or more frequently
5223.0 that does not have the same kind of
5225.34 behavior effect as having continuous
5228.1 data where you can say okay I drove to
5231.28 see you Andrew from my place in Berkeley
5233.679 and it was stressful it was torrentially
5236.82 raining and I know my glucose was
5239.56 elevated like I think really
5241.36 understanding
5242.679 what the
5244.48 the mediators are of your glucose
5246.88 control is essential now that said
5249.82 it's also kind of a later effect I mean
5251.86 I'd rather know your insulin and we know
5254.38 from uh the white hat white Hall study
5257.62 that insulin especially postprandial
5260.62 insulin vascular insulin 2 can change
5262.84 years and years before you get a change
5265.54 in glucose
5266.86 so um that's more for pre-diabetes and
5270.28 diabetes so I think those are the main
5272.38 reasons why I think it's such an
5273.76 important tool
5275.56 third thing is it democratizes data
5279.58 which you do too I mean incredible how
5281.86 you do that with your podcast but I
5284.38 think one of the most hopeful and
5286.84 exciting things that I'm seeing right
5289.0 now
5289.84 in the health space is that we're going
5293.44 from
5294.76 this patriarchal relationship where
5297.1 doctors hold the power and are The
5299.62 Gatekeepers of data to patients and
5303.28 clients having much more access to that
5307.179 enchantment about their own chemistry
5309.82 and their own biology so to me that is
5312.58 so exciting like for me to be able to
5314.8 I've got you know probably 100 patients
5318.28 that are in a data stream with me where
5321.46 we're looking at their glucose and I can
5323.199 I mean I'm on sabbatical so I'm not
5325.0 doing this so much anymore but I can
5326.38 call a patient be like why is your
5328.48 glucose so high like what did you do oh
5330.4 it was my birthday I had a piece of
5331.84 birthday cake like that kind of
5334.78 collaboration
5337.659 that also is
5339.699 teaching the patient to be their own
5342.42 clinician to me that is a loop of
5345.94 benevolence and integrity that I think
5348.52 is essential to creating Health we've
5351.94 got a disease care system we need the
5354.34 democratization of data to become a
5357.28 health-based system
5359.32 Amen to that a million times over we
5362.32 share that sentiment I can tell it at a
5365.199 deep level I I think the pandemic
5367.48 actually assisted in well harm to many
5370.06 things but it assisted in people's
5371.62 understanding that um no magic fairy nor
5375.34 the government nor any anyone was going
5377.5 to arrive at their door with a kit of
5379.6 things to make them healthy right that
5381.34 provide sunlight movement sleep and all
5383.199 the various aspects of nutrition no
5385.42 nothing nothing that everyone has to
5388.3 have access to first and foremost and
5390.94 then
5391.6 Implement those things as best they can
5393.52 speaking of which and kind of circling
5396.04 back to this idea of people in their
5397.239 late teens 20s 30s and onward
5399.52 if you had a magic wand
5401.44 and you could give like two or three
5403.96 don'ts or to make it personal if you
5406.78 could go back in time and
5408.76 erase certain behaviors what would the
5411.88 the don'ts category be
5415.179 um you can tell us more than two or
5416.98 three
5417.88 um but if the goal is to maximize
5419.94 vitality and Longevity and those are not
5423.94 always uh parallel to one another right
5427.12 they're certainly not the same thing
5428.199 sometimes orthogonal but let's just say
5430.659 fertility
5432.28 being a proxy for vitality and Longevity
5434.8 I think people will sometimes forget
5435.699 this that fertility isn't just about
5436.84 people who want to conceive children
5437.92 it's also it's a it can serve as a proxy
5440.62 for vitality and Longevity so what would
5443.5 you like to see patients let's focus
5445.9 first on female patients but
5448.239 um if it extends to male patients as
5449.86 well what would you like to see them not
5451.6 do yeah or do far less of I really like
5454.84 that
5456.28 so I would say a few things I'll just
5457.96 headline them and then we can go into
5459.219 detail number one sleep
5461.5 I do want to diverge from you a little
5463.48 bit on some things but sleep is probably
5465.46 not one of them oh well feel free I mean
5467.739 you're the one that worked 100.
5469.739 120 hours a week sleeping much then I
5472.78 can't imagine unless unless you lived in
5474.1 a different reality than I do
5475.96 um uh you know and there are times in my
5478.239 career where I was pulling all-nighters
5479.679 and sleep deprived there's just it I
5481.659 don't recommend it but I did it yeah I
5484.0 hope you don't do that anymore no longer
5485.62 if I can avoid it but there were years
5487.42 many years where it was like all right
5489.639 here we go and I'm quite
5491.679 um
5492.52 Adept at it for one cycle yeah but two
5495.699 nights I kind of start to fall fall
5497.139 apart totally yeah so I would say sleep
5499.78 alcohol High perceived stress and I'd
5503.26 love to talk about maybe
5505.0 um the date on telomeres and what we
5507.04 know so you'd like to see people get
5508.6 enough sleep so don't don't just yeah
5511.6 not all of these are concordant so um
5514.12 not enough sleep too much alcohol too
5517.239 much perceived stress
5520.12 eating the wrong Foods
5523.6 toxic relationships
5527.5 and isolation and then number six
5532.719 um
5534.34 not moving enough or not moving and
5537.159 exercising in a way that really fits
5539.08 with your body so we start with that one
5541.84 actually just because it's such a and
5543.28 then work backwards um uh that's
5545.739 interesting I I
5547.48 think nowadays people appreciate the
5549.4 need for quote unquote cardio I know
5551.62 that the the exercise physiologists
5553.48 cringe and and dissolve into a puddle of
5555.699 Tears when I say that but getting the
5557.38 heart rate up over some period of time
5559.78 longer than 10 minutes
5561.82 in order to generate cardiovascular
5564.159 health circulation so and resistance
5566.26 training of some kind maybe flexibility
5567.82 what do you mean by Body phenotype or
5570.28 and exercise I'll speak from personal
5572.98 experience so what I did through I mean
5576.28 I gave up my 20s to Medicine
5578.86 and during that time I occasionally got
5581.92 to the gym you know at UCSF on Parnassus
5584.679 you could go to the gym and then as soon
5586.9 as your beeper went off you're back into
5589.0 the hospital
5590.56 but I didn't exercise much I had um do
5592.96 you remember Nordic tracks I had a
5594.4 Nordic Track in my house and that was
5596.32 that was like it what I believe because
5599.5 for me the primary
5602.56 outcome that I'm interested in is
5604.54 cardiometabolic health
5606.34 so when it comes to exercise what I
5608.26 really feel
5609.28 if we're going to be at a population
5610.84 level
5612.82 I feel that about a third cardio
5615.58 two-thirds resistance training is based
5619.48 on my synthesis of the literature the
5621.82 best combination
5623.26 and I think there's you know as you
5625.239 described with your sign
5627.94 um study I think there's a minimal
5630.34 effective dose which for a population is
5633.88 about 150 minutes I think most of us
5636.46 need a lot more than that per week per
5639.46 week but I think you know for me
5642.699 because I have a phenotype that
5646.48 produces a lot of insulin kind of
5648.58 depending on
5649.78 how I'm on my game I have a lot of
5652.54 glucose so I have to exercise a lot more
5654.88 to dispose that glucose so I think you
5658.12 then have to move from medicine for the
5660.699 population or prescriptions for the
5662.98 population to what works for the
5665.38 individual
5666.94 I think that recommendation is fantastic
5669.88 um I think resistance training well let
5672.159 me put it this way I'm neither a trainer
5673.96 nor a physician but I've seen in family
5675.58 members that were doing
5678.04 I wouldn't say a lot of cardio but just
5679.78 cardio that when they add resistance
5681.58 training everything in terms including
5683.8 their biomarkers
5686.26 um have improved dramatically yes in
5688.78 particular for female members of my
5690.76 family well one of the one of the
5692.86 mediators that I think is important
5694.42 especially for people who do what I call
5696.219 chronic cardio which is what I did
5699.219 is cortisol
5700.9 so we know that
5702.659 Runners especially marathon runners
5705.159 people who do a lot of cardio and don't
5708.699 do much resistance training they tend to
5710.44 have much High cortisol levels and you
5712.3 can buffer that with vitamin C vitamin C
5714.159 can decrease the effect but
5717.28 chronic cardio doesn't always serve
5719.679 people so quick personal example when I
5722.5 first started measuring hormone panels
5724.42 in myself I went to my physician and I
5727.9 said I'm 35. I've had one kid I want to
5731.5 have another kid
5732.699 I've never been so exhausted in my life
5735.639 I just feel like I'm pushing a rock up
5737.199 the hill
5738.159 I've got this belly fat that I don't
5739.78 like and
5741.76 um
5742.36 I don't want to have sex with my husband
5744.34 so
5745.719 what do you think what can we do about
5747.28 this
5748.179 and he offered
5749.86 a birth control pill
5751.48 and an antidepressant oh goodness so I
5754.239 left him and I went to the lab and I ran
5756.76 a hormone panel and my cortisol was
5759.1 three times what it should have been my
5761.26 insulin was in the 20s I was fasting my
5764.26 glucose was 105.
5766.48 my thyroid was mildly abnormal my
5770.5 progesterone was low and that set me on
5773.38 this course of realizing that
5776.5 what I was doing as a physician taking
5778.6 care especially of women was not getting
5781.9 to some of these root causes that are so
5784.0 essential and I would say I had to start
5786.159 first with cortisol
5788.139 at that time I was running four miles
5790.36 three times a week four times a week
5792.04 that was just racing my cortisol further
5794.98 so that was not the right exercise for
5796.78 me I needed more adaptive exercise I
5798.82 started doing Pilates more yoga that
5801.46 helped to lower my cortisol I mean it
5803.26 started me on you know changing the way
5805.84 I was managing perceived stress and it
5808.0 also changed my supplement Richmond
5810.219 can we talk about that and what the
5811.9 moment you said lowering cortisol
5813.52 thought of the two supplements that come
5816.1 to mind are
5817.78 um ashwagandha which I think can
5819.46 potently reduce cortisol but I've heard
5821.8 some recommendations about cycling it
5824.62 and I've always wondered about time of
5826.42 day for ashwagandha intake because sort
5828.52 of quote unquote want cortisol elevated
5830.679 in the early part of the day yes and we
5832.42 know this
5833.5 uh we know you do not want cortisol
5836.02 peaking later in the day no you do not
5837.88 interferes with sleep interferes with
5840.159 sleep
5841.179 um and then the other supplement is uh
5843.76 rhodiola rosacea do I am I pronouncing
5845.92 that correctly yeah so radiola is very
5847.78 effective it's been shown in multiple
5849.58 randomized trials to lower cortisol so
5851.62 that could be very effective what sort
5853.36 of doses I've started taking it recently
5855.28 by the way and I made a huge mistake I
5857.139 like to make the mistakes first so then
5858.639 my audiences don't make them
5861.1 um as I was taking it I heard it was an
5862.84 adaptogen so I thought oh I'll take it
5864.34 before resistance training but of course
5866.38 you want the cortisol Peak during
5867.76 resistance training because that's going
5869.38 to set in motion the Adaptive response
5870.82 so I start taking it later in the day
5872.08 and it's really improved I would say my
5874.239 late day second half of the day
5876.28 cognition this is subjective to be fair
5878.86 I just feel like I'm in a more even
5880.96 plane of attention in the second half of
5882.88 the day so you're describing an NF1
5884.92 experiment right which is organic data
5886.78 well it is not anecdotal so I was taught
5891.04 at Harvard Medical School that the
5893.32 hierarchy of evidence starts at the
5895.48 lowest with expert opinion you know case
5899.139 studies then you've got cohort studies
5901.96 and you've got
5903.3 observational data that's prospective
5905.56 then you have randomized trial but the
5907.48 highest quality evidence of all is the
5909.699 end of one experiment where you serve as
5912.04 your own control
5913.3 so what you're describing with rhodiola
5914.92 I would frame that as an end of one
5916.48 experiment where you have a washout
5918.28 period and you compare before and after
5920.199 and I'd like to measure some other
5921.88 metrics to see if there's an effect
5923.739 including your cortisol so radial has
5926.38 been shown in multiple randomized trials
5928.0 to reduce cortisol
5930.28 the other thing that I think is super
5931.84 effective is phosphatidylserine PS for
5935.62 short
5936.88 fish oil also more modestly reduces
5939.88 cortisol
5942.0 ashwagandha is interesting so in my
5945.52 first book the hormone cure
5947.679 which I read by the way you did I did I
5950.139 was hoping that was the one you read I
5951.34 did I read it and it's spectacular and I
5953.38 thought going into it I had this like
5955.179 you know let's just call it what it was
5957.04 it's called male bias like is there
5958.3 going to be anything in here for me
5959.38 because uh I'm I don't have ovaries and
5961.78 you know it's gonna be and it was
5963.219 immensely informative
5965.44 um so thank you yeah I have very fun
5967.6 Recollections of the the walks I took
5969.28 listening to it and then I own the print
5970.719 version too so I like to switch back and
5972.52 forth so thank you for that it's a it's
5974.56 a superb book for anyone to read yeah
5976.6 yeah I so appreciate that
5978.76 so
5980.32 in chapter four you may or may not
5982.42 remember that ashwagandha at least the
5985.179 time that I wrote that book
5986.46 ashwagandha's data is not great but lack
5989.38 of proof is not proof against so with
5991.56 ashwagandha most of the data comes from
5994.179 thousands of years of using it in
5996.04 ayurvedic medicine and it's considered
5998.46 again not my science hat it's considered
6001.5 a double adaptogen so that it's
6003.84 potentially helpful when you are a high
6007.44 cortisol phenotype like I was like I
6010.199 sometimes still am
6011.76 or low cortisol
6014.52 I haven't found that in my patients
6016.739 although I'll give you one exception
6018.84 so ashwagandha is mostly based on animal
6021.179 studies there's not as much human data
6023.639 but it is used a ton in Integrative
6025.98 Medicine
6027.48 the
6028.679 um there's one supplement that I found
6031.679 to be incredibly helpful for people who
6033.84 tend to have high cortisol at night
6035.88 and that's called a cortisol manager
6037.56 it's by integrative Therapeutics
6039.84 I don't have a second
6041.88 um supplement manufacturer that makes
6044.04 something similar it's their number one
6045.719 selling supplement because it's so
6047.34 effective is it a cocktail of several
6049.08 things it's a combination of
6050.239 phosphatidylserine and ashwagandha so
6052.62 tell me more about phosphatidylserine I
6054.48 am familiar with it for it's been
6057.12 mentioned by some guests that were on
6059.34 the Tim Ferriss podcast long ago for
6060.96 other reasons I think related to sleep
6062.82 yes um and maybe that's another reason
6064.92 why you like it um but before we move on
6067.98 from rhodiola is there a dosage of
6069.659 rhodiola rosacea that you um so I would
6072.239 refer people to my book because the
6074.34 randomized trials and the doses that
6076.5 were used are in there so I can't
6078.84 remember with rhodiola although I took
6080.46 it this morning to prepare to be with
6082.02 you yeah we can look it up and put a
6083.88 show note caption so I can remember the
6085.739 dose with phosphatidyl serum because I
6087.42 take that regularly so 400 to 800
6089.88 milligrams is the typical dose for PS
6092.159 and what's interesting is that in the
6094.92 randomized trials that were done
6096.9 400 milligrams was more effective than
6099.119 800 milligrams interesting I've found
6101.219 that for several supplements that the
6102.719 lower dose was more effective yes
6105.6 um yeah I won't it doesn't matter what
6107.4 those were and so when you say PS you
6109.44 were referring to by the way folks not
6110.639 PCOS just because
6112.46 scientists and clinicians are familiar
6114.36 with and Military very familiar with
6115.739 acronyms uh phosphatidylserion PSO 400
6118.139 to 800 milligrams 400 being more
6119.82 effective taken later in the day or
6121.92 early day does it matter it depends on
6124.02 when your cortisol is high so for me I
6127.44 tend to you know what's the pattern for
6129.78 cortisol typically it rises to its peak
6133.679 30 to 60 minutes after you get up then
6136.56 it has this gradual kind of asymptotic
6138.78 decline until you go to bed
6141.06 so if you're someone like me who Peaks
6144.719 like way crazy high I don't do that
6146.94 anymore but that's what I used to do I
6148.92 needed phosphatidylserine in the morning
6151.199 for people who are high at night who
6153.9 have what's known as a
6155.94 a flat cortisol pattern or a inverted
6159.06 pattern you want to take it at night
6161.88 and the flat pattern just quick sidebar
6164.34 is that that's associated with a number
6167.52 of conditions that most mainstream
6169.8 Physicians don't know about so a flat
6172.02 pattern where it's low in the morning
6173.76 and it's high at night is associated
6175.86 with anxiety depression
6178.02 uh decreased survival from breast cancer
6180.239 that was studied at Stanford by David
6182.28 Spiegel that's that he was my
6185.159 um collab close even collaborator even
6187.92 uh on the breath work study that we oh
6190.56 interesting yeah he's our associate
6192.36 chair of Psychiatry now so a wonderful
6194.46 human being has amazed has been a guest
6196.32 on this podcast and and I'm now
6198.119 fantasizing about a conversation that
6199.679 includes uh a panel of of uh Incredible
6203.52 Minds like you and David from the
6204.96 clinical side so in any case um yeah the
6207.3 late shifted cortisol not good not good
6210.08 and it seems to have the worst
6215.48 immune Downstream
6218.159 issues of any of the cortisol patterns
6221.28 so that's really important to know about
6223.08 because it then maps to things like
6226.44 um
6227.1 it's related to PTSD
6229.44 so that's the pattern we see like in
6231.06 vets who've got PTSD as well as others
6233.58 it maps to autoimmunity it maps to
6237.6 fibromyalgia
6239.46 I was told that 1 in 12 people
6244.02 um have are heterozygous so one mutant
6247.98 copy or a hypomorphic for some some
6250.739 mutation in adrenal related genes so
6254.219 congenital adrenal hyperplasia is that
6256.679 true and if so that means that 1 in 12
6259.32 people walking around are cranking out
6261.179 far too much cortisol or not enough
6262.8 cortisol or the cortisol system is
6265.199 already skewed in a direction that makes
6266.639 life more challenging at the levels
6268.38 we're talking about
6270.239 um did I hear that correctly because
6271.8 that 1 in 12 is not a small number it's
6273.96 not a small number it fits with what I
6276.0 see clinically
6277.44 I mean I want to see that data just to
6279.96 see
6280.8 um what does that mean and could you
6283.199 modulate it with environmental
6284.76 influences but it certainly fits with
6287.699 what I see you know I was taught once
6289.8 again in mainstream medicine that in
6292.02 terms of adrenal function
6295.26 it's very binary how most clinicians
6298.92 think about it you either have Addison's
6302.04 disease and you don't make enough
6303.0 cortisol or you've got cushions or
6305.58 Cushing weed pattern and you make too
6307.5 much cortisol and anything in the middle
6309.3 is normal and my experience is that hell
6312.78 no like there are those of us like me
6315.06 who make a lot of cortisol I don't have
6316.739 cushions maybe I've got one of these I
6319.8 wouldn't call it a mutant Gene I would
6321.54 call it more of a
6323.42 vulnerable Gene so maybe I have one of
6326.58 those maybe that's part of the reason
6327.6 why I make you know two to three times
6329.82 what I should be I'm aware of certain
6332.52 groups of individuals from within the
6335.34 military sector that
6337.38 um have there's a more frequent
6339.48 occurrence of
6342.06 some mutation in CCH congenital adrenal
6345.42 hyper prevention not necessarily two
6346.56 copies which will if people look that up
6348.119 they're going to go oh wow there's all
6349.38 these phenotypes and
6352.139 um but sort of hypomorphic type thing so
6355.5 you know less than or too much cortisol
6357.96 and they are very good at staying up
6360.06 multiple days per night right multiple
6362.94 nights in the series so they can pull
6364.679 all-nighters very easily yeah they can
6366.48 push harder when most people would quit
6368.04 and everyone thinks well that's a great
6369.48 phenotype to have but guess what it's
6371.219 because they hyper produce cortisol yeah
6372.96 and um so that's interesting and I think
6377.159 if we were to panel medical students and
6380.219 graduate students and you would look at
6381.659 you know who's pulling excessively long
6383.34 hours who's stressed out a lot even
6386.219 outside of Academia and medicine and
6388.5 pushing pushing pushing really hard I
6390.119 think the ability to push and not crash
6392.28 we think of it as adaptive but in some
6394.679 sense it's maladaptive over a series of
6396.42 years which is sort of what you
6397.98 described earlier yeah it's such a good
6399.84 point because
6402.0 you know you in some ways you want to
6403.98 select for that in certain professions
6406.44 like in the military like in medicine
6410.04 um
6411.719 but I would wonder for those folks about
6414.6 the downstream consequences of producing
6417.06 so much cortisol oh it's got to be
6418.86 detrimental for their health it's got to
6420.48 be in the long run and and you see that
6422.04 but even the data shows that if you're
6424.56 someone like me who makes a lot of
6426.0 cortisol
6427.139 higher rates of depression like 50 of
6429.36 people with major depression have high
6431.34 cortisol levels higher rates of suicide
6434.94 um much more metabolic dysfunction we
6437.82 know that trauma as an example maps to
6440.46 an increased risk of glucose metabolism
6443.4 issues and certainly High cortisol does
6446.1 that because it's one of the jobs of
6447.96 cortisol is to manage a glucose
6450.179 and it's
6452.46 it kind of sets you up for
6454.86 um this one
6456.48 number five which is toxic relationships
6459.239 you know someone who hyper produces
6461.28 cortisol it's hard to live with someone
6463.5 like that it's also I would say people
6465.6 that have this
6467.159 um let's just call it biological
6469.26 resilience
6470.4 it's not always adaptive because you can
6472.56 stay in bad circumstances longer the
6474.6 ability to to crash
6476.82 provided it's not suicide or life life
6479.219 destroying or you know long Arc of
6482.52 of pause and the requirement to you know
6484.86 take two years off from work or school
6486.42 or something
6487.92 um the ability to keep pressing on is a
6490.02 double-edged sword let's put it that way
6492.3 um I want to make sure in staying within
6495.06 this conversation uh because you
6496.739 mentioned Foster dial serine we talked
6498.36 about rhodiola rosacea we talked a bit
6501.36 about ashwagandha you've also talked
6503.04 about Omega-3s and fish oil in
6504.719 particular I'd love to know your
6506.159 favorite sources of these I think
6507.48 nowadays there's more General acceptance
6510.659 that getting these essential fatty acids
6513.239 is important do you have a threshold
6515.52 level of sort of grams I I've encouraged
6518.04 uh
6519.36 um podcast listeners to consider
6521.639 depending on what they're eating to try
6523.26 and get a gram of EPA or more per day
6526.26 does that seem excessive and what are
6528.719 the real data on epa's because then the
6531.56 cardiovascular experts always hit back
6534.239 and say oh no you know it's not good for
6535.92 cardiovascular health and then you go oh
6537.54 it's better than antidepressants and
6539.34 other studies and they go no so I feel
6541.26 like if you really want to make your
6542.94 life difficult if you want to raise your
6544.08 cortisol you go on Twitter and you say
6546.179 something positive about Omega-3s and
6547.739 fish oil and
6550.08 um and you learn a lot
6551.88 um what are your thoughts on Omega-3s I
6553.98 take a lot of them I've always been a
6555.3 big fan yeah so this is where I
6557.159 personalize I think some people need
6559.739 more than others and what I do is I
6563.58 measure your level so this gets back to
6565.679 nutritional testing so for you I would
6568.139 suggest an Omega Quant or one of my
6571.26 favorite cardiometabolic panels is to do
6573.6 a Cleveland heart lab so I think they
6576.06 they give me the most reliable
6577.44 information not just for lipids and
6580.08 subclasses and you know NMR
6582.179 fractionation but it also gives me an
6584.76 insulin resistance score it gives me
6588.119 um levels of Omega-3s great we'll
6590.76 provide links to these different sites
6592.679 so that people but one quick thing about
6594.6 that the whole story is not Omega-3s and
6598.44 taking fish oil so the work of Charlie
6600.9 Sirhan at the Brigham is showing that
6605.04 the way that we resolve inflammation
6610.56 our understanding of it is really I
6613.199 think in the learning to crawl stage and
6615.719 so if you look at the omega-3 6 pathway
6619.199 in the body
6620.88 fish oils can help you know kind of push
6624.02 the reactions in a particular direction
6626.6 but typically they're not enough for the
6629.639 resolution of inflammation now what most
6631.98 people do including my MBA players is
6634.8 they pop an ibuprofen or something like
6638.04 that when they've got inflammation
6639.659 that's got lots of other side effects
6641.88 that are not so good for you and we know
6644.699 in terms of the resolution of
6646.44 inflammation that taking something like
6649.679 ibuprofen reduces the amplitude of
6652.02 inflammation by about 50 percent but
6654.239 then it potentially blocks the complete
6657.36 resolution of inflammation
6659.219 so there's these new supplements that
6661.5 you may have heard of called specialized
6663.179 pro-resolving mediators there's a lot of
6665.219 different supplement companies that make
6666.659 them and that combined with fish oil
6669.679 seems to be the best combination and
6672.06 what I do for athletes who've got you
6674.28 know kind of the normal aches and pains
6676.1 of the training load they have is all
6679.56 combine a little aspirin
6681.719 small dose just like 81 milligrams or
6684.719 two of those baby aspirin together with
6687.239 fish oil plus specialized pro-resolving
6690.36 mediators and there's some that are NSF
6692.04 they're certified for sports but the
6695.159 the dose I would say with my patients
6698.219 some of them only need
6700.199 a thousand milligrams your Gram that you
6702.659 mentioned for the population some of
6704.58 them need
6705.6 six grams together with spms
6708.54 so I think it has to be personalized
6711.54 how young
6712.8 um
6713.94 is it okay for
6716.159 people to start taking Omega-3s for
6719.34 instance young women and their teens
6722.34 people in their 20s and their 30s young
6724.26 guys in their 20s and 30s should they
6726.84 take fish oil if just as a assuming
6729.3 they're not going to get anything tested
6730.38 I'm thinking about the college student
6731.58 who is really into biomarkers and that
6733.92 sort of thing we'll go do some of this
6736.02 um
6736.82 but many people won't but they want to
6739.02 do the right thing so they'll try and
6740.159 drink a little less hopefully hopefully
6741.36 they won't smoke or vape please don't
6742.98 smoke or vape the idea that vaping is
6745.139 okay it's like we had it was so bad so
6748.199 bad for everything we're talking about
6749.219 let's end that it's like exactly so just
6751.56 you know avoid hopefully they'll try and
6753.78 avoid those things hopefully they'll
6755.46 avoid hard drugs
6757.26 um hopefully they'll avoid getting any
6758.82 STIs if they do they'll resolve them
6761.04 quickly hopefully yes um so but they
6764.34 might say oh well okay I'm willing to
6766.02 you know take some magnesium or take
6767.76 some phosphodel serine buffer my
6769.199 cortisol eat some vegetables
6771.179 um should they consider taking fish oil
6773.04 as a kind of across-the-board
6774.48 inoculatory thing so I put to rank order
6776.88 these I would say fish oil yes
6779.94 I think a thousand milligrams as a
6781.739 general recommendation is good but I
6783.36 also have a food first philosophy so my
6786.0 preference would be that they're having
6787.26 salmon or some kind of Smash fish and
6790.199 they're getting that as the primary
6792.239 source of their Omega-3s and then the
6794.4 days that they don't have fish I
6796.199 recommend it probably twice a week that
6798.06 they take fish oil then I would put
6799.86 magnesium next since so many people are
6802.08 deficient then I'd probably put vitamin
6804.0 D
6804.96 what how many IU of vitamin D per day
6807.06 well you keep asking me this like for
6808.98 the the population yeah well for the let
6811.08 me put it this way for the laze for the
6813.06 lazy person
6814.5 or and this is an or not an and or the
6818.219 person who
6820.32 um just doesn't have the finances to go
6822.48 get measured yeah levels measured
6824.219 because you know our audience is a huge
6825.84 range we've got people who can have tons
6827.34 of disposable income that list in the
6828.719 spot we have people have no disposable
6830.219 income so a thousand to two thousand
6832.02 international units but my you know what
6834.3 I do is I dose to a serum level that's
6837.6 between about 50 and 90. great and so I
6840.96 have a vitamin D receptor
6842.82 uh snip and so I need to take about 5
6845.94 000 a day to get to what I need a lot of
6848.159 people don't need that
6849.84 and you know there's some supplements
6852.54 that
6854.159 I don't know if they need so you
6855.54 mentioned phosphatidylserine for someone
6857.639 who's a college student and their
6859.44 cortisol is completely normal they're
6861.119 wasting their money on PS they don't
6862.739 need it they might need it later but
6864.48 they don't need it now I'd like to make
6866.04 sure that we Circle back to birth
6868.02 control in particular oral contraceptive
6871.199 birth control
6873.3 and we should touch on iuds perhaps
6876.42 a little bit more but what are your
6879.119 thoughts on sort of pure estrogen birth
6881.699 control this is what I learned when I
6883.32 was in college is that birth control is
6884.76 basically tonic estrogen so constantly
6887.46 taking estrogen estrogen women are
6888.96 taking estrogen so that they don't get
6891.6 the estrogen
6893.58 priming of progesterone you're not
6895.739 getting any ovulation and I've known
6898.56 women that have been taking oral Contra
6901.679 or that took oral contraception as like
6903.9 estrogen
6905.34 pills basically for 5 10 15 years are
6909.48 there long-term consequences of this as
6911.34 it relates to pregnancy PCOS
6914.219 menopause what if so what are some of
6917.34 those consequences
6919.199 um
6919.8 what are your concerns what do you like
6921.48 about oral contraceptives what do you
6923.219 dislike about them
6924.78 I like how balanced you ask that
6926.699 question so
6928.26 women who take oral contraceptives as
6931.02 long as you're describing like 10 years
6933.36 or longer we call those Olympic oral
6936.0 contraceptive users
6938.28 in terms of benefit I think that
6940.44 especially when they first came out and
6942.179 even now it gives women reproductive
6944.34 choice and That's essential
6946.8 as you may know a reproductive Choice
6948.84 has been declining recently so I'm a big
6951.719 fan in that regard and we've got a lot
6953.34 of data to show both the risks and also
6957.0 the benefits of it
6958.44 so I'll speak first into the benefits
6960.84 because
6963.0 uh I'm gonna get on a soapbox a little
6965.94 bit about the risks so we know that it
6969.06 reduces the risk of ovarian cancer so
6971.4 there's something about this idea of
6973.38 incessant ovulation that is not good for
6976.679 the female body
6977.94 so if you look at for instance women who
6982.199 are nuns
6984.06 who don't take oral contraceptives and
6987.119 they have a period every single month of
6988.86 their reproductive lives they have a
6990.96 greater risk of a brain cancer
6992.94 so if you look then at women who have uh
6997.5 several babies and they've got a period
6999.48 of time when they're pregnant that
7001.28 they're not ovulating and then they
7002.659 breastfeed for some period of time they
7004.58 have a lower risk of ovarian cancer so
7006.98 oral contraceptives help with reducing
7010.46 ovulation and reducing risk we know that
7013.94 if you take the oral contraceptive for
7016.88 about five years it reduces your risk of
7018.5 ovarian cancer by 50 and that's
7020.84 significant because
7022.88 were so poor at diagnosing ovarian
7025.94 cancer early there's really no method
7028.58 that's really effective we use ca125 and
7032.0 ultrasound screen especially in women
7033.86 who are at greater genetic risk but even
7036.32 that often we diagnose it you know in a
7038.659 later stage maybe just because that
7041.119 statement is going to highlight for a
7042.679 number of people the question of what
7045.199 are some of the some earliest symptoms
7047.659 that people can recognize without a
7049.219 blood test so as ovarian cancer is it
7051.5 going to be pain
7052.699 so the problem is the symptoms are so
7055.159 vague and they're so non-specific one of
7058.219 the most common symptoms is bloating
7060.739 and we've already talked about
7061.76 constipation we've talked about how
7063.199 women have this longer track GI tract
7066.5 and so bloating is a really common
7068.0 experience for most women
7069.98 you can have bulk symptoms you know
7071.719 feeling like your your lower belly is
7074.119 kind of pressed out
7075.679 so
7077.0 the way that we
7079.219 inform women in terms of watching for
7082.159 this is to get regular gynecologic exams
7086.32 for women who are at high risk where
7088.639 they have for instance an ultrasound for
7090.44 some reason it shows a mass that we're
7092.3 concerned about there's a way to triage
7094.099 that in terms of what kind of evaluation
7095.9 that they need and that's the situation
7098.06 where you might get a blood test called
7099.8 the ca129
7101.659 CA 125.
7103.94 the um yeah the problem is the symptoms
7107.0 are so vague it could be it depends on
7109.88 how big the tumor is how much bulk you
7112.159 have what it's pressing on
7114.679 so if
7115.94 um taking estrogen and thereby reducing
7119.119 the frequency of ovulation
7120.82 lowers the risk of ovarian cancer should
7124.28 women that are even women who are not
7126.38 sexually active so they're they're not
7128.119 actively trying to get pregnant or avoid
7130.099 getting pregnant but if they're not
7131.599 sexually active then the probability of
7133.699 conceiving unless they go through some
7135.56 IUI or some other route is is very low
7138.5 as far as I know
7140.179 um so I was taught in high school anyway
7142.699 um
7143.54 would they be wise to suppress ovulation
7146.239 for periodically using hormone-based
7149.239 contraception just so that they can
7150.56 offset the risk of ovarian cancer that's
7153.679 a very rational question and I would say
7155.659 that's what mainstream medicine has had
7158.96 at its back to recommend oral
7161.84 contraceptives not just for women who
7163.699 are seeking contraception but
7165.86 for acne for painful periods for really
7170.06 kind of the drop of a hat they're
7172.34 prescribing oral contraceptives that's
7173.84 what I was taught to do
7175.219 but there are so many consequences and I
7177.619 think the issue here is more about
7179.48 consent because
7182.9 in OB GYN and I started out as a
7186.08 board-certified ob gyn and I now mostly
7188.78 see men but I was taught as an OB GYN to
7192.8 convince women to go on the oral
7194.42 contraceptive and I think a lot of that
7195.92 is pharmaceutical influence
7197.9 so maybe we could talk about the risks
7200.78 and why the answer is no to your
7203.42 question
7204.26 um as we do that could I just ask is the
7206.78 um the so-called ring the new it used to
7209.3 be called The nuva Ring maybe that's a
7210.5 brand name but when I was in college
7211.76 there was all this discussion about the
7212.9 ring all right by both men and women for
7215.119 reasons that don't belong on the podcast
7218.659 um use your imagination folks so
7221.06 um is the the ring obviously it's not
7223.099 oral it's not oral hormone contraception
7225.44 but it's hormone based right the rate is
7227.48 releasing estrogen locally as opposed to
7229.52 taking it orally but would you would you
7230.96 slot it under what you're about to tell
7232.76 us in terms of the concerns
7234.86 so we have less data about the ring
7237.8 so the oral contraceptive is two
7241.04 hormones it's ethanyl estradiol
7244.699 and it's a progestin so it's not the
7248.96 normal
7249.92 uh progesterone that your body makes
7251.84 such ovaries make and your adrenals make
7253.699 it is a synthetic form of
7257.54 progesterone
7259.099 and it is the same
7261.4 progestin similar same class that was
7265.52 shown to be dangerous and provocative in
7267.32 the women's health initiative so I'm not
7269.599 a fan of progestins I do not recommend
7273.08 them for any woman unless the
7276.26 consequence of not taking them is
7278.119 surgery or some other
7280.699 um
7282.32 you know unless it gives them some
7284.239 freedom in some way so I don't like
7286.82 Protestants the uh nuva ring is estrogen
7292.159 plus progestin but it's released
7294.5 transdermally through the vagina
7296.9 so
7298.159 given the the way that
7300.739 um it's delivered to the vagina
7304.219 the doses are lower than what's taken
7306.38 orally
7307.34 but in terms of some of the risks that
7309.38 I'm about to talk about we don't know
7310.82 about much of the data we think that
7313.4 it's similar there's probably a spectrum
7315.26 of risk and maneuvering is a little more
7318.44 towards the middle than you know what
7320.719 I'm talking about with oral
7321.679 contraceptives
7323.06 are you ready for that yeah I'm ready
7324.86 for the risks okay
7326.48 so like with almost any pharmaceutical
7329.9 the oral contraceptive depletes certain
7332.48 micronutrients
7334.219 so magnesium there's certain vitamin B's
7337.04 that are depleted
7338.3 uh
7340.04 it also affects the microbiome that data
7344.42 is not as strong but there seems to be
7346.28 some effect and there's also an
7347.659 increased risk of inflammatory bowel
7349.52 disease in autoimmune condition
7351.679 it increases inflammatory tone
7354.44 so the studies that I've seen increase
7356.86 one of the markers of inflammatory tone
7360.56 High sensitivity CRP by about two to
7363.26 three x
7364.82 it seems to make the hypothalamic
7366.739 pituitary adrenal axis more rigid
7371.239 so that you can't kind of roll with the
7373.52 punches and Wax and Wane in terms of
7375.619 cortisol production the way that you can
7377.42 off the birth control pill
7380.42 it can affect thyroid function
7383.9 I'm thinking of the slide that I have
7385.699 that has like 10 problems associated
7388.639 with oral contraceptive but that's what
7390.32 I can remember right now that's very
7392.179 helpful and it makes me wonder whether
7394.159 or not if on the one hand oral
7396.619 contraceptives are protective in women
7398.659 it's ovarian cancer but then they have
7400.46 these other issues yeah there's one
7401.9 other I want to mention please
7403.699 anytime you take oral estrogen it raises
7407.0 sex hormone by Nick globulin and you've
7409.099 talked to other podcast guests about
7410.78 this Kyle I think sex hormone binding
7413.54 globulin I think of as a sponge that
7416.599 soaks up free estrogen and free
7419.54 testosterone so when you go on the birth
7421.699 control bill you raise your sex hormone
7423.8 binding globulin it soaks up especially
7426.199 free testosterone
7428.06 and for some women it's not a big deal
7431.48 they don't notice much of a difference
7432.98 but then there's a phenotype maybe
7435.739 related to CAG repeats on the Androgen
7438.44 receptor
7439.699 who are exquisitely sensitive to that
7442.4 decline in free testosterone so this
7445.4 then opens the portal of talking a
7447.38 little bit about testosterone in women
7449.179 so we've mentioned already that it's the
7451.52 most abundant biologically the most
7454.4 abundant hormone in the female system
7456.199 even though men make almost 10 times as
7458.96 much or even more than 10 times it is so
7461.84 important for women it is essential to
7464.36 so many things not just sex drive and
7466.82 muscle mass and seeing a response to
7468.56 resistance training but also confidence
7471.44 in agency
7472.94 and so those women who are so sensitive
7475.94 to their testosterone level they've got
7477.679 this high sex hormone binding globulin
7479.719 their testosterone declines
7481.94 what they describe is vaginal dryness
7485.84 maybe a decline in sex drive but there's
7488.9 also this bigger issue related to
7491.119 confidence in agency even risk-taking
7493.159 from studies that we've done with MBA
7495.38 students that I think is a serious
7497.3 problem
7498.739 maybe the most important out of all of
7500.48 these things is that it can shrink the
7502.58 clitoris by up to 20 percent
7505.04 twenty percent and that includes the
7507.8 regression of the of the nerves that
7509.719 innervate the the clitoris is that I
7511.94 mean that's a very good question as a
7513.8 neuroscientist yeah I would think uh I
7515.719 used to teach uh the neural side of of
7518.06 reproductive Health we need to do a
7519.38 series on Sexual Health maybe you would
7520.76 co-host that with me
7522.28 we could certainly use your expertise I
7525.26 think um yeah that's a dramatic that's
7527.659 interesting number yeah but then let's
7530.179 go back to the sacred marketing if I've
7531.86 got a woman that I think should not be
7533.84 on the birth control pill maybe she's
7535.099 taking it for acne or she's taking it
7536.78 because her periods were a little
7538.099 painful what I'm going to do is say
7540.619 let's leverage these other ways of
7543.26 making your period less painful let's
7545.48 take the message of your painful periods
7548.02 and figure out okay it's your
7550.699 inflammatory tone and we give you some
7552.56 fish oil and spms maybe a little aspirin
7554.719 when you've got your period like let's
7556.219 find some other ways to deal with it
7557.719 then to take the oral contraceptive
7560.0 which you have not received informed
7561.98 consent about because it can trick your
7565.099  by up to 20 now that usually
7567.32 convinces most people to come reversible
7570.98 the elevation in sex hormone binding
7573.44 globulin does not seem to go away when
7576.86 you come off the birth control pill
7579.08 to me that is the biggest problem with
7582.56 prescribing oral contraceptives now the
7585.02 data that we have is limited there's one
7587.179 woman who uh Claudia has something
7589.58 something who looked at sex hormone
7592.099 binding globulin a year out from
7594.38 stopping the birth control pill and it
7596.36 was still elevated it wasn't as high as
7598.159 it was when they were on the pill but it
7600.139 was still elevated so your question
7602.119 about reversibility
7603.679 I don't know if we know the answer to
7605.3 that
7606.199 wow okay
7608.239 um
7609.02 that's yeah that's a significant
7611.06 statement
7612.08 and something that for consideration
7615.08 related to this although this might seem
7617.239 not related it is
7619.82 how early do you recommend that women go
7623.54 get their
7625.159 follicle number assessed in other words
7627.92 to get a size a sense of the size of the
7629.96 ovarian reserve and their amh levels
7632.48 measured um
7634.34 I'm gonna I'm an amateur Outsider as I
7636.86 say this but we have an episode on a
7638.36 fertility where I just described the
7640.34 ovulatory menstrual cycle yeah
7643.099 um and I'm not the best person to answer
7645.02 that yeah well I'm too far out from it
7647.239 okay well um I suppose then from taking
7649.699 the perspective of somebody who thinks
7651.98 about fertility it in terms of at least
7654.86 congruent with vitality and Longevity
7657.639 given that it's fairly non-invasive it's
7660.44 an ultrasound or a blood draw for amh or
7662.719 both
7663.739 is there any reason why a woman would
7665.659 not want to get her follicle number
7667.46 assessed or her amh levels assessed is
7670.4 there any reason
7671.719 why because I was shocked to learn that
7673.88 most women don't do this until they're
7675.98 hitting their late 30s or early 40s and
7678.98 yeah they're having conceived or they
7680.659 suddenly decide that they want to
7681.98 conceive and I thought why doesn't every
7684.8 doctor insist that their female patients
7686.54 get have their amh level
7689.06 addressed so that if they need to freeze
7692.0 eggs cost it's cost yeah so I think if
7694.88 you've got the disposable income to do
7696.619 it go for it it's not included in a
7698.9 standard blood panel no wow the only
7701.42 women in my practice who've had amhs
7704.3 done and have looked at their follicle
7706.46 count are women who
7708.32 want to freeze their eggs or and that
7711.38 requires disposable income or they
7715.52 um are having trouble getting pregnant
7717.56 so they are in the reproductive
7719.719 Endocrinology system and they're getting
7722.0 an evaluation and then they're also
7726.5 um the women who have symptoms of early
7728.36 menopause so premature ovarian
7731.06 insufficiency which is before age 40.
7734.119 uh those are the women that I see
7736.159 getting attested and I think you're
7737.719 right that it should be offered more
7740.42 broadly it speaks to the democratization
7742.58 of data again
7744.02 and I think most women don't know that
7746.54 so you're doing a huge service I think
7748.219 to be speaking into this
7752.54 one other point related to that is that
7756.32 what I see in conventional medicine
7759.86 is that when a woman asks for a hormone
7762.199 panel
7763.82 and she's not trying to get pregnant she
7766.34 usually gets told
7767.84 that hormones vary too much
7770.9 it's a waste of money you don't need it
7774.32 or if you're feeling hormonal why don't
7777.08 you go on a birth control pill
7779.36 unless she's trying to get pregnant
7782.239 if she's trying to get pregnant suddenly
7784.4 those same tests are very reliable and
7787.04 they get you know their their
7789.08 testosterone their free testosterone
7790.639 their thyroid panel they get their
7792.32 estrogen and progesterone maybe they get
7794.84 their cortisol they get their amh so
7798.139 there's a double standard
7800.119 between those who want to get pregnant
7801.739 and those who don't and that needs to
7803.54 end
7804.679 I totally agree as I've learned more
7806.179 about
7807.02 um ovulatory cycle and amh and and the
7810.56 antral population of follicles on it
7812.659 it's fascinating it just seems to me wow
7814.88 a relatively straightforward test one
7817.04 definitely invasive ultrasound but I
7820.28 don't consider that yeah that's not I'm
7822.139 not terribly invasive but invasive uh at
7824.599 least but the other one just pure blood
7826.04 test just seems like why wouldn't I
7828.32 wouldn't this be offered or covered by
7829.58 insurance or or you know that anyone
7831.26 that wanted but now now I understand why
7833.619 you mentioned menopause
7836.36 huge topic enormous topic we had a guest
7840.619 on the podcast who's not a clinician who
7844.159 said something in passing so I wanna I'm
7846.92 likely to get this wrong
7849.139 um but what they said was that the
7850.82 results of the large-scale trials on
7853.04 hormone replacement therapy for women
7855.26 for menopause said something to the
7857.599 effect of if the hormone therapy was
7859.46 started early enough it was very
7861.44 beneficial for yes vitality and health
7863.84 outcomes whereas if women
7865.699 went through menopause and then
7867.44 initiated the hormone therapy
7869.659 hormone replacement therapy that it
7872.719 could be detrimental to their health
7874.82 so first of all do I recall that
7877.639 statement correctly and then second of
7879.5 all what sorts of hormones are being
7881.78 replaced is it just estrogen and how is
7884.3 that done is it done through birth
7885.619 control so oral contraceptives nuvarings
7888.44 what are your thoughts on menopause when
7890.9 should people start thinking about it
7892.34 and what is the
7894.679 palette of things available so that we
7896.84 can do an entire episode with you on on
7899.3 this topic in the future but just to I
7901.28 you know I get a lot of questions about
7902.54 this and and I'm guessing based on
7904.82 everything you've told me today that
7906.26 there are women in their 30s that while
7908.96 they may be 20 years out from menopause
7911.06 probably should be doing things now in
7913.159 anticipation of that yes so we haven't
7915.26 talked about the 30 something but I
7916.76 totally agree with you the more you know
7919.159 about your phenotype your hormonal
7921.32 phenotype when you're in your 30s you're
7923.96 set up in terms of what to do in the
7926.54 future especially things like your
7928.88 thyroid your estrogen and progesterone
7930.5 levels because you can replace
7933.34 to a state of Youth thyroid
7936.44 whatever that is for you
7938.48 you can replace I don't usually go
7940.699 exactly back to where the estrogen and
7942.679 progesterone levels were but we can get
7944.78 pretty close so in your 30s having a
7947.48 base case I think is really essential
7949.639 so you spoke to the Women's Health
7951.619 Initiative which was published in 2002
7954.56 and we went from a huge number of women
7957.26 taking hormone therapy to a very small
7960.139 percentage like in the range of five
7961.76 percent
7962.659 and that means we've got millions
7964.76 millions of women who are suffering
7967.4 needlessly with things like insomnia
7970.579 difficulty with their mood difficulty
7973.28 with sex drive feeling like they are
7976.699 closing the store in terms of sex
7979.52 because they're not on hormone therapy
7982.579 I would agree with the statement that
7984.199 you made that hormone therapy particular
7986.719 forms that are similar to what your body
7988.699 always made when it's given judiciously
7991.34 at the right time
7993.199 typically within five to ten years of
7995.78 menopause which is 51 to 52 that it is
7999.739 incredibly safe so
8002.079 it's a complicated study the women's
8004.119 health initiative but it was the the
8006.52 wrong study in the wrong patients
8009.159 with the wrong medications
8011.739 and
8013.239 um with some of the wrong outcomes so it
8015.82 was powered to look at cardiovascular
8017.8 outcomes it was not powered to look at
8019.659 breast cancer it was stopped because of
8022.3 breast cancer risk but what happened in
8024.639 the control arm of the study was that
8027.28 they had an incredibly low rate of
8029.56 breast cancer
8030.88 and so as a result they ended up having
8034.659 this increased risk of breast cancer at
8037.36 five years and they stopped the study
8040.0 now the study was done with synthetics
8042.04 it was done with conjugated equine
8043.9 estrogen known as Premarin and medroxy
8046.78 progesterone acetate those were the
8048.699 so-called estrogen and progesterone
8051.06 those are synthetic hormones we think
8054.52 especially the progestin is associated
8056.56 with the greater risk of breast cancer
8058.199 although the the subsequent
8061.739 re-evaluations of the data now 18 years
8064.78 out have shown that
8067.36 um
8068.199 this problem with the control group and
8070.719 no increased risk of breast cancer
8073.78 um
8074.44 and for the women who got estrogen only
8076.719 those who had a hysterectomy the
8078.82 Premarin they actually had a decreased
8081.639 breast cancer risk and decreased breast
8083.92 cancer mortality
8087.159 so there's a lot to be said about this
8088.9 I'm trying to keep it really brief
8091.9 but if you look at the women 50 to 60 So
8096.28 within 10 years of menopause they're the
8098.679 ones who seem to have the greatest
8099.76 benefit
8100.96 so they had a decreased subclinical
8104.159 atherosclerosis so less cardiovascular
8106.42 disease they had an improvement in terms
8109.36 of bone health
8113.5 um less progression to diabetes and then
8117.159 over the age of 60 they started to have
8120.159 greater risk of certain outcomes such as
8122.739 cardiovascular disease myocardial
8124.3 infarction and so on
8128.26 you asked about
8130.42 um
8131.5 what do I do
8133.36 and
8135.34 to me this problem is not just menopause
8138.52 what's more interesting is to talk about
8140.92 perimenopause
8142.48 so perimenopause is the the period of
8145.36 time before your final menstrual cycle
8148.119 and for most women depending on how it's
8150.46 tuned you are to the symptoms it can
8152.98 last for 10 years so I'm still in Period
8156.219 menopause it's been like 20 years
8158.44 because I've been tracking it so
8160.0 carefully
8161.56 it usually gets kicked off by having
8163.48 your cycle get closer together so that
8166.0 could happen in your 30s or your 40s you
8168.219 go from 28 days to 25 days that sort of
8171.04 thing you may notice that you start
8172.719 sleeping more poorly because
8173.86 progesterone is so important you talked
8175.599 about that with Kyle
8177.34 you may notice it as more anxiety
8179.44 difficulty is sleeping and that probably
8181.54 is related to the estrogen receptor so
8184.9 your Alpha is estrogen receptor Alpha is
8188.44 anxio
8189.82 it increases anxiety
8192.219 ER beta is associated with an anxiolytic
8195.58 activity and then there's a total of
8198.28 about six estrogen receptors now there's
8200.74 the the g-protein-coupled estrogen
8203.5 receptors and those are mixed anxiolytic
8206.019 anxiogenic
8207.639 so um there's this whole period of
8210.519 perimenopause and what's Most
8212.32 Fascinating to me and we've got to talk
8214.179 about this either today or another time
8216.42 is that there is this massive massive
8219.76 change that happens in the female brain
8222.519 that people are not talking about enough
8225.099 and so looking at the work of Lisa
8227.74 Moscone at Cornell
8230.32 from uh starting around age 40. there is
8234.219 this massive change in cerebral
8236.2 metabolism so you can do fdg pet scans
8238.96 you can look at glucose uptake and
8241.54 there's about
8242.62 on average a 20 decline from
8245.679 pre-menopause
8247.24 you know up to like age 35
8250.059 to perimenopause to post menopause
8253.96 the women who are having the most
8256.0 symptoms in perimenopause menopause The
8258.099 Hot Flashes the night sweats the
8259.54 difficulty of sleeping those are the
8261.399 ones who have the most significant
8263.04 cerebral hypomatabolism
8266.5 so it's almost like a
8268.719 um I don't I don't want to scare people
8270.16 with this language but it's a
8272.62 low level or let's call it pseudo
8275.5 dementia of sorts yes it it seems to be
8278.439 a phenotype that you can then map
8281.559 to Alzheimer's disease because that's
8283.899 Lisa moscone's work she's looking at
8285.939 okay
8287.32 Alzheimer's disease is not a disease of
8289.359 old age it is disease of middle age what
8291.76 are some of the biomarkers that we can
8293.32 Define that can tell you what your risk
8296.08 is I've got a mother and a grandmother
8298.599 with Alzheimer's disease you can believe
8300.04 I am all over this data and insulin
8302.62 resistance it's a huge part of
8304.479 sensitivity as we talked about before
8306.7 um seems to be somewhere in there which
8308.979 I think when that first when that idea
8311.439 first surfaced a few people like really
8313.059 but then of course right I mean the
8314.439 brain is just incredibly metabolically
8316.12 demanding organ
8317.559 you deprive neurons of
8319.54 fuel sources they or you make them less
8321.939 sensitive to fuel sources they start
8324.16 dying they certainly start firing less
8325.899 it makes perfect sense and I think now
8327.639 it's thanks to Lisa's work work that
8329.859 you've you've done and talked about
8331.42 quite a lot is um in your books and
8334.0 elsewhere I think has really you know
8335.679 highlighted for people that
8338.08 metabolism and metabolomics is going to
8341.439 be as important as genes and genomics
8343.96 when it comes that's right dementia
8346.179 perhaps especially in women is it safe
8348.88 to say that I think I think so because
8354.04 we believe that this system is regulated
8357.58 by estrogen
8359.26 so the decline in estrogen starting
8361.3 around age 40 43 is kind of the average
8364.08 seems to be the driver behind cerebral
8367.059 hypomatabolism the way I describe it to
8368.92 my patients is
8370.599 it's like slow brain energy
8373.0 so you walk into a room you can't
8374.62 remember why like you just notice that
8376.66 you can't manage all the tasks the way
8378.7 that you once could like things are just
8380.5 a little slower
8381.82 and I say that to women and they're like
8384.16 I have that like help me
8387.399 so this is then circling back to Whi
8390.52 where women are scared to death of
8393.1 taking hormone therapy and we've got all
8396.1 of these women that are Marching toward
8397.84 potentially a greater risk of
8399.88 Alzheimer's disease and they have this
8402.28 opportunity in their 40s and their 50s
8404.62 to take hormone therapy and they may not
8406.72 be offered it
8408.22 because the typical conventional
8410.14 approach based on Whi is to say
8413.2 unless you're having hot flashes and
8415.12 night sweats that are severe I'm not
8416.979 going to give you hormone therapy and I
8418.479 I just want to call that out I would say
8420.16 no that is not the way to approach it
8423.34 further
8426.82 the concept right now in conventional
8428.859 medicine is that hot flashes and night
8430.66 sweats are these nuisance symptoms that
8432.52 we will take care of temporarily maybe
8435.16 with a little bit of estrogen
8436.66 progesterone or birth control pill
8438.28 because it's given a lot or that they
8440.02 pass or is that this idea you know suck
8442.359 it up suck it up
8444.04 doesn't matter that you're not sleeping
8445.66 anymore you know turn down the
8447.76 temperature in your room
8449.439 and that's not right because
8452.08 hot flashes and night sweats are a
8454.359 biomarker
8455.74 of cardiometabolic disease they are a
8457.899 biomarker of increased bone loss
8461.26 they are a biomarker of changes in the
8463.6 brain
8464.62 so many of these symptoms that occur in
8467.02 perimenopause are not driven by the
8469.24 ovaries they are driven by the brain
8471.46 yeah it's the the bi-directional
8473.859 crosstalk between the body and the brain
8476.2 keeps you know I think is this
8477.399 resounding theme uh we had Chris Palmer
8479.74 on here a psychiatrist who's talking
8481.359 about ketogenic diet mental health I
8483.399 know uh you we could have a whole other
8485.92 discussion and we will I hope if you'll
8488.14 agree to it about nutrition and as it
8490.899 relates to hormones uh specific diets
8493.42 and and so forth but the and that's a
8495.76 question too whether this problem of
8499.359 cerebral hyper metabolism
8501.46 could we solve it with estrogen
8504.399 and or increased metabolic flexibility
8506.92 so I just wanted to footnote that sorry
8509.62 to interrupt you no please uh please
8511.18 interrupt um uh I know Europe as long as
8514.6 we're there I know you are a fan in some
8516.76 instances of intermittent fasting time
8518.68 restricted feeding and or ketogenic diet
8521.26 yes
8522.58 um to get cells sensitive to insulin
8526.06 which is not to say if I understand
8527.8 correctly which is not to say that women
8530.26 need to stay on the ketogenic diet for
8533.2 long periods of time
8534.52 or intermittent fast for my only time
8536.38 restricted feeding for eight hours or
8537.7 six hours a day but that by increasing
8539.859 you said metabolic flexibility
8542.8 excuse me but by increasing cells
8546.04 sensitivity to insulin and then maybe
8548.26 returning to a more typical eating
8550.06 pattern and periodically switching back
8552.04 and forth that might actually benefit be
8553.78 beneficial do I have that right yeah I
8555.88 love the pulse so I feel like it's much
8558.399 more physiologic than say going on a
8560.74 ketogenic diet and staying there for
8562.359 years all of the data that we have on
8564.58 the ketogenic diet
8566.2 it's pretty Limited in terms of duration
8568.3 you know the the longest players that we
8570.819 have in terms of the data are the focus
8573.819 with epilepsy and that's just a
8575.62 different phenotype so I think in terms
8578.92 of microbiome effects diversity
8580.66 dysbiosis some of those issues we really
8583.479 don't know in terms of long-term effects
8586.06 so I prefer with a ketogenic diet that
8588.939 it's used as an NF1 experiment and that
8591.52 to do it for four weeks maybe you
8593.5 measure biomarkers before and afterwards
8595.78 maybe look at your stool before and
8597.399 afterwards we still haven't talked about
8598.66 stool tests yet but you could measure
8600.819 your fasting insulin and your glucose
8603.46 you could just start there do four weeks
8605.859 of Keto clean keto including vegetables
8608.62 it doesn't have to be 57 a day and then
8611.5 measure it again afterwards
8613.479 since you mentioned a mentioned stool
8615.7 testing yes
8617.56 what what is your recommendation about
8619.899 stool testing
8622.12 so my recommendation this is again in
8624.819 the the field of if you have the
8627.58 disposable income so I usually start
8629.14 with Genova because they've got a good
8631.18 copay system with insurance that's what
8633.88 I typically use so I usually do their
8635.92 one day stool test where you have to go
8638.26 digging through your stool and send it
8641.68 off to the slab that's in North Carolina
8644.38 I usually do the one day unless I'm
8646.24 concerned about parasites in that case I
8648.52 tend to do three days I do that for
8649.96 people who travel a fair amount and go
8651.939 to places where there's greater risk or
8653.92 they just have gut symptoms
8656.92 another test that I do a lot is
8659.74 um because I always like to mention two
8661.06 Labs is a test by longevity
8664.54 and this is much more of a data wonk
8667.72 uh type of test because it's powered by
8670.42 AI it was designed by
8673.0 um
8673.78 a guy who's got inflammatory bowel
8676.3 disease and he is a
8680.02 um he's a PhD
8682.18 deep phenotyping bioinformatics guy who
8685.72 wanted to make this really easy
8688.06 so the test is is Under the Umbrella of
8690.939 thorn
8692.2 and
8693.52 um they just call it got bio they might
8695.02 have another name for it and they just
8696.52 improved it so that it's just a wipe
8699.04 instead of digging through her stool and
8701.38 so my athletes will do it now they were
8703.3 not so into digging through their stool
8705.16 before is anybody really no one is I
8708.34 don't want the answer
8709.74 I know the answer I prefer to that but
8712.84 that's a super interesting test because
8714.64 it's
8716.5 you get much more dense data the issue
8719.92 is
8720.88 um with apologies to my friends at
8722.62 Thorne the issue is that there are
8725.38 recommendations end up being sworn
8727.359 supplements so that can be very easy for
8729.939 people who want to you know connect the
8732.46 dots
8734.439 that's not always the way that I like to
8736.24 do it uh first of all
8739.3 three things
8741.34 um
8742.12 you've shared with us an immense amount
8744.34 of knowledge and
8747.22 in that first statement I also want to
8749.439 apologize because I threw at you the
8750.939 entire life span of uh female lifespan
8754.0 reproductive Health contraception diet
8756.76 uh microbiome so many things but
8759.939 um I first I just want to say
8762.1 you've taught me a tremendous amount
8764.62 um
8765.7 including I think something that most
8768.52 people including myself have not thought
8770.68 about enough which is the psychosocial
8773.08 impact on things that we're all familiar
8776.26 with
8777.1 constipation bowel movements what we eat
8779.979 what we avoid I have to say really a
8783.819 huge thank you for that because
8786.7 it's not something that's been discussed
8788.2 on this podcast before sort of know that
8790.359 brain communicates with body psychology
8792.7 and biology are linked but I think this
8794.38 is the first time that anyone's ever
8795.76 directly linked
8798.359 circumstances and biology and psychology
8801.04 in such a concrete way so that's that's
8803.5 the first thing and I speak for many
8805.54 people in that second of all
8808.18 we barely scratched the surface of your
8810.28 knowledge and um which is both uh
8813.1 frustrating for me because uh it I
8816.22 always want to learn more and I know
8817.3 many other people do as well but also
8819.16 very very exciting because uh with uh
8821.26 hopefully without much persuasion we can
8822.76 have you back on to talk about something
8824.319 at all like meant uh I know you're
8826.96 working with men now Men's Health
8829.18 um some particulars around I think
8831.399 there's more for us to explore in terms
8833.8 of PCOS menopause contraception and all
8836.2 of the above but then something that you
8837.819 and I were talking about off camera
8839.8 um before we started which I think is a
8842.08 really important factor that ties back
8844.12 to this issue of of
8845.979 trauma and stress and the bi-directional
8849.58 relationship between biology and
8850.96 psychology hopefully someday we won't
8852.58 even separate those two
8854.22 which is the use of specific medicines
8857.439 including plant medicines yes and how
8859.78 that can influence overall health which
8861.58 no doubt will include Hormone Health
8863.8 so I say all of that for two reasons
8866.439 first of all to queue up the
8868.3 we won't even call it a part two but a
8870.1 sequel to the to this with
8872.5 um I'm gratified to hear that you you'll
8874.18 join us for that and then also to just
8876.399 really extend a huge thank you the
8878.14 amount of knowledge that you shared is
8879.88 is immense and uh is going to be very
8883.54 very useful and actionable for for men
8886.6 in terms of their thinking and their
8888.58 actions and
8890.38 for women in particular today's
8892.359 discussion in particular for women in
8894.58 terms of how to think about their health
8896.02 and biology how to think about their
8897.52 psychology and the environment that all
8899.08 of that's embedded in so I just want to
8900.88 say an enormous thank
8902.92 you thank you Andrew I so appreciate
8904.899 that and I so appreciate
8906.88 what you offer to the world in terms of
8909.46 a weigh-in a way to understand
8911.62 physiology and how to craft a architect
8915.04 a better life
8917.439 um can I just add one last thing because
8919.899 I didn't talk about it since we didn't
8921.64 get to the 40s and the 50s and those
8923.62 listed biomarkers so I feel like if
8927.16 people if women went away with one thing
8929.62 today it would be to do a coronary
8932.2 artery calcium score
8934.12 by age 45 and sooner if you've got
8936.76 premature heart disease how is that
8938.5 taken so it's a CT scan of the chest
8941.979 you can self-order it like I think at
8943.96 Stanford Hospital you can self-order it
8945.88 last time a patient checked it was 250
8948.04 so again disposable income but it it
8951.58 tells you it it almost gives you this
8953.74 fork in the road in terms of how much
8956.14 you need to pay attention to
8957.1 cardiometabolic health as a woman and
8959.74 it's uh 45 for men too so if you haven't
8962.92 had one if you had one no you need one
8965.76 insulin cortisol CAC great so I'll run
8969.7 all that by you it's really essential
8971.56 and it's um
8974.859 yeah it's it's so fascinating because
8978.04 you know there's some women who have a
8979.84 zero so my score is zero and that's
8981.88 great so often you can just keep doing
8983.8 what you're doing but if you're 45 and
8986.68 you're starting to be elevated or you've
8989.62 got you know maybe you've got PCOS or
8991.72 you've got some other biomarkers tending
8994.18 you in this direction toward the number
8995.8 one killer really
8998.14 it's nine out of the top 10 killers in
9000.84 the US
9002.399 that allows you to really start to make
9004.62 changes and I I think it's essential to
9007.439 know that data it's not it's probably
9009.6 not going to be offered by your doctor
9011.46 certainly Peter attia is going to offer
9013.319 it but most conventional doctors are not
9015.54 going to do it and then the last thing I
9017.16 want to say before you mention so if I
9019.08 were to go to my doctor and I just say I
9020.52 want a cardiac calcium score that's what
9022.8 people coronary artery calcium scores
9025.02 CAC okay so everyone hear that and know
9029.16 that if you're 40 or older and maybe if
9030.84 you're 45 45 or older get get it
9034.5 so the last thing is and this is for men
9036.6 and women is there a score
9039.3 so adverse childhood experiences knowing
9042.96 your a score is so essential in terms of
9045.899 a baseline for how much trauma your
9048.84 system your Pine system endured when you
9051.24 were a kid and we know that childhood
9054.06 trauma whether it's abuse or neglect or
9057.899 you know having an alcoholic parent that
9060.6 maps to disease in middle age and it can
9063.42 give you so much Insight I'll give you
9064.979 an example I've got a patient who had an
9067.2 elevated coronary artery calcium score
9069.0 who does everything right with her food
9071.16 I think it was her trauma that elevated
9073.68 her CAC when she was 45. so I think an a
9078.18 score knowing your a score
9080.939 starting as a teenager like knowing it
9083.34 and knowing how to work with that is
9085.56 really essential there are certain
9087.24 people they are exceedingly rare but you
9089.76 are one such person that when they speak
9091.5 knowledge just comes from comes out of
9094.14 them and it's incredibly useful and
9096.06 helpful knowledge so thank you I'm gonna
9097.74 get both of those things good
9099.78 um and I highly recommend everyone else
9101.939 pursue ways that they can get those or
9103.74 if they can't get them that they you
9106.2 know
9106.859 Your Mark those as things to get at the
9109.14 point where they they can obtain
9110.88 sufficient uh disposable income sounds
9113.52 like that the health uh the detriments
9116.939 to health that those can offset would be
9118.8 well worth the cost totally

9240.18 episodes of the huberman lab podcast we
9242.16 discuss supplements while supplements
9244.02 aren't necessary for everybody many
9245.58 people derive tremendous benefit from
9247.02 them for everything from sleep to focus
9248.7 to hormone regulation the huberman Lab
9251.46 podcast is happy to announce that we
9253.08 partnered with momentous supplements
9254.52 because momentous supplements are the
9256.08 absolute highest quality also they
9258.72 include many single ingredient
9259.8 formulations which is essential if you
9261.78 wanted to design a supplement regimen
9263.28 that is both cost effective and the most
9265.38 biologically effective supplement
9266.939 regimen that's very hard to do with
9268.979 blends of supplements it's very
9270.6 straightforward to do with single
9271.859 ingredient formulations also momentous
9274.439 supplements ship internationally which
9276.0 is important because we realize that
9277.26 many of you reside outside of the United
9279.0 States if you'd like to see the
9280.439 supplements discussed on the huberman
9281.58 Lab podcast you can go to live momentous
9284.22 spelled ous so that's livemomentis.com
9287.06 huberman thank you once again for
