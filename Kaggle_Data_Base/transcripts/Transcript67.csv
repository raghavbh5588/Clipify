0.36,"- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
1.88,where we discuss science 
3.72,and science-based tools for everyday life. 
6.494,[upbeat music] 
9.27,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.26,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
12.72,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.5,"Today, we are talking all about the science of gratitude. "
17.6,"In part, we're doing this "
18.45,"because of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, "
20.6,"which of course, is all about giving thanks, gratitude, "
23.75,but also because there's no a wealth of data 
26.01,showing that having an effective gratitude practice 
29.061,can impact a huge number of health variables; 
32.88,both mental health and physical health in positive ways. 
36.1,"Things like cardiovascular health, "
37.53,"things like relationships, things like mental health, "
40.55,things like physical and cognitive performance. 
42.76,And these are not small effects. 
44.13,These are very large positive effects. 
46.91,"However, in researching this episode, "
48.75,I was completely surprised 
50.06,as to what constitutes an effective gratitude practice. 
54.73,"I, I think like many of you, would have thought "
56.8,that an effective gratitude practice 
58.21,simply involves writing down a few things 
60.44,"or many things that we're grateful for, "
62.23,or thinking about those. 
63.72,Or really making an effort to somaticize 
67.55,or feel some of the elements of gratitude 
70.9,while writing out that list or thinking about that list. 
73.73,It turns out that an effective gratitude practice 
76.55,doesn't resemble that at all. 
78.33,"The neuroimaging data, the physiological data, "
80.67,"looking at things like inflammatory markers, other studies, "
84.52,purely looking at the psychology and the long 
87.02,"and short-term effects of an effective gratitude practice, "
89.96,point to a completely different approach to using gratitude 
93.4,to positively impact health metrics. 
95.87,"Fortunately, these are things "
96.83,that we can all do very easily. 
98.71,Some of them were actually fun. 
101.07,You can do them in a variety of contexts. 
103.0,So today we're going to talk about the science 
104.68,"of effective gratitude practices, "
106.76,and we're going to describe what those are 
108.31,and how you can incorporate them into your life. 
110.72,"Before we dive into today's topic, "
112.32,I just want to highlight 
113.48,a particularly interesting set of findings 
115.24,from the literature. 
116.63,"This is a study that came out in the journal Cell Report, "
118.99,"Cell Press journal, excellent journal. "
120.81,It's very relevant to today's topic. 
122.97,"In fact, we're going to spend more time with this paper "
124.76,a little bit later in the episode. 
126.72,The study involved having subjects listen to a story. 
131.636,"The subjects are all listening to the same story, "
134.81,but those subjects are not listening to it together. 
136.87,"They're not rounded up in a circle or all in a room, "
139.26,they're in separate rooms 
140.19,"or entirely separate locations on the planet, "
143.57,or they are actually brought into the laboratory 
146.18,on separate days. 
148.01,What this study found is that different subjects 
151.89,"listening to the same story, "
154.0,undergo the same variation in heart rate. 
158.53,"In other words, the gaps between their heartbeats "
161.18,start to resemble one another in response to the same story. 
165.02,"Now, this is very interesting. "
166.35,This is a coordination of the physiology of the body 
170.69,"in response to a narrative, a story in different people. "
174.6,And yet when they line up the heart rates 
177.04,of these different people who listen to the story 
179.15,"at completely different times, "
180.66,they find that those heart rates 
182.06,map onto one another almost identically. 
184.63,It's really remarkable. 
186.314,We're going to talk about what this means 
188.33,in terms of coordination of neural circuits in the brain 
191.18,"and neural circuits in the body, "
192.67,"and the organs such as the heart, "
194.46,"but also the lungs and other organs of the body, "
196.4,and what this means for changing one's overall state. 
200.09,A key theme that's going to come up today again and again 
203.17,"is the distinction between traits, "
205.88,which are kind of pervasive aspects of who we are 
209.67,and how we tend to react 
210.7,"to different types of circumstances, "
212.7,"and states, which are more transient. "
214.81,"They tend to, you know, you can invoke a state in somebody, "
217.63,a state of fear or a state of relaxation. 
220.1,But what this study really starts to point to 
222.62,is that there are specific approaches 
224.35,that any of us can take 
225.74,"in order to really rewire our nervous system, "
228.69,"such that we are calmer, if we want to be calmer "
231.53,"in certain circumstances, "
232.93,"that we are more responsive in certain circumstances, "
235.61,if that's our goal. 
236.67,So we'll return to how one would go about doing that. 
238.87,But I think these results are just beautiful 
241.57,in the sense that they really show 
243.35,that our brain and our body are highly coordinated 
245.42,because people are listening to the story 
246.607,"and the heart rate is changing in response to the story, "
250.36,but that there is what we call a stereotypy; 
254.27,sort of stereotyped response to a given story. 
257.6,"In my mind, there was no reason "
258.79,why the results had to be this way. 
260.61,"Two people listen to the same story, "
261.99,why should their heart rates be almost identical 
263.9,to the same story? 
265.01,"Very, very interesting and points to the power of narrative "
268.02,and story in coordinating our physiology. 
270.95,And this is something powerful that we can leverage. 
273.03,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
275.38,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
277.97,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
279.94,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
282.61,and science related tools to the general public. 
285.42,"And keeping with that theme, "
286.39,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
289.21,Our first sponsor is ROKA. 
291.07,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses 
293.11,that are of the absolute highest quality. 
295.41,"I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system, "
297.44,and I can tell you that the visual system 
298.78,has a number of important features 
300.47,"that allow you to see things with crystal clarity, "
302.58,no matter what environment you're in. 
304.46,So that means if you're in bright sunlight 
306.16,"or you go into shadows, "
307.52,you should be able to see everything clearly. 
309.32,But many eyeglasses and sunglasses 
311.32,"actually short circuit that feature of our visual system, "
313.88,"and make it such that we have to take off our glasses, "
315.9,"or if our screen dims, "
317.13,we feel like we can't see things quite right. 
319.12,ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses 
320.98,have completely solved that problem. 
322.94,"In addition, they're very lightweight, "
324.41,so you don't even remember that they're on your face. 
326.48,"And if you get sweaty, they don't slip off. "
328.66,They were actually designed for cycling and running 
331.38,"and things of that sort, but they have a terrific aesthetic. "
333.52,"So I wear readers at night or out to dinner, "
335.76,"or when I'm driving, I wear their sunglasses. "
337.93,"And the aesthetics are really terrific, "
339.21,even though they're so-called performance glasses. 
340.94,"'Cause as many of you know, "
342.34,performance glasses often make people look like cyborgs. 
344.73,These sunglasses and eyeglasses have the kind of aesthetic 
347.18,that you can wear them anywhere; 
348.27,"while cycling, running, "
349.23,but also doing anything else you might be doing. 
351.57,"If you'd like to try ROKA glasses, you can go to roka.com, "
354.49,that's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman 
357.62,to save 
20%,off your first order. 
359.54,"Again, that's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com, "
361.86,and enter the code Huberman at checkout. 
364.14,Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker. 
367.4,Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
369.92,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
372.38,to help you better meet your immediate 
373.9,and long-term health goals. 
375.87,I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done. 
378.79,For the simple reason that many of the factors 
381.5,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
383.76,can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. 
386.42,"And now, with the advent of modern DNA tests, "
388.88,you can also get insights into your genes 
391.05,and how those affect or should affect your immediate 
393.65,and long-term health choices. 
395.79,A big problem with a lot of blood tests 
397.31,"and DNA tests out there, however, "
399.18,is that you get the data back 
400.55,and you don't know what to do with the data. 
402.36,Inside Tracker has solve that problem 
403.95,"with a very easy to use dashboard, "
406.32,where you get your numbers back from your blood tests 
408.31,"or your DNA tests, "
409.19,"and then it points to specific lifestyle factors, "
412.05,"nutritional factors, and so forth, "
414.07,that can allow you to bring the numbers into the ranges 
416.23,that are optimal for you. 
417.447,And this is a huge advantage over other blood tests 
420.25,and DNA tests out there. 
421.88,Another feature that Inside Tracker has 
423.71,is their InnerAge test. 
425.74,"The InnerAge test shows you what your biological age is, "
428.73,and you can compare that to your chronological age. 
431.37,"And of course, your biological age is equally, "
434.62,if not more important than your chronological age. 
436.93,So this is an important number 
438.22,that you can get from Inside Tracker. 
440.15,"If you'd like to try Inside Tracker, "
441.69,"you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman, "
444.94,to get 
25%,off any of Inside Tracker's plans. 
447.95,And if you're listening to this 
449.866,"during the week of Thanksgiving, "
"2021,",
451.23,"and you live in the United States, "
452.97,you can get a special offer for this week only. 
455.58,You can get $

463.34,"Again, just go to insidetracker.com/huberman. "
466.66,Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon. 
469.55,"Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free, "
472.12,keto-friendly cereal. 
473.89,"Now, I'm not following a ketogenic nutrition plan. "
476.88,What works best for me is to fast until about 
11:,
00,a.m. 
480.22,"or noon most days, and then to eat a low carbohydrate lunch, "
483.51,"a low carbohydrate snack in the afternoon, "
486.09,and in the evening is when I eat my starches. 
488.8,That's what allows me to be alert throughout the day 
490.64,"for work, for exercise and so forth, "
492.49,and then to sleep really well at night. 
494.19,That's just what works for me. 
495.68,"But it does require that throughout the day, "
498.55,I am eating fewer carbohydrates than I am at night. 
501.02,"And oftentimes I want a snack, "
502.61,and the snack I want is usually Magic Spoon. 
505.61,"Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar, "
507.59,
13,to 
14,"grams of protein, "
509.2,and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving. 
512.46,It's absolutely delicious. 
513.8,I particularly like the frosted flavor 
516.67,'cause it tastes like donuts. 
517.7,And then I try not to eat donuts. 
519.67,"No vendetta against donuts, "
520.97,but it's not really compatible with my eating plan. 
523.51,"They also have flavors like cocoa, fruity, peanut butter. "
526.27,They're really delicious. 
527.58,Any ideas you have about keto-friendly cereals 
529.82,"and foods not being delicious, "
531.6,"you have to try Magic Spoon, it'll change your mind. "
533.73,In fact I'm getting hungry just thinking about it right now. 
535.98,"If you want to try Magic Spoon, "
537.19,you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman to get a variety pack. 
541.03,Just use the promo code Huberman at checkout 
543.65,to get $

545.55,"Again, that's magicspoon.com/huberman, "
548.2,and use the code Huberman to get $
5,off. 
551.23,Let's talk about gratitude. 
552.56,"And to begin, I'd like to emphasize the various aspects "
555.04,of mental and physical health 
556.25,that have been shown to benefit 
557.65,from a regular gratitude practice. 
559.89,There are studies showing 
560.81,"that performing a gratitude practice twice or three times, "
565.46,"or even just once a week, can lead to a pervasive, "
568.56,a long lasting impact on subjective wellbeing. 
572.814,"People report feeling happier, more meaning, joy, "
575.91,"even awe for their life experience, "
578.61,simply in response to adding a gratitude practice. 
581.47,The key thing is it has to be the right gratitude practice. 
583.76,And we're going to talk about 
584.64,what the right gratitude practice looks like 
586.522,in just a little bit. 
588.35,But there are additional benefits of a gratitude practice. 
591.675,There are studies showing that a regular gratitude practice 
596.2,"can provide resilience to trauma, in two ways; "
599.75,it can provide a reframing 
601.72,and resilience to prior traumatic experiences. 
604.27,So buffering people 
605.22,against the negative physiological effects 
607.89,"and psychological effects of earlier trauma, "
610.06,but also inoculating them in many ways 
613.01,to any traumas that might arrive later in life. 
616.02,So that's a powerful thing. 
617.7,And today we will talk about 
619.34,how that's actually accomplished. 
620.6,It's actually accomplished by shifting the way 
623.31,that the fear and defense networks 
625.29,in the brain actually function. 
627.39,And we'll get right down into the details of that. 
629.71,The other thing that a gratitude practice does 
631.65,is it's been shown to benefit social relationships. 
634.379,But not just for the relationship 
636.7,"in which you express gratitude, right? "
638.48,"So on the face of it, you might think, "
640.11,"okay, if I express gratitude for somebody over and over, "
642.61,"over and over, over and over, "
643.88,then I'm going to feel better about that person. 
645.56,"And indeed, that is one effect of a gratitude practice. "
648.41,That's called a pro-social 
649.68,or interstitial social gratitude practice. 
651.91,"But there are now several studies, "
654.84,recent studies in good journals pointing to the fact 
657.41,that a regular gratitude practice can also enhance 
660.64,one's social relationships across the board; 
663.2,"in the workplace, at school, at with family "
665.82,"and romantic relationships, "
667.09,"and even one's relationship to themselves, "
668.93,which is really what the subjective feelings 
670.43,of wellbeing are. 
671.55,So it's clear to me that ineffective gratitude practice 
675.29,"has an outsized effect on many, many aspects "
679.28,of mental and physical health. 
680.77,And for those of you 
681.603,"that are coming to this conversation thinking, "
683.82,"gratitude practice, oh, that's kind of wishy-washy or woo, "
686.72,it's going to involve putting your hand on your heart 
688.78,and feeling into all the amazing things 
690.67,"that you happen to have, "
691.56,"even when things are really terrible, "
692.95,that's not where we're going at all. 
695.394,And equally important is to understand 
697.93,"that the neurochemical, the anti-inflammatory "
702.87,and the neural circuit mechanisms that gratitude can invoke 
708.94,"are equally on par with some of the effects of pharmacology, "
713.21,of things like high intensity interval training 
715.15,"and exercise, and other things that we think of "
717.33,as kind of more potent forms of self intervention. 
720.69,So if you are of the mindset that a gratitude practice 
724.15,"is kind of weak sauce, buckle up, "
726.81,because the data actually points to the fact 
728.71,"that a gratitude practice is a very, very potent way "
732.2,in which you can steer your mental and physical health 
734.72,"in positive directions, "
736.4,and that those effects are very long lasting. 
738.92,Before we dive into the tools and mechanisms 
741.02,"and scientific studies around gratitude, "
742.69,I'd like to just set the framework for the discussion. 
745.54,Gratitude is what we call a pro-social behavior 
748.16,or a pro-social mindset. 
750.64,"Now, you can be grateful for something "
752.84,without it involving anybody else. 
754.92,So the social part isn't meant to convey anything 
757.45,"about interpersonal relations, although it can. "
759.63,And today we're going to talk a lot about 
761.07,how interpersonal relations can be incorporated 
763.75,into a gratitude practice in really powerful ways. 
766.64,But pro-social behaviors are basically any behavior 
769.57,or mode of thinking that allow us to be more effective 
773.91,"in interactions with other people, including ourselves. "
777.49,Now pro-social is not just a name that we give 
780.38,these different tools and practices and mindsets. 
783.8,They're actually neural circuits in the brain 
786.13,that are specifically wired 
787.94,for pro-social thoughts and behaviors. 
790.23,And these are distinctly different 
791.8,from the circuits in the brain 
793.07,that are involved in defensive behaviors. 
795.47,"So without getting into too much detail, "
797.07,"just yet, we will later, "
799.46,we have circuits in the brain 
800.75,that are what we call appetitive. 
802.69,They are designed to bring us closer to things 
805.0,and to bring us into closer relation 
808.06,to the details of that sensory experience. 
811.06,"Now that could be a delicious food that you're eating, "
813.2,"it could be interacting with a loved one, "
814.84,it could be interacting with a friend 
816.33,"or anyone that you happen to like, "
817.98,it could even be in your relation to yourself. 
819.98,These circuits that we're calling pro-social circuits 
822.55,"light up in the brain in neuroimaging, "
824.61,"meaning the neurons are firing more actively, "
826.72,more electrically robustly; 
829.425,sort of like turning up the volume 
831.75,on these neural circuits in the brain. 
833.7,And the neural circuits in the brain 
835.4,that are associated with aversive or defensive behaviors; 
839.43,"things like backing up things, "
840.77,"like covering up the vital organs of the body, "
842.73,"things like a quaking of the voice, "
844.76,all of the things are associated with defensive behaviors 
847.46,"are actually antagonized, meaning they are reduced "
850.76,when the pro-social circuits are more active. 
853.82,So the framework here that I'd like to set 
855.73,is that we have this kind of seesaw 
857.43,of neural circuits in the brain. 
858.95,One set that are pro-social and are designed 
861.81,"to bring us closer to others, including ourselves, "
864.94,"closer to certain sensory experiences, right? "
867.46,Because a lot of pro-social behaviors 
869.18,"can also be geared towards things like pets or food, "
872.46,or anything that we find we want to be closer to 
875.11,and want more of. 
876.17,"Whereas the defensive circuits involve areas of the brain, "
879.87,"yes, such as areas that are involved in fear, "
882.51,but also areas of the brain and body 
884.92,that are literally associated with freezing 
886.89,or with backing up. 
888.2,So the way to think about gratitude 
889.91,"is that falls under this category of pro-social behaviors, "
892.53,which are designed 
893.363,"to bring us closer to different types of things, "
896.75,and to enhance the level of detail 
899.92,that we extract from those experiences. 
902.34,"Now, the existence of these two neuro circuits "
904.75,"that I've placed on this sort of a metaphorical seesaw, "
908.57,"if you will, "
910.75,runs counter to a lot of the messaging or the ideas 
914.57,that were put forth in the last century 
917.21,"about the psychology of happiness and gratitude, "
920.98,versus the psychology of depression and struggle 
926.04,and concern about the future. 
928.468,"In fact, I'd like to read a quote from the great, "
930.41,"and we really should call him the great Sigmund Freud, "
933.4,because despite having certain traits 
937.85,"that people criticize him of, "
940.18,Freud was indeed a genius 
942.07,about many aspects of psychology. 
943.86,But I just want to read you Freud's stance on happiness. 
948.41,And this invokes elements of gratitude as well. 
951.11,And then you can gauge for yourself. 
954.445,"""Our possibilities of happiness are already restricted "
958.1,"by our constitution."" "
959.65,So he's saying that we're basically wired 
961.35,to not have happiness easily. 
963.857,"""Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience. "
966.39,We are threatened with suffering from three directions; 
968.93,"one from our own body, "
970.48,"which is doomed to decay and disillusion, "
972.797,and which cannot even do without pain 
975.25,and anxiety as warning signals. 
977.14,"Two, from the external world, "
978.98,which may rage against us with overwhelming 
981.08,and merciless forces of destruction. 
983.08,"And three and finally, from our relations with others, "
986.73,the suffering of which from this last source 
988.93,"is perhaps more painful to us than any other."" "
992.34,That's Sigmund Freud. 
993.63,"And not all of his writings were pessimistic, if you will. "
998.122,What Freud is referring to there 
1000.018,are those defensive circuits. 
1002.42,"And of course, he talks about psychological defensives. "
1004.96,"And in full disclosure, I am a huge fan "
1008.12,of much of the psychological literature 
1010.577,"and psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud and his descendants, "
1015.16,like Young and others. 
1016.38,I think there are strong elements of truth there. 
1018.67,But he gives you a sense of the kind of mindset 
1020.64,of psychology early in the last century. 
1023.444,"And then of course, was the emergence "
1025.23,"of the positive psychology movement, "
1026.93,which was really about invoking the understanding 
1030.167,and eventually the elucidation of the neural circuits 
1034.35,for things like happiness and awe and affiliation 
1037.44,and things that we are calling pro-social circuits. 
1040.07,"So the field of psychology as a dark and light, if you will, "
1044.24,and the field of neuroscience has a dark and light. 
1047.31,We have these what we call parallel pathways in the brain. 
1050.35,And we have parallel pathways in the mind 
1052.27,that set us up for feeling good about things 
1054.34,or for feeling less good about things. 
1056.67,I think what's really salient from the quote from Freud 
1058.9,is that what he's saying is our default 
1061.61,"is to be concerned about the future, "
1063.73,"to be wrapped in our defenses, "
1066.61,and to some extent that's true. 
1068.215,And the reason we can say that's true 
1070.71,is because most of us need a gratitude practice. 
1075.34,We need to do certain things 
1076.84,in order to feel good and to feel happy. 
1079.55,We actually have to put work into it. 
1081.29,It is quite possible that there's an asymmetry 
1084.1,in the way that these pro-social 
1085.74,"versus defensive circuits are set up, "
1088.12,such that because defensive circuits 
1090.71,"are designed to keep us safe, "
1092.22,"psychologically and physically safe, "
1093.87,"that they have more robustness, "
1096.28,or they can actually drive our behavior more easily. 
1099.22,I'll give you an analogy in the system 
1101.29,"that I'm most familiar with as a neuroscientist, "
1103.34,which is the visual system. 
1104.74,"In the visual system, we have parallel pathways. "
1107.237,We have neurons in our eye that respond 
1110.59,when things in our environment get brighter. 
1112.71,"Literally when the lights go up, "
1114.36,these neurons start firing like crazy. 
1116.39,And we have neurons in our eye 
1117.77,"that respond when things get darker, "
1119.59,when things start dimming or go from white to black. 
1123.178,The circuits for detecting darkening are much more robust 
1128.36,and much more numerous than are the circuits for brightness. 
1131.28,"And that is probably related, probably, "
1134.08,"to the fact that dark objects or experiencing looming, "
1140.13,meaning incoming objects and being able to perceive them 
1143.64,is something that's vital to our survival. 
1145.93,Whereas being able to perceive the brightening of things 
1148.86,might be important to survival in certain contexts; 
1151.2,a car lights coming at you at night 
1152.43,"or something of that sort, "
1153.66,but not as often in a kind of a evolutionary 
1156.81,or ecological context as the darkening of things. 
1159.57,"So, I think Freud's quote and the field of psychology "
1163.05,now point to the fact that indeed we have 
1167.14,the capacity for happiness and we have the capacity 
1169.56,for great worry and concern and depression and unhappiness. 
1173.51,And the neural circuit literature also supports that. 
1176.96,The key thing for today's discussion 
1179.01,is that gratitude turns out to be 
1181.97,one of the most potent wedges 
1183.82,"by which we can insert our thinking, "
1186.29,"and as you also see, the physiology of our body, "
1189.5,"between these two circuits, "
1191.02,"and give a little more levity, if you will, "
1194.17,to the side of the seesaw 
1195.38,that's associated with positive pro-social feelings. 
1199.44,"And if you keep imagining this seesaw imagery, "
1203.79,what's really beautiful about gratitude practices 
1206.31,"is that if they're performed repeatedly, "
1209.07,"and not even that often, but repeatedly, "
1211.67,then one can actually shift their neural circuits 
1214.86,such that the seesaw that I'm calling pro-social 
1217.54,"versus defensive behaviors, can actually start to tilt. "
1220.25,"And the little hinge, if you will, "
1221.72,on the seesaw in the middle can be adjusted 
1223.76,in a little tighter when the side for gratitude 
1228.61,and for wellbeing and for feelings of happiness 
1231.39,is a little bit higher. 
1232.85,"What this means is that, "
1234.245,"whether or not Freud was right or wrong, "
1235.94,whether or not the neuroscientists 
1238.35,"in one camp or another were right or wrong, "
1240.34,we now know with certainty that a regular gratitude practice 
1243.71,can shift the pro-social circuit 
1245.69,so that they dominate our physiology and our mindset 
1249.35,"in ways that can enhance many, many aspects "
1252.47,of our physical and mental health by default. 
1254.89,So we don't always have to constantly be in practice 
1257.37,trying to be happy. 
1258.95,"So the succinct way of saying all this is, "
1261.306,"yes, indeed, we might be wired "
1263.49,or in such that we have a greater propensity 
1267.3,for unhappiness than happiness. 
1269.29,But gratitude practices provided they are the effective ones 
1272.97,"and they're performed regularly, can shift those circuits, "
1277.36,"such that we are happier on average, "
1279.8,even when we are not performing those practices. 
1282.28,Now I'd like to talk about some of the neurochemistry 
1284.587,and neural circuits associated with gratitude 
1287.62,and pro-social behaviors. 
1289.71,"Numerous times on this podcast, "
1291.13,I've talked about so-called neuromodulators. 
1293.57,For those of you that might've forgotten 
1295.28,"or have never heard of neuromodulators before, "
1297.5,neuromodulators are chemicals 
1298.81,that are released in the brain and body 
1300.9,that change the activity of other neural circuits. 
1303.68,They make certain brain areas more likely to be active 
1306.87,and other brain areas less likely to be active. 
1310.6,"These neuromodulators have names like dopamine, serotonin, "
1313.02,"acetylcholine, epinephrin, and so on. "
1316.19,The main neuromodulators associated with gratitude 
1319.01,and pro-social behaviors tends to be serotonin. 
1322.49,Serotonin is released 
1323.89,from a very small collection of neurons in the brainstem 
1328.85,"called the raphe, R-A-P-H-E, the raphe nucleus, "
1332.7,and a few other places in the brain. 
1334.25,And the raphe neuron send these little wires 
1336.76,that we call axons out to numerous places in the brain. 
1340.08,And they tend to increase the activity 
1342.19,of particular neurocircuits that lend themselves 
1345.91,to more approach to particular types of experiences. 
1350.88,That makes total sense if you think about it. 
1353.2,Have a chemical that under certain circumstances 
1356.08,"is released in the brain, "
1357.52,"that triggers the activity of neural circuits, "
1360.6,"that makes the organism, you, "
1362.94,"more likely to stay in an interaction with something, "
1366.46,or even lean in and seek a more detailed interaction 
1369.78,"with that person, place or thing. "
1372.311,Beautiful work from a cognitive neuropsychologist. 
1377.09,His name is Antonio Demasio. 
1379.14,He's a world-class neuroscientists. 
1382.44,Has been in the game a very long time. 
1384.24,Has explored the so-called neural correlates of gratitude. 
1387.46,And two main brain areas are activated 
1391.09,by these serotonergic systems. 
1393.45,And when people experience something 
1395.99,"that makes them feel gratitude, "
1398.49,"even if it's shallow gratitude or deep, "
1400.89,"and if it's all the way to deep gratitude, "
1402.99,they see activation of these particular brain circuits 
1405.62,I'll mention in a moment. 
1406.55,And the amount of activation scales 
1408.76,with how intensely the person experience 
1411.63,the feeling of gratitude. 
1413.54,And those two areas have particular names. 
1415.5,"You don't need to know the names, "
1416.57,"but for those of you that want to know, "
1417.87,they are the anterior cingulate cortex 
1419.96,and the medial prefrontal cortex. 
1421.91,"And of course, these brain areas are connected "
1423.38,to a number of other networks in the brain. 
1425.47,"In fact, that's how they get you or others "
1428.59,to lean into certain experiences. 
1430.635,"Because when these areas are active, "
1433.44,certain thought processes get invoked. 
1436.08,"Those thought processes probably resemble something like, "
1439.02,"hmm, I'd like to experience more of this, "
1441.06,"or hmm, this feels really good. "
1442.52,And then they literally feed onto your muscles 
1446.62,"via the neurons, making you happy to stay stationary, "
1450.9,"if you're experiencing something you like, "
1452.35,or to move closer to something 
1454.14,that you find attractive to you literally. 
1457.73,So these are powerful circuits. 
1459.62,"Of these two brain areas, "
1460.95,the one I'd like to focus on the most 
1462.76,is the medial prefrontal cortex. 
1465.536,Many of you have probably heard 
1466.84,"of the medial prefrontal cortex, "
1468.57,because this is the area of the brain 
1470.429,that is involved in planning and in deep thinking 
1475.18,"and evaluation of different types of experiences, "
1477.79,"past, present, or future. "
1479.523,It seems actually that pretty much every study 
1482.44,of human anything seems to involve 
1484.4,"the medial prefrontal cortex, "
1485.7,or at least one could get that impression 
1487.78,just by looking at scientific abstracts 
1489.47,and papers these days. 
1491.188,"So I think it's worth us taking a step back and asking, "
1493.93,"what is the medial prefrontal cortex really do, right? "
1497.26,How could this one piece of neural real estate 
1499.61,"that we all have right behind our forehead, "
1501.76,how could that be involved in so many different things? 
1504.11,And the reason it can be involved 
1505.59,"in so many different things, "
1506.62,and the reason it's especially important for gratitude 
1509.26,"is that medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay? "
1513.65,It sets context and it literally defines 
1516.97,the meaning of your experience. 
1519.34,Now this is not at all an abstract phenomenon. 
1521.69,"I'm going to give a very physiological example of this, "
1525.442,and then we're going to translate to gratitude. 
1527.84,"But I really want everyone to understand, "
1529.89,how is it that medial prefrontal cortex 
1532.21,sets the context of everything in your life? 
1535.79,"Well, it does it the following way. "
1537.51,You have a number of circuits deeper in your brain 
1540.46,"that simply create some sensations or they allow you, "
1544.16,"I should say, to perceive certain sensations. "
1546.61,"Let's use the example of cold exposure, "
1549.18,"something that we'd sometimes talk about in this podcast, "
1551.18,for other reasons. 
1552.542,"If you were to deliberately place yourself into an ice bath, "
1557.25,"it would be uncomfortable, "
1558.68,even if you're adapted to cold and so forth. 
1562.474,The discomfort is non-negotiable. 
1565.78,"However, if you are doing it because you want to, "
1569.03,or because you have knowledge 
1570.64,"that there are particular health benefits, "
1573.92,the medial prefrontal cortex 
1577.33,"can then control areas of your deeper brain, "
1579.98,"like the hypothalamus, to positively impact "
1583.18,the neurochemicals that are released into your system. 
1585.48,You'll still get a lot of adrenaline 
1587.17,by getting into the ice bath. 
1588.84,"But the fact that you are doing this deliberately, "
1591.93,"and your knowledge that you are making the choice, "
1594.42,that it's you that's deciding to put yourself 
1596.43,"through this discomfort, "
1598.51,has been shown to create a very different 
1601.89,"and positive effect on things like dopamine, "
1605.29,"on things like anti-inflammatory markers, "
1608.23,"in your immune system, et cetera, "
1609.78,"compared to if someone pushes you into an ice bath, "
1613.7,or if you are doing it because someone insists 
1616.43,"that you do it and you really, really don't want to. "
1618.82,So there's a very subtle distinction here. 
1620.83,"It's just the distinction of motivation and desire, "
1624.97,or lack of motivation and being forced into something. 
1627.72,And there are a number of other effects of this 
1629.383,that have been described. 
1630.85,In the episode with Robert Sapolsky 
1633.24,"that I did earlier this last year, "
1635.29,"he talked about a study in animals, "
1637.27,which has also been shown in humans. 
1638.64,"If you take a mouse for instance, "
1640.4,"and it runs on a running wheel, "
1642.03,"which mice really like to do, "
1643.83,"there are many positive effects on reducing blood pressure, "
1646.45,"improvements in neurochemistry, et cetera, in that mouse. "
1649.53,"However, if there's a mouse in the cage right next to it "
1652.91,that's trapped in the running wheel 
1654.24,and it has to run every time the other mouse runs 
1657.3,"'cause the wheels are linked, "
1658.68,"well, then the second mouse that's forced to do "
1661.36,the exact same running experiences negative shifts 
1665.52,in their overall health metrics. 
1666.71,"Blood pressure goes up, stress hormones go up, et cetera, "
1669.34,because it's not actually making the choice. 
1671.54,"Medial prefrontal cortex is the knob, "
1674.7,"or the switch rather, that can take one experience "
1678.75,and allow us to frame it 
1681.12,such that it creates positive health effects. 
1684.02,And the exact same experience 
1685.87,"framed as something we don't want to do, "
1688.17,or that we are forced to do 
1689.58,can create negative health effects. 
1691.66,Now how exactly the neurons and medial prefrontal cortex 
1694.51,"do that is rather complicated, "
1696.4,and frankly not completely understood. 
1698.62,But it's somehow able to adjust 
1700.68,the activity of other neural circuits 
1702.21,that are purely reflexive. 
1703.43,"As we say, neuroscience, like really dumb neural circuits, "
1705.77,"they're just like switches, and place a context onto it. "
1709.44,"So, gratitude is a mindset "
1714.22,"that activates prefrontal cortex, "
1717.81,and in doing so sets the context of your experience 
1721.44,such that you can derive tremendous health benefits. 
1724.64,Which leads us to the question; 
1726.21,what kind of gratitude practice 
1728.81,"is going to accomplish this, right? "
1730.69,"Because it is not simply the case that I could take a knife, "
1733.13,"don't please, don't do this experiment, "
1734.42,"and cut my hand and say, oh, you know, I'm going to enjoy this. "
1738.74,I'm doing this 'cause this is good for me and it won't hurt. 
1741.82,"Of course it'll hurt, "
1742.653,"just like the ice bath is cold, no matter what. "
1745.141,"But I can't lie to myself, right? "
1748.56,"If I have some knowledge that cutting myself is bad for me, "
1752.95,that's very hard to override. 
1754.8,"And so, the medial prefrontal cortex "
1757.28,has a tremendous capacity to set context. 
1759.968,And it does that beautifully with respect to gratitude. 
1763.29,But you can't simply lie to yourself. 
1765.32,"You can't simply say, oh, well, every experience "
1768.07,"is a learning experience, "
1769.47,"or a terrible thing happens, oh, good, "
1773.42,"I'm just going to say good, "
1774.86,and that your body will react as if it's good for you. 
1777.59,That's a myth. 
1778.57,"And frankly, it's a myth that's fairly pervasive "
1781.36,in the self-help and self-actualization literature. 
1785.01,We have the opportunity to reframe and set context 
1787.78,on our experiences. 
1789.03,But that requires a very specific set of practices. 
1791.89,"We can't simply lie to ourselves or quote unquote, "
1794.21,fake it until we make it. 
1795.81,Neural circuitry is very powerful and very plastic. 
1798.47,"It can be modified and it's very context-dependent, "
1801.67,but it's not stupid. 
1802.83,And when you lie to yourself about whether 
1805.36,"or not an experience is actually good for you or not, "
1809.61,your brain knows. 
1811.38,So what does an effective gratitude practice look like? 
1815.02,"Well, let's examine what an ineffective, "
1818.71,what a poor gratitude practice looks like. 
1821.43,"Because therein lies some really important information, "
1825.12,"including the fact that I, "
1826.69,and I think millions of other people out there 
1828.959,are doing it wrong. 
1831.428,Most gratitude practices that you see online 
1834.3,and that people talk about in various talks and so forth 
1838.07,"involves something like writing down or reciting, "
1842.42,or thinking about five or 
10,or three or 
20,things 
1846.483,that you're especially grateful for. 
1848.96,"And then really trying to feel into some of those, "
1852.14,"really try and think deeply about the emotions, "
1856.14,"the sensations, the perceptions that are associated "
1859.32,"with those particular people, "
1860.65,places and things on your list. 
1864.22,Most studies actually point to the fact that 
1868.53,that style of gratitude practice 
1870.85,is not particularly effective in shifting 
1873.7,"your neural circuitry, your neural chemistry, "
1876.3,"or your somatic circuitry, the circuits in your body, "
1879.51,'cause you literally have organs and neural circuits 
1881.45,"that are connected, "
1882.58,the circuits of your brain and body 
1884.35,"toward enhanced activation of prefrontal cortex, "
1888.34,enhanced activation of these pro-social neural networks 
1891.46,that we were talking about earlier. 
1893.46,"Now that may come as a surprise to many of you, "
1895.76,and certainly came as a surprise to me. 
1899.15,There is some evidence that if there's a shift 
1902.42,in so-called autonomic arousal 
1904.71,"during these gratitude practices, "
1906.98,"these ones that I'm calling ineffective, "
1909.14,that they can be made slightly more effective. 
1911.68,So what do I mean by a shift in autonomic arousal? 
1914.28,"Well, very briefly we have a aspect to our nervous system, "
1918.06,both within our brain and body 
1919.41,that we call the autonomic nervous system. 
1921.86,It's a little bit of a misnomer 
1922.693,because autonomic means automatic. 
1924.69,"And in fact, we can take control "
1926.88,of the autonomic nervous system. 
1928.36,"It has one branch, meaning one set of connections "
1931.88,"and circuits that are associated with making us more alert, "
1934.61,"the so-called sympathetic nervous system, "
1937.683,or I should say sympathetic arm 
1939.52,"of the autonomic nervous system, "
1940.63,but that's really a mouthful. 
1941.85,It's really associated with enhanced alertness of any kind 
1945.31,"for excitement or fear, "
1946.93,and it has nothing to do with sympathy. 
1948.52,It's just about enhanced alertness. 
1950.09,And then the other arm of the autonomic nervous system 
1952.97,is the so-called parasympathetic arm 
1956.454,of the autonomic nervous system. 
1957.287,But that's also a mouthful. 
1958.28,So let's just say it's the calming aspect 
1961.39,of the autonomic nervous system. 
1962.81,"So it's associated with decreased heart rate, "
1965.17,"decreased breathing rate, et cetera. "
1967.84,"So we have these two aspects, our autonomic nervous system, "
1971.95,and it has been shown that if people are brought 
1974.8,"into a state of heightened sympathetic tone, "
1978.39,"meaning more alertness, "
1980.55,then the intensity of the emotions that they experience 
1983.93,"in their gratitude practice is enhanced, "
1986.43,and the effectiveness of that gratitude practice 
1988.83,can be enhanced. 
1990.64,"This is seen nowadays somewhat commonly as having people, "
1995.05,"for instance, cyclic hyperventilated breathing, "
1998.64,as we call it in my laboratory. 
2000.64,"Breathing that's very intense so that, "
2002.093,"inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale very deeply "
2004.53,for 
25,or 
30,breaths. 
2005.88,"Then people will sit in a meditative stance, "
2007.76,or they'll focus on their notepad and paper. 
2011.41,And they'll write out the things that they're grateful for. 
2013.76,"And then they'll really try and feel into those things, "
2015.98,or they'll think about those things. 
2017.46,And it makes perfect sense 
2018.87,as to why enhancing autonomic arousal 
2021.136,toward more alertness would create more robust feelings 
2026.13,"or more robust impact of the gratitude practices, "
2029.86,"because in that state, you are more alert "
2032.85,"and therefore you are able to bring more detail, "
2035.07,more richness to the perception and the understanding 
2037.89,of what those things on your list happened to be. 
2040.93,And I should say 
2042.55,that there are numerous other approaches to this. 
2045.3,Sort of self-help type stuff 
2046.73,and self actualization seminars. 
2048.54,"People will do things like cold baths, "
2050.61,"or they'll do chanting, "
2051.9,or they'll have any number of different experiences 
2054.51,all of which are mainly geared 
2055.71,towards increased autonomic arousal. 
2058.24,There even practices out there 
2059.47,using pharmacology to create increased autonomic arousal 
2062.29,and then drop into gratitude. 
2064.036,"Across the board, those increase the potency "
2069.01,of the gratitude practice of listing things out on paper 
2071.77,or in one's mind or saying them out loud. 
2074.5,"But somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, "
2077.98,"that form of just expressing thanks, expressing gratitude "
2083.05,is not the most effective way 
2084.9,to shift these pro-social circuits 
2087.17,in positive ways for one's physiology 
2090.14,and anatomy and psychology. 
2093.327,It turns out that the most potent form of gratitude practice 
2097.31,is not a gratitude practice where you give gratitude 
2101.16,"or express gratitude, "
2102.49,"but rather where you receive gratitude, "
2105.43,where you receive thanks. 
2107.07,And this to me was very surprising. 
2109.32,There are a number of studies about this now. 
2111.54,One in particular that I think is interesting is called 
2114.0,Prefrontal activation while listening 
2115.79,to a letter of gratitude read aloud 
2117.61,by a coworker face-to-face: A NIRS study. 
2120.583,N-I-R-S. 
2121.416,I'll explain what all this means. 
2122.6,You now know what the prefrontal activation part is. 
2125.29,This is activation in the prefrontal cortex. 
2127.54,"The NIRS, N-I-R-S study, that's just a technical term. "
2131.74,It's a form of imaging brain activity. 
2135.46,It's noninvasive. 
2136.53,So it's kind of a skullcap. 
2138.69,It looks like a hoodie 
2140.14,"with a bunch of wires coming out of it basically, "
2142.2,that can measure neural activity 
2143.75,without having to remove any parts of the skull 
2146.1,"or put a person into one of these two black fMRI machines, "
2149.51,which is very invasive. 
2150.79,It's also a wonderful tool because it allows human subjects 
2154.44,in the laboratory to move around 
2156.83,and to engage with one another. 
2158.42,"So in this particular experiment, what they did "
2161.25,"is they had co-workers write a letter of gratitude, "
2165.53,"of thanks to another coworker, "
2168.64,unbeknownst to the other coworker. 
2170.11,And then they sat down together 
2172.07,and then they imaged brain activity 
2173.57,as this letter was being read 
2175.01,"and as the letter was being heard, received. "
2177.37,And it showed very robust effects 
2180.7,on these prefrontal networks; 
2182.72,that pointed to the fact that receiving gratitude 
2185.68,"is actually much more potent, "
2187.53,in terms of the positive shifts that that can create 
2189.71,than giving gratitude. 
2191.49,So this raises a couple of important points. 
2193.24,"First of all, if you are somebody who is prone "
2196.53,"to write letters of gratitude, "
2198.95,ideally I think it's requisite 
2201.66,"that these be genuine letters of gratitude, "
2203.5,or saying things that are genuine expressions of gratitude. 
2208.73,This could be by text or in-person or by phone. 
2212.203,You have within you a very potent form 
2214.99,of shifting somebody else's neurology. 
2217.34,"Now, that's wonderful, "
2218.94,and I think there are many people like that out there. 
2221.7,But for many people who want to experience 
2224.97,"the positive effects of gratitude, "
2226.653,it's probably not the most advantageous approach 
2231.04,"to just sit around waiting, "
2232.07,hoping that someone's going to deliver 
2233.7,all these letters or words of gratitude. 
2236.15,How is it that you can create 
2237.81,that sense of receiving gratitude for yourself 
2240.28,and thereby derive the effects of gratitude 
2243.17,as outlined in this particular study? 
2244.97,And there we go back to the important work 
2247.21,of the great Antonio Damasio 
2249.41,"who explored these neural correlates of gratitude, "
2252.06,to define the areas of the brain 
2253.59,that are associated with pro-social behaviors 
2255.41,like the prefrontal cortex. 
2257.075,And what's really interesting about the work 
2260.32,"that Demasio and colleagues did is first of all, "
2262.89,they used functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
2265.53,So this is a very high resolution approach 
2268.61,to exploring what areas of the brain are active. 
2271.41,"And has very high, what we call temporal resolution, "
2273.82,meaning you can see things in time at very fine scales. 
2277.28,"So a lot of mechanistic detail, "
2280.09,it can emerge from these sorts of studies. 
2282.06,What they did was interesting. 
2283.617,"Rather than have people express gratitude, "
2287.67,"they had the subjects go into the scanner, "
2290.7,"so their brains are being imaged, "
2292.22,"and they watched narratives, stories about other people "
2298.16,experiencing positive things in their life. 
2302.05,"And in this case, these were powerful stories. "
2304.65,These were stories about survivors of genocide. 
2307.26,So that's what they're watching. 
2308.56,The subjects were subjects 
2309.83,that were not survivors of genocide. 
2312.2,So they were watching these videotapes 
2314.26,"of people that had genocide, "
2316.93,and had people help them along the way 
2320.92,"as part of their story of survival, "
2323.23,either psychological and/or... 
2324.74,Obviously they survive long enough to make the video. 
2327.14,"So, or physical survival. "
2329.17,"So within these stories, "
2330.89,there was a conveyance of a lot of struggle. 
2334.66,These people talked about the horrible situations 
2336.7,"they were in, but also small, but highly significant "
2341.729,features of their history that had led 
2344.1,to their own feelings of gratitude. 
2346.33,"So for instance, it says a woman at the... "
2349.41,This is literally from the scientific paper. 
2352.05,Somebody had been sick for weeks. 
2354.08,So the woman's describing how she'd been sick for weeks. 
2356.95,And then another prisoner who was a doctor 
2361.43,"finds a particular medicine somehow, "
2363.49,"it doesn't describe how, and literally saves her life. "
2366.58,Or an ally who was also in a stricken circumstance 
2371.96,gave this person a pair of glasses 
2374.5,when their eyesight started to falter. 
2376.9,So these sorts of stories. 
2378.12,Now just hearing this in the context 
2380.17,"of nothing but a scientific paper and discussion, "
2382.23,these probably aren't that impactful. 
2384.37,What's really important about this study 
2386.28,and is really important for all of us to know 
2388.33,is that these stories of other people receiving things 
2392.04,that were powerful for them in their life trajectory 
2394.44,is embedded in story. 
2396.67,And the human brain especially is so oriented towards story. 
2402.6,We have neural circuits that like to link together 
2406.04,"past, present future, have different characters, "
2408.87,protagonists and antagonists. 
2410.72,From the time we're very young 
2411.85,"until the time we're very old, "
2412.87,story is one of the major ways 
2415.24,that we organize information in the brain. 
2417.03,There does seem to be storytelling 
2419.66,and story listening circuits in the brain. 
2422.36,So what's important is not simply 
2424.162,that these people survived genocide. 
2426.53,That's obviously important and wonderful. 
2429.19,"But it's not just that they were helped along the way, "
2431.84,it's that the description of their help 
2433.74,is embedded in a larger story. 
2435.83,So the human subject in this scientific study 
2438.74,is watching these powerful stories. 
2441.21,And the neural circuits associated with pro-social behaviors 
2444.78,and with gratitude become robustly active 
2448.36,when they start to feel some affiliation 
2451.474,with the person telling the story. 
2453.16,They start to feel some resonance. 
2454.72,"We might call that empathy, "
2456.69,but it doesn't necessarily have to be empathy. 
2458.87,Empathy is a somewhat complicated thing to define 
2461.94,because it involves literally a setting aside 
2464.89,"of one's own emotions and really focusing almost entirely, "
2468.56,or experiencing almost entirely the emotions of another. 
2471.5,"It could be sympathy, it could be empathy. "
2473.78,What we do know is that the stories themselves 
2477.04,were able to shift the physiology of the subjects 
2479.67,"in this study and activate these, "
2481.9,what we're calling gratitude circuitry 
2483.98,that involves the prefrontal cortex. 
2485.97,So if you think about the earlier study 
2488.02,that receiving gratitude is the most powerful way 
2490.49,"to activate these circuits for gratitude, "
2494.0,the subjects in this study in many ways 
2495.87,"are receiving a sense of gratitude, "
2499.77,but through the narrative of one of these other subjects. 
2503.36,Which I find fascinating. 
2504.85,I would have thought a great gratitude practice 
2507.535,is when you sit down and list out 
2509.105,all the things you're grateful for. 
2509.938,That just seems so logical to me. 
2511.22,But it turns out 
2512.1,that these neurocircuits don't work that way. 
2513.65,That to really activate these circuits for gratitude 
2516.51,in the serotonin and that probably 
2518.02,"the oxytocin system as well, and its prefrontal networks, "
2521.092,one has to powerfully associate with the idea 
2524.69,"of receiving help, okay? "
2527.13,The subjects are associating 
2530.65,or experiencing empathy or sympathy 
2532.78,for somebody else who received help. 
2534.83,"In the other study we described a few minutes ago, "
2537.21,"the person hearing the letter was receiving gratitude, "
2540.26,and that would amplify the activity of these circuits. 
2543.07,"And that takes us to a larger theme of, "
2546.48,what are these pro-social circuits? 
2548.48,And an important concept to emerge from this 
2551.41,is one that's most often associated 
2553.77,"with the autism literature, frankly, "
2555.91,which is this idea of theory of mind. 
2558.24,"So just very briefly, theory of mind "
2560.32,is the ability to attribute or to understand the experience 
2564.59,of another without actually experiencing 
2567.61,the thing that they're experiencing. 
2569.03,"Again, it kind of sounds like empathy, "
2570.76,but this was actually a term that's now been demonstrated 
2576.06,"in the psychology and neuroscience, "
2577.56,that's been linked to some very robust findings 
2581.04,"associated with brain areas and so forth, "
2583.17,that was looking at autistic kids and non-autistic kids. 
2587.75,The person largely responsible for developing theory of mind 
2590.69,is Simon Baron-Cohen. 
2592.61,I believe he's either the brother or the cousin. 
2594.85,"I can't remember recall which, "
2596.08,to the comedian Sasha Baron-Cohen. 
2598.29,"Simon Baron-Cohen is a professor at Oxford University, "
2601.14,or at least he was the last time I checked. 
2603.16,And the theory of mind test can be done on adults 
2607.54,or on children. 
2608.92,"And we can sort of do that experiment right now, "
2610.83,"if you like, and you can think about how you would behave "
2612.91,if you were a subject in a theory of mind test. 
2616.48,Theory of mind test involves you or a child 
2618.61,"or some other adults, "
2619.52,sitting down and watching a video 
2622.2,"of a child going into a room or a person going into a room, "
2625.08,"opening up a desk or a dresser, a drawer for instance, "
2628.47,"or a desk drawer and placing something in it, "
2630.9,"like a pen or a toy, and then leaving. "
2633.72,And then another person walking into the room 
2636.8,"and clearly looking for something in the room, "
2640.5,"and one presumes it's the toy or the pen, "
2642.31,depending on the context. 
2644.208,People who have strong theory of mind 
2646.69,make the obvious conclusion that the person looking around 
2651.45,"for the pen or the toy is confused, or they're perplexed. "
2656.84,"They don't know where the toy is, "
2658.2,they're looking for the toy. 
2659.48,Someone who is fairly far to one side of the autism 
2664.09,or Asperger's spectrum will simply focus 
2668.24,"on the location of the object, "
2669.81,on the location of the pen or the toy. 
2672.72,And this is especially true in children. 
2674.3,"They will say, well, it's in the second drawer, "
2676.09,it's in the second drawer. 
2676.923,"And they'll say, well, how does the person "
2678.75,who comes into the room feel? 
2679.71,"And they'll say, well, it's in the drawer. "
2681.26,So they tend to focus on the specific factual elements 
2685.34,of the scenario rather than place their mind 
2688.35,into the mind of the other person. 
2690.51,So-called theory of mind. 
2691.97,Now that doesn't mean that people with autism 
2694.28,and Asperger's don't have empathy. 
2696.23,In some cases they can. 
2697.76,It sort of depends on where they are in the spectrum 
2699.76,and so forth. 
2700.65,But theory of mind has very strong basis 
2704.59,in these prefrontal cortex neural circuits 
2706.9,that we were talking about. 
2707.82,"Because, as you now know, "
2709.75,the prefrontal cortex sets context 
2712.58,on what we see and experience. 
2714.1,And the theory of mind task 
2715.56,that I just described very briefly is a pure example 
2720.69,"of context setting, right? "
2723.2,It's not about just the factual elements 
2725.73,"about the location of the objects, it's about the context. "
2729.16,Someone is looking for something 
2730.46,that someone else put someplace 
2732.01,that makes it such that that object is hidden. 
2735.12,So basically theory of mind is your ability 
2737.24,to put yourself into the mindset of another. 
2739.087,"And in order to get activation of these gratitude circuits, "
2744.42,one needs to put themselves into the mindset of another 
2747.82,or to directly receive gratitude. 
2750.12,So let's just take a moment and start to think about 
2752.62,how we are going to build out 
2754.05,the ultimate gratitude practice; 
2755.94,meaning the most effective gratitude practice 
2758.08,for us to do because of all the many positive effects 
2762.07,"that an effective gratitude practice can have, "
2764.72,if it's the proper one. 
2768.2,"It's very clear that receiving gratitude is powerful, "
2771.39,but it's also very clear that waiting around 
2773.55,to receive that gratitude is an impractical approach. 
2776.39,"Now, there are methods that have been developed "
2779.54,"by my colleague at Stanford, Kelly McGonigal and others "
2783.83,"that actually have developed things for the workplace, "
2786.32,"for school, for coworkers and students "
2788.41,to write out particular worksheets related to 
2792.53,what they're thankful for from others and exchange them. 
2794.397,And so those are very useful practices. 
2796.23,I don't want to take anything away from the important work 
2798.56,that Kelly and others have done. 
2800.56,But in the absence of having other people 
2802.99,"to do these practices with, "
2804.557,what we know for sure 
2806.56,is that there has to be a real experience 
2810.62,of somebody else's experience. 
2813.2,And that the best way to do that is story. 
2816.49,"So, in thinking about how to build out "
2818.87,"an effective gratitude practice, "
2821.02,"it's very worthwhile, I believe, "
2822.66,to find someone's narrative that's powerful for you. 
2828.067,"And many ways to think about this is, "
2829.858,it's got to be a story that inspires you 
2833.79,"because of the, for lack of a better phrase, "
2836.81,"the beauty of the human spirit, "
2838.68,or the ability of humans to help other humans. 
2841.9,And I find this remarkable because what this really means 
2845.47,is that the circuits for gratitude 
2848.12,are such that we can exchange gratitude. 
2852.37,"We can actually observe someone else getting help, "
2855.31,someone else giving help. 
2856.8,And that observation 
2858.78,"of our species doing that for one another, "
2861.841,allows us to experience the feeling of a genuine chemical 
2866.94,"and neural circuit activation lift, if you will. "
2870.57,"Very, very different than simply writing out "
2873.47,"the things that you're thankful for, right? "
2875.71,"And so, how would you do this? "
2877.85,"Well, people digest story in a number of different ways. "
2881.05,"People watch movies, people listen to podcasts, "
2883.91,people read books. 
2885.02,There are a tremendous number of stories out there. 
2887.903,It's clear that an effective gratitude practice 
2890.86,has to be repeated from time to time. 
2893.3,So what I would not suggest is that we build a protocol 
2896.65,in which you're constantly foraging 
2898.42,for inspirational stories over and over again. 
2901.18,Social media and the internet are replete with those. 
2903.874,"That's not going to be a very potent protocol or tool, "
2907.24,because the most potent protocol or tool for gratitude 
2909.86,is going to be one that you repeat over and over again. 
2913.055,"Rather, the most effective protocol or tool "
2916.35,"is going to be either to think into, "
2920.84,"and you could write this out if you like, "
2922.41,but think into when somebody was thankful 
2925.4,"for something that you did, "
2927.09,and really start to think about how you felt 
2929.62,"in receiving that gratitude, "
2932.513,"and/or I should say, imagining or thinking about deeply "
2938.06,the emotional experience of somebody else receiving help. 
2942.563,"Now, what narrative you select "
2945.22,is going to be very dependent on you and your taste. 
2947.98,It's going to be very dependent on what resonates with you. 
2950.89,"But again, I want to emphasize that the story "
2954.21,that you select does not have to have any semblance 
2957.11,"to your own life experience, "
2958.74,is just about what happens to move you. 
2961.02,"And so, the way that one could do this, "
2963.96,and actually I've started this practice for myself 
2966.23,on the basis of the learnings I've had in the last few weeks 
2969.38,"around preparing for this episode, "
2971.32,is to find a story that's particularly meaningful for you. 
2974.08,"And then to just take some short notes, "
2976.69,"bullet point notes about maybe list out for instance, "
2980.58,"on just a small sheet of paper or in your phone, "
2983.64,"if that's your preference, just list out for instance, "
2986.36,"you know, what the struggle was, "
2990.01,"what the help was, "
2991.75,"and something about how that impacts you emotionally, okay? "
2996.07,This is something just for you. 
2997.14,You don't have to share it with anybody. 
2999.41,That kind of shorthand list of bullet point notes 
3002.98,serves as your shorthand for getting into this mode 
3006.2,that we're calling gratitude. 
3007.35,And actually closely mimics a lot of what was done 
3010.63,in these various studies. 
3011.8,Because even though the studies 
3012.79,"I've talked about up until now, "
3014.44,"were really focused on what we call acute imaging studies, "
3018.0,where someone watched a story or received gratitude 
3021.34,"while the experiment was done, "
3022.89,and then that's it one and done. 
3024.192,There are other studies looking at gratitude in this context 
3027.77,"over many weeks, up to six weeks. "
3029.5,And what one observes 
3031.44,is that there's so-called neuroplasticity of these circuits. 
3034.58,Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's ability 
3036.82,to change in response to experience. 
3038.59,And that these neural circuits start developing 
3041.57,a familiarity with the narrative. 
3043.55,"So that, for instance, "
3044.74,let's say you sit down the first time you've found a story 
3047.36,that you find particularly compelling. 
3049.14,You've written down a few notes 
3051.18,about what that story is just to remind you. 
3053.699,And then you read those out 
3055.23,"and you think into the richness of that experience, "
3058.11,"that receiving of gratitude, "
3059.42,or if you prefer you're doing the protocol 
3061.38,where you're thinking about when someone was deeply grateful 
3064.15,"or was genuinely grateful to you, "
3065.963,that you're thinking about that. 
3067.49,The neural circuits become activated more easily 
3070.06,with each subsequent repeat of the practice. 
3072.44,Now this can be done literally for one minute 
3075.41,or two minutes or three minutes. 
3077.7,This is not an extensively long practice. 
3080.11,"And that's another beauty of gratitude practices, "
3082.73,is that they have these out-sized positive effects 
3085.54,"on so many aspects of our physiology, "
3087.6,but these are very short practices. 
3089.5,They're the kind of thing that you can do 
3090.62,walking to your car. 
3091.84,The kind of thing you can just sit down for a minute 
3093.35,"and set a timer and do, "
3095.3,because they are really 
3096.133,about changing your state of mind and body. 
3098.49,And if you have an experience of receiving gratitude 
3101.51,"or a story that's very potent for you, "
3103.538,"it becomes a sort of shortcut into the gratitude network, "
3107.31,these pro-social networks. 
3109.01,Meaning the activation of these circuits 
3110.57,becomes almost instantaneous. 
3112.28,And that's very different 
3113.28,than a lot of other practices out there. 
3115.45,"I'm not aware of any meditation practices for instance, "
3117.92,"that you can do only a few times, "
3120.051,"and then within a week or so, "
3123.69,you just have to do them for one minute. 
3124.95,You immediately drop into the kind of optimal state 
3127.71,that that meditation practice is designed to create. 
3130.16,There are some shorter meditation practices 
3131.84,that are very potent and very effective like that. 
3134.06,But gratitude and the circuits associated with it 
3136.75,appear to be especially plastic; 
3138.65,"meaning, especially prone to being able to be triggered, "
3143.25,"in the good sense of the word triggered, "
3144.9,just by simply reminding yourself 
3146.81,of this particular narrative. 
3148.41,Now there's another very clear and positive effect 
3150.8,of using this narrative or story-based approach 
3153.87,to a gratitude practice. 
3155.53,And that's what story does for our physiology. 
3160.26,"Now, earlier in the episode, "
3161.5,I mentioned this really incredible study 
3163.87,in which listening to a story coordinated the heart rates 
3169.23,"of different individuals, "
3171.43,and literally changed the way that their heart was beating. 
3175.02,The title of the study is conscious processing 
3178.62,of narrative stimulate synchronizes 
3180.64,heart rate between individuals. 
3182.01,"The first author is Perez, again, published in Cell Reports, "
3186.03,"Cell Press journal, excellent journal. "
3188.13,And it's a really elegant study. 
3189.81,They looked at instantaneous heart rate. 
3191.37,"They use electrocardiogram to do that, "
3193.05,which is simply a way to look at heart beats 
3195.45,with very fine precision. 
3197.56,They also looked at the breathing of subjects 
3199.7,as they listened to the stories. 
3201.74,Some of you may know that breathing and heart rate 
3204.51,are actually linked to one another 
3205.83,in a really interesting way. 
3207.34,"The simple way to put it is that when you inhale, "
3210.06,"your heart rate speeds up a little bit, "
3212.1,"and when you exhale, your heart rate slows down. "
3214.85,And this is because of the movement of the diaphragm 
3218.27,in your thoracic cavity. 
3220.61,And the physicians and medical types 
3223.1,call this respiratory sinus arrhythmia. 
3225.364,"There's a mechanism there we could get into, "
3227.33,but I don't want to distract us from the main theme here. 
3229.67,"So just remember when you inhale, your heart rate speeds up, "
3232.18,"and when you exhale, your heart rate slows down. "
3234.53,"They looked at breathing, they looked at heart rates "
3236.48,in different individuals. 
3237.93,And listening to a story 
3241.55,produced very consistent gaps between the heart rates 
3246.61,"of the people who are listening, "
3248.18,different individuals in the study 
3250.5,who were not located in the same place 
3253.26,"when they listened to the story, "
3255.13,"listening to the story on different times, "
3257.25,different days entirely had very similar heartbeat patterns 
3262.14,listening to the story. 
3263.91,What this means for your gratitude practice 
3265.86,is that having a story that you can return to 
3269.76,"over and over again, even if it's not the entire story, "
3272.53,you're just using the shorthand bullet point 
3274.87,"version of your story, will create a perceptible "
3278.83,and real shift in your heartbeat and in your breathing. 
3283.35,And actually that's been demonstrated over and over now 
3286.12,that an effective gratitude practice is one 
3288.55,"that can rapidly shift, "
3289.85,not just the activation of these circuits in your brain 
3292.76,"for pro-social behaviors, "
3294.36,but also activation of particular circuits in your heart 
3300.54,"and in your lungs and the other organs of your body, "
3302.81,such that you can get into a reproducible state 
3306.36,of gratitude each time. 
3308.66,"So an important component here is that, "
3311.26,"there be some element of story, "
3313.24,"again, you don't have to listen to or read "
3315.15,"or think about the entire story, start to finish "
3317.32,"in order to extract these benefits, "
3318.95,and that it be the same story over and over. 
3322.55,"And as a consequence, that's going to shift your physiology "
3325.33,"into presumably a more relaxed state, "
3327.85,because typically that's the one 
3328.98,that's associated with gratitude. 
3330.97,Although activation of these gratitude circuits 
3334.01,has also been shown to create sense of awe or sense of joy. 
3338.39,There are few studies looking at 
3339.89,and kind of parsing the difference 
3341.58,between gratitude and joy. 
3343.49,I was able to find a few studies about that. 
3346.06,"But in general, the neural circuits that are activated "
3349.64,tend to overlap quite a lot with those 
3352.095,that create a sense of gratitude. 
3354.35,So we don't want to split hairs on necessarily there. 
3356.75,"The key thing is that you want to use the same story, "
3359.89,"even if it's your own experience or somebody else's, "
3362.23,and keep coming back to it over and over again. 
3364.31,That makes it a very potent tool 
3365.98,that you can get a tremendous amount of benefit from 
3368.94,with even as short as 
60,seconds of practice. 
3372.66,"Earlier, I talked about how you can't lie to yourself "
3376.21,"and say, you know, I'm so grateful for this thing "
3379.09,that I actually hate. 
3380.64,"And in a moment, I'm going to tell you "
3383.11,about some scientific data that proves 
3385.29,"the statement I made is true, "
3388.21,and that you can't just lie to yourself 
3390.85,and derive the benefits of a gratitude practice. 
3393.97,"The data are also going to point to the fact that, "
3396.36,"if you are giving gratitude, not just receiving it, "
3399.64,"but giving gratitude, that too has to be genuine. "
3403.04,There's a really interesting studies 
3404.85,"published in scientific reports, "
3406.49,which is a nature research journal. 
3408.67,The title of it is Neural Responses to Intention 
3411.81,and Benefit Appraisal are Critical 
3413.87,in Distinguishing Gratitude and Joy. 
3415.91,"It's a somewhat complicated study, "
3417.84,so I'm just going to hit on some of the high points. 
3419.54,But basically what they did 
3420.78,is they use functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
3423.15,So they could look at brain circuitry activation 
3426.56,with very high precision. 
3428.46,And they had people receiving money 
3431.57,in the context of this experiment. 
3435.32,And they had some knowledge as to whether or not 
3438.49,the money that they were receiving 
3440.03,was given to them wholeheartedly or reluctantly. 
3443.4,"And there were a number of different variables in the study, "
3445.41,including how much money was given. 
3446.96,"So in some cases it was very little, "
3448.31,"in other cases, it was modest, "
3449.52,"in other cases, it was a lot more. "
3451.76,And they also varied the extent 
3453.69,"to which the giver of the money, called the benefactor, "
3457.26,was doing it wholeheartedly 
3458.69,or seem to be doing it somewhat reluctantly. 
3461.1,And they looked at whether or not the sense of gratitude 
3465.3,scaled with the amount of money received 
3469.37,and/or the intention of the benefactor. 
3473.17,Whether or not the person giving the money 
3474.69,was doing it wholeheartedly or reluctantly. 
3477.09,And what's remarkable 
3478.4,is that while the amount of money given 
3481.78,was a strong component in whether or not somebody felt 
3486.528,"that they had received gratitude, which makes sense, "
3490.21,"you know, the amount of money is some metric "
3493.48,of whether or not somebody feels thanked. 
3497.04,"The stronger variable, the bigger impact came from "
3500.52,whether or not the person giving the money 
3502.9,was giving it with a wholehearted intention 
3506.1,and not a reluctant intention. 
3508.33,"And of course, there was an interaction "
3510.08,"where the best circumstance of course, "
3511.88,is where the person received a lot of money 
3514.06,from somebody who wholeheartedly 
3515.55,wanted to give them a lot of money. 
3516.88,And they did every derivation of this. 
3518.41,But this is of important. 
3520.14,This tells us many things 
3522.27,"that extend way beyond gratitude practices, "
3524.85,"which is that, genuine thanks are what count. "
3529.61,Okay? 
3530.443,We could probably presume that. 
3532.27,But receiving genuine thanks is also a strong variable 
3536.83,"in determining whether or not we experience real gratitude, "
3541.01,"or whether or not it's empty, "
3543.01,regardless of the size of a gift. 
3545.15,"So this constrains our gratitude practices somewhat, "
3548.49,"but I think in an interesting and important way, "
3551.089,you can't make this stuff up. 
3553.47,You can't tell yourself that an experience was great 
3555.79,"or that I got a lot of money and therefore it justified it, "
3560.6,"even though I think that they give it to me reluctantly, "
3563.13,"or my boss hates me, but they gave me a raise. "
3565.83,"That stuff stings for all the right reasons, "
3568.5,because there are circuits in our brain and body 
3571.27,that are oriented towards these pro-social interactions. 
3574.57,"And in some sense, what we are looking for as a species, "
3577.28,"what these circuits want, if you will, "
3579.63,is to receive things from people 
3582.02,that are giving them wholeheartedly. 
3583.86,"And that tells us that if we are the giver, "
3586.93,"that we better be giving wholeheartedly, "
3589.0,or we are undermining the sense of gratitude 
3591.68,that someone is going to receive from us. 
3593.81,So we are gradually building up 
3595.6,the ultimate gratitude practice 
3598.05,based on the variety of scientific literature 
3601.03,that's out there. 
3602.38,And I know that many people are probably interested 
3604.99,"in developing a gratitude practice that has long lasting, "
3608.12,maybe even permanent positive effects 
3609.84,on their neural circuitry. 
3611.38,"So with that in mind, I want to turn our attention "
3614.77,to a really interesting study. 
3616.722,It's entitled effects of gratitude meditation 
3619.569,on neural network functional connectivity 
3622.1,and brain heart coupling. 
3624.14,And to make a long story short and a lot simpler 
3627.32,"than that title, "
3628.97,repeated gratitude practice 
3631.78,changes the way that your brain circuits work. 
3634.68,And it also changes the way in which your heart 
3637.71,and your brain interact. 
3639.98,You're familiar with the fact 
3641.424,that your brain controls your heart 
3642.257,because you could be stressed about something 
3643.27,"that's perceived with your brain, "
3644.63,and then your heart rate will speed up. 
3646.56,You're probably also familiar with the fact 
3647.98,that if your heart rate speeds up 
3649.39,"for some reason or no reason, "
3650.86,"you're probably thinking, "
3651.693,"well, what's making my heart rate speed up? "
3652.687,And that's because the brain and the heart 
3654.83,"are reciprocally innervated, as we say. "
3658.02,They're talking to one another in both directions. 
3659.96,It's a two way highway. 
3661.806,This study looked at changes 
3663.8,in so-called functional connectivity within the brain 
3667.43,"and between the brain and the heart, "
3669.63,in response to gratitude practices. 
3672.31,"And as a control they used, "
3673.98,"what I think is very interesting, a resentment intervention. "
3676.93,I think resentment is an apt control 
3680.91,and quite different than gratitude. 
3683.12,"To make a long story short, what they found "
3684.77,is that a repeated gratitude practice 
3687.03,could change the resting state functional connectivity 
3690.91,in emotion and motivation-related brain regions. 
3694.36,If I haven't mentioned a strong enough incentive 
3696.47,"for doing a regular gratitude practice until now, "
3699.63,this is definitely the one to pay attention to. 
3702.64,Because what they found was a regular gratitude practice 
3706.27,could shift the functional conductivity of emotion pathways 
3710.07,in ways that made anxiety and fear circuits 
3713.37,"less likely to be active, "
3714.91,"and circuits for feelings of wellbeing, "
3717.65,but also motivation to be much more active. 
3721.46,I find that remarkable and important 
3723.18,because a number of people struggle 
3725.1,with issues of motivation. 
3726.3,A lot of people who are highly motivated 
3728.53,also have issues with anxiety and fear. 
3730.75,And so this study really points to the fact 
3733.37,that it's a twofer. 
3734.37,If you have a good gratitude practice 
3736.07,"and you repeat it regularly, "
3737.94,"you reduce the fear, anxiety circuits, "
3740.81,"you increase the efficacy of the positive emotion, "
3746.02,"feel good circuits, "
3746.98,and the circuits associated with motivation and pursuit 
3749.84,are actually enhanced as well. 
3751.57,So that's very strong incentive to have a gratitude practice 
3755.627,and one that you use regularly. 
3756.97,We'll talk about how regularly in just a moment. 
3760.62,"I don't want to go into too many details of the study, "
3762.401,although we will put a reference to it if you like. 
3764.48,"It includes a lot of fMRI data, "
3767.01,"imaging data of different brain areas, "
3768.52,"many, many tables and examples of matrices "
3770.77,"of before and after gratitude, after resentment, et cetera, "
3774.86,"you do indeed have circuits in your brain for resentment, "
3777.21,"whether you like it or not, we all do. "
3780.14,"And some people, "
3781.31,just those circuits are more robust than others. 
3783.54,But the remarkable thing is one can shift these circuits 
3786.73,in the direction that I think most people would like; 
3789.44,which is more sense of wellbeing and motivation 
3791.63,and less resentment and fear literally. 
3794.84,And what's really cool about this study also 
3797.23,is that the interventions are only five minutes long. 
3801.82,"It's incredible, five minutes long. "
3804.46,"And so, as we start to build out "
3806.8,"our ideal gratitude practice, "
3809.32,we know that it has to have certain features. 
3811.25,"First of all, it has to be grounded in a story, "
3814.28,probably a story that you've heard 
3815.73,in its entirety at least once. 
3817.45,"But then you can have a shorthand version, "
3819.93,the so-called bullet points that I talked about before 
3822.03,that allow you to drop into that story 
3824.79,or the emotional associations with that story. 
3826.93,So you don't have to listen to the whole story each time. 
3829.52,And that story should be one 
3830.353,in which you are genuinely being thanked for something 
3833.43,"and it made you feel good, "
3834.78,or it could be a story about 
3836.4,"someone else genuinely expressing thanks, okay? "
3839.65,Based on the description of the gratitude practices 
3843.3,that we talked about earlier. 
3845.78,Your gratitude practice can be very brief. 
3848.35,"I mean, it be as brief as one minute, "
60,"seconds, "
3851.35,"or five minutes, which still seems very brief to me. "
3853.89,"Although in these studies, "
3855.12,they were getting these really major effects 
3857.34,just from five minutes of gratitude practice. 
3860.42,Some of these papers involve people doing some focusing 
3865.57,on their breathing and calming themselves 
3868.32,"as they go into the gratitude practice, "
3870.01,but that's within the five minute block. 
3872.06,So if you decide that you're going to do 
3873.83,a gratitude practice that involves first doing 
3877.8,"some calming breathing, "
3878.8,"exhale emphasized breathing, for instance, "
3880.71,"or physiological size, things I've talked about before "
3882.84,on this podcast that can help calm me down 
3884.52,"'cause they have a lot of exhales, which you now know, "
3887.551,"slows your heart rate down, "
3889.121,"and then doing your gratitude practice, that's fine. "
3890.85,"It's actually not necessary, "
3892.3,but a lot of these studies used that. 
3894.85,"I think once a narrative has been set, "
3897.73,"you've heard the story and it has meaning for you, "
3899.79,or you have a recollection of a story 
3901.74,"where you are genuinely thanked, "
3903.26,then I think just 
60,seconds or maybe 
120,seconds 
3907.97,should be sufficient. 
3909.19,"Then the question becomes, "
3910.023,how often to repeat this gratitude practice. 
3913.153,That's not exactly clear from the existing literature. 
3917.29,I can't point to any one study that says five times a week 
3919.81,or four times a week. 
3920.643,So I'm going to throw out a number 
3922.143,"which is three times a week, and then people will ask, "
3926.26,"well, when should I do that gratitude practice? "
3928.47,And I'll tell you what I tell everybody 
3931.64,"about almost every practice with a few exceptions, "
3934.0,which is the best time of day to do this practice 
3936.93,"is when you first wake up in the morning, "
3939.007,"or before you go to sleep at night, or any time of day. "
3942.94,So we've talked about some of the neurocircuitry changes 
3945.46,associated with a regular gratitude practice. 
3948.37,And I should mention 
3949.3,that there's an additional neurocircuitry shift that occurs. 
3952.786,It relates to a structure that I mentioned 
3955.09,"just briefly earlier, "
3956.06,which is the so-called ACC or anterior cingulate cortex. 
3959.54,"This is an area of the brain that has several functions, "
3962.05,but more and more data are pointing to the fact 
3964.01,that the ACC is actually involved in empathy 
3967.57,and is involved in understanding the emotional states 
3970.73,"of others in general, "
3971.78,even if it doesn't evoke a sense of empathy. 
3973.94,And there are several studies that point to the fact 
3977.04,"that in humans who have a regular gratitude practice, "
3979.8,"the ACC becomes more robustly engaged, "
3982.93,even with these very brief gratitude practices. 
3985.44,We actually have a project in our lab. 
3987.809,"This is actually done in animal models, "
3990.35,where animals observe other animals 
3993.43,experiencing certain emotional states. 
3997.25,And one of the brain areas that we've identified 
3999.56,as important for this; 
4001.38,it's kind of a primordial form of empathy 
4003.63,'cause we really don't know what these mice are thinking. 
4006.5,"We work on humans, in the case where we work on humans, "
4009.21,of course we ask them and they tell us 
4011.05,what they think they're thinking. 
4012.652,"With the mice, we ask them, "
4014.29,but they don't tell us much of anything interesting. 
4016.05,Instead we measure a number of physiological signals. 
4018.65,"But the important point is that the ACC, "
4021.16,the anterior cingulate cortex seems to be an important hub 
4024.7,for the generation and execution of empathy 
4029.15,as it relates to feelings and empathic behaviors; 
4031.79,altruistic behaviors of animals helping animals 
4034.45,and humans helping other humans. 
4036.42,"We see this in the animal models, we see this in humans. "
4038.98,"So, if you want to be a more empathic person, "
4041.86,a gratitude practice 
4042.83,"is also going to be very effective for that, it appears, "
4046.65,especially using this narrative type approach 
4049.06,where you are using someone else's narrative 
4051.35,of receiving gratitude 
4053.27,as a way to tap into your own sense of gratitude. 
4056.34,"Thus far, we've mainly talked about the effects of gratitude "
4058.95,"on neural circuit activation, "
4060.517,and changes a little bit about some of the changes 
4063.35,"that are happening in terms of the body, "
4064.82,heart rate and breathing and so forth. 
4066.45,But we haven't talked a lot yet about the changes 
4070.07,"in health metrics, in things like inflammation "
4073.33,or reductions in inflammation and immunity 
4076.53,and things of that sort. 
4077.89,"So with that in mind, I'd like to describe the results "
4080.17,of a really interesting recent study that was published 
4082.59,in the journal Brain Behavior and Immunity. 
4084.75,This was published 
2021.,
4086.05,"The title of the study is, "
4088.09,Exploring Neural Mechanisms of the Health Benefits 
4090.47,of Gratitude in Women: A Randomized Control Trial. 
4093.2,The first author is Hazlitt. 
4095.38,"And basically, what this paper showed "
4097.984,was that women who had a regular gratitude practice 
4103.57,"of the sort that we've been talking about up until now, "
4106.32,showed reductions in amygdala activity; 
4109.883,"a brain area associated with threat detection, "
4112.33,a intimate part of the fear network in the brain. 
4114.79,"So reductions in amygdala activation, "
4118.2,and large reductions in the production 
4122.81,"of something called TNF-alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha, "
4126.15,and IL-
"6,",interleukin six. 
4128.5,"Now, if you happen to have listened to the episode "
4130.43,that I did on activating your immune system 
4132.995,"and immune function, you heard about TNF-alpha and IL-"
6.,
4137.53,TNF-alpha and IL six are inflammatory cytokines. 
4141.15,"These are chemicals that exist in your body, "
4143.87,and that are released from cells when there is damage 
4148.82,or kind of a systemic stress; when your system is in duress. 
4153.17,"And in the short-term, they can be beneficial. "
4155.19,They can call in signals for wound healing 
4156.977,"and repair of cells, et cetera, "
4159.18,but you don't want TNF-alpha and IL-
6,"levels to be too high, "
4162.95,and you don't want those levels to be up for too long. 
4166.26,"And so, this study is really nice "
4168.12,because they showed significant effects 
4170.02,in reducing TNF-alpha and IL-
6,
4172.87,in response to a gratitude practice. 
4176.24,And because they also observed reductions 
4178.62,"in amygdala activation, "
4180.809,"this area associated with threat detection and fear, "
4183.796,"it's likely, and I should emphasize likely, "
4187.3,"'cause I don't know, "
4188.42,that the direction of the effect 
4189.81,"is that there are neural circuit changes, "
4191.29,which in turn shift the degree 
4194.15,to which these inflammatory cytokines 
4195.89,are released in the body. 
4196.76,"Although for all I know, it could be the other way too. "
4199.66,It could be that having a gratitude practice 
4202.07,"shifts something about heart rate and breathing, "
4203.92,which in turn lowers the amount of TNF-alpha and IL-
"6,",
4207.817,and that in turn reduces activation of the amygdala. 
4210.53,"We don't really know the direction of the effect, excuse me, "
4213.48,"but if I had to speculate, I would speculate "
4215.43,that it was a shift in neural circuitry 
4217.36,that led to a change in the circuits of the body. 
4221.01,And another interesting aspect of this study 
4223.04,is that the reductions in amygdala activation 
4225.97,and the reductions in TNF-alpha and IL-
6,were very rapid. 
4229.8,They occurred almost immediately 
4231.98,after the gratitude practice was completed. 
4235.03,And even though that study was performed 
4236.67,"exclusively on female subjects, "
4238.674,based on the biology and circuitry of the amygdala 
4241.96,and the biology of TNF-alpha and IL-
6,
4245.33,"performing this inflammatory role in both men and women, "
4249.42,I don't see any reason 
4250.29,why the results of that study wouldn't pertain 
4252.45,to both men and women. 
4254.24,So what about the chemistry associated with gratitude? 
4257.06,Are there certain chemicals in our brain 
4258.47,or that we could enhance in our brain 
4260.61,that would enhance our gratitude practice? 
4263.95,"Indeed, there are. "
4264.93,"And earlier I mentioned the chemical, "
4267.17,the neuromodulator serotonin as having a powerful influence 
4271.01,on the activation of neural circuits 
4272.54,"associated pro-social behaviors and gratitude, "
4275.52,and other sort of feel good behaviors. 
4278.244,"To make a long story short, "
4280.12,neuromodulators like dopamine and epinephrine 
4282.84,and norepinephrine tend to place us into a state 
4285.86,"of external perception, "
4287.96,meaning a state of observing things and focusing on things 
4291.41,outside the immediate reach of our body 
4294.2,and confines of our skin. 
4295.26,"They tend to put us in pursuit, "
4297.23,or in thinking about things out in the future 
4299.77,or out away from our physical body. 
4303.16,Whereas the neuromodulators serotonin 
4305.33,and some of the associated pathways like oxytocin 
4308.55,"and other neurochemicals tend to, I want to emphasize, "
4312.01,tend to be associated with states that are about contentment 
4316.33,with what we have within the confines of our body 
4318.89,and our immediate experience. 
4320.49,"So they're not so much about pursuit, "
4322.1,but about gratitude and about appreciation 
4324.76,for what we already have. 
4327.391,I'd be remiss if I didn't therefore point out 
4331.13,that if one were to shift their chemistry 
4334.54,"toward having higher levels of serotonin, "
4337.13,"you would, by all logic, "
4339.99,experience heightened levels of gratitude. 
4342.29,And indeed some people do this. 
4343.61,They will take compounds that increase serotonin. 
4345.86,"There are a number of compounds out there, as you know. "
4348.04,I'm certainly not suggesting people do that. 
4349.91,"A couple of the supplement based legal, "
4352.3,over-the-counter approaches to this 
4354.229,are things like 
"5-HTP,",which is a precursor to serotonin. 
4359.57,Some people will take 
5-HTP,
4361.15,to try and enhance their sleep. 
4362.55,"I'm not a fan of doing that, personally. "
4365.137,I've talked about this in the sleep episodes. 
4367.27,But the state that we call sleep has a very complex 
4372.29,and important architecture as it relates to neurochemicals. 
4375.7,And by taking serotonin by supplement 
4378.22,or by stimulating serotonin release by supplement 
4380.54,with 
5-HTP,"or with tryptophan, "
4382.6,"which is an amino acid precursor to serotonin, "
4385.97,one can run into the problem 
4387.4,of disrupting the normal architecture of sleep cycles 
4390.36,throughout the night. 
4391.193,"I experienced that as, if I've taken "
5-HTP,"or tryptophan, "
4394.18,"I fall asleep very deeply, "
4395.37,but then I wake up three hours later 
4396.98,and I can't fall asleep at all. 
4398.56,And actually it sometimes even messes up my sleep 
4400.54,the subsequent night. 
4401.83,Some people are not so sensitive to 
5-HTP,in tryptophan 
4404.53,and they actually really like it. 
4405.59,"So again, you have to talk to your doctor, "
4407.61,decide what's right for you. 
4408.63,"You're responsible for your health, not me. "
4410.42,And you have to determine what works for you. 
4411.97,Everyone's slightly individual. 
4413.53,But one could imagine enhancing their amount of serotonin 
4418.84,in their brain and body by taking 
5-HTP,or tryptophan 
4422.71,"before a gratitude practice, "
4424.02,that seems a little bit extreme 
4425.35,given that the gratitude practice is only about a minute 
4427.44,"to five minutes long on a regular basis, "
4429.22,but there may be instances 
4430.77,in which you're really trying to amplify the circuitry 
4433.42,"in the brain and body that are associated with gratitude, "
4436.0,and therefore that might be something 
4437.39,that you want to explore. 
4439.01,There's a new compound that's out there. 
4441.21,A legal over-the-counter compound. 
4444.06,"At least it's legal in the United States, "
4446.23,I don't know about overseas. 
4447.51,"And that's a compound called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A. "
4452.84,It's an interesting compound. 
4454.24,"It goes by another name as well, which is, "
4457.46,"and I'm going to mispronounce this and I apologize, "
4459.25,this is Sceletium tortuosum. 
4462.16,Please see our timestamps 
4463.68,if you want to see the spelling of that. 
4465.345,"But I'll just call it Kanna, by its other name for short. "
4469.36,It's an herb that is traditionally chewed 
4473.55,"prior to stressing endeavors, "
4475.36,is how it's described on an examine.com. 
4477.33,But I looked at some of the studies on this. 
4478.91,It's kind of interesting. 
4479.743,It very likely increases the amount of serotonin in the body 
4483.26,and pretty potently. 
4484.641,It is generally taken in dosages 
4488.07,of anywhere from 
25,to 
50,milligrams. 
4490.084,"And it creates a kind of a pro-social gratitude enhancing, "
4496.61,or I should say gratitude circuitry 
4498.87,pro-social neurocircuitry enhancing effect 
4503.13,because of the ways that it interacts 
4505.22,with the certain urgent pathways of the brain. 
4508.38,"So it also has another name, "
4510.28,"it's sometimes called Zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N. "
4513.9,"Again, I'm not suggesting that people run out "
4515.57,and take this stuff. 
4516.49,But there is an emerging practice 
4519.294,"of people using Zembrine, Sceletium tortuosum, "
4523.42,"also called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A, "
4526.383,in order to enhance the states that are about comfort 
4531.23,and pleasure with what one has 
4533.59,in their immediate sphere of experience. 
4536.08,And so one could imagine 
4537.722,if it's safe for you and right for you 
4539.68,and legal where you live in enhancing serotonin 
4544.32,by taking Kanna and then doing your gratitude practice. 
4547.459,What's the logic behind that? 
4549.23,"Well, oftentimes we hear about "
4552.84,"supplements and pharmacology for ""increasing plasticity"" "
4556.53,"or ""opening plasticity."" "
4557.86,"You know, if I had a dollar for every time someone said, "
4559.91,I hear that such and such opens plasticity. 
4562.84,"Well, indeed there are molecules "
4564.59,associated with the thing that we call neuroplasticity. 
4567.23,"But neuroplasticity is not an event, it's a process; "
4570.86,"meaning it has many, many steps. "
4572.45,"It occurs during wakefulness, "
4573.74,it's consolidated during sleep and so forth. 
4576.588,Taking a substance that increases 
4579.13,"a neurochemical in your brain will likely, "
4582.72,provided it's the right substance 
4584.36,"and it's the right practice, "
4586.56,will likely enhance the amplitude or the intensity 
4590.2,of that practice and make it a more potent form 
4593.3,of inducing neuroplasticity. 
4594.57,Meaning it will create longer lasting 
4597.5,or more robust brain changes 
4599.5,"than if one hadn't increased their chemistry in this way, "
4603.47,this way of taking something. 
4605.59,But that doesn't necessarily mean 
4606.84,"that you couldn't get to the very same place without it, "
4608.99,by simply doing a slightly longer attitude practice 
4612.08,or putting a little bit more mental effort into it. 
4614.75,"That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity "
4619.0,"really resides in not just one approach, "
4621.58,not just neurochemistry and taking substances 
4624.32,"to increase neuroplasticity, "
4625.8,not just behavioral practices 
4627.5,"to try and increase neuro-plasticity, "
4629.086,not just brain machine interfaces 
4631.278,"or devices to increase neuro-plasticity, "
4634.53,but rather the convergence of multiple tools. 
4637.31,"So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, "
4640.79,as we say in the brain 
4641.91,"using something like Kanna, "
4643.01,combined with a gratitude practice. 
4645.3,"In the not-too-distant future, "
4646.6,this will probably also be combined 
4647.96,with some sort of noninvasive device 
4650.41,to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time. 
4653.01,Please don't do that recreationally. 
4654.35,Those devices are for clinical use only currently. 
4656.685,But I think you start to get the idea. 
4659.61,So for those of you that are a little bit more exploratory 
4661.94,"and you want to go in and do some reading on this, "
4664.14,I thought you might find Kanna interesting. 
4666.17,I certainly did. 
4667.11,There are a number of studies that will pop up on PubMed. 
4669.14,I recommend using examine.com as your jumping off point. 
4672.784,There are some decent studies 
4674.7,that they described in their so-called human effect matrix. 
4677.14,So those are studies done on humans. 
4678.77,And the main effects that have been documented 
4681.16,"in the scientific literature are minor, "
4683.95,"but significant increases in cognition, executive function. "
4687.21,Executive function is something 
4688.39,"that's also associated with prefrontal cortex, "
4690.55,and reductions in anxiety. 
4692.1,And that seems to be a common theme 
4693.67,that we're seeing again and again. 
4695.39,"You saw this in the study, "
4696.814,the trial where we saw reductions in TNF-alpha 
4700.15,and reductions amygdala activation. 
4702.9,Which would ostensibly lead to reductions in anxiety. 
4706.97,You're seeing increases in activity in brain networks 
4709.82,that are associated with feelings of wellbeing. 
4711.5,"So again, back to that kind of push-pull "
4713.9,of defensive anxiety and fear-like circuitry in the brain 
4717.23,"being antagonistic, as we say, "
4719.88,"to the circuits that are associated with pro-social, "
4722.0,"feeling good, receiving good feelings, "
4724.53,type circuitry and events in life. 
4727.09,"So as you now know, there is a lot of science "
4729.38,about how gratitude can positively impact 
4732.01,neural circuits in the brain. 
4733.376,"Anti-inflammatory markers in the body, "
4736.11,"brain-heart breathing coordination, and on and on and on. "
4740.305,I'd like to just highlight the key elements 
4743.26,"of the most effective, at least to my knowledge, "
4746.1,gratitude practice. 
4747.57,"And when I say the most effective, "
4749.16,what I'm doing is I'm gleaning from the scientific studies 
4751.9,I was able to find and combining the various findings 
4755.23,"of those studies into what I think is a very practical, "
4758.73,and what should certainly be a very effective 
4761.44,gratitude practice 
4762.5,for all the positive effects that we described. 
4765.18,"First of all, that gratitude practice "
4767.65,"has to be grounded in a narrative, meaning a story. "
4771.36,You don't have to recite or hear that story 
4773.89,"every single time you do the gratitude practice, "
4777.03,but you have to know what that story was 
4779.24,and what the gratitude practice references back to. 
4782.97,"Second of all, that story can be one "
4785.83,of you receiving genuine thanks. 
4790.09,And the key elements there 
4791.41,"are that you are the one receiving the thanks, "
4793.55,"the gratitude, "
4794.57,"and that it's being given to you genuinely, wholeheartedly. "
4800.87,Or it can be a story of you observing someone else 
4805.48,receiving thanks or expressing thanks. 
4808.87,"And that has to be a genuine interaction as well, "
4811.75,both between the giver and the receiver. 
4815.68,"So, those are the first three elements. "
4818.42,What I recommend would be after you've established 
4821.64,"the story that you want to use for your gratitude practice, "
4824.96,that you write down three or four simple bullet points 
4828.15,"that can serve as salient reminders of that story for you, "
4831.82,it will serve as kind of a cue for that story 
4834.25,"without having to listen to, or talk out the entire story. "
4839.24,I would recommend writing down something 
4841.47,about the state that you or the other person were in 
4844.76,"before they received the gratitude, "
4847.06,the state that you were in or that the person was in 
4850.11,"after they received the gratitude, "
4852.03,and any other elements 
4854.01,that lend some sort of emotional weight 
4856.13,or tone to the story. 
4857.42,"This could be three pages of text, if you like, "
4859.89,or it could just be a couple of bullet points. 
4862.32,I don't think it really matters. 
4863.39,The important thing is that it's embedded in your memory 
4865.49,and that it's really associated 
4866.62,"with this genuine exchange of thanks, "
4869.375,and the receival of things. 
4870.94,I think those are the key elements. 
4872.68,And then it's very simple: 
4873.64,The entire practice involves reading off these bullet points 
4877.56,as a cue to your nervous system of the sense of gratitude. 
4882.81,"And then for about one minute, "
4885.31,which is a trivial amount of time 
4886.85,"if you really think about it, or maybe two minutes, "
4889.61,or if you're really ambitious up to five minutes 
4891.69,of just really feeling into that genuine experience 
4895.42,of having received gratitude 
4896.81,or observed someone else receiving gratitude. 
4900.99,"And then in terms of frequency, I think a good rule of thumb "
4904.86,would be to do that about three times a week. 
4907.36,And the time of day doesn't really matter. 
4909.81,I can't see why there would be 
4911.36,any so-called circadian effects of this. 
4913.19,I know some people like to do a gratitude practice 
4915.05,before they go to sleep at night. 
4916.76,I don't see any problem with doing this 
4918.53,before you go to sleep at night. 
4919.53,I also don't see any problem with you doing this 
4921.37,on your lunch break or mid-morning 
4923.39,or first thing in the morning. 
4924.45,I can't see any logic for placing it at any one time of day 
4928.45,and not another. 
4929.69,So I think the most important thing 
4930.72,is that you do it at least three times a week. 
4933.45,"And as mentioned before, it's very, very brief. "
4935.78,So there are very few barriers to entry for doing this. 
4939.38,So if we just take a step back from this protocol 
4941.97,and compare it to what's typically out there 
4944.18,"in the literature, which is, "
4946.178,"make a list of all the things you're thankful for, "
4948.43,"recite in your mind all the things you're thankful for, "
4951.04,count your blessings. 
4951.873,So I think everybody should be counting their blessings 
4953.61,all the time. 
4954.443,There's always something to be thankful for. 
4955.92,But in terms of a scientifically grounded gratitude practice 
4960.37,that has also scientifically demonstrated 
4963.09,to shift your physiology at the level of your immune system 
4967.03,"and your look neurocircuitry, "
4968.54,"reducing anxiety, increasing motivation, "
4971.08,all these wonderful things that so many of us 
4972.927,"are chasing all the time as goals, "
4975.89,I think a gratitude practice reveals itself 
4978.42,to be an immensely powerful tool 
4981.02,for any and all of us to use. 
4982.8,And that should come as no surprise 
4984.53,because these pro-social circuits for gratitude 
4986.994,are not a recent phenomenon. 
4989.78,"Discussions about gratitude date back hundreds, "
4992.51,if not thousands of years. 
4994.09,What we've done today is to take the modern science 
4996.2,right up until 
"2021,",
4998.55,"and to really distill from that the neuroimaging data, "
5001.46,"the neurochemistry, the various aspects "
5003.82,"of brain-body connectivity, look at the protocols, "
5006.6,take various subject groups. 
5007.98,"Some were done in women, "
5008.92,"some were done between two individuals, "
5010.74,"some were done with brain imaging, "
5011.82,all the various changes on a theme 
5016.562,"that allow us to point to a simple, "
5019.73,but very effective protocol that certainly we could all use 
5022.96,around Thanksgiving. 
5024.1,"But Thanksgiving is just, but one day "
5027.47,"throughout the entire year, of course. "
5029.44,I personally have been using a gratitude protocol 
5031.89,for the last several years. 
5033.78,"But that protocol was based on my ignorance, really, "
5037.27,"about the scientific literature, "
5038.817,and was mainly based 
5040.75,"on what I'd heard out there in the internet, "
5043.01,"which is that I should list out or think about, "
5046.03,or verbally recite the things that I'm grateful for. 
5049.7,The sort of protocol that we arrived at today 
5052.73,based on the scientific literature 
5054.5,is distinctly different from that. 
5056.47,"And as a consequence, I've started to script out "
5059.2,"a protocol identical to the one I just described, "
5062.73,and I intend to use that going forward.

5094.44,"During today's episode, and in many previous episodes, "
5096.9,I mentioned supplements. 
5098.09,Supplements aren't for everybody. 
5099.33,"But if you are going to use supplements, "
5100.94,it's imperative that the supplements 
5102.42,be of the very highest quality. 
5103.96,"For that reason we've partnered with Thorne, "
5105.95,"that's T-H-O-R-N-E, "
5107.44,because Thorne supplements 
5108.82,"have the highest levels of stringency, "
5110.75,in terms of the quality of the ingredients they include 
5113.47,and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients 
5115.65,they include in their products. 
5117.63,"They've partnered with every major sports team, "
5119.45,"as well as the Mayo Clinic, "
5120.54,so we're delighted to be partnered with them as well.

5150.12,thank you for your interest in science.
