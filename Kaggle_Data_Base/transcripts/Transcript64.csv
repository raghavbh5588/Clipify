0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
1.91,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.93,for everyday life. 
5.763,[upbeat music] 
9.32,I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology 
11.77,and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.96,"Today my guest is Dr. David Berson, "
17.22,"Professor of Medical Science, Neurobiology and Ophthalmology "
20.47,at Brown University. 
22.29,Dr. Berson's laboratory is credited 
23.758,with discovering the cells in the eye 
26.01,that set your circadian rhythms. 
27.802,These are the so-called intrinsically 
30.12,photosensitive melanopsin cells. 
32.06,"And while that's a mouthful, "
33.75,"all you need to know for sake of this introduction is that, "
36.051,those are the cells that inform your brain and body 
38.81,about the time of day. 
40.61,Dr. Berson's laboratory has also made 
42.153,a number of other important discoveries 
44.27,about how we convert our perceptions of the outside world 
47.91,into motor action. 
50.11,"More personally, Dr. Berson has been my go-to resource "
53.29,for all things neuroscience for nearly two decades. 
57.23,I knew of his reputation as a spectacular researcher 
60.22,for a long period of time. 
61.71,"And then many years ago, I cold called him out of the blue, "
65.11,I basically corralled him into a long conversation 
68.26,over the phone after which he invited me out to Brown 
70.96,and we've been discussing neuroscience 
73.05,and how the brain works and the emerging new technologies 
76.75,and the emerging new concepts in neuroscience 
79.5,for a very long time now. 
82.05,You're going to realize today 
83.13,why Dr. Berson is my go-to source. 
85.64,He has an exceptionally clear and organized view 
89.3,of how the nervous system works. 
91.39,"There are many many parts of the nervous system, "
93.58,different nuclei and connections and circuits and chemicals 
96.46,"and so forth, but it takes a special kind of person "
99.21,to be able to organize that information into a structured 
102.33,and logical framework that can allow us to make sense 
105.76,"of how we function in terms of what we feel, "
108.22,"what we experience, how we move through the world. "
111.07,Dr. Berson is truly one of a kind in his ability 
114.09,to synthesize and organize and communicate that information. 
117.41,"And I give him credit as one of my mentors, "
120.15,and one of the people that I respect most 
122.3,in the field of science and medical science generally. 
125.27,Today Dr. Berson takes us on a journey 
127.62,"from the periphery of the nervous system, "
129.36,"meaning from the outside, "
131.24,"deep into the nervous system layer by layer, "
134.07,"structure by structure, circuit by circuit "
136.394,making clear to us 
137.91,how each of these individual circuits work 
140.05,and how they work together as a whole. 
142.47,It's a really magnificent description 
144.53,"that you simply cannot get from any textbook, "
147.47,"from any popular book and frankly, as far as I know, "
150.31,from any podcast that currently exists out there. 
153.16,So it's a real gift to have this opportunity 
154.92,to learn from Dr. Berson. 
156.203,"Again, I consider him my mentor in the field of learning "
160.0,"and teaching neuroscience, "
161.48,and I'm excited for you to learn from him. 
163.81,"One thing is for certain, by the end of this podcast, "
166.72,you will know far more about how your nervous system works 
169.59,than the vast majority of people out there 
171.303,including many expert biologists and neuroscientists. 
175.36,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
178.04,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
180.98,It is however part of my desire and effort 
182.92,"to bring zero-cost to consumer information about science, "
185.5,and science-related tools to the general public. 
188.25,"In keeping with that theme, "
189.27,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
191.705,Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. 
194.29,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one 
195.9,vitamin mineral probiotic drink. 
198.32,I've been taking Athletic Greens every day since 
2012.,
201.54,So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
203.94,The reason I started taking Athletic Greens 
205.75,"and the reason I still take Athletic Greens is that, "
207.502,it covers all of my vitamin mineral and probiotic needs. 
211.52,Nowadays there's a lot of data out there 
213.61,pointing to the fact that a healthy gut microbiome 
216.28,"literally, little microbes that live in our gut, "
218.31,that are good for us is important to support 
220.75,"our immune system, our nervous system, our endocrine system, "
223.66,and various aspects of our immediate and long-term health. 
226.54,With Athletic Greens I get all the vitamins and minerals 
229.25,that I need plus the probiotics 
231.72,ensure a healthy gut microbiome. 
233.58,"It also tastes really good, I mix mine up with some water, "
235.99,"a little bit of lemon juice, I'll have that early in the day "
238.27,and sometimes a second time later in the day as well. 
240.77,"It's compatible with intermittent fasting, "
242.305,"it's compatible with vegan diets, with keto diets, "
245.99,and essentially every diet 
247.23,that you could possibly imagine out there. 
249.529,"It's also filled with adaptogens for recovery, "
252.21,"it has digestive enzymes for gut health, "
254.07,and has a number of other things 
255.14,that support the immune system. 
257.55,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
258.93,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
261.47,to claim their special offer. 
262.99,They'll give you five free travel packs 
264.49,that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
266.36,"while you're on the road, "
267.48,and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D
3K,
2.,
270.98,There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin D
3,
273.83,"supports a huge number of metabolic factors, "
277.55,"immune system factors, endocrine factors, "
279.365,"basically, we need vitamin D"
"3,",
281.38,"we can get it from the sun, "
282.72,but many people are deficient in vitamin D
3,
285.23,even if they are getting 
286.43,what they think is sufficient sunlight. 
288.33,And K
2,is important for cardiovascular health. 
290.76,"So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, "
293.65,"you can claim their special offer, "
295.18,"the five free travel packs, "
296.36,plus the year supply of vitamin D
3K,

299.21,Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker. 
302.229,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
304.566,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
307.33,to help you better understand your body 
308.85,and help you reach your health goals. 
310.76,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
313.69,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
315.967,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
318.229,can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. 
321.12,"And now with the advent of modern DNA tests, "
323.62,you can also get information about how your specific genes 
326.22,are impacting your immediate and long-term health. 
328.77,Now a problem with a lot of blood tests 
330.26,"and DNA tests out there, is you get the numbers back "
332.73,"but you don't know what to do with those numbers, "
334.75,with InsideTracker they make it very simple to figure out 
338.05,what to do to bring those numbers into the ranges 
340.37,that are right for you. 
341.61,"They have a dashboard that's very easy to use, "
344.34,"you can see the numbers from your blood and/or DNA tests, "
347.81,"and it will point to specific lifestyle factors, "
349.788,nutritional factors as well as supplementation 
353.3,maybe even prescription factors that would be right for you 
355.96,to bring the numbers into range that are ideal 
357.98,for your immediate and long-term health goals. 
360.4,Another feature the InsideTracker has 
361.761,is their inner age test. 
363.96,This test shows you what your biological age is 
366.24,and compares that to your chronological age 
368.53,"and what you can do to improve your biological age, "
371.26,which of course is the important number. 
373.13,If you'd like to try InsideTracker 
374.51,you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman 
377.12,to get 
25%,off any of InsideTracker's plans. 
380.09,Also an interview I did with Longevity Research Doctor 
383.41,"and InsideTracker's Founder Dr. Gil Blander, "
385.523,"is out now on their podcast, the longevity by design podcast "
389.6,and a link to that interview 
390.75,can be found in today's show notes. 
392.85,Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon. 
395.96,"Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free, "
398.49,keto-friendly cereal. 
400.18,I don't follow a ketogenic diet. 
401.92,The way that I eat is basically geared 
403.84,toward feeling alert when I want to be alert 
406.13,and feeling sleepy when I want to go to sleep. 
408.04,Which for me means fasting until about 
11:,
00,am or noon 
410.66,"most days, then I eat low carb during the day. "
413.97,So I'll have some meat or fish or chicken and some salad 
416.62,"that's what works for me, and in the afternoon, "
418.33,"I remain on a more or less low carb-ish diet, "
421.07,"and then in the evening, I eat pastas and things primarily "
423.687,and I throttle back on the protein 
425.44,and that's what allows me to fall asleep at night. 
427.17,That's just what works for me. 
428.72,"So if I want a snack in the afternoon, "
430.79,I want that to be a ketogenic or low carb snack 
434.1,and that snack these days is Magic Spoon. 
436.86,"Magic Spoon is really terrific, it has zero grams of sugar, "
439.51,
13,to 
14,"grams of protein, "
441.15,and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving. 
444.25,"It's really delicious, "
445.16,"they have a number of different flavors like cocoa, "
447.24,"fruity, peanut butter and frosted, "
449.34,I particularly like frosted. 
451.13,It tastes like donuts and I really like donuts 
453.28,although I try not to eat donuts too often if ever. 
456.58,"What I do lately, is I take Magic Spoon, "
458.61,I put it in some Bulgarian yogurt which is really good 
460.99,"and I mix that up, I put those in there "
461.923,and sometimes I put some cinnamon on them. 
464.03,"And as I'm describing this, "
464.9,I'm getting hungry for Magic Spoon. 
466.21,"So if you want to try Magic Spoon, "
467.99,you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman 
470.95,to get their variety pack. 
472.19,Just use the promo code Huberman at checkout 
474.63,to get $
5,off your order. 
476.34,"Again, that's magicspoon.com/huberman "
479.01,and use the code Huberman to get $
5,off. 
481.78,"And now for my discussion with Dr. David Berson, welcome. "
486.04,- Thank you. - Yeah. 
487.0,- So nice to be here. 
488.16,- Great to have you. 
490.62,For more than 
20,years you've been my go-to source 
493.17,"for all things, nervous system how it works, "
495.92,how it's structured. 
497.14,So today I want to ask you some questions about that. 
500.16,I think people would gain a lot of insight into this machine 
503.88,"that makes them think and feel and see, et cetera. "
508.37,"If you would, could you tell us how we see? "
512.8,"A photon of light enters the eye, what happens? "
517.51,- Right. 
518.343,"- How is it that I look outside, I see a truck drive by, "
521.35,"or I look on the wall I see a photo of my dog, "
525.41,how does that work? 
526.35,"- Right, so this is an old question obviously. "
529.13,"And clearly in the end, "
530.93,the reason you have a visual experience 
532.83,is that your brain is got some pattern of activity 
536.16,that associates with the input from the periphery. 
539.14,But you can have a visual experience 
540.79,with no input from the periphery as well. 
542.59,"When you're dreaming, you're seeing things "
546.05,that aren't coming through your eyes. 
547.49,- Are those memories? 
549.59,- I would say in a sense 
550.76,they may reflect your visual experience 
553.18,"they're not necessarily specific visual memories, "
555.16,but of course they can be. 
556.77,"But the point is, that the experience of seeing "
558.91,is actually a brain phenomenon. 
562.35,"But of course, under normal circumstances, "
564.55,we see the world because we're looking at it 
566.51,and we're using our eyes to look at it. 
568.54,"And fundamentally, when we're looking at the exterior world, "
572.29,it's what the retina is telling the brain that matters. 
575.07,"So there are cells called ganglion cells, "
577.9,these are neurons that are the key cells for communicating 
581.21,"between eye and brain, the eye is like the camera, "
584.45,"it's detecting the initial image, "
586.46,"doing some initial processing, "
587.7,and then that signal gets sent back to the brain proper 
591.53,"and of course, it's there at the level of the cortex "
594.36,that we have this conscious visual experience. 
596.25,There are many other places in the brain 
597.433,that get visual input as well doing other things 
600.94,with that kind of information. 
602.79,- So I get a lot of questions about color vision. 
606.01,"If you would, could you explain "
608.36,how is it that we can perceive reds and greens and blues 
612.35,and things of that sort. 
613.49,"- Right, so the first thing to understand about light, "
616.43,"is that it's just a form of electromagnetic radiation, "
620.98,"it's vibrating, it's oscillating, but. "
623.62,"- When you say it's vibrating, it's oscillating, "
625.58,you mean that photons are actually moving? 
628.5,"- Well in a sense, photons they're certainly moving "
630.66,"through space, we think about photons as particles "
634.47,"and that's one way of thinking about light, "
636.07,"but we can also think of it as a wave like a radio wave, "
639.23,either way is acceptable. 
640.89,And the radio waves have frequencies 
642.6,"like the frequencies on the your radio dial, "
645.28,and certain frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum 
648.094,"can be detected by neurons in the retina, "
651.0,"those are the things we see, "
652.98,but there's still different wavelengths within the light 
655.39,that can be seen by the eye. 
657.8,And those different wavelengths are unpacked in a sense 
660.54,or decoded by the nervous system 
663.57,to lead to our experience of color. 
667.55,"Essentially, different wavelengths give us the sensation "
670.54,of different colors through the auspices 
673.7,of different neurons that are tuned 
675.9,to different wavelengths of light. 
677.7,"- So when a photon, so when a little bit of light "
681.24,"hits my eye goes in, "
683.8,the photoreceptors convert that into electrical signal? 
686.47,- Right. 
687.303,- How is it that a given photon of light 
690.7,"gives me the perception eventually, "
692.41,leads the perception of red versus green versus blue? 
695.2,"- Right, so if you imagine that in the first layer "
700.03,of the retina where this transformation occurs 
702.31,from electromagnetic radiation into neural signals 
706.54,that you have different kinds of sensitive cells 
709.74,"that are expressing, they're making different molecules "
714.02,within themselves for this express purpose 
716.48,of absorbing photons which is the first step 
719.36,"in the process of seeing, now it turns out that altogether, "
723.565,there are about five proteins like this 
726.7,"that we need to think about in the typical retina, "
729.344,but for seeing color really it's three of them. 
731.89,"So they're three different proteins, "
733.34,"each absorbs light with a different preferred frequency, "
737.59,and then the nervous system keeps track of those signals 
742.67,compares and contrasts them to extract some understanding 
745.73,of the wavelength composition of light. 
748.11,"So you can see just by looking at a landscape, "
750.65,or it must be late in the day 
753.39,because things are looking golden 
754.99,that's all a function of our absorbing the light 
758.57,that's coming from the world 
759.695,and interpreting that with our brain 
761.7,because of the different composition of the light 
764.54,that's reaching our eyes. 
765.709,- Is it fair to assume that my perception of red 
768.21,is the same as your perception of red? 
770.23,"- Well, that's a great question. "
771.207,- And that mine is better? 
773.959,"I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. "
774.792,[laughs] 
775.625,"- It's a great question, it's a deep philosophical question. "
777.6,It's a question that really probably can't even ultimately 
779.96,"be answered by the usual empirical scientific processes, "
785.17,'cause it's really about an individual's experience. 
790.3,What we can say is that the biological mechanisms 
794.34,"that we think are important for seeing color for example, "
797.45,seem to be very highly similar 
799.52,"from one individual to the next whether it be human beings, "
802.04,or other animals. 
804.22,And so we think that the physiological process 
807.51,"looks very similar on the front end, "
809.78,but once you're at the level of perception or understanding 
813.117,"or experience, that's something that's a little bit tougher "
817.67,to nail down with the sorts of scientific approaches 
822.57,that we approach biological vision let's say. 
826.09,- You mentioned that there are five different cone types 
829.06,"essentially, the cones being the cells that absorb light "
831.64,of different wavelengths. 
833.82,"I often wondered when I had my dog, "
837.45,what he saw and how his vision differs from our vision. 
841.93,"And certainly, there are animals that can see things "
844.22,that we can't see. 
845.12,- Right? 
845.953,- What are some of the more outrageous examples of that? 
848.581,- I've seen things. 
849.786,- And same things in the extreme. 
852.22,- Right. 
853.55,"- Dogs I'm guessing see reds more as oranges, is that right? "
857.58,'Cause they don't have the same array of of neurons 
861.34,that we have for seeing color. 
862.92,"- Right, so the first thing is, "
864.58,"it's not really five types of colons, "
866.97,there are really three types of colons. 
868.84,And if you look at the way that color vision 
871.16,"is thought to work, you can sort of see "
872.74,that it has to be three different signals. 
875.12,There are a couple of other types of pigments. 
877.3,One is really mostly for dim light vision. 
880.66,When you're walking around in a moonless night 
882.8,and you're seeing things with very low light 
885.73,that's the rod cell that uses its own pigment. 
889.22,And then there's another class of pigments 
891.37,"we'll probably talk about a little bit later, "
892.96,this melanopsin pigment. 
894.39,- I thought you were referring to like ultraviolet 
896.26,and infrared and things like that. 
898.5,"- Right, so in the case of a typical, "
901.67,"well, let's put it this way. "
902.88,"In human beings, most of us have three cone types "
906.54,and we can see colors that stem from that. 
910.84,"In most mammals including your dog or your cat, "
915.9,there really are only two cone types 
918.53,and that limits the kind of vision that they can have 
921.84,in the domain of wavelength or color as you would say. 
925.08,"So really, a dog sees the world kind of like a particular "
928.86,"kind of color blind human might see the world, "
931.73,because instead of having three channels to compare 
933.77,and contrast they only have two channels 
935.76,and that makes it much more difficult to figure out exactly 
938.05,which wavelength you're looking at. 
940.14,- Do colorblind people suffer much as a consequence 
943.1,of being colorblind? 
944.47,"- Well, it's like so many other disabilities. "
950.383,The world is built for people of the most common type. 
954.86,"So in some cases, the expectation can be there "
959.66,that somebody can see something that they won't be able to 
962.0,if they're missing one of their cone types let's say. 
964.45,"So in those moments, that can be a real problem. "
968.73,"If there's a lack of contrast to their visual system, "
972.51,they will be blind to that. 
974.01,"In general, it's a fairly modest visual limitation "
979.43,as things go. 
980.65,"For example, if not being able to see acutely "
983.01,"can be much more damaging, "
984.17,not being able to read fine print for example. 
986.542,"- Yeah, I suppose if I had to give up "
990.0,the ability to see certain colors 
991.65,"or give up the ability to see clearly, "
993.37,I could certainly trade out color for clarity. 
997.53,"- Right, of course, color is very meaningful to us "
999.734,"as human beings, so we would hate to give it up. "
1003.92,"But obviously, dogs and cats and all kinds of other mammals "
1006.58,do perfectly well in the world. 
1008.11,"- Yeah, because we take care of them. "
1009.27,I spent most of my time taking care of that dog. 
1013.15,- He took care of me too. 
1015.28,Let's talk about that odd photopigment. 
1020.88,Photopigment of course being the thing that absorbs light 
1023.55,"of a particular wavelength, "
1025.1,and let's talk about these specialized ganglion cells 
1029.96,that communicate certain types of information 
1032.41,from eye to the brain that are so important 
1035.293,for so many things. 
1036.7,"What I'm referring to here of course is, "
1038.46,your co-discovery of the so-called 
1040.15,"intrinsically photosensitive cells, "
1042.31,the neurons in the eye that do so many of the things 
1045.06,"that don't actually have to do with perception, "
1047.61,but have to do with important biological functions. 
1050.29,What I would love for you to do 
1051.21,is explain to me why once I heard you say 
1055.11,we have a bit of fly eye in our eye. 
1058.67,- Yeah. - And you showed this slide 
1060.19,of a giant fly from a horror movie. 
1063.46,- Yeah. - Trying to attack this woman. 
1065.8,- Yeah. 
1066.633,- And maybe it was an eye also. 
1068.6,So what does it mean that we have a bit of a fly eye 
1072.07,in our eye? 
1074.29,"- Yeah, so this last pigment is a really peculiar one. "
1081.74,One can think about it 
1082.59,as really the initial sensitive element in a system 
1086.01,that's designed to tell your brain 
1088.35,about how bright things are in your world. 
1092.48,"And the thing that's really peculiar about this pigment, "
1095.27,is that it's in the wrong place in a sense. 
1098.45,"When you think about the structure of the retina, "
1100.6,you think about a layer cake essentially. 
1102.56,"You've got this thin membrane at the back of your eye, "
1105.34,but it's actually a stack of thin layers 
1107.83,and the outermost of those layers 
1109.47,is where these photoreceptors 
1110.74,you were talking about earlier are sitting. 
1112.5,"That's where the film of your camera is essentially, "
1115.44,that's where the photons do their magic 
1117.02,with the photo pigments and turn it into a neural signal. 
1119.16,- I like that I've never really thought 
1119.993,"of the photoreceptors is the film of the camera, "
1122.04,but that makes sense. 
1122.93,- Or like the sensitive chip on CCD chip in your cell phone. 
1127.2,It's the surface on which the light pattern is imaged 
1130.12,"by the optics of the eye, "
1132.25,and now you've got an array of sensors 
1134.22,that's capturing that information 
1136.34,"and creating a bitmap essentially, "
1139.09,but now it's in neural signals 
1140.58,distributed across the surface of the retina. 
1143.29,So all of that was known to be going on 
150,"years ago, "
1148.35,a couple of types of photoreceptors cones and rods. 
1150.74,"If you look a little bit more closely, "
1152.4,"three types of cones, that's where the transformation "
1155.6,from electromagnetic radiation to neural signals 
1160.48,was thought to take place. 
1162.52,But it turns out that this last photopigment 
1164.7,"is in the other end of the retina, "
1167.04,"the innermost part of the retina, "
1168.5,that's where the so-called ganglion cells are. 
1170.54,"Those are the cells that talk to the brain, "
1172.15,the ones that actually can communicate directly 
1174.87,what information comes to them from the photoreceptors. 
1178.24,"And here you've got a case where actually, "
1181.15,some of the output neurons 
1182.772,that we didn't think had any business 
1184.79,being directly sensitive to light 
1187.0,"were actually making this photopigment, absorbing light, "
1191.9,and converting that to neural signals 
1193.22,and sending it to the brain. 
1194.571,"So that made it pretty surprising and unexpected, "
1198.64,but there are many surprising things about these cells. 
1201.8,"- So, and what is the relationship to the fly eye? "
1205.24,"- Right, so the link there is, "
1207.37,that if you ask how the photopigment 
1210.64,now communicates downstream 
1213.36,from the initial absorption event 
1215.96,"to get to the electrical signal, "
1217.56,that's a complex cellular process 
1219.283,involves many chemical steps. 
1222.26,"And if you look at how photoreceptors in our eyes work, "
1226.63,"you can see what that cascade is, how that chain works. "
1230.34,If you look in the eyes of flies or other insects 
1234.222,"or other invertebrates, "
1236.67,there's a very similar kind of chain. 
1238.72,But the specifics of how the signals 
1241.24,get from the absorption event by the pigment 
1243.6,to the electrical response 
1244.86,"that the nervous system can understand, "
1247.03,are characteristically different 
1248.91,between fuzzy furry creatures like us 
1253.74,and insects for example like the fly. 
1256.49,- I see. 
1257.323,- So these funny extra photoreceptors 
1259.98,that are in the wrong layer 
1261.73,doing something completely different 
1263.07,are actually using a chemical cascade 
1266.76,that looks much more like what you would see 
1268.31,"in a fly photoreceptor, "
1270.12,"than what you would see in a human photoreceptor, "
1272.9,a rod or a cone for example. 
1274.62,So it sounds like it's a very primitive aspect of biology 
1279.33,that we maintain. 
1280.41,"- Exactly right, exactly. "
1282.13,- And despite the fact that dogs can't see as many colors 
1284.33,"as we can and cats can't see as many colors as we can, "
1286.89,we have all this extravagant stuff for seeing color 
1289.81,and then you got this other pigment 
1291.61,"sitting in the wrong not wrong, "
1293.72,but in a different part of the eye 
1297.0,sending processing light very differently. 
1299.82,- Right. 
1300.653,- And sending that information into the brain. 
1302.49,"So, what do these cells do? "
1306.39,"Presumably, they're there for a reason. "
1307.84,"- They are, and the interesting thing is that, "
1311.91,one cell type like this carrying one kind of signal 
1316.37,"which I would call a brightness signal essentially, "
1320.24,can do many things in the brain. 
1322.15,"- When you say brightness signal you mean that, "
1324.54,"like right now, I have these cells do I have these cells? "
1326.807,Of course. - You do. 
1327.64,"- I'm joking, I hope I have these cells in my eye. "
1329.8,"And they're paying attention to how bright it is overall, "
1332.8,but they're not paying attention 
1333.7,for instance to the edge of area 
1334.99,or what else is going on in the room. 
1336.8,"- Right, so it's the difference "
1338.5,between knowing what the objects are on the table 
1341.78,and knowing whether it's bright enough 
1343.21,to be daylight right now. 
1345.86,So why does your nervous system need to know 
1349.0,whether it's daylight right now? 
1350.75,"Well, one thing that needs to know "
1352.01,that is your circadian clock. 
1354.03,"If you travel across time zones to Europe, "
1357.47,"now your internal clock thinks it's California time, "
1361.97,but the rotation of the earth 
1364.3,is for different part of the planet. 
1366.359,The rising and setting of the sun 
1367.88,is not at all what your body is anticipating. 
1370.29,So you've got an internal representation 
1372.12,"of the rotation of the earth in your own brain, "
1374.64,that's your circadian system it's keeping time. 
1378.68,"But now you've played a trick on your nervous system, "
1381.01,you put yourself in a different place 
1382.11,where the sun is rising at the quote wrong time. 
1385.68,"Well, that's not good for you, right? "
1387.63,So you got to get back on track. 
1388.98,"One of the things this system does, "
1391.26,"is sends a oh, it's daylight now signal to the brain, "
1394.98,which compares with its internal clock. 
1396.86,"And if that's not right, it tweaks the clock gradually "
1400.47,until you get over your jet lag 
1401.86,and you feel back on track again. 
1404.1,"- So the jet lag case makes a lot of sense to me, "
1406.97,"but presumably, these elements didn't evolve for jet lag. "
1411.41,- Right. 
1412.243,"- So, what are they doing on a day-to-day basis? "
1415.87,"- Right, well one way to think about this is that, "
1418.71,"the clock that you have in not just your brain, "
1422.98,"in all the cells, almost all of the cells of your body, "
1425.67,"they're all oscillating, they're all. "
1429.0,- They got local little clocks in them. 
1430.027,"- They got local little clocks in themselves, "
1431.29,they're all clocks. 
1435.14,"They need to be synchronized appropriately, "
1439.9,and the whole thing has to be built in biological machinery. 
1444.66,This is actually a beautiful story about how gene expression 
1449.39,"can control gene expression, and if you set it up right, "
1452.06,you can set up a little thing that just sort of hums along 
1455.47,at a particular frequency. 
1456.575,In our case it's humming along at 
24,"hours, "
1459.32,'cause that's how our earth rotates 
1461.05,and it's all built into our biology. 
1463.46,"So this is great, but the reality is, "
1465.633,that the clock can only be so good. 
1468.04,"I mean, we're talking about biology here. "
1469.6,"It's not precision engineering, "
1472.37,and so it can be a little bit off. 
1474.15,"- Well, also it's in our brain, "
1475.92,so it doesn't have access to any regular unerring signal? 
1479.61,"- Well, if in the absence of the rising "
1482.06,"and setting of the sun it doesn't, "
1483.0,"if you put someone in a cave, "
1485.56,their biological clock will keep time 
1487.83,to within a handful of minutes of 
24,"hours, "
1491.87,that's no problem for one day. 
1495.01,"But if this went on without any correction, "
1497.29,eventually you'd be out of phase 
1499.22,and this is actually one of the things 
1500.49,that blind patients often complain about. 
1503.5,If they've got retinal blindness is insomnia. 
1508.085,[indistinct] 
1510.1,"Exactly, they're not synchronized, their clock is there, "
1513.13,but they're drifting out of phase 
1514.73,because their clock's only good to 
24.2,hours or 
23.8,hours 
1522.06,little by little if they're drifting. 
1524.12,So you need a synchronization signal. 
1526.03,So even if you never across time zones 
1527.677,and of course we didn't back on the Savannah 
1529.68,"we stayed within walking distance of where we were, "
1534.21,"you still need a synchronizer, 'cause otherwise, "
1536.31,you have nothing to actually confirm 
1539.13,"when the rising and the setting of the sun is, "
1541.58,that's what you're trying to synchronize yourself to. 
1544.36,- I'm fascinated by the circadian clock 
1547.12,and the fact that all the cells of our body 
1550.1,have essentially a 
24-hour-ish,clock in them. 
1553.34,- Right. 
1554.45,- We hear a lot about these circadian rhythms 
1556.16,and circadian clocks the fact that we need light input 
1559.18,from these special neurons in order to set the clock. 
1562.3,But I've never really heard it described 
1564.31,how the clock itself works 
1566.49,and how the clock signals to all the rest of the body 
1570.19,when the liver should be doing one thing 
1572.737,and the stomach should be doing another. 
1575.62,I know you've done some work on the clock. 
1578.19,So if you would just maybe briefly describe 
1581.61,"where the clock is, what it does, "
1584.53,and some of the top contour of how it tells the cells 
1588.51,of the body what to do. 
1589.8,"- Right, so the first thing to say is that, as you said, "
1592.89,the clock is all over the place. 
1594.65,Most of the tissues in your body have clocks. 
1597.97,"- We probably have what, millions of clocks in our body. "
1599.66,"- Yeah, I would say that's probably fair. "
1601.98,"If you have millions of cell types, "
1603.35,you might have millions of clocks. 
1606.33,The role of the central pacemaker for the circadian system 
1610.24,is to coordinate all of these. 
1612.77,"And there's a little nucleus, "
1615.9,a little collection of nerve cells in your brain 
1619.293,"it's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus the SCN, "
1623.6,and it is sitting in a funny place 
1625.77,for the rest of the structures in the nervous system 
1627.373,that get direct retinal input. 
1629.61,"It's sitting in the hypothalamus, "
1631.99,which you can think about as sort of the great coordinator 
1635.5,of drives and. 
1638.48,- The source of all our pleasures and all our problems. 
1640.7,- Right. - Or most our problems. 
1642.13,"- Yes, it really is. "
1643.92,But it's sort of deep in your brain 
1646.22,things that drive you to do things. 
1648.03,"If you're freezing cold, you put on a coat, you shiver, "
1651.116,all these things are coordinated by hypothalamus. 
1654.15,So this pathway that we're talking about from the retina 
1657.56,and from these peculiar cells 
1659.67,"that are encoding light intensity, "
1661.84,are sending signals directly into a center 
1665.43,that's surrounded by all of these centers 
1667.94,that control autonomic nervous system 
1671.04,and your hormonal systems. 
1675.03,So this is a part of your visual system 
1677.23,"that doesn't really reach the level of consciousness, "
1679.45,"it's not something you think about, "
1681.87,it's happening under the radar kind of all the time 
1685.06,and the signal is working its way 
1687.48,into this central clock coordinating center. 
1693.21,"Now what happens then is not that well understood, "
1697.35,but it's clear that this is a neural center 
1699.98,that has the same ability to communicate 
1701.73,with other parts of your brain as any other neural center. 
1704.68,"And clearly, there are circuits that involve connections "
1710.29,between neurons that are conventional. 
1714.07,"But in addition, it's quite clear "
1715.33,that there are also sort of humeral effects 
1717.49,that things are being oozing out of the cells in the center 
1721.929,and maybe into the circulation 
1723.9,or just diffusing through the brain to some extent 
1727.64,that can also affect neurons elsewhere. 
1730.65,But the hypothalamus uses everything 
1732.77,to control the rest of the body. 
1734.24,"And that's true, the supracosmetic nucleus "
1736.63,"this circadian center as well, "
1740.1,"it can get its fingers into the autonomic nervous system, "
1743.078,"the humeral system and of course, up to the centers "
1746.67,of the brain that organize coordinated rational behavior. 
1752.16,"So if I understand correctly, "
1754.3,"we have this group of cells, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, "
1756.63,it's got a 
24-hour,"rhythm, "
1759.93,that rhythm is more or less matched 
1761.58,to what's going on in our external world 
1763.84,by the specialized set of neurons in our eye. 
1766.46,"But then the master clock itself the SCN, "
1770.49,releases things in the blood humeral signals 
1774.71,that go out various places in the body. 
1777.83,And you said to the autonomic system 
1779.41,"which is regulating more or less how alert or calm we are, "
1782.15,as well as our thinking and our cognition. 
1785.29,"So I'd love to talk to you about the autonomic part, "
1789.26,"presumably that's through melatonin, "
1792.25,it's through adrenaline how is it that this clock 
1797.72,"is impacting how the autonomic system, "
1800.44,how alert or calm we feel? 
1802.1,"- Right, so there are pathways "
1805.17,by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus can access 
1809.33,both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system. 
1812.3,- Just so people know the sympathetic nervous system 
1814.29,"is the one that tends to make us more alert, "
1816.22,and the parasympathetic nervous system 
1818.14,is the portion of the autonomic nervous system 
1820.92,makes us feel more calm. 
1822.04,- Right. - In broadcasting. 
1823.5,"Right, to first approximation, right? "
1825.82,"So, this is both of these systems "
1828.92,are within the grasp of the circadian system 
1833.09,through hypothalamic circuits. 
1835.06,"One of the circuits that will be I think, "
1837.59,of particular interest to some of your listeners 
1840.07,is a pathway that involves this sympathetic branch 
1843.836,of the autonomic nervous system 
1845.42,the fight or flight system 
1847.77,that is actually through a very circuitous route 
1850.95,innervating the pineal gland 
1852.83,which is sitting in the middle of your brain. 
1855.026,- The so-called third eye. 
1857.01,"- Right, so this is. "
1858.39,"- We'll have to get back to why it's called the third eye, "
1860.64,"because, yeah. "
1861.55,- That's an interesting thing. 
1862.383,- You can't call something the third eye and just. 
1865.28,- Just leave it there. - Just leave it there. 
1866.82,- Right. - Right. 
1868.49,"- Anyway, this is the major source of melatonin "
1870.79,in your body. 
1871.623,- So light comes in to my eye. 
1874.14,- Yes. 
1875.25,- Passed off to the suprachiasmatic nucleus 
1877.61,"essentially, not the light itself, "
1878.92,but the signal representing the light. 
1881.27,- Sure. 
1882.103,"- Then the SCN, the suprachiasmatic nucleus "
1884.34,can impact the melatonin system. 
1887.21,- Right. - Via the pineal? 
1888.49,"- Right, the way this is seen is that, "
1890.65,if you were to measure your melatonin level 
1893.92,"over the course of the day, "
1895.32,"if you could do this hour by hour, "
1898.18,"you'd see that it's really low during the day, "
1900.52,very high at night. 
1902.21,But if you get up in the middle of the night 
1904.15,and go to the bathroom 
1904.983,"and turn on the bright full fluorescent light, "
1907.13,your melatonin level is slammed to the floor. 
1909.5,Light is directly impacting your hormonal levels 
1914.36,through this mechanism that we just described. 
1917.18,So this is one of the routes 
1918.342,by which light can act on your hormonal status 
1923.46,through pathways that are completely beyond 
1926.43,"what you normally would think about, right? "
1928.46,You're thinking about the things in the bathroom. 
1930.55,"Oh, there's the toothbrush, there's the tube of toothpaste. "
1933.83,"But meanwhile, this other system is just counting photons "
1937.68,"and saying oh wow, there's a lot of photons right now "
1940.1,let's shut down the melatonin release. 
1942.46,- This is one of the main reasons why I've encouraged people 
1945.28,to avoid bright light exposure in the middle of the night. 
1948.32,"Not just blue light, but bright light of any wavelength, "
1952.12,because there's this myth out there that blue light 
1954.81,because it's the optimal signal for activating this pathway 
1957.71,"and shutting down melatonin, "
1959.52,is the only wavelength of light that can shut it down. 
1963.42,But am I correct in thinking that 
1965.38,if a light is bright enough. 
1966.82,- Right. 
1967.653,"- It doesn't matter if it's blue light, green light, "
1969.31,"purple light, even red light. "
1970.97,- Right. 
1971.803,- You're going to slam melatonin down to the ground 
1974.73,which is not a good thing to happen 
1976.98,in the middle of the night. 
1977.813,- Right. - Correct? 
1978.646,"Right, yeah, any light will affect the system "
1982.29,"to some extent, the blue light is somewhat more effective, "
1986.44,but don't fool yourself into thinking 
1989.01,that if you use red light 
1989.93,"that means you're avoiding the effect, "
1992.178,it's certainly still there. 
1994.46,"And certainly, if it's very bright, "
1995.66,it'll be more effective in driving the system 
1998.45,than dim blue light would be. 
2000.06,"- Interesting, a lot of people wear blue blockers. "
2002.227,- Right. 
2003.61,"- And in a kind of odd twist of misinformation out there, "
2008.47,a lot of people wear blue blockers 
2009.71,"during the middle of the day, "
2011.12,which basically makes no sense 
2012.92,because during the middle of the day 
2014.06,is when you want to get a lot of bright light 
2016.9,"and including blue light into your eyes, correct? "
2019.42,"- Absolutely, and not just for the reasons "
2021.92,"we've been talking about in terms of circadian effects, "
2024.53,there are major effects of light on mood. 
2028.2,"And seasonal affective disorder apparently, "
2031.87,is essentially a reflection of this same system in reverse. 
2035.84,If you're living in the northern climes 
2038.69,and you're not getting that much light 
2040.61,"during the middle of the winter in Stockholm, "
2045.09,you might be prone to depression 
2046.57,and phototherapy might be just the ticket for you 
2049.42,"and that's because there's a direct effect of light on mood, "
2053.054,there's an example where if you don't have enough light 
2056.127,it's a problem. 
2057.65,So I think you're exactly right. 
2058.71,"It's not about is like good or bad for you, "
2060.41,it's about what kind of light and when 
2063.855,that makes the difference. 
2065.129,"Yeah, the general rule of thumb that I've been living by, "
2067.27,is to get as much bright light in my eyes 
2069.11,ideally from sunlight anytime I want to be alert. 
2072.67,- Right. 
2073.503,- And doing exactly the opposite when I want to be asleep. 
2075.99,- Yeah. - We're getting drowsy. 
2077.32,- And there are aspects of this that spin out 
2080.88,way beyond the conversation we're having now 
2082.66,to things like this. 
2084.37,It turns out that the incidence of myopia. 
2087.58,"- Nearsightedness. - Nearsightedness, right. "
2090.84,Is strongly related to the amount of time 
2093.59,that kids spend outdoors. 
2096.076,- In what direction of effect? 
2097.77,"- The more they spend time outdoors, "
2099.83,the less nearsightedness they have. 
2102.16,- So this is not because they're viewing things 
2103.9,"at a distance, "
2104.733,"or because they're getting a lot of blue light, sunlight? "
2107.1,"- It's a great question, it is not fully resolved "
2110.18,"what the epidemiological, "
2111.62,"what the basis of that epidemiological finding is, "
2114.4,one possibility is the amount of light 
2116.19,which would make me think 
2117.13,about this melanopsin system again. 
2119.97,But it might very well be a question of accommodation 
2122.355,that is the process by which you focus on near or far things 
2125.97,"if you're never outdoors, everything is nearby. "
2128.36,"If you're outdoors, you're focusing far, so this is. "
2130.358,- Or unless you are on your phone? 
2131.57,"- Right, exactly. "
2132.9,- There's a tremendous amount of interest these days 
2136.04,in watches and things that count steps. 
2139.58,I'm beginning to realize 
2140.84,that we should probably have a device that can count photons 
2144.68,during the day. 
2145.513,- Right. 
2146.346,- And can also count photons at night 
2147.63,"and tell us hey, you're getting too many photons, "
2149.43,"you're going to shut down your melatonin at night, "
2151.05,"or you're not getting enough photons, "
2152.36,"today you didn't get enough bright light, "
2153.9,whether or not it's from artificial light or from sunlight. 
2156.376,"I guess that, where would you put? "
2158.409,I guess you put on the top of your head 
2159.242,or you'd probably want it someplace outward facing? 
2162.64,"- Right, probably what you need is as many photons "
2165.59,over as much of the retina as possible 
2167.28,to recruit as much of the system as possible. 
2171.36,- In thinking about other effects 
2172.65,of this non-image forming pathway 
2176.12,"that involves these special cells in the eye and the SCN, "
2179.8,you had a paper a few years ago 
2181.58,looking at retinal input to an area of the brain 
2187.92,"which has a fancy name the peri-habenular, "
2190.79,but names don't necessarily matter 
2193.03,that had some important effects on mood 
2196.41,and other aspects of light. 
2199.49,Maybe you could tell us a little bit 
2200.45,about what is the peri-habenular? 
2202.82,"- Oh, wow, so that's a fancy term, "
2205.13,"but I think the way to think about this, "
2207.08,is a chunk of the brain 
2209.69,that is sitting as part of a bigger chunk 
2212.72,that's really the linker between peripheral sensory input 
2217.16,"of all kinds, virtually all kinds, "
2221.11,whether it's auditory input or tactile input 
2225.63,or visual input to the region of your brain the cortex 
2229.24,that allows you to think about these things 
2230.793,and make plans around them and to integrate them 
2233.807,and that kind of thing. 
2236.834,"So, we've known about a pathway "
2242.42,that gets from the retina through this sort of linker center 
2247.72,"which it's called the thalamus, and then. "
2250.245,[indistinct] 
2251.605,"Exactly, but you want to arrive at the destination. "
2254.25,Right now you're at grand central 
2255.46,and now you can do your thing 
2256.74,'cause you're up at the cortex. 
2258.34,So this is the standard pattern. 
2260.13,"You have sensory input coming from the periphery, "
2261.87,you've got these peripheral elements 
2263.4,that are doing the initial stages of. 
2265.97,"- The eye, the ear, the nose. "
2266.803,"- Your skin of your fingertips, right? "
2269.878,The taste buds on your tongue 
2271.51,they're taking this raw information in 
2274.594,and they're doing some pre-processing 
2276.5,maybe or the early circuits are. 
2278.9,"But eventually, most of these signals "
2280.41,have to pass through the gateway to the cortex 
2282.68,which is the thalamus. 
2284.68,"And we've known for years, for decades, many decades, "
2288.842,what the major throughput pathway from the retina 
2291.77,to the cortex is and where it ends up. 
2294.51,It ends up in the visual cortex. 
2296.04,You pat the back of your head 
2297.3,that's where the receiving center is 
2300.82,for the main pathway from retina to cortex. 
2303.84,"But wait a minute, there's more. "
2305.69,There's this little side pathway 
2307.392,that goes through a different part 
2308.55,of that linking thalamus center. 
2311.662,[indistinct] 
2312.78,- Like a local train. 
2313.82,- Yeah. - From grand central to. 
2315.103,"- It's in a weird part of the neighborhood, right? "
2317.6,"It's a completely different, it's like a little trunk line "
2320.52,that branches off and goes out into the hinterlands 
2323.63,and it's going to the part of this linker center 
2326.46,that's talking to a completely different part of cortex 
2328.82,"way up front, frontal lobe, "
2331.31,"which is much more involved in things like planning, "
2334.11,or self-image or. 
2337.369,"- Self-image literally, how one. "
2339.01,"- Views oneself, do you feel good about yourself, "
2342.92,or what's your plan for next Thursday. 
2348.129,It's a very high level center 
2351.04,in the highest level of your nervous system 
2353.6,and this is the region that is getting input 
2356.07,from this pathway which is mostly worked out in its function 
2359.843,by [indistinct] Tara's Lab. 
2361.34,I know you had him on the podcast. 
2363.18,- We didn't talk about this path. 
2364.23,- This pathway at all right. 
2365.67,So Dale Fernandez and [indistinct] 
2369.52,"and the folks that work with them, "
2372.11,were able to show that this pathway doesn't just exist 
2375.02,and get you to a weird place. 
2376.83,"But if you activate it at kind of the wrong time of day, "
2383.03,animals can become depressed. 
2385.36,"And if you silence it under the right circumstances, "
2388.75,then weird lighting cycles that would normally make them act 
2393.7,"sort of depressed, no longer have that effect. "
2397.56,- So it sounds to me like there's this pathway from eye 
2400.7,to this unusual train route through the structure 
2405.19,"we call the thalamus, "
2406.78,then up to the front of the brain 
2408.16,"that relates to things of self-perception, "
2411.65,kind of higher level functions. 
2413.4,"I find that really interesting, "
2414.49,because most of what I think about 
2415.363,"when I think about these fancy, "
2417.76,"well, or these primitive rather, "
2420.32,"neurons that don't pay attention to the shapes of things, "
2422.89,"but instead to brightness I think of well, "
2425.04,"it regulates melatonin and circadian clock, "
2427.53,"mood, hunger, the really kind of vegetative stuff "
2431.73,if you will. - Right. 
2432.563,- And this is interesting because I think a lot of people 
2436.83,experience depression 
2437.91,not just people that live in Scandinavia 
2440.68,"in the middle of winter, and we are very much divorced "
2445.13,from our normal interactions with light. 
2448.87,It also makes me realize 
2449.82,that these intrinsically photosensitive cells 
2451.956,"that set the clock et cetera, "
2453.82,are involved in a lot of things. 
2457.17,They seem to regulate a dozen 
2459.8,or more different basic functions. 
2462.97,I want to ask you about a different aspect 
2465.24,"of the visual system now, "
2466.92,which is the one that relates to our sense of balance. 
2470.92,So I love boats but I hate being on them. 
2473.64,"I love the ocean from shore, "
2475.42,"because I get incredibly seasick, it's awful. "
2479.57,I think I'm going to get seasick if I think about it too much. 
2481.632,[laughs] 
2482.465,"And once I went on a boat trip, "
2483.33,I came back and I actually got motion sick or wasn't seasick 
2488.46,'cause I was rafting. 
2490.29,So there's a system that somehow gets messed up. 
2493.56,They always tell us if you're feeling sick 
2494.76,"to look at the horizon et cetera, et cetera. "
2497.16,- Right. - So what is the link 
2498.23,between our visual system and our balance system 
2500.74,and why does it make us nauseous sometimes 
2503.37,when the world is moving in a way 
2505.7,that we're not accustomed to? 
2507.13,- Right. 
2507.963,"- I realize this is a big question, "
2508.9,"because it involves eye movement, et cetera. "
2511.49,- Right. - But let's maybe just walk in 
2513.6,"at the simplest layers of vision, vestibular, "
2519.82,so-called balance system 
2521.35,and then maybe we can piece the system together for people 
2524.32,"so that they can understand, "
2525.18,and then also we should give them some tools 
2526.88,for adjusting their nausea 
2528.64,when their vestibular system is out of whack. 
2532.0,"- Cool, so the first thing to think about "
2533.543,is that the vestibular system is designed to allow you 
2541.84,to see how your or detect sense 
2545.72,"how you're moving in the world, through the world. "
2551.03,It's a funny one because it's about your movement 
2554.36,"in relationship to the world in a sense, "
2556.3,and yet it's sort of interoceptive 
2558.84,in the sense that it is really 
2562.08,in the end sensing the movement of your own body. 
2566.17,"- Okay, so interoception "
2567.16,we should probably delineate for people 
2568.5,is when you're focusing on your internal state 
2570.7,as opposed to something outside you. 
2572.14,- Right. 
2573.53,- It's a gravity sensing system. 
2575.32,"- Well, it's partly a gravity sensing system "
2577.54,in the sense that gravity is a force that's acting on you 
2582.76,as if you were moving through the world 
2585.38,in the opposite direction. 
2586.52,"- All right, now you got to explain that. "
2588.342,You got to explain that to me. 
2590.43,"- Okay, so basically the idea is that, "
2594.57,"if we leave gravity inside, we're just sitting in a car, "
2600.42,in the passenger seat and the driver hits the accelerator 
2604.48,"and you start moving forward, you sense that. "
2606.73,"If your eyes were closed, you'd sense it. "
2608.4,"If your ears were plugged in, your eyes would close, "
2610.56,you'd still know it. 
2611.73,"- Yeah, many people take off on the plane like this "
2613.88,they're dreading the flight 
2615.09,and they know when the plane is taking off. 
2616.92,"- Sure, that's your vestibular system talking, "
2618.91,because anything that jostles you out 
2621.2,of the current position you're in right now 
2623.07,will be detected by the vestibular system pretty much. 
2627.79,"So this is a complicated system, "
2629.61,but it's basically in your inner ear 
2632.86,very close to where you're hearing. 
2634.044,- That they put it there. 
2636.894,And I don't know. 
2638.018,"- And I don't really know, they're sort of derived. "
2639.242,[indistinct] 
2640.075,- Now I'm just kidding. 
2641.43,"To steal our friend Russ Van Gelder's explanation, "
2643.97,we weren't consulted the design phase and no one. 
2646.421,- That's a great [indistinct]. 
2650.02,- But it's interesting it's in the ear. 
2651.74,- Yeah. - Right? 
2653.28,"- Yeah, it's deep in there "
2654.65,and it's served by the same nerve actually 
2658.52,that serves the hearing system. 
2660.63,One way to think about it is both the hearing system 
2663.43,and this vestibular self-motion sensing system 
2666.87,are really detecting the signal 
2668.287,in the same way they're hairy cells and they're exciting. 
2672.255,[indistinct] 
2673.465,"- Yeah, sort of they got little cilia sticking up "
2675.29,off the surfaces. 
2676.83,"And depending on which way you bend those, "
2678.73,"the cells will either be inhibited or excited, "
2681.11,they're not even neurons but then they talk to neurons 
2684.07,with a neuron-like process and off you go. 
2686.13,Now you've got an auditory signal 
2687.56,if you're sensing things bouncing around in your cochlea 
2691.5,which is. - Sound waves. 
2693.11,- Sympathetically the bouncing of your eardrum 
2695.78,which is symmetrically the sound waves in the world. 
2698.597,"But in the case of the vestibular apparatus, "
2701.28,evolution has built a system 
2702.71,that detects the motion of say fluid going by those hairs. 
2707.87,And if you put a sensor like that in a tube 
2711.3,"that's fluid filled, "
2713.06,now you've got a sensor that will be activated 
2714.604,when you rotate that tube around the axis 
2718.81,"that passes through the middle of it, "
2720.02,those we're just listening won't be able. 
2722.391,[indistinct] 
2723.55,- I was thinking of it as three hula hoops. 
2725.45,"- Right, three hoops. "
2726.283,"- One standing up, one lying down on the ground. "
2728.28,- Right. 
2729.113,- The other one the other way. 
2730.353,"- Three directions, the people who fly "
2733.47,will talk about roll pitch and you all that kind of thing. 
2735.82,So three axes of encoding just like in the. 
2739.852,[indistinct] 
2740.685,"- Sort of the yes, the no "
2742.23,and then I always say it's the puppy head tilt. 
2744.42,"- Yeah, that puppy tilt. "
2745.285,- That's the other one. 
2746.73,"So the point is that, "
2747.924,your brain is eventually going to be able to unpack 
2752.29,what these sensors are telling you 
2754.66,about how you just rotated your head 
2757.14,in very much the way that the three types of cones 
2759.5,we were talking about before 
2761.53,are reading the incoming photons 
2764.92,"in the wavelength domain differently, and if. "
2767.025,"- Red, green, blue. "
2768.065,"- Yeah, you can compare and trust you get red, green, blue. "
2769.98,So same basic idea if you have three sensors 
2773.13,"and you array them properly, "
2774.64,"now you can tell if you're rotating your head left or right, "
2777.22,up or down that's the sensory signal 
2780.68,coming back into your brain 
2783.34,confirming that you've just made a movement that you will. 
2786.6,- But what about on the plane? 
2787.73,"Because when I'm on the plane, "
2788.7,I'm completely stationary the plane's moving. 
2790.81,- Right. 
2791.643,- But my head hasn't moved. - Right. 
2792.476,"- So I'm just moving forward, gravity is constant. "
2795.61,- Exactly. 
2796.443,- How do I know I'm accelerating? 
2797.92,- So what's happening now 
2798.99,"is your brain is sensing the motion, "
2802.45,"and the brain is smart enough also to ask itself, "
2805.97,did I will that movement or did that come from the outside? 
2810.58,So now in terms of sort of understanding 
2812.56,"what the the vestibular signal means, "
2814.72,it's got to be embedded in the context 
2816.34,"of what you tried to do, "
2817.92,or what your other sensory systems are telling you 
2821.76,about what's happening. 
2822.77,"- I see, so it's very interesting. "
2824.939,"But it's not conscious or at least if it's conscious, "
2827.7,"it's very not conscious, it's definitely very fast, right? "
2831.58,"The moment that plane starts moving, "
2832.86,I know that I didn't get up out of my chair and run forward. 
2835.32,- Right. 
2836.153,- But I'm not really thinking about 
2836.986,getting up out of my chair I just know. 
2838.862,"- I guess the way i think about it is that, "
2841.56,"the nervous system is quote, aware at many levels "
2847.48,when it gets all the way up to the cortex 
2849.01,"and we're thinking about it, "
2850.46,"you're talking about it, that's cortical. "
2854.19,But the lower levels of the brain 
2857.42,that don't require you to actually actively think about it 
2860.45,"they're just doing their thing are also made aware, right? "
2864.049,A lot of this is happening under the surface 
2865.93,"of what you're thinking, these are reflexes. "
2868.8,"- Okay, so we've got this gravity sensing system? "
2872.47,- Right. 
2875.879,- I'm nodding for those that are listening 
2877.14,"for a yes movement of the head, "
2879.22,a no movement of the head or the tilting of the head 
2881.57,from side to side. - Right. 
2882.76,- And then you said that knowledge about whether or not 
2886.2,"activation of that system comes from my own movements, "
2889.01,or something acting upon me like the plane moving. 
2892.16,- Right. 
2892.993,- Has to be combined with other signals. 
2895.68,"And so, how is the visual information "
2899.62,or information about the visual world 
2901.09,combined with balance information? 
2902.91,"- Right, so yeah. "
2905.183,I guess maybe the best way to think about 
2907.35,"how these two systems work together, "
2910.0,is to think about what happens when you suddenly 
2912.45,rotate your head to the left. 
2915.19,"When you suddenly rotate your head to the left, "
2916.65,your eyes are actually rotating to the right. 
2919.82,"Automatically, you do this in complete darkness. "
2923.28,If you had an infrared camera and watched yourself 
2928.12,"in complete darkness, you can't see anything. "
2929.82,"Rotating your head to the left, "
2930.82,your eyes would rotate to the right. 
2932.5,"That's your vestibular system saying, "
2936.021,I'm going to try to compensate for the head rotation. 
2941.01,So my eyes are still looking in the same place. 
2944.18,"Why is that useful, well, if it's always doing that, "
2948.45,then the image of the world on your retina 
2950.28,will be pretty stable most of the time 
2952.85,and that actually helps vision. 
2954.84,- Have they built this into cameras for image stabilization 
2958.34,"'cause when I move, when I take a picture with my phone, "
2960.42,"it's blurry, it's not clear? "
2962.49,"- Well actually, you might want to get a better phone, "
2965.65,because now what they have is software in the better apps 
2969.66,that will do a kind of image stabilization post-hoc 
2972.65,by doing a registration of the images 
2974.047,"that are bouncing around, "
2975.78,"they say the edge of the house was here, "
2978.24,so let's get that aligned in each of your images. 
2980.59,So you may not be aware if you're using a good new phone 
2984.77,"that if you walk around a landscape and hold your phone, "
2990.16,that there's all this image stabilization going on. 
2992.99,"But it's built into standard cinematic technology now, "
2997.936,"because if we tried to do a handheld camera, "
3000.21,"things would be bouncing around, "
3001.58,"things would be unwatchable, "
3002.79,you wouldn't be able to really understand 
3004.14,what's going on in the scene. 
3005.56,So the brain works really hard 
3008.72,to mostly stabilize the image of the world on your retina 
3011.887,and of course you're moving through the world 
3013.5,so you can't stabilize everything. 
3014.87,"But the more you can stabilize most of the time, "
3017.74,the better you can see. 
3019.06,And that's why when we're scanning a scene 
3022.84,"looking around at things, "
3024.62,we're making very rapid eye movements 
3026.84,"for very short periods of time and then we just rest, "
3030.44,but we're not the only ones that do that. 
3031.93,"If you ever watch a hummingbird, "
3033.12,"it does exactly the same thing at a feeder, right? "
3035.358,[indistinct] 
3036.191,It is with its body. 
3037.04,"It's going to make a quick movement, "
3039.89,and then it's going to be stable. 
3041.45,"And when you watch a pigeon walking on the sidewalk, "
3044.53,it does this funny head bobbing thing. 
3046.157,"But what it's really doing, "
3047.22,is racking its head back on its neck 
3048.681,while its body goes forward 
3051.28,so that the image of the visual world stays static. 
3054.39,- Is that why they're doing it? 
3055.658,"- Yes, and you've seen the funny chicken videos "
3058.78,"on YouTube, right? "
3059.613,- You take a chicken move it up and down 
3061.14,"the head stays in one place, it's all the same thing. "
3063.71,All of these animals are trying hard 
3066.21,to keep the image of the world stable on their retina 
3068.82,as much of the time as they possibly can. 
3070.88,"And then when they've got to move, make it fast, "
3073.32,make it quick and then stabilize again. 
3075.38,- That's why the pigeons have their head back? 
3076.92,"- It is, yeah. "
3078.06,- Wow. - Yeah. 
3079.54,- I just need to pause there for a second 
3081.718,"and digest that, amazing. "
3085.271,In case people aren't. 
3087.86,"Well, there's no reason why people would know "
3090.12,"what we're doing here, but essentially, "
3091.36,what we're doing is we're building up from sensory 
3094.74,"light onto the eye, make color to what the brain does "
3098.48,"with the integration of that circadian clock, "
3101.34,"melatonin, et cetera. "
3102.173,And now what we're doing 
3103.006,is we're talking about multi-sensory or multimodal 
3105.83,combining one sense vision with another sense balance. 
3109.897,- Right. 
3110.73,- And it turns out that pigeons 
3112.8,"know more about this than I do, "
3114.07,because pigeons know to keep their head back 
3116.29,as they walk forward. - Right. 
3117.99,"- All right, so that gets us to this issue "
3120.7,of motion sickness. - Right. 
3122.56,- And you don't have to go out on a boat. 
3125.71,"Anytime I go to New York, I sit in an Uber "
3128.12,or in a cab in the back. 
3129.45,"And if I'm looking at my phone while the car is driving, "
3133.26,I feel nauseous by time I arrive at my destination. 
3136.29,- Right. 
3137.123,"- I always try and look out the front of the windshield, "
3139.5,because I'm told that helps but it's a little tiny window. 
3142.3,- Right. 
3143.133,- And I end up feeling slightly less sick if I do that. 
3147.0,So what's going on with the vision and the balance system 
3152.29,that causes a kind of a nausea? 
3154.33,"And actually, if I keep talking about this. "
3155.68,[indistinct] 
3156.513,[laughs] 
3157.346,"I don't throw up easily, but for some reason motion sickness "
3161.54,is a real thing for me. 
3162.61,- It's a problem for a lot of people. 
3164.623,"I think the fundamental problem typically, "
3167.13,when you get motion sick 
3168.32,is what they call visual vestibular conflict. 
3172.75,"That is, you have two sensory systems "
3175.35,that are talking to your brain 
3176.49,about how you're moving through the world. 
3178.5,And as long as they agree you're fine. 
3182.43,"So if you're driving, "
3184.12,your body senses that you're moving forward. 
3187.16,Your vestibular system is picking up 
3189.92,"this acceleration of the car, "
3192.168,and your visual system is seeing the consequences 
3194.606,of forward motion in the sweeping of the scene past you. 
3199.4,"Everything is honky-dory, right, no problem. "
3201.819,But when you are headed forward 
3205.62,"but you're looking at your cell phone, "
3206.9,what is your retina seeing? 
3208.106,Your retina is seeing the stable image of the screen. 
3210.33,There's absolutely no motion in that. 
3213.57,- Or the motion is just or some other emotion like a movie. 
3216.315,"- If you're playing a game or you're watching a video, "
3219.25,"a football game, the motion is uncoupled "
3221.7,with what's actually happening to your body. 
3224.34,"Your brain doesn't like that, "
3225.61,your brain likes everything to be aligned. 
3228.32,"And if it's not, it's going to complain to you. "
3230.301,- By making me feel nauseous. 
3231.703,- By making you feel nauseous 
3232.536,and maybe you'll change your behavior. 
3233.91,So you're getting. - I'm getting punished. 
3235.85,"- Yeah, for setting it up. "
3237.991,[indistinct] 
3239.35,- Right. - By the vestibular? 
3241.16,- You'll learn. - Visuals. 
3242.252,[laughs] 
3244.18,"In time, I love it. "
3246.47,I love the idea of reward signals 
3248.6,and we've done a lot of discussion about this 
3250.74,"on this podcast of things like dopamine reward and things, "
3253.17,but also punishment signals and I love this example. 
3258.04,"Well, maybe marching a little bit further "
3260.053,"along this pathway, "
3262.91,visual input is combined with balance input. 
3266.92,"Where does that occur, "
3268.37,and maybe 'cause I have some hint of where it occurs. 
3272.19,You could tell us a little bit 
3273.24,about this kind of mysterious little mini-brain 
3277.58,"that they call the cerebellum. - Cerebellum, yeah. "
3280.14,So the way I tried to describe the cerebellum to my students 
3286.56,"is that, it serves sort of like "
3289.14,the air traffic control system functions in air travel. 
3294.55,So that it's a system that's very complicated 
3297.241,and it's really dependent on great information. 
3301.1,So it's taking in information 
3302.32,about everything that's happening everywhere 
3304.67,"not only through your sensory systems, "
3307.69,but it's listening into all the little centers 
3310.15,elsewhere in your brain 
3311.14,that are computing what you're going to be doing next 
3312.8,and so forth. 
3313.633,So it's just ravenous for that kind of information. 
3315.76,- So it really is like a little mini-brain. 
3317.73,"- It is, it's got access to all those signals. "
3323.61,and it really has an important role in coordinating 
3327.56,"and shaping movements, but if you suddenly eliminated "
3333.347,"the air traffic control system, "
3336.5,planes could still take off and land 
3338.98,but you might have some unhappy accidents in the process. 
3344.15,So the cerebellum is kind of like that. 
3345.89,It's not that you would be paralyzed 
3348.2,if your cerebellum was gone 
3349.94,"because you still have motor neurons, "
3351.38,"you still have ways to talk to your muscles, "
3354.16,"you still have reflex centers, "
3356.47,and it's not like you would have any sensory laws 
3359.84,because you still have your cortex 
3361.5,getting all of those beautiful signals 
3363.05,"that you can think about, "
3365.01,but you wouldn't be coordinating things so well anymore. 
3369.42,The timing between input and output might be off. 
3372.91,Or if you were trying to practice a new athletic move 
3376.7,"like an overhead serve in tennis, "
3379.29,you'd be just terrible at learning. 
3383.09,All the sequences of muscle movements 
3385.27,and the feedback from your sensory apparatus 
3387.37,that would let you really hit that ball exactly 
3389.85,"where you wanted to after the nth rep, right? "
3392.522,Now 
1000th,rep or something you get much better at it. 
3396.11,So the cerebellum is all involved 
3397.46,in things like motor learning and refining the precisions 
3403.079,of movement so that they get you where you want to go 
3407.21,if you reach for a glass of champagne 
3409.95,that you don't knock it over or stop short. 
3413.542,[indistinct] 
3414.58,- People who have selective damage to the cerebellum. 
3417.31,- Absolutely. - And I'm familiar with. 
3422.02,"Well, Korsakoff's is different, right? "
3424.45,Isn't that a B vitamin deficiency in chronic alcoholics? 
3427.57,- Right. - And they tend to walk 
3429.23,kind of bow-legged and they can't coordinate their movements. 
3432.122,That has some that not memory bodies but also a cerebellum? 
3436.46,- I'm not sure about the cerebellar involvement there. 
3439.06,But the typical thing would be a patient 
3443.88,"who has a cerebral or stroke or a tumor for example, "
3448.69,might be not that steady on their feet 
3453.09,if the dynamics of the situation you're standing 
3457.621,"on a street car with no handle pull to hold on to, "
3460.84,they might not be as good at adjusting 
3462.99,all the little movements of the car. 
3467.059,There's a kind of tremor that can occur 
3469.34,"as they're reaching for things, "
3472.04,because they reach a little too far 
3473.57,"and then they over correct and come back, things like that. "
3477.51,So it's very common neurological phenomenon actually. 
3483.609,"Cerebellar ataxia is what the neurologists call it, "
3487.25,"and it can happen not just with cerebellar damage, "
3489.16,but damage to the tracts that feed the information 
3491.44,into the cerebellum. 
3492.273,"- Right, it is the private structure. "
3493.106,"- Exactly, or output from the cerebellum. "
3495.03,"- And so, the cerebellum is where a lot of visual "
3497.87,and balance information is combined. 
3499.9,"- In a very key place in the cerebellum, "
3501.96,which it's really one of the oldest parts. 
3506.31,"- In terms of flocculus. - The flocculus, right. "
3509.592,It's a critical place in the cerebellum where visual 
3513.17,and vestibular information comes together 
3515.35,recording just the kinds of movements we were talking about. 
3518.27,This image stabilizing network it's all happening there. 
3521.87,And there's learning happening there as well. 
3523.61,So that if your vestibular apparatus 
3525.91,"is a little bit damaged somehow, "
3528.84,your visual system is actually talking to your cerebellum 
3532.81,"saying there's a problem here, there's an error, "
3535.87,and your cerebellum is learning to do better 
3538.82,by increasing the output of the vestibular system 
3541.26,to compensate for whatever that loss was. 
3543.68,So it's a little error correction system 
3545.33,that's sort of typical of a cerebellar function 
3548.4,"and it can happen in many, many different domains. "
3550.17,This is just one of the domains of sensory motor integration 
3553.48,that takes place there. 
3556.32,- So I should stay off my phone in the Ubers. 
3558.7,"if I'm on a boat, I should essentially look "
3562.3,and as much as possible act as if I'm driving the machine. 
3565.421,- Right. - That'd be weird 
3567.1,if I was in the passenger seat 
3568.17,pretending I was driving the machine. 
3569.48,But i do always feel better 
3570.65,if I'm sitting in the front seat passenger. 
3572.69,"- Right, so more of the visual world that you can see "
3575.78,as if you were actually the one doing the motion 
3577.903,I would think. 
3579.43,- Let's stay in the inner ear for a minute 
3581.03,as we continue to march around the nervous system. 
3586.38,When you take off in the plane or when you land 
3588.51,"or sometimes in the middle of there, "
3590.08,"your ears get clogged or at least my ears get clogged, "
3594.52,that's because of pressure buildup in the various tubes 
3597.6,"of the inner ear, et cetera, we'll get into this. "
3600.37,"But years ago, our good friend Harvey Karten, "
3605.13,is a another world-class neuroanatomist 
3609.93,gave a lecture and talked about how plugging your nose 
3613.7,and blowing out versus plugging your nose and sucking in 
3618.75,should be done at different times 
3620.14,depending on whether or not you're taking off or landing. 
3623.65,And I always see people trying to unpop their ears. 
3626.36,- Right. - And when you do scuba diving 
3628.38,you learn how to do this without necessarily I can do it 
3631.41,by just kind of moving my jaw now 
3632.91,'cause I've done a little bit of diving. 
3635.52,But what's the story there? 
3637.75,We don't have to get into all the differences 
3639.86,"in atmospheric pressure, et cetera, "
3641.18,"but if I'm taking off and my ears are plugged, "
3644.056,"I've recently ascended, plane take off, my ears are plugged, "
3647.34,"do I plug my nose and blow out, "
3648.58,or do I plug my nose and suck in? 
3649.99,"- Right, so the basic idea is that, "
3652.09,if your ears feel bad because you're going into an area 
3657.23,"of higher pressure, so if they pressurize the cabin "
3661.05,more than the pressure that you have on the surface 
3662.724,"of the planet, your eardrums will be bending in "
3666.04,and they don't like that. 
3667.06,If you push them more they'll hurt even more. 
3668.69,- It's a good description that the pressure goes up 
3671.64,then they're going to bend in. 
3673.013,- Bend in and then reverse would be true 
3674.7,if you go into an area of low pressure. 
3676.68,So if you knew you started to drive up the mountain side 
3680.06,"the pressure's getting lower and lower outside, "
3682.17,now the air behind your eardrum is ballooning out. 
3685.514,- Yep. - Right? 
3686.91,So it's just a question 
3687.743,of are you trying to get more pressure or less pressure 
3690.25,behind the eardrum and there's a little tube that does that 
3692.547,and comes down into back your throat there. 
3695.6,"And if you force pressure up that tube, "
3697.296,you're going to be putting more air pressure 
3699.55,into the compartment. 
3701.15,- To counter it. 
3702.308,- If it's not enough and if you're sucking 
3705.54,you're going the other way. 
3706.5,"In reality, I think as long as you open the passageway, "
3709.13,I think the pressure differential 
3710.444,is going to solve your problem. 
3712.27,So I think you could actually blow in 
3714.27,when you're not supposed to. 
3715.99,"- Okay, so you could just hold your nose and blow air out, "
3720.23,or hold your nose and suck in the. 
3723.37,- Right. - Effect either way is fine? 
3725.05,- I think so. 
3725.98,"- Excellent, I just won $"
100,from Harvey Karten. 
3728.154,[laughs] 
3729.15,"- Thank you very much, this is a lot. "
3730.54,Harvey and I used to teach neuroanatomy together 
3732.47,"and I was like I don't think it matters, "
3734.22,"but thank you very much, I'll split that with you. "
3736.707,- Okay. 
3737.54,[laughs] 
3738.532,- This is important stuff. 
3741.116,But it's true you hear this. 
3743.092,So it doesn't matter either way. 
3744.77,- I'm no expert in this area. 
3746.93,- Don't worry. - Don't quote me. 
3747.92,"- He's not going to, well, I'm going to quote you. "
3750.231,"But, okay, so we've talked about the inner ear, "
3752.22,we've talked about the cerebellum. 
3754.0,I want to talk about an area of the brain 
3755.77,that is rarely discussed which is the midbrain. 
3759.38,- Yeah. 
3760.213,"- And for those that don't know, "
3762.86,the midbrain is an area beneath the cortex. 
3765.322,I guess we never really defined cortex 
3766.65,was kind of the outer layers or are the outer layers 
3770.69,of the at least mammalian brain or human brain. 
3774.207,"But the midbrain is super interesting, "
3776.796,"because it controls a lot of unconscious stuff, "
3782.46,"reflexes, et cetera. "
3784.78,And then there's this phenomenon even called blind sight. 
3787.93,So could you please tell us about the midbrain 
3791.02,"about what it does, and what in the world is sight? "
3795.7,"- Yeah, so there's a lot of pieces there. "
3799.55,"I think the first thing to say is, "
3800.96,"if you imagine the nervous system in your mind's eye, "
3804.999,you see this big honking brain 
3806.759,and then there's this little wand 
3810.87,that dangles down into your vertical column the spinal cord 
3814.57,and that's kind of your visual impression. 
3817.81,What you have to imagine is starting in the spinal cord 
3820.14,and working your way up into this big magnificent brain 
3822.567,"and what you would do as you enter the skull, "
3826.44,is get into a little place where the spinal cord 
3828.97,kind of thickens out. 
3830.18,"It still has that sort of long, skinny trunk-like feeling. "
3834.55,- It's more like a paddle or a spoon shape. 
3836.72,"- Right, it starts to spread out a little bit "
3838.257,and that's 'cause your evolutionists 
3840.23,packed more interesting goodies in there 
3842.08,for processing information and generating movement. 
3845.33,So beyond that is this tween brain we were talking about. 
3850.557,This linker brain with diencephalon really means 
3853.443,the between brain. 
3854.85,"- Oh, I thought you said tween. "
3856.08,"- Well, it is, yes. - No, no, no, between. "
3857.78,Between. - Between. 
3858.613,[indistinct] - You said tween. 
3859.78,"- Yeah, it's the between, it's the between brain "
3862.25,is what the name means. 
3864.32,It's the linker from the spinal cord in the periphery 
3867.78,up to these grand centers of the cortex. 
3870.107,But this midbrain you're talking about is the last bit 
3874.267,"of this enlarged sort of spinal cordy thing in your skull, "
3877.97,which is really the brain stem is what we call it. 
3880.646,The last bit of that before you get to this relay up 
3884.04,to the cortex is the midbrain. 
3886.99,"And there's a really important visual center there, "
3889.268,it's called the superior colliculus. 
3892.35,There's a similar center in the brains 
3894.56,"of other vertebrate animals a frog for example or a lizard, "
3898.46,would have this is called the optic tectum there 
3901.41,"but it's a center, then in these non-mammalian vertebrates, "
3908.44,is really the main visual center. 
3911.05,They don't really have what we would call a visual cortex 
3913.32,although there's something sort of like that. 
3915.68,But this is where most of the action is 
3917.57,in terms of interpreting visual input 
3919.57,and organizing behavior around that. 
3923.95,You can sort of think about this region 
3926.44,of the brain stem as a reflex center 
3928.55,that can reorient the animal's gaze or body 
3934.47,or maybe even attention to particular regions of space 
3939.41,out there around the animal 
3941.59,and that could be for all kinds of reasons. 
3943.493,It might be a predator just showed up in one corner 
3946.303,of the forest and you pick that up 
3948.177,and you're trying to avoid it. 
3949.683,"- Or just any movement. - Any movement, right? "
3952.4,It might be that suddenly something splats on the page 
3957.31,when you're reading a novel 
3958.184,and your eye reflexively looks at it. 
3961.904,"You don't have to think about that, that's a reflex. "
3964.2,- What if you throw me a ball but I'm not expecting it? 
3967.3,- Right. - And I just reach up 
3968.18,try and grab it touch it or not. 
3970.8,Is that handled by the midbrain? 
3972.32,"- Well, that's probably not the midbrain "
3974.94,"although by itself, because it's going to involve "
3978.3,"all these limb movements, "
3979.71,this movement of your arm and body. 
3983.01,- What about ducking 
3983.89,if something's suddenly thrown in your head? 
3985.67,"- Sure, right, things like that "
3987.1,"will certainly have a brainstem component, "
3988.99,"a midbrain component, something looms and you duck. "
3994.01,It may not be the superior colliculus 
3996.15,"we're talking about now, "
3997.01,it might be another part of the visual midbrain. 
3999.15,But these are centers that emerged early 
4001.69,in the evolution of brains like ours 
4003.92,to handle complicated visual events 
4006.291,that have significance for the animal 
4008.9,"in terms of space, where is it in space? "
4011.63,"And in fact, this same center "
4013.02,actually gets input from all kinds of other sensory systems 
4016.21,that take information from the external world 
4018.88,from particular locations 
4020.59,and where you might want to either avoid or approach things 
4023.54,according to their significance to you. 
4025.338,"So you get input from the touch system, "
4028.7,you get input from the auditory system. 
4031.53,"I work for a while in rattlesnakes, "
4033.49,they get input from a part of their warm sensors 
4037.315,"on their face, they're in these little pits on the face. "
4040.058,"- To work on baby rattlesnakes, right? "
4042.104,- They were adults. 
4043.589,"- Oh, I wasn't trying to diminish the danger. "
4045.67,I thought for some reason they were little ones. 
4047.29,- No. - Why in the world 
4048.507,would you work on rattlesnakes? 
4050.28,"- Well, because they have a version "
4053.77,of an extra receptive sensory system 
4055.94,that is they're looking out into the world 
4059.02,using a completely different set of sensors. 
4061.1,They're using the same sensors 
4062.31,that would feel the warmth on your face 
4063.99,if you stood in front of a bonfire. 
4065.569,"Except, evolution has given them "
4068.41,this very nice specialized system 
4069.97,that lets them image where the heat's coming from. 
4072.21,"You can sort of do that anyway, right? "
4073.92,"If you walk around the fire, "
4076.26,you can feel where the fire is from the heat 
4079.59,hitting your face. 
4080.57,- Is that the primary way in which they detect prey? 
4084.38,- It's one of one of the major ways. 
4086.71,"And in fact, they use vision as well "
4089.14,and they bring these two systems together 
4091.14,in the same place in this tectum regions 
4093.81,"brain stem, midbrain. "
4094.856,- What's the tongue jutting about when the snakes? 
4097.56,- That I don't know. 
4099.13,"That may be old factory, they're maybe. "
4100.77,- They're sniffing the air with their tongue? 
4101.954,"- Yeah, there may be, 'cause. "
4103.58,- On our drive you told me that flies actually taste things 
4107.08,"with their feet. - They do, yeah. "
4108.59,- That's so weird. 
4109.423,"- Yeah, they have taste receptors and lots of funny places. "
4113.32,I want to pause here just for one second 
4114.96,before we get back into the midbrain. 
4116.54,I think what's so interesting in all seriousness 
4120.16,"about taste receptors on feet, heat sensors, "
4125.08,tongues shutting out of snakes and vision 
4128.5,"and all this integration is that, "
4130.76,it really speaks to the fact that all these sensory neurons 
4135.06,are trying to gather information and stuff it into a system 
4139.75,that can make meaningful decisions and actions. 
4143.28,And that it really doesn't matter whether or not 
4145.14,"it's coming from eyes or ears or nose or bottoms of feet, "
4148.55,"because in the end, it's just electricity flowing in. "
4151.5,"And so it sounds like it's placed on each animal, "
4154.92,it always feels weird to call fly an animal. 
4157.36,"But they are creatures, they are animals. "
4161.41,It's placed in different locations on different animals 
4163.78,depending on the particular needs of that animal. 
4166.527,"- Right, but how much more powerful "
4169.16,if the nervous systems can also cross-correlate 
4172.87,across sensory systems? 
4174.95,"So if you've got a weak signal from one sensory system, "
4178.14,you're not quite sure there's something there. 
4179.98,And a weak signal from an another sensory system 
4183.02,that's telling you the same locations 
4184.8,is a little bit interesting. 
4186.36,There might be something there 
4187.78,if you've got those two together you've got corroboration. 
4190.53,Your brain now says it's much more likely 
4193.14,that that's going to be something worth paying attention to. 
4196.89,"- Right, so maybe I'm feeling some heat "
4199.6,on one side of my face 
4202.28,and I also smell something baking in the oven. 
4205.56,"- Right. - So now there's, "
4206.69,"it's neither is particularly strong, but as you said, "
4208.85,there's some corroboration. 
4210.06,- Right. And that corroboration 
4211.34,is occurring in the midbrain. 
4212.51,"- Right, and then if you throw things into conflict, "
4215.99,now the brain is confused 
4217.35,and that may be where your emotion sickness comes from. 
4220.05,"So it is great to have, as a brain, "
4223.03,it's great to have as many sources of information 
4224.79,"as you can have, just like if you're a spy "
4228.57,"or a journalist, you don't want as much information "
4230.62,"as you can get about what's out there, "
4233.07,"but if things conflict, that's problematic, right? "
4235.67,Your sources are giving you different information 
4237.39,about what's going on. 
4238.51,"Now you've got a problem on your hands, what do you publish? "
4241.518,- The midbrain is so fascinating. 
4243.56,I don't want to eject us from the midbrain 
4246.02,"and go back to the vestibular system, "
4247.87,but I do have a question that I forgot to ask 
4249.68,"about the vestibular system which is, "
4251.55,"why is it that for many people including me, "
4253.882,"despite my motion sickness in cabs, "
4256.46,that there's a sense of pleasure 
4259.25,in moving through space and getting tilted relative 
4262.3,to the gravitational pull of the earth? 
4264.21,"For me growing up it was skateboarding, "
4265.72,"but people like to corner in cars, corner on bikes, "
4270.2,maybe for some people it's done running or dance. 
4273.37,But what is it about moving through space 
4276.35,and getting tilted a lot of surfers around here. 
4279.72,Getting tilted that can tap 
4283.27,into some of the pleasure centers. 
4285.36,Do we have any idea why that would feel like? 
4286.93,- I have no clue. 
4288.61,- Is there dopaminergic input to this system? 
4291.5,"- Well, the dopaminergic system gets a lot of places. "
4297.19,It's pretty much to some extent everywhere in the cortex 
4301.38,"a lot more in the frontal lobe of course, "
4303.55,but that's just for starters. 
4306.17,There's basically dopaminergic innervation most places 
4308.69,in the central nervous system. 
4310.31,So there's the potential for dopamine urging involvement 
4312.72,but I really have no clue about the tilting phenomenon. 
4315.27,- People pay money to go on roller coasters. 
4318.04,"- Right, well, I think that may be as much about the thrill "
4320.69,as anything. - Sure. 
4321.54,And the falling reflex is very robust in all of us 
4324.833,when the visual world's going up very fast 
4327.19,it usually means that we're falling. 
4328.46,"- Right. - But some people like that, "
4329.98,some people don't. - Right. 
4331.33,And kids tolerate a lot more sort of vestibular craziness 
4336.07,spinning around until they've dropped. 
4338.47,"- And I've friends, it always you worries me a little bit "
4341.809,that they throw their kids. 
4343.61,I'm not recommending anyone do this. 
4345.0,When they're little like throwing the kids 
4347.02,"really far back and forth, some kids seem to love it. "
4350.034,"- Yeah, yeah, our son loved being shaken up and down "
4353.91,"very vigorously, that's the only thing "
4357.87,that would calm him down sometimes. 
4359.29,"- Interesting, yeah, so I'm guessing "
4361.035,we can guess that maybe there's some activation 
4366.37,of the reward systems from. - Yeah. 
4368.32,- Being moving through space. 
4370.21,"- Well, if you think about how rewarding it is "
4372.74,to be able to move through space 
4374.484,and how unhappy people are who are used to that 
4377.94,"who suddenly aren't able to do that, "
4379.69,"there is a sense of agency, right? "
4381.76,"If you can choose to move through the world and to tilt, "
4385.25,"that's not only you're moving through the world, "
4386.81,"but you're doing it with a certain amount of finesse, "
4388.45,maybe that's what it is. 
4389.34,You can feel like you're the master of your own movement 
4393.29,in a way that you wouldn't if you're going straight. 
4395.119,"I'm just blowing smoke here, right? "
4397.17,"- Yeah, well, we can speculate, that's fine. "
4398.93,I couldn't help but ask the question. 
4401.44,"Okay, so if we move ourselves pun intended "
4405.04,"back into the midbrain, "
4407.26,the midbrain is combining all these different signals 
4409.13,for reflexive action. 
4411.17,At what point does this become deliberate action? 
4414.92,"Because if I look at something I want and I want to pursue it, "
4417.61,I'm going to go toward it 
4419.18,and many times that's a deliberate decision. 
4422.36,"- Right, so this gets very slippery I think, "
4426.69,because what you have to try to imagine 
4429.3,is all these different parts of the brain 
4431.03,working on the problem of staying alive 
4436.22,"and surviving in the world, "
4439.02,"they're working on the problem simultaneously, "
4441.12,and there's not one right answer how to do that. 
4446.28,"But one way to think about it is that, "
4449.87,you have high levels of your nervous system 
4451.76,that are very well designed to override 
4456.1,an otherwise automatic movement if it's inappropriate. 
4459.58,So if you imagine you've been invited to tea with the queen 
4463.73,and she hands you very fancy Wedgewood teacup very thin. 
4469.74,- Wedgewood teacup? 
4470.84,"- Yes, with very hot tea in it and you're burning your hand, "
4474.1,you probably will try to find a way to put that back down 
4476.96,on the saucer rather than just dropping it on the floor 
4480.13,because you're with the queen. 
4482.77,You're trying to be appropriate to that. 
4485.52,So you have ways of reining in automatic behaviors 
4489.4,if they're going to be maladaptive. 
4492.13,But you also want the reflex to work quickly 
4494.58,if it's the only thing that's going to save you. 
4496.06,"The looming object coming at your head, "
4498.36,you don't have time to think about that. 
4500.3,So this is the interplay 
4503.07,in these hierarchically organized centers 
4505.26,of the nervous system at the lowest level. 
4507.69,You've got the automatic sensors and centers 
4510.23,and reflex arcs that will keep you safe 
4514.5,"even if you don't have time to think about it, "
4516.56,"and then you've got the higher center saying, "
4518.74,"well, maybe we could do this as well "
4520.64,"or maybe we shouldn't do that at all, right? "
4523.51,So you have all these different levels 
4525.7,operating simultaneously 
4527.55,and you need bi-directional communication 
4530.63,"between high-level, cognitive centers, "
4534.61,"decision-making on the one hand, "
4537.427,"and these low-level very helpful reflexive centers, "
4540.3,"but they're a little bit rigid, a little hard-wired "
4543.099,so they need some nuance. 
4544.55,So they're both of these things are operating in tandem 
4547.4,"in real time, all the time in our brains "
4549.86,and sometimes we listen more to one than the other. 
4551.76,You've heard people in sports talking about messing up 
4555.5,at the play 'cause they over thought it. 
4557.55,Thinking too hard about it. 
4559.01,That's partly you've already trained your cerebellum 
4561.88,how to hit a fastball right down the middle. 
4564.98,"- Right, and if you start looking "
4566.415,"for something new or different, "
4568.8,you're going to mess up your reflexive swing. 
4571.13,"- Right, if you're trying to think "
4572.05,"about the physics of the ball as it's coming at you, "
4575.02,"you've already missed, right? "
4576.103,"Because you're not using your, all those reps "
4579.95,have built a kind of knowledge is what you want to rely on 
4583.69,when you don't have enough time to contemplate. 
4588.22,- This is important and a great segue 
4590.34,for what I'd like to discuss next 
4592.501,which is the basal ganglia. 
4595.92,This really interesting of the area of the brain 
4598.24,that's involved in go-type commands 
4602.72,and behaviors instructing us to do things 
4604.99,and no-go preventing us from doing things. 
4607.8,Because so much of motor learning and skill execution 
4610.75,and not saying the wrong thing 
4613.56,or sitting still in class 
4615.324,or as you use with the tea with the queen example 
4619.52,feeling discomfort involves suppressing behavior 
4623.93,and sometimes it's activating behavior. 
4625.338,- Right. 
4626.171,- A tremendous amount of online attention 
4627.44,is devoted to trying to get people motivated. 
4631.41,This isn't the main focus of our podcast. 
4633.35,We touch on some of the underlying neural circuits 
4634.892,of motivation dopamine and so forth. 
4637.45,But so much of what people struggle with out there 
4641.03,are elements around failure to pay attention. 
4646.03,- Right. 
4646.863,- Or challenges in paying attention 
4648.34,which is essentially like putting the blinders on 
4649.937,and they're getting a soda straw view of the world 
4652.69,and maintaining that for a about of work 
4654.72,or something of that sort and trying to get into action. 
4658.94,"So of course, this is carried out by many neural circuits "
4662.44,not just the basal ganglia. 
4663.62,"But what are the basal ganglia, "
4665.89,and what are their primary roles in controlling 
4669.1,go type behavior and no-go type behavior? 
4671.95,"- Yeah, so the basal ganglia are sitting deep "
4675.175,in what you would call the forebrains 
4677.7,or the highest levels of the brain. 
4680.56,They are sort of cousins to the cerebral cortex 
4685.5,which we talked about as sort of the highest level 
4687.49,"of your brain, the thing you're thinking with. "
4689.817,- The cerebral cortex being the refined cousins 
4691.552,and then you've got the. - Right. 
4692.777,"- The brute, yeah. - Yeah. "
4695.87,"That's probably totally unfair, but. "
4697.61,"- That's right, I like the basal ganglia. "
4699.62,I can relate to the brutish parts of the brain. 
4702.47,"A little bit of hypothalamus, "
4703.94,"a little bit of basal ganglia, sure. "
4705.64,"- We need it all, we need it all. "
4707.87,And this area of the brain has gotten a lot bigger 
4713.8,as the cortex has gotten bigger 
4715.32,and it's deeply intertwined with cortical function. 
4719.35,The cortex can't really do what it needs to do 
4721.251,without the help of the basal ganglia and vice versa. 
4723.73,So they're really intertwined. 
4728.8,"And in a way you can think about this logically is saying, "
4732.37,if you have the ability to withhold behavior 
4735.087,"or to execute it, how do you decide which to do? "
4738.89,"Well, the cortex is going to have to do that thinking for you. "
4741.72,You have to be looking at all the contingencies 
4744.33,"of your situation to decide is this a crazy move, "
4747.68,or is this a really smart investment right now or what? 
4751.35,"- I don't want to go out for a run in the morning, "
4753.127,"but I'm going to make myself go out for a run, "
4755.28,or I'm having a great time out on a run 
4757.84,and I know I need to get back 
4759.13,but I kind of want to go another mile. 
4760.74,"- I mean, another great example is that, "
4762.59,the marshmallow test for the little kids. 
4764.3,They can get two marshmallows if they hold off 
4768.45,just 
30,"seconds initially, they can have one right away. "
4772.55,But if they can wait 
30,"seconds, they got two. "
4774.29,"So that's the no go because their cortex is saying, "
4777.4,I would really like to have two more than having one. 
4781.02,But they're not going to get the two 
4782.49,unless they can not reach for the one. 
4785.71,So they've got to hold off the action 
4789.64,and that has to result from a cognitive process. 
4793.38,So the cortex is involved in this in a major way. 
4797.614,"- Yeah, as I recall in that experiment, "
4799.02,the kids used a variety of tools. 
4801.03,Some would distract themselves. 
4802.73,I particularly related to the kid 
4804.41,that would just put himself right next to the marshmallows 
4807.02,"and then some of the kids covered their eyes, "
4810.0,some of them would count or sing. 
4811.86,"Yeah, so that's all very cortical, right? "
4813.32,"Coming up with a novel strategy, "
4815.1,simple example that we're using here. 
4816.59,"But of course, this is at play anytime someone decides "
4819.55,they want to go watch a motivational speech 
4821.48,or something just a Steve Jobs commencement speech 
4824.28,just to get motivated to engage in their day. 
4826.077,- Should I take this new job? 
4828.306,"It's got great benefits, "
4830.05,but it's in a lousy part of the country. 
4832.11,- Why do you think that some people have a harder time 
4836.13,running these go no-go circuits 
4838.17,and other people seem to have very low activation energy 
4842.23,"we would say, they could just, they have a task, "
4844.78,they just lean into the task. - Right. 
4846.09,- Whereas some people getting into task completion 
4849.08,or things of that sort is very challenging for them? 
4852.48,"- Yeah, I think it's really just another, "
4854.96,it's a special case of a very general phenomenon 
4857.34,which is brains are complicated. 
4860.35,And the brains we have are the result of genetics 
4865.48,"and experience, and my genes are different from your genes "
4868.87,and my experiences are different from your experiences. 
4871.04,So the things that would be easy or hard for us 
4873.63,"won't necessarily be aligned, they might just happen to be "
4877.17,"just because they are, but the point is that, "
4880.387,"you're dealt a certain set of cards, "
4883.98,"you have certain set of genes, you are handed a brain, "
4887.66,you don't choose your brain it's handed to you. 
4890.71,Then there's all this stuff you can do with it. 
4892.33,You can learn to have new skills or to act differently 
4899.92,or to show more restraint which is kind of relevant 
4902.36,to what we're talking about here. 
4903.84,Or maybe show less restraint 
4905.83,"if your problem is you're so buttoned down, "
4908.09,you never have any fun in life 
4909.26,and you should loosen up a little bit. 
4910.99,"- Thank you, I appreciate that. "
4912.172,- Yeah. - Yeah. 
4913.296,[laughs] 
4915.36,David's always encouraging me 
4916.48,to have a little more fun in life. 
4917.907,[laughs] 
4919.94,So basil ganglia they're kind of the disciplinarian 
4924.12,"or they're sort of the instructor conductor of sorts, right? "
4927.99,"Go, no-go, you be quiet, you start now. "
4931.45,- I wish I knew more about the basal ganglia than I do. 
4934.95,"My sense is that, this system is key "
4939.37,"for implementing the plans that get cooked up in the cortex, "
4944.96,but they also influence the plans 
4947.69,that the cortex is dishing out 
4950.59,because this is a major source of information to the cortex. 
4954.57,So it becomes almost impossible to figure out 
4957.93,where the computation begins and where it ends 
4960.67,and who's doing what 
4961.82,because these things are all interacting 
4964.24,"in a complex network, and it's all of it. "
4966.68,"It's the whole network, it's not one is the leader "
4969.42,and the other is the follower. 
4970.55,"- Right, of course, yeah, these are all the structures "
4972.53,that we're discussing are working in parallel. 
4975.45,- Right. 
4976.283,- And there's a lot of changing crosstalk. 
4979.18,I have this somewhat sick habit David. 
4983.3,Every day I try and do 
21,no-gos. 
4986.23,"So if I want to reach for my phone, "
4988.19,I try and not do it just to see if I can prevent myself 
4992.12,"from engaging in that behavior, if it was reflexive, "
4995.55,"if it's something I want to do a deliberate choice, "
4998.55,then I certainly allow myself to do it. 
5000.36,- Right. 
5001.193,- I don't tend to have too much trouble with motivation 
5002.026,"with go type functions, mostly because I'm so busy "
5005.92,that I'd wish I had more time for more goes so to speak. 
5011.14,But do you think these circuits 
5013.18,have genuine plasticity in them? 
5015.24,"- Absolutely, everybody knows how they've learned "
5018.27,"over time to wait for the two marshmallows, right? "
5022.21,You don't have to have instant gratification all the time. 
5024.9,You're willing to do a job 
5027.29,sometimes it isn't your favorite job 
5029.51,because it comes with the territory 
5030.88,and you want the salary that comes at the end of the week 
5032.85,"or the end of the month, right? "
5034.23,So we can defer gratification. 
5037.48,We can choose not to say the thing 
5039.94,that we know is going to inflame our partner 
5041.96,and create a meltdown for the next week. 
5046.43,"We learn this control, "
5047.97,but I think these are skills like any other 
5051.41,you can get better at them if you practice them. 
5053.11,"So I think you're choosing to do that to spontaneously, "
5055.605,"is kind of a mental practice, it's a discipline, "
5058.82,it's a way of building a skill that you want to have. 
5061.78,"- Yeah, I find it to be something "
5063.219,"that when I engage in a no-go type situation, "
5069.89,then the next time and the next time 
5072.08,"that I find myself about to move reflexively, "
5074.37,there's a little gap in consciousness 
5076.36,that I can make a decision whether or not 
5078.71,this is really the best use of my time. 
5080.86,Because sometimes I wonder whether or not all this business 
5083.87,around attention certainly there's the case of ADHD 
5087.0,and clinical diagnosed ADHD. 
5088.73,But all the issue around focus and attention 
5091.24,is really that people just have not really learned 
5093.49,how to short circuit a reflex. 
5096.3,"And so much of what makes us different than rattlesnakes, "
5099.18,"or well, actually they could be deliberate, "
5101.16,but from the other animals 
5103.3,and is our ability to suppress reflex. 
5106.022,"- Yeah, well, that's the cortex. "
5108.3,Or let's say the forebrain. 
5109.775,Cortex and basal ganglia are working together 
5112.62,sitting on top of this lizard brain 
5115.63,that's giving you all these great adaptive reflexes 
5117.96,that help you survive. 
5119.47,You just hope you don't get the surprising case 
5122.43,where the thing that your reflex is telling you 
5124.69,is actually exactly the wrong thing 
5126.21,"and you make a mistake, right? "
5127.616,[indistinct] 
5128.449,"Right, so that's what the cortex is for. "
5129.9,"It's adding nuance and context and experience, "
5133.78,"past association and in human beings obviously, "
5137.37,learning from others through communication. 
5141.36,"- Well, I was, you went right to it "
5144.51,and it was where I was going to go. 
5145.71,So let's talk about the cortex. 
5147.09,We've worked our way up the so-called neuraxis 
5149.71,"as the aficionados will know, so we're in the cortex. "
5154.11,"This is the seat of our higher consciousness, "
5155.87,"self-image, planning and action. "
5158.23,"But as you mentioned, the cortex isn't just about that, "
5160.5,it's got other regions that are involved in other things. 
5162.96,"So maybe we should staying with vision, "
5165.6,let's talk a little bit about visual cortex. 
5167.87,You told me an amazing story about visual cortex 
5171.79,and it was somewhat of a sad story 
5173.3,unfortunately about someone who had a stroke 
5175.86,to visual cortex. 
5177.93,Maybe if you would share that story 
5180.29,because I think it illustrates many important principles 
5183.24,about what the cortex does. 
5185.08,"- Right, so the visual cortex "
5189.938,you could say the projection screen. 
5191.61,The first place where this information streaming 
5195.76,from the retina through this thalamus connecting linker 
5201.78,gets played out for the highest level of your brain to see. 
5207.84,"It's a representation, "
5208.81,it's a map of things going on in the visual world 
5212.58,that's in your brain. 
5215.16,"And when we describe a scene to a friend, "
5221.06,we're using this chunk of our brain to be able to put words 
5224.49,which are coming from a different part of our cortex 
5227.26,to the objects and movements and colors that we see 
5230.75,in the world. 
5233.26,So that's a key part of your visual experience 
5237.383,"when you can describe the things you're seeing, "
5240.46,"you're looking at your visual cortex, and this is. "
5243.65,- Could I just ask a quick question? 
5244.64,So right now because I'm looking at your face. 
5247.07,"- Right. - As we're talking, "
5249.03,there are neurons in my brain 
5251.04,more or less in the configuration of your face 
5254.73,that are active as you move about. 
5257.83,"And what if I were to close my eyes and just imagine, "
5263.54,I do this all the time by the way David. 
5264.96,I close my eyes and i imagine David Berson's face. 
5268.111,[laughs] 
5268.944,"I don't tend to do that as often, maybe I should. "
5271.12,"But you get the point, I'm now using visualization "
5274.57,of what you look like by way of memory. 
5276.93,- Right. - If we were to image 
5278.15,"the neurons in my brain, would the activity of neurons "
5282.46,resemble the activity of neurons that's present 
5287.49,when I open my eyes and look at your actual face? 
5289.72,"- This is a deep question, we don't really have a full. "
5292.89,- It seems like. 
5293.723,[indistinct] 
5295.0,"- Yes, except you're talking about looking in detail "
5298.8,at the activity of neurons in a human brain 
5302.11,and that's not as easy to do 
5304.042,as it would be in some kind of animal model. 
5307.13,"But the bottom line is that, "
5309.05,you have a spatial representation of the visual world 
5314.27,late as a map of the visual world 
5316.404,lay down on the surface of your cortex. 
5318.92,"The thing that's surprising is that, "
5321.5,"it's not one map, it's actually dozens of maps. "
5324.88,- What do each of those maps do? 
5326.4,"- Well, we don't really have a full accounting there either, "
5328.76,but it looks a little bit like the diversification 
5332.25,"of the output neurons of the retina, "
5335.01,the ganglion cells we were talking about before. 
5336.95,There are different types of ganglion cells 
5338.79,that are encoding different kinds of information 
5340.95,"about the visual world, "
5341.96,we talk about the ones that were encoding the brightness. 
5345.07,but other ones are encoding motion or color 
5347.74,"these kinds of things, the same kinds of specializations "
5350.6,in different representations of the visual world 
5353.0,in the cortex seem to be true. 
5356.02,"It's a complex story, we don't have the whole picture yet, "
5359.91,but it does look as if some parts of the brain 
5361.78,are much more important 
5362.613,for things like reaching for things in the space around you. 
5368.17,And other parts of the cortex are really important 
5370.07,for making associations between particular visual things 
5372.82,you're looking at now and their significance. 
5375.86,"What is that object, what can it do for me, "
5378.44,how can I use it? 
5379.65,- What about the really specialized areas of cortex 
5382.4,"like neurons that respond to particular faces, "
5386.5,or neurons that I don't know can help me understand 
5391.63,where I am relative to some other specific object? 
5394.72,"- Right, so these are our properties of neurons "
5399.01,that are extracted from detected by recording the activity 
5406.66,of single neurons in some experimental system. 
5409.55,What's going on when you actually 
5411.51,"perceive your grandmother's face, "
5413.78,is a much more complicated question 
5415.57,and it clearly involves hundreds and thousands 
5417.56,and probably millions of neurons 
5419.329,acting in a cooperative way. 
5421.49,So you can pick out any one little element 
5423.91,in this very complicated system 
5426.06,and see that it's responding differentially 
5428.17,to certain kinds of visual patterns 
5429.95,and you think you're seeing a glimpse 
5431.61,of some part of the process 
5433.05,by which you recognize your grandmother's face. 
5436.14,But that's a long way from a complete description 
5438.94,and it certainly isn't going to be at the level 
5440.95,of a magic single neuron that has the special stuff 
5444.16,"to recognize your grandmother, it's going to be in some pattern "
5446.46,"of activity across many, many cells "
5450.27,resonating in some kind of special way 
5452.89,that will represent the internal memory of your mother. 
5457.57,- So it's really incredible? - Yeah. 
5459.373,- I mean that every time we do this deep dive 
5461.62,"which we do from time to time, "
5462.84,you and I we kind of like march into the nervous system 
5465.26,and explore how different aspects of our life experiences 
5470.193,is handled there and how it's organized. 
5475.855,"After so many decades of doing this, "
5477.65,it still boggles my mind that the collection of neurons 
5482.76,one through seven active in a particular sequence 
5486.43,gives the memory of a particular face 
5488.68,"and run backwards seven through to one, "
5492.27,"it gives you a, it could be rattlesnake "
5496.27,pit viper heat sensing organs. - Right. 
5498.477,- You were talking about earlier. 
5500.98,"So it sounds, "
5501.9,is it true that there's a lot of multi-purposing 
5504.82,"of the circuitry, like we can't say "
5506.79,one area of the brain does A 
5509.32,and another area of the brain does B. 
5510.99,So areas can multitask or have multiple jobs. 
5515.59,They can moonlight. 
5516.51,"- Right, but I think in my career, "
5521.15,the hard problem has been to square that 
5526.19,with the fact that things are specialized 
5530.94,that there are specific genes expressed 
5533.233,in specific neurons that make them make synaptic connections 
5537.21,with only certain other neurons. 
5539.29,And that particular synaptic arrangement 
5541.92,actually results in the processing of information 
5544.91,"that's useful to the animal to survive, right? "
5548.45,So it's not as if it's either a big undifferentiated network 
5553.72,of cells and looking at any one 
5555.89,is never going to tell you anything 
5557.1,"that's too extreme on the one hand, "
5559.29,nor is it the case that everything is hardwired 
5561.07,and every neuron has one function 
5562.66,"and this all happens in one place in the brain, "
5565.81,it's way more complicated and interactive 
5568.0,and interconnected than that. 
5569.6,- So we're not hardwired or soft-wired? 
5571.85,"- Both. - We're sort of, "
5573.533,I don't know what the analogy should be what substance 
5575.97,would work best David? 
5577.13,"- No idea there, but the idea is that, "
5581.3,it's always network activity. 
5583.42,"There's always many, many neurons involved "
5586.09,and yet there's tremendous specificity in the neurons 
5589.28,that might or might not be participating 
5590.98,"in any distributed function like that, right? "
5593.9,So you have to get your mind 
5594.93,around the fact that it's both very specific 
5597.33,and very non-specific at the same time. 
5599.4,"It's a little tricky to do, "
5600.63,but I think that's kind of where the truth lies. 
5603.1,"- Yeah, and so this example "
5605.58,that you mentioned to me once before about a woman 
5609.09,"who had a stroke in visual cortex, "
5610.69,I think it speaks to some of this. 
5612.13,- Right. 
5613.4,- Could you share with us that story? 
5614.82,"- Sure, so the point is that, all those of us who see "
5620.322,have representations of the visual world 
5623.07,in our visual cortex. 
5624.72,What happens to somebody when they become blind 
5629.78,"because of problems in the eye, the retina perhaps? "
5634.52,"You have a big chunk of the cortex, "
5636.48,this really valuable [indistinct] for neural processing 
5641.06,that has come to expect input from the visual system 
5645.07,and there isn't any anymore. 
5646.229,"So you might think about that as fallow land, right? "
5648.99,It's just used by the nervous system 
5652.917,"and that would be a pity, "
5653.97,but it turns out that it is in fact used. 
5658.58,And the the case that you're talking about is of a woman 
5661.77,who was blind from very early in her life 
5668.12,and who had risen through the ranks 
5670.45,to a very high level executive secretarial position 
5673.75,in a major corporation. 
5676.3,And she was extremely good at braille reading 
5678.63,and she had a braille typewriter 
5679.79,and that's how everything was done. 
5681.98,"And apparently, she had a stroke and was discovered at work, "
5686.1,collapsed and brought her to the hospital. 
5688.45,"And apparently, the neurologist who saw her "
5692.0,"when she finally came to said, "
5694.107,"""I've got good news and bad news."" "
5696.21,"Bad news is you've had a stroke, "
5697.95,the good news is that it was in an area of your brain 
5700.26,you're not even using it's your visual cortex 
5703.07,and I know you're blind from birth 
5704.59,"so there shouldn't be any issue here."" "
5706.55,"The problem was, she lost her ability to read braille. "
5711.18,So what appears to have been the case 
5713.49,and this has been confirmed in other ways 
5716.39,"by imaging experiments in humans is that, "
5719.15,"in people who are blind from very early in birth, "
5722.02,the visual cortex gets repurposed 
5725.28,as a center for processing tactile information. 
5728.77,"And especially if you train to be a good braille reader, "
5731.56,you're actually reallocating somehow that real estate 
5735.73,to your fingertips. 
5737.131,A part of the cortex that should be listening to the eyes. 
5740.26,So that's an extreme level of plasticity. 
5742.45,"But what it shows, is the visual cortex "
5745.76,"is kind of a general purpose processing machine, "
5748.77,it's good at spatial information 
5751.527,and the skin of your fingers is just another spatial sense 
5755.07,and deprived of any other input the brain seems smart enough 
5759.63,if you want to put it that way to rewire itself 
5762.55,"to use that real estate for something useful, "
5765.66,"in this case, reading braille. "
5768.08,"- Incredible, somewhat tragic, but incredible. "
5770.38,"At least in that case tragic, yeah. "
5772.3,- Very informative. - Very informative. 
5774.11,And of course it can go the other way too. 
5775.64,- Right. 
5776.473,- Where people can gain function in particular modalities 
5780.22,like improved hearing or tactile function 
5782.69,in the absence of vision. - Right. 
5786.95,"- Tell us about connectomes, we hear about genomes, "
5790.47,"proteomes, microbiomes, ohms, ohms, ohms "
5794.324,these days. - Yeah. 
5796.94,- What's a connectome and why is it valuable? 
5799.4,"- Yeah, so the connectome actually now has two meanings. "
5802.76,So I'll only refer to one that is my passion right now. 
5807.422,And that is really trying to understand the structure 
5810.14,"of nervous tissue at a scale that's very, very fine. "
5818.13,- Smaller than a millimeter. 
5819.2,"- Way smaller than a millimeter, a nanometer or less, "
5822.68,as that's 
"1,",
000,"times smaller, "
5825.966,or it's actually a million times smaller. 
5832.0,"So really, really tiny "
5834.1,on the scale of individual synapses 
5836.09,between individual neurons 
5837.3,or even smaller like the individual synaptic vesicles 
5840.44,containing little packets of neurotransmitter 
5842.26,they're going to get it released to allow one neuron 
5844.71,to communicate to the next. 
5846.37,"So very, very fine, but the notion here is that, "
5853.13,you're doing this section after section at very fine scale. 
5859.27,So in theory what you have is a complete description 
5861.86,of a chunk of nervous tissue that is so complete 
5866.28,that if you took enough time to identify 
5868.06,"where the boundaries of all the cells are, "
5869.86,you could come up with a complete description 
5872.36,of the synaptic wiring of that chunk of nervous tissue 
5875.78,because you have a complete description 
5876.82,of where all the cells are and where all the synapses 
5878.99,between where all the cells are. 
5880.4,So now you essentially have a wiring diagram 
5882.71,of this complicated piece of tissue. 
5884.69,So the omics part is the exhaustiveness of it 
5888.56,rather than looking at a couple of synapses 
5890.29,that are interesting to you from two different cell types. 
5893.89,You're looking at all the synapses of all of the cell types 
5897.77,"which of course is this massive avalanche of data, right? "
5902.69,"- So in genetics, you have genetics "
5904.34,and then you have genomics 
5905.38,which is the idea of getting the whole genome. 
5907.05,- All of it. 
5907.883,"- And we don't really have an analogous word for genetics, "
5910.91,but it would be connectivity and [indistinct]. 
5913.091,- Right. [indistinct] 
5918.07,"- Right, so it's wanting it all "
5920.33,"and of course it's crazy ambitious, "
5922.68,but that's where it gets fun. 
5925.24,"Really it's a use of electron microscopy, "
5928.53,a very high resolution microscopic imaging system 
5933.48,on a new scale with way more payoff 
5936.9,in terms of understanding the connectivity 
5938.68,"of the nervous system and it's just emerging, "
5941.53,but I really think it's going to revolutionize the field 
5944.29,because we're going to be able to query these circuits 
5947.23,"how do they actually do it, look at the hardware "
5949.9,in a way that's never been possible before. 
5952.43,- The the way that I describe this to people 
5954.55,is if you were to take a chunk of kind of cooked 
5958.38,but cold spaghetti. - Right. 
5960.22,- And slice it up very thin you're trying to connect up 
5963.83,each image of each slice of the edge of the spaghetti 
5968.1,as figure out which ropes of spaghetti 
5970.07,belong to which. 
5970.903,- And have a complete description 
5972.23,of where this piece of spaghetti 
5973.46,touches that piece of spaghetti 
5974.466,is there's something special there obviously. 
5976.74,- Meat sauces and all the other cell types 
5978.69,and the pesto where it all is around the spaghetti 
5983.76,"because those are the other cells, the blood vessels "
5985.58,and the glial cells. 
5987.03,"And so, what's it good for? "
5990.7,"Maps are great, I always think of connectomics and genomics "
5995.364,"and proteomics, et cetera as necessary, "
5999.07,but not sufficient. - Right. 
6001.03,"Right, so I mean in many cases what you do is you go out "
6003.84,and probe the function 
6005.89,and you understand how the brain does the function 
6007.99,by finding neurons that seem to be firing 
6010.92,in association with this function that you're observing. 
6014.09,And little by little you're work your way in 
6015.7,and now you want to know what the conductivity is 
6017.3,maybe the anatomy could help you. 
6019.73,But this connectomics approach 
6021.55,or at least the serial electron microscopy 
6023.66,"reconstruction of neurons approach, "
6027.23,really is allowing us to frame questions 
6029.938,"starting from the anatomy and saying, "
6033.45,"I see a synaptic circuit here, "
6035.13,my prediction would be that these cell types would interact 
6038.01,"in a particular way, is that right? "
6040.16,And then you can go and probe the physiology 
6042.2,and you might be right or you might be wrong. 
6043.76,"But more often than not, it looks like the structure "
6046.83,is pointing us in the right direction. 
6048.78,"So in my case, I'm using this to try to understand a circuit "
6053.51,that is involved in this image stabilization network 
6056.15,"we're talking about, keeping things stable on the retina "
6060.25,and this thing will only respond 
6062.54,at certain speeds of motion. 
6064.307,These cells in the circuit 
6066.04,"like slow motion they won't respond to fast motion, "
6068.867,how does that come about? 
6070.33,"Well, I was able to probe the circuitry, "
6074.04,"I knew what my cells looked like, "
6075.5,"I could see which other cells were talking to it, "
6077.116,I could categorize all the cells 
6079.08,that might be the players here 
6080.58,that are involved in this mechanism of tuning the thing 
6083.54,"for slow speeds, "
6085.53,and then we said it looks like it's that cell type 
6087.87,and we went and looked and the data bore that up. 
6090.814,But the anatomy drove the search 
6093.34,for the particular cell type 
6094.51,because we could see it connected in the right place 
6096.89,to the right cells. 
6098.02,So creates the hypothesis 
6100.09,"that lets you go query the physiology, "
6102.62,but it can go the other way as well. 
6104.01,So it's always the synergy between these functional 
6106.12,and structural approaches it gives you the most lift. 
6111.29,"But in many cases, "
6113.68,the anatomy has been a little bit the weak sister in this. 
6116.65,The structure trying to work out the diagram 
6119.12,because we haven't had the methods. 
6120.9,Now the methods exist 
6122.68,"and this whole field is expanding very quickly, "
6125.74,because people want these circuit diagrams 
6127.815,for the particular part of the nervous system 
6130.91,that they're working on. 
6132.41,"If you don't know the cell types and the connections, "
6134.31,how do you really understand how the machine works? 
6137.42,"- Yeah, what I love about is, "
6138.85,we don't know what we don't know. 
6139.877,- Right. 
6140.71,"- And scientists we don't ask questions, we pose hypotheses. "
6143.89,Hypotheses being of course some prediction 
6146.26,that you wager your time on basically. 
6148.9,- Right. - And it either turns out 
6150.98,"to be true or not true, but if you don't know "
6155.93,"that a particular cell type is there, "
6157.61,you could never in any configuration of life or a career 
6163.96,or exploration of a nervous system wager a hypothesis 
6167.79,because you didn't know it was there. 
6169.34,"So this allows you to say ah, "
6170.46,there's a little interesting little connection 
6172.95,between this cell that I know is interesting 
6175.03,"in another cell that's a little mysterious but interesting, "
6177.64,"I'm going to hypothesize that it's doing blank, "
6180.08,blank and blank and go test that. 
6181.31,"And in the absence of these connectomes, "
6183.45,you would never know that that cell was lurking there 
6185.15,in the shadows. 
6186.623,"- Right, right, yeah. "
6188.3,And if you're just trying to understand 
6189.65,"how information flows through this biological machine, "
6193.884,you want to know where things are. 
6196.37,Neurotransmitters are dumped out of the terminals 
6198.64,of one cell and they diffuse across the space 
6201.89,between the two cells which is kind of a liquidy space 
6204.285,and they hit some receptors on the postsynaptic cell 
6206.71,and they have some impact. 
6208.92,"Sometimes that's not through a regular synapse, "
6211.41,sometimes it's through a neuromodulator 
6213.1,like you often talk about on your podcast 
6215.84,that are sort of. 
6216.673,"- Dopamine. - Dopamine, exactly. "
6218.22,Oozing into the space between the cells 
6220.53,and it may be acting at some distance 
6222.7,"far from where it was released, right? "
6225.03,But if you don't know where the release is happening 
6227.2,and where other things 
6228.14,are that might respond to that release 
6229.87,you're groping around in the dark. 
6232.162,"- Well, I love that you are doing this "
6234.11,"and I have to share with the listeners that, "
6238.42,the first time I ever met David 
6240.113,and every time I've ever met with him in-person 
6243.23,"at least at his laboratory at Brown, "
6246.24,"he was in his office, door closed, "
6248.75,drawing neurons and their connections. 
6250.937,[laughs] 
6251.77,And this is somewhat unusual 
6253.16,for somebody who's a endowed full professor or chairman 
6256.93,of the department et cetera for many years 
6259.24,to be doing the hands-on work. 
6260.91,"Typically, that's the stuff that's done by technicians "
6262.77,or graduate students or postdocs. 
6264.18,But I think it's fair to say 
6266.09,that you really love looking at nervous systems 
6269.76,and drawing the accurate renditions 
6273.18,of how those nervous systems are organized 
6275.59,and thinking about how they work. 
6277.33,"- Yeah, it's pure joy for me. "
6278.81,"I mean, I'm a very visual person, my wife is an artist, "
6281.225,we look a lot of art together 
6283.55,just the forms of things are gorgeous in their own right. 
6287.58,But to know that the form is in a sense the function 
6291.29,that the architecture of the connectivity 
6295.56,is how the computation happens in the brain at some level 
6299.47,"even though we don't fully understand that in most contexts, "
6302.85,gives me great joy 'cause I'm working on something 
6304.978,that's both visually beautiful but also deeply beautiful 
6309.499,"in a sort of a higher sort of knowledge context, "
6315.389,what is it all about. 
6316.75,"- I love it, well, as a final question, "
6320.04,I get asked very often about how people 
6322.52,"should learn about neuroscience, "
6325.36,or how they should go about pursuing maybe an education 
6328.16,in neuroscience if they're at that stage of their life 
6330.33,or that's appropriate for their current trajectory. 
6334.07,"Do you have any advice to young people, old people, "
6336.936,anything in between about how to learn 
6339.73,about the nervous system more maybe in a more formal way? 
6342.52,"I mean obviously, we have our podcast, "
6343.89,there are other sources of neuroscience information 
6346.81,"out there, but for the young person "
6348.61,"who thinks they want to understand the brain, "
6351.61,"they want to learn about the brain, what should we tell them? "
6355.12,"- Well, that's a great question. "
6356.37,And there's so many sources out there. 
6357.88,It's almost a question 
6358.95,of how do you deal with this avalanche of information 
6361.723,"out there, I think your podcast is a great way for people "
6364.635,to learn more about the nervous system in an accessible way. 
6368.25,But there's so much stuff out there 
6369.76,and it's not just that. 
6370.593,"I mean, the resources are becoming more and more available "
6373.87,for average folks to participate in neuroscience research 
6378.58,on some level. 
6379.413,There's this famous Eyewire project of Sebastian. 
6381.108,"- Oh yeah, maybe you let us about Eyewire. "
6383.26,"- Yeah, so that's connectomics and that's a situation "
6386.243,where a very clever scientist realized 
6389.21,that the physical work of doing all this reconstruction 
6393.82,"of neurons from these electron micro-graphs, "
6397.23,there's a lot of time involved. 
6399.92,"Many, many person hours have to go into that "
6402.4,to come up with the map that you want 
6404.76,"of where the cells are, and he was very clever "
6407.33,about setting up a context 
6409.24,in which he could crowdsource this 
6411.36,and people who were interested 
6412.193,in getting a little experience looking at nervous tissue 
6414.76,and participating in a research project 
6417.077,could learn how to do this and do a little bit. 
6419.413,- From their living room. - From their living room. 
6421.86,"- We'll put a link to Eyewire, it also is a great bridge "
6424.61,between what we were just talking about connectomics 
6426.42,and actually participating in research. 
6428.5,- Right. 
6429.333,- And you don't need a graduate mentor 
6430.65,or anything like that. - Right. 
6432.79,So more of this is coming 
6433.867,and I'm actually interested in building more of this 
6438.24,"so that people who are interested, "
6440.16,want to participate at some level 
6441.57,don't necessarily have the time or resources 
6444.52,to get involved in laboratory research 
6446.799,can get exposed to it and participate 
6449.9,"and actually contribute, so I think that's one thing. "
6454.335,"I mean, just asking questions of the people around you "
6457.897,who know a little bit more 
6459.4,and have them point you in the right direction. 
6461.22,"Here's a book you might like to read, "
6462.62,there's lots of great popular books out there 
6465.84,that are accessible that will give you some more sense 
6468.75,of the full range of what's out there in the neurosciences. 
6471.99,- We can put some links to a few of those that we like. 
6474.39,- Right. - On basic neuroscience. 
6476.12,- Right. - Our good friend 
6476.953,"Dick Masland, the late Richard, "
6479.57,people call him Dick Masland had a good book. 
6483.77,I forget the title at the moment. 
6485.118,It's sitting behind me somewhere over there on the shelf 
6488.681,about vision and how nervous systems work. 
6490.44,A pretty accessible book for the general public. 
6492.57,- Right - Yeah. 
6493.403,"- Right, so that, and there's so many sources out there. "
6496.58,"I mean, Wikipedia is a great way. "
6498.11,"If you have a particular question about visual function, "
6500.13,"I would say by all means, head to Wikipedians "
6502.431,and get the first look 
6505.55,"and follow the the references from there, "
6507.56,"or go to your library, or there's so many ways "
6511.33,"to get into it, it's such an exciting field now. "
6513.95,"There's so many, "
6514.783,"I mean, any particular realm that's special to you, "
6517.49,"your experience, your strengths, your passions, "
6522.03,there's a field of neuroscience devoted to that. 
6525.45,If you know somebody who's got a neurological problem 
6527.88,"or a psychiatric problem, there's a branch of neuroscience "
6531.87,that is devoted to trying to understand that 
6534.64,and to solve these kinds of problems down the line. 
6538.46,"So feel the buzz, it's an exciting time to get involved. "
6543.38,"- Great, those are great resources that people can access "
6545.67,from anywhere zero-cost as you need an internet connection. 
6548.78,"But aside from that, we'll put the links to some. "
6551.047,"And I'm remembering, Dick's book is called, "
6553.817,"""We Know It When We See It."" "
6555.28,"- Right, one of my heroes. "
6556.97,"- Yeah, a wonderful colleague "
6558.5,who unfortunately we lost a few years ago. 
6560.1,"But listen David, this has been wonderful. "
6564.17,- It's been a blast. 
6565.003,- We really appreciate you taking the time to do this 
6566.82,as people probably realize by now 
6569.31,you're an incredible wealth of knowledge 
6571.04,"about the entire nervous system, "
6572.97,today we just hit this top contour 
6575.24,of a number of different areas 
6576.37,to give a flavor of the different ways 
6578.34,that the nervous system works and is organized 
6581.03,"and how that's put together, "
6583.35,how these areas are talking to one another. 
6585.23,What I love about you 
6586.063,is that you're such an incredible educator 
6587.889,and I've taught so many students over the years. 
6590.46,"But also for me personally as friends, "
6594.21,but also any time that I want to touch into the the beauty 
6597.85,"of the nervous system, I rarely lose touch with it. "
6600.75,But anytime I want to touch into it 
6602.14,and start thinking about new problems 
6603.92,and ways that the nervous system is doing things 
6606.49,"that I hadn't thought about, I call you. "
6608.36,"So please forgive me for the calls past, present and future "
6612.77,unless you change your number. 
6613.603,"And even if you do, I'll be calling. "
6616.19,- It's been such a blast Andy. 
6618.213,This has been a great session 
6621.03,and it's always fun talking to you. 
6622.66,"It always gets my brain racing, so thank you. "
6627.91,"- Thank you, thank you for joining me today "
6629.92,for my discussion with Dr. David Berson. 
6632.33,"By now, you should have a much clearer understanding "
6635.22,of how the brain is organized and how it works 
6638.24,to do all the incredible things that it does.

6678.24,"While today's discussion did not focus on supplements, "
6681.6,many previous podcast episodes 
6683.24,include discussions about supplements. 
6685.22,"And while supplements aren't necessary for everybody, "
6688.24,many people derive benefit from them for things like sleep 
6691.1,or focus or anxiety relief and so on. 
6693.93,"One issue with the supplement industry however, "
6696.15,is that oftentimes the quality 
6698.06,will really vary across brands. 
6700.59,"That's why we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, "
6703.08,because Thorne supplements 
6704.56,are of the absolute highest standards 
6706.27,in terms of the quality of the ingredients that include 
6708.54,and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients 
6710.64,"they include, in other words, "
6711.99,"what's listed on the bottle, "
6713.13,"is what's actually found in the bottle, "
6714.9,which is not true of many supplements out there
