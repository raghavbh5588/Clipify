0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
2.28,where we discuss science
3.71,and science-based tools for everyday life.
6.044,[upbeat rock music]
9.43,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
10.37,and I'm a professor of
neurobiology,and ophthalmology
12.87,at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.0,"Today, we are talking all"
about,food and the brain.
18.17,We are going to talk about
19.12,foods that are good for your
brain,"in terms of focus,"
22.76,"in terms of brain health generally,"
24.6,"and the longevity of your brain,"
26.54,your ability to maintain cognition
28.81,and clear thinking over time.
31.05,We are also going to talk about why
33.33,and how you prefer
certain,foods to others.
36.35,And I'm going to talk about
the,three major signals
38.86,that combine to drive your food choices.
42.84,I'll give you a little
hint,of what those are.
45.19,One of those signals comes from your gut
47.61,and is completely subconscious.
49.91,"This is not the gut microbiome, per se."
52.54,These are neurons in your gut
53.96,that are sending signals to your brain
55.49,that you are unaware of
57.2,about the nutrient contents of
the,foods that you're eating.
60.52,The second signal is
62.55,how metabolically
accessible,"a given food is,"
65.83,meaning how readily that food
67.99,can be converted into
energy,"that your brain,"
70.63,"not your body,"
71.463,but that your brain can use.
73.89,And the third signal is perhaps
the,most interesting one.
77.23,It's the signal of belief.
78.94,It's the signal of what you perceive
81.15,and believe the food that
you're,"eating to contain,"
84.85,and what you think it can
do,for you health-wise
87.55,and energy-wise.
88.98,And that might sound a
little,"wishy-washy or vague,"
91.22,but we're going to
provide,mechanistic data
94.11,to support the fact that
you,can change what you eat
97.87,so much so that you can drive your brain
101.79,and your body to crave
foods,"that are good for you,"
104.91,or at least better for you
106.76,than the foods you might
currently,be eating.
108.92,This is an incredibly powerful
mechanism,that we all have.
112.61,It's one that I think is
very,underappreciated.
115.2,"And today, I'm going to review the data"
116.91,"from both animal models,"
118.05,"and fortunately, more"
"recently,","human studies,"
120.98,that really do underscore the fact
123.0,that you can control your
desire,for particular foods.
127.4,"Before we dive into today's topic,"
129.6,I just want to briefly touch on
131.62,some key takeaways from
a,"previous episode,"
134.62,which is the episode on
time,"restricted feeding,"
137.56,also called intermittent fasting.
140.21,The key elements of
time,restricted feeding
143.48,"that will benefit your health the most,"
145.97,"in terms of weight loss or maintenance,"
148.35,"fat loss, organ health,"
quality,"sleep, and cognition,"
153.22,are that the feeding window begin
155.28,at least one hour after waking.
158.22,You could push that feeding
window,"out to begin later,"
160.8,but at least one hour after waking.
163.437,"And that it end at least two,"
166.35,"and ideally, three hours"
before,going to sleep.
170.57,Some people can end that feeding window
172.98,much further away from
the,"beginning of sleep,"
176.32,meaning they're finishing
their,"last bite of food,"
178.89,"for instance, at 6:00 PM,"
180.12,and they're not going
to,sleep until midnight.
181.86,But many people struggle
to,get quality sleep
184.68,if that feeding window is set too early
187.7,relative to when they go to sleep.
189.2,So begin the feeding window at
least,one hour after waking.
193.447,End the feeding window
194.67,at least two hours before going to sleep.
197.2,And a key feature based on
the,"scientific research,"
201.23,is that the feeding window itself
203.5,fall more or less at the same
period,of each 24 hour day
207.81,from day to day.
209.14,"Meaning, if you are going to"
eat,"over an eight hour period,"
212.6,"that's your feeding window,"
214.27,you wouldn't want to
start,that feeding window
216.88,"at 10:00 AM one day and end it at 6:00 PM,"
219.2,"and then the next day, start"
at,"noon and end it at 8:00 PM,"
222.048,"and the next day, start it at 2:00 PM"
224.426,"and end it at 10:00 PM, and so forth."
226.94,"As much as is reasonably possible,"
229.78,if you want to extract the maximum
231.42,"benefit from time restricted feeding,"
233.4,the idea is to keep
that,"feeding window at,"
236.69,"more or less, the same"
"phase,","as it's called,"
239.38,of each 24 hour day.
241.27,If it slides around a little
bit,for social reasons
243.62,"or whatever reasons,"
244.92,"it doesn't seem to be a big deal,"
246.57,but you don't want it sliding around
248.64,"by many hours from day to day,"
250.83,because of the way that
that,feeding window
252.83,impacts other genes called clock genes
255.08,that regulate a bunch of
other,processes in the body.
258.39,"Before we begin,"
259.4,I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
261.2,is separate from my teaching
and,research roles at Stanford.
264.28,"It is, however, part of my desire"
265.97,and effort to bring zero
cost,to consumer information
268.65,about science and science related tools
270.87,to the general public.
272.36,"In keeping with that theme,"
273.79,I'd like to thank the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
276.82,Our first sponsor is ROKA.
279.03,ROKA makes eyeglasses
and,sunglasses that are
281.28,of the absolute highest quality.
283.95,I've spent a career working
on,"the visual system,"
286.5,and one of the key problems
288.1,"that ROKA sunglasses has solved is,"
291.2,"if you've ever worn sunglasses,"
292.47,and you've gone from a
very,"bright region to, say,"
294.79,"a region with shadows,"
296.03,"oftentimes, you have to"
take,the sunglasses off.
298.38,They've designed their
sunglasses,"in a way,"
300.14,that no matter whether
you're,standing in the shade
302.89,"or in bright sunlight,"
304.03,you always see things with
absolute,"crystal clarity,"
307.1,which is wonderful.
308.22,Their eyeglasses as well are designed
310.34,so that you can move from
311.173,one region of brightness to another
312.84,without noticing it at all.
314.55,The other thing that's really terrific
315.94,"about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,"
317.82,is that they are very lightweight.
319.27,"Most of the time,"
320.103,you don't even remember
that,they're on your face.
321.74,And you can wear them
322.91,whether or not you're
exercising,"or working,"
325.54,because they won't slip
"off,",even if you get sweaty.
329.52,"The other thing that's really wonderful,"
330.88,is that the aesthetic is terrific.
332.67,Unlike a lot of so-called
performance,glasses out there
335.59,"that make people look like cyborgs,"
337.34,"or frankly, just look rather strange,"
339.53,ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses
have,a terrific aesthetic.
342.41,"You could wear them to dinner,"
to,"work, running, exercising,"
345.95,and they'll work for all those situations.
348.18,"If you'd like to try ROKA,"
349.47,you can go to ROKA.com.
351.26,That's R-O-K-A.com and
enter,the code: Huberman
354.82,to save 20% on your first order.
357.59,Today's episode is also brought
to,us by Athletic Greens.
360.71,Athletic Greens is a vitamin
mineral,probiotic drink
363.75,that's designed to cover your
foundational,supplementation
367.17,and health needs.
368.53,I've been using Athletic
Greens,"since 2012,"
370.95,so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
373.58,The reason I started
using,"Athletic Greens,"
375.36,and the reason I still drink
376.42,"Athletic Greens once or twice per day,"
378.64,is because it covers all of my
vitamin,"mineral basic needs,"
382.24,and because of the probiotics.
384.38,There's now ample data supporting the fact
386.32,that probiotics support
a,"healthy gut microbiome,"
390.11,and that the gut microbiome is important
392.31,for keeping inflammation
"low,","which is good,"
395.66,as well as for supporting
the,"immune system,"
397.63,and for supporting brain health
399.36,through the so-called gut brain access.
401.76,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,"
403.27,you can go to Athleticgreens.com/Huberman.
406.21,"And if you do that, you"
can,claim a special offer.
408.65,They'll give you five free travel packs.
410.33,So these packs make it really
easy,to mix up Athletic Greens
412.77,"when you're on the road,"
in,"the car, et cetera."
415.05,And they'll give you a year
supply,of vitamin D3/K2.
418.8,There's now a lot of
data,pointing to the fact
421.039,that vitamin D3 and K2 are
important,"for hormonal health,"
425.23,for cardiovascular function.
426.91,And so if you go to
"Athleticgreens.com/Huberman,",
429.88,"you'll get the Athletic Greens,"
the,"five free travel packs,"
432.07,and a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.
435.23,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by Headspace.
438.49,Headspace is a meditation app
440.13,backed by 25 peer-reviewed
published,studies.
443.79,"I think by now, most people have heard"
446.08,of the benefits of meditation.
448.04,"Reduce stress, improves sleep,"
better,"cognition, et cetera."
452.05,"I've been meditating for a long time,"
454.04,"but I have to admit,"
455.97,it's been sort of an on and off thing.
457.45,There are periods of
time,"over the last 10,"
459.91,"or gosh, even 20 or 30 years,"
461.97,"that I've meditated consistently,"
463.58,and then I'll stop meditating.
465.26,One of the terrific things about Headspace
466.98,is that it has meditations
of,different duration
469.19,and different type.
470.32,"And so I found, that as soon"
as,"I started using Headspace,"
473.06,that I was meditating
far,more consistently.
475.99,One of the great things about meditation
477.78,"is that it works the first time,"
479.88,and it works every time.
481.14,"And the more consistently I do it,"
483.57,the more positive
benefits,I seem to derive.
486.38,"If you'd like to try Headspace,"
487.61,you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
490.79,"And if you do that,"
491.88,you'll get a free one month trial
493.64,with all of Headspace's
full,library of meditations.
496.91,This is the best deal offered
by,Headspace right now.
499.33,"So if you're interested,"
500.57,go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
503.58,I'd like to point you toward
504.55,what I think is a very valuable
zero,cost resource online.
508.57,"Recently, I took part in an"
event,called Rethink Education
512.61,that was put on by Logitech.
514.37,"And there, I gave a 20 minute lecture"
516.82,where I describe the classic
519.26,and modern neuroplasticity literature
522.12,in both animal models and humans.
524.15,The neuro-plasticity
literature,"is, of course,"
526.01,the literature that describes
527.26,how to rewire the brain in order to learn.
530.64,"During that 20 minute talk,"
531.88,"I describe that literature,"
532.93,but I also spell out what I call
535.04,"the neuroplasticity super protocol,"
537.19,which is nine-plus steps of things
539.96,that teachers can apply in the classroom
542.26,"to teach any sort of information,"
543.93,"music, math, sports, anything,"
546.89,and that students of any kind in any age
549.27,can use to enhance the
speed,and depth of learning.
552.27,You can find that talk on YouTube
554.67,by following the link in
the,"caption to this episode,"
557.65,or by simply going to YouTube
559.17,and entering the search
terms:,Logitech Huberman.
562.22,Some of the most frequent questions I get
563.85,are about food and the brain.
566.36,Everybody seems to want to
know,what they should eat
568.69,and what they shouldn't eat
570.2,"in order to have peak brain function,"
572.13,"to be able to focus, and"
memorize,"things, and so forth,"
575.62,and in order to maintain
brain,"health over time,"
578.42,because nobody wants to lose their memory
580.65,or have troubles with cognition.
583.21,"Fortunately, there are a lot of data now"
585.37,from really good quality
peer-reviewed,studies
588.54,that indicate certain
things,"that we can do,"
590.86,including certain foods
that,"we should eat,"
593.29,"and perhaps, even some"
foods,"that we should avoid,"
595.7,in order to enhance our brain function.
598.4,"And, of course, when I say, brain,"
599.75,what I really mean is
nervous,"system function,"
601.73,"because how we are able to move,"
604.27,"and remember things, et cetera,"
605.94,"doesn't just depend on the neurons,"
607.53,"the nerve cells that are in our head,"
608.82,"it also depends on our spinal cord,"
611.04,and the neurons that connect
to,all the organs of our body.
613.91,"So in general,"
615.94,there are two categories of things
617.4,that are going to improve brain health
619.72,from the perspective of nutrition.
622.03,The first category is the general category
625.3,"of things that we eat and avoid,"
627.12,"and things that we do and avoid doing,"
629.4,that will modulate brain
health,and function.
632.21,What do I mean by modulate?
633.64,"Well, getting quality"
sleep,on a regular basis.
638.21,Making sure that you're
socially,connected.
640.58,Making sure that you're not depressed.
642.71,All these things are vitally important
644.4,"to our overall health ,"
645.61,"and, of course, they will"
impact,"brain function,"
647.78,"but they do it, more or"
"less,","indirectly, okay?"
650.44,There are a few things
that,happen in sleep
652.04,"which directly benefit brain function,"
654.58,"and repair, et cetera."
656.13,"But today, I really want to concentrate,"
657.88,not on the things that
modulate,"our overall health,"
660.88,"but rather, the things that"
mediate,"brain health directly,"
664.57,"and in particular, how certain"
foods,enhance brain function.
668.72,And we are going to talk about
670.35,how we can change our
relationship,to food.
672.75,"Literally, how we can start"
to,prefer certain foods
675.81,that are better for us than others.
678.38,"So just briefly, I want to touch"
on,"the modulatory components,"
682.11,because they are vital.
684.09,"First of all,"
685.4,getting quality sleep on a regular basis
688.04,and ample sleep on a regular basis
690.48,is the foundation of all mental
health,and physical health.
694.77,There's no question about that.
696.36,"We've have done several episodes,"
698.09,including the Mastering
Your,"Sleep episode,"
700.37,which is episode two of
the,Huberman Lab Podcast.
702.61,And we've done a lot of other episodes
704.67,"that are all about sleep,"
705.96,and how to get better at sleeping.
707.83,"So I just want to make crystal clear,"
710.46,that unless you're sleeping
well,"on a regular basis,"
713.51,your brain will suffer.
714.61,You won't be able to focus
very,"well, learn very well,"
716.77,"and indeed, there are data linking"
719.36,"poor quality sleep to dementia,"
721.96,or at least exacerbating
pre-existing,"dementias,"
724.85,and things of that sort.
725.7,So get your sleep in order.
727.3,"The other, of course, is"
cardiovascular,health and exercise.
730.91,The general prescription that's
out,"there in the literature,"
733.86,"and I think is well supported,"
735.44,is to get somewhere
between,150 and 180 minutes
739.13,of cardiovascular exercise per week.
741.25,If you choose to also use
resistance,"exercise, that's great."
744.58,But the 150 to 180
minutes,minimum per week
748.75,of cardiovascular exercise
750.37,"is crucial for heart health,"
752.84,and heart health directly
relates,"to brain health,"
755.47,because the brain consumes
a,"lot of oxygen, glucose,"
758.68,and other factors that are
delivered,via the blood.
761.57,"So if your arteries are clogged up,"
763.61,and you've got poor
vascular,supply to the brain
766.43,"in any region of the brain,"
767.7,your brain will suffer.
769.3,So get cardiovascular health in order.
772.38,"Now, with those two"
modulatory,"elements set forth,"
776.68,so that we're all aware that they're there
778.1,"and they are vitally important,"
779.53,"now, I'd like to turn to the"
elements,that have been shown
782.21,to be vitally important
for,"directly controlling,"
784.99,for mediating neuron function.
787.31,"Neurons, of course, are"
nerve,"cells in the brain,"
789.64,and there are other cell
"types,","too, of course,"
792.0,that will impact brain function.
794.01,The most prominent of which
are,the so-called glia.
797.42,Glia means glue.
798.68,"But even though, for a long time,"
800.79,people thought that these cells
801.69,were just kind of holding
things,"together passively,"
803.59,the glia play a very active role
806.31,in the metabolism neurons
in,"brain function,"
809.06,"and probably, also, in cognition,"
811.14,"in thinking, and so forth."
813.41,So what are the things that
directly,"impact brain health,"
817.05,and what are the foods that we can eat
818.87,that will support brain health?
820.73,"Generally, when we think"
about,neuron function
822.487,"and brain function,"
824.23,we default to a discussion about fuel.
826.97,The fact that neurons use
"glucose,","which is blood sugar,"
830.95,and that they require a lot of it.
832.77,"In some cases, they'll use ketones,"
834.59,which we will talk about
a,"little bit later,"
836.25,especially in people that are
following,a low carbohydrate
838.48,or ketogenic diet.
840.47,But before we can even consider the fuels
842.98,"that neurons use in order to function,"
845.32,we have to talk about
846.62,the elements that actually
allow,those neurons to be there
849.68,"and to stay healthy,"
851.02,what actually makes up those neurons.
852.8,"And that brings us to, what I would argue,"
854.71,is the most important food
element,"for brain function,"
859.41,and that is fat.
861.23,"And that may come as a surprise,"
862.9,but unless one considers the
water,"content of the brain,"
866.14,"which is very high,"
868.4,"a lot of our brain,"
869.58,and a lot of the integrity
of,"the nerve cells,"
871.82,"the so-called neurons in our brain,"
873.88,and the other types of
cells,comes from fat.
876.95,And that's because nerve cells
and,other cells in the brain
879.87,have a external layer.
882.99,It's what's sometimes called
a,double-layered membrane.
886.61,It's essentially two thin layers
888.32,that serve as a boundary
between,"those cells,"
889.967,"and that boundary is important,"
891.71,because how things pass
across,that boundary
894.25,actually regulates the
electrical,"activity of neurons,"
897.6,which is the way that neurons
"fire,","and communicate,"
899.9,"and keep you thinking, and acting,"
901.15,and doing all the good things
902.09,that those neurons allow us to do.
904.27,"And those membranes are made up of fats,"
906.83,but they're not made up of the fats
908.09,"that are around our belly,"
910.29,around the other organs of our body.
912.0,They're not made up of storage fat.
913.64,They are made up of structural fat.
916.4,And maintaining the so-called integrity
918.38,"of that structural fat,"
919.87,"meaning the health of those neurons,"
922.02,"is going to come, in large part,"
923.9,from the foods that we eat.
925.85,"Now, this needs to be underscored."
927.99,"What I'm saying is, that"
the,foods that we eat
930.06,actually provide the structural
"basis,","the building blocks,"
933.1,of the very neurons that
allow,us to think over time.
936.69,"And as I mentioned earlier,"
938.47,the fat that makes up those
neurons,and other nerve cells
940.92,is different than the other
types,of fat in the body.
944.21,"So what type of fat is it,"
945.44,and what should we eat
946.77,in order to support that
fat,and those neurons?
950.55,And the answer is
951.57,the so-called essential fatty
acids,and phospholipids.
954.82,"Now, those are, more or"
"less,","the same thing,"
956.44,but I just want to make
a,very large literature
958.88,very crystal clear.
961.05,Essential fatty acids can include
962.98,the so-called EPA variety or DHA variety.
966.42,You hear about omega-3s and omega-6s.
969.08,Most people are getting enough
omega-6s,from their diet.
972.51,"Not everybody, but most people"
are,getting enough omega-6s.
975.28,"However, most people"
are,not getting enough
978.41,omega-3s in their diet to
support,healthy brain function
981.38,in the short and long-term.
983.05,I've talked before about the benefits of
985.41,elevating the levels of
omega-3s,in one's diet
988.27,for sake of offsetting depression
and,for enhancing mood.
991.87,"And indeed, there's a"
wealth,of literature now
994.37,pointing to the fact that
ingesting,"at least one, or two,"
998.01,or even three grams per day of
1000.532,EPA form of essential fatty acid
1003.7,"can have effects, positive effects,"
1006.1,on mood and wellbeing
that,are at least on par
1008.32,with some of the major
antidepressant,"treatments out there,"
1010.59,but without similar side effects
1012.67,to those antidepressant treatments.
1014.21,And that for people that are
already,"taking antidepressants,"
1017.92,"that supplementing with one, to two,"
1020.35,to three grams of EPA
essential,fatty acids
1023.76,can actually allow a lower dose of
1026.32,"antidepressant treatment to be used,"
1028.03,and still be effective.
1029.38,So that's depression.
1030.97,But just in terms of maintaining
normal,cognitive function
1033.86,"in people that aren't depressed,"
1035.08,the EPAs and omega-3s seem to
play,a very important role.
1039.29,"Of course, you can supplement EPAs"
1041.75,"through various fish oils,"
1043.24,and it could be liquid fish
"oil,",or a capsule fish oil.
1046.3,"Some people, if they're not"
interested,in eating fish
1049.1,"for whatever reason,"
1050.11,"they're allergic, or for ethical reasons,"
1051.95,they can take krill oil.
1053.26,"And if they don't want to use krill oil,"
1054.8,they can use algae and other forms of EPA.
1057.73,"However, I think it's clear,"
1060.3,that one can get a lot of
EPA,from the proper foods.
1063.87,"And it turns out, that those"
"foods,","not surprisingly,"
1066.82,"don't just contain high levels of EPA,"
1069.38,but they also contain other things
1071.16,that are beneficial for brain health.
1073.02,So what are foods that
are,high in omega-3s
1075.89,"that we should all probably be consuming,"
1078.03,at least on a daily basis?
1081.02,The number one is fish.
1083.38,"So things like mackerel,"
and,"salmon, and herring,"
1086.35,"and oysters, and sardines, and anchovies."
1089.33,"And perhaps, the heavyweight champion"
1091.35,of EPAs per unit volume is caviar.
1094.28,"Now, I don't know about you,"
1095.67,but I'm not eating a lot of fish.
1097.46,I'm not eating a lot of caviar.
1099.58,I don't think...
1100.413,I can't remember the
last,"time I had a caviar,"
1102.15,unless it was sprinkled
on,a little bit of sushi.
1104.61,I'm not a big fish eater personally.
1107.56,I will from time to time.
1108.94,But that's one reason why
1110.41,one might want to supplement
with,EPAs from another source.
1114.69,"But also, EPAs are found"
in,"chia seeds, in walnuts,"
1119.63,"in soybeans, and other plant-based foods."
1122.01,"You can look these up online,"
1123.55,and you'll immediately see
1124.94,that there are a lot of sources of EPAs.
1127.57,And many of the foods that I listed off
1129.79,"might be appetizing to you,"
1131.07,"some of them might be unappetizing to you,"
1132.78,or some of them you might
be,sort of neutral about.
1135.23,"But it's very clear,"
1136.17,that eating foods that
are,"rich in omega-3s,"
1138.68,"and/or supplementing with omega-3s,"
1140.36,"to get above that 1.5 grams,"
1142.92,"and ideally, up to two,"
or,"even three grams,"
1145.5,per day of EPA can be very
beneficial,for cognitive function
1150.28,in the short and long-term.
1152.57,"Later in the episode,"
1153.65,I'm going talk about
1154.57,how to actually change your relationship
1157.04,"to particular foods,"
1157.93,so that foods that you
don't,"particularly like,"
1159.76,"you can actually start to like more,"
1161.86,and that might be
important,for those of you
1163.61,"that are thinking, mackerel, sardines."
1165.607,"I'm making this face,"
1167.03,"'cause, frankly, those are not"
foods,that I naturally like.
1170.35,"But again, I want to emphasize,"
1171.78,that you don't have to consume fish
1173.76,and animal products in order
to,get sufficient EPAs.
1175.89,You can get them from plants.
1177.17,"But I do believe,"
1178.65,based on the quality
peer-reviewed,"research,"
1181.29,that everybody should be striving
to,get a minimum threshold
1184.64,of at least a gram and
a,half of EPAs per day
1186.8,one way or the other.
1188.4,The great thing about omega-3s
1189.93,is that they are also
thought,to be beneficial
1191.95,for things like cardiovascular health.
1193.71,And although there's
some,controversy there
1196.03,as to whether or not two
"grams,","or three grams,"
1198.87,or six grams is ideal for
cardiovascular,"health,"
1201.01,I think the bulk of
evidence,points to the fact
1203.31,that getting sufficient
omega-3s,in the diet
1205.26,is going to support cardiovascular health.
1207.83,Certainly not the only
thing,people should be doing
1209.58,to support their cardiovascular health.
1211.54,"Aerobic exercise, and so"
"forth,",being important also.
1214.68,But it does seem to support
cardio,"vascular health,"
1217.447,"and in doing so, supporting brain health."
1220.17,"However, what I'm emphasizing is,"
1223.4,ingestion of omega-3s to support
1226.16,the very cells within the brain
1227.8,"that make up our cognition,"
1229.04,"that allow for cognition,"
and,"for movement, and memory,"
1231.71,and all the other marvelous
things,that the brain does.
1235.04,The other compound that has been shown
1236.72,to be directly supportive
of,neuronal function
1239.54,"is phosphatidylserine,"
1241.51,which is abundant in meats and in fish.
1244.95,So here we are again
1245.8,back to fish being an important source
1247.83,of brain supporting food.
1250.24,Phosphatidylserine is
something,"that, nowadays,"
1253.23,people are supplementing.
1254.45,"It's a lipid-like compound that,"
1256.98,"at least in three studies,"
1259.34,have been shown to improve cognition.
1261.06,"These weren't huge effects,"
1262.31,but they were statistically
significant,effects.
1264.73,"And as well in more than three,"
1267.77,"at least five studies,"
1269.43,to reduce cognitive decline.
1271.89,And this is interesting.
1272.82,"In every case,"
1273.653,it was 300 milligrams
supplemented,"phosphatidylserine,"
1277.53,"but one, again,"
1278.363,doesn't need to supplement
phosphatidylserine.,
1281.16,Phosphatidylserine can be
"derived,","as I mentioned,"
1283.75,"from meats and fish,"
1284.96,"and to some extent, from"
cabbage,of all things.
1287.07,So I don't know how much
cabbage,people are ingesting.
1289.47,"But later, when we talk about gut health,"
1291.1,and the relationship between
gut,"health and brain health,"
1294.43,I'll mention fermented foods.
1296.1,"And, of course, one of the most"
1298.37,readily available
fermented,foods out there
1300.17,that at least many people
find,"appetizing is sauerkraut,"
1303.79,"which is, of course, made from cabbage."
1305.21,It's fermented cabbage.
1306.47,So for those of you that
do,"consume meat and fish,"
1309.73,"provided you're getting enough fish,"
1310.93,you're probably getting
enough,phosphatidylserine.
1312.9,For those of you that are interested in
1314.16,supplementing phosphatidylserine
to,get these effects
1317.18,that were reported in
these,"various manuscripts,"
1320.62,"which, by the way, I've"
"read,",and looked solid.
1323.09,"I mean, I don't think we've seen"
1324.59,the landmark study showing
1326.22,that supplementing with phosphatidylserine
1328.04,at 300 milligrams per day
1329.61,is going to create a huge offsetting
1332.69,"of a massive cognitive decline,"
1334.26,or a massive increase in brain function.
1336.52,"These seem to be modest effects,"
1338.64,but the effects do appear to be real.
1341.03,For those of you that are interested
1342.03,"in supplementing with phosphatidylserine,"
1343.94,it's a relatively
inexpensive,"supplement that,"
1346.51,"again, is lipid-like."
1347.69,So it's mimicking some of the same things
1349.44,"that you would get from food,"
1350.38,but in a higher concentration.
1352.6,"Now, after EPA, fatty acids,"
and,"phosphatidylserine,"
1358.09,"I would say, third on the list"
1359.8,of things that come from food
1361.74,that can readily support brain
function,"would be choline,"
1365.38,and that's because of the
relationship,to choline
1367.69,in the biosynthesis pathway
for,a acetylcholine.
1371.18,"Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator,"
1373.36,"not a neurotransmitter,"
1374.44,but a neuromodulator in the brain.
1376.743,A neuromodulator is a
chemical,that modulates
1380.26,"the function of many brain circuits,"
1382.52,"and also, circuits within the body."
1384.72,I'll mention what those are in a moment.
1386.43,"But acetylcholine, as a neuromodulator,"
1389.67,"tends to enhance the activity,"
1391.93,the electrical activity
and,"chemical activity,"
1393.98,"of certain sets of neurons,"
1395.74,and downplay the activity
of,other neurons.
1398.75,So it's sort of a conductor of sorts
1400.72,leading to enhanced function
1402.89,and activity in certain
brain,"areas and circuits,"
1405.19,and not in others.
1407.64,"For instance, the brain"
areas,that are involved
1409.97,in focus and alertness.
1411.57,We have multiple clusters
of,neurons in our brain
1413.98,that make acetylcholine.
1415.89,Two of the most prominent and well-known
1417.65,"are the so-called nucleus basalis,"
1419.05,which is a cluster of neurons
1420.51,deep in the basal forebrain
1422.13,that highlight particular
areas,of our brain.
1424.9,Highlight meaning when acetylcholine
1427.19,is released from those neurons
1428.89,at their nerve endings in
particular,"areas of the brain,"
1431.01,those particular areas of the brain
1432.72,can undergo enhanced levels of activity
1434.76,relative to surrounding area.
1436.3,So it's kind of a
electrical,"highlighter pen,"
1438.62,"if you will, by analogy."
1441.72,That is the basis of much
of,"what we call focus,"
1445.39,or our ability to concentrate
1447.22,on a particular batch of information
1449.35,that's coming in through our
"eyes,","our ears, our nose,"
1451.32,or even things that we're
just,thinking in our head.
1453.55,So having ample choline for
production,of acetylcholine
1457.64,"allows for focus through, of"
"course,",many intervening steps.
1461.23,There are also regions of the brain
1463.02,in the so-called back of
the,"brain, the hindbrain,"
1465.27,that release acetylcholine
1467.08,that are involved in
general,states of alertness.
1470.24,"And not surprisingly then,"
1472.51,many of the treatments
for,"Alzheimer's disease,"
1474.97,which is an inability
1476.71,or challenges with remembering
things,"and focusing,"
1480.21,are drugs that impact the
acetylcholine,"pathway,"
1484.18,and are aimed at enhancing
the,amount of acetylcholine
1487.57,that's available to neurons.
1489.53,And it can do that through a
number,of different mechanisms.
1491.78,You can do that by enhancing
1492.93,the amount of acetylcholine
that's,"created,"
1494.87,or you can do that by taking a drug
1497.62,that can reduce the amount of enzyme
1499.88,"that gobbles up the acetylcholine,"
1501.25,"and in doing so, leading"
to,more net acetylcholine.
1504.32,But outside of the scenario
1506.4,where somebody has cognitive
decline,"due to Alzheimer's,"
1509.4,all of us are able to focus
to,"some degree, or not,"
1513.04,or are able to be alert
to,"some degree, or not,"
1515.82,based on the amount of
acetylcholine,that we have.
1519.01,"Now, other processes,"
of,"course, are involved."
1521.07,"But what this means,"
1522.08,is that making sure that we have enough
1524.47,of the substrates to create
acetylcholine,is vital
1527.95,"if we want to be able to focus,"
1529.5,and that's why dietary
choline,is so vital.
1531.77,And the primary source for
dietary,"choline would be eggs,"
1535.28,"and in particular, egg yolks."
1537.03,"And this, again, has a very"
interesting,relationship
1539.73,to our evolution as well.
1542.33,We're always referred
to,"as hunter gatherers,"
1544.59,"but when one hears hunters,"
1545.97,we often think about
meat,and animal sources.
1548.56,"And indeed, as a species,"
1550.1,"we hunted many, many"
other,species of animals
1553.29,"to consume them, and still do."
1555.26,But we also fished.
1556.69,We talked about that earlier.
1557.8,"And consumed a lot of fish,"
1559.147,and we consumed a lot of eggs.
1561.08,Eggs are an incredibly rich source
1563.83,"of nutrients for the brain,"
1566.84,"and that's because the egg, actually,"
1569.8,"if you think about it,"
1570.633,contains all the nutrients
that,are required
1572.71,in order for an organism to grow.
1575.23,"You know, a bird that's in a egg shell,"
1578.1,"it's got the yolk there,"
1578.98,and it's using that yolk for a reason.
1580.98,It's using that yolk as a source of fuel.
1583.78,It's using that yolk
1584.62,"as a source of, literally, building blocks"
1586.83,in order to create its nervous system.
1588.47,"Many years ago, I worked on chick embryos,"
1591.55,and it was these amazing experiments.
1592.96,"You could actually take an egg,"
1594.92,and you could create a
little,"window in the top,"
1597.42,"and these were fertilized eggs,"
1598.74,"and you'd see, over time,"
you,"could peer in there,"
1600.95,"literally look in with a microscope,"
1602.42,"or even with the naked eye,"
1603.6,and you would see this little chick embryo
1605.89,sitting on top of that
yolk,"growing, and growing,"
1607.71,"and growing, and growing,"
1608.55,"and the yolk getting smaller, and smaller."
1610.3,"It's really, yeah, incredible."
1612.08,They're using that as a source
1613.47,"for all the building blocks of the body,"
1615.3,"but in particular, the nervous system."
1617.52,So eggs are a rich source of choline.
1619.47,Some people will supplement with choline.
1622.81,"However, food sources seem to"
be,the best source of choline.
1626.84,"And as with the EPAs and the omega-3s,"
1629.44,there are plenty of foods
that,are non-animal-based
1632.43,that contain choline.
1634.39,So if you're somebody
who,"doesn't eat eggs,"
1636.56,"or doesn't want to eat eggs,"
1637.83,"things like potatoes, nuts, and seeds,"
1639.83,"and grains, and fruit,"
1640.97,"they don't have as much choline as eggs,"
1642.94,but they do contain choline.
1644.49,So you can look up the values of choline
1646.27,"that are present in those various foods,"
1649.31,and make sure that you're
reaching,the threshold
1651.881,amount of choline for you.
1652.714,"In general, most people"
should,probably strive
1654.62,to get somewhere between 500 milligrams
1656.73,and a gram of choline per day.
1658.65,"So 1,000 milligrams."
1659.95,And some people rely on supplementation
1661.953,"in order to hit those levels,"
1663.88,because they're not
eating,"a lot of egg yolks,"
1665.57,or they're not eating
a,lot of other foods.
1667.98,Certain fish contain
"choline,","for instance,"
1670.52,and the other foods I
listed,off a few minutes ago
1672.93,from plant-based sources.
1675.0,So some people will supplement with
1678.1,"50 to 100 milligrams,"
1679.75,or whatever amount is necessary
1681.24,"to get them up to that one gram,"
1682.85,"or even a two gram, dose per day."
1684.72,So we have three things
1686.05,that we know can support nerve cells.
1689.607,"EPA, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,"
1693.29,"phosphatidylserine, and choline,"
1696.28,those three things I would list off
1697.92,as the top three things
1699.72,"for enhancing neuron function,"
1702.74,and the integrity of neurons
in,the short and long-term.
1705.34,"And this, again, is setting aside"
1707.62,the vitally important factors
of,hydration and electrolytes.
1711.09,"I've said it before on other podcasts,"
1712.52,"but if you're not ingesting enough water,"
1714.75,"and you're not getting enough sodium,"
1716.25,"and magnesium, and potassium,"
1718.2,"then, obviously, your neurons can't run,"
1720.11,because a lot of the brain is water.
1722.65,You need to maintain proper hydration.
1724.24,"And sodium, potassium, and"
magnesium,are important
1727.05,in order for nerve cells to function.
1728.4,"In fact, they are actually"
the,"components, the ions,"
1732.15,"that pass across those lipid membranes,"
1734.42,those little fatty membranes
1735.95,"that we were talking about earlier,"
1737.07,that allow the neurons to
generate,electrical activity
1740.0,and communicate with one another.
1741.56,"So definitely, you want to hydrate enough."
1743.86,We will do an entire other episode
1745.4,all about hydration and electrolytes.
1747.1,"But omega-3s, the EPAs,"
"phosphatidylserine,","and choline,"
1753.32,it's obvious are going to
improve,brain function.
1757.13,How much they will improve brain function
1758.64,probably depends on
1759.473,how well your brain
was,working previously.
1760.9,"In fact, many of the studies"
1762.44,that have looked at the
effectiveness,of these compounds
1764.52,have looked in people that
are,suffering from mild
1766.47,or even severe cognitive decline.
1768.72,And while the outcomes
of,"those studies vary,"
1771.96,given the interest in
maintaining,"brain function,"
1774.13,given the fact that we
don't,make new neurons
1776.24,"throughout our entire life,"
1777.78,"and given that everybody has to eat,"
1780.31,these are quality healthy foods
1782.13,that we should all be ingesting anyways.
1784.84,And it's clear that they
can,support brain function
1787.5,to some degree or another.
1788.92,Many people will ask what I do
in,light of this information.
1793.13,And while I can only talk
about,"what works for me,"
1796.21,I choose to ingest fish
oil,"mainly in liquid form,"
1800.11,because that turns out
to,be the easiest way
1802.397,and the most economically affordable way
1805.34,to do it for most people.
1807.47,So there are various forms
of,liquid fish oil out there.
1809.79,"Some of them include some lemon flavoring,"
1811.39,"so it doesn't taste like fish oil,"
1812.72,"because frankly, fish oil, to me,"
1814.52,is sort of noxious tasting.
1816.11,And I'll take a tablespoon
of,"that, or two, per day."
1819.98,"If I'm traveling, I'll"
use,the capsule form
1822.81,in order to hit that threshold.
1824.41,"For me, about two, sometimes even three,"
1827.24,grams per day of EPA.
1829.56,So not just two or three
grams,"per day of fish oil,"
1832.44,but two or three grams per day of EPA.
1834.69,"Now, if I'm eating fish,"
1837.11,which as I mentioned
"earlier,","is not often,"
1839.03,then I might reduce the amount
of,fish oil that I take.
1841.09,But that's my major source of fish oil.
1844.63,"Currently, I do not supplement"
with,phosphatidylserine.
1847.48,"A number of people that I know and trust,"
1849.29,"and indeed, several colleagues of mine,"
1851.129,do take phosphatidylserine.
1853.15,I don't have any good explanation
1854.44,"for why I don't take it yet,"
1855.58,but I have not tried
supplementing,with it yet.
1858.52,"Maybe if some of you have,"
1859.63,you can place your experience
in,the comment section.
1863.79,It would be of interest.
1864.64,"And then in terms of choline,"
1866.72,"in order to get choline in my diet,"
1868.66,I do pay attention to
1870.04,"the various foods that contain choline,"
1872.14,and I try and get those foods
on,a semi-regular basis.
1875.75,I do supplement with
something,"called alpha-GPC,"
1878.53,"which is, essentially, in"
the,"acetylcholine pathway,"
1882.01,or biosynthesis pathway.
1883.84,"I don't take it very often,"
1885.28,but I will take 300 milligrams
1887.35,of alpha-GPC from time to time.
1889.41,"From time to time,"
1890.243,I mean anywhere from two
to,three times per week.
1893.3,"I'll generally do it early in the day,"
1894.74,"'cause it, for me,"
1895.573,can have a little bit
of,a stimulant effect.
1897.59,"Although, it's not nearly"
as,"stimulating, say,"
1900.08,"as a double espresso, or triple espresso."
1902.62,But that's one way in which I
enhance,my choline function.
1906.09,And some people choose to
get,"it from supplementation,"
1908.47,because it's straightforward.
1910.18,There are a lot of supplements out there
1911.013,that contain alpha-GPC.
1912.84,Some people are taking dosages
1914.28,as high as 900 milligrams per day.
1915.95,That sounds very high to me.
1917.27,The studies of offsetting
cognitive,decline using alpha-GPC
1921.25,"did use quite high dosages of 600 to 900,"
1925.36,"or even 1200, milligrams per day."
1927.86,So it has been used at those
much,higher concentrations.
1930.91,"But because, fortunately,"
1933.17,"at least, not yet, or not to my awareness,"
1935.25,I'm not suffering from
any,"cognitive decline,"
1937.47,I will supplement with 300
milligrams,every now and again.
1940.81,Next on my list of compounds
1942.51,that have been shown in
peer-reviewed,research
1944.55,to improve neuronal and
brain,function is creatine.
1948.52,Creatine can be derived from meat sources.
1950.88,It can also be supplemented.
1954.0,Some of you are probably
familiar,with creatine
1956.03,or have heard about creatine
1957.23,from the context of the
health,"and fitness world,"
1959.88,where creatine is used to
bring,"more water into muscles,"
1964.24,which can enhance the
strength,"of those muscles,"
1966.57,as well as bring water into other tissues.
1969.72,It doesn't just draw
more,"water into muscle,"
1971.43,it can draw more water
into,the body generally.
1975.69,Creatine has also been shown to have
1977.37,an important role in brain function.
1979.34,"And once again, this is"
something,that came up
1981.1,during the discussion about
depression,a few episodes back.
1985.2,Creatine can actually be used
as,a fuel source in the brain.
1988.76,And there's some evidence
1990.85,that it can enhance the function
1992.13,of certain frontal cortical
circuits,"that feed down onto,"
1996.78,"or rather, connect to, areas of the brain"
1998.633,that are involved in mood
regulation,and motivation.
2001.2,And that's where creatine
plays,"a role in depression,"
2005.37,"or rather, where creatine supplementation"
2008.47,seems to be able to assist in
some,forms of mild depression.
2012.18,That's an emerging literature.
2013.41,It's still not well-established.
2015.33,"However, there is now ample evidence"
2018.35,that creatine supplementation
can,enhance brain function
2021.35,in certain contexts.
2022.77,And if you're interested in
2024.19,learning more about
what,"those contexts are,"
2026.59,there's an excellent
review,that just came out.
2028.6,The first author is
"Roschel,",R-O-S-C-H-E-L.
2032.48,"We will provide a link to this study,"
2034.66,"rather, this review,"
excuse,"me, in the caption."
2038.24,This was published just
very,recently in 2021.
2041.89,"And one thing to make clear,"
2043.53,is that creatine supplementation
2045.44,has been shown to be especially useful
2047.99,for people that are not consuming any meat
2050.48,or other sources of foods
that,are rich in creatine.
2053.44,What is the threshold level
of,creatine to supplement
2055.97,in order to get the cognitive benefit?
2058.04,It appears to be at
least,five grams per day.
2061.17,"Now, the most typical form of creatine"
2062.59,is so-called creatine monohydrate.
2064.29,"There are other forms of creatine as well,"
2066.37,some of which are thought to not draw
2067.69,"as much water into non-muscle tissues,"
2070.53,"and for some people,"
that's,attractive to them.
2072.93,They don't want water sitting
below,"their skin, et cetera."
2075.62,"I should emphasize,"
2076.453,that the responses to creatine
in,that sense can differ.
2079.68,Some people get a little
bit,of water retention.
2081.7,Some people experience more.
2083.4,There's some evidence
that,creatine can impact
2085.91,"some of the hormonal pathways,"
2087.09,that it might enhance levels of
2088.34,"so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT,"
2090.92,"and therefore, because DHT"
is,"involved in hair loss,"
2093.55,there are these theories that
creatine,can cause hair loss.
2096.58,"And indeed, for people that are"
2097.61,"very DHT sensitive, it might."
2101.38,There's going to be a lot of
variation,person to person
2104.58,"in terms of how much creatine impacts DHT,"
2107.25,and how many DHT receptors
they,"have on their scalp,"
2109.64,"and therefore, whether or not"
they,experience hair loss.
2111.61,"I'm just giving you all this information,"
2113.1,so that you're aware of the various things
2115.07,that creatine can do.
2116.53,"But nonetheless, I think it's interesting"
2118.47,that creatine supplementation
of,"five grams per day,"
2121.15,"that's creatine monohydrate,"
2122.68,has been shown to improve cognition
2124.07,in people that aren't getting
creatine,from animal sources.
2127.24,And there's some evidence
detailed,within the review
2131.1,"that I just described,"
2132.56,that creatine supplementation
can,also enhance cognition
2135.99,in people that are also
eating,animal products.
2140.06,So I personally take
creatine,"five grams per day,"
2142.93,and have for a very long time.
2144.59,I can't say that I've
noticed,"a tremendous benefit,"
2147.53,because I've actually
never,"really come off it,"
2149.667,and so I've never done
the,control experiment.
2151.66,I take it more as kind of a
baseline,insurance policy.
2154.53,"For me, I'm probably losing,"
2157.12,I'm certainly losing some of my hair.
2158.56,Whether or not that's
due,"to creatine or not,"
2161.21,I've never done the analysis.
2163.2,"But what I can say is that,"
2165.21,I generally consume these things
2166.85,"like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC"
2171.29,to set a general context
of,"support for my neurons,"
2176.34,for my brain.
2177.33,"And, of course, I also pay attention"
2179.04,to the foods that contain
these,various compounds.
2181.28,So I don't actively eat additional meat
2183.7,just to obtain creatine.
2186.01,I eat a fairly limited amount of meat.
2187.58,"I don't restrict it,"
2188.76,"and I do eat meat,"
2190.0,but I don't actively seek
out,creatine in my diet.
2193.41,"Rather, I use supplementation"
2194.69,in order to hit that five
grams,per day threshold.
2197.4,Next on the list of foods
2199.38,that are beneficial for brain health
2200.87,is one that you've probably
seen,"pictures of online,"
2203.45,because there seems to be a practice
2205.11,of putting pictures of blueberries
2207.49,and other dark berries next
to,"any title that says,"
2210.627,"""Foods that benefit your brain""."
2213.68,There are a lot of foods out there
2215.09,that have been purported
to,improve brain function.
2218.98,The interesting thing about
blueberries,"and other berries,"
2222.28,"blackberries, dark currants,"
2224.65,any of these thin-skinned berries
2227.11,"that are purpleish in color,"
2229.63,is that they contain what
are,called anthocyanins.
2232.86,Anthocyanins actually
have,some really nice data
2235.61,to support the fact that
they,improve brain function.
2239.05,"Now, whether or not it is"
direct,"effects on neurons,"
2243.01,or whether or not it is
by,"lowering inflammation,"
2246.85,or some other modulatory
"effect,",isn't quite clear.
2250.0,"But I think by now, there's"
enough,data to support the fact
2253.91,that eating a cup or two of
blueberries,"pretty often,"
2256.95,"every day, or maybe you have blackberries,"
2259.51,"or maybe it's black currants,"
2260.97,"that these anthocyanins are good for us,"
2263.77,that they are enhancing
our,overall wellbeing
2266.89,at a number of different levels.
2267.99,And just to give you a couple examples
2269.56,of where there are actually
peer-reviewed,studies
2271.88,"to support those statements,"
2273.94,the anthocyanins of which blueberries
2277.23,and other dark berries are rich in
2280.35,have been shown to reduce
the,"amount of DNA damage,"
2284.45,"has been shown to reduce significantly,"
2287.61,"although, albeit, slightly,"
excuse,"me, cognitive decline."
2291.7,And that particular study was
2293.19,supplementation of a blueberry extract.
2296.43,I'll talk about the
difference,between extract
2297.757,and actual blueberries in a moment.
2299.4,But supplementation of blueberry extract
2302.35,in offsetting cognitive
decline,in elderly people.
2306.22,So what constitutes elderly
2309.15,is always a little bit of
a,debate and a discussion.
2312.53,"But in this case, what they did,"
2314.21,is they supplemented with
somewhere,"between 428,"
2319.51,"I don't know why they selected 428,"
2321.11,and 598 milligrams of
anthocyanins,daily for 12 weeks
2325.57,was associated with improvements
2326.87,on verbal learning and memory.
2329.34,And they had some other beneficial changes
2331.83,"that were within the bodily organs,"
2333.6,and blood glucose
"regulation,",and so forth.
2335.95,Positive changes.
2337.21,But that's one study.
2338.95,"In this case, elderly meant 65 or older."
2342.12,"That study, and a number"
of,"studies like it,"
2344.87,looking at things like
mildly,"enhanced memory,"
2348.59,"reduced insulin levels,"
reduced,"oxidation of LDL,"
2353.4,"these sorts of things,"
2354.69,have basically created a situation where
2357.87,anytime you Google
2359.46,or look up foods that
enhance,"brain function,"
2363.31,you're going to see a
picture,of a blueberry
2365.04,"or some other berry,"
2365.873,because of these anthocyanins.
2368.06,I personally don't
supplement,anthocyanins.
2371.2,I do like blueberries.
2372.24,I eat blueberries when they're in season.
2374.75,I love them.
2375.583,I'm what you would call a
drive-by,blueberry eater.
2377.52,Like if there are blueberries
in,"a bowl on a table,"
2380.49,"and I'm walking by,"
2381.33,"I just have to scoop them up,"
2382.74,"like some sort of bear, or other animal,"
2384.8,and pop them in my mouth.
2385.76,So blueberries don't last long around me.
2388.21,"One of the issues with berries,"
2389.57,"like blueberries, and"
"blackberries,","and so forth,"
2391.27,is that quality sources of
them,can be pretty expensive.
2393.91,"And then, of course, when"
they're,"not in season,"
2395.81,"they're hard to get,"
2396.643,and so that's why some people
will,supplement with them.
2399.1,So that range of about 400 to
about,600 milligrams per day
2404.84,seems to be the minimum threshold
2407.29,for getting a cognitive effect
in,these elderly patients.
2412.38,"In that case, they were patients."
2414.04,A good review about the anthocyanins
2416.0,potentially contributing to
offsetting,cognitive decline
2419.94,"in things like Alzheimer's,"
2421.5,and also enhancing brain function
2423.98,"in people that don't have Alzheimer's,"
2426.3,"is a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L,"
2429.37,that was published in 2019.
2431.22,We will also provide a link
to,that study in the caption.
2435.08,When one looks across the
total,batch of studies
2438.29,"that are out there on this,"
2440.03,"it appears, that if one"
is,going to supplement
2443.2,with blueberry extract to get the
2445.34,"anthocyanin effect on cognition,"
2449.03,dosages of somewhere between
5,1/2 or about 11 grams
2453.4,"seem optimal with the higher end,"
2455.53,closer to 10 or 11 grams
being,more beneficial.
2459.43,"The blueberry eaters out there like me,"
2462.41,who prefer to get their anthocyanins
2463.97,"from the actual berries,"
2465.33,it appears that somewhere
between,60 to 120 grams
2468.45,of fresh blueberries each day
2470.53,is the way that you can
get,sufficient anthocyanins
2473.21,"to at least shift your system,"
2475.77,or bias your brain towards these
enhanced,cognitive effects.
2478.93,"So we've got EPA fatty acids,"
2480.87,"we've got phosphatidylserine,"
2482.43,"we've got choline,"
2483.82,"we've got creatine, and"
we,have the anthocyanins.
2488.13,And the last item that I'd
like,to place in this list
2491.61,of food-derived things
2493.62,that can enhance brain
function,is glutamine.
2497.56,Glutamine is a very
interesting,amino acid.
2499.71,I've talked about
glutamine,on here before.
2501.98,"There's some evidence,"
"although,","somewhat scant,"
2505.11,there's some evidence that glutamine
2508.05,can enhance immune system function.
2509.87,"So people will supplement with glutamine,"
2511.53,or people can get glutamine from foods.
2513.87,Foods that contain a lot of glutamine
2515.24,are things like cottage cheese.
2516.69,There are also other sources of glutamine.
2519.11,"Glutamine is rich in protein rich foods,"
2521.73,"things like beef, chicken,"
"fish,","dairy products, eggs."
2524.27,"But also, for you non-animal food"
2528.45,"consuming people out there,"
2530.71,"vegetables, including"
"beans,","cabbage, once again,"
2533.73,"spinach, parsley, things of that sort."
2537.09,So those foods contain glutamine.
2539.52,"For people that supplement with glutamine,"
2541.42,"generally, they will take"
anywhere,"from a gram,"
2543.73,"as much as 10 grams, per day."
2546.15,Why would they want to do that?
2547.14,"Well, there's also some"
evidence,starting to emerge
2550.41,that glutamine can help
offset,"sugar cravings,"
2553.43,and I've talked about this
on,the podcast before.
2555.6,We're going to talk more about
2557.28,the basis for this a little bit later.
2559.3,"But in brief, we all"
have,neurons in our gut
2563.65,that sense the amino acid
"content,","the fat content,"
2566.79,and the sugar content of
the,"foods that we eat,"
2568.66,and signal in a subconscious
way,to our brain
2571.41,whether or not the
foods,that we are eating
2573.8,contain certain levels
of,certain amino acids.
2577.68,And so we actually have
glutamine-sensing,neurons in our gut
2582.26,"that actually have their little processes,"
2583.95,their little axons and
"dendrites,","as we call them,"
2586.84,in the mucosal lining of the gut.
2588.26,"They're not just sensing glutamine,"
2589.62,"but when they do sense glutamine,"
2591.13,"they respond, and they"
send,signals to the brain
2593.813,that are signals of
"satiation,",of satisfaction.
2597.5,"And in doing so, can offset"
some,of the sugar cravings
2600.16,that many people suffer from.
2602.11,"Now, here, we're talking about glutamine"
2603.52,for sake of enhancing cognitive function.
2606.01,"And this is interesting,"
2607.13,because it's been shown that
glutamine,supplementation
2610.43,can offset some of the
negative,effects on cognition
2614.52,caused by altitude and oxygen
deprivation,of other sorts.
2621.04,"Yeah, okay, well, that's kind of a strange"
2622.71,and unique situation.
2623.89,"If you're going up to altitude,"
2625.75,should you supplement with glutamine
2627.33,in order to be able to think more clearly?
2628.99,"Well, it appears that there's"
good,rationale for doing that.
2632.27,"But the reason I bring this up,"
2634.4,"assuming that most people, including me,"
2636.06,are not going up to high
altitudes,"very often,"
2639.79,is that it's been
well-established,"that apnea,"
2643.86,"failure to breathe properly during sleep,"
2646.23,"can contribute to age-related,"
2648.34,"and even non-age-related,"
cognitive,decline.
2650.9,"There are a lot of reasons for apneas,"
2653.92,ranging from obesity to
obstruction,"of the airways,"
2658.61,for other reasons.
2660.97,There are tremendous number
of,"underlying causes of apnea,"
2663.727,and it's something to be taken seriously.
2665.48,"I mean, heart attacks, all"
sorts,"of metabolic issues,"
2668.41,are caused by apnea.
2670.37,Apnea is a serious issue that
disrupts,"the depth of sleep,"
2673.7,and it's a serious
health,issue in general.
2676.3,"In any event,"
2677.33,apnea is associated with cognitive decline
2680.04,"and cognitive dysfunction,"
even,"in young people,"
2682.92,and it does appear that
glutamine,supplementation
2686.12,can offset some of the cognitive deficits
2689.23,that are associated with reduced
oxygenation,of the brain.
2692.57,If you'd like to learn more about
2693.91,"how apnea can negatively impact cognition,"
2697.8,there's an excellent paper
2698.95,that was published on this in 2018.
2700.8,"The first author is Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A."
2704.33,It should be easy to find.
2705.4,The title of the paper is
2706.233,"""Obstructive Sleep Apnea"
Severity,Affects Amyloid Burden
2710.11,"In Cognitively Normal Elderly""."
2712.18,This was a longitudinal study.
2713.81,Amyloid burden is a
correlate,of Alzheimer's
2717.56,and other forms of neurodegeneration
2719.73,and cognitive decline
associated,with memory deficits.
2722.47,So obstructive sleep apnea
[clears,"throat], excuse me,"
2725.71,is a very serious issue
2728.18,for which glutamine appears to be able to
2730.88,offset some of the
negative,symptomatology.
2733.92,"So how is it that glutamine,"
2735.72,either from food or
through,"supplementation,"
2738.46,can offset some of these
2740.22,so-called hypoxic effects
caused,by sleep apnea?
2742.89,Hypoxia being a lack
of,oxygen for the brain
2745.69,that relate to cognitive decline.
2747.54,It appears to have this positive impact
2751.09,by way of reducing inflammation.
2753.58,So if you want to look
more,deeply into the
2757.35,various biological pathways
2758.95,"and the supplementation regimes for this,"
2761.44,the paper that I think is
really,"spectacular is a paper,"
2764.7,"last author is Quaresma, Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A."
2770.06,That's Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.
2772.64,It's a review.
2773.517,"""The Possible Importance of"
2774.65,Glutamine Supplementation to Mood
2776.44,and Cognition in Hypoxia
from,"High Altitude""."
2779.55,And even though paper is about
2781.1,"high altitude-induced hypoxia,"
2783.24,it does seem to have direct relevance
2785.28,to the sorts of apnea that
are,related to Alzheimer's
2789.17,and other forms of cognitive decline.
2790.95,"Now, I've been taking"
glutamine,"as a supplement,"
2793.35,"gosh, since I was in college,"
2794.67,"mostly because I felt, either"
by,"superstition or by reality,"
2798.66,that it protected me from
various,"flus and colds,"
2803.38,"and things of that sort,"
2804.38,because of the purported
immune-enhancing,effects.
2808.57,"Again, those immune-enhancing effects"
2810.19,"have some data to support them, not a ton."
2813.22,"However, I got into the"
habit,"of taking glutamine,"
2815.34,and now that I've learned that glutamine
2817.62,seems to also have some
2818.99,"cognitive-enhancing effects, possibly,"
2821.31,it's a supplement that I continue to take.
2823.44,"I take very small amounts of it,"
2825.0,but I do take it on a regular basis.
2827.67,"So that, more or less, completes"
the,"list of things that,"
2831.13,"at least by my read of the literature,"
2833.97,are things that are
supported,"by at least three,"
2836.74,"and in some cases, as many"
as,"hundreds of studies,"
2839.81,"in various populations,"
2841.33,that have been explored
in,"mouse studies often,"
2844.51,but also in a number of human studies.
2847.25,"I want to emphasize again,"
2848.35,"that all of the things I listed out,"
2850.17,"whether or not it's EPAs,"
2851.62,"whether or not it's phosphatidylserine,"
2853.3,"whether or not it's choline,"
2854.27,whether or not it's the various compounds
2857.6,"that are in berries, et cetera,"
2858.94,all of those can be extracted from food.
2861.13,There is not any law that says
2863.24,that you have to get them
from,supplementation.
2865.04,Supplementation can help you get
2866.53,"to the very high levels of those things,"
2868.56,"if you want to work on the higher end,"
2870.38,if that's right for you.
2871.35,"Obviously, check with your"
doctor,before taking anything
2873.58,or removing anything from your
diet,or supplement regime.
2876.35,"But in general, you can get"
these,things from foods.
2880.773,"It's just so happens, that"
for,"some of these compounds,"
2884.7,the foods that they're
contained,"in, like fish,"
2886.31,"are not foods that I particularly enjoy,"
2889.04,and so I rely on [clears
"throat],","excuse me,"
2891.22,I rely on supplements in order to get
2893.72,sufficient levels for me.
2895.19,"But again, you can get"
these,levels from food.
2897.63,"And the reason I made this list,"
2900.55,the reason that I emphasize these things
2903.27,"in this particular order,"
2905.08,is that they support the
structure,of neurons.
2910.0,They support the structure of
the,other cells of the brain
2912.83,that make up our cognition
2913.977,"and that are important for our focus,"
2916.15,and our ability to remember
"things,",and so forth.
2918.92,And they are less so in the category
2921.01,of so-called modulatory effects.
2924.33,They will also have
modulatory,"effects on sleep,"
2927.33,"on inflammation,"
2928.163,or reducing inflammation
throughout,"the body,"
2929.97,"on cardiovascular function,"
2931.69,all of which I believe
are,positive affects.
2935.42,"At least what the literature tells us,"
2937.13,is that none of these compounds
2938.58,"are harming other systems of the body,"
2940.51,provided they are taken
at,reasonable levels.
2944.12,But everything in this
list,is directed towards
2948.25,"answering the question, what can I eat,"
2950.29,what can I ingest by way of
"food,","and/or food supplement,"
2954.04,that can support brain
function,in the short-term
2956.8,and in the long-term?
2957.75,So I hope you find that
list,beneficial for you.
2959.63,"If not for use, at"
least,for consideration.
2962.96,"So now, having talked"
about,some of the foods
2965.46,and micronutrients that are
beneficial,to our immediate
2968.13,"and long-term brain health,"
2970.52,"I'd like to shift gears somewhat,"
2972.06,and talk about why it is
2973.88,that we like the foods that we like.
2976.42,We've all heard before
2977.48,"that we are hardwired to pursue sugar,"
2981.56,"and to like fatty foods,"
2982.777,and that calorie-rich
foods,are attractive to us
2985.13,"for all sorts of reasons,"
2986.14,"you know, surviving famines,"
and,things of that sort.
2988.68,"And while that is true,"
2991.11,the actual mechanisms that underlie
2993.03,food seeking and food preference
2995.35,are far more interesting than that.
2997.29,There are basically three channels
2999.38,in our body and nervous system
3001.84,"by which we decide what foods to pursue,"
3004.52,"how much to eat, and"
whether,or not we will find
3007.02,"a particular food attractive,"
3009.76,whether or not we will
want,"to consume more of it,"
3012.19,"whether or not we want to avoid it,"
3014.39,"or whether or not it's just sort of so-so,"
3016.51,what I refer to as the
"yum,","yuck, or meh analysis."
3021.61,"And indeed, that's what"
our,nervous system is doing
3024.53,with respect to food.
3025.51,"It's trying to figure out whether or not,"
3027.73,"yum, I want more of this,"
3029.89,"yuck, I want to avoid this,"
3031.9,"or meh, it's so-so."
3033.87,"Now, while that may seem like"
3035.21,a overly simplified
version,of food seeking
3038.26,"and food preference,"
3039.67,it's actually not that far from the truth.
3042.1,It actually correctly captures
3044.82,much of the biology of food preference.
3048.28,So let's talk about what
these,three channels
3050.22,for food preference are.
3052.08,The first one is an obvious one.
3054.13,It's taste on the mouth.
3056.19,It is the sensation that we
have,of the foods that we eat
3059.43,"while we're chewing them,"
3060.91,"and those sensations,"
3062.38,which are literally just
"somatosensory,","touch sensations,"
3065.35,"you know, the palatability of food"
3068.75,as it relates to the consistency
of,"food, that's important."
3073.32,"And as you've all heard before,"
3075.07,we have sensors on our tongue
3076.6,and elsewhere in our mouth
3078.34,that detect the various
chemicals,"contained within food,"
3081.41,"and lead to the senses of taste,"
3084.6,"which we call bitter, sweet,"
"umami,","salty, and sour."
3088.24,"Now, most of us are familiar"
with,the sense of bitterness
3090.94,that comes from something
like,"a raw radish,"
3093.81,"sweet, which comes, obviously,"
3095.38,"from sugars of different kinds,"
3096.73,"fructose, glucose, et cetera,"
3098.94,"salty, salty,"
3101.21,"and sour, think lemon or"
lemon,"juice, for instance."
3106.07,And then I mentioned umami.
3108.04,The umami receptor is a
receptor,that responds
3111.55,to the savory taste of things.
3113.74,So that's what you might find in a really
3116.2,wonderfully rich tomato sauce.
3118.51,For those of you that
eat,"meat, and like meat,"
3121.5,"a really well cooked ,not"
necessarily,"well done,"
3124.95,"but properly cooked, I should say, steak,"
3128.58,if that's your thing.
3129.84,And umami is present in
both,"plant and animal foods,"
3133.55,and gives us that sensation of savoriness.
3136.36,It almost has a kind of little
bit,"of a briny taste to it,"
3139.82,or braised taste to it.
3141.45,"And indeed, brazing of meats"
and,brazing of vegetables
3145.16,is done specifically to
activate,that umami receptor.
3149.62,So we have those five basic tastes.
3151.69,Those are chemical sensors
on,"the tongue that,"
3154.97,"what we call, transduce those chemicals."
3157.48,"Those chemicals, literally, in"
food,"bind to those receptors,"
3160.86,"and it is transduced,"
3163.9,meaning the binding of those
chemicals,to the receptors
3166.89,is converted into an electrical signal
3169.0,that travels in from the tongue
3170.8,along what's called the gustatory nerve.
3172.98,"The gustatory nerve then synapses,"
3175.07,meaning it makes
connections,in our brainstem
3178.36,in the so-called nucleus
of,the solitary tract.
3180.97,There are other nuclei back there.
3182.62,Nuclei just aggregates of neurons.
3184.61,And then it sends information up to
3186.28,the so-called insular
"cortex,",to the insula.
3188.61,I want to highlight the
insula,"this episode,"
3191.68,because we are going
to,return to the insula
3194.72,again and again in this
"episode,",and later.
3197.5,The insular cortex is
a,incredible structure
3201.53,that we all have
3202.72,that mainly is concerned
with,"so-called interoception,"
3206.52,or our perception of what's
going,on inside our body.
3209.84,So it could be the amount
of,pressure in our gut
3211.5,because of how much food we've eaten.
3213.24,"It could be the acidity of our gut,"
3216.46,if we're having a little bit
of,"indigestion, for instance."
3218.86,"It can also be the case,"
3221.52,that neurons within the
insula,are paying attention
3223.61,"to how stressed you are,"
or,"how alert you are,"
3225.7,or how tired you are.
3226.8,So it's really an inward
focusing,structure.
3229.96,It focuses on how we feel internally.
3232.04,"And not surprisingly,"
3233.25,the taste system sends information
up,to the insular cortex
3238.21,"to give us a sense, literally,"
of,"what we've ingested,"
3242.71,whether or not what we're
tasting,tastes good or not.
3246.08,We will return to insular
cortex,in a few moments.
3249.13,"A very important thing to understand,"
3251.29,is that the neurons in
the,"areas of the cortex,"
3254.05,"your cortex and mine, that"
respond,to particular tastes
3257.94,are providing an internal representation
3261.98,of an external sense.
3264.88,What do I mean by that?
3265.85,I don't want to be at all abstract.
3267.81,"We take these foods,"
3268.81,we break them down in our
mouth,"by chewing them,"
3272.73,"or sucking on them,"
3273.563,"whatever it is the food happens to be,"
3275.95,"those chemicals bind to those receptors,"
3277.65,and electrical signals
are,"sent into the brain,"
3280.01,"but they are just electrical signals,"
3281.67,just like notes being played
on,the keys of a piano.
3285.04,There's no unique signature
for,salty or sweet.
3288.09,It is the relative activation
of,one set of neurons
3293.16,"that was activated by sweet,"
3294.93,or another set of neurons
that,was activated by umami.
3297.57,It's that relative activation
3299.51,"traveling into the brain in,"
"essentially,","the same form,"
3304.09,the same electrical signals.
3305.55,"This is really incredible, right?"
3306.61,Electrical signals are
sent,"into the brain,"
3307.99,"and you say, aha, that's"
sweet,"and I want more of it,"
3311.0,"or that's bitter, or I want less of it,"
3312.55,"or that's umami flavored,"
3313.79,"and I really, really like that,"
3315.41,"really like savory foods, as I happen to."
3319.21,That should immediately
strike,"you as incredible,"
3322.0,because it means that your representation
3324.04,of what you want more of or
less,of is electrical in nature.
3327.31,"And to really tamp this issue down,"
3331.09,studies that were done by
Charles,"Zuker, Z-U-K-E-R..."
3336.03,He's a absolutely
phenomenal,neuroscientist
3340.21,at Columbia University in New York.
3343.13,Studies done by the Zuker
Lab,"have shown that,"
3347.04,"first of all, they could identify"
the,neurons in the cortex
3351.44,deep in the brain that
respond,to a sweet taste
3354.42,or to a bitter taste.
3355.4,"It turns out, they are non-overlapping"
3356.9,populations of neurons.
3358.51,"And then using some molecular tricks,"
3361.07,they were able to either silence
3363.66,or activate the neurons
"that,","for instance,"
3366.3,respond to sweet.
3369.45,"When they do this,"
3370.283,they see incredible
consequences,on perception
3374.35,"that, indeed, occur in your brain,"
3376.95,"and my brain as well, all the time"
3378.73,without these kind of manipulations.
3380.22,Here's the experiment.
3382.27,They have a subject drink
water,"that contains sugar,"
3387.49,or drink water that
contains,"a salty substance,"
3389.67,or drink water that contains
3390.92,"a bitter substance, for instance."
3392.67,"Okay, I'm sort of paraphrasing"
a,large amount of work.
3396.09,They identify the neurons
that,respond to sweet tastes.
3401.54,"They see, as many researchers have seen,"
3404.78,that subjects prefer sweet
taste,"to other tastes,"
3407.95,"and certainly, sweet tastes to bitter,"
3409.52,or sweet tastes to
"nothing,",so to plain water.
3413.33,"And then they go in,"
3414.86,and they are able to
selectively,silence the neurons
3417.69,that represent sweet.
3421.36,"And when they do that,"
3422.29,they eliminate the preference
for,that sweet taste.
3427.26,"Now, that might seem obvious,"
3428.61,"the neurons respond to sweet,"
3429.68,"and you silence those neurons,"
3431.7,they no longer seek out sweet.
3434.64,But that should strike
"you,","also, as incredible,"
3437.78,because they're not actually changing
3439.3,what's happening on the tongue
3440.53,or in the deeper layers of the brain.
3443.3,"Conversely, they can have"
subjects,drink bitter water
3447.64,"or plain water while activating,"
3450.78,"selectively activating, the"
neurons,that respond to sweet.
3454.19,"And what they find,"
3455.4,is that then subjects will
actively,prefer bitter
3460.7,or plain water to actual
"preferences,",such as sweet.
3466.41,"So what this means is that,"
3468.21,your perception of what
you,"like is a central,"
3471.45,"meaning deep within the brain, phenomenon."
3474.52,It's not about how things
taste,on your mouth.
3477.53,"Now, of course, under normal conditions,"
3479.24,where there aren't these
3480.073,"experimental manipulations being done,"
3482.36,those things are positively correlated.
3484.49,Sweet tastes trigger the activation
3486.34,"of sweet neurons, for instance."
3488.18,Neurons in the mouth
that,"respond to umami,"
3490.8,trigger the activation
of,neurons in the brain
3492.92,"that respond to umami, and so forth."
3495.77,So they're correlated in a way
3497.51,that makes you seek out
the,"things that you like,"
3500.02,and avoid the things that you don't like.
3502.26,"But as we'll see in a few minutes,"
3504.76,"turns out, that that is"
not,a direct relationship
3508.1,that is hardwired.
3509.52,You can actually uncouple
3511.54,the preference for a particular taste
3513.87,with the reward systems in the brain
3516.43,"in a way that, for instance,"
3518.4,"would allow you to eat,"
3520.94,"or I should use myself as an example,"
3522.39,'cause I don't particularly like fish.
3523.83,I've had a few meals that include a fish
3526.24,"that were pretty good,"
3527.51,but none of them were memorable
3529.23,"in the kind of positive way,"
3530.3,that like some other events
in,my life were memorable.
3534.327,"But by way of these circuitries,"
3535.85,"and the way they link up with one another,"
3537.3,it's actually possible to
rewire,one's sense of taste
3541.38,and preference for particular foods.
3543.23,"If this is seeming at all vague to you,"
3544.83,"just hang in with me a little bit longer,"
3547.25,because I will provide you
with,"the information, tools,"
3549.24,and resources with which
to,navigate this process.
3553.13,But the most important
thing,"to understand is that,"
3556.82,"like with our hearing,"
3559.01,"like with vision,"
3561.47,"like with smell,"
3563.92,taste is an internal representation
3567.69,that has particular goals for you.
3571.83,Your sense of what tastes good
3573.17,is related to particular things
3574.87,"that are occurring in your brain and body,"
3576.55,and that are likely to give your brain
3578.74,and body the things that it needs.
3581.53,It is not simply a matter of
3583.23,"what you, quote/unquote, ""like"","
3584.56,"or what tastes good, or"
what,doesn't taste good.
3587.19,Let me give you a
relatively,simple example
3590.15,of how your body and your brain are acting
3593.26,in a coordinated way
3594.85,"to make you prefer certain foods,"
3595.754,"and indeed, to pursue certain foods more."
3600.38,"As I just mentioned, you"
have,neurons on your tongue
3602.54,that respond to different tastes.
3604.29,"But, of course, your digestive"
tract,"isn't just your tongue,"
3606.93,it's also your throat.
3607.93,"It goes all the way down to your stomach,"
3609.91,"and, of course, your intestines."
3612.14,It's a long tube of digestion.
3614.74,All along that tube there are neurons.
3617.69,Some of the neurons are responding to
3620.2,the mechanical size of
3623.4,whatever portion of the
digestive,tract it happens to be.
3625.69,"So for instance, how distended,"
or,"empty, or full, rather,"
3628.75,"it doesn't have to be distended,"
3630.634,"it depends on how much you ate,"
3631.61,but how full or empty
your,"gut happens to be,"
3634.86,whether or not something you
just,"ate is temperature hot,"
3638.42,"you know, is hot in the"
sense,"of hot to the touch,"
3641.12,"or whether or not it's spicy hot,"
3642.98,"whether or not it's soothing,"
3644.25,whether or not it's
kind,"of hard to swallow,"
3646.69,this kind of thing.
3647.6,So you have neurons all along your gut
3649.57,that are responding to the mechanics
3651.51,"related to food and digestion,"
3653.05,and that are related to the
chemistry,of food and digestion.
3657.02,"There's a population of neurons,"
3659.61,"nerve cells in your gut,"
3661.43,that are exquisitely
tuned,to the chemistry
3664.21,of whatever it is in your gut.
3666.21,And these are neurons
called,neuropod cells.
3669.6,"They were discovered many, many years ago,"
3672.51,but really defined with
3674.6,and classified with modern tools
3677.71,by Diego Bohorquez.
3679.17,I hope I'm pronouncing
your,name correctly.
3680.87,"Diego, we've spoken many times,"
3682.51,but I can't ever seem to quite capture
3684.16,the proper pronunciation just right.
3686.28,"But Diego Bohorquez at Duke University,"
3690.66,who discovered that these cells
3693.78,"reside within the gut,"
3695.47,"and place little processes,"
3697.05,"they're little axons and dendrites,"
3699.63,within the mucosal lining of the gut.
3703.1,"And there, they are paying attention to,"
3705.84,"meaning they respond to,"
3708.6,"amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids."
3712.8,"So as your food is digested,"
3715.03,"as food lands within your gut,"
3717.22,neurons there are sensing what
types,"of foods are available,"
3720.98,and what types of things
are,making their way
3724.501,through the gut environment.
3726.05,"Now, those neurons aren't"
actually,taking those foods
3728.277,and doing much with them.
3729.43,"What they're doing, is they're essentially"
3732.69,surveying what qualities
of,food are there.
3736.67,And these particular neurons
3738.26,"that Diego and his group discovered,"
3741.01,send electrical signals up into the brain
3744.68,through a little passage that
we,call the nodose ganglion.
3747.68,The nodose ganglion is
a,cluster of neurons
3750.28,that then send up their
own,"process into the brain,"
3753.71,"and trigger the release of dopamine,"
3755.35,which is a molecule that
inspires,"motivation, reward,"
3760.2,and more seeking for whatever
it,is led to their activation.
3765.1,"These are super interesting neurons,"
3766.87,"because what they're essentially doing,"
3768.98,is they are providing
a,subconscious signal
3773.35,about the quality of the
food,"that you're eating,"
3775.7,"what it contains,"
3776.95,and then triggering the release
3778.55,"of a molecule within your brain, dopamine,"
3781.42,that leads you to go
seek,more of those foods.
3785.15,"Now, this has profound"
impact,on a number of things.
3789.94,"First of all,"
3791.52,there's the consideration
of,so-called hidden sugars.
3794.37,"Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a"
pediatric,endocrinologist
3797.46,at University of
"California,","San Francisco,"
3799.78,has been among the most
prominent,researchers
3803.22,to talk about the fact
3804.23,that there are these so-called
hidden,sugars in foods.
3806.46,"Now, these are not just sugars,"
3807.82,"that they sneak in just to be sneaky,"
3810.43,these are sugars that
are,literally snuck in
3812.89,in a way that you can't taste them.
3815.52,That's why they're called hidden sugars.
3817.17,It's not that they just
put,them in there for fun.
3819.2,These are sugars that are
placed,into processed foods
3822.78,that are designed to trigger activation
3825.01,of these mechanisms
3826.89,to lead you to want to
eat,"more of these foods,"
3830.11,but not because they necessarily
taste,"sweet or delicious,"
3834.3,but because they are activating
3836.29,these subconscious mechanisms
3837.58,that are driving you to
pursue,more of these foods.
3840.1,"It sounds like a very diabolical strategy,"
3842.0,"and indeed, it is somewhat"
of,a diabolical strategy.
3845.82,"However, these neurons are also involved"
3848.47,in signaling to your
brain,"when, for instance,"
3850.63,you are eating a food that is
rich,"in omega-3 fatty acids,"
3855.51,the fatty acids that we
were,talking about earlier.
3857.86,So why is it that you don't crave salmon?
3859.87,Why is it that I don't sit around
3861.3,daydreaming about mackerel?
3863.03,"Well, because there's also the influence"
3864.87,of the actual taste on the mouth.
3866.63,"Under normal conditions,"
3867.66,it's a combination of the taste
of,"the thing on the mouth,"
3870.45,plus the subconscious
signaling,from the gut.
3873.09,And while this isn't a
discussion,"about gut microbiome,"
3877.31,"I should just mention,"
that,it's very clear
3880.17,that having a healthy gut microbiome
3883.57,allows these neurons to function in a way
3886.32,that serves our seeking of
healthy,foods in positive ways.
3890.89,And without getting into a
lot,"of detail about this,"
3893.55,the best way to ensure
a,healthy gut microbiome
3896.1,that I am aware of
3897.88,is not necessarily
3899.59,to take supplemental
prebiotics,or probiotics.
3903.28,There are actually some reasons why
3904.39,you might not want to do that.
3906.24,"But rather, to ingest two to four servings"
3908.51,of fermented foods that
are,low in sugar each day.
3912.29,There is a recent study published in Cell
3914.1,showing that the ingestion
of,"fermented foods,"
3916.72,"two to four servings each day,"
3920.45,can enhance the quality of
the,mucosal lining of the gut
3924.92,that allows certain gut
microbiota,"to flourish,"
3928.42,and the gut microbiota
that,are not good for us
3931.14,"to not flourish,"
3931.973,'cause that's the environment
that,they settle down into.
3933.9,This is work that was carried out
3935.45,"by my colleagues, Justin Sonnenburg,"
3938.33,which is in the laboratory
upstairs,"from me,"
3940.97,"as well as Chris Gardner,"
and,others at Stanford.
3944.77,They are certainly not the only
researchers,exploring this.
3946.94,"But it does appear,"
3948.07,that two to four servings of
3951.04,"fermented foods each day,"
3952.28,so these would be things
like,"natto, sauerkraut,"
3955.25,"low sugar fermented foods, is"
great,for the gut microbiome.
3959.41,"And separate studies, not their study,"
3961.48,but separate studies have shown
3962.61,that the correct gut microbiome conditions
3965.61,allow these neurons
that,signal to the brain
3967.85,"to signal the right, at the right times,"
3970.35,and in the right ways to
promote,healthy food seeking.
3973.71,Many people opt to supplement
with,capsule form probiotics.
3978.5,There are some data that suggests
3981.01,that maybe those don't
contain,the correct prebiotics
3984.38,and probiotics for setting the correct
3986.99,gut microbiota conditions.
3988.93,That's a little bit of
a,controversial issue.
3991.7,"Nonetheless, getting"
probiotics,from fermented foods
3996.32,is probably the simplest and
most,straightforward way.
3998.48,It's also the way that we
evolved,"to do that over many,"
4001.69,"at least hundreds, and"
"probably,","thousands,"
4003.29,or even tens or hundreds
of,"thousands of years,"
4005.17,people have been
ingesting,"fermented foods,"
4007.36,"not just for their tastes,"
4008.23,but for their health benefits as well.
4010.55,So now I've mentioned two
of,the three mechanisms
4013.47,by which we prefer certain foods.
4015.94,One is from the actual taste
that,"we're familiar with,"
4018.757,"the taste on our tongue, and in our mouth,"
4020.82,in the sensations that make
us,"go mmm, or ugh, or eh,"
4025.3,"the yum, yuk, meh responses,"
as,I referred to them earlier.
4028.38,And then there's this
subconscious,signaling
4030.38,coming from the gut
4031.213,that's really based on the
nutrient,content of the foods.
4035.78,"There's a third pathway,"
4037.55,which is the learned association
of,a particular taste
4041.57,with the particular quality
or,value that a food has.
4045.96,And this is where things
get,"really interesting,"
4049.04,and where there's
actually,a leverage point
4051.19,for you to rewire
4053.2,"what it is that you find tasty,"
4055.546,and that you want to seek more of.
4057.68,The work I'd like to talk about next
4059.06,"has been carried out in mouse models,"
4061.5,and has been carried out in
parallel,experiments in humans.
4066.32,"This is largely, not exclusively,"
4068.39,but largely the work of Ivan
de,Araujo and Dana Small.
4075.13,Ivan de Araujo is at Mount
Sinai,School of Medicine.
4078.74,And Dana Small is at Yale.
4080.93,"And they, and others in their field,"
4082.81,have done incredible experiments
4084.89,"exploring how taste and food value,"
4088.32,"the nutritional value of food,"
4090.36,and the impact of that food
on,metabolism in the brain
4095.16,"drives our food choices,"
4097.02,and allows us to change our
food,choices for the better.
4100.27,Their groups have done
some,really amazing studies
4103.19,involving ingestion of
a,particular substance
4106.84,"that either contains sugar,"
4109.94,"and thereby, can elevate"
"glucose,","blood sugar, or not."
4113.92,"And varying, meaning"
changing,the taste associated
4118.46,with that ingestion of sugar.
4121.17,So let me just give you a simple example
4123.3,"where they have subjects,"
4125.82,these could be mice or
these,"could be humans,"
4127.46,"'cause they've done both sets of studies,"
4130.33,drink sweet water as an alternative
4134.79,or a choice to non-sweetened
"water,","or bitter water,"
4138.4,or some other flavor.
4139.64,"And what they find, is that"
mice,and humans will prefer
4143.04,to consume the sweet beverage.
4145.1,"Now, it's not always sweet water."
4146.53,"Mice like sweet water,"
4147.54,"but humans will prefer,"
for,"instance, a milkshake,"
4151.34,a fatty sweet drink.
4155.4,"They'll consume more of that,"
4156.74,"and not surprisingly,"
4158.14,dopamine levels in the brain
increase,in response to that.
4163.47,So the taste and the nutrient content
4166.67,of what it is that they're
ingesting,are aligned.
4169.67,They are matched.
4172.1,They've also done experiments
where,"they have no taste,"
4176.35,but subjects are being infused with sugar
4179.26,directly into the gut.
4181.23,"And not surprisingly,"
4183.08,based on everything I've
told,"you up until now,"
4186.14,subjects will pursue more of that thing
4188.98,"relative to some other taste,"
4191.65,"either neutral or negative taste,"
4194.33,because that sugar in the gut
4196.49,is triggering the activation
4197.68,"of the neurons I mentioned earlier,"
4198.93,which is signaling to the brain
4200.1,to pursue more of that thing.
4201.97,So this tells us something important.
4203.51,"It tells us that we are driven,"
4206.11,meaning we have mechanisms in our brain
4208.22,that make us motivated to pursue
4210.16,more of what brings both
a,"taste of sweetness,"
4213.4,but also that brings actual changes
4215.71,"in blood glucose levels up, okay?"
4218.76,So we are motivated to eat sweet things
4220.61,"not just because they taste good,"
4222.08,but because they change
our,blood sugar level.
4224.87,They increase our blood sugar level.
4226.97,"This is important,"
4227.91,because it needn't be the case.
4229.49,It could have been that we were just wired
4231.45,to pursue things that taste good.
4234.34,"But what this tells us,"
4235.22,is that we are actually
wired,to pursue things
4238.3,"that increase our blood glucose,"
4241.47,so much so that when the small lab...
4246.72,It's not a small lab.
4247.553,It's actually a big lab.
4248.386,"But when Dana Small's lab,"
and/or,"Ivan de Araujo's lab,"
4252.51,have done experiments
4254.67,where they use a compound
called,"2-deoxyglucose,"
4258.32,this is a compound that
4260.32,can prevent glucose from
being,metabolized by neurons.
4263.99,"So blood glucose is going up,"
4265.27,but neurons can't use it.
4267.0,"What they find, is that the reinforcing"
4269.08,or the rewarding properties of a food
4271.53,or taste are eliminated.
4274.35,"Put simply, it is not"
sufficient,for a food
4277.67,to taste good consciously.
4280.37,It is not sufficient for a
food,to increase blood sugar.
4284.73,"You need blood sugar to go up,"
4287.35,and that blood sugar glucose
4289.72,"has to be utilized by the neurons,"
4292.89,even if it's not associated
with,a good taste.
4296.4,"And to make it even simpler,"
4298.08,"if this isn't sinking in,"
4299.9,this should make it very clear.
4301.61,"What your brain,"
4303.16,"meaning, what you are seeking"
when,"you eat, is not taste,"
4307.36,"is not dopamine,"
4309.2,is not even a rise in blood glucose.
4311.65,"What you're seeking, even"
though,"you don't realize it,"
4314.24,"because it's subconscious,"
4316.11,is you are seeking things
that,allow your neurons
4318.74,to be metabolically active.
4320.92,And this is fundamentally important
4323.66,"for understanding why you eat,"
4326.07,"why you eat particular foods,"
4328.99,and how you can change your
relationship,to those foods.
4331.89,"Now, earlier, I referred to circuits"
4334.07,that are wired for a particular outcome.
4336.87,"And in biology, and in"
"particular,","neuroscience,"
4339.14,we refer to things that
are,"either hard-wired,"
4342.04,"meaning immutable, and"
"unchangeable,",or soft-wired.
4346.49,A good example of soft-wiring would be
4348.32,the areas of your brain that
are,responsible for speech
4351.2,"and language are always, more or less,"
4355.95,in the same place in your brain
and,everyone else's brain.
4359.5,"However, they are not"
hard-wired,"to speak French,"
4363.45,"or to speak English, or to speak Chinese,"
4365.25,"or to speak German,"
4366.8,"because depending on where you were born,"
4368.63,"and the parents that you're born to,"
4370.64,you need to be able to speak one
4372.002,or maybe even more languages.
4374.83,"The taste system,"
4376.04,and this general system of
seeking,"particular foods,"
4379.32,similarly is hard-wired to obtain
4382.84,certain types of nutrients.
4384.21,It tends to like sweet things.
4385.73,"Most children naturally like sweet things,"
4387.55,some more than others.
4388.89,"But naturally, most people"
from,childhood onward
4392.5,don't particularly crave
very,bitter substances.
4395.14,"Maybe mildly bitter, but not very bitter."
4397.38,"So there's some hard-wiring of preference,"
4399.67,but there's also some
soft-wiring,in the system
4402.3,that allows it to change.
4405.18,The groups I mentioned earlier
4406.22,have done some really
beautiful,experiments
4408.22,looking at how artificial sweeteners
4411.12,interact with the actual
sweet,sensing system.
4414.48,And this gets right down
to,a number of issues.
4417.11,"First of all, it gets to the issue of"
4419.06,how we can rewire our taste system
4421.707,in ways that serve us
for,better or for worse.
4424.94,"Second of all, it gets"
right,down to the issue
4427.52,of whether or not artificial sweeteners
4429.62,are good for us or bad for us.
4431.51,"And indeed, as of just this last year,"
4434.72,"we know an answer to that question,"
4438.0,"and turns out, it depends."
4440.06,And I will tell you in a few minutes
4442.5,when it is okay to ingest
artificial,"sweeteners,"
4446.16,and when it is very detrimental
4448.0,to ingest artificial
sweeteners,of any kind.
4451.33,"Regardless, I'm not going"
to,"name off brand names,"
4453.13,but there are different forms of these
4454.44,artificial sweeteners nowadays.
4456.99,And there are various forms
4458.6,of non-caloric plant-based sweeteners
4461.24,for which the same information
4462.67,that I'm about to tell you applies.
4464.96,Okay.
4466.03,So the experiments that were done
4467.9,beautifully illustrate that
you,seek out particular foods
4471.37,"because of the way they taste,"
4473.3,because of their impact
on,"blood glucose levels,"
4476.38,but also on their impact
on,"the dopamine system,"
4480.61,even if your blood glucose
levels,don't change.
4483.24,So here's the experiment.
4485.053,One group of subjects
is,given a sweet taste
4487.87,of a substance that also raises
4489.46,"blood glucose levels, blood sugar,"
4491.33,"and dopamine goes up, not surprisingly."
4494.78,"The second condition,"
4496.0,separate subjects consume
an,artificial sweetener
4499.29,or a non-caloric sweetener.
4501.23,It is not preferred much
over,"other substances,"
4504.61,"but it is sweet, so"
it's,preferred somewhat.
4507.6,And it does not cause an
increase,"in blood glucose levels,"
4511.7,"and not surprisingly,"
dopamine,levels don't go up.
4515.4,"So initially, we don't tend to like"
4517.39,artificial sweeteners that much.
4518.71,That's the simple way of putting it.
4520.09,"However, if subjects continue"
4522.82,"to ingest artificial sweeteners,"
4525.57,even though there's no increase
in,"blood glucose level,"
4527.69,"and therefore, no increase"
in,"brain metabolism,"
4531.4,dopamine levels eventually start to rise.
4534.25,And when those dopamine levels
eventually,"start to rise,"
4537.56,you've essentially conditioned
4538.78,or reinforced that artificial
or,"non-caloric sweetener,"
4543.87,and then subjects start
to,"consume more of it,"
4545.88,and they actually get a
dopamine,increase from it.
4549.58,So that's interesting.
4550.413,"It says that, consuming more"
of,"these artificial sweeteners,"
4552.82,or consuming them for a
longer,"period of time,"
4555.15,"can start to tap into the dopamine system,"
4557.02,and lead us to seek out
4558.15,or consume more of these
artificial,sweeteners.
4559.91,Many people are probably
familiar,"with this,"
4562.05,"because we tend to,"
4564.68,"or I should say, people report,"
4566.1,that when they ingest these
artificial,"sweeteners,"
4568.12,"at first, they don't taste very good,"
4569.31,"but then, over time, they"
seem,"kind of tolerable,"
4571.44,"and then maybe even pleasureful,"
4572.397,"and then some people feel, quote/unquote,"
4574.037,"""addicted"" to various diet"
"sodas,",and things of that sort.
4578.01,"Now, there's another condition"
that's,"been explored,"
4581.93,and that's the really
interesting,"condition,"
4583.86,and it's the condition where
an,artificial sweetener
4586.74,is paired with a substance
that,"can increase blood sugar,"
4591.27,"but not because it tastes sugary,"
4593.75,like a normal sweet substance.
4595.0,"So now, there's an artificial sweetener"
4597.81,that's coupled with an actual
increase,in blood glucose.
4602.12,The natural world scenario
where,this would happen
4605.18,would be drinking a diet soda
which,"contains no calories,"
4608.55,"and therefore, would not"
increase,"blood glucose,"
4610.26,"but is sweet, with a food"
that,increases blood glucose.
4615.48,"And when that happens,"
4617.37,"what you're essentially doing,"
4618.33,is tapping into the dopamine system.
4620.06,This non-caloric sweet
taste,"is paired with it,"
4624.03,and there's an increase
in,neuron metabolism.
4627.58,So you have all of the
components,for reinforcement.
4630.49,"And as a consequence,"
4632.43,you get in a sort of
Pavlovian,"conditioning way,"
4635.268,"a situation where, later,"
4637.81,"when you ingest that artificial sweetener,"
4640.64,you actually get not only
the,"increase in dopamine,"
4643.79,but you get alterations
in,blood sugar management.
4647.29,"Now, blood sugar cannot go up"
4649.48,if you don't ingest something
that,makes blood sugar go up.
4652.63,So it's not as if you
ingest,artificial sweetener
4655.19,with some food that
contains,"calories or sugar,"
4658.42,"and then later, you remove the food,"
4660.43,"and you just drink the soda,"
4661.82,and your blood glucose goes up.
4664.33,"Rather, it's a much worse situation."
4670.07,I'll make this in the
natural,world context.
4671.8,"If you ingest an artificial sweetener,"
4673.44,"say, drink diet soda while consuming foods"
4676.93,"that increase blood glucose,"
4679.65,"then later, even if you"
just,"drink the diet soda,"
4684.15,it's been shown that you
secrete,"much more insulin,"
4688.1,"the hormone that regulates blood glucose,"
4690.97,in response to that diet soda.
4693.14,Studies have been done
in,both adult humans
4696.11,and in human children.
4697.66,"In general, when we say children,"
4698.94,"we mean human children,"
4699.773,but just to be very clear
what,we're talking about.
4702.46,Exploring consuming diet
soda,"with or without food,"
4705.7,"then later, consuming just the diet soda."
4708.82,"And what they found was,"
4709.96,having previously consumed
diet,"soda with food,"
4713.02,"and then later, only"
consuming,"the diet soda,"
4716.53,"of course, there isn't an"
increase,"in blood glucose,"
4718.92,because they're not
bringing,in any calories
4720.62,"when they just drink the diet soda,"
4722.48,but there is a significant
increase,"in insulin release,"
4726.98,"and that is serious in a terrible way,"
4730.38,"because increased release of insulin,"
4732.33,"and so-called insulin sensitivity,"
4734.29,is the basis for type 2 diabetes.
4736.81,"So much so, that in the"
study,"with the children,"
4740.32,consuming non-caloric
beverages,"in this way,"
4745.17,"first with food, and then on their own,"
4747.08,led to increases in insulin
that,"made them pre-diabetic,"
4750.17,and they actually had to halt the study.
4752.32,"So I want to zoom out from this,"
4754.427,and just really illustrate
the,"major findings,"
4756.82,and then talk about
how,this can be applied
4758.93,in the positive sense.
4759.78,I also want to mention what this means
4761.38,in terms of your consumption
4762.97,of artificial sweeteners of any kind.
4765.49,"So first of all,"
4766.43,the direct takeaway about
artificial,sweeteners.
4769.92,Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you.
4772.62,I'm not going to say that.
4774.28,"What I am going to say,"
4775.36,is that whether or not
you,"ingest them alone,"
4777.38,or you ingest them in
combination,"with food,"
4780.76,or as part of foods that
raise,"blood glucose,"
4784.21,is vitally important for
your,insulin management.
4787.02,And the simple extractor
tool,"from this is,"
4790.8,if you are going to consume
artificial,"sweeteners,"
4793.204,it's very likely best to consume those
4796.51,away from any food that
raises,blood glucose levels.
4800.66,So if you're going to enjoy
diet,"soda, be my guest,"
4804.22,"but do it not while consuming food,"
4807.18,"in particular, foods"
that,raise blood glucose.
4809.46,"Because what these studies show,"
4811.21,"and I will provide references for these,"
4813.12,is that they can vastly disrupt
4816.8,blood sugar management by way of
4818.56,"the insulin glucose system, okay?"
4820.69,"And actually, I'll just"
give,you the reference now.
4822.83,This is a paper from Dana Small's lab.
4825.46,The first author is
"Dalenburg,",D-A-L-E-N-B-U-R-G.
4830.13,And the title of the paper is
4831.547,"""Short-term Consumption of Sucralose With,"
4833.447,"nut Not Without Carbohydrate,"
4834.94,Impairs Neural and Metabolic Sensitivity
4837.38,"to Sugar in Humans""."
4839.74,This is a paper published
in,"""Cell Metabolism"""
4841.59,in March of 2020.
4842.81,I think it's a very important paper.
4845.0,And similar findings have
been,"addressed in mice,"
4848.45,and in other studies.
4849.283,"And now, because of this paper,"
4850.58,there's now a bunch of other
groups,working on this issue.
4854.97,There's some evidence previously
published,"in ""Nature"","
4858.61,an excellent top-tier journal.
4860.86,Sort of among the Superbowl
of,"top three journals,"
4863.74,"being ""Nature"", ""Science"", and ""Cell""."
4865.06,A paper published in
Nature,a few years back
4867.87,showing that particular
artificial,sweeteners
4871.0,"can disrupt the gut microbiome,"
4872.76,and have deleterious health effects.
4875.69,"That result, I think, stands,"
4877.19,"although, there are some results"
4878.45,"that may not agree with that,"
4881.03,depending on whether or not
the,artificial sweetener
4882.84,"is saccharin, or sucralose,"
or,"aspartame, or stevia."
4886.06,That's the gut microbiome.
4887.66,But what we are talking about here
4889.91,is independent of the form of artificial
4892.32,"or non-caloric sweetener,"
4893.33,because it has everything to do with
4894.56,whether or not there is a match
4895.83,"or a mismatch between the perceived taste,"
4899.33,and the effect of the thing
that,you are consuming
4902.71,on blood sugar and metabolism.
4905.29,"So the first takeaway from this is,"
4908.96,if you're going to consume
artificial,"sweeteners,"
4911.8,it's really important that you do that
4913.53,not in conjunction with foods
that,increase blood glucose.
4917.7,"Second of all, it points to the fact,"
4920.18,"that the foods that we prefer,"
4922.98,"and the activation of the dopamine system,"
4926.89,"both through the gut,"
4928.7,"and at the level of conscious taste,"
4931.35,"in other words, what we"
"like,",is very plastic.
4935.03,"It's mutable, and we can change it."
4937.49,How can we change it?
4938.66,"Well, earlier, I mentioned"
a,structure in the brain
4942.34,"called the insula,"
4943.49,this incredible structure that's
involved,"in interoception,"
4946.29,and interoception of all kinds.
4948.15,"In fact, just as an aside,"
4950.33,"a year or so ago,"
4951.95,my lab published a paper showing that
4954.35,activity within certain
compartments,of the insula
4959.57,of humans is responding to
4962.42,a heightened state of anxiety in the body.
4964.2,It can respond to changes
in,"our respiration,"
4966.64,changes in our heart rate.
4967.75,So this is...
4968.583,"Again, it's a readout"
of,"our internal state,"
4971.2,"not just of taste,"
4972.1,"but of many, many different"
aspects,of the mechanics
4975.6,and chemistry of our internal
milieu,within our body.
4980.33,All of the work that I
was,describing previously
4983.84,has also been addressed
at,the neural level.
4986.35,And using a broad brush
to,"explain these results,"
4989.7,"what we can say is,"
4992.15,"when there is dopamine increase,"
4996.19,one sees activation of the
so-called,"nucleus accumbens,"
4999.06,which is part of the so-called
mesolimbic,reward pathway.
5002.41,If you'd like to learn more about
5003.243,"the mesolimbic reward pathway,"
and,dopamine in general
5007.44,"in humans and in animal studies,"
5008.97,and all the various incredible
5012.98,and challenging things that
dopamine,"can do for us,"
5015.98,there's a episode all about
dopamine,that you can look up.
5018.99,It's easy to find at Hubermanlab.com.
5021.75,The increases in dopamine
associated,with sweet taste
5025.74,and/or blood glucose
elevating,"foods and drinks,"
5030.9,cause activation of the nucleus accumbens.
5032.76,That's not surprising.
5034.57,Also in the circuit
5035.92,is activation of the
so-called,arcuate nuclei
5038.93,within the hypothalamus.
5039.9,These are areas of the hypothalamus
5041.56,"that respond to hormones from the body,"
5043.47,and respond to hormones and
neuropeptides,"in the brain,"
5046.96,"as well as neural signals in the brain,"
5049.22,to drive us to eat
"more,",or to stop eating.
5052.39,"So it's hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens."
5054.87,These are sort of the...
5056.08,Hypothalamus and the arcuate
being,"the motivating to eat,"
5060.48,or motivating to stop eating.
5062.78,Both sets of neurons are contained there.
5065.38,There are other areas like the
lateral,hypothalamus as well.
5067.51,But hypothalamus is
sort,of the accelerator
5069.21,and the break on eating.
5070.33,And then the nucleus accumbens
5072.32,and dopamine release can be thought of
5074.28,"as kind of a nitro boost, if"
you,"will, like the kids say."
5078.59,Do the kids say that anymore?
5079.47,"Anyway, a nitro boost to"
increase,what we call the gain
5083.93,or the volume of how much you
want,"more of something, okay?"
5087.84,"When dopamine is present,"
5089.01,it's this kind of generic signal
5090.88,to go seek out more of
whatever,caused that release.
5094.43,And then there's the insula.
5095.94,"This very thoughtful, rational..."
5098.22,Not really.
5099.053,It's not thinking.
5099.886,It's a brain area.
5100.719,"You're thinking, but it's part"
of,the areas of your brain
5103.303,that are interpreting what's
going,on in your body.
5105.4,Whether or not you feel good or not good.
5106.93,Whether or not you feel
"anxious,","excited, or fearful."
5111.72,It's integrating all that information.
5114.33,And fed into this entire circuit as well
5118.37,are the inputs from
your,"prefrontal cortex,"
5120.56,"which is your thinking, rational,"
5123.08,"neuronal structure, if you will,"
5125.81,"informing you, for instance,"
5127.72,"ah, well, I don't really"
like,"salmon very much,"
5131.61,"or I'm not so crazy about kale,"
5134.12,"but it has omega-3s,"
5136.98,or it's rich in these
polyphenols,that are good for me.
5141.55,And if one decides that they
are,"going to eat these things,"
5146.22,"not just because they are good for them,"
5148.35,"but believe it or not,"
5150.11,if one takes the perception
5152.88,or adopts the perception that
they,"are both good for you,"
5156.1,"and that in being good for you,"
5159.59,"they are good for your brain metabolism,"
5161.45,"and that you desire to be healthy,"
5165.2,"as crazy as it sounds,"
5166.93,those subjective signals
of,what you tell yourself
5169.92,about the foods that you're eating
5171.72,can actually impact how
those,"foods will taste,"
5176.15,"maybe not immediately, but eventually,"
5177.294,and can impact the way in which your body
5180.5,utilizes those foods.
5182.35,"Now, that might seem like"
a,absolute pipe dream.
5185.56,"If I just imagine that I like mackerel,"
5187.67,mackerel will start to taste good.
5189.13,I'm not saying that.
5190.03,I didn't say that you
could,override yuck signals
5194.2,with this mechanism.
5196.32,I didn't say that you could take a food
5198.61,"that would be absolutely noxious to you,"
5201.46,or make you want to
"vomit,",and override that.
5203.36,"However, foods that are"
somewhat,neutral to you
5207.75,can take on a different value
5211.45,based on the activation
of,the dopamine system.
5214.4,"And now, knowing what you know,"
5216.41,there are a couple ways that
you,could imagine doing that.
5218.93,"First of all, you could,"
in,"this so-called gedanken,"
5222.94,"or thought experiment,"
5223.96,"you could, for instance,"
swap,"out sucralose,"
5227.55,"because sucralose is just a taste, right?"
5229.62,It's an artificial sweet taste.
5231.5,"You could swap that out,"
5233.17,"and insert kale,"
5235.41,but eat the kale with something
that,raises blood glucose
5239.81,to some degree or another.
5241.01,"Now, I'm not encouraging"
anyone,to run out there
5243.17,and spike their blood
glucose,glucose like crazy.
5245.71,"And in fact, blood glucose"
isn't,really the goal.
5249.1,"If you recall, the goal is to get neurons"
5251.96,to be metabolically active
with,"that blood glucose, okay?"
5255.22,That's what's actually rewarded
5256.62,"at a sub-sub-conscious level,"
5258.35,meaning at a deep subconscious level.
5261.02,But consuming these foods with other foods
5264.18,"that increase blood glucose,"
5265.28,"and thereby, brain metabolism,"
5267.42,"or I suppose, if you're ketogenic,"
5269.75,"here in the ketosis,"
5272.77,I don't know what the range of foods
5273.93,"that are allowed on ketosis are,"
5275.22,"so I don't want to misspeak here,"
5276.42,"and say, cracker, which"
would,probably be a sin
5279.6,"in the context of ketosis,"
5280.94,and no knock against ketosis.
5282.47,"I'm offering this, in part,"
5284.47,because I think that there are
a,number of people that have
5287.05,and can positively benefit
from,a ketogenic diet.
5290.31,"But for instance,"
5291.143,if there's a food that you
want,"to consume more of,"
5294.25,but that you find somewhat
"meh,","or mildly yuh, yuck,"
5298.31,"even pairing it with ketones,"
5301.95,"if indeed, you are using ketones"
for,"your brain metabolism,"
5305.9,'cause that's what happens
on,"the ketogenic diet,"
5308.02,"over time, that food will be reinforced"
5311.32,by the dopamine pathway.
5312.3,We know this from these studies
5313.83,where sucralose was the
substance,paired with
5316.8,the glucose elevating.
5318.98,"In other words, metabolically"
elevating,"the food substance,"
5323.01,or liquid substance.
5324.84,So how does one go about doing this?
5327.01,"Well, first of all, I want to emphasize,"
5330.25,that this experiment
actually,has been done
5332.87,in a slightly different context.
5336.15,"Studies by my colleague, Alia Crum,"
5338.82,in the Psychology Department at Stanford
5341.27,"have explored the bodily response,"
5344.66,"in terms of insulin release,"
5346.2,and the release of other food
and,"eating-related hormones,"
5350.78,as well as overall feelings
of,"satisfaction, et cetera,"
5355.02,in groups of people
that,"drink a milkshake,"
5359.68,and are either told that
it's,a low calorie shake
5362.33,that contains various nutrients
that,"are good for them,"
5365.57,or a higher calorie shake
5367.55,"that has a lot of nutrients, et cetera."
5371.03,"And what they found,"
5372.66,"was that the different groups,"
5373.84,"and here, again, I'm being very general"
5375.65,"with my description of these studies,"
5377.39,"but what they found, is that"
the,"physiological response,"
5381.02,"the insulin response, the"
blood,"glucose response,"
5383.4,and the subjective measures
5385.61,of whether or not people
enjoyed,"something or not,"
5388.14,were heavily influenced
by,what they were told
5390.61,were in these milkshakes.
5392.06,So blood glucose would go up.
5393.46,Insulin would go up
5394.293,when people were told it
was,a high calorie shake
5396.24,with lots of nutrients.
5397.27,Less so when people
ingested,"a shake that was,"
5400.75,"you know, that they were"
told,"had less nutrients,"
5404.09,and so forth.
5405.35,"When in reality, it was"
the,identical shake.
5409.69,This is incredible.
5410.523,This is a belief effect.
5411.85,"This is not placebo, right?"
5413.56,A placebo effect is different.
5415.14,Placebo effect is in comparison.
5416.9,It's where the control condition actually
5419.46,"influences outcomes to a same,"
5422.43,"or to some degree, just like"
the,experimental condition.
5426.54,This is not a placebo effect.
5427.73,"This is a belief effect,"
5429.48,where the belief and the
subjective,thoughts about
5433.21,what a given food will do
5435.27,has a direct impact on
a,"physiological measure,"
5438.35,like blood sugar and blood glucose.
5440.2,"Okay, so let's zoom out"
from,"this for a second,"
5443.21,and think about how we
can,incorporate this
5445.78,into adopting consumption of healthy foods
5450.13,that serve our brain health in
the,immediate and long-term.
5453.68,"And if you're wondering what those are,"
5454.91,I listed them out at the
beginning,"of the episode,"
5456.82,and their justification
for,being on that list.
5460.3,"What this means is,"
5461.91,"obviously, you want to"
consume,"foods that you like,"
5464.81,but because brain health
is,"very important,"
5467.72,and many of the foods
that,"promote brain health,"
5471.82,"perhaps, are not the most palatable to you"
5474.0,"or desirable to you,"
5476.1,the key would be to ingest the foods
5479.38,that you want to ingest more of
5481.43,"simply because they're good for you,"
5483.37,"and not because they taste good to you,"
5486.44,alongside foods that increase
5488.94,whatever fuel system you
happen,to be relying on.
5491.43,I think that's the most nutritionally
5493.5,politically correct way to say it.
5494.91,"So if you're keto,"
5495.743,"that would mean ketones, okay?"
5497.69,"If you're not ketogenic,"
5499.24,and I think most people
probably,"are not in ketosis,"
5501.6,"or trying to maintain ketosis,"
5503.37,"but for instance,"
5504.203,people that are on a
purely,"plant-based diet,"
5506.06,that would be one set of foods.
5507.16,"For people that are omnivores,"
5508.72,a different set of foods.
5509.553,"And for people that are carnivores,"
5510.84,yet another set of foods.
5513.24,If you want to eat more
of,a particular food
5515.09,"because it's good for you,"
5516.02,pair it with something in the same meal.
5518.55,"You don't have to hide it physically,"
5520.47,or in the flavor sense.
5522.4,You don't have to hide it
within,"that other food,"
5524.25,but pair it with that other food
5526.34,that provides you a shift
in,"brain metabolism,"
5529.9,because that's really what
your,"brain and you are seeking,"
5533.07,even though you don't realize it.
5534.84,How long will this take?
5536.21,"Well, according to the"
data,in humans on sucralose
5539.99,and the conditioning for
sucralose,"to have these effects,"
5543.95,"which, in many cases,"
were,"detrimental, right?"
5546.8,Because they were increasing insulin.
5548.41,"But in this case, you're trying to"
5550.74,hijack this conditioning
of,food preference
5553.66,"for healthy purposes,"
5555.94,"not with sucralose,"
5556.86,but by ingesting things
that,"are good for you,"
5559.2,then the data really point to the fact
5561.98,that even within a short period
of,"time of about seven days,"
5564.95,"but certainly within 14 days,"
5567.12,that food will take on
a,subjective experience
5570.65,of tasting at least better
to,"you, if not good to you."
5574.92,"Now, I believe this has"
important,implications
5577.49,for much of the controversy
5579.46,and food wars that we see out there.
5582.09,"Food wars being, of course,"
5584.23,these groups that ardently
subscribe,to the idea
5589.0,that their diet and the
things,that they are eating
5592.33,"are the foods that are good for us,"
5593.727,"and that are the most pleasureful,"
5595.67,and the things that
everyone,should be eating.
5598.55,We see this with every community
within,the nutrition realm.
5603.15,"Now, of course, there are"
studies,that point to the fact
5606.0,that certain foods and food
components,"are healthier,"
5608.97,"probably for us and for the planet,"
5611.12,but you really see it on
both,ends of the spectrum.
5612.98,You've got people who are
on,a pure carnivore diet
5614.93,who are arguing with a
lot,of biomedical evidence
5617.73,that that's what's best
for,us and beneficial.
5620.43,And then you've got
people,that are arguing
5622.13,"the same general sets of arguments,"
5624.1,but for a purely plant-based diet.
5625.64,And then I think most people
5626.61,fall into the omnivore category.
5630.39,"What's very clear, however,"
5631.92,is that what we consume on a regular basis
5635.5,and what leads to increases
in,brain metabolism
5639.62,"leads to increases in dopamine,"
5641.53,and thereby our motivation to eat them.
5644.44,"So what this really says,"
5646.73,is that what we tend to do regularly
5648.6,becomes reinforcing in and of itself.
5651.26,"And I think, in large part,"
5652.7,"can explain the fact that,"
5654.17,"yes, indeed, for certain people,"
5656.01,"a given diet not only feels good,"
5658.7,but they heavily subscribe to the nutrient
5661.42,and kind of health beneficial
effects,of that diet.
5664.74,And they often will
provide,"evidence for that,"
5667.27,whether or not you ask them for it or not.
5669.7,But that's true of every subcategory
5672.05,within the nutrition realm.
5675.32,"Again, this is not to take away"
5676.77,from some of the beautiful data
5678.48,"emphasizing that certain foods,"
5680.41,"and micronutrients, et cetera,"
5682.51,"are better for us, or worse"
for,"us, and for the planet."
5685.58,That's not a debate I want
to,get into right now.
5687.683,"What this emphasizes,"
5689.22,is that foods impact our
brain,"and its health,"
5693.53,but they also impact
how,our brain functions
5697.9,"and responds to food,"
5699.75,and that is largely a learned response.
5702.63,We can't completely
"override,","for instance,"
5705.5,that certain foods evoke a
"strong,",[grunts] yuck component.
5709.5,Certain foods are truly putrid to us.
5711.68,"I should just say, certain"
things,"are putrid to us,"
5713.57,"and we should not consume them, right?"
5716.72,"At the far end of the spectrum,"
5717.89,"it's hard-wired for us to avoid those,"
5719.9,because they can be dangerous for us.
5721.97,"They can make us very, very sick."
5724.15,"But it's also true,"
5725.64,that if we continue to eat foods
5727.79,that are progressively sweeter and sweeter
5729.55,"and highly palatable,"
5731.0,"it shifts our dopamine system,"
5732.78,because it activates our dopamine system
5734.97,to make us believe that those foods
5736.85,are the only foods that can
trigger,"this reward system,"
5739.96,"and make us feel good,"
and,that they taste good.
5742.19,But after consuming foods
that,perhaps are less sweet
5746.07,"or even less savory,"
5747.95,"that are not what we would call highly,"
5749.91,"or I would say, nowadays,"
it's,"super palatable foods,"
5752.32,we can adjust our sense literally
5756.22,of what we perceive as an
attractive,"and rewarding food,"
5759.82,"and indeed, the dopamine system"
5761.62,will reward those foods accordingly.
5764.32,I can't emphasize enough
5765.55,how much this learning
of,associated food reward
5770.04,is important for not just understanding
5772.79,"why we like the foods that we eat,"
5774.57,and how to eat more of foods
that,"are healthy for us,"
5777.44,"and enjoy them,"
5779.07,but it also speaks to the fact
that,"our brain, as a whole,"
5784.07,is a perceptual device
trying,to make guesses
5786.82,or estimations about
5788.13,what certain foods are going to do for us.
5790.45,"So put simply,"
5791.99,we don't just like sweet
foods,"because they taste good,"
5794.04,we like them because they predict
5795.33,a certain kind of metabolic response.
5798.42,"This is important also,"
5799.53,"because Dana Small, and Ivan de Araujo,"
5804.14,and others have been exploring
5805.56,"whether or not people, for instance,"
5807.48,"that have type 2 diabetes,"
5809.83,or that suffer from any number
5811.09,"of different metabolic disorders,"
5812.36,whether or not somehow
5813.25,these food reward systems
are,"permanently disrupted,"
5816.63,and through a beautiful set of experiments
5818.52,that have been done by mainly
by,"Dana Small's group at Yale,"
5821.61,but also by the de
Araujo,"group and others,"
5825.81,exploring how the reward
pathways,are altered
5830.3,"in various metabolic disorders, et cetera,"
5832.79,people suffering from type 2 diabetes.
5836.11,We don't have time to go
into,"all those data now,"
5838.07,"but the takeaway is,"
5839.4,"that food preference,"
5841.3,and the ability to reshape these circuits
5843.77,is not disrupted in these people
5846.15,"to the point where it can't be rewired,"
5848.24,"and that's very encouraging,"
5849.37,"because what it means is that,"
5850.71,for people that are suffering
from,"these syndromes,"
5853.35,through some simple
alterations,"in dietary choice,"
5857.81,provided those are carried out over time
5859.89,"and in the correct way,"
5861.58,by pairing with the foods
that,will appropriately
5864.78,"shift metabolism of the brain,"
5866.49,one can actually rewire what they consider
5868.78,"not just palatable,"
5869.82,but attractive as foods.
5871.5,If you want to learn
more,about food reward
5875.6,"and food reinforcement,"
5876.83,"'cause it turns out, those"
are,"slightly different things,"
5879.15,there's a wonderful review
written,by Ivan de Araujo.
5882.96,"They have a middle author,"
Mark,"Schachter, and Dana Small."
5886.07,"It's called ""Rethinking Food Reward"","
5887.87,and it was published in the
Annual,Reviews of Psychology.
5890.83,You can find it very easily online.
5892.25,It was published in 2019.
5894.07,"And it's a beautiful, deep dive,"
5896.28,"although, quite accessible to most people,"
5898.49,"about how different foods,"
5900.72,and the way that we perceive them
5902.57,"impacts our brain and body,"
5904.03,"and why we like the things we like,"
5905.79,and how to reshape what we like.
5908.07,"So once again, we've done a"
fairly,extensive deep dive
5911.14,"into food and your brain,"
5913.69,focusing first on how particular foods
5916.83,and compounds within foods
5918.8,that are available also
through,supplementation
5921.28,can impact immediate and
long-term,brain health.
5923.272,Came up with a relatively short list
5926.8,"of what I would call super foods,"
5928.82,only because there are
ample,data to support
5932.37,their role in enhancing short
and,"long-term cognition,"
5935.29,"and neuronal health, and so on."
5937.33,"And we also talked about food preference,"
5940.33,"and why particular tastes,"
5942.32,"and particular events within the gut,"
5944.3,and particular events
within,the brain combine
5947.7,"to lead us to pursue particular foods,"
5950.95,"and to avoid other foods,"
5952.71,and how you can leverage those pathways
5955.37,in order to pursue more of the foods
5957.18,that are going to be
good,"for you, and good,"
5959.41,"not just for your brain,"
5960.42,"but for your overall body health,"
5962.15,and to enjoy them along the way.
5964.01,"If you're learning from, and"
are,"enjoying this podcast,"
5966.73,please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
5968.45,That's a terrific zero
cost,way to support us.
5970.75,"In addition, please leave us suggestions"
5973.05,for future topics and guests
you,would like us to host
5975.85,in the comment section on YouTube.
5978.06,"As well, please subscribe to"
5979.74,the Huberman Lab Podcast
on,Apple and/or Spotify.
5982.48,"And on Apple, you can leave"
us,up to a five star review.
5986.03,If you're not already
following,"us on Instagram,"
5988.41,"we are Huberman Lab at Instagram,"
5990.65,"and there, I do neuroscience tutorials"
5993.17,that sometimes have
overlapped,"with the podcast,"
5995.24,"but often, are original"
content,altogether.
5998.09,We are also Huberman Lab on Twitter.
6000.97,Another terrific way to support us
6002.52,is by checking out our sponsors
6004.03,that we mentioned at the
beginning,of the episode.
6005.98,we also have a Patreon.
6007.23,It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
6009.94,"And there, you can support the podcast"
6011.72,at any level that you like.
6013.97,"During today's podcast, and on"
many,"other previous episodes,"
6016.98,we talked about various supplements.
6018.84,One of the major issues with supplements
6021.01,is that supplement
companies,don't always have
6023.32,"the highest quality standards,"
6024.8,and/or the amounts of the supplements
6027.31,that they list on the bottle
6028.42,aren't what actually are
contained,"in the capsules,"
6030.78,"and pills, and powders"
of,those supplements.
6033.1,"For that reason, we partner"
with,"Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,"
6035.88,because Thorne has the
highest,levels of stringency
6038.92,with respect to the quality
of,"the supplements they use,"
6042.05,and the quantity of the
supplements,they use.
6044.4,They partnered with all
the,"major sports teams,"
6046.2,"and with the Mayo Clinic,"
6047.24,and we have tremendous confidence
6048.67,in the quality of their supplements.
6049.99,If you'd like to see the
supplements,"that I take,"
6052.17,"you can go to Thorne,"
thorne.com/u/huberman.,
6058.26,"There, you can get 20% off"
any,of those supplements.
6060.87,And if you navigate into the main site
6063.34,through that portal of
"thorne.com/u/huberman,",
6066.46,you can also get 20% off any
6068.1,of the supplements that Thorne makes.
6070.25,"And last, but not least,"
6072.45,thank you for your interest in science.
