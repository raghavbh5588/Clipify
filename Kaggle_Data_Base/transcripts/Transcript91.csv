0.37,- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast 
2.35,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.93,for everyday life. 
9.47,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.5,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.32,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.28,This podcast is separate from my teaching 
17.03,and research roles at Stanford. 
18.71,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
20.93,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
23.8,and science-related tools to the general public. 
26.9,"In keeping with that theme, "
28.17,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
31.28,Our first sponsor is ROKA. 
33.46,ROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses. 
36.07,And I'm delighted that they're a partner 
37.98,and a sponsor for the podcast. 
40.1,As some of you may already know I've spent two decades 
43.07,"or more studying the visual system, "
45.02,how we see? 
45.853,Vision is absolutely the most important sense 
48.52,by which humans navigate the world and survive. 
51.04,And our eyes as two pieces of our brain 
53.27,do many other important things as well. 
55.49,So taking good care of our eyesight is essential. 
58.45,Founded by two All-Americans swimmers from Stanford. 
61.33,ROKA was born out of an obsession for performance. 
64.37,They've carefully put science and purpose 
65.88,behind their design choices 
67.22,and they built absolutely terrific products as a result. 
70.25,The glasses are amazing. 
71.23,I love them because they look great. 
73.99,They are super comfortable 
75.3,and the optical clarity is incredible. 
78.21,They filter out sunlight in a way 
79.813,that still allows you to see contrast and shadows 
82.38,the way you need to. 
83.213,"And for me, one of the things that's really irritating "
85.01,is if I have a pair of sunglasses 
86.72,that don't allow me to see all the things I want to see. 
89.69,"And with ROKA glasses, "
91.56,I get incredible contrast but then I can also relax 
94.57,and be outdoors in bright light. 
96.08,And as the amount of light changes with cloud cover 
98.6,"and things of that sort, "
99.99,my ability to see my surroundings 
101.56,coz it's still really sharp and really clear. 
103.147,And that only comes from really understanding 
105.51,"how the visual system works, "
106.91,and how it adjusts to contrast and adaptation 
109.63,and all these different things. 
110.48,They really understand the science 
112.16,and that went into the design of these glasses. 
114.69,"And as many of you know, "
116.13,sunlight and the viewing of light 
117.97,is also very important for setting circadian rhythm. 
120.71,So that's also been incorporated into the design and science 
123.41,behind these glasses. 
124.77,I do wear readers. 
125.89,"I don't often wear them during the podcast, "
127.86,but I have to wear reading glasses at night. 
129.55,So I use their readers and I own a pair of their sunglasses. 
132.99,And I'm delighted with them. 
134.75,"If you'd like to check out ROKA glasses, "

149.31,Today's podcast is also brought to you by InsideTracker. 
152.17,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
155.26,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
157.71,to help you better understand your body 
159.26,and reach your health goals. 
161.09,I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done 
163.87,for the simple reason that many of the important things 
167.24,that are vital to our immediate and long-term health 
170.57,can only be detected in a good quality blood test. 
174.3,The problem with blood tests is that most blood tests 
177.35,you get a lot of information back about that are too high 
179.96,or too low of this thing or the other thing. 
181.97,"But making sense of that, "
182.947,and what to do with that information is very challenging. 
185.63,"Even if you have a really attentive physician, "
188.18,oftentimes it's mysterious 
189.93,as to what to do with all this data. 
191.84,"With InsideTracker, they make it very easy to understand "
194.57,"what all the metabolic factors, hormone factors, et cetera, "
198.08,mean for you and what to do about those markers. 
201.08,"So they offer you directives in terms of nutrition, "
203.81,"supplementation, as well as lifestyle factors "
206.8,"like exercise, sleep, et cetera, "
209.07,that can allow you to take control of those numbers 
211.47,and bring them into the ranges that are best for you 
214.28,and your long-term health. 
215.91,Another feature of InsideTracker 
217.28,that's great is their inner age test. 
219.47,This test shows you what your biological age 
221.53,"and how it compares to your chronological age, "
223.7,which I can only imagine most everybody including me 
226.76,are extremely interested in how long am I likely to live? 
229.04,How old am I really in terms of my biology? 
232.52,If you'd like to try InsideTracker

242.94,Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. 
246.13,Athletic Greens is an all-in-one 
247.77,"vitamin, mineral, probiotic drink. "
250.27,I've been using Athletic Greens since 
"2012,",
252.87,and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
256.04,"With athletic greens, "
257.06,you get a ton of factors that are good for you 
259.75,mixed into this one really good tasting drink. 
262.21,I like to mix mine with water 
263.64,"and a little bit of lemon juice, "
265.02,and I drink that once or twice a day. 
266.9,"Typically, once early in the day, "
268.77,and sometimes also in the afternoon or even evening. 
271.53,I'm able to sleep after drinking in the evening just fine. 
274.69,The reason I been using Athletic Greens for so long 
277.4,"that I continue to use Athletic Greens is that, "
280.03,"one, I feel better when I take it. "
281.86,I just do. 
282.693,"Psychologically, physically, I feel better. "
284.95,But also it covers all my bases of the things 
287.7,that I need for my general health. 
289.78,It's sort of a foundational supplement as I like to call it. 
292.53,"In fact, when people ask me, "
293.82,what should I take? 
295.43,If I were to recommend just one supplement 
297.23,that people take it would be Athletic Greens. 
300.0,"With Athletic Greens, you get support for your gut "
302.67,"which is important, "
303.61,because the gut microbiome is important 
305.297,"for the gut brain access, for mood, metabolism, "
307.92,"hormones, et cetera. "
308.83,There are so many data that support that statement. 
311.49,"As well, there are many factors in Athletic Greens "
314.87,"that support general health metabolism, "
316.92,"endocrine factors, immunity, et cetera. "
319.52,"So with Athletic Greens, I drink it once or twice a day. "
322.03,And I know that I've got all that covered. 
324.18,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
325.65,you can go to www.athleticgreens.com/huberman. 
328.82,"And if you do that, you can claim a special offer. "
331.16,They'll send you five free travel packs 
332.94,"plus a year supplies, excuse me, "
335.25,of vitamin D
3+K,
2.,
337.52,So you get the five free travel packs 
339.59,and a year supply of D
3,
340.93,if you go to www.athleticgreens.com/huberman 
344.04,you can claim that special offer. 
345.79,"For the last month four episodes to be exact, "
349.38,we've been discussing physical performance 
351.52,and skill learning. 
353.45,"We've talked about how to learn skills faster, "
356.08,"whether or not those are skills, athletic performance, "
359.1,"dance, music, things of that sort. "
362.21,We've also talked about how to gain strength 
364.45,and how to lose fat faster by leveraging the nervous system. 
368.01,"Things like shiver and non-shiver, "
371.33,non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis. 
374.49,We talked about how neurons can actually trigger 
377.26,accelerated fat loss. 
379.2,We talked about hypertrophy also called muscle growth 
382.49,"and we covered everything from sets and reps protocols, "
386.28,how long to stay in a cold ice bath? 
388.17,When to get out? 
389.39,How to keep shivering? 
390.76,We've covered a lot of tools and a lot of science. 
393.76,So if you're interested in those things 
395.12,and you even perhaps want to learn a little bit about 
398.4,"how we make energy ATP from carbohydrates or from fats, "
402.51,it's all covered in the previous four episodes. 
405.32,This was going to be the time 
406.57,"that we moved to a new topic entirely, "
409.54,but we are going to do one more episode in this series 
412.51,on physical performance. 
413.84,For the simple reason that you asked many questions 
417.58,about something that's vitally important 
419.71,both for physical performance and long-term 
422.27,and short-term health and that's endurance. 
426.01,And so today we are going to talk about endurance. 
428.92,"Now, if you're a strength athlete "
430.86,"or you're not interested in endurance, "
434.39,"don't depart just yet, "
435.71,because it turns out that there are ways to train endurance 
438.66,that are very different 
440.42,than I would have previously imagined. 
443.32,"If you only think about long runs, "
445.66,"long swims, marathons, half marathons, "
"10Ks,",
5Ks,
449.8,and that sort of thing puts you to sleep 
451.71,kind of like Costello is snoring in the background 
453.62,right now. 
454.79,"He's not a long distance endurance athlete, "
457.45,that's for sure. 
459.57,If you're interested in those things 
461.05,"or if you are averse to those things, "
463.55,I encourage you to continue listening 
465.38,because we are going to talk about a little bit of science 
468.32,and then some specific protocols 
470.18,that really define what endurance is? 
472.64,The four types of endurance 
474.22,and ways to train those in concert with the other things 
478.23,that you might be doing like weight training 
480.18,or skill training or yoga. 
483.35,"And if you are an endurance athlete, "
485.38,we are going to cover a lot of tools and science 
488.32,that I'm certain will also help enhance your training 
491.14,and performance in races 
493.17,or even just recreationally. 
495.49,The topic of endurance I think 
497.99,"has been badly misrepresented, frankly, online. "
502.16,And when you'd start digging into the science 
504.2,"and you start talking to real experts in this area, "
507.29,"what you discover, what I've discovered is that, "
509.53,it's an incredibly interesting area 
511.41,because it teaches us so much about how our body 
514.59,and our brain use fuels and how we can control which fuels 
520.23,are used by our body and brain? 
522.54,So today we will talk about the four kinds of endurance. 
525.99,We will also cover the topic of hydration 
528.87,which might sound incredibly boring. 
531.56,"Like, okay, just drink more water. "
533.4,But it's really interesting 
534.95,because not only is hydration a limiting factor 
538.8,"on performance, "
539.633,"but there is a right way to hydrate, "
542.17,and there is a wrong way to hydrate. 
544.24,There actually is a formula 
545.7,that I'll teach you to know how much water to be drinking 
549.84,depending on your activity levels. 
551.35,"And if that sounds like a simple thing, "
553.85,"like, oh, just tap off water until your urine runs clear. "
557.07,That's actually the wrong advice. 
559.4,"It turns out that if you don't hydrate properly, "
561.45,you can see 
20,to 
30%,"reductions in performance, "
564.45,"whether or not that strength, "
566.04,"whether that's increasing hypertrophy, "
568.58,"whether or not that's running, swimming, "
570.32,even mental performance. 
572.14,So even if you're not an athlete 
573.74,"or a recreational athlete at all, "
575.5,I encourage you to stay tuned for the part about hydration. 
578.93,So we're going to cover as usual a little bit of science 
581.76,and then we're going to dive right into protocols 
584.02,"that you can apply if you like, "
585.427,and if you deem those correct and safe for you. 
588.94,"Before we dive into all that, "
590.18,"I want to make an important announcement, "
591.67,which has all the episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast 
594.89,"are now housed on a single website, "
597.43,which is www.hubermanlab.com. 
599.91,"If you go to www.hubermanlab.com, "
601.7,"you can find all the episodes in YouTube, "
604.14,Apple and Spotify format with links there. 
607.13,The website is also searchable. 
608.87,So if you go into the little search function 
610.77,"which you'll find very easily, "
611.89,"and you put in, for instance, creatine or sleep "
615.51,"or ice bath or sauna, "
617.73,it will take you to the specific episodes 
620.65,that contain that information. 
622.97,"And in addition, if you go to the website "
625.53,"www.hubermanlab.com, "
626.41,you have the opportunity to sign up 
628.52,for what we call the Huberman Lab Neural Network. 
631.7,The Huberman Lab Neural Network is a zero cost resource 
634.59,where once a month perhaps more often 
637.42,"you'll receive a email newsletter, "
640.31,"and that newsletter will contain specific protocols, "
643.34,"announcements, attachments of PDFs and things of that sort "
647.03,"of protocols, tools and science from the podcast. "
651.0,We will also make any announcements about live lectures 
655.19,which at some point I'll probably start doing 
656.95,in various cities in the US 
658.61,"and probably around the world as well, "
660.55,as well as other things that I think 
662.24,would be really useful to you all of course at zero cost. 
665.74,"So that's www.hubermanlab.com, "
667.58,sign up for the Neural Network newsletter. 
670.02,You can find that in the menu tab 
671.59,or it might pop up when you get there. 
673.48,And I hope you will join. 
675.04,"And as a final announcement, "
676.99,"if you're not already following us on Instagram, "
679.61,you can go to Huberman Lab on Instagram. 
681.6,"And if you do that, "
682.62,I often make announcements and release protocols 
685.25,and links to protocols and things there as well. 
688.34,I briefly want to touch on something 
689.76,"from the previous episode which is that, "
693.13,if you are somebody that is trying 
694.43,"to increase muscle strength and or size, "
697.51,or if you're simply somebody 
699.27,"who doesn't want to increase muscle strength and size, "
702.49,"and you just want to maintain the musculature that you have, "
705.96,it's vital that you perform at least five sets 
708.69,of resistance training per muscle per week. 
712.27,"If we don't do that, we lose muscle over time. "
715.18,And that is one reason among many 
719.03,to have a regular resistance training protocol. 
722.75,Nobody wants to start resembling a folded over envelope 
726.35,or a melted candle. 
728.33,No one wants to have challenges getting up out of a chair 
730.77,or off the ground. 
732.33,"Maintaining musculature is vital, "
734.3,"not just to our immediate health, "
736.03,but to our long-term health trajectory. 
738.81,So I just want to emphasize that point. 
740.43,"If you're curious about the sets, the reps, "
742.73,how close to failure to go or not go? 
745.55,Whether or not you should be doing 
747.38,your cardiovascular training 
749.13,before or after your weight training? 
750.7,All of that is in the previous episode 
752.63,"right down to the details, "
753.84,and I like to think made simple for you to understand. 
757.19,But I do strongly believe that resistance training 
759.89,whether or not it's with body weight or bands or weights 
763.24,or simply lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard 
766.93,"is vital for our systemic physiology and our overall health, "
771.33,and that includes our brain health. 
772.87,And I described the reasons for that and the mechanisms 
775.14,in the previous episode. 
776.62,"Today, I'd like to talk about endurance "
778.81,"and how to build endurance, "
781.05,and how to use endurance for the health of your entire body. 
786.58,"Endurance, as the name suggests is our ability to engage "
790.08,"in continuous bouts of exercise, "
792.8,or continuous movement or continuous effort of any kind. 
798.08,And I do believe that our ability to engage in activities 
803.51,that we call endurance training 
805.87,or physical endurance activities 
808.24,do have carry over to mental performance of things 
813.55,that require long-term effort. 
816.32,I'll touch on that at the end 
817.61,and why there's reason to believe 
819.65,that there is a biological crossover 
821.6,between those two things. 
823.62,I don't think it's simply the case 
824.95,that if you train yourself to be a strength 
826.407,and speed athlete and to do short bouts of exercise 
829.12,"are very intense, "
830.26,that you can only do mental work 
832.54,that's of short bouts and very intense. 
835.55,"But it is clear that cardiovascular exercise, "
840.54,exercise where you're getting your heart rate up 
842.61,"continuously for a period of time, "
844.32,and endurance exercise we will define 
846.27,"what that is in a moment, "
847.89,is vital for tapping into and enhancing various aspects 
852.41,of our biology in the body end in the brain 
856.04,such that our brain can perform work 
859.64,"for longer periods of time, "
861.12,"focused work, learning, et cetera. "
863.96,So I want to dive into the topic of endurance 
866.53,and I want to just begin by addressing something 
870.26,"that's vital to any kind of effort, "
873.03,whether that's mental effort or physical effort. 
875.24,So as always a little bit of science 
876.72,and we'll get right into protocols. 
878.87,So the key thing to understand 
881.47,"about energy production in the body, "
883.58,"meaning your ability to think, "
885.13,"your ability to talk, your ability to walk, "
887.53,your ability to run is this thing that we call ATP. 
892.06,"ATP and mitochondria, which are just little "
897.03,what we call organelles within cells. 
899.12,"These little factories that make energy, if you will. "
904.08,"ATP is required for anything that requires energy, "
908.05,for anything that you do that requires effort. 
910.92,And there are different ways to get ATP. 
915.34,And we have been gifted as a species with the ability 
919.87,to convert lots of things into ATP. 
924.06,"We can convert carbohydrates, "
926.72,"literally the kinds of carbohydrates eat a bagel, "
928.69,you eat a piece of pizza. 
929.8,"Pizza usually is dough, and it has cheese "
932.76,and some other things. 
934.39,Costello hears me talking about pizza. 
935.76,"Costello loves pizza, by the way. "
938.47,"Eating a piece of pizza, "
939.45,"it gets converted into various things, "
942.08,"fatty acids from the fats, glucose from the bread, "
946.99,"and those things get converted into ATP within cells, "
952.39,"through things like like glycolysis, things like lipolysis. "
955.27,I talked about this in previous episodes. 
957.29,So our muscles and our neurons use different fuel sources 
962.77,to generate ATP. 
965.55,The ones that are used first for short bouts 
968.32,of intense activity are things like phosphocreatine. 
970.92,If you've only heard about creatine as a supplement. 
972.92,"Well, phosphocreatine actually exists on our muscles, "
975.347,and that's why people take creatine. 
976.92,You can load your muscles with more creatine. 
979.12,"And though, and excuse me. "
981.9,"Phosphocreatine is great for short, intense bouts of effort. "
986.54,"So when you're really pushing hard on something physical, "
988.9,let's say you see a car on the side of the road 
990.83,"and that car is stalled and a person says, "
992.847,"""Hey, can you help me push my car?"" "
994.2,And you start to push. 
995.659,That's going to be phosphocreatine 
996.55,is going to be your main fuel source. 
998.34,Then you start to tap into things like glucose 
1000.99,which is literally just carbohydrate is the sugar 
1003.36,that's in your blood. 
1004.81,"And then if you keep pushing on that car, "
1007.04,"you keep engaging in a particular effort, "
1009.45,"or you keep studying or you keep listening to this podcast, "
1012.61,you start to tap into other fuel sources like glycogen 
1015.81,"from your liver, which is just, "
1017.09,"it's like a little pack, "
1018.45,just like you might have packed a sandwich 
1020.59,or something for work. 
1022.39,You have a little pack of glycogen in your liver 
1025.62,that you can rely on. 
1027.22,And you have fat stored in adipose tissue. 
1029.87,"Even if you have very, very low body fat percentage "
1033.1,like you're one of these people as like 
3%,or 
5%,body fat 
1036.5,"really thin skin, very little body fat, "
1040.29,you can extract lipids fatty acids from that body fat. 
1044.87,"It's like a storage pack, "
1046.04,it is a storage pack for energy 
1047.68,that can be converted to ATP. 
1049.47,"So without going into any more detail, "
1053.09,"when I say today energy or I say ATP, "
1055.99,"just remember that regardless of your diet, "
1059.74,"regardless of your nutritional plan, "
1061.92,"your body has the capacity to use creatine, "
1065.81,"glucose, glycogen, lipids. "
1068.27,"And if you're ketogenic, ketones. "
1070.84,We'll talk about ketosis. 
1072.89,"In order to generate fuel, energy. "
1076.8,"Now, the other crucial point is that, "
1079.62,in order to complete that process of taking these fuels 
1083.1,"and converting them into energy, "
1085.61,most of the time you need oxygen. 
1089.82,You need air basically in your system. 
1092.35,"Now, it's not actual air. "
1093.41,"You need oxygen molecules in your system, "
1096.5,"comes in through your mouth and your nose, "
1098.41,goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream. 
1102.14,"Oxygen is not a fuel, "
1104.77,but like a fire that has no oxygen 
1107.9,"you can't actually burn the logs, "
1109.94,"but when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire, "
1114.21,"basically, onto logs with a flame there, "
1117.56,"then basically it will take fire, "
1120.76,it will burn. 
1121.593,Okay? 
1122.426,Oxygen allows you to burn fuel. 
1125.17,So today we are going to ask the critical questions. 
1129.09,What allows us to perform? 
1131.84,What allows us to continue effort for long periods of time? 
1136.0,"And that effort could be a run, "
1137.65,"it could be a swim, "
1138.73,"it could be studying, "
1140.21,it could be anything that extends 
1142.41,over a long period of time. 
1144.62,"Well, you're going to need energy "
1146.36,and you're going to need oxygen. 
1148.54,But the way to answer a question 
1150.95,"like what allows us to endure, right? "
1154.36,Endurance. 
1155.193,What allows us to keep going? 
1157.71,"Well, we think of things like willpower. "
1159.69,But what's willpower? 
1160.523,Willpower is neurons. 
1162.14,It's neurons in our brain. 
1163.96,We have this thing called the central governor 
1165.59,which decides whether or not we should or could continue 
1168.61,"or whether or not we should stop, "
1171.16,whether or not we should quit. 
1172.93,Okay? 
1173.763,So whether or not you're somebody 
1174.81,who has a lot of what we would call resilience 
1176.91,"and endurance, "
1177.743,or whether or not you're somebody who taps out early 
1179.99,"and quits early or can't handle frustration, "
1182.19,that has to do with your fuel utilization 
1184.46,and specific neurons. 
1185.81,"So we have to ask the question, "
1187.96,what is the limiting factor on performance? 
1191.1,Right? 
1191.933,"So instead of saying, what allows us to endure? "
1193.83,"We should say, what prevents us from enduring? "
1196.58,What prevents us from moving forward? 
1198.53,"What are the factors that say, "
1200.36,you know what? 
1201.23,"No more, I'm not going to continue this run. "
1203.81,Or you know what? 
1205.07,"I've had a really long, hard day "
1207.04,"or maybe I've had an easy day or I'm feeling lazy, "
1209.03,I just don't even really feel like getting up and moving. 
1211.64,So what we're going to talk about today 
1212.87,actually gets right down to the heart of motivation 
1215.76,and fuel use. 
1216.8,Motivation and fuel allocation. 
1219.48,And we are going to talk about specific training protocols 
1222.28,that you can follow that have carry over 
1225.7,"between the bodily systems of running swimming, et cetera, "
1229.22,and the way that your brain works. 
1231.36,"So let's talk about endurance by asking first, "
1233.9,what are the limiting factors on endurance? 
1236.86,What stops us? 
1238.66,"Because in addressing that and answering that, "
1240.92,we will understand what allows us to get into effort 
1244.78,and to continue effort. 
1246.36,There are five main categories of things 
1248.765,that allow us to engage in effort. 
1251.87,"And they are neurons, nerves, muscle, "
1257.16,"muscle, blood, things in our blood, "
1261.61,our heart and our lungs. 
1264.67,"Now, I don't want to completely write off things "
1266.96,"like the immune system and other systems of the body, "
1270.02,"but nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs "
1273.33,"are the five that I want to focus on today, "
1275.37,because that's where most of the data are. 
1279.01,"As we go forward into this, "
1280.26,"I want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin, "
1283.17,"who as with the last episode, "
1285.247,has been tremendously helpful and informative 
1288.13,in terms of the exercise physiology. 
1290.04,He's a true expert. 
1291.84,"He has a laboratory, "
1292.97,"he's a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy, "
1297.47,"who understands the science, "
1298.81,but who also works with athletes 
1300.93,"and works with recreational athletes, "
1303.17,professional athletes really understands 
1305.32,at a variety of levels how all these systems work? 
1307.74,"He's the person I consulted with about today's episode, "
1310.99,although I did access other literature as well. 
1312.86,"And I'm going to mention a key review for any of you, "
1316.06,"afficionados, who really want to get down into the weeds. "
1318.5,"But I encourage you, if you want more detail "
1321.35,"to check out Dr. Andy Galpin's YouTube page, "
1324.28,I think he's also on Twitter. 
1325.88,He's definitely on Instagram. 
1327.7,"His content is excellent, "
1329.64,and he really understands... 
1332.005,I have learned and I really believe 
1333.19,that an intellectual is somebody 
1335.37,who understands a topic at multiple levels 
1338.5,of specificity of detail and can communicate that. 
1341.6,And Andy is a true intellectual of muscle physiology 
1345.67,and performance. 
1346.81,And if you hear the word intellectual 
1348.62,"and you kind of back up and cringe from that, "
1350.77,understand that he's also a practitioner. 
1353.07,"So thank you, Andrew Galpin. "
1355.3,Andy Galpin for your support in these episodes 
1360.46,and we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon. 
1364.29,"So nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs. "
1366.21,Let's talk about neurons and how they work. 
1368.47,Okay? 
1369.303,But I want to tell you about an experiment 
1371.16,that's going to make it very clear 
1373.88,why quitting is a mental thing not a physical thing. 
1378.34,So why do we quit? 
1380.01,"Well, an experiment was done a couple years ago "
1382.59,and was published in the journal Cell. 
1384.16,"Cell Press journal, excellent journal "
1386.48,"showing that there is a class of neurons in our brain stem, "
1391.54,"in the back of our brain that if they shut off, we quit. "
1399.0,"Now, these neurons release epinephrin. "
1404.03,Epinephrin is adrenaline. 
1405.25,"And anytime we are engaged in effort of any kind, "
1408.23,we are releasing epinephrin. 
1409.73,"Anytime we're awake really, we are releasing epinephrin "
1412.96,into our brain. 
1415.21,"In fact, this little roup of neurons "
1418.74,in the back of our brain is called the locus coeruleus 
1420.93,if you like. 
1421.98,"It's churning out epinephrin all the time, "
1424.26,"but if something stresses us out, "
1425.97,it churns out more and then it acts 
1427.88,as kind of an alertness signal for the whole brain. 
1430.72,We also of course have adrenaline epinephrin 
1432.83,released in our body which makes our body ready for things. 
1435.69,So think about epinephrin as a readiness signal. 
1438.65,"And when we are engaged in effort, "
1441.06,this readiness signal is being churned into our brain. 
1443.31,"When we relax and we're falling asleep, "
1445.03,epinephrin levels are low. 
1447.81,"Okay, so they did a really interesting experiment "
1451.87,where they had subjects engage in bouts of effort 
1457.54,of trying to move forward toward a goal. 
1460.22,But they manipulated the visual environment 
1462.55,"with the stripes, "
1463.52,kind of like fences passing on both sides of them. 
1467.22,"And by doing that, they could trick subjects "
1470.34,into thinking that their effort was either allowing them 
1473.99,"to move forward, right? "
1475.46,"Because these rungs on the fence were moving past, "
1479.2,or that their effort was futile 
1481.88,that they were no longer moving forward 
1483.46,because they would make the runs move slowly 
1485.31,even though the subjects were making a lot of effort 
1487.73,to move forward. 
1488.95,Okay? 
1489.783,So this is analogous or similar to being on a treadmill 
1492.4,and you're trying to walk on this treadmill 
1494.24,"and you just can't move the conveyor, right? "
1497.32,Or you're in virtual reality 
1499.01,"and you're putting a ton of effort, "
1500.47,but it seems like you're moving excruciatingly slow. 
1502.67,I had this experience recently in real life. 
1505.29,"I was doing a swim in the Pacific, "
1507.45,I was trying to go south and I was swimming 
1510.66,"and I was caught in a current, "
1512.08,not the cup that pulls you out to ocean. 
1514.2,"And I kept looking to my left, "
1516.37,"and I saw this hotel on the shoreline, "
1519.1,and then I was swimming and swimming 
1520.86,"and swimming and swimming, "
1521.78,and 
20,minutes later I looked to my left and the hotel 
1524.25,"is still exactly where it was before, "
1526.19,which meant that I wasn't moving. 
1528.44,It felt futile. 
1530.54,"Eventually, either the current changed or something changed "
1534.35,"and I eventually swam past the hotel, "
1537.67,got back on the beach and eventually drove home. 
1541.22,That's essentially what they did in this experiment. 
1543.18,But what they found was these neurons 
1545.5,"that release epinephrin, "
1548.44,"there's another cell type called glia, "
1551.34,"which actually means glue in Latin, "
1553.31,that is paying attention to how much epinephrin 
1555.51,is being released. 
1556.343,And at some point the system reaches a threshold. 
1560.09,It reaches this threshold 
1561.38,and it shuts off the release of more epinephrin. 
1564.41,"It's like I quit, that's it, "
1566.17,no more effort signal. 
1569.24,If they could extend the time 
1572.16,"before those glia said, ah, enough. "
1575.81,"If they could release more adrenaline into the system, "
1578.34,then subjects would keep going. 
1580.67,"So our desire to continue or put differently, "
1585.69,our willingness to continue and our desire to quit 
1589.49,is mediated by events between our two ears. 
1593.47,"Now, that doesn't mean that the body's not involved, "
1595.58,but it means that neurons are critically important. 
1597.71,So we have two categories of neurons that are important. 
1599.95,The ones in our head that tell us get up 
1602.04,and go out and take that run. 
1603.86,And the ones that allow us and encourage us to continue 
1607.84,"that run, "
1608.673,and we have neurons that shut things off 
1610.2,and say no more. 
1611.4,And we of course have the neurons 
1612.95,that connect to our muscles and control our muscles. 
1615.67,"But the reason we quit is rarely because our body quits, "
1619.64,our mind quits. 
1621.54,"Now, we never want to encourage people "
1622.81,"to drive themselves to the point of injury, "
1625.96,"that's not going to be good for anybody, "
1629.46,but it is good to know that it's neural. 
1633.15,Our ability to persist is neural. 
1635.06,"So when people say is it, I hear that, "
1637.53,"you know, sports or effort or fighting, "
1639.97,or it's 
90%,"mental, "
10%,physical. 
1645.22,"That whole discussion about how much is mental, "
1647.23,how much is physical? 
1648.063,Is absolutely silly. 
1649.32,It just proves that there's no knowledge 
1651.67,of the underlying biology behind that statement. 
1654.39,It's neither mental nor physical. 
1656.68,"Everything is physical, "
1658.72,everything is neurons. 
1660.05,Your thinking is the responsibility of chemicals 
1663.33,and electrical signals in your head. 
1664.83,So it's not 
90%,"mental, "
10%,physical. 
1667.91,It's not 
50/,
50.,
1669.11,It's not 
70/,
"30,",it's 
100%,nervous system. 
1673.9,It's neurons. 
1675.41,Okay? 
1676.243,"So when people say mental or physical, "
1678.24,understand it's 
100%,neural. 
1681.09,"And I'd love for the, how much of it is mental "
1683.814,and how much is physical to just disappear. 
1687.56,That argument means nothing 
1688.72,and it's not actionable. 
1690.07,"Now, what do nerves need in order to continue to fire? "
1693.84,"What do you need in order to get neurons to say, "
1696.65,I will persist. 
1697.89,"Well, they need glucose. "
1699.88,"Unless you're on keto and ketogenic adapted, "
1704.11,you need carbohydrate is glucose. 
1706.4,That's what neurons run on. 
1708.89,And you need electrolytes. 
1711.73,Neurons have what's called a sodium potassium pump 
1715.05,"blah, blah, blah. "
1715.883,They generate electricity. 
1716.84,We could go into all this. 
1717.82,I will probably do an entire lecture 
1719.09,"about the action potential, "
1720.07,"but basically in order to get nerve cells to fire, "
1723.93,"to contract muscle, "
1725.26,"to say, I'm going to continue. "
1726.9,"You need sufficient sodium, salt, "
1729.97,because the action potential the actual firing of neurons 
1734.51,"is driven by sodium entering the cell, "
1737.32,rushing into the cell. 
1738.94,And then there's a removal of potassium. 
1741.93,And then there's a kind of resetting of those levels 
1744.37,by something called the sodium potassium pump. 
1746.09,And the sodium potassium pump and sodium 
1748.014,"and action potentials, "
1749.89,even if you don't know anything about that is ATP dependent. 
1753.58,It requires energy. 
1755.45,So you need energy in order to get neurons to fire. 
1759.51,And it is pH dependent. 
1761.27,It depends on the conditions 
1763.56,or the environment within the brain being of a certain pH 
1766.5,or acidity. 
1767.58,pH is about how acid or how basic the environment is? 
1772.05,And we will talk a little bit about pH in simple terms 
1774.28,so you can understand. 
1775.113,"So nerves need salt, they need potassium. "
1777.82,And it turns out they need magnesium 
1779.72,and you need glucose and carbohydrates 
1782.12,"in order to power those neurons, "
1783.41,unless you are running on ketones. 
1786.4,"And to run on ketones, "
1787.86,you have to make sure that you're fully keto adapted. 
1790.95,I will talk about adding in ketones on top of carbohydrate 
1794.56,at the end of the episode. 
1796.34,"Okay, so that's how nerves work. "
1797.98,"You need carbohydrate, "
1799.03,"you need sodium, potassium and magnesium "
1800.92,in order to drive the brain. 
1804.23,Muscle. 
1805.063,Muscle is going to engage in generating energy first 
1808.83,by using this phosphocreatine system. 
1811.51,"High bouts of effort really intense effort, "
1814.08,"short-lived seconds to minutes, "
1816.51,but probably more like seconds 
1817.7,is going to be this phosphate creating literally a fuel source 
1820.12,"in the muscle that you're going to burn, "
1821.73,just like you would logs on a fire. 
1824.83,"And glycogen which is stored carbohydrate in the muscle, "
1828.32,that also can be burned just like logs on a fire 
1830.73,to generate energy. 
1831.7,So let me make this crystal clear. 
1833.28,If you move your wrist towards your shoulder 
1835.2,"and contract your bicep really hard, "
1837.33,muscle fibers are burning up their own carbohydrate. 
1839.98,They're converting that into ATP 
1841.8,in order to generate that energy. 
1844.04,Okay? 
1845.03,And pH is important and temperature is important. 
1850.51,"In the episode on supercharge your physical performance, "
1853.82,I talked all about how by using cooling specifically 
1857.78,of the palms or the bottoms of the feet 
1859.73,"or the cheeks of the face using particular methods, "
1862.7,you can adjust the temperature of the body and of muscle 
1867.78,"in a way that allows you to do more work, "
1870.13,"to do more reps, to run further, "
1872.47,to keep going and to persist. 
1874.78,"And that's because if temperature is too low or too high, "
1880.15,then ATP is not going to be available 
1884.01,because of this whole thing 
1884.843,called the pyruvate kinase pathway 
1886.7,and the temperature dependence of pyruvate kinase. 
1888.68,Check out that episode if you want to learn more about that. 
1890.52,But temperature is important and pH is also important. 
1893.6,"So we got nerve, muscle, "
1894.72,and then there's stuff in our blood 
1896.55,that's available as an energy source. 
1898.85,"And in blood, we got glucose. "
1900.41,So literally blood sugar that's floating around. 
1902.24,"So let's say you have fasted for three days, "
1904.47,your blood glucose is going to be very low. 
1906.48,"So that's not going to be a great fuel source, "
1908.82,but you will start to liberate fats 
1910.72,from your adipose tissue from your fat. 
1913.35,Fatty acids will start to mobilize into the bloodstream 
1915.81,and you can burn those for energy. 
1918.9,"And oxygen in your blood when you inhale, [inhales deeply] "
1921.68,you're bringing oxygen into your blood. 
1923.19,"So these are all fuel sources in your neurons, "
1925.41,"in your muscle, in your blood, "
1927.33,in your various tissues that are providing the opportunity 
1934.825,to induce effort whether or not it's a run or swim 
1937.53,or writing or talking. 
1939.29,"Now, there are some other factors that are important "
1942.89,and those are the heart which is going to move blood. 
1946.13,"So the more that the heart can move blood and oxygen, "
1950.03,"well, the more fuel that's going to be available for you "
1954.16,to engage in muscular effort and thinking effort. 
1958.23,So your heart vitally important to your muscles ability 
1961.67,to work and your brain's ability to work. 
1963.66,"And as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times, "
1966.69,it should be obvious then that the lungs are very important. 
1969.04,"You need to bring oxygen in, "
1970.71,"and distribute it to all these tissues, "
1972.7,because oxygen is critical for the conversion 
1975.321,of carbohydrates and the conversion of fats. 
1980.13,And we could get into the discussion about 
1982.62,"whether or not oxygen is important for ketogenic metabolism, "
1985.54,"but you need oxygen there, "
1986.96,you need to breathe and you need to breathe properly. 
1989.69,So I just covered what would normally be about four lectures 
1994.33,of energy consumption and energy utilization. 
1996.99,I didn't go into much detail at all. 
1998.35,"But what I want you to imagine is that, "
2001.47,you've got these different cell types. 
2003.42,"You've got neurons, you've got muscle, "
2005.62,they need to collaborate in order to generate effort 
2008.48,or to make the decision to do something 
2010.21,or to think hard or to run hard or to run far. 
2013.11,"And then you've got fuel sources both in the neurons, "
2017.29,"in the muscle, in your blood, "
2020.29,and then the heart and lungs are going to help 
2022.99,distribute the oxygen and those fuels. 
2026.74,And of course you have that little energy pack 
2028.57,that we call the liver that will allow you to pull out 
2032.14,a little more carbohydrate if you need it for work. 
2035.34,Okay? 
2036.173,"So that's as much as I want to cover about energy consumption, "
2039.21,because that's a lot. 
2040.9,But what it tells you is that when you eat 
2043.06,"and you use food as a fuel source, "
2045.05,that food can be broken down 
2047.89,and you can immediately burn the glucose 
2050.07,"that's in your bloodstream, "
2050.94,"or you can rely on some of the stored fuel in your liver, "
2053.78,"or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle, "
2056.01,so-called glycogen. 
2057.4,And there are a lot of different ways 
2059.1,that we can generate ATP. 
2060.99,"So when we ask the question, "
2062.25,what's limiting for performance? 
2065.35,"What is going to allow us to endure, "
2068.32,to engage in effort and endure long bouts of effort 
2071.94,or even moderately long bouts of effort? 
2074.58,"We need to ask which of those things, "
2076.6,"nerve, muscle, blood, heart and lungs is limiting? "
2080.66,"Or put differently, "
2081.86,"we ask, what should we be doing with our neurons? "
2084.08,What should we be doing with our muscles? 
2085.42,What should we be doing with our blood? 
2087.07,What should we be doing with our heart 
2088.23,and what should we be doing with our lungs 
2090.35,that's going to allow us to build endurance 
2093.97,for mental and physical work 
2096.02,"and to be able to go longer, further with more intensity? "
2102.97,That's the real question? 
2103.99,How can we do more work? 
2106.13,"And the way we do that is with energy, "
2108.03,"and the way to get energy to it, "
2109.25,is to buy those five things. 
2110.55,"And so now we're going to talk about, "
2112.29,how you can actually build different types of endurance? 
2116.49,"And what that does at the level of your blood, "
2119.81,"your heart, your muscles and your neurons. "
2121.54,"So we're going to skip back and forth between protocols, tools "
2125.5,and the underlying science. 
2126.93,So rather than heavy stack the science at the front end 
2129.57,"and then just give you all the tools at the end, "
2131.27,"we're going to talk about the protocols, "
2134.81,the four kinds of endurance and how to achieve them? 
2137.25,And we are going to talk about the underlying science 
2139.58,as we move through that. 
2141.57,"If you would like a lot of detailed science, "
2144.22,I encourage you to check out a review 
2146.23,that we've linked in the show notes. 
2148.84,And the review is called adaptations to endurance 
2151.86,and strength training. 
2153.16,This is a review article with many excellent citations. 
2156.56,It's from Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine. 
2159.31,The Cold Spring Harbor Press 
2160.35,is an excellent scientific press. 
2162.37,Spent the last 
21,years doing summers at Cold Spring Harbor 
2165.87,"teaching neuroscience, "
2167.26,but Cold Spring Harbor is involved in all sorts of themes 
2170.24,and topics related to neuroscience and medicine. 
2174.28,This review by Hughes L.Ellefson. 
2178.63,Ellefson that's the name. 
2179.78,"Ellefson and Barr, B-A-A-R. "
2182.18,Adaptations through endurance and strength training 
2184.24,is rich with citations. 
2186.09,It can be downloaded as a complete PDF. 
2188.44,There's no paywall and we will link to it. 
2190.88,"And it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades, "
2195.02,the genetic changes within muscle 
2197.272,"with high intensity interval training, "
2199.28,"short-term, super high intensity training, weight training. "
2203.86,So if you're a real nerd for this stuff 
2206.42,and you want to get right down into how PGC-
"1alpha,",
2209.045,P
53,and PH
20,change the adaptation features of muscle 
2214.04,"and gene regulation, "
2215.0,that is definitely the review for you. 
2216.75,"If you're like most people, "
2218.13,"and you're not really interested in that level of detail, "
2220.81,"no reason to pick up the review, "
2222.18,unless you just want to check out 
2223.29,some of the figures and pictures. 
2225.55,But I do want to offer that as a resource 
2227.83,"it's been in addition to discussions with Dr. Andy Galpin, "
2231.41,it's been a primary resource for the content 
2234.1,of this episode. 
2235.71,So let's talk about the four kinds of endurance 
2238.42,and how to achieve those? 
2240.66,I do believe that everybody should have some sort 
2243.64,"of endurance practice, regular endurance practice. "
2247.41,It's clear that it's vital for the functioning of the body 
2250.28,and the mind. 
2251.5,And there are clear longevity benefits. 
2255.224,"There are a lot of reasons why that's true, "
2258.13,but the main one is that if we have good energy utilization 
2264.66,"in our musculature and in our blood, "
2268.34,"in our vascular system and in our oxygenating system, "
2272.8,"our lungs, the so-called cardiovascular system, "
2275.23,respiratory system and musculature. 
2277.71,The body and brain function much better. 
2280.08,"There are so many papers now, so much data to support that. "
2284.17,So I do believe everyone should either try to maintain 
2287.89,"the muscle that they have, "
2289.6,provided they've already gone through puberty 
2291.27,and development. 
2292.69,And they should be engaged in regular endurance exercise. 
2296.79,"Now, for many people, they think endurance exercise. "
2299.66,That means what? 
2301.05,A hour long run or I got to get on the StairMaster 
2304.4,or I have to treadmill for hours on end each week. 
2307.33,And it turns out that's not the case. 
2308.69,"There are four kinds of endurance, "
2310.35,"and you can train specifically for any one of those, "
2313.56,and you can vary your training. 
2315.09,So let's talk about those four kinds of endurance. 
2317.4,These are very interesting 
2318.52,and they each have very different protocols 
2321.79,that you use in order to build and maximize them. 
2325.48,And now you'll understand what fuel sources they use 
2329.44,in order to build that thing we call endurance. 
2331.69,"So first of all, we have muscular endurance. "
2335.49,Muscular endurance is the ability for our muscles 
2340.93,"to perform work over time, "
2344.25,and our failure to continue to be able to perform 
2348.3,"that work is going to be due to muscular fatigue, "
2352.41,not to cardiovascular fatigue. 
2355.13,So not because we're breathing too hard 
2356.85,or we can't get enough blood to the muscles 
2359.16,"or because we quit mentally, "
2361.23,but because the muscles themselves give out. 
2364.8,Okay? 
2365.633,"One good example of this would be, "
2368.22,if you had to pick up a stone in the yard 
2372.69,"and that stone is not extremely heavy for you, "
2376.41,and you needed to do that anywhere from 
50,to a 
100,"times, "
2380.9,and you were picking it up and putting it down 
2382.57,and picking it up and putting it down 
2383.79,and picking up and putting it down. 
2385.48,"At some point, your muscles will fatigue. "
2388.59,They will fail to endure. 
2390.77,Muscular endurance is incredibly useful 
2393.87,for a variety of physical pursuits. 
2396.798,And we will talk about the mental pursuits 
2398.85,that it supports as well. 
2400.57,"In terms of physical pursuits, "
2402.76,the ability for a given muscle to perform repeated work 
2406.92,is going to improve your golf swing. 
2409.36,It's going to improve your tennis swing. 
2411.72,"It's going to improve your posture, "
2413.57,"your ability to dance, "
2414.84,your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity 
2418.75,that requires effort in a way that's very different 
2423.32,from the kind of endurance that you will build simply 
2425.84,"by increasing your cardiovascular fitness, "
2428.27,your ability to generate kind of easy repetition. 
2431.28,So let's talk about muscular endurance and what it is? 
2433.98,Muscular endurance is going to be something 
2436.77,that you can perform for anywhere from 
12,to 
"25,",
2442.14,or even up to 
100,repetitions. 
2444.76,And that's actually how if you like 
2446.74,you would train muscular endurance. 
2448.76,And I'll give the specific protocol in a few moments. 
2451.92,"So a good example is push-ups, right? "
2454.95,"If you were to get on the floor and start doing push-ups, "
2459.66,"even if you're somebody who has to do knees down push-ups, "
2462.84,"and you're doing your push-ups, "
2464.18,eventually you won't be able to do any more push-ups 
2466.57,and that's not going to be because you couldn't get enough 
2470.32,"oxygen into your system, "
2472.14,or your heart wasn't pumping enough blood. 
2474.99,It's going to be because the muscles fail. 
2477.41,That's why. 
2478.43,So if you want to be able to do more push-ups 
2480.54,or even more pull-ups. 
2482.18,Muscular endurance is really what it's about. 
2485.14,It's actually no coincidence that a lot of military bootcamp 
2488.47,"style training is not done with weights, "
2490.76,"it's done with things like push-ups, pull-ups, "
2492.69,sit-ups and running. 
2494.03,Because what they're really building is muscular endurance. 
2496.24,The ability to perform work repeatedly over time 
2499.57,for a given set of muscles and neurons. 
2502.37,So what's a good protocol to build muscular endurance. 
2504.57,Let's just give that to you now 
2505.56,and explain some of the underlying science as it follows. 
2510.64,So a really good muscular endurance training protocol 
2514.76,"according to the scientific literature would be, "
2516.76,three to five sets of anywhere from 
12,to 
100,repetitions. 
2522.48,That's a huge range. 
2524.17,"Now, "
12,to 
25,repetitions is going to be more reasonable 
2530.12,for most people. 
2531.62,And the rest periods are going to be anywhere 
2534.24,from 
30,to 
180,seconds of rest. 
2537.48,So anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest. 
2539.92,"So this might be five sets of push-ups, "
2542.98,done getting your maximum push-ups 
2544.42,although for some people that might be zero 
2546.53,and you have to do it knees down. 
2547.87,For some people it might be 
10,"push-ups, "
2549.39,for some people might be 
"25,",
2550.54,but you could go all the way up to 
100.,
2552.2,Rest anywhere from 
30,to 
180,"seconds, "
2555.06,and then do your next set 
2556.5,for a total of three to five sets. 
2558.42,So it doesn't actually sound like a ton of work. 
2560.73,The other thing you could do is something like a plank. 
2563.07,A plank position is actually a way 
2566.53,"to build muscular endurance, not strength. "
2570.945,Okay? 
2571.778,"I'm sure it could be used to develop strength, "
2573.69,but it's really about muscular endurance. 
2575.41,So you would do three to five sets of planks. 
2577.98,Those planks would probably even 
2579.66,"because you're not doing repetitions, "
2580.85,"it's an isometric hold as we say, "
2582.58,as kind of static hold or a wall sit 
2585.0,would be another example. 
2586.23,"And you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes, "
2590.1,take some rest of anywhere from 
"30,",
"60,",or 
180,"seconds, "
2593.8,and then repeat. 
2595.02,"So things like pushing a sled, push-ups, "
2597.602,"isometric planks, even pull-ups, "
2601.0,those will all work. 
2603.49,"And as with others forms of training, "
2606.98,"you would want to do this, "
2608.25,until you approach failure or actually fail 
2611.45,and where you're unable to perform another repetition 
2614.11,that would mark the end of a set. 
2616.74,The one critical feature of building muscular endurance 
2620.06,is that it has no major east centric loading component. 
2624.94,"Now, I haven't talked much about eccentric "
2627.99,and concentric loading. 
2629.81,But concentric loading is when you are shortening 
2633.01,the muscle typically or lifting a weight. 
2636.03,And east centric movements 
2637.34,are when you are lengthening a muscle typically 
2639.89,or lowering a weight. 
2641.68,So if you do a pull up and you get your chin over the bar 
2644.81,"or a chin up, that's the concentric portion of the effort, "
2648.22,"and then as you lower yourself, "
2649.33,that's the eccentric portion. 
2651.397,"Eccentric portion of resistance training of any kind, "
2655.27,whether or not it's for endurance or for strength 
2657.29,is one of the major causes of soreness. 
2660.2,"Some people will be more susceptible to this, "
2663.71,"excuse me than others, "
2665.16,but it does create more damage in muscle fibers. 
2668.96,Muscular endurance and building muscular endurance 
2671.84,should not include any movements 
2673.61,that include major eccentric loads. 
2676.41,"So if you're going to do push-ups, "
2678.93,"it doesn't mean that you want to drop, "
2680.34,"you know, smash your chest into the floor. "
2682.94,And by the way your chest should touch the ground 
2684.62,on every push-up. 
2686.01,That's a real push-up. 
2687.3,Okay? 
2688.133,It's not about breaking 
90,"with the elbows, "
2689.7,it's about pushing down until your chest touch the floor 
2692.22,and straightening out. 
2693.053,That's a proper push-up. 
2694.35,And a pull-up is where you pull up your chin above the bar. 
2697.73,Neither of those should include a slow eccentric 
2700.73,or lowering component. 
2702.17,If you are using those to train muscular endurance 
2705.05,the three to five sets of 
12,to 
25,
2707.417,and maybe even up to 
100,repetitions 
2709.76,with 
"3,",
280,seconds of rest in between. 
2714.09,That means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool 
2718.79,"for building muscular endurance, "
2721.52,because jumping has a slowing down component as you land. 
2725.46,So things like plyometrics or agility work 
2728.34,"where you're moving from side to side, "
2729.73,"and you're decelerating, "
2730.79,"you're slowing yourself down a lot, "
2732.53,not going to be good for muscular endurance. 
2734.66,Terrific for cardiovascular training 
2737.04,and conditioning of other kinds and skill training 
2739.13,and agility and all that. 
2740.68,"But if you want to build muscular endurance, "
2743.64,you want to make your muscles able to do more work for longer. 
2747.96,It's going to be this three to five sets 
2749.86,of 
12,to 
100,"reps, "
2751.979,
30,to 
180,seconds of mainly concentric movement. 
2756.22,Okay? 
2757.053,Not a slow lowering phase or a heavy lowering phase. 
2762.0,So that might be kettlebell swings and things of that sort. 
2765.61,"Isometrics, as I mentioned, things like planks "
2767.36,and wall sets will work. 
2768.94,"Now, what's interesting about this is that, "
2771.4,it doesn't seem at all like what people normally 
2774.26,think of as endurance. 
2775.6,"And yet it's been shown in nice, quality "
2778.97,"peer-reviewed studies, "
2780.07,several of which are cited in the review 
2781.84,"I mentioned earlier, "
2783.23,that muscular endurance can improve our ability 
2787.67,"to engage in long bouts of what we call long duration, "
2791.63,low-intensity endurance work. 
2793.61,So this can support long runs. 
2795.62,It can support long swims. 
2797.26,And it can build also... 
2800.09,It can build postural strength and endurance simultaneously 
2805.32,and that's mainly accomplished through isometrical. 
2808.12,So things like planks are actually quite good 
2811.77,for building endurance of the spinal erector muscles 
2814.41,that provide posture of the abdominal muscles 
2817.57,that are helpful for posture for being upright 
2820.25,for the upper neck muscles and things of that sort. 
2823.47,These days everyone seems to have texts neck. 
2825.52,Everyone is basically staring at their toes all the time 
2827.79,as a default towards their toes. 
2829.61,So isometric holds can be very good 
2831.59,for building muscular endurance. 
2833.78,"You can spot people including yourself, "
2836.89,perhaps with poor muscular endurance in the postural muscles 
2840.96,"because anytime they stop moving, "
2842.69,they have to lean against a wall 
2844.38,"or their hip will move to one side, "
2846.61,or they're always leaned to one side. 
2848.33,I am guilty of this too. 
2849.9,Some of you have actually pointed out. 
2851.6,I like to think out of concern 
2853.41,that I often am rubbing my lower back. 
2856.28,And indeed I have some asymmetries of my postural muscles 
2859.04,some of which are probably genetic 
2860.45,and some of which are probably just from excessive work 
2863.322,or something of that sort 
2864.53,that have my right shoulder set lower than my left 
2867.01,and things of that sort. 
2868.0,"If I wanted to improve those, "
2869.71,I could improve those by really focusing on symmetry 
2872.18,and isometric. 
2873.2,Symmetry meaning holding my hands at equivalent positions 
2876.24,in planks and doing isometric holds 
2879.31,for building muscular endurance of the postural muscles. 
2883.11,"But this can also be done with, "
2884.75,"as I mentioned, kettlebell swings for the lower back "
2886.8,and legs and posterior chain. 
2888.55,So there are a number of different exercises 
2889.87,"you could do this with, "
2890.703,but it should be compound exercises mainly. 
2894.24,It's rare for people to do this kind of muscular endurance 
2897.4,work specifically for things like bicep curls or triceps. 
2901.66,And there aren't many activities 
2903.18,that really rely on isolation of those muscles 
2905.247,"and repeatedly, right? "
2906.69,It's hard... 
2907.523,"I'm sure there are some out there, "
2908.356,but it's kind of hard to imagine. 
2910.22,"So you can do this with isometrics, "
2912.6,you can do this with more standard 
2914.9,"non-isometric type movements, "
2916.18,but make sure there isn't a strong eccentric load. 
2918.73,So now let's talk about the science briefly 
2920.54,of why this works? 
2922.49,"Well, that takes us back to this issue of fuel utilization "
2926.97,and what fails? 
2928.67,"So if we would say, okay, let's say you do a plank "
2932.68,"and you're planking for, "
2934.48,"you know, maybe you're able to plank for a minute "
2936.37,or two minutes or three minutes. 
2938.36,At some point you will fail. 
2940.02,You're not going to fail because the heart gives out. 
2942.34,You're not going to fail because you can't get enough oxygen 
2945.67,because you can breathe while you're doing that. 
2947.58,You're going to fail because of local muscular failure. 
2950.18,"Which means that as you do, "
2951.78,"if you choose to do this protocol of three to five sets, "
2955.26,"et cetera, et cetera, to build muscular endurance, "
2958.75,mainly what you are going to be building 
2961.76,is you're going to be building the ability 
2964.28,of your mitochondria to use oxygen 
2967.45,to generate energy locally. 
2969.27,And that is something called mitochondrial respiration. 
2972.59,Respiration because of the involvement of oxygen. 
2976.27,And it's also going to be increasing the extent 
2981.18,to which the neurons control the muscles 
2984.7,and provide a stimulus for the muscles to contract. 
2988.37,But this is independent of power and strength. 
2991.3,Okay? 
2992.133,So even though the low sets like three to five sets 
2995.37,and the fact that you're doing repetitions 
2997.35,"and you're going to failure, "
2999.1,even though it seems to resemble power and strength 
3002.077,"and hypertrophy type training, it is distinctly different. "
3005.02,"It's not going to generate strength, hypertrophy and power. "
3008.26,It's going to mainly create this ability to endure 
3011.69,to continually contract muscles 
3013.76,or repeatedly contract muscles. 
3015.98,Okay? 
3016.813,"Continually if you're using isometric holds, "
3019.2,"repeatedly, excuse me, "
3020.22,if you're using repetition type exercise 
3023.52,where there's a contraction and an extension the muscle 
3027.72,essentially concentric and an eccentric portion. 
3030.84,But remember that you want the eccentric portion to be light 
3034.91,"and relatively fast, "
3036.35,"not so fast that you injure yourself, "
3037.66,but certainly not deliberately slowed down. 
3040.77,"It was recommended, I should say by Andy Galpin "
3046.2,"that you not use Olympic lifts for this, "
3048.86,because once you get past eight or 
12,or 
25,"repetitions, "
3053.07,especially form on those Olympic lifts is key 
3056.24,for not getting injured. 
3058.02,And while some people can perform those sorts of of lifts 
3061.06,likes snatches and deadlifts and cleans and jerks 
3063.81,"and overhead presses, "
3065.4,probably not a great idea if the goal is to push the body 
3070.14,"to points of fatigue, "
3071.22,"because you do open yourself up to injury, "
3072.96,"unless you're very skilled at doing that, "
3074.54,or you have a really good coach 
3075.61,who can help you guide through those lifts. 
3077.93,So that's one form of endurance 
3079.81,which is muscular endurance. 
3080.643,And it's mainly going to rely on neural energy. 
3084.23,So nerves and muscle. 
3086.93,And it's not going to rely quite so much 
3088.95,"on what's available in your blood, your heart or your lungs. "
3092.64,So now let's talk about the other extreme of endurance 
3095.68,which is long duration endurance. 
3098.32,This is the type that people typically think about 
3100.731,when they think about endurance. 
3103.01,"You're talking about a long run, a long swim, "
3106.63,a long bike ride. 
3107.95,"Well, how long we'll anywhere from "
12,minutes 
3111.96,"to several hours or maybe even an entire day, "
3115.06,maybe eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking. 
3118.54,Some people are actually doing those kinds 
3119.77,"of really long events marathons, for instance. "
3122.71,So anything longer than 
12,minutes. 
3125.43,And this type of work builds on fuel utilization 
3130.6,"in the muscles, "
3132.39,it builds on the activity of neurons in the brain 
3135.73,that are involved in what we call 
3137.25,central pattern generators. 
3138.74,We talked about this in a previous episode 
3141.15,or several previous episodes. 
3142.57,These are groups of neurons that allow our body 
3144.78,to engage in regular rhythmic effort 
3147.37,without having to think about the movement too much. 
3149.73,So running and stepping or swimming 
3151.77,"if you already know how to swim, "
3152.99,"or peddling on a bike or walking upstairs and hiking, "
3156.04,"you're not thinking about right, left, right, left. "
3158.79,It's all carried out by central pattern generators. 
3162.14,This is going to be at less than a hundred percent 
3165.5,"of your maximum oxygen uptake, "
3167.85,your VO
2,"max, I'll talk about what VO"
2,max is. 
3170.55,"But I just want to give a sense of what the protocol is, "
3172.74,and the underlying science. 
3174.78,How many sets? 
3176.63,One. 
3177.51,Long duration effort is one set of 
12,minutes or longer. 
3182.85,So you're not counting repetitions. 
3184.18,I sure hope that if you're going out on a 
30,minute run 
3186.35,or even a 
15,"minute run, "
3187.3,"that you're not counting steps, "
3190.18,"that you're not counting pedal strokes, "
3191.81,that you're not on the rower counting poles on the rower. 
3195.69,"I suppose you could, "
3196.68,but I think that would be pretty dreadful. 
3198.83,Seems like a poor utilization of cognitive brain space. 
3202.5,You're getting into regular repeated effort 
3205.97,and your ability to continue that effort 
3209.72,is going to be dependent mainly on the efficiency 
3212.92,of the movement on your ability to strike a balance 
3216.39,"between the movement itself, "
3220.06,"the generation of the muscular movements that are required, "
3223.79,and fuel utilization across the different sources 
3227.94,"of nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs. "
3230.27,So let's ask the question. 
3231.24,Why would you fail on a long run? 
3233.16,Why would you quit? 
3234.54,"Well, as you set out on that long run, "
3237.14,assuming you have some glycogen in your liver 
3238.9,"and in your muscles, you're going to use that energy first, "
3241.4,even if it's very low intensity. 
3242.91,"I guess we're not talking about sprinting, "
3244.46,we're talking about heading out the door 
3246.79,or starting off on a marathon. 
3249.31,You're starting to assuming you have some conditioning 
3251.39,"or even if you don't, "
3252.223,you're going to burn carbohydrate. 
3253.64,"You're going to burn glucose in the bloodstream, "
3255.33,you're going to burn carbohydrate as those muscles contract. 
3257.72,Those what we call slow twitch muscles. 
3259.1,"They're contracting, "
3259.933,they start burning up fuel to make ATP 
3262.15,to continue to contract. 
3265.08,Your mind is going to use more or less energy 
3269.43,"depending on how much willpower, "
3272.04,how much of a fight you have to get into with yourself 
3274.64,in order to generate the effort. 
3276.16,I really want to underscore this. 
3277.74,"If you're somebody that's thinking, "
3278.85,"maybe I go for the run, "
3279.683,maybe I don't go for the run. 
3280.63,I'll do it at two o'clock. 
3281.59,"Okay, "
2:,
05.,
3282.423,"No, I only want to go on the half hour "
3283.97,or maybe on the main hour. 
3285.05,And you're going through all that. 
3286.51,Guess what? 
3287.343,You're burning up useful energy 
3289.9,"that you could use either for the run, for example, "
3293.65,or for something else. 
3295.06,"When we think about something hard, "
3296.56,"when we ruminate, "
3298.3,"when we perseverate on an idea or on a decision, "
3302.83,we are burning neural energy and neural energy 
3305.81,is glucose and epinephrin and all the things 
3309.02,we talked about before. 
3310.47,So willpower in part is the ability 
3314.76,to devote resources to things 
3317.57,and part of that is making decisions 
3319.48,to just either do it or not do it. 
3321.44,I'm not of the just do it mindset. 
3323.41,I think there's a right time and a place to train. 
3325.77,But I also think that it is not good. 
3329.2,"In other words, it utilizes excessive resources "
3332.43,"to churn over decisions excessively, "
3335.45,and you probably burn as much cognitive energy 
3339.33,deciding about whether or not to do a given training or not 
3342.19,as you do in the actual training. 
3345.31,Okay? 
3346.143,So we'll talk more about how this long duration effort 
3348.01,"can relate to mental performance, "
3349.74,"but the long duration effort should be one set, "
3352.2,
12,minutes or longer. 
3353.63,It could go for 
30,minutes or 
60,minutes or an hour. 
3356.65,We'll talk about programming later in the episode. 
3359.1,This is going to be less than a hundred percent 
3360.75,of your maximum oxygen uptake. 
3363.51,Your heart rate is not going to be through the ceiling 
3365.39,or maxed out. 
3366.92,But it's all about efficiency of movement. 
3369.61,That's what you're building. 
3371.03,When you go out for a run that's 
30,"minutes, "
3372.95,you are building the capacity to repeat that performance. 
3378.11,"The next time, while being more efficient "
3380.92,actually burning less fuel. 
3383.42,"And that might seem a little bit counterintuitive, "
3385.77,"but every time you do that run, "
3388.39,what you're doing is you're building up 
3390.27,mitochondrial density. 
3392.13,It's not so much about mitochondrial oxidation 
3395.55,and respiration. 
3396.93,You're building up mitochondrial density. 
3399.27,You're actually increasing the amount of ATP 
3401.96,that you can create for a given about of effort. 
3405.18,You're becoming more efficient. 
3407.5,Okay? 
3408.333,You're burning less fuel overall doing the same thing. 
3411.99,That's really what these long slow distance 
3414.14,or long bouts of effort are really all about. 
3416.61,"Now, why do this long duration effort? "
3418.67,Why would you want to do it? 
3419.86,Why is it good for you? 
3420.87,"Well, it does something very important "
3424.53,which is that it builds the capillary beds within muscles. 
3428.47,So let's talk a little bit about vasculature. 
3430.33,"We haven't done this too much yet, "
3433.1,but if you have seen the episode 
3435.58,on supercharging performance. 
3436.94,We talked about these AVAs arteriovenous anastomosis 
3441.62,"where blood moves from arteries directly into veins, "
3446.75,"but that's unusual, "
3448.7,that only takes place in the so-called glabrous skin 
3453.88,"of the palms, the face and the bottoms of the feet. "
3456.56,"Typically, for most all other areas of the body "
3460.61,"what happens is, "
3462.21,"arteries bring blood to a given tissue like a muscle, "
3466.45,and veins return that blood back to the heart. 
3470.77,"There are exceptions, but in general. "
3472.56,And in between arteries and veins are these little tiny 
3476.1,what are called capillary beds or microcapillaries. 
3478.76,"So these are tiny little avenues, "
3480.65,like little tiny streams and estuaries 
3482.94,between the bigger arteries and veins. 
3485.49,"Now, those are actually contained within muscle. "
3490.16,And what's amazing is that you can increase 
3492.64,the number of them. 
3493.76,You can literally build new capillaries. 
3495.7,You can create new little streams within your muscles 
3499.6,and the type of long duration effort 
3501.88,that I was talking about before to 
12,minutes or more 
3504.24,"of steady effort is very useful for doing that, "
3509.2,"and is very useful for increasing the mitochondria, "
3512.76,"the energy producing elements of the cells, "
3515.76,the actual muscle cells. 
3517.91,And the reason is when blood arrives to muscles 
3522.96,it has oxygen. 
3524.56,The muscles are going to use some of that oxygen. 
3526.61,And then some of the deoxygenated blood 
3528.54,is going to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs. 
3531.94,"Now, the more capillaries that you build into those muscles, "
3535.99,the more oxygen available to those muscles. 
3539.85,I don't want to get too much into the physics of fluid flow. 
3542.99,But basically it's the difference between taking a hose 
3545.8,and sticking it into some dirt just directly like 
3549.63,"and turning on the faucet at a given rate, "
3552.55,"the spigot rather, "
3554.1,or having a bunch of little hoses 
3556.08,like a sprinkler system that go out 
3557.65,and irrigate the whole yard. 
3559.29,The irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system. 
3562.65,And it's very good at using energy sources within blood. 
3567.46,"So the simple way to think about this is, "
3569.84,"when you go out for a run, "
3571.11,"let's say it's the first run you've done for a while, "
3572.81,and you out for 
12,or 
15,minutes 
3574.68,and somewhere right around 
20,minutes 
3576.327,"you're like, that's it. "
3577.46,I just can't continue. 
3578.99,"Well, when you come back the next time to do that run, "
3582.18,you've built endurance largely 
3586.03,because you've built these capillary beds. 
3588.28,You've expanded these little streams 
3590.3,in which blood can deliver oxygen to the muscles. 
3592.97,And so it's going to feel relatively straightforward 
3595.73,"to either go a little bit quicker for the same duration, "
3598.81,the same distance. 
3599.99,Or to extend that run for another five to 
10,minutes. 
3604.25,"So this long duration work, "
3606.17,unlike muscular endurance like planks 
3608.33,and everything that we were talking about before 
3610.62,is really about building the capillary systems 
3613.36,"and the mitochondria, "
3614.75,the energy utilization systems 
3616.69,within the muscles themselves. 
3619.11,And that's very important to understand. 
3621.22,It's distinctly different than say building the neurons 
3624.15,that fire the muscles. 
3625.26,"The neurons are already there, "
3626.52,they're going to fire those muscles just fine. 
3628.44,"In fact, if your life depended on it, "
3630.39,today you could probably run a marathon. 
3632.38,"You'd probably get injured, "
3633.43,it would be very psychologically and physically painful. 
3635.6,I don't recommend you do that unless you're trained for it. 
3637.99,"But if you were to train properly for it, "
3639.94,if you were to do long duration bouts of effort 
3642.68,once or twice a week or three times a week 
3645.01,"pretty soon it would become easy, "
3646.46,because you're building these vascular micro beds 
3649.13,or microvascular beds as they're called. 
3651.62,Okay? 
3652.453,So you're able to bring more energy to the muscles 
3654.7,and they're able to utilize more energy. 
3656.98,So that's long duration. 
3658.63,So we've got muscular endurance 
3659.7,and we've got long duration endurance. 
3661.43,And then there are two kinds in between 
3664.38,that in recent years have gotten a lot of attention 
3667.5,"and excitement, "
3668.61,but most people are not distinguishing 
3670.28,between these two kinds of endurance. 
3673.5,And that's a shame because in failing to distinguish 
3677.06,between the two kinds of what we call 
3678.54,"high-intensity training, "
3680.27,sometimes called high intensity interval training. 
3683.3,"Most people, perhaps you, "
3685.38,are not getting nearly as much physical 
3687.96,and mental benefit out of high intensity training 
3691.14,as you could. 
3692.13,So I want to talk about the two kinds 
3693.73,"of high-intensity interval training, "
3696.06,"and what each of them does for your brain and body, "
3698.88,and what sorts of adaptations they cause? 
3701.57,"Because in doing that, "
3702.99,you can really start to build up specific energy systems 
3706.83,in your brain and body in ways that are best serve you 
3709.97,for your cognitive work. 
3712.58,And for other sorts of things like strength and speed 
3715.9,or hypertrophy or for running marathons for that matter. 
3719.63,So there are two kinds of high intensity training 
3722.394,for endurance. 
3723.63,Sometimes called high-intensity interval training. 
3727.25,"One, is anaerobic, so-called an aerobic endurance, "
3731.41,so no oxygen. 
3732.52,And the other is aerobic endurance. 
3734.64,"Both of which qualify as HIIT, "
3737.89,high intensity interval training. 
3739.15,So let's talk about anaerobic endurance first. 
3742.73,Anaerobic endurance from a protocol perspective 
3746.63,is going to be three to 
12,sets. 
3751.088,Okay? 
3752.32,And these records and I'll talk about 
3754.765,"what the repetitions are, "
3757.16,are going to be performed at whatever speed allows you 
3761.05,"to complete the work in good, safe form. "
3764.44,Okay? 
3765.273,"So it could be fast, it could be slow "
3766.55,"as the work continues, "
3768.53,"your repetitions may slow down, "
3770.47,or it may speed up. 
3771.81,Chances are it's going to slow down. 
3773.01,So what does this work? 
3774.79,What are the sets look like? 
3776.21,Remember long slow distance is one set. 
3779.06,Muscular endurance is three to five sets. 
3781.05,High-intensity anaerobic endurance 
3783.14,is going to be somewhere between three and 
12,sets. 
3787.29,And it's going to have a ratio of work to rest 
3791.58,of anywhere from three to one to one to five. 
3795.91,Okay? 
3796.743,So what would a three to one ratio set look like? 
3800.9,"Well, it's going to be "
30,seconds of hard pedaling 
3804.19,"on the bike, for instance, or running or on the rower. "
3808.69,These are just examples. 
3809.83,"It could be in the pool, swimming. "
3811.26,"It could be any number of things or air squats, "
3813.35,or weighted squats if you will provided you can manage that. 
3818.51,
30,"seconds on, "
10,seconds off. 
3821.45,That's a very brief rest. 
3823.21,So three to one is just a good example 
3825.0,would be 
30,seconds on 
10,seconds off. 
3828.92,The opposite extreme on that ratio be one to five. 
3832.49,So 
20,seconds on a hundred seconds off. 
3835.36,So you do the work for 
20,seconds 
3837.49,then you rest a hundred seconds. 
3839.28,"Now, what's the difference? "
3840.43,What should you do three one ratio? 
3843.66,So 
30,seconds on 
10,"seconds off, "
3846.0,"or should you do one to five, "
3848.04,
20,seconds on to 
100,seconds off? 
3850.28,"Well, that will depend on whether or not the quality "
3854.1,of the movement is important to you. 
3856.72,So let's just take a look at the three to one ratio. 
3859.28,"So in the three to one ratio, "
3861.55,if you're going to do 
30,seconds of hard peddling 
3864.71,on a bike followed by 
10,seconds. 
3866.22,"So maybe one of these what they call assault bikes, "
3868.63,and then you stop for 
10,"seconds and then repeat, "
3871.11,"chances are you will be able to do one, two, "
3876.32,"three, four, maybe even as many as "
12,"sets, "
3879.19,if you're really in good condition 
3881.28,that you'll be able to do all those 
3882.48,because pedaling on the bike doesn't require a ton of skill. 
3885.31,"And if you do it incorrectly, "
3887.95,"if your elbow flares out a little bit or something, "
3889.83,it's very unlikely that you'll get injured 
3891.55,unless it's really extreme. 
3893.44,Okay? 
3894.273,"But the same movement done for instance, with kettlebells. "
3897.23,So 
30,seconds on 
10,seconds off. 
3900.46,The first set will probably be in good form. 
3902.21,"The second one will be in pretty good form, "
3903.96,but let's say you're getting to the fifth and sixth set 
3905.68,and you're going 
30,seconds on 
10,seconds off 
3907.77,chances are the quality of your repetitions 
3910.61,will degrade significantly. 
3911.93,And you increase the probability 
3913.26,"that you're going to get injured, "
3915.05,"or that you're going to damage in some way, "
3918.07,or that you can't complete the movement 
3920.1,or that some smaller muscles like your grip muscles 
3922.35,might give out. 
3923.76,Okay? 
3924.593,So the quality of repetitions is going to drop considerably 
3928.43,with the three to one approach. 
3930.745,If you're just doing it for effort. 
3932.63,And we'll talk about what this builds in your system 
3934.67,"in a moment, that's fine. "
3936.27,"But for most people, if quality of form is important, "
3941.34,"so maybe this is using weights, "
3943.43,maybe you're doing squats. 
3944.7,You're going to do 
20,seconds on and 
100,seconds of rest. 
3947.57,"Maybe it's even a barbell loaded squat, "
3949.32,"maybe you're doing kettlebells, "
3950.85,maybe you've got some other resistance there 
3953.96,that's allowing you to do this. 
3955.72,"What you'll find is that the longer rest, "
3957.63,even though it's 
20,"seconds of intense effort, "
3960.32,followed by a longer rest of about a hundred seconds 
3962.47,will allow you to perform more quality repetitions 
3965.58,safely over time. 
3967.81,So what does building anaerobic endurance look like? 
3972.727,"And then I'll tell you what it's actually good for, "
3975.4,in the true practical sense. 
3977.71,What anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like 
3982.44,"is that if you decide to do this for the first week, "
3985.15,"you might do this two or three times a week, "
3987.14,"maybe even just once a week, "
3988.63,"depending on the other things you're doing, "
3989.91,we'll talk about programming at the end. 
3991.85,And you would generate just three sets. 
3994.11,So it might be three sets of 
20,"seconds of hard effort, "
3997.52,followed by 
100,seconds rest. 
3999.41,Then you repeat 
20,"seconds of hard effort, "
4001.0,
100,"seconds rest, "
20,"seconds of effort, "
100,"seconds rest, "
4003.967,and you might do that twice a week. 
4006.29,"And then each week you're adding one or two sets, okay? "
4010.8,"In doing that, you will build up what we call "
4013.32,anaerobic endurance. 
4014.82,What is anaerobic endurance? 
4016.83,"Well, let's ask why we fail? "
4019.37,Anaerobic endurance is going to be taking your system 
4023.93,into greater than 
100%,of your VO
2,max. 
4028.47,It's going to be taking your heart rate up very high 
4032.37,and it's going to maximize your oxygen utilization systems. 
4037.73,That is going to have effects 
4040.3,that are going to lead to fatigue at some point 
4043.88,in the workout. 
4044.713,And that fatigue will trigger an adaptation. 
4047.24,So let's ask what adaptation it's triggering. 
4050.35,"Well, it's triggering both mitochondrial respiration, "
4055.12,the ability of your mitochondria to generate more energy 
4058.24,by using more oxygen because you're bringing so... 
4060.84,"You're maxing out, "
4061.9,literally you're getting above your VO
2,max. 
4064.23,You're hitting that threshold of how much oxygen 
4066.69,you can use in your system? 
4068.05,One of the adaptations will be that your mitochondria 
4070.72,will shift such that they can use more oxygen. 
4075.37,"And you're going to also increase the capillary beds, "
4080.08,but not as much as you're going to be able 
4082.93,to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle. 
4087.63,"So normally when we start to hit fatigue, "
4090.02,"when we're exhausted, "
4091.21,when we're breathing really hard 
4092.79,because the systems of the body are linked 
4094.41,"and we there's a component to this as well, "
4096.5,a kind of motivational component. 
4098.84,"After that third or fourth or sixth set of, "
4101.74,"you know, "
20,"seconds on a hundred seconds off, "
4103.62,or if you're at the other extreme 
30,"seconds on, "
4105.56,and 
10,seconds off. 
4106.83,There's going to be a component of you want to stop. 
4109.86,"And by pushing through and repeating another set safely, "
4112.96,of course. 
4114.07,What you're doing is you're training the neurons 
4117.46,"to be able to access more energy, literally, "
4121.15,convert that into ATP and for the muscles 
4123.43,therefore to access more energy and ATP. 
4125.96,And the adaptation is in the mitochondria's ability 
4129.52,"to use oxygen, "
4130.95,and this has tremendous carry over effects 
4133.52,for other types of exercise. 
4135.75,So while I know and appreciate 
4138.02,that people are using high intensity interval training 
4140.13,"of this kind or similar in order to just like burn fat, "
4144.7,"you know, do their workouts, quote unquote. "
4147.6,It's very useful for building a capacity to engage 
4151.84,in short bouts of effort repeatedly to really lock in. 
4156.22,I don't want to use the word focus 
4157.48,"because it's not strictly mental focus, "
4159.01,but to be able to generate short bouts of very intense work 
4164.15,this can be beneficial in competitive sports 
4166.83,"or team sports where there's a sprinting component, "
4168.88,where the field opens up and you need to dribble 
4170.48,"the ball down the field, for instance and shoot on goal. "
4173.03,"Or where you're playing tennis, "
4174.45,and it's a long rally. 
4175.68,"And then all of a sudden, somebody really starts, "
4178.6,"you know, putting you back on your heels "
4180.22,and you have to really make the maximum amount of effort 
4182.91,to run to the net and to get the ball across in that. 
4185.44,Things of that sort. 
4187.13,Okay? 
4188.24,There are a variety of places where there's carry over 
4190.33,"from this type of training, "
4191.71,but it does support endurance. 
4193.77,It's about muscle endurance. 
4195.17,It's about these muscles ability to generate a lot of force 
4198.85,"in the short-term, but repeatedly. "
4201.01,Okay? 
4201.843,So that's the way to conceptualize this. 
4203.06,And it is different than maximum power. 
4205.56,"Even though it feels like maximum effort, "
4207.68,it is not the same as building power and speed into muscles. 
4210.9,Those are distinctly different protocols. 
4213.27,So the key elements again 
4215.45,are that you're bringing your breathing 
4218.32,and your oxygen utilization way up above your max. 
4222.3,"It's not quite hitting failure, "
4224.5,but you're really pushing the system 
4226.72,to the point where you are not ready to do another set 
4229.8,and yet you begin another set. 
4231.32,You're not necessarily psychologically ready. 
4233.84,I'll talk more about some of the adaptations 
4235.66,that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes 
4239.03,when we talk about how it is that work of this sort 
4242.19,can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen 
4245.77,to our lungs and other tissues. 
4247.21,I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe 
4250.09,during these different types of protocols 
4251.91,and what's happening at the level of the heart? 
4253.41,But I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol 
4255.87,which is high intensity aerobic conditioning. 
4259.14,"So HIIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic. "
4262.2,And you just heard about anaerobic. 
4264.92,High-intensity aerobic conditioning 
4267.41,also involves about three to 
12,sets. 
4271.31,"Starting off of course, with fewer sets "
4273.62,as you're getting into this training 
4274.8,and then extending into more sets 
4277.09,as one parameter you could expand. 
4279.47,Has again the same ratio of three to one. 
4282.43,So 
30,seconds on 
10,"seconds off, "
4283.99,"or one to five, "
20,seconds on 
100,"seconds off, "
4286.77,or a very powerful tool for building up aerobic conditioning 
4290.11,is a one-to-one ratio. 
4292.85,A one-to-one ratio is powerful for building on average. 
4299.33,"Most of the energy systems involving, "
4302.05,"remember we had these nerve muscle blood, heart and lungs. "
4307.372,A one-to-one ratio might be you run a mile. 
4310.82,"And however long that takes, "
4312.14,"let's say it takes you six minutes or seven minutes, "
4314.28,then you rest for an equivalent amount of time. 
4317.56,Then you repeat. 
4319.76,And then you rest for an equivalent amount of time. 
4321.43,So you might run first mile is let's say seven minutes. 
4324.38,Then you rest for seven minutes. 
4325.47,"Then you run a mile again, "
4326.51,and it might take eight minutes 
4328.167,and you rest for eight minutes. 
4329.39,And you continue that for a total of four miles of work. 
4333.53,"Four miles of running work, I should say. "
4336.47,Or seven miles of work. 
4337.92,You can build this up. 
4339.06,Many people find that using this type of training 
4342.57,allows them to do things like go run half marathons 
4346.14,"and marathons even though prior to the race date, "
4349.6,they've never actually run a half marathon or marathon. 
4352.75,"Now, that might seem incredible. "
4354.79,"It's like how could it be that running a mile on, "
4357.68,and then resting for running a mile 
4359.66,"and then resting for an equivalent amount of time, "
4361.54,"running a mile, resting for equivalent amount time "
4363.66,for seven miles allows you to run continuously 
4366.93,for 
13,miles or for 
26,miles. 
4370.46,"Well, I'm not discouraging people "
4372.23,from ever doing the long duration endurance. 
4374.7,I think that is very important. 
4376.45,But it's because it builds up so many of these energy 
4380.63,utilization systems. 
4381.81,"It really teaches you to engage, excuse me, "
4384.65,the nerve to muscle firing. 
4386.81,It improves ATP and mitochondrial function in muscle. 
4392.31,It allows the blood to deliver more oxygen 
4395.41,to the muscle and to your brain. 
4397.94,And I'll explain how that is. 
4399.87,And it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen overall. 
4404.45,And it builds a tremendous lung capacity. 
4406.66,And we will talk about exactly how to breathe 
4408.56,and how to build lung capacity. 
4410.44,Both for sake of warming up and for performance. 
4412.73,So what would this look like? 
4413.77,And when should you do this? 
4415.96,"Well, it's really a question for these workouts "
4419.56,of asking how much work can one do in eight to 
12,"minutes, "
4423.44,right? 
4424.273,"And then rest, and then repeat. "
4425.6,How much work can you do for eight to 
12,minutes 
4427.29,then rest and then repeat? 
4428.24,And how many times should you do this? 
4430.16,"Well, this is the sort of thing it's pretty intense. "
4432.91,"And so you would probably only want to do this two, "
4436.1,maybe three times a week 
4437.27,if you're not doing many other things. 
4438.81,I will talk about how this program 
4440.39,can be moved in with other forms of training. 
4442.67,But I'll just give you a little hint now. 
4444.51,It's very clear and it's described in the review article 
4449.31,are referred to and we will link another article as well. 
4452.33,"That concurrent training, doing strength training "
4454.827,and the endurance training of any of the four kinds 
4457.32,that I'm describing today can be done. 
4459.77,You can program those in the same week. 
4461.73,But you want to get four and ideally six 
4464.98,or even better 
24,hours between these workouts. 
4468.29,"Because it is very hard, for instance, "
4470.75,to do a one-to-one mile repeats 
4473.42,"like run a mile rest for equivalent time, "
4475.107,run a mile rest for equivalent time 
4476.87,"to do that two or three times a week, "
4478.6,and also do weight training before 
4480.44,or do a long run afterwards. 
4482.38,"That would quickly lead to break down for most people, "
4485.11,"unless you have very, very good energy utilization systems. "
4488.99,"You're really kind of advanced or elite athlete, "
4492.1,and or dare I say you're using tools 
4495.51,to enhance your performance at the level of blood 
4497.71,or hormones. 
4498.543,And I'm actually going to talk about those at the end 
4500.15,and why they work? 
4501.6,So we have four kinds of endurance. 
4503.32,Muscular endurance. 
4504.38,We have long-duration endurance. 
4505.97,"We have high intensity interval training of two kinds, "
4508.14,anaerobic and aerobic. 
4509.83,"And this last type, the aerobic one works best. "
4513.35,It seems if you kind of do this one-to-one ratio. 
4515.55,So how would you use these and what are they actually doing? 
4518.35,"Let's talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen, "
4521.88,because that's something that we can all benefit 
4524.54,from understanding. 
4525.93,And it will become very clear in that discussion 
4528.67,why this type of training is very useful 
4531.3,even for non-athletes in order to improve oxygenation 
4534.83,and energy utilization of the brain and the heart. 
4538.53,The brain and the heart are probably 
4540.11,the two most important systems 
4541.47,that you need to take care of in your life. 
4543.34,"Yes, your musculature needs to be maintained. "
4546.17,"If you want to build it, that's up to you. "
4547.97,"But you should try and maintain your musculature, "
4550.07,but maintaining or enhancing a brain function 
4553.07,and cardiovascular function. 
4554.79,It's absolutely clear are key for health and longevity 
4557.785,in the short and long-term. 
4559.3,And the sorts of training I talked about today 
4561.21,has been shown again and again and again 
4563.21,to be very useful for enhancing the strength of the mind. 
4567.68,"Yes, I'll talk about that. "
4569.27,As well as the health of the brain and the body. 
4572.58,So let's talk about the sorts of adaptations 
4574.52,that are happening in your brain and body 
4576.13,that are so beneficial in these different forms of training. 
4579.98,If you are breathing hard and your heart is beating hard. 
4583.15,So this would be certainly in the high intensity 
4586.67,anaerobic and aerobic conditioning. 
4588.69,'Cause you're getting up near your VO
2,max 
4590.86,"in high intensity aerobic conditioning, "
4592.98,and you're exceeding your VO
2,max in high intensity 
4596.13,anaerobic conditioning. 
4598.72,"What's going to happen is as of course, "
4600.56,"your heart beats faster, "
4602.36,your blood is going to be circulating faster in principle. 
4607.03,Oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up 
4611.31,"and over time, not long, "
4614.14,very quickly what will happen 
4615.54,when those capillary beds start to expand? 
4617.86,We talked about that. 
4620.37,"But in addition, because of the amount of blood "
4625.34,"that's being returned to the heart, "
4627.25,when you engage in these really intense bouts 
4629.64,"of effort repeatedly, "
4632.36,the amount of blood being returned to the heart 
4634.89,actually causes an east centric loading 
4638.18,of one of the muscular walls of the heart. 
4641.53,So your heart is muscle. 
4642.68,It's cardiac muscle. 
4643.91,We have skeletal muscle attached to our bones 
4645.44,"and we have cardiac muscle, which is our heart. "
4648.39,When more blood is being returned to the heart 
4651.14,because of the additional work that your muscles 
4654.63,"and nerves are doing, "
4657.16,it actually has the effect of creating 
4659.49,"an east centric loading, a kind of pushing of the wall, "
4664.87,the left wall. 
4666.01,"I realize I'm not using the strict anatomy here, "
4668.04,but I don't want to get into all the features 
4670.01,of the structural features of the heart. 
4672.58,But the left ventricle essentially getting slammed back 
4678.03,and then having to push back 
4680.58,in a kind of east centric loading of the cardiac muscle 
4683.24,"and the muscle thickens, "
4686.41,"but not because the heart thickens overall, "
4689.06,it's actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle 
4692.01,in a way that increases what we call stroke volume. 
4695.13,Meaning as more blood is returned to the heart. 
4698.04,There's an adaptation where the heart muscle 
4700.05,actually gets stronger and therefore can pump more blood 
4704.57,per stroke per beat. 
4706.4,"And as it does that, it delivers "
4709.89,because blood contains glucose and oxygen and other things. 
4714.13,It delivers more fuel to your muscles 
4716.4,which allows you to do yet more work per unit time. 
4720.16,Okay? 
4720.993,"So when we hear that, oh, you know, so-and-so "
4723.04,has a or maybe you have a nice low heart rate 
4726.81,that maybe you're one of these really extreme folks 
4729.01,like 
30,or 
40,"beats per minute, "
4730.64,although most people are sitting at 
"50,",
"60,",
"70,",
"80,",
4733.14,that's your resting heart rate. 
4734.72,If you exercise regularly 
4736.21,"and you do long duration aerobic work, "
4739.04,"your heart rate will start to go down, "
4741.82,your resting heart rate. 
4742.89,It will increase the stroke volume of your heart. 
4745.41,If you do this high intensity type training 
4747.6,where your heart is beating very hard. 
4749.37,So maybe the one-to-one ratio mile run repeats 
4752.8,that I described a minute ago. 
4754.08,Let's say you do that twice a week for three or four. 
4757.27,"And I said, it could go all the way up to "
12,"rep sets, "
4760.13,which is a lot. 
4760.963,I don't recommend people start there. 
4762.56,"Pretty soon, the stroke volume of your heart "
4765.22,will really increase. 
4766.34,"And as a consequence, you can deliver more fuel "
4768.9,"to your muscles and to your brain, "
4771.49,and you will notice that you can do more work 
4775.49,meaning you can do the same work you were doing a few days 
4777.64,or weeks ago with relative ease. 
4780.23,Your cognitive functioning will improve. 
4782.93,"This has been shown again and again, "
4784.82,because there's an increase in vasculature. 
4787.0,"Literally, capillary beds within the brain, "
4788.87,"the hippocampus areas that support memory, "
4791.54,"but also areas of the brain that support respiration, "
4794.7,"that support focus, "
4795.89,that support effort. 
4797.36,"This isn't often discussed, "
4798.66,but the ability to deliver more blood 
4800.83,"and therefore more glucose, "
4802.31,remember neurons run on glucose and oxygen to the brain 
4805.7,is a big feature of why exercise of the kind 
4808.81,of describing helps with brain function. 
4811.84,"Now, weight training does have some positive effects "
4815.67,on brain function also. 
4816.99,"When I say weight training, I'm really... "
4818.98,I should be more specific. 
4820.2,I really am referring to strength and hypertrophy training. 
4823.46,Strength and hypertrophy training 
4825.64,especially if it's of the sort where you get into the burn 
4828.42,as we talked about last episode 
4829.7,and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal 
4832.13,"that can benefit your brain, et cetera. "
4834.01,It can have positive effects on the brain. 
4836.69,"And frankly, there haven't been as many studies "
4838.93,of resistance training strength 
4840.577,"and hypertrophy training on brain function, "
4843.06,mainly because most of those experiments 
4845.13,"are done in mice or primates, non-human primates, "
4848.67,I should say. 
4849.503,And it's hard to get mice to do resistance training. 
4853.06,Okay? 
4853.893,It's hard to get humans to do resistance training. 
4855.25,It's definitely hard to get mice to do resistance training. 
4857.14,"There are ways to do it, "
4858.16,"but it's hard to get them to do say, you know, "
4860.63,three sets of eight on the deadlift and then do some curls 
4863.58,and then do some chin-ups and this kind of thing. 
4865.5,Okay? 
4866.453,It's pretty easy to get a mouse to run on a treadmill 
4868.55,and you can set the tension on that treadmill 
4870.98,to make it so that it's easier or harder for the mouse 
4873.78,to turn that wheel. 
4875.54,So that's one of the reasons. 
4877.47,"However, it's very clear "
4879.57,and you should now understand intuitively 
4881.58,why the kind of standard strength and hypertrophy 
4884.55,type workouts are not going to activate 
4888.02,the blood oxygenation and the stroke volume increases 
4891.7,for the heart that the sorts of training 
4893.71,I'm talking about today will. 
4895.41,It just doesn't have the same positive effects. 
4898.73,"Now, that isn't to say that if you just weight train "
4901.08,that you'll be dumb or that you'll lose your memory 
4904.0,"over time, you might, "
4905.37,but it is to say that endurance work 
4908.6,in particular the high intensity 
4910.63,and long duration work that I've talked about today. 
4913.12,The two high intensity protocols 
4914.48,and the long duration work has been shown 
4916.95,"again and again and again, "
4918.55,to have positive effects on brain function. 
4920.81,"Not through the addition of new neurons, "
4922.58,"sorry to break it to you, "
4924.06,but that's not a major event in the exercised 
4927.18,"or non-exercised human brain, "
4930.13,for reasons we can talk about in a future episode. 
4932.64,But it still has many positive effects 
4935.08,through the delivery of things like IGF-
"1,",
4937.85,but also just through plain oxygenation of the brain 
4941.71,and the way it promotes the development of microvasculature 
4945.74,"to develop, to excuse me, "
4947.21,to deliver new neurons more nutrients. 
4950.05,"If neurons don't get oxygen and glucose, they do die. "
4953.49,Unless there's another fuel source like ketones 
4956.22,which can replace the glucose. 
4958.9,"If you don't give oxygen to neurons, "
4961.31,"if you don't deliver enough to them, "
4963.24,"you get what's called ischemia, "
4964.55,you get little micro strokes. 
4966.01,So the type of exercise I'm talking about today 
4968.93,in generating intense heart rate increases 
4972.04,provided that safe for you to do. 
4974.04,"Breathing hard, "
4975.03,"that's going to deliver oxygen in blood, "
4976.7,increase stroke volume of the heart 
4979.31,and is going to improve brain function 
4981.98,"has been supported by many, many quality "
4983.93,peer-reviewed studies. 
4985.6,So that's one form of positive adaptation. 
4988.85,I also talked about just sort of performance adaptations. 
4991.18,How doing high intensity aerobic conditioning 
4993.7,of the mile repeats type training can actually 
4997.04,improve your ability to do long bouts of intense work. 
5000.84,It also seems like it dovetails 
5003.49,or is compatible with resistance training 
5006.07,that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy. 
5008.44,"Now, in full disclosure the data seemed to indicate "
5011.36,"that if people just weight train or train for strength, "
5013.98,"so three reps, rest five minutes, "
5017.04,"three reps of heavyweights, et cetera. "
5018.58,"Yeah, you'll get much stronger than you would "
5020.99,if you're doing things like five repetitions up to 
"12,",
5024.65,or 
12,to 
25,reps and you're going out for long jogs. 
5028.38,"There's always going to be a compromise in adaptations, "
5030.89,unfortunately 
5031.94,It does seem like you can do concurrent training 
5033.97,"as I mentioned before, if you allow anywhere "
5035.81,from four to six or ideally 
24,hours between workouts. 
5039.64,"As I mentioned in the previous episode, "
5041.24,if you want to know if you are recovered from a workout? 
5044.35,A great way to do that is to apply 
5045.93,"the carbon dioxide tolerance test, "
5048.08,"which is four breaths in and out, "
5049.66,"inhale, exhale, inhale exhale, "
5051.01,"inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, "
5052.42,then a big inhale and then a slow controlled exhale. 
5056.04,If that slow controlled exhale is 
60,"seconds or longer, "
5060.44,"it means that your parasympathetic, "
5062.12,your calming nervous system is under your control. 
5064.73,"And it's likely, I should say likely "
5066.6,that systemically your whole nervous system has recovered 
5069.36,from whatever it is that you've been doing 
5070.82,and experiencing in life including work in relationships. 
5073.48,"If not, you might want to take a rest day, dare I say. "
5077.78,Or Costello's on is what? 
5080.35,He's 
10,now. 
5081.27,I think he's on his 
"12,",
000,thrust day. 
5084.66,"Most people need I should say, "
5086.8,one to two full rest days per week. 
5089.0,I know there are people going to say 
5089.99,"that's ridiculous and okay, "
5091.42,"maybe you have amazing recovery abilities, "
5095.0,also depends on training intensity. 
5096.5,Many people benefit from having one or two 
5098.28,full rest days per week. 
5099.89,"At least one, some people don't need to. "
5102.31,But if you are not able to extend that exhale 
5106.31,on the carbon dioxide tolerance test past 
60,"seconds or so, "
5110.6,
45,"seconds, "
60,"seconds chances are, "
5114.09,"your so-called sympathetic nervous system, "
5116.11,your stress system is chronically elevated 
5118.29,and you're not really putting the brake 
5120.34,on that system enough. 
5121.57,And that's a subconscious thing. 
5123.21,"There are ways that you can accelerate recovery, "
5125.74,but I would encourage you to listen to the previous episode. 
5128.14,It's time-stamped for how to assess recovery. 
5130.89,So how often to program these things 
5132.49,will depend on the other things you're doing. 
5134.67,I think it's perfectly reasonable 
5136.04,to do this type of training with other types of training. 
5139.38,And I'll talk about a variety of combinations of those 
5141.96,toward the end of the episode. 
5144.26,I do want to talk about how to deliver more energy 
5147.21,and oxygen. 
5148.68,"These are tools that are extremely useful, "
5151.33,I believe and that are grounded in physiology. 
5154.45,"That three things I'd like to talk about, "
5157.04,are how to breathe? 
5159.26,What to do immediately after training and hydration? 
5163.9,And I promise I will get back into programming 
5166.45,"and sort of protocols, "
5167.55,but these are vitally important to your ability 
5169.666,to perform endurance work in particular. 
5173.66,And they are grounded in how neurons and blood 
5177.44,and oxygen and your heart work together. 
5179.67,So let's first talk about breathing or respiration. 
5183.92,"We breathe a couple of different ways, "
5185.59,but let's just remind ourselves why we breathe? 
5187.41,"We breathe to bring oxygen into our system, "
5190.08,and we breathe to get rid of carbon dioxide. 
5192.5,And we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide 
5195.45,in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work. 
5199.03,It's not the oxygen is good and carbon oxide is bad. 
5202.4,They have to be present in the appropriate ratios. 
5205.3,So one thing that is very clear is our ability 
5209.08,to deliver oxygen to working muscles enter our brain 
5213.02,is going to be important for our ability 
5215.71,to generate muscular effort 
5217.38,"especially of a kind of what I was talking about today, "
5219.53,but also weight training and other forms 
5221.29,"of skill-based effort, et cetera. "
5223.07,And our ability to think. 
5224.87,"If you're holding your breath for too long, "
5226.36,"if you're breathing too much, "
5227.99,"if you're what they call over-breathing or under breathing, "
5230.15,"if you're shallow breathing, "
5231.14,"if you're mouth breathing, "
5232.07,these are all things that can really impede mental 
5235.3,and physical performance. 
5236.19,So let's make it really simple 
5237.82,and then I promise to do a future episode all about recipes. 
5241.243,There are two main sources of air for your body 
5244.9,and it's air coming in through your nose 
5246.32,and air coming in through your mouth. 
5247.67,In general nasal breathing is better. 
5250.79,It scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses. 
5254.58,You have a microbiome in your nose that benefits. 
5257.64,"There are a number of reasons, "
5258.87,"it's also just a more efficient system believe it or not, "
5261.31,even though it feels like you can gulp more air 
5262.91,with your mouth. 
5263.91,Getting good at nasal breathing is useful. 
5267.95,A gear - System of the type that Brian McKenzie 
5270.26,"and colleagues have developed, "
5271.37,I think is a good way to conceptualize this. 
5272.97,"If you're doing long duration work, "
5274.89,try and do it all nasal breathing. 
5276.46,"If you have deviated septum, "
5278.07,it's probably cause you don't nasal breathe enough. 
5281.43,Mouth breathing is something that many people suffer from. 
5286.02,You are more prone to infections. 
5287.78,"It's not as efficient, et cetera. "
5289.56,There is a place for mouth breathing. 
5290.91,"However, it's usually, if you need to do a strong exhale, "
5296.15,"oftentimes you can discard more volume through the mouth, "
5299.58,unless you're very trained at nasal breathing. 
5302.0,"So if you're doing high intensity training, "
5303.85,a good way to conceptualize this is to exhale 
5306.9,"on the max effort, "
5308.79,and then to inhale on the less intense part. 
5312.9,"So that might be as you're generating the movement, "
5315.89,"you know, you're in the concentric part of the movement "
5317.84,"you exhale, right? "
5319.46,"Just like on a bat swing or something like that, "
5321.73,or fighters and martial artists 
5324.12,do this differently depending on how they were trained 
5326.18,"and their different purposes, "
5327.14,"but they kind of like huh or ssh, "
5329.04,they kind of exhaling during the effort 
5331.44,and then inhaling on the portion of the repetition 
5334.86,that is not the highest effort portion. 
5337.41,Usually that's the eccentric phase 
5339.64,of anything involving or rowing and things of that sort. 
5344.14,"So nasal breathing is great, "
5347.05,"but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work, "
5349.5,you will need to incorporate the mouth. 
5350.79,So a gear system would look something 
5352.08,like first gear would be just nasal breathing 
5354.25,or second gear would also be just nasal breathing. 
5356.4,"But with more effort, third gear again, "
5358.66,power speed endurance has a lot more about this. 
5360.46,You can go to their website. 
5361.88,I think it's a very intelligent way to conceptualize this. 
5366.03,"As you go into more max effort, "
5368.21,then you're going to third and fourth and fifth gear. 
5370.5,And at some point you're not thinking about nose or mouth. 
5372.8,You're just trying to hang on for dear life 
5374.42,and complete the work safely. 
5376.24,And that means breathe through 
5378.2,whatever orifice works for you. 
5381.73,"So that's one aspect, nose versus mouth. "
5385.25,"The other aspect is whether or not you're using your ribs, "
5388.71,the intercostal muscles are these muscles 
5390.65,that the Bruce Lee had these remarkable intercostal muscles 
5394.99,that allow you to lift the rib cage or the diaphragm 
5398.7,which is a skeletal muscle that sits below the lungs. 
5400.81,"Just to remind you, when you inhale, "
5402.13,"the diaphragm moves down, "
5403.2,"when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up. "
5407.19,Okay? 
5408.58,Here's something that most people don't do 
5411.37,and would benefit tremendously from. 
5412.92,And I can say this because Andy Galpin's lab 
5414.84,has done work on this exploring how warming up 
5418.68,the intercostals and the nerve to diaphragm pathways 
5421.7,before any kind of endurance work 
5424.13,or in the first few minutes of endurance work 
5426.43,can allow you to breathe more deeply 
5428.88,"and to deliver more oxygen to the blood, "
5431.569,"[burps] excuse me, "
5433.13,and to the muscles and to be able to do more work 
5436.81,more efficiently. 
5437.9,"So what that involves is sometimes sitting, "
5440.37,sometimes standing and just really concentrating 
5442.42,on two things. 
5443.59,We always hear about how we should diaphragmatic breathe. 
5446.17,And that means that our belly moves out when we inhale. 
5449.01,"So [inhales deeply] our stomach expands, "
5451.37,but also expanding the intercostals 
5454.22,"which means actually raising the ribs, chest breathing. "
5456.7,We're all told that in yoga class 
5458.37,"don't breathe with your chest this, [inhales deeply]. "
5460.63,But actually that is warming up the intercostal muscles. 
5464.51,So this is also a great way to generate adrenaline 
5467.24,if you do it a little bit intensely. 
5469.43,"So let's say you're feeling unmotivated to train, "
5472.29,I don't particularly like doing endurance training 
5474.85,until I'm actually doing it. 
5477.56,So I use and benefit from having a practice 
5480.45,where I'll just sit there and for about three minutes 
5482.23,I'll just breathe very deeply trying to raise my chest 
5484.6,"as much as I can for maybe a minute, "
5486.48,and then contracting my diaphragm 
5489.94,and expanding my stomach outward when I inhale. 
5492.41,By the end of that you're actually delivering more oxygen 
5495.11,to your system. 
5497.07,My lab has looked at this in a totally different context. 
5499.66,Andy's lab has looked at it in the context 
5501.4,of physical performance. 
5503.74,"So warming up the breathing muscles should make sense, "
5507.33,given that you now know that muscles and neurons 
5510.28,need glucose and they need oxygen in order to function. 
5513.88,And so that's a great warmup. 
5514.93,You can also do this while walking 
5516.74,"or while getting on the bike and starting to peddle, "
5519.13,really starting to think about warming up 
5521.53,the breathing system. 
5522.95,And then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal 
5525.1,or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on. 
5528.85,So that's something that we don't often hear about. 
5530.41,The other one. 
5531.72,"The other tool, rather that I talked about "
5533.84,"in a previous episode, I'll just mention again, "
5535.33,is some people when they do endurance type work 
5537.66,they get a stitch in their side. 
5539.34,They feel like they've got a side cramp. 
5541.55,"Very rarely is it actually a skeletal muscular cramp, "
5546.88,it's oftentimes it's a referenced pain of the phrenic nerve 
5551.79,that innervates the liver. 
5552.9,So the phrenic nerve is responsible 
5554.3,for the movement of the diaphragm. 
5557.36,"It is a very important system, "
5559.08,but it has a number of what we call collateral. 
5561.32,So it branches to other organs. 
5563.12,Runs over other organs. 
5564.84,Sometimes when we're breathing shallow 
5566.82,and we are in physical motion 
5568.57,"and we're engaging in physical effort, "
5570.37,we'll feel that side stitch. 
5571.75,"And we think, oh, I've got a cramp or maybe I'm dehydrated "
5574.1,"or maybe I need to run with my hands over my head, "
5577.01,excuse me. 
5577.97,"Typically, you can relieve that side cramp, "
5580.52,which isn't a cramp at all. 
5581.71,"That side stitch by doing the double inhale, exhale, "
5584.62,really breathing deeply. [inhales deeply] 
5586.71,And then sneaking a little bit more air in. 
5589.83,That's a double kind of firing 
5592.35,or what we call volume of action potential 
5594.48,"sent from the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm, "
5598.07,"which will also activate that collateral, "
5600.6,that branch literally of the nerve 
5602.52,that innervates the liver. 
5603.97,"And then when you exhale, "
5606.32,"you offload a bunch of carbon dioxide, "
5608.18,"but if you repeat that a few times often, "
5611.79,"in fact, for me every time but often what'll happen "
5614.01,is that side stitch will just naturally disappear. 
5616.33,Just means you're not breathing properly. 
5618.07,You're the phrenic nerve is firing in a way 
5620.84,that's kind of aggravating that referenced pain. 
5623.49,There's nothing kind of voodoo or mysterious about this. 
5625.95,It just has to do with the way that the different nerves 
5628.78,travel in the body. 
5630.26,So as you set out on your run 
5632.08,or maybe you're going to do some muscular endurance work 
5634.88,"or high intensity work, "
5636.78,"warming up the intercostals, "
5638.62,warming up the diaphragm is good. 
5641.16,And there are exercises and there is work 
5643.89,that you can do to strengthen the intercostals 
5646.38,and to strengthen the diaphragm 
5648.48,during bouts of this kind of effort. 
5650.24,And I would say that one of the ways 
5652.06,that you can do that best is by really focusing 
5654.737,on getting the maximum diaphragmatic expansion 
5659.21,and chest lifting. 
5660.7,"What we're all told now not to do, "
5661.96,"you know, don't chest breathe, belly breathe. "
5663.84,The intercostals are there for a reason 
5665.64,and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs. 
5667.317,And they work best when they collaborate 
5669.12,with your diaphragm. 
5670.24,But when you are starting to fatigue 
5672.78,to start to really inhale deeply 
5675.1,and try and really expand those to deliver 
5676.78,more oxygen to your system. 
5679.31,While we're talking about delivering more oxygen 
5681.23,"to your system, "
5682.27,I want to share with you a useful tool 
5684.07,"that will now make total sense mechanistically why it works, "
5687.07,which is oftentimes when we are on a long run 
5691.07,or in long duration bouts of effort. 
5694.5,"We will hit the so-called wall, right? "
5697.06,We will bonk. 
5697.893,"I think they used to call it, "
5699.21,do they still call it that Costello? 
5700.76,He's asleep. 
5702.41,We bonk. 
5703.243,"Where we just we think no, we can't continue. "
5705.84,It's a curious thing as to whether or not that's neural 
5708.75,"or whether or not it's fuel-based, "
5710.76,there's certainly going to be a psychological 
5712.94,or motivational component. 
5714.49,"But one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear, "
5717.83,the capacity to push on is by understanding the way 
5720.21,that different muscle fibers use energy differently. 
5724.47,Remember the fast-twitch phosphocreatine system 
5726.917,and the slow twitch system that relies mainly 
5728.91,on lipids and glucose. 
5730.47,"Okay, well, even if you don't remember all that, "
5732.4,if you've been running steadily for a long time 
5734.017,and you're starting to fatigue 
5735.46,and you feel like it's time to quit. 
5738.52,You may have not tapped into an alternative fuel source. 
5741.74,One thing that you can do is you can actually 
5743.6,increase your speed. 
5745.2,This is also true of work where you're doing repetitions 
5748.87,with kettlebells or something. 
5749.94,You can start to increase your speed. 
5751.7,"So run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster "
5755.78,not all out sprint. 
5757.67,"But in doing that, you're shifting the the muscles "
5760.4,and the nerves over towards utilizing a separate fuel source 
5763.8,or a distinct fuel source. 
5765.74,Maybe the phosphocreatine system 
5767.2,"if it's a quick about of intense acceleration, "
5770.46,or maybe it's a combination of lipids and carbohydrates 
5774.04,in your system that weren't available to you prior. 
5777.11,"Now, of course, if you completely deplete "
5778.53,"your liver glycogen, "
5779.363,"you completely deplete everything, "
5781.4,you're only going to be running on stored fuel and fats 
5784.2,"and eventually you'll start metabolizing protein, "
5787.28,muscles themselves. 
5788.82,"But this is a kind of a unique way to realize that, "
5793.59,"oh, you weren't out of energy at all, "
5796.58,you're just over-relying on one fuel source. 
5799.02,"And this is the reason why, "
5800.53,especially elite athletes are starting to both rely 
5803.34,on carbohydrates. 
5804.173,So they're doing the whole carb depletion 
5805.71,then carb loading thing. 
5806.78,They're loading up their liver and their muscles 
5808.35,with plenty of glycogen by eating pastas and rice 
5810.994,and stuff before races. 
5811.879,"But they are also ingesting ketones during races, "
5816.93,"during long bouts of effort, "
5818.47,because ketones can be a quick form of energy. 
5820.7,There's no reason why you can't use ketones 
5822.64,if they are taking exogenous ketones and carbohydrate. 
5826.11,"And in combination, remember the body is accustomed "
5828.73,"to using multiple fuel sources, fatty acids, carbohydrates "
5832.36,all these things. 
5833.193,"It's only in the, you know, of internet age "
5835.78,"that we think in terms of, "
5837.17,"oh, well you're either keto or you're burning sugar, "
5840.75,or you're fat adapted or key or fat fasting 
5844.73,or fast fasting or fat fatting. 
5846.992,Costello woke up when I said fat fatting. 
5848.8,I'm not talking about you Costello. 
5850.31,So the point is that your body 
5852.19,is used to using multiple fuel sources. 
5853.78,"So if you're kind of hitting that wall, "
5855.7,sometimes accelerating can actually allow you to tap 
5858.62,into a new fuel source or combination of fuel sources 
5861.08,just based on the way that muscles use fuel. 
5863.78,So that's another tool. 
5865.53,The other thing that's really important to think about 
5867.2,in terms of endurance type work is hydration. 
5870.55,And I think hydration is important for all forms 
5873.13,of physical work and exercise not just endurance. 
5876.19,The deal with hydration is that we've been taught 
5880.56,about hydration all wrong. 
5881.99,But let's remember what neurons work on? 
5885.05,What do they use in order to fire? 
5886.93,"Well, they certainly need water, right? "
5890.67,"We need water in our system, I should say. "
5892.91,"But remember they use electrolytes, "
5894.7,sodium and potassium to generate those action potentials 
5897.06,"to actually get neurons to contract, "
5898.87,"to be able, excuse me, muscles to contract "
5900.8,and for our brain to function and to be able to think. 
5906.03,"Typically, we're going to lose anywhere "
5908.19,from one to five pounds of water per hour of exercise. 
5912.21,"And that's going to vary tremendously, "
5913.7,"it's going to vary on weather, "
5915.5,"it's going to vary on intensity, "
5917.41,"probably more like five pounds, "
5919.02,if it's hot day and you're exercising very intensely. 
5923.1,So about one to five pounds per hour. 
5926.23,"Now, you know how much you weigh. "
5928.69,"So if you think about your weight in pounds, "
5932.62,once you lose about one to 
4%,"of your body weight in water, "
5938.08,you're going to experience about a 
20,to 
30%,reduction 
5941.87,in work capacity. 
5942.89,"In your ability to generate effort of any kind, "
5947.34,"strength, endurance, et cetera. "
5949.85,You are also going to experience a significant drop 
5952.45,in your ability to think and perform mental operations. 
5955.58,So hydration is key. 
5956.813,"Now, many people have been told, "
5958.54,"well, if you urinate and your urine is clear, "
5961.81,"well, then you're hydrated enough. "
5963.52,Sometimes that's true. 
5964.72,Sometimes that's not true. 
5966.33,"Also and this isn't a topic I enjoyed discussing, "
5969.7,but a urine is a biological phenomenon. 
5972.709,It's actually filtered blood every once in a while 
5976.77,"and if there's a kid and it's a family friend, "
5978.46,"I'll say, ""Did you know that your pee "
5979.777,"""is actually filtered blood?"" "
5981.097,And they usually kind of go wide-eyed. 
5982.71,"But then they go, ""Oh, that's kind of cool."" "
5984.04,Like kids have this natural curiosity 
5985.72,about blood and pee and stuff. 
5987.61,That's not contaminated by our preconceived notions 
5991.19,"of those things being gross, "
5993.57,because you're in being filtered blood 
5996.4,can give you some indication as to whether 
5998.47,or not you're hydrated enough or not. 
6001.05,"And in order to really assess that, "
6003.57,it's not going to be sufficient to urinate 
6006.43,into another volume of water and assess 
6008.5,whether or not your urine is very dark or very light. 
6010.27,It actually requires urinating into a small volume 
6012.53,"and saying, well, is it darker or lighter than before? "
6015.05,It's not something you really want to do most places. 
6019.52,The etiquette of most gyms and environments 
6022.29,is not suitable for that. 
6023.81,But one of the things that you can just do 
6026.7,"is you configure, "
6027.533,"well, I'm going to lose one to five pounds of water per hour. "
6030.86,You can show up to exercise reasonably hydrated 
6035.74,with electrolytes. 
6036.91,"So potassium, sodium and magnesium are really key. "
6039.31,"Yes, it's true, you can die from drinking too much water "
6042.21,"in particular because it forces you, "
6044.5,"if you drink too much water, "
6045.71,you excrete too many electrolytes 
6047.42,and your brain will shut off. 
6049.08,You'll actually your heart will stop functioning properly. 
6051.54,"So you don't want to over consume to the extreme either, "
6054.8,but there are a number of equations 
6057.28,that go into figuring out how much water you need 
6059.59,"based on how intense your training, et cetera, "
6062.04,"body size, et cetera. "
6062.99,"Just remember you burn, you lose, excuse me "
6065.55,"about one to five pounds of water per hour, "
6068.58,"depending on how hot it is, "
6069.413,and how intensely you're exercising. 
6071.34,Once your body weight drops by one to 
4%.,
6074.32,"So you can just figure, "
6075.6,"well, if you lose five pounds per hour, "
6077.81,you exercise for two hours. 
6080.12,Let's say you're about 
200,"pounds, "
6081.52,that's about 
10%.,
6082.93,Okay? 
6083.763,"Well, you want to replace that before you very quickly or not. "
6087.49,You want to replace that all along 
6089.14,before you start experiencing 
6090.57,this massive 
20,to 
30%,reduction in work capacity of muscles 
6093.89,and the brain. 
6094.723,A simple formula. 
6096.08,"What I call it, the Galpin equation. "
6098.12,"Hereafter, referred to as the Galpin equation "
6101.26,is a formula that gets you close to the exact amount 
6104.59,"that you would want that Dr. Andy Galpin came up with, "
6107.51,which is your body weight in pounds 
6110.13,divided by the number 
30.,
6112.2,And that is how many ounces you should drink 
6114.22,for every 
15,minutes of exercise. 
6117.31,"So once again, the Galpin equation. "
6119.62,Your body weight in pounds divided by 
30.,
6123.49,"That's the amount of fluid to drink in ounces, right? "
6129.69,Every 
15,minutes of exercise. 
6132.42,"Now, if you are sweating a lot, "
6133.88,you may need more. 
6135.06,Okay? 
6135.893,"If you're already very well hydrated, "
6137.8,"you may need less, "
6139.12,but that's a good rule of thumb to begin 
6141.999,and to start to understand the relationship 
6144.81,between hydration and performance. 
6147.49,"There is a phenomenon in which gastric emptying, "
6152.25,"the ability to move stuff out of your gut, "
6154.45,including water and electrolytes out of your gut 
6157.44,and into the bloodstream and for delivery 
6159.9,to the tissues of your body for effort 
6161.92,is hindered when you get above 
70%,of your VO
2,max. 
6165.38,In other words when you're doing high intensity training 
6168.47,sometimes people experience that ingesting water 
6172.16,during intense training is difficult. 
6174.94,It is something that can be actually trained up. 
6177.94,It's a matter of learning to kind of relax 
6180.84,your abdominal muscles. 
6182.73,And there's some other aspects of adaptation 
6185.68,that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work. 
6189.38,"As Galpin says, don't try and ingest fluids "
6194.027,when you're working out or competing 
6196.95,at higher than 
70%,of VO
2,max 
6198.84,if you've never done it before. 
6199.86,You want to train up this capacity. 
6201.93,People can learn how to consume fluids during a race 
6204.38,or consume fluids during bouts of exercise 
6207.06,that are very intense. 
6208.79,"And a lot of people don't want to do that, "
6210.44,"'cause they don't want to have to stop to urinate, et cetera. "
6212.75,But given the crucial role of hydration 
6215.5,"for muscular performance and for brain performance, "
6218.64,it seems that if you're going to be doing a lot 
6220.66,of high intensity interval training 
6222.79,of the various concepts talked about today 
6225.17,or high intensity training of any kind 
6226.96,that hydration is key and learning 
6229.04,"or in other words, getting your system to adapt "
6231.18,to ingesting fluids in the middle of these workouts 
6233.63,is something that seems beneficial. 
6235.66,"At least to me, in terms of the trade off "
6238.29,between being dehydrated and the somewhat discomfort 
6241.35,of maybe drinking some fluids. 
6242.47,So you sip small amounts of fluid initially 
6244.67,and then you're able to take bigger and bigger gulps 
6246.68,as time goes on. 
6247.513,"And pretty soon you're able to drink mid-set or be, "
6251.71,"excuse me, not mid-set. "
6253.11,Please don't do that between sets and your workout 
6255.12,or while you're still breathing hard after a mile repeat 
6257.41,or something of that sort without much disruption 
6260.01,or any at all to your performance. 
6262.04,Last episode we talked about how to assess recovery 
6265.26,"and things that you might want to do to improve recovery, "
6268.22,how exposure to ice baths 
6269.76,and cold showers can reduce inflammation 
6271.62,"which can be great for recovery, "
6273.55,but can inhibit some of the adaptations 
6276.7,for strength and hypertrophy. 
6277.97,Because inflammation isn't good or bad. 
6280.54,Inflammation isn't like a nice person or a mean person. 
6283.94,It's both. 
6284.88,"It's a great thing for stimulating adaptations, "
6288.6,but you don't want it around too long. 
6290.33,And so we suggested that you not do ice baths 
6292.46,within probably six hours of any training 
6295.66,where the goal was hypertrophy or strength training. 
6298.77,There is some evidence that getting yourself 
6300.9,into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance training 
6304.93,can actually improve the mitochondrial aspects 
6309.99,of endurance exercise that you can get improvements 
6312.81,"in mitochondrial density, "
6314.8,and you can get improvements in mitochondrial respiration 
6318.76,by doing that afterwards 
6320.05,and that it can facilitate recovery. 
6322.12,That's still a bit of a controversial area. 
6324.82,I do think that what I mentioned earlier 
6326.4,that waiting at least six hours 
6327.76,and probably more like 
24,hours between workouts 
6330.63,is a good idea. 
6331.463,"That getting at least one full day of rest each week, "
6334.34,for some people that'll be two. 
6335.61,I have to say I'm one of these people 
6337.21,"that after two days of absolutely no exercise, "
6340.1,I do perform better consistently across all aspects 
6343.4,of physical performance and mentally I feel better as well 
6346.79,even though I load to take those days off 
6349.16,unless I'm really exhausted 
6351.2,it does seem to help my training. 
6353.23,Some people can train seven days a week and they're fine. 
6355.24,I think it just is there's a lot of individual variation. 
6357.86,You want to work on sleep and maximizing sleep 
6359.81,"for recovery nutrition, of course, as well. "
6362.84,I talked about sleep in the first four episodes 
6366.4,of the podcast. 
6367.233,If you have trouble with sleep 
6368.77,definitely check out those episodes. 
6371.13,It's very clear and a number of sports teams 
6374.75,"even some folks that I work with, "
6376.84,and Andy Galpin and others are starting to incorporate 
6380.11,a what's called a parasympathetic down-regulation 
6382.63,after training of any kind as a way to accelerate recovery 
6385.54,and enable you to do more work. 
6387.46,"In other words, get back to work out sooner. "
6389.54,What is parasympathetic downregulation? 
6390.61,It means finishing your training 
6393.63,and instead of just hopping on the phone 
6395.88,or hopping into your car 
6397.4,"and heading off to take five minutes minimum, "
6400.67,maybe ideally more like 
10,or 
"20,",
6402.79,but for sake of time five minutes minimum 
6405.22,and doing just some slow pure nasal long exhale breathing 
6410.31,or lying down and just kind of zoning out. 
6413.11,That it seems can accelerate recovery 
6415.85,"and allow you to get back into other types of work, "
6419.04,mental work or physical work more quickly 
6421.26,which makes total sense because remember your nervous system 
6425.42,and recovery and work is a local phenomenon 
6428.58,which muscles were you using. 
6429.87,"You know, were you using your glutes, "
6431.43,your hams and your back 
6433.11,"or were using your shoulders, et cetera. "
6434.73,But it's also a systemic thing. 
6436.51,It's also about those neurons 
6437.65,in the locus coeruleus that are releasing epinephrine 
6439.457,and you want to quiet all that down after training. 
6442.25,You want to really just zone out. 
6443.99,"Think Costello, channel your inner Costello, "
6446.72,and just mellow out for five to 
20,minutes 
6449.77,and then move into the rest of your day. 
6451.88,Five minutes should be manageable. 
6453.67,Even if it's just sitting in the car with your eyes closed 
6455.55,doing that downregulation breathing. 
6457.58,I think you'll see big benefits in terms 
6459.75,"of allowing yourself to come back sooner, "
6462.59,do more work over time 
6464.49,"and just perform and feel better generally, "
6467.34,as well as be able to think about other things 
6469.15,besides the just how much the previous workout 
6471.8,kind of beat you up. 
6473.7,A couple more things I think are going to be useful. 
6476.03,"And I do want to just pack these in, "
6477.81,'cause we are closing out the month on physical performance. 
6480.6,And that's about programming and about pacing 
6484.97,and the kind of mental aspects of endurance. 
6488.32,So let's start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance. 
6492.71,I learned from a friend and colleague here at the podcast 
6497.33,that... 
6498.163,Who's very active in triathlon and marathon and other... 
6500.65,Knows a lot about that whole world 
6502.31,"and the competitive landscape there, "
6504.14,that pacing and literally physical pacers 
6508.17,have a laser on the ground 
6509.51,or visualizing or having a pace car or a pace runner 
6513.68,in front is actually not allowed in many competitions. 
6517.15,And if those are present doesn't allow the race times 
6521.13,to qualify as legitimate record holding times. 
6525.67,And that's very interesting to me 
6527.42,because what we know is that the visual system 
6531.79,has this capacity to switch back and forth between 
6534.95,what we call panoramic vision 
6536.23,where we're not really focused on anything. 
6537.98,Things are just flowing past us 
6539.8,or our eyes are just kind of zoned out. 
6542.33,So I can do this right now and you won't be able to tell 
6544.64,but I'm looking at the corners of the room. 
6546.23,I see Costello down there on the floor. 
6547.85,I see my podcast team here 
6550.36,and I can also see the microphone. 
6552.63,I can see myself in this environment. 
6554.87,That's panoramic vision. 
6556.15,Whereas if I draw my eyes to one location 
6558.31,"like right there in the center of the camera, "
6560.05,it's what's called a vergence eye movement. 
6561.63,So I'm contracting my visual window. 
6563.86,"The contraction of the visual window when that's done, "
6567.17,is the same thing that would happen 
6568.38,if I was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner 
6571.35,or a laser on the ground. 
6573.32,The mere bringing our eyes together 
6575.33,to what we call a vergence point has the impact 
6579.01,of triggering the activation of neural circuits 
6581.79,in the thalamus. 
6583.08,"Things like zona incerta, "
6584.55,"if you really want to know what their names are, "
6586.12,of these brain areas. 
6586.953,As well as in the brainstem that activate 
6589.7,"the so-called alertness system, "
6591.07,"things like locus coeruleus, "
6592.43,whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us 
6595.43,into states of relaxation. 
6596.99,You can actually leverage us during your runs. 
6599.76,Let's say you're out for a long run 
6602.1,or you're swimming or you're cycling. 
6604.01,This is probably easiest to imagine out of the water 
6606.572,before I do in the water as well. 
6608.45,If you focus your attention on a landmark 
6610.64,"that you're going to run to, "
6612.37,you'll find that it's much easier 
6614.07,than if you don't actually have a set milestone 
6617.32,or landmark that you're going to run to. 
6619.34,"However, if you were to continue that repeatedly "
6621.64,"just going milestone after milestone, after milestone, "
6624.27,you would feel more mentally fatigued 
6626.54,and you would actually be able 
6627.7,to degenerate less work overall. 
6630.58,"One thing that can be useful is focusing on a milestone, "
6635.16,running to that milestone or biking 
6637.19,"whatever it is the activity happens to be, "
6638.7,and then dilating your field of view 
6640.7,to relax the system and then continuing again. 
6643.64,So it's this kind of active contraction 
6646.19,or of the visual window and then dilation 
6648.55,of the visual window. 
6649.7,Contraction of the visual window allows you to generate 
6651.84,"more effort but there's a cost to doing that, "
6653.56,because neurons consume energy. 
6655.01,And now you know how they do that. 
6656.8,Whereas dilation allows you to essentially 
6659.194,"be more efficient, right? "
6661.29,"Now, pacing is not allowed or having a pacer, a visual pacer "
6666.37,because it does allow you to access systems 
6668.74,"in the brain and body that allow you to create more energy, "
6673.01,more effort. 
6673.843,And so I find it interesting 
6674.94,that I think in a kind of subconscious genius 
6677.27,the race officials and the governing bodies 
6680.42,"of these races have said, "
6681.82,"okay, sure, having a pacer there or someone in front, "
6684.4,"you can draft off of them, "
6685.39,there's actually a kind of a aerodynamic effect 
6688.48,of having someone in front of you 
6689.41,that makes it easier to run in the wake of their airstream. 
6693.49,So to speak. 
6694.43,Same as true in cycling. 
6696.29,This is why the cycling teams are so good 
6697.92,at maneuvering and packs. 
6699.12,"In very specific ways, you can go faster with less effort "
6702.32,if you're drafting as it's called behind somebody. 
6705.23,But as well where you place your vision will allow you 
6708.7,to generate more effort. 
6710.28,And so it's interesting that they've taken out 
6712.1,"this kind of, if you will, "
6715.26,performance enhancing tool. 
6717.43,I imagine and I have to imagine 
6719.73,it's the appropriate word here. 
6721.02,"That good runners, good cyclists have the ability "
6726.21,to create a kind of pacer in their minds eye. 
6730.42,I have to imagine that they're not just completely allowing 
6732.74,"their attention to drift, "
6733.81,although they do that when they want to be in highly efficient 
6736.39,mode generating effort without having to tax 
6738.64,their mental capacity. 
6739.77,And remember mental capacity is neural energy 
6742.73,and consumes glucose energy that they could devote 
6745.48,to the functioning of their body. 
6746.99,"But that when needed that they can focus their energy in, "
6750.64,and actually kind of chase a mental pacer or pick milestone. 
6754.27,So this is a mental game that you can play as well. 
6757.41,It's a little bit hard to do in the context of weightlifting 
6759.79,in the gym. 
6760.623,"It's more of a moving through space kind of thing, "
6762.7,"but some people do this by counting reps, et cetera. "
6766.01,I think it's especially suitable for endurance type 
6769.82,"of exercise, especially done outside. "
6772.18,One of the reasons I hate running on a treadmill 
6774.01,is it just feels like it's never ending. 
6776.02,And I've never tried one of these Peloton things. 
6778.09,I try and avoid looking at screens 
6779.45,as much as I possibly can. 
6781.21,But if you try this next time you're out for a run 
6783.43,or a swim. 
6784.263,What you'll find is that you have a capacity 
6785.72,to engage a system of higher energy output 
6789.75,"when you focus your eyes on a particular location, "
6791.68,but you want to use that judiciously 
6793.31,"because your goal of course, "
6795.0,is to become efficient at moving through space over time 
6797.66,and not taxing your brain and body to the point 
6799.89,"where you arrive at the end of that, "
6802.53,unless it's race day just completely tapped out. 
6805.67,So that's a kind of interesting aspect of running. 
6809.13,"If you're a fan of running, which I am, "
6812.02,and you get the chance to look at any of the documentaries 
6814.74,"or docu-drama has made about, [clears throat] "
6817.31,"excuse me, about Steve Prefontaine. "
6819.28,"It was clear that he was mostly in a battle with himself, "
6822.13,but that he was also a highly competitive individual. 
6824.44,And you'll see this in some of his races. 
6826.27,I do encourage you to look some of those up on YouTube 
6828.62,or see the docudramas. 
6829.76,They're quite good. 
6830.72,Where he ran the... 
6833.64,Essentially was 
12,laps on a track. 
6835.48,It's essentially the five. 
6836.615,It is the 
"5,",
000,meter race 
6837.85,where essentially three miles. 
6839.7,And he essentially tried to sprint the whole thing 
6841.94,which is ridiculous. 
6842.79,Actually knowing what you know today 
6844.05,you'll realize that Steve Prefontaine 
6845.93,"basically was pulling from strength, speed, "
6848.52,"power, muscular, endurance, "
6850.71,"long duration effort, high intensity, "
6852.54,"aerobic, anaerobic as he sort of tried "
6854.24,to maximize every fuel system. 
6856.08,"And you'll see that in the races that he runs, "
6858.7,"but that when runners are nearing the final laps, "
6862.74,"the so-called bell lap of a race, "
6864.3,they'll often look to one another to see 
6866.2,where somebody is obviously to assess their progress 
6868.98,and how close somebody is? 
6870.47,"But when somebody gets past, "
6872.91,"oftentimes you'll see someone access this mysterious kick, "
6877.3,this ability to tap into some additional gear 
6880.28,that allows them to run forward or faster 
6883.09,when they themselves actually thought 
6885.19,that they were maxed out. 
6886.7,So someone could be running for the finish line. 
6888.84,They're convinced they're going to win. 
6889.99,They're going max effort 
6891.16,or at least they perceive max effort. 
6892.5,Someone passes them. 
6893.55,"And all of a sudden max effort has changed, "
6896.25,because of that visual target 
6897.97,they are able to access higher levels 
6900.54,of speed and output and effort and performance. 
6903.06,"They don't always catch up to that person and win, "
6905.26,but having a target a milestone is a powerful way 
6909.66,that we can generate more force and energy in anything. 
6913.01,And the visual system is the way that we bring 
6915.69,"those milestones into our brain, "
6918.55,"which then brings about epinephrin, "
6920.51,"which brings about neural firing, "
6922.34,which allows us to access whatever resources 
6924.76,happen to be available to us. 
6926.55,"So I find this fascinating because people often wonder, "
6930.64,like where does the kick come from? 
6932.37,Where is this kind of gift of an additional gear? 
6935.38,Where is that deeper resource? 
6937.01,"And we often express it and talk about it, "
6939.29,in kind of psychological terms like heart or willpower 
6942.68,or that something kind of got transplanted into us 
6945.56,or descended into us. 
6946.75,And not to remove any of the spiritual aspects of sport 
6950.31,"or running or effort of the human, you know, heart. "
6954.54,But it's very clear that the nervous system 
6957.27,when it has a specific visual target 
6959.58,can generate the sorts of intense effort 
6962.77,that it couldn't otherwise. 
6964.17,And it sometimes even comes as a surprise 
6965.81,to the person generating the effort. 
6968.09,"I promised that I would talk about programming, "
6970.4,meaning when and how many times a week 
6973.968,to do the various workouts related to endurance 
6976.607,and how to merge those with other types of exercise 
6979.46,that you might be doing for strength or yoga 
6981.68,or other things that you might be doing like work 
6983.94,"and other things, unrelated to exercise. "
6986.45,Since that's a vast space with many different parameters 
6990.62,and you all have different lives and lifestyles 
6992.53,"and backgrounds with fitness, et cetera. "
6995.2,What I'm going to do is I'm going to put 
6997.22,three different levels if you will or protocols 
7000.84,that one could adopt in a link on the show notes. 
7005.79,"So in the caption on YouTube, "
7007.82,"if you click on that link, "
7008.94,you'll be able to see three possible combinations 
7012.64,"of endurance work, strength, and hypertrophy work "
7015.07,"or endurance work, flexibility and hypertrophy work "
7018.25,that are grounded in many of the major publications 
7020.96,that Dr. Andy Galpin and colleagues and other people 
7023.5,have described including this review 
7025.465,that's also linked there on concurrent training 
7028.47,"and how one can use concurrent training, "
7030.77,"meaning training for endurance, "
7032.13,"training for strength, "
7033.03,"training for hypertrophy, "
7034.22,training for all these different things 
7035.49,without having to train constantly everyday 
7037.27,"twice a day, et cetera. "
7038.96,So if you are interested in taking the protocols 
7041.83,that you learned about in this episode 
7043.577,"and in previous episodes and combining those, "
7046.21,we've placed them there for you 
7047.77,as a completely zero cost resource. 
7049.9,Please understand they are not wholly... 
7052.72,Costello agrees. 
7053.61,They are not wholly. 
7055.65,There will be variation in terms 
7056.799,of what people can tolerate and what they have time for? 
7059.74,But I think they'll serve as a useful guideline 
7061.852,in getting started or in continuing with an expanding 
7066.0,"on existing endurance work, strength work, "
7069.15,hypertrophy work and so forth. 
7071.27,Just really quickly. 
7072.103,We didn't talk about supplements much today. 
7074.32,In the previous episodes I talked about 
7076.06,"the phosphocreatine system and supplementing with creatine, "
7078.65,I talked about beta alanine 
7080.02,for kind of moderate duration work. 
7082.75,You know really the only things that have been shown 
7085.661,to really improve endurance work across the four varieties 
7091.88,of endurance work I described today. 
7094.25,They have essentially two forms. 
7096.55,"One, are stimulants. "
7097.47,So things like caffeine will definitely 
7099.68,improve endurance work and power output. 
7102.32,There's a little bit of evidence 
7103.5,that caffeine intake can actually inhibit 
7106.13,"the function of the creating system, "
7107.72,but it's just one study. 
7110.22,But that's interesting. 
7111.61,"If you want to read that study, "
7112.58,you can put caffeine into www.examine.com 
7115.43,and it will take you to that study. 
7117.41,"Many people get sore after workouts, "
7119.41,in particular workouts 
7120.5,that involve a lot of eccentric loading 
7123.56,or workouts that are very novel 
7125.19,where they've kind of pushed it instead of moving gradually 
7128.69,as I suggest into say high intensity anaerobic endurance 
7131.86,work of three sets of 
20,seconds on 
100,seconds rest. 
7135.12,Maybe you get over ambitious and you do eight sets. 
7138.09,In which case you are extremely sore. 
7140.54,"Certain forms of magnesium in particular, "
7142.34,"magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E. "
7145.28,Have been shown to be useful for removing 
7149.27,or reducing the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness. 
7152.86,That form of magnesium is distinctly different 
7154.96,than the sorts of magnesium that are good 
7156.41,for getting us into sleep. 
7157.59,Things like magnesium three and eight and Bisglycinate. 
7160.0,And then there's this whole thing about beet powder 
7164.1,and beet juices and things that increase nitric oxide 
7168.26,and allow for more vasodilation and therefore delivery 
7171.02,of blood to muscle and neurons and other tissues 
7173.36,for long bouts of endurance work. 
7174.99,Some people like beet juice and they related compounds 
7179.13,that increase arginine and vasodilation. 
7181.26,Some people don't. 
7182.61,Some people don't feel good when they take those. 
7185.34,Some people also don't feel good 
7186.51,"when they take beta alanine, "
7187.87,because it can give them this feeling 
7189.37,"of kind of like itchy, creepy crawlies under the skin "
7192.72,"kind of the niacin phenomenon, the niacin flush. "
7195.33,"Some people don't mind that, "
7196.36,or some people don't experience that. 
7198.19,So when it comes to supplementation 
7199.42,there's a lot of variety. 
7200.34,But magnesium malate has been shown to reduce soreness 
7204.24,as sometimes that's good. 
7205.66,Cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness 
7208.08,things of that sort. 
7209.21,"But in general, we focused mainly today on behavioral tools. "
7214.22,You'll notice that all of the tools are accessible 
7217.92,without the need for lots of equipment. 
7220.4,"So I didn't say you need a rower, "
7221.6,or you need a kettlebell though those will work. 
7223.9,And I hope I was able to illustrate for you that endurance 
7227.19,isn't just one thing. 
7228.26,It's not just the ability to go for long bouts of exercise 
7232.48,"of different kinds, "
7233.46,that there's also this mental component 
7235.01,because of the way that neurons work. 
7236.7,And also that there are these different forms of endurance 
7239.73,"of muscular endurance, "
7240.79,that where you're going to fail 
7241.68,'cause of the muscles and muscle energy utilization 
7245.06,and the nerves that innovate those muscles locally 
7247.11,not because of a failure to bring in oxygen or blood. 
7250.68,Whereas long duration effort. 
7252.14,"It's going to be more about, "
7253.97,"you know, being below your VO"
2,"max, "
7255.587,and your ability to be efficient for long bouts 
7258.06,of more than 
12,minutes of exercise. 
7260.21,"One set, as they say of "
12,minutes to maybe several hours. 
7264.63,I should just mention with long duration type work. 
7267.21,"You know, you could even imagine raking in the yard "
7269.34,or mowing a lawn depending on how big that lawn is. 
7271.38,I use to have job when I was a kid mowing lawns 
7273.99,"and I'll tell you, "
7275.48,"we didn't have many neighbors with very big lawns, "
7277.48,but there are a few of them felt huge 
7279.228,'cause they were really convoluted. 
7280.94,"And if you're pushing that mower, "
7282.21,and these were the old fashioned mowers 
7283.39,"not electric mowers, it's work. "
7284.77,That's also of the sort that we call long duration 
7287.25,endurance work. 
7288.45,High intensity training we'll tap 
7289.97,into yet other fuel sources and mechanisms 
7292.99,as we learned today.

7412.0,that we believe has the highest levels of stringency 
7414.37,in terms of the quality of the supplements. 
7416.75,And they are very precise and very stringent 
7419.88,about the amounts of each of those compounds 
7422.92,in the given supplements. 
7424.05,This is a huge problem elsewhere in the supplement industry. 
7427.35,Many brands don't include what they say they include 
7430.16,on the bottle. 
7430.993,It seems to show up every time people test different brands. 
7434.47,But Thorne continually tests out 
7436.58,with the highest levels of accuracy and stringency.
