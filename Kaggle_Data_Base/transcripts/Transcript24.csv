0.36,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
2.07,where we discuss science
and,science based tools
4.92,for everyday life.
9.33,"I'm Andrew Huberman,"
10.35,and I'm a professor of
neurobiology,and ophthalmology
13.29,at Stanford School of Medicine.
15.12,Today we are discussing nicotine.
17.22,Nicotine is one of the most
commonly,consumed substances
19.89,on the entire planet.
21.66,There are literally billions of people
23.76,that ingest nicotine on a daily basis.
26.67,Most of those people consume
nicotine,"via smoking,"
29.7,and in particular smoking tobacco.
31.89,Tobacco contains nicotine and it
33.66,"contains a bunch of other things as well,"
35.94,which we will talk about.
37.23,And the burning of tobacco
liberates,nicotine and makes it
39.96,accessible to the various
cells,and tissues of the body.
43.2,"But of course, there are other"
sources,of nicotine as well.
45.72,"Some people consume nicotine through dip,"
48.27,that is placing tobacco on the inside
50.34,of the lip or in the cheek.
52.86,"Some people consume nicotine via snuff,"
55.47,which is literally the
shoving,of tobacco leaves
57.75,up the nostrils and allowing the tobacco
60.51,to access the nervous
system,and other areas
63.24,of the body by permeating into the
65.4,"mucosal membranes, that is the lining,"
67.74,the soft lining of the nasal passages.
69.9,And of course there are
nicotine,"patches, nicotine gum,"
72.72,"there's nicotine in pill form,"
74.37,there are toothpicks dipped
in,"nicotine, et cetera."
77.19,Today we are going to separate
our,discussion of nicotine
79.89,from a discussion of smoking and vaping
82.26,and the other forms of
delivery,for nicotine.
84.57,We will be talking
about,smoking and vaping
87.12,and other routes of
nicotine,"administration,"
89.52,both for sake of highlighting
their,detriments to health
93.84,"and, believe it or not, in certain cases,"
97.56,"keep in mind very specific certain cases,"
100.08,the possible health benefits
of,delivering nicotine
103.08,through specific modalities.
105.6,Turns out those modalities do not
107.55,include smoking cigarettes or vaping.
110.82,And we are going to pay particular
attention,to vaping today
113.73,"because vaping use is on the rise,"
116.34,in particular in young
"people,","and vaping use,"
120.39,and the fact that most
tobacco,that's consumed
123.66,through vaping includes
quite,amount of nicotine
126.81,has created a scenario where nicotine
129.09,because of its ability to change
130.59,certain chemicals in the
brain,can actually lead to
133.77,addiction for a number of other
substances,related to vaping
137.785,and vaping associated behaviors.
139.56,If all of that seems like
a,lot to get your arms
141.9,and your mind around right here
at,"the outset, don't worry,"
144.66,"I'll walk you through this,"
146.43,regardless of whether or
not,you have a background
147.87,in biology or not.
148.98,I promise that you'll come
through,at the end of this
151.99,episode with a deep understanding
of,how nicotine works
154.32,"in the brain and body,"
some,"of its benefits,"
156.69,"some of its potential drawbacks,"
158.34,and you'll have clear optics
as,to why smoking and vaping
162.45,and other forms of nicotine
delivery,have the effects
164.97,that they do on your
biology,and psychology.
167.88,I'm pleased to announce that
the,Huberman Lab Podcast
169.77,is now partnered with
Momentous,supplements.
172.08,We partnered with Momentous
for,several important reasons.
174.33,"First of all,"
175.586,they ship internationally
because,we know that many of you
177.36,are located outside of the United States.
179.43,"Second of all, and perhaps most important,"
181.44,the quality of their
supplements,"is second to none,"
183.99,both in terms of purity and precision
185.64,of the amounts of the ingredients.
187.59,"Third, we've really emphasized supplements"
190.23,"that are single ingredient supplements,"
192.45,and that are supplied in
dosages,that allow you
195.21,to build a supplementation protocol
197.46,"that's optimized for cost,"
199.29,"that's optimized for effectiveness,"
201.21,and that you can add things
and,remove things from your
203.58,protocol in a way that's really
systematic,and scientific.
206.43,If you'd like to see the supplements
207.6,"that we've partnered with Momentous on,"
208.95,you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
212.04,There you'll see those supplements.
213.18,And just keep in mind that
we,are constantly expanding
215.64,the library of supplements
available,through Momentous
218.34,on a regular basis.
219.27,"Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman."
221.88,"Before we go any further,"
222.93,I just want to highlight a key takeaway
225.18,"from a previous episode,"
which,is our episode on focus.
228.96,And in fact was a toolkit for focus.
231.84,"So during the toolkit for focus episode,"
233.58,we talked about a large number
of,"behavioral, pharmacologic,"
235.92,and another interventions
that,you can use to increase
238.77,your level of concentration
and,"focus for whatever purpose,"
241.56,"cognitive endeavors, learning languages,"
244.2,"focusing in school, on work, et cetera,"
246.63,or physical pursuits.
248.22,Now one of the key takeaways is that
250.5,there are really two key
252.54,protocols that I believe
everyone,should understand
255.0,and know about and why they work
257.13,"because they are so effective,"
258.54,and also because they dovetail
nicely,with some of the
261.27,information that we're
going,"to talk about today,"
263.4,which will explain why nicotine
265.11,is so effective in increasing focus.
268.17,And these two protocols are as follows.
270.66,Data based on studies
done,in Wendy Suzuki's lab
273.81,at New York University.
275.43,"And of course, Wendy was"
a,guest on this podcast.
277.98,So you can check out
that,"episode if you like,"
279.78,but studies done in her laboratory point
282.03,"to the fact that a daily,"
very,"brief, in fact,"
284.76,only 13 minute meditation
can,vastly increase
288.78,"focus and focus ability,"
290.46,not just immediately after
the,"meditation practice,"
293.61,but at all other times as well.
295.68,"So again,"
296.513,this is a meditation practice done daily
298.62,for just 13 minutes.
299.7,It's a very simple meditation practice
301.23,"where one sits or lies down,"
302.7,closes your eyes and
directs,your attention
306.45,to a place just between your
two,eyes and right above it.
309.78,So on your forehead.
310.613,"But just inside of that,"
311.82,and please understand that your brain
313.59,does not have sensory receptors.
314.85,So unlike focusing on your fingertips
316.74,"and the sensations there,"
if,"you focus on your brain,"
319.59,you can't actually sense anything
320.97,in your brain except your thoughts.
322.23,So the idea then is that you
continually,bring your focus
325.41,back to that location just about an inch
328.11,behind your forehead over and over again.
330.18,And it's the refocusing of your attention
332.61,to that location after it drifts
334.29,that succeeds in increasing
your,"focus ability, again,"
337.32,not just during the
meditation,"and afterward,"
339.3,but at other times as well.
340.92,So this 13 minute a day
meditation,is exceedingly simple
343.68,and exceedingly effective.
345.51,"It should be performed every day,"
346.95,"but if you miss a day,"
just,go back to doing it.
349.05,Don't despair too much.
350.43,And you will see these
positive,"effects, say the data."
352.8,Also increase effects on mood and other
355.11,positive aspects of mental
health,and performance.
357.39,So that's the first tool in protocol.
359.16,The second tool in protocol
relates,to the general
361.86,what I called arrow model of focus.
364.71,This was a model that I created
in,order to simplify the
367.47,vast amounts of data on
focus,and concentration
370.02,and how they are created
371.1,by the various chemical
systems,within your brain.
374.07,We're going to hear a lot about
these,chemical systems again
376.11,today in the context of nicotine
and,they are as follows.
379.44,You can think about focus
380.97,on any goal or any endeavor as an arrow.
384.0,So just imagine an arrow
which,has an arrow head
386.13,"and a shaft, and we'll"
add,a third component
387.81,to it in a moment.
389.88,"The head of the arrow,"
391.17,"meaning the direction of your focus,"
392.7,"is largely set by acetylcholine,"
395.19,which is a chemical in the brain.
396.69,The shaft of the arrow
is,set by a chemical
399.78,"called adrenaline, also"
called,epinephrine.
402.6,Those are the same thing.
403.47,In the brain typically it's
referred,"to as epinephrine,"
406.26,"and in the body,"
407.28,it's more commonly
referred,"to as adrenaline,"
409.14,but those are the same neurochemical.
411.06,Epinephrine slash adrenaline
represents,the shaft
414.3,of the arrow and it's providing the energy
417.51,for which to focus.
419.22,And then we can put behind that arrow
420.6,a little propeller or
a,"motor, if you like,"
423.15,and the propeller or motor in the context
424.95,"of this neurochemistry model is dopamine,"
427.47,which provides ongoing motivation.
429.18,It pushes that arrow forward continually
431.67,as you strive to focus
on,a particular thing.
435.18,"This particular arrow model,"
436.74,that is your ability
to,"increase your focus,"
439.68,can be enhanced therefore
by,"increasing acetylcholine,"
443.07,"epinephrine, and dopamine simultaneously."
446.7,And there are a lot of
different,ways to do that.
448.41,But one of the more effective ways to do
449.91,that via supplement protocols
is,so-called Alpha GPC.
454.2,Alpha GPC taken in 300
milligram,form 10 to 30 minutes
458.82,before a about of cognitive
work,or a about of physical work
461.85,will increase your focus by way
of,"increasing acetylcholine,"
464.76,"and to some extent, increasing"
epinephrine,as well.
468.87,The dopamine increase will
have,to be achieved either
471.21,"through cognitive processing,"
473.19,that is telling yourself
you're,doing a good job
474.87,and moving forward because thoughts really
476.52,"do impact your levels of dopamine,"
478.59,or some other sort of
pro,dopamine or dopamine
481.68,increasing protocol also
discussed,in the toolkit for focus
485.16,and our episode on dopamine
for,motivation and drive.
488.07,So the key thing here to
understand,is that the 13 minute
490.41,a day meditation is a very effective way
492.48,to increase focus capacity.
494.22,"And then in the short term,"
495.48,if you want to provide a
boost,"now and again to focus,"
498.63,300 milligrams of Alpha
GPC,can be very effective.
501.39,There are various sources for that
502.413,that we'll link to one of them
in,the show note captions.
506.07,By no means am I saying that
you,need to take alpha GPC.
508.77,A number of people will
certainly,opt not to.
510.78,And a number of people
might,"be saying, well,"
513.21,I've heard that Alpha GPC
can,increase focus by way of
515.82,increasing acetylcholine and
norepinephrine,"or epinephrine,"
519.09,"but it can also increase TMAO,"
521.1,which is a kind of a negative
marker,of cardiac health
524.19,and cardiovascular health.
525.69,"For that reason, I and many"
others,will take 600 milligrams
529.02,"of a garlic capsule, which"
can,offset that TMAO increase.
533.37,It remains uncertain as to how much
535.14,Alpha GPC one needs to
take,before increasing TMAO
538.62,levels to a point where it's of concern
540.69,that you would even need
to,take the garlic capsule.
542.79,"But I just mention it in any case,"
544.56,because it's a pretty simple fix.
546.33,Garlic has other health
benefits,"too, of course,"
548.76,"and for most people,"
550.2,300 milligrams of Alpha GPC
taken,every once in a while.
553.26,I certainly don't encourage people
554.66,to take Alpha GPC every
time,they want to focus.
557.349,"I always emphasize behavioral tools first,"
560.61,then focusing on nutritional
tools,and on occasion using
564.3,supplement based tools to encourage
566.91,increased levels of focus.
569.04,And then of course there are a various
571.26,number of different prescription compounds
573.93,that if you're working with
a,"board certified physician,"
576.15,they could prescribe you
576.983,if you need additional tools
for,"focus, things like Ritalin,"
580.08,"Adderall, Modafinil,"
"Armodafinil,","Vyvanse, et cetera,"
583.17,for many people are going to
be,important and maybe even
585.51,"necessary for people with ADHD, et cetera,"
588.12,but that's a category into itself.
589.467,"And as I always say,"
590.46,"I'm not a physician, so I"
don't,prescribe anything.
592.74,"I'm a professor, so I profess many things."
596.389,And today I just wanted to
pass,along or redirect your
598.47,attention to that episode on focus
601.53,"and highlight those two tools,"
602.85,"the 13 minute a day meditation,"
604.77,and 300 milligram Alpha GPC
for,increasing focus capacity
608.76,"and for acutely,"
610.32,that is temporarily
giving,an additional boost
612.9,for a about of focus.
614.49,"And of course, if you choose"
not,"to use those protocols,"
617.1,"that's perfectly fine too,"
there's,certainly no obligation.
619.56,They are simply available to you
620.79,should you choose to try them.
622.95,And if nothing else you now have in mind
625.86,"the neurochemistry of acetylcholine,"
628.11,epinephrine slash
"adrenaline,","and dopamine,"
630.48,and that will really set the
stage,for understanding just
633.39,how effective and why nicotine
636.17,is so effective at
increasing,"focus, motivation,"
639.06,"and even as you'll soon hear,"
640.74,working memory and cognitive capacity.
642.84,"Before we begin,"
643.8,I'd like to emphasize that
this,podcast is separate
645.99,from my teaching and
research,roles at Stanford.
648.27,It is however part of my desire and effort
650.58,to bring zero cost to consumer information
652.5,about science and science related tools
654.66,"to the general public, and"
keeping,"with that theme,"
656.97,I'd like to thank the
sponsors,of today's podcast.
659.61,Our first sponsor is Thesis.
661.62,"Thesis makes custom nootropics,"
and,"to be quite direct,"
665.04,I do not like the word
nootropics,because it translates
668.1,"to smart drugs, and to be direct again,"
671.85,there is no such thing as a smart drug.
673.89,That is there's no such thing as a drug
675.99,that can make you smarter
because,there is no circuit
678.72,in the brain for being smart.
679.98,There are circuits in the brain for focus.
681.36,There are circuits in the
brain,for task switching.
683.73,There are circuits in the
brain,related to creativity
686.07,and so on and so forth.
687.33,So the idea that there
would,be a single smart drug
689.64,or nootropic is simply foolish.
692.64,And fortunately Thesis
understands,this and therefore has
696.24,created custom notropics that
are,designed to get you into
699.54,the states of mind and body
that,are optimal for your goals.
702.72,I've been taking Thesis
nootropics,"for quite a while now,"
705.12,and I've been extremely
pleased,with the results.
707.82,I take a clarity formula
that's,specifically designed
710.4,for me prior to long
bouts,of cognitive work.
713.04,And I take an energy formula
prior,to particularly
715.95,challenging physical workouts.
717.69,To get your own personalized
nootropic,"starter kit,"
719.91,you can go online to
takethesis.com/huberman.,
723.42,Take a three minute quiz and
Thesis,will send you four
726.09,different formulas to
try,in your first month.
728.19,"Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman"
730.95,and use the code Huberman at checkout
732.81,to get 10% off your first box.
734.76,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by InsideTracker.
737.359,InsideTracker is a personalized
nutrition,platform that
740.07,analyzes data from your blood
and,DNA to help you better
743.04,reach your health goals.
744.63,I've long been a believer in
getting,regular blood work done
746.97,for the simple reason
that,many of the factors
749.16,that impact your immediate
and,long-term health
751.08,can only be analyzed with
a,quality blood test.
753.69,One of the major issues
754.56,"with blood tests or DNA tests, however,"
756.476,is that typically you'll
get,your data back
758.61,and you won't know what
to,do with those data.
760.71,InsideTracker has solved
this,problem by creating a
763.14,personalized platform where
when,you get numbers back
765.84,"about your hormones,"
metabolic,"factors, et cetera,"
768.48,it will direct you to specific protocols
770.52,"in the realms of nutrition,"
"exercise,",supplementation.
773.58,And that includes things
to,"do, things to consider,"
776.58,and things not to do in
order,to bring those numbers
779.07,into the ranges that are
optimal,for your immediate
781.62,and long-term goals.

793.74,Today's episode is also
brought,to us by ROKA.
796.2,ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
798.03,that are the absolute highest quality.
800.01,The company was founded by
two,all American swimmers
802.02,"from Stanford, and everything about ROKA"
804.03,eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
805.95,with performance in mind.
807.33,I've spent a lifetime
working,on the biology
808.79,of the visual system.
809.73,And I can tell you that your
visual,system has to contend
812.04,with a number of important
challenges,in order for you
814.05,to be able to see clearly.
815.31,Now ROKA understands this and everything
816.93,about their eyeglasses were
designed,in order for you
819.39,to see with optimal clarity
regardless,of activities.
822.18,ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses are superb
824.76,for wearing while you run or cycle.
826.86,"In fact, they were originally"
designed,for that purpose.
828.9,They're extremely lightweight.
830.1,"In fact, most of the time,"
830.933,I can't even remember
that,"they're on my face,"
833.37,and they won't fall off if you get sweaty.
836.25,"In addition, ROKA"
eyeglasses,and sunglasses
838.98,have a terrific aesthetic.
840.36,So while a lot of so-called
performance,eyeglasses out there
842.82,will make you look like
a,"cyborg if you want to,"
844.65,"and they do have those varieties,"
846.03,they also have varieties of
aesthetic,choices that you would
849.51,be very comfortable wearing
to,work or to school
851.94,or just out and about.
853.674,And that's one of the reasons I like them.
854.507,I don't really have to think about having
855.39,too many pairs of
sunglasses,or eyeglasses.
857.55,I can just have one or two of
each,pair and I'm good to go
860.34,no matter where I go.
861.6,If you'd like to try ROKA
eyeglasses,"and sunglasses,"
864.21,"you can go to ROKA, that's roka.com,"
866.7,and enter the code
Huberman,to save 20% off
869.16,on your first order.
870.06,"Again, that's roka.com and"
enter,the code Huberman
874.02,at checkout.
874.86,Let's talk about nicotine
and,how nicotine impacts
877.44,"our brains, our bodies,"
our,"mental performance,"
881.04,"our mental health, our"
physical,"performance,"
883.47,and our physical health.
884.937,"Now once again,"
885.77,I want to remind everybody that
we,really need to separate out
888.63,a discussion about nicotine
from,the discussion
891.3,about the delivery device for nicotine.
893.79,"In other words, when we're"
talking,"about nicotine,"
896.13,we are not necessarily
talking,about smoking.
898.68,Although we might be.
900.03,There are things associated
with,smoking and with vaping and
903.72,other means of getting
nicotine,into our system
906.84,that have their own
"effects,","both negative,"
909.39,and in some cases positive.
912.03,"Indeed later,"
912.863,we will talk about how you
can,actually use nicotine
915.63,to get over smoking addiction.
917.16,This won't come as a
surprise,"to many people,"
919.2,but what perhaps will come as
a,surprise is the fact that
921.99,many people actually use
nicotine-like,substances or
924.81,nicotine itself in order to
relieve,nicotine addiction.
928.56,So we'll talk about that
and,what that looks like
930.48,and offer various protocols
for,you later in the episode.
934.26,I also want to mention here
at,the outset that I have
936.03,a long standing interest in nicotine.
938.319,"In fact, early in my scientific career,"
940.71,I did research on nicotine
942.21,and its role in brain development.
944.52,And I've had a long standing
interest,"in neuroplasticity,"
947.94,the brain's ability to change
in,response to experience.
950.52,And so experiments that have
been,done by close colleagues
952.68,and friends of mine have really emphasized
954.45,"the fact that acetylcholine,"
and,"in particular,"
957.45,when acetylcholine activates so-called
959.64,"nicotinic receptors,"
961.38,something you'll learn
more,"about in a little bit,"
963.69,that can actually serve
as,a gateway or a trigger
966.93,for directed rewiring of the brain.
969.24,So this is fascinating.
970.14,We think of nicotine as
something,"that we take,"
972.42,but actually we have
receptors,that is locations
975.87,in the brain to which nicotine binds
978.69,and can exert its effects.
980.7,And those receptors did not
come,about because of the
983.1,existence of tobacco or the
existence,"of vaping pens,"
985.98,or because of the existence of anything
987.84,in the outside world.
989.01,The fact that there are
nicotinic,receptors in our brain
993.36,and body tells you that acetylcholine
996.57,and nicotine themselves
have,very important roles
999.03,"in normal brain and body function,"
1001.7,so much so that I often
like,to point to an anecdote
1004.58,of a very well known Nobel
prize,winning neuroscientist.
1008.33,I won't reveal who they are.
1009.5,"They're not a faculty member at Stanford,"
1011.0,but many neuroscientists
know,of this person
1014.33,and many people in the outside
world,know of this person.
1016.52,And they are also well known
for,their love of nicotine.
1020.99,I once sat in this
person's,"office, and he,"
1023.45,"I will reveal it as a he,"
1025.91,consumed no fewer than
three,pieces of nicotine gum
1030.35,during that relatively short conversation
1032.39,of about 45 minutes.
1033.92,And that was surprising to me.
1035.54,And I asked him why he was
taking,so much nicotine
1039.32,through nicotine gum.
1040.73,"And he replied that for years,"
1041.78,"he had been a chronic smoker,"
1043.371,which on the one hand had greatly impaired
1046.19,"his cardiovascular health and his fitness,"
1048.08,no surprise there.
1048.913,And we'll talk a little bit more about
1050.03,what the underlying reasons
"are,","but most everyone,"
1053.0,if not everyone knows
that,smoking cigarettes
1055.64,or smoking in general
really,impairs lung health.
1058.91,There's just simply no question about it.
1060.71,There are some more or less
unhealthy,"ways to smoke,"
1064.91,but the quite honest
message,is that smoking
1067.91,of any kind is going to disrupt
lung,"endothelial function,"
1071.27,"lung function, blood"
"vessels,",and so forth.
1073.67,It's going to make it harder
to,"breathe with vigor,"
1075.56,"take deep breaths, deliver"
oxygen,"to tissues, et cetera."
1078.89,"That said,"
1080.0,he also pointed out that
the,data on nicotine
1083.3,specifically are pointing
to,the fact that nicotine
1087.14,"can be, can be protective"
against,certain forms
1091.04,of cognitive impairment.
1092.66,And that is why he continued
1094.01,to chew nicotine containing gum.
1096.35,And he swore by the focus
enhancing,and motivation enhancing
1099.71,effects of nicotine containing gum.
1102.29,Now that is not a call to
arms,for you to run out
1104.75,and start chewing or consuming
nicotine,containing products.
1108.56,We will talk about those
products,"later in the episode,"
1110.78,"some of their potential advantages,"
1112.25,some of their potential disadvantages.
1114.17,Now I share this anecdote
because,it nicely separates
1117.44,nicotine from the delivery device
1119.27,through which nicotine arrives.
1121.37,Now I haven't talked to this individual
1123.14,in a few years to see whether
not,the nicotine is working
1126.77,to stave off any kind of
Alzheimer's,or neurodegenerative
1129.65,or cognitive impairment
that,would come with age.
1132.23,This gentleman is getting up in the years
1135.11,"and seems quite sharp nonetheless,"
1137.24,but then again was
always,exceedingly sharp.
1140.18,The point is nicotine is a
substance,that can both promote
1145.19,"cognitive function, and"
under,"some conditions,"
1148.82,"if taken to inappropriate,"
1150.86,"or I should say to extreme dosages,"
1152.72,can also impair cognitive function.
1154.79,So today we really need to
have,a nuanced conversation
1157.28,"about nicotine, one that"
includes,"some of the benefits,"
1160.1,"some of the drawbacks, in"
particular,"for children,"
1163.4,"certainly for people that are pregnant,"
1165.71,"for people that have addictive tendencies,"
1167.9,and for people that have depression
1169.82,and any other kind of mood disorders.
1172.37,What I will tell you soon
is,that nicotine can be very
1176.42,powerful as a mood modulator
and,many people who have tried
1180.26,to quit nicotine mainly
through,the form of smoking
1183.47,will find that their mood
can,drop substantially.
1186.41,So nicotine does a lot of
things,in the brain and body.
1189.05,And so I'd like to begin by
talking,about what exactly
1191.96,nicotine is and how it
impacts,your brain and body.
1195.38,So what is nicotine and where is it found?
1197.57,Now obviously nicotine is
found,"in the tobacco plant,"
1200.45,but nicotine is also found in nightshades.
1203.72,"That is tomatoes, eggplant,"
and,sweet peppers.
1207.23,Although the concentrations
of,"nicotine in tomatoes,"
1209.99,"eggplants, and sweet"
peppers,is vastly lower
1212.87,than it is in the tobacco plant.
1215.09,You actually can also
find,nicotine in potatoes.
1218.18,Now why is nicotine present
in,potatoes and tomatoes
1221.84,and in the tobacco plant at all?
1224.15,"Well, nicotine is a plant alkaloid."
1226.49,We'll get into alkaloids
a,"little bit later,"
1228.38,but it is thought that these
alkaloids,evolved in plants
1231.95,as a way to prevent
insects,from eating them.
1235.97,And without going into
a,"lot of insect biology,"
1238.25,the reason or the rationale
behind,this explanation is that
1241.49,nicotine is not only a substance
in,tobacco that people use
1245.24,or in the various
medications,"that people use,"
1247.13,but it's also used as a
pesticide,because it can
1250.37,dramatically disrupt the
nervous,system of insects.
1254.03,"It can render them infertile,"
1255.77,which is not to say that it
renders,humans infertile.
1258.41,"We want to say, again,"
1259.243,it is not the case that nicotine
renders,"humans infertile,"
1262.34,but it can make certain insects infertile.
1264.68,It can actually disrupt
their,motor function
1266.567,"and their brain function,"
1267.98,and the reasons that it
has,such different effects
1270.5,"on insects, in other words,"
1271.94,it can kill them or prevent
them,"from reproducing,"
1275.81,and therefore explains why
plants,probably evolved to have
1278.75,"this plant alkaloid, nicotine."
1281.43,"In humans,"
1282.263,because of the differences
in,"receptors for nicotine,"
1286.01,"where they're located, and"
the,"types of receptors,"
1289.276,the effects of nicotine on
humans,is quite a bit different.
1291.38,"And again, it does not"
cause,infertility in humans.
1294.02,Although I will talk a
little,bit later about some
1296.09,double blind peer-reviewed
studies,conducted in humans
1299.15,"that indicate that for instance,"
1301.64,"nicotine can reduce penile girth,"
1304.28,"that is the girth of the penis,"
1305.48,and can lead to certain
forms,of sexual dysfunction.
1308.72,And those changes are
largely,downstream of changes
1311.9,in blood flow and
endothelial,cell function.
1315.02,Endothelial cells are the cells
that,make up blood vessels
1317.75,and other vascular type tissues
within,the brain and body.
1320.96,So nicotine is found in these plants.
1323.0,And what we can know for sure is
1325.46,"that at some point in human evolution,"
1327.98,"somebody or some group of people,"
1329.96,"either, and here, I'm completely guessing,"
1332.36,"it's a just so story,"
1334.49,but someone or some group must
have,inhaled the smoke from
1339.2,the tobacco plant or put the dried leaves
1342.71,of the tobacco plant
against,"some mucosal tissue,"
1346.04,and you know the different
mucosal,linings of their body
1347.93,by which substances can
pass,"through, that's right."
1351.17,Any of the mucosal soft
lining,tissues of the body
1354.5,"will allow certain substances,"
1356.21,not all certain substances to pass in.
1358.01,That's why people can put
tobacco,in their mouth
1360.356,and a certain amount of nicotine makes it
1361.189,"into the bloodstream,"
1362.022,"put tobacco up their nose,"
1363.334,certain amount of nicotine
gets,into the bloodstream.
1365.42,I haven't heard of people
putting,tobacco in other orifices
1368.15,of their body containing mucosal tissue.
1369.71,And I'm certainly not
suggesting,"people do that,"
1371.75,but you get the idea
1372.8,"and how nicotine gets from these plants,"
1374.87,these dried leaves into the bloodstream.
1378.44,Burning tobacco leads
to,a heat induced change
1382.31,in the availability of nicotine.
1384.05,And this is why smoking tobacco
1386.39,"or vaping tobacco,"
simply,"by heating it up,"
1390.67,allows the nicotine to be
liberated,and go into the
1392.99,bloodstream simply by
inhaling,it into the lungs.
1395.36,We will get back to smoking
of,various kinds later.
1398.15,But right now let's just keep
our,attention on how nicotine
1402.41,is pulled from these plants
and,into the human body.
1405.89,Now whether by inhalation
or,whether or not by placing
1409.52,in contact with the
mucosal,tissue of the mouth
1411.77,or other mucosal containing
orifice,"of the body,"
1416.06,the nicotine then gets
into,the bloodstream.
1418.34,"And once it's in the bloodstream,"
1420.32,it only exerts its
effects,because it binds
1422.84,to certain so-called nicotinic receptors.
1427.56,So the nicotinic receptors
1429.05,are of the acetylcholinergic variety.
1431.84,I know this is a lot to think
about,and a lot to hear if you
1434.12,"haven't heard about this, but"
it's,actually quite simple.
1436.1,Anyone can understand this.
1437.72,"Acetylcholine is a molecule,"
1441.17,a chemical that is that's
released,in the brain and body.
1445.76,"And when it binds to receptors,"
1447.68,"that is little parking spots on cells,"
1449.69,it changes the way those cells behave.
1451.91,Those cells can increase their activity
1453.89,and release other chemicals.
1454.94,"They can become electrically active,"
1456.26,they can do any number
of,different things.
1459.14,"When we ingest nicotine,"
1461.69,it gets into the bloodstream
and,eventually some of that
1463.583,will get into the brain and
some,of it gets into the body.
1466.13,"And in both of the brain and body,"
1467.66,there are the so-called nicotinic
acetylcholine,receptors.
1470.72,"Now the so-called family,"
and,"indeed they are a family,"
1474.29,this is how we refer
to,groups of receptors
1476.87,of related design and genetic
background,just like humans.
1480.8,You have a family of these
acetylcholine,receptors
1483.62,that are of the nicotinic variety.
1484.94,So maybe on one street
in,"your neighborhood,"
1486.92,"you know the Joneses and another street,"
1488.48,you know the Chows and another
"street,","well in your body,"
1491.0,you have the nicotinic
acetylcholine,"receptors,"
1493.16,and then you have the so-called
1493.993,muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
1496.16,Today it's really simple.
1497.21,Nicotine only binds to the
nicotinic,acetylcholine
1499.55,receptors and there are
a,bunch of different ones
1501.68,on a bunch of different tissues.
1503.21,And the differences in those
receptors,dictate what sorts of
1507.35,effects the nicotine will
have,on those tissues.
1511.43,So let's talk about
what,"those effects are,"
1513.05,and let's do that by dividing
the,effects of nicotine
1515.54,"into effects on the brain,"
1517.13,so everything from the
neck,"up, and on the body,"
1519.65,the so-called central nervous
system,and the periphery.
1522.14,Although I want to point
out,that your spinal cord
1523.55,is part of the central nervous system.
1524.78,"So in fairness to the reality,"
1527.36,your brain and spinal cord are
all,central nervous system.
1530.42,Everything else is
considered,the periphery.
1532.91,Now there are a lot of different nicotinic
1534.41,"acetylcholine receptors,"
1535.73,but for those of you that
want,"to know, you aficionados,"
1538.34,"or if you're ultra curious about this,"
1540.77,the main effects of nicotine
in,the brain are mediated
1544.52,by nicotine binding to the so-called
1547.01,alpha four beta two receptor.
1549.77,Alpha four beta two receptor.
1552.14,Even if you don't care
about,"receptor subtypes,"
1554.57,that's going to come up
later,when we discuss
1556.43,why nicotine suppresses appetite.
1559.37,"In fact, one of the major"
reasons,why people don't want
1562.13,"to quit smoking, or they quit smoking"
1564.77,"or another form of ingesting nicotine,"
1566.57,"and then they relapse,"
1568.13,they go back to smoking or
ingesting,nicotine in some other
1571.55,way is because indeed nicotine
will,increase metabolism
1575.84,and reduce hunger in large part
1578.24,by binding to this alpha
four,beta two receptor
1580.88,in a particular area of the brain.
1581.96,We're going to return
to,"that in a little bit,"
1583.1,but if you've ever heard that
nicotine,"kills the appetite,"
1586.07,indeed it does.
1587.45,It's not the behavior of smoking itself.
1589.629,It's not because you
always,have a cigarette
1590.462,in your mouth that you're
not,eating more food.
1592.07,Although I suppose that
might,be a minor effect.
1594.26,There are direct effects of
nicotine,"on both appetite,"
1597.53,"that is, it reduces"
appetite,and direct effects
1599.96,"on metabolism, that is,"
1600.97,it increases metabolism
through,its effects
1603.02,on some other areas of the brain and body
1604.61,we'll talk about in a moment.
1605.687,"Now within the brain,"
1607.25,nicotine binds to this
alpha,four beta two receptor
1611.27,in various locations in the brain.
1612.92,And there are three and maybe
a,fourth that we'll talk about
1616.07,neurochemical effects of
nicotine,after you ingest it.
1619.58,"First things first,"
1620.66,when you ingest nicotine
1621.95,"by smoking nicotine containing tobacco,"
1625.4,or if you place tobacco in
contact,with the mucosal lining
1629.87,"of the nasal passages of the mouth,"
1632.18,takes about two to 15
minutes,for that nicotine
1636.17,to enter the bloodstream.
1637.003,Smoking hits the bloodstream
"faster,","vaping even faster,"
1640.49,I should mention for a
variety,of reasons and placing
1644.42,tobacco directly in contact
with,the mucosal lining
1647.42,is going to be the slowest.
1648.8,"Now as I mentioned before,"
1649.97,nicotine gets into the bloodstream
and,then because nicotine
1652.85,can pass through the so-called
blood,"brain barrier, the BBB,"
1656.69,which is basically a
fence,"around the brain,"
1659.09,because it can pass through
the,"blood brain barrier,"
1661.34,it's going to have very
rapid,effects on the brain
1663.56,in these four major categories
1665.66,of neurochemicals and neural circuits.
1668.87,"The first of those categories,"
this,"is a very important one,"
1672.11,this is one that was brought
up,"in the episode on dopamine,"
1674.21,"motivation, and drive."
1675.92,"And I think not just all scientists,"
1677.24,but all human beings should
know,"that within their brain,"
1680.24,they have what is called the
mesolimbic,reward pathway.
1685.34,The mesolimbic reward pathway
if,"you just want to call it,"
1687.5,the dopamine reward pathway
"is,","as the name suggests,"
1691.07,a set of connections between a brain area
1692.99,called the ventral tegmental area.
1694.52,You don't have to remember
the,"names of these things,"
1696.5,"of course, but if you"
want,"to, that's fine too."
1698.78,The ventral tegmental area
1700.13,or VTA connects to another area called
1702.86,the nucleus accumbens.
1704.9,Now here's what's very important.
1706.46,Nicotine triggers the release of dopamine
1710.45,from the nucleus accumbens.
1711.68,This is what gives nicotine
its,rewarding properties.
1714.77,It increases motivation.
1716.15,"It tends to give a not so subtle,"
1719.27,but very transient increase in feelings
1721.64,of wellbeing and alertness and motivation.
1724.76,And that's because of
the,increase in dopamine
1726.8,caused by nicotine directly
within,the nucleus accumbens.
1732.05,Nicotine also triggers the
release,of certain neurochemicals
1735.32,from the ventral tegmental area itself.
1737.51,And those impinge on nucleus accumbens
1739.85,and increase dopamine levels further.
1742.22,This is what makes the rewarding
properties,or sometimes
1745.1,referred to as the reinforcing
properties,of nicotine
1747.83,so powerful.
1748.73,This is why so many billions
of,people ingest nicotine
1753.11,in one form or another.
1754.13,It's also why nicotine is so hard to quit
1758.12,because there's a potent
increase,in dopamine
1760.85,from multiple neural circuit pathways
1763.1,within this mesolimbic reward circuitry.
1766.34,Now within the mesolimbic
reward,"circuitry,"
1769.07,there's an interesting feature.
1769.97,There are accelerators
that,essentially push out
1772.7,"more dopamine, get more dopamine released,"
1774.92,and there are breaks of the
so-called,GABAergic variety.
1777.83,GABA's an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
1779.96,You don't need to know too much
about,it to just understand
1782.36,"that nicotine both increases dopamine,"
1785.66,but also decreases the activity of GABA.
1789.38,And so this is like
pushing,on the accelerator
1791.48,"for dopamine, but also removing the brake."
1794.69,So there's a two pronged
effect,of nicotine
1797.96,on reinforcement reward
dopamine,"related pathways,"
1801.32,the feel good motivation pathways.
1803.99,And that is an increase in
dopamine,and a decrease in GABA.
1808.52,"And again,"
1809.353,that's all mediated through
this,"mesolimbic reward pathway,"
1811.37,involving the ventral tegmental area
1813.29,and the nucleus accumbens.
1814.7,So if you can conceptualize
1815.9,"even just 5% of what I just told you,"
1818.3,or even if you can just remember
nicotine,increases dopamine
1821.3,"and that's why it feels so good,"
1822.52,"it makes you want more of it,"
1824.69,you will have everything you
need,to know in mind in order
1827.69,to understand both why
nicotine,"is so highly used,"
1832.76,"and indeed abused, why"
it's,"so hard to quit,"
1835.22,and that will point to avenues
1836.78,as to how to quit or reduce intake.
1839.12,And it also points to
how,nicotine can actually
1841.7,be used in an antidepressant
way,should you choose.
1845.69,And we will talk about
what,the various criteria
1848.15,"are for choosing that,"
1849.38,but just to understand
nicotine,"increases motivation,"
1853.07,"it decreases negative feelings of mood,"
1855.71,it increases positive feelings
of,mood and motivation.
1858.47,Before we continue with
today's,"discussion,"
1860.69,I'd like to just briefly
acknowledge,our sponsor
1862.79,"Athletic Greens, now called AG1."
1866.0,"Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,"
1868.25,is an all in one vitamin
mineral,probiotic drink
1870.71,that also has adaptogens
and,digestive enzymes.
1873.77,I've been taking Athletic
Greens,since way back in 2012.
1876.5,So I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring,the podcast.
1878.93,The reason I started taking
Athletic,Greens and the reason I
1880.94,still drink Athletic Greens
twice,a day is that it supplies
1884.72,total foundational coverage of
my,vitamin and mineral needs.
1887.78,And it supplies important
nutrients,that I need to support

1904.94,and high performance
1905.84,in any endeavors we might be involved in.

1931.82,The second major effect that
nicotine,has in the brain
1934.49,is that it increases acetylcholine.
1937.13,Acetylcholine is a
neuromodulator,that exists in you
1939.92,"and me, it is released from"
multiple,sites in the brain.
1943.58,And the two major sites
are,"the nucleus basalis,"
1947.45,so these are a collection
of,neurons in the front
1950.69,"and base of your brain, and"
from,some brain stem areas.
1954.02,And there are a bunch of different ones
1955.49,"back there in your brain stem,"
1956.69,which is indeed in the back
that,release acetylcholine
1960.818,that include the locus coeruleus
as,"kind of a minor site,"
1962.45,the pedunculopontine nucleus.
1964.34,There are a bunch of
these,"different areas,"
1966.77,that parabigeminal nucleus.
1968.27,There are a bunch of
these,things back there.
1969.83,"We don't have to go into all the names,"
1971.3,but just understand that they're
little,"pockets of neurons,"
1973.76,nerve cells located in
the,front and the back
1975.98,and some extent in the
middle,"of your brain,"
1977.54,but really in the front
and,"the back of your brain,"
1979.46,that can serve two major
"role,",here they are.
1983.99,Acetylcholine released from
nucleus,basalis leads to
1987.2,a sort of spotlighting or highlighting
1989.63,of particular neural
circuits,in the brain.
1991.82,What do I mean by this?
1992.653,Well let's say you're working on a puzzle.
1994.85,Let's say it's a cognitive puzzle.
1995.96,"Maybe you're doing a word puzzle,"
1997.58,or nowadays I've heard
of,this Wordle thing.
1999.56,I'm on Twitter and
people,are always posting
2001.03,their Wordle thing and I
have,"no idea what it is,"
2002.92,but I'm guessing it's some sort of puzzle.
2004.6,"I'm guessing it's like a crossword puzzle,"
2006.07,"and here, if I'm wrong,"
I,"don't know, educate me."
2007.81,Tell me what Wordle is.
2008.68,Somebody put it in the comments
2009.94,and tell me if I should play it or not.
2012.22,Here's the deal.
2014.29,When acetylcholine is
released,"from nucleus basalis,"
2016.9,the neurons are there in
the,"base of the brain,"
2019.45,"but they extend axons,"
2021.04,which are like little wires
elsewhere,in the brain.
2023.11,"And when acetylcholine is released,"
2025.06,it tends to be released at
particular,locations in the brain
2027.73,that are associated with whatever activity
2029.62,we happen to be doing.
2030.52,"So if I'm doing Wordle,"
2032.38,here I'm talking about it
as,"if I've ever done it,"
2034.24,"doing a crossword puzzle or Wordle,"
2036.04,well the neurons that were
involved,in trying to figure out
2038.08,the solution to that Wordle or
crossword,"puzzle are active,"
2040.93,and then acetylcholine is
released,"from the little wires,"
2043.66,the little endings of these
cells,in nucleus basalis.
2046.54,And all of a sudden those
neural,circuits get a boost.
2049.51,"They become more active,"
and,"believe it or not,"
2052.117,our ability to perform
that,crossword puzzle
2054.67,or at least focus on that Wordle
2056.16,or crossword puzzle gets enhanced.
2059.08,It literally increases
our,attention for that
2061.78,and not anything else is enhanced.
2063.82,So it's literally like a neurochemical
2066.01,attentional spotlight.
2067.84,Nicotine increases
acetylcholine,and thereby focus
2071.5,"and concentration and mental performance,"
2073.48,not by changing the neural circuits
2076.06,"that are activated per se,"
2077.8,but rather by making more acetylcholine
2080.98,available at those release sites.
2083.62,So it's as if the
spotlight,"got more intense,"
2086.38,the highlighter is more intense
than,it would be otherwise.
2089.38,And I should also mention because
2091.18,"of the so-called pharmacokinetics,"
2092.83,the time course in which
nicotine,"has its effects,"
2095.98,"which are pretty short lived,"
2097.27,"we'll talk about those in a moment,"
2098.77,this enhancement in cognitive performance
2101.08,"and attention, it's going"
to,"be very transient,"
2103.42,probably on the order of
about,"30, maybe 45 minutes,"
2106.87,"the half life of nicotine,"
2108.01,depending on how it's ingested and whether
2109.23,or not you have food in the gut
2110.41,and what else is in the
"bloodstream,","et cetera,"
2112.12,it's going to be anywhere
from,"one to two hours,"
2114.49,but typically the effects
of,nicotine will come on
2116.38,in about two to 15 minutes
as,"I mentioned before,"
2118.96,and then will last anywhere
from,about 30 to 45 minutes.
2122.47,"This is why in the old days,"
2124.03,and still to some extent in
certain,"areas of the world,"
2126.46,but less so in the United States
2128.26,"and certainly in Europe as well,"
2130.12,we don't see quite as many
people,"smoking cigarettes,"
2132.7,for reasons we can discuss later.
2134.89,But you would see these chain smokers
2137.17,who are trying to maintain constant levels
2139.81,of nicotine in their
brain,and bloodstream.
2142.03,Now perhaps they didn't know that nicotine
2144.82,"has this one to two hour half life,"
2146.35,but they could sense
no,doubt the cognitive
2149.71,"and the physical effects of nicotine,"
2151.0,including this cognitive
enhancement,effect
2152.89,and highlighting of
neural,circuits effect.
2155.29,And they would notice they
would,smoke a cigarette
2157.63,and then for the next five
to,45 minutes have heightened
2160.75,focus and then they
would,start to drop off.
2162.13,So they smoke another cigarette.
2163.18,"So in other words,"
2164.013,they're trying to maintain
a,constant level of nicotine
2167.35,for whatever activities
they,needed to perform.
2169.33,Obviously chain smoking
2170.8,because of the terrible
effects,"of smoking,"
2173.59,"I'll talk about those terrible effects,"
2174.547,but I'm sure you've heard
of,"them before, cancer,"
2177.94,depletion of just about
every,organ and body tissue
2180.67,to the point that it
can,actually be measured
2182.83,how many years of your
life,you're peeling off
2184.72,in terms of lifespan and
health,span by smoking.
2187.36,Well the terrible effects
of,"smoking are indisputable,"
2191.41,but the positive effects of
nicotine,"on this circuitry,"
2195.46,part of the reason why
people,would chain smoke
2197.83,in the first place rather
than,get one big peak
2200.5,of concentration and focus
and,then just let it disappear
2202.75,after 45 minutes.
2205.18,So what we have is a
scenario,where dopamine
2207.46,is going up in the mesolimbic pathway.
2209.59,That's why smoking or ingesting
nicotine,in any other way
2212.41,feels good and makes us feel motivated.
2214.69,"And then the increase in acetylcholine,"
2216.28,especially from nucleus basalis
in,"the front of the brain,"
2218.62,is the reason why it
can,increase our ability
2221.38,"to focus on particular types of endeavors,"
2224.26,"particular mental work that we're doing,"
2225.85,or maybe even particular physical work.
2227.71,Although I should mention
anytime,I'm pairing the words
2230.2,"nicotine and physical work,"
2231.82,it's obvious that because of the ways
2233.74,"that smoking impairs lung function,"
2236.26,those two things really
run,counter to one another.
2238.41,"In other words,"
2239.243,if you are thinking about
ingesting,nicotine through smoking
2241.99,or vaping in order to
improve,"physical performance,"
2244.713,that's a terrible idea.
2246.46,The logic isn't there
and,the health detriments
2248.44,are certainly there.
2249.273,The third neurochemical pathway
that's,strongly activated
2252.67,when nicotine is brought into
the,central nervous system
2256.05,"into the brain is epinephrine,"
2258.01,"or in particular norepinephrine,"
2259.33,which is related to epinephrine.
2260.62,"Now, earlier I said epinephrine"
is,the same as adrenaline.
2263.23,That's still true.
2264.31,Norepinephrine is closely
related,"to epinephrine,"
2266.32,"and for today's discussion,"
2267.46,we're going to use them interchangeably.
2268.9,Although I realize as I say that
2271.21,that the medical students
and,some biology students are
2273.25,probably going to have a minor seizure
2274.9,when I lump norepinephrine
and,epinephrine.
2277.12,I don't do that to be
too,"much of a lumper,"
2280.0,"in science, we talk about"
lumpers,and splitters.
2281.86,Lumpers are people that like
to,"oversimplify a little bit,"
2284.08,splitters are people that
really,like to detail.
2285.97,You'll see a lot of
splitters,on social media
2287.89,"from time to time, they'll say, wait,"
2289.39,you didn't mention the alpha
two,beta six receptor yet.
2293.14,"Okay look, I get it."
2294.61,And I am all for having
splitters,"in the room,"
2297.13,but for sake of today's discussion
2298.93,and for ease of digestibility
of,"some of this,"
2302.02,just want to point out
that,"norepinephrine,"
2303.58,"epinephrine, and adrenaline,"
2304.84,I'm going to treat as a common
pool,"of similar, in fact,"
2307.99,very similar molecules that
all,"have the same net effect,"
2311.74,at least in the context of this discussion
2313.24,and that's to increase levels
2314.65,"of alertness, energy, and arousal."
2317.05,And the way that nicotine
accomplishes,those increases in
2319.72,alertness and arousal and
energy,within the brain is by
2323.17,triggering the release of
no,epinephrine from a little
2325.03,cluster of neurons in
the,back of the brain
2326.44,"called locus coeruleus,"
2328.48,tiny cluster of neurons that
offers,"up, or I should say has,"
2332.62,because they're always there from birth
2335.02,"has these little wires,"
these,"axons that extend many,"
2338.08,"many places in the brain, not every place,"
2339.82,but virtually every place
2341.05,and can sprinkler the
brain,"with norepinephrine,"
2343.48,"essentially serve as a wake up signal,"
2345.52,elevating levels of energy.
2347.32,And when that combines
with,the acetylcholine
2349.728,"from nucleus basalis, which"
causes,"attentional spotlighting,"
2354.07,"increases in concentration and focus,"
2356.53,and with the feel good
properties,of dopamine
2359.137,and the motivating properties
of,dopamine released
2361.63,from the mesolimbic reward pathway.
2363.76,Now you can start to get
a,picture of why nicotine
2367.42,is such a powerful molecule.
2370.18,It's making people feel
motivated,and good.
2372.07,It's making people feel focused
and,it makes people feel
2375.82,alert when they would otherwise
feel,a little bit sleepy.
2378.49,So this is a really
powerful,"compound, in fact,"
2381.67,going back to our earlier
discussion,about focus
2383.98,"and some tools for focus,"
2385.15,and I encourage you if you're interested
2386.53,"to please check out the episode on focus,"
2388.09,there are a number of different tools
2389.77,and protocols there to increase focus.
2391.69,But here we are talking
about,"one molecule, nicotine,"
2396.58,found in plants like tomatoes and potatoes
2399.22,and the tobacco plant.
2400.81,And it can be synthesized
in,a laboratory and ingested
2403.87,through a patch or a gum or even a pill
2407.35,or a toothpick dipped in nicotine.
2409.48,One molecule that can trigger
activation,of all the circuits
2414.97,for focus and motivation
in,one fell swoop.
2419.14,That is remarkable. That
is,absolutely remarkable.
2422.17,And here we haven't even touched on
2423.19,some of the psychological
components,"of focus, right?"
2425.2,Whether or not we're
interested,"in something,"
2426.64,whether or not we're
excited,about it or not.
2428.92,"This is a very, very powerful system."
2431.38,"So powerful in fact,"
2433.03,that I think we can really place nicotine
2434.89,"right up there at the top,"
2437.02,right next to caffeine as the molecule
2440.08,that has fundamentally
changed,"human evolution,"
2444.28,"human consciousness, and human experience."
2446.77,Even if you're somebody who's
never,"ingested nicotine,"
2449.38,this absolutely has to be true
2450.82,because you have these
nicotinic,"receptors,"
2452.74,which is to say that acetylcholine
that's,naturally released
2455.56,without any external trigger
within,"your brain and body,"
2458.92,or I should say
2459.753,without any trigger from
nicotine,in particular
2462.34,is binding these nicotinic
acetylcholine,receptors
2465.52,and is creating these effects
in,"your brain and body,"
2467.83,just absolutely staggering.
2469.48,Now earlier I mentioned the
appetite,suppressing and indeed
2472.75,metabolism increasing effects of nicotine.
2475.63,And while that's a fairly niche component
2478.21,"of what nicotine does, I"
"mean,","it's an important one,"
2480.58,but it's not the major reason
2482.32,why most people consume nicotine.
2483.937,I'd like to take a moment
and,"talk about that now,"
2485.98,because we are in the
brain,and we're talking
2487.96,about the effects of
nicotine,in the brain.
2489.277,And so it seems to me the appropriate time
2491.26,to talk about this.
2492.16,Now we can have this
conversation,about nicotine
2494.53,and appetite and
metabolism,in a very simple
2496.57,and straightforward way.
2498.07,If you'd like to learn more
about,the biology of metabolism
2502.24,and appetite and how those things
2503.95,"are mediated by neural components,"
2506.23,so not just stuff like
your,"liver, et cetera,"
2508.24,"we have episodes on that,"
2509.26,but really the neural components
of,hunger and appetite.
2512.2,I encourage you to check out our episode
2513.55,on hunger and appetite.
2515.29,"But in that episode, we had a discussion."
2518.23,And it's one that I'll just
briefly,summarize now that you
2521.29,have a collection of neurons
that,sits right above the roof
2523.33,of your mouth or so
called,the hypothalamus.
2526.856,Hypo means below and
thalamus,"is right above it,"
2528.58,hypothalamus.
2529.54,So the small collection of
neurons,in the hypothalamus
2533.22,to a number of different
things,"related to sex behavior,"
2535.6,"aggression, mediating the"
temperature,"of your body,"
2538.66,"et cetera, but also appetite"
and,suppressing appetite.
2542.14,"And within the hypothalamus,"
2543.25,there's a compact collection
of,"these little neurons,"
2546.16,which we referred to as
the,"POMC, P-O-M-C neurons."
2549.01,And the name comes from the fact
2550.0,that they express certain peptides.
2551.23,"And we won't get into that now,"
2552.76,but the POMC neurons have
a,very profound impact on
2557.23,whether or not you feel hungry
2558.67,"or whether or not you do not feel hungry,"
2561.04,whether or not your
appetite,is suppressed.
2563.41,It turns out that when nicotine
gets,into the bloodstream
2565.57,"and then into the brain,"
2566.86,some of that nicotine binds to nicotinic
2570.64,alpha four beta two containing
nicotinic,receptors.
2573.85,"Again, these sub units of receptors,"
2575.2,but basically the nicotine binds some
2576.49,"of those parking spots, parks there."
2578.08,"And as a consequence,"
2579.07,these POMC neurons increase
their,electrical activity
2583.45,and appetite is suppressed.
2585.73,And that's because the POMC
neurons,have outputs to various
2589.09,areas of the brain and
body,controlling everything
2591.67,from how full we feel to whether or not
2595.21,"our blood sugar goes up or down,"
2597.4,"which can impact our hunger,"
and,"believe it or not,"
2600.16,whether or not we have a
tendency,to want to move the jaw
2602.65,of our mouth in order to chew food.
2604.75,"Yes, believe it or not,"
2605.83,the neural circuitry
associated,with appetite and
2608.29,suppression of appetite actually dictates
2610.75,"whether or not you prefer to,"
2612.7,or I should say are more
biased,or less biased
2615.46,"to moving your mouth, that is chewing."
2618.46,Which makes perfect
sense,when you hear it.
2620.68,One way to suppress appetite
2621.76,"is to sew the jaw shut neurally,"
2624.85,or at least make it less likely
2626.35,to open your mouth and put food in it.
2628.72,Actually that reminded me of a story.
2630.22,I'll just interrupt myself
to,tell a brief story that
2632.62,there's a famous Nobel Laureate
who,won the Nobel Prize
2635.23,for something totally
distant,from appetite.
2637.908,But once turned to a friend
of,"mine at a meeting and said,"
2640.57,I discovered the biological
mechanism,for losing weight.
2646.48,"And my friend said, well of course,"
2649.75,ingest fewer calories than you burn.
2651.37,"Calories in, calories out,"
2652.3,fundamental rule of thermodynamics.
2653.972,And basically the fundamental
rule,"of weight loss,"
2656.23,"weight gain, or weight maintenance."
2658.12,"And he said, no,"
2659.59,it's actually the gene
2661.48,that controls whether or
not,you open your mouth.
2663.94,Now he was making a very nerdy joke.
2665.83,"So if you didn't register that as a joke,"
2667.57,that's about as funny as
neuroscience,or biology jokes get.
2670.93,"There are a couple funnier ones,"
2671.83,but that one's kind of
considered,on the funnier side.
2673.66,So this is why we're not
considered,comedians.
2676.51,But the point of the matter is
that,whether or not you crave
2681.76,or desire or impulsively
want,to put things
2684.58,"in your mouth and chew it,"
2685.51,will actually dictate how
many,calories that you eat.
2687.76,And so I find it remarkable
and,indeed important to know
2690.49,that these POMC neurons
are,actually inhibiting
2692.89,the opening and the movement
of,the mouth for chewing.
2695.17,So when we smoke or
when,we ingest nicotine
2697.27,"in any other way,"
2698.47,you activate these POMC
"neurons,","you suppress appetite,"
2700.75,but in part you do that
by,actually limiting
2702.88,the impulse to chew.
2704.32,"Incredible, at least to me."
2705.94,Now in addition to limiting appetite
2708.13,by changing one's desire
to,ingest food and chew it
2711.37,and actual craving of food by regulation
2714.1,"of blood sugar, et cetera,"
2715.42,there do seem to be some quite
direct,effects of nicotine
2719.53,"on metabolism,"
2720.97,and the effects on
metabolism,aren't enormous.
2723.34,These are increases in metabolism
2725.11,"that are about 2% up to about 5%,"
2728.83,but I want to emphasize that those
2730.75,are transient increases in metabolism.
2733.93,"Nonetheless, people that"
quit,smoking often find
2737.44,"that their appetite goes up,"
they,sometimes gain weight.
2739.81,They sometimes do not depending
on,whether or not they
2741.94,offset that increase in
appetite,with increased physical
2744.37,exercise or with decrease
food,intake in other ways.
2747.31,But there does seem to
be,this direct effect
2749.08,"of ingesting nicotine on metabolism,"
2751.09,which I find is interesting
2752.47,"because if you look in the literature,"
2753.94,one of the reasons why
people,are reluctant
2757.09,to quit ingesting
"nicotine,","if for instance,"
2760.54,they want to quit using the
delivery,device to nicotine
2764.65,that's causing such problems
for,their health like smoking
2766.87,or vaping or whether or
not,they find themselves
2770.74,"quote unquote addicted to,"
2772.36,or have the habit of ingesting nicotine.
2775.48,"In part, that's likely due"
to,"be the dopamine effects,"
2779.08,because dopamine is highly
reinforcing,and rewarding.
2781.18,"It feels good, so people"
want,to do more of it.
2783.4,But it's also that for many
people,and here the data really
2786.55,point to the fact that a lot
of,the younger female smokers
2789.64,"or younger female vapers,"
or,"when I say that,"
2793.93,of course I mean younger
females,"that vape,"
2798.04,are doing that because they like
2799.75,"the appetite suppressing effects,"
2801.28,which of course opens up
an,entire conversation
2803.35,about the sociology of
body,"imagery, et cetera,"
2806.29,a topic for a future podcast.
2808.21,So nicotine has certain effects
on,the brain by virtue of
2812.53,the fact that nicotine binds
2814.39,these nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
2816.4,"And those receptors are found on some,"
2818.11,but not all neural
circuits,within the brain.
2820.24,And we talked about some of
them,"already, mesolimbic,"
2822.55,"the POMC neurons, et cetera."
2824.38,"Now when we ingest nicotine,"
2825.91,it goes from the bloodstream
to,all the tissues
2829.69,and organs of the body.
2830.77,"How does it do that? I mean, amazing."
2832.75,"It can pass to everything,"
the,"brain, the body,"
2835.63,it does that because
nicotine,is fat soluble.
2839.05,And now when anytime
people,"hear the word fat,"
2840.91,they tend to think about
body,"fat, subcutaneous fat,"
2843.7,or maybe they think about dietary fat.
2845.86,What I mean by fat soluble in
the,context of nicotine being
2848.65,fat soluble is that the cells of your body
2852.28,"have an outer layer,"
so-called,outer membrane.
2855.67,"And it's made up of lipid, of fat,"
2857.8,very particular types of lipids in fact.
2860.8,Nicotine has this remarkable
ability,to move through
2864.85,that fatty tissue.
2866.68,Not all molecules have that
"ability,",but nicotine does.
2870.37,So it can move relatively
freely,through the brain
2872.83,and body and relatively
freely,"from outside of cells,"
2876.25,extracellular space to
intracellular,space.
2879.28,"So it can get into cells, it"
can,do that within the brain.
2881.29,We talked about those effects
2882.34,and it can do that within the body.
2884.23,"Now anytime we're talking about the body,"
2886.3,we can be talking about
any,"number of things,"
2887.83,but today I'm going to
refer,to the periphery
2890.11,"and the body in more or less the same way,"
2891.88,but keep in mind in the back
of,"your head, pun intended,"
2896.62,"you have your brain, your"
"eyes,",and the spinal cord.
2900.13,And those three things make up
your,central nervous system.
2902.77,The peripheral nervous
system,"and the periphery,"
2904.72,"which is the rest of your body,"
2906.13,the contain your organs
and,so forth outside
2908.29,"of the nervous system,"
2909.58,things like your liver and
your,"stomach, et cetera,"
2911.74,that's what we're going to
talk,about now because nicotine
2914.59,has profound effects on
the,organs of the body
2917.41,"that are separate from,"
2918.82,but that occur in
parallel,at the same time
2921.58,as the effects of nicotine on the brain.
2924.13,So let's talk about what
some,of those effects are.
2926.08,When nicotine makes it into
the,"bloodstream, again,"
2928.03,"within two to 15 minutes of ingesting it,"
2930.13,"depending on the delivery device,"
2933.16,"your heart rate will increase,"
2935.65,"blood pressure will increase,"
2937.293,and the contractibility
of,the heart tissue
2940.12,will actually increase.
2941.92,So what that essentially
speaks,to is an increase
2945.58,in so-called sympathetic tone.
2947.23,"And when I say that,"
2948.063,I don't mean an increase in sympathy
2949.69,for others of the emotional sort.
2952.45,What I mean is an increase
in,the sympathetic activity
2955.75,of the sympathetic arm of
the,"autonomic nervous system,"
2958.06,which is real mouthful
and,mindful of ideas.
2961.6,But all you need to know is
that,it's a generalized system
2964.81,that increases levels of
alertness,and physical readiness.
2968.65,"So it makes you ready for action,"
2969.85,makes you ready for thought.
2971.56,It's balanced by a whole
other,system called
2973.51,"the parasympathetic nervous system,"
2975.22,which is basically the so-called
rest,"and digest system,"
2978.07,which is a system of neurons
and,"organs, et cetera,"
2980.65,that put your body and your
brain,into a state of not being
2983.92,"able to think clearly, to"
"digest,",and to fall asleep.
2987.25,"So nicotine increases heart rate,"
2989.65,"blood pressure, and"
contractibility,of the heart.
2991.6,So it's going to cause
more,"blood flow in theory,"
2994.6,although it also tends to
constrict,blood vessels
2998.08,in many locations in the body.
2999.67,This explains the decrease
in,penile girth effect
3003.12,"of nicotine, in particular"
3004.56,nicotine ingested by smoking or vaping.
3007.35,"That's right, smoking and"
vaping,reduces penis size
3011.58,and also will have damaging effects
3014.76,on the blood lining endothelial tissue.
3018.18,So over time it actually is
impairing,blood's ability to get
3021.12,to the penis chronically
3023.28,as well as to other organs of the body.
3025.2,"But when people ingest nicotine acutely,"
3027.84,and let's say they do
that,by Nicorette patch
3030.3,"or by toothpick dipped in nicotine,"
3032.46,"it will have some of these same effects,"
3034.5,"but when not smoking tobacco,"
3037.44,when bringing nicotine
into,the bloodstream
3039.33,"through other mechanisms,"
3040.83,"many, if not all of the"
disruption,of the endothelial cell
3043.5,"function can be bypassed, but"
the,"effects on penile girth,"
3049.38,the effects on reducing
blood,flow to various tissues
3052.08,is still present during
the,"effects of nicotine,"
3055.38,which as I mentioned last
about,one to two hours.
3057.54,"The half life is about one to two hours,"
3059.25,"depending on a number of factors,"
3060.81,not interesting for today's discussion.
3063.18,So when nicotine gets
into,"the bloodstream,"
3065.49,"it's making us more alert,"
3066.536,it's preparing our body for readiness.
3068.82,The heart is pumping harder.
3071.4,"Epinephrine, that is adrenaline,"
3073.11,"is released from the adrenal glands,"
3074.79,which right atop our kidneys.
3076.86,So everything is pointed
toward,creating more readiness
3080.73,"to move, more readiness to think."
3082.92,"And again,"
3083.753,this is happening in parallel
with,all the effects of
3085.56,neurochemistry that are
happening,with the brain
3087.21,that we talked about a few minutes ago.
3089.73,Now what's interesting about
nicotine,is that while it
3092.31,causes this global increase in readiness
3094.5,and alertness and attention
and,"mood, et cetera,"
3097.23,it also has the effect of
somewhat,relaxing skeletal muscle.
3102.06,Now that might seem
counterintuitive,to those of you out
3104.31,there that already know what I'm about
3106.11,to tell the rest of you who
didn't,"know it previously,"
3109.56,that your muscles are able to
3111.87,contract because of the effects
of,acetylcholine released
3117.03,from neurons in your spinal
cord,that spit out acetylcholine
3121.62,onto the muscle and bind to what?
3124.89,Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
3126.21,"Put into plain English,"
3127.498,nicotinic receptors are also the ways
3130.53,in which your muscles can get activated.
3132.75,"So therefore,"
3133.583,why would it be that increasing nicotine
3135.33,would cause relaxation of the muscles?
3137.79,And that has to do with some
of,the neural circuits that are
3140.16,upstream of the muscles and
has,to do with a little bit
3142.53,of how the autonomic
nervous,system is a range
3144.84,"in terms of which receptors go where,"
3146.52,a topic and kind of rabbit
hole,of a conversation
3149.55,"far too deep for right now,"
3151.38,at least in the context of
this,already somewhat detailed
3153.99,discussion of the effects of nicotine.
3155.94,But if we were to zoom out and just think
3158.4,"about the effects of nicotine,"
3159.81,we now have a very clear picture.
3163.05,Reward pathways are turned on.
3164.55,Attention is turned on.
Alertness,is turned on.
3167.61,You feel better than you
felt,a few minutes ago.
3169.98,Your blood pressure is
up.,Your heart rate is up.
3174.6,Your preparedness for
thinking,is elevated as well.
3179.49,And yet your body is somewhat relaxed.
3182.61,That's a very interesting
state,of mind and body.
3186.06,Interesting because it's somewhat
ideal,for cognitive work.
3191.4,Like if you were going to sit
down,and work on a book or you're
3193.8,going to sit down and try and
figure,"out a hard math problem,"
3196.35,or you're going to write a
letter,that's been really
3197.91,"challenging for you to write,"
3199.14,or maybe that you're
really,"excited to write,"
3201.75,but that you've been
3202.77,slow to get out the door
for,whatever reason.
3204.87,I'm talking about my own
habits,of procrastination.
3207.54,"Well that state of being very alert,"
3209.52,"but your body being relaxed is almost,"
3212.4,if not the optimal state for
getting,"mental work done,"
3216.33,because if you're feeling
agitated,in your body
3218.28,"and you want to physically move your body,"
3219.48,it's very hard to do cognitive work.
3220.8,At least the sorts of cognitive
work,that involve typing
3223.26,or writing or these sorts of things.
3225.24,It's also the exact opposite
of,the optimal state
3228.001,"for physical performance,"
3229.68,"which is one of yes, also alertness,"
3234.375,"yes, also motivation and elevated mood."
3235.74,That's all wonderful
stuff,"to have in mind,"
3238.74,literally when you are
exercising,or competing
3241.38,in sport or something of that sort.
3243.48,"But under those conditions,"
3244.65,you really also want to
have,"a fast reaction time,"
3248.19,a low latency for muscle
activation,so that you can make
3250.5,coordinated muscle movements
in,"the ways that you need to,"
3252.96,which is of course what's
required,of physical endeavors.
3255.72,"That tells us a few things, first of all,"
3257.01,it tells us that nicotine is
going,to be generally a bad
3260.22,idea for a pre-workout tool
3264.93,"or for enhancing physical performance,"
3268.38,"however, it's apt to be,"
3270.51,and in fact is an excellent tool
3272.49,for enhancing cognitive ability.
3274.44,"And of course,"
3275.273,that triggers my mind to
return,to the anecdote about
3277.83,my Nobel prize winning
colleague,who ingests nicotine
3281.07,by way of nicotine containing gum in order
3283.35,to increase levels of cognitive focus.
3285.45,Certainly not for going
out,and playing sport.
3287.55,"In fact, despite the fact"
that,"he is very, very tall,"
3291.0,he often points to himself
3294.557,in an appropriately funny way that
3297.561,despite being on the basketball
team,"of his high school,"
3298.77,he is probably the worst
player,that ever existed.
3300.99,And they only positioned him
there,because of his height.
3302.85,And I guess his head was
designed,to prevent balls
3306.09,from entering the basket.
3307.35,"In any event,"
3309.03,nicotine does seem to be very good
3311.01,"at enhancing cognitive function,"
at,"least in the short term,"
3314.49,which is not to say that it
isn't,"without its side effects,"
3316.74,which we will talk about.
3317.97,"And again,"
3318.803,those are side effects that
are,independent of smoking
3320.27,or vaping or other forms
of,ingesting nicotine.
3323.52,"For instance,"
3324.78,dipping or chewing tobacco
is,"known to cause a 50 fold,"
3329.58,"yes, 50 fold increase in mouth cancers,"
3333.15,things like leukoplakia and just generally
3336.36,is terrible for your health.
3337.47,"I'm sorry to break it to you,"
3338.49,but if you're dipping
or,you're using snuff
3341.31,"or things of that sort,"
3342.51,certainly I'm not going
to,tell people what to do.
3344.37,"That's not my role in life,"
3347.326,but you are dramatically
increasing,the probability of an
3350.58,oral cancer or of a mucosal
lining,cancer of some sort.
3354.15,So it's not just that smoking
3355.197,and vaping are bad for your health.
3356.91,These other forms of delivery for nicotine
3358.71,can be bad for your health as well.
3359.907,Now whether or not ingesting
nicotine,by way of nicotine
3362.64,containing gum or patch or
toothpick,or other method
3366.15,"is dangerous,"
3367.86,for other reasons is a discussion
3369.72,"that's important, right now,"
3371.22,it appears that provided the
dosages,are kept reasonable.
3376.77,We'll talk about what
reasonable,"means a little later,"
3378.87,and the frequency is kept relatively low.
3381.66,So not relying on these things constantly.
3384.39,There may in fact
3385.223,be some benefit to ingesting
nicotine,"from time to time,"
3387.75,provided that you are not
still,developing your brain.
3392.4,"Now in reality,"
3393.42,neuroplasticity goes on
throughout,the lifetime.
3396.0,Your life is actually one
long,developmental arc.
3397.92,It's not like development
occurs,"and then stops,"
3400.29,but certainly for people
before,"puberty, during puberty,"
3403.2,and probably for the next 15
to,"20 years after puberty,"
3407.22,avoiding nicotine is probably a good idea.
3409.83,"Now of course, development"
is,your entire life.
3412.26,It's not like development
starts,"and then ends,"
3413.82,but certainly for people that
are,"25 years old or younger,"
3418.14,ingesting nicotine as a way
to,enhance cognitive function
3420.84,is probably not the best idea.
3422.43,"And certainly, please,"
3423.99,for those of you that are
15,"years old or younger,"
3427.41,"ingesting nicotine in any form,"
3429.15,unless it's prescribed by your doctor
3430.59,"for a very specific clinical reason,"
3433.2,to me seems just like a terrible idea
3435.3,based on all the data that I've read.
3437.04,And the reason for that is
it's,going to create a scenario
3439.74,of nicotine dependence in order
to,achieve heightened levels
3442.32,"of mood and alertness, et"
"cetera,",and that's bad.
3445.26,And what we're effectively talking about
3446.42,"is an addiction for nicotine directly,"
3448.47,not necessarily the delivery device method
3450.75,"like smoking or vaping,"
3451.74,although it could pull
that,in as an addictive
3453.84,"or habit forming behavior as well,"
3455.82,but you want to let your
neural,circuits develop
3457.83,"to the point where again,"
3459.93,unless there's a clinical
need,for a prescribed drug
3462.808,from a licensed physician
or,"psychiatrist, et cetera,"
3464.7,that you're not relying
on,chemical enhancement
3467.64,of these circuits.
3469.098,For people who are 25
years,"or older, and again,"
3473.91,"that's not a strict cutoff,"
but,"roughly 25 years or older,"
3476.7,but for those of you that are
thinking,about using nicotine
3480.15,to enhance cognitive function as adults
3483.06,and your brain development
is,"slowing down, right."
3486.06,"Never ceases,"
3486.893,but is slowing down or has
slowed,down to the point
3489.9,where we would say developmental
plasticity,is largely over
3493.05,and you're now operating
3494.67,in the context of adult neuroplasticity.
3497.91,"Well, in that case,"
3498.99,there may be instances in which increasing
3502.59,"acetylcholine, dopamine, et cetera,"
3504.06,by way of nicotine ingestion
might,"be a good idea,"
3506.97,"but certainly not by smoking, vaping,"
3508.92,or by direct contact of tobacco
to,the mucosal lining tissue
3512.91,"of the mouth or nose, so"
called,dipping or snuffing.
3515.7,"For the last 20 minutes or so,"
3517.05,we've been talking about
the,biology of nicotine
3518.91,"specifically, how it impacts the brain,"
3520.83,"how it impacts the body,"
why,"it feels so good,"
3522.99,why it can enhance focus.
3524.49,And we've largely set
aside,"smoking, vaping,"
3528.87,"dipping tobacco, and snuffing,"
3531.03,and the negative effects
that,those all have
3533.64,on mental and physical health.
3535.59,Working down from the top of the head
3536.91,"to the bottom of the feet, we"
can,"say that smoking, vaping,"
3541.02,"dipping, and snuffing negatively"
impact,every organ and
3544.8,tissue system and cell of the
body,by virtue of the fact
3548.22,that they all damage
the,endothelial cells.
3551.4,"Again, the endothelial cells are the cells"
3553.14,"that make up the vasculature,"
3554.7,which delivers blood and other nutrients
3558.15,to all the cells and organs
and,tissues of the body.
3561.06,And those endothelial cells
are,strongly and negatively
3564.6,impacted by all of the
practices,that I just described.
3568.557,Now the way that that happens
3569.39,varies a little bit from each
one,"to the next, for instance,"
3572.67,it has been estimated
that,cigarettes contain
3575.16,"anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 toxins."
3578.43,Now the word toxins is a
real,"buzzword these days,"
3580.44,you hear about detoxes and
"toxins,","but more specifically,"
3584.55,we know that it contains carcinogens.
3586.92,These are cancer promoting compounds.
3589.41,"For instance,"
3590.46,"we know that the tar in cigarettes,"
even,"low tar cigarettes,"
3593.79,"as well as the ammonia within cigarettes,"
3595.74,as well as the formaldehyde
contained,"within cigarettes,"
3598.83,as well as the carbon
dioxide,that's generated
3600.87,from smoking those cigarettes
are,all carcinogens.
3604.02,Carbon dioxide also has the
negative,effect of depleting
3607.29,the amount of oxygen that's
delivered,to any and all
3609.6,of our tissues by way of the impact of
3612.54,carbon dioxide binding hemoglobin
and,preventing hemoglobin
3616.68,from delivering oxygen to
the,tissues of the body.
3619.47,"So while there may be 4,000"
or,"4,500 or 7,000 toxins,"
3623.49,"depending on which cigarette,"
3624.66,"which papers they happen to be rolled in,"
3626.55,whether or not they're
filtered,"or non-filtered,"
3628.38,"the type of tobacco, et cetera, et cetera,"
3631.83,there are a tremendous number of toxins.
3633.48,And there are some very potent carcinogens
3635.85,within that long list of toxins.
3637.89,"Again, ammonia, tar, formaldehyde,"
3640.29,and carbon dioxide being the most potent
3642.36,of those carcinogens.
3643.71,Now the fact that there are
carcinogens,in cigarettes
3645.69,sometimes lead cigarette
smokers,and particularly the
3648.27,cigarette smokers that have
the,hardest time quitting or
3650.49,that enjoy their cigarettes
the,"most from saying, well,"
3653.01,"listen, everything is a carcinogen"
or,everything kills you.
3655.14,Well certainly that's
not,a true statement.
3658.8,And while there are other
carcinogens,"in the environment,"
3661.5,so it environmental hazards like solvents.
3664.38,And even if you work in a
"laboratory,","for instance,"
3667.14,"we use in the laboratory,"
DNA,"intercalating dyes,"
3669.9,these are literally dyes
that,allow us to see the DNA
3672.27,structure of cells and see the proteins
3674.07,they make and see the RNAs they make.
3676.2,And it's very important to wear gloves
3677.52,"when you work with those things,"
3678.42,because as the name
"suggests,","they intercalate,"
3681.229,they actually get in
between,the strands of DNA
3682.59,and separate them.
3683.7,"They are mutagens, they mutate DNA."
3686.22,They are often carcinogens as well.
3687.87,"So we have them in our laboratory,"
3689.16,but we take certain precautions
to,not have them negatively
3691.71,"impact our health, safety"
protocols,and so on.
3695.13,We hear that there are
carcinogens,in car exhaust
3698.16,and bus exhaust and in all sorts of things
3700.29,like pesticides and that's all true.
3702.3,"So in the argument of probabilities,"
3704.55,"one would say, well,"
3705.48,if there are all these other
carcinogens,"in the environment,"
3708.09,why would you compound
their,carcinogenic effect
3711.39,by smoking or vaping
or,dipping or snuffing?
3714.51,But that usually doesn't get
people,to quit smoking or doing
3716.64,those things because of
the,powerful reinforcing
3718.5,effects of nicotine itself.
3720.18,"So again,"
3721.013,nicotine is the reinforcing element by way
3723.3,of triggering that dopamine
reinforcement,"pathway,"
3726.03,the mesolimbic reward pathway.
3727.74,And of course there are all
the,other additional effects
3731.4,"of increased focus,"
3733.11,such as increased ability to pay attention
3735.21,to work or to others that
lead,to other rewards.
3737.337,And so then it becomes a
situation,of compounding rewards.
3740.01,"So it's not really about the cigarette,"
3741.51,"it's about the nicotine,"
3742.343,"and it's not really about the nicotine,"
3743.61,it's about the dopamine
that,the nicotine evokes.
3745.62,And then it's not really
about,the dopamine
3747.21,"that the nicotine evokes directly per se,"
3750.03,but also about all the
positive,effects that
3751.95,that increased dopamine results in.
3754.53,So we can easily circle back
to,the negative effects of
3757.65,"smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing,"
3760.23,and say the endothelial
cells,are disrupted.
3763.56,The endothelial cells are
involved,in delivery of blood
3766.11,and other nutrients to every tissue
3767.43,of the body and smoking
"vaping,","dipping, and snuffing"
3771.06,"contain carcinogens, which"
are,cancer promoting.
3773.58,And because the epidemiological
studies,"are out there,"
3775.8,we can actually arrive at some
very,clear numbers as to how
3778.95,much life one will lose
from,ingesting nicotine
3783.84,"by way of those four delivery devices,"
3786.21,or I should say any one of
those,four delivery devices.
3789.42,Although I should also mention
that,many people who are
3791.43,vaping are also smoking cigarettes
3793.32,is becoming increasingly common.
3794.76,A lot of people are using
vaping,in one context
3796.86,"and cigarettes in another,"
3798.03,"dipping in one context, vaping in another."
3800.1,But even for those that
only,smoke or only vape
3803.19,"or only dip or only snuff,"
3805.47,the negative effects are
dramatic,and calculable.
3810.06,So it is thought that for every pack
3812.01,"of cigarettes consumed per day,"
3814.56,so you could average that
out,if you're a two a day
3817.08,cigarette smoker or a pack
a,"day cigarette smoker,"
3820.44,two pack a day.
3821.52,For every pack of
cigarettes,"smoked per day,"
3825.75,we can reliably estimate a 14
year,reduction in lifespan.
3831.45,So cigarettes are literally
peeling,years off your life.
3835.17,Now because of the way that the
brain,works and the way that
3838.08,human beings anticipate the
future,and can be grounded both
3842.4,in the present and the future
or,"the present and the past,"
3844.95,"that's just how the mind works, right?"
3846.21,"That's why we can think about the future,"
3847.56,but also realize where we
are,in time and space today.
3850.53,"Because of that, many"
people,"will say, well,"
3852.84,I enjoy cigarettes or I enjoy vaping.
3854.817,And so at least while I'm
"here,",I'm enjoying it.
3856.59,And that's because the dopamine system
3858.54,is not very good at
understanding,opportunity costs.
3862.77,That is what we would be
doing,in those 14 years
3865.53,and what we would be
enjoying,and the enrichment
3867.45,that we would get if we were
to,live into those 14 years.
3870.72,So at some level the smoker or vaper
3872.79,is being rational when they
"say,","yeah, but I enjoy this."
3875.79,"And so the years lost,"
3877.95,I can't really register that
because,it's hard to register
3880.38,what you don't have and
what,you've never had.
3883.08,"On the other hand,"
3884.61,we can also point to the
statistic,that there is
3887.64,this 50 fold increase in
mouth,cancers from dipping.
3891.27,And there are nasal cancers as well
3893.43,that are greatly increased
by,"snuffing and from smoking,"
3898.05,and now we know based on
data,from vaping that the
3902.04,endothelial cell damage
and,the direct effects
3905.58,"of damage to the lungs from tars,"
3907.38,"and even if people are vaping,"
3908.76,which tends to have lower
tars,"than do cigarettes,"
3911.97,"even for people that are vaping,"
3913.65,"greatly increased probability of stroke,"
3917.13,of peripheral vascular disease.
3919.892,So this is peripheral
pain,"because remember,"
3922.051,"blood is delivering, not just blood,"
3922.98,but other nutrients and
it's,clearing things
3925.11,out from tissues.
3926.34,So there's an accumulation of
literally,toxins and debris
3929.46,that cells generate all
the,"time, which is healthy,"
3931.71,but then the normally is cleared away
3934.14,by the endothelial cells
3935.34,and by other cell types
of,"the immune system,"
3938.16,that's all increased in people that engage
3941.22,in these nicotine
delivery,device behaviors.
3944.97,"Rates of heart attack, rates of stroke,"
3947.13,rates of cognitive
decline,are all increased.
3949.95,"Now you might say cognitive decline,"
3951.06,I thought that nicotine increases
the,likelihood that we can
3954.72,maintain healthy neural
function,and cognitive capacity.
3957.51,It might even increase cognitive capacity
3959.313,in a potent way in the short
"term,",and indeed it does.
3961.92,"However,"
3963.39,cigarette smoking and vaping are now known
3966.21,to dramatically decrease
cognitive,function
3970.14,because one of the key
things,about the brain
3972.36,is that it is the most
metabolically,"demanding organ,"
3975.09,which means it consumes a lot of glucose.
3976.68,Or even if you're
"ketogenic,","you need ketones,"
3978.84,you need nutrients getting
to,the neurons in other cell
3981.15,types of the brain and nervous system
3982.8,in order for it to function properly.
3984.57,And when you disrupt a vasculature
through,this endothelial
3987.48,"cell dysfunction, you get"
things,"like interstitial,"
3990.24,which just means in the
spaces,between dysfunction.
3992.46,So it's not just beating up
3994.17,"the endothelial cells themselves,"
3995.61,but the spaces between the
cells,is being disrupted.
3998.16,There's a lot of debris
that,accumulates there.
3999.93,"And as a consequence,"
4001.55,the brain just simply
will,not function as well.
4004.4,So you start getting
short,"term memory lapses,"
4006.32,"you start getting working memory lapses,"
4007.82,working memory is the sort of memory
4009.32,if someone tells you their
seven,"digit phone number,"
4012.56,typically nowadays people
just,"share their info,"
4014.48,but seven digit phone number or a sequence
4016.28,of numbers or an address
4017.33,and your inability to remember that.
4018.74,So you're walking back to the
kitchen,sink and you can't
4020.57,remember what you were trying to remember
4022.49,"just a short moment ago,"
that's,working memory.
4024.56,"Working memory suffers, long term memory,"
4027.41,projective or intergrade
memories,into the future.
4030.53,How can you remember things in the future
4033.59,that haven't occurred yet?
4034.46,Well this is more of a memory
for,future plans or ideas
4038.66,and planning for things that are to come.
4040.73,So what we can very reliably
say,is that currently
4043.28,"more than 1 billion, billion,"
4045.8,more than 1 billion people consume tobacco
4049.25,in order to get their nicotine
4050.99,because that's really
the,reinforcing element
4053.18,"within tobacco,"
4055.13,more than 1 billion people
consume,tobacco in the form
4057.83,of cigarettes every day.
4061.04,"A growing number of people,"
4062.75,more than half a billion people
now,are starting to vape.
4066.95,The estimates range from
200,million to 500 million.
4070.55,And there's a lot of
debate,about this because
4072.29,a lot of people are
hybrid,"smokers and vapers,"
4074.96,meaning they do one or both
4077.03,"depending on time of day and location,"
4078.56,"as I mentioned before,"
4079.91,but now you start to see how
you,can get to the number
4084.17,that billions of people
are,consuming tobacco.
4086.54,Because of course you
also,have your people
4088.28,that are dipping and your
people,that are snuffing.
4090.41,"And as I mentioned before,"
4091.34,you have people that
are,engaging in multiple
4093.86,of these behaviors.
4095.57,"So billions of people on planet Earth,"
4098.6,anywhere from one eighth to
a,"quarter of human beings,"
4102.53,incredible right?
4104.0,Anywhere from one eighth to a quarter of
4105.62,human beings are consuming
tobacco,in one form or another
4108.86,in order to get their
nicotine,one way or another.
4112.79,"And as a consequence,"
4114.41,"are peeling years off their life,"
4116.068,dramatically increasing
the,"probability of cancer,"
4119.33,"stroke, heart attack,"
4121.61,"peripheral neuropathies,"
brain,"dysfunction,"
4125.39,"meaning cognitive dysfunction,"
memory,"impairment,"
4128.18,sexual dysfunction.
4129.89,There are a number of studies
4131.069,that have looked at increases in cortisol.
4132.71,"And while minor, those increases do exist."
4135.71,Decreases in growth
"hormone,","and while minor,"
4137.81,"those decreases exist,"
4140.33,but even setting aside the
negative,"impact on endocrine,"
4145.07,"on hormone factors,"
4146.81,"it's very, very clear"
that,"smoking, vaping,"
4151.19,"dipping, and snuffing are"
among,the worst things
4154.64,that we can do for our health.
4156.5,They are among the leading
causes,of preventable death
4159.77,"and debilitating life conditions,"
4163.31,which may lead you to the question as
4165.14,to why in the world would people do this?
4169.04,Well it turns out most
of,them don't want to.
4173.03,In the best surveys that one can find of
4176.665,"if you could quit smoking,"
4177.59,"if you could quit vaping, would you,"
4179.99,what you find is that at
least,"for cigarette smokers,"
4183.26,70% want to quit.
4187.58,They would love to quit.
4189.23,And yet they find that to
be,exceedingly difficult.
4191.99,And the reason they find it
to,be exceedingly difficult is
4194.72,because of all the brain neurochemistry
4196.64,that we talked about before.
4197.57,The reason I spent close
to,20 minutes talking about
4200.48,"dopamine and the mesolimbic pathway,"
4202.01,acetylcholine and nucleus
"basalis,","and epinephrine,"
4206.57,and the relaxation of muscles
in,the periphery and the
4208.88,increase in readiness
in,the body and brain is
4212.42,that all of those combine
to,make nicotine one
4214.88,of the most powerful and
potent,cognitive enhancers
4217.67,"and to some extent physical enhancer,"
4219.83,"although, as I mentioned before,"
4221.57,the total number of physical
exercise,or physical
4225.59,sport promoting effects of
nicotine,"is very, very small,"
4230.03,if not zero.
4231.77,There are certain conditions
under,which one might imagine
4234.92,using nicotine specifically
for,cognitive enhancement where
4239.21,performance of complex motor
skills,would sort of outweigh
4242.51,the negative effects on
the,"neuromuscular system,"
4245.09,our ability to generate
coordinated,movements.
4247.76,There was actually an excellent
study,looking at the effects
4250.1,"of nicotine, not by smoking delivery,"
4252.62,but by different delivery
mechanism,in which they looked at
4256.46,performance of hitters in baseball.
4259.49,The experiment was kind
of,"an interesting one,"
4261.23,even though these were fairly
skilled,"baseball players,"
4263.39,what they had them do
was,"hit a ball off a tee,"
4265.88,as I recall growing up and I admittedly
4268.67,"I didn't play much baseball,"
4269.69,but you start off on tee-ball and then
4271.67,"you would go, I think it"
was,to pitching machine.
4273.32,Then they would use actual
pitchers,who throw the ball.
4275.017,But in this case it was a couple
4277.49,of different baseball related tasks.
4279.23,"They'd have people hit the ball off a tee,"
4281.81,but they had to direct that hit
4283.55,toward a ball atop another tee.
4285.83,So it's fairly precise targeting that's
4287.66,required in order to knock
that,ball off the other tee.
4290.06,So this is an activity that
involves,"not just motor output,"
4292.7,"but coordinated motor output,"
4294.47,"and not just coordinated motor output,"
4296.72,"but directed, coordinated output"
4299.36,"that requires some, as we"
would,"say, top down processing."
4302.54,This isn't the kind of thing
that,can be done reflexively.
4304.85,This is the kind of thing
where,"the forebrain,"
4307.34,the prefrontal cortex in
particular,has to be heavily
4309.35,involved in order to
suppress,certain actions
4311.69,and then create other actions.
4313.25,So the basic takeaway of
the,study is that nicotine
4315.53,"delivered by way of nicotine gum,"
4318.02,"not by smoking, dipping,"
or,snuffing was able
4321.95,to increase cognitive
performance,and motor output.
4324.32,So a rare circumstance where
a,specific set of demands that
4329.18,involved both cognitive
engagement,and physical engagement
4332.9,showed a slight but
significant,improvement.
4335.6,"But again, in most cases,"
4337.67,nicotine is just simply not
going,to improve physical output
4341.3,if it's delivered through
a,"smoked cigarette,"
4344.96,"through vaping, through"
"dipping,",or through snuffing.
4347.81,So if all these behaviors
are,terrible for essentially
4350.78,every aspect of our
"health,","frankly, I mean,"
4352.7,"when you look at the literature,"
4353.533,it's terrible for pregnant
"women,","it's terrible for kids,"
4355.7,"it's terrible for older people,"
4357.38,it's terrible for younger people.
4358.91,You really cannot find a scenario
in,"which smoking, vaping,"
4362.96,"dipping, or snuffing are good for us."
4364.94,And yet people like the effects
on,the brain and they feel
4368.39,"quite addicted to them, even"
if,"they say they're not,"
4370.97,most of those people would
be,unwilling to give up their
4374.39,practice of nicotine delivery
for,more than a few hours.
4378.14,"In fact,"
4379.514,if you look at the effects of
withdrawal,and we are going
4380.69,to talk about what withdrawal
of,"nicotine looks like,"
4383.423,what you find is that
as,soon as four hours
4387.59,after the last ingestion of nicotine
4389.93,by way of cigarette or vaping
or,"dipping or snuffing,"
4393.47,what people start to experience
4394.99,"is some agitation, craving"
for,"nicotine, of course."
4398.27,And while craving is
kind,"of a vague concept,"
4400.85,it's actually a very specific
biological,mechanism.
4403.4,It's the drop in dopamine
that's,starting to occur
4406.88,so much so that there's a drop
in,dopamine below baseline.
4410.03,That is the increase in
dopamine,that would normally
4412.58,be experienced from
"smoking,","vaping, dipping,"
4415.67,or snuffing is now not happening.
4418.1,"And in fact, the levels of"
dopamine,are dropping below
4420.59,where they would've been even
4422.15,without performing that behavior.
4424.55,So that's what craving is.
4426.8,And withdrawal is an increased
sense,of that craving as well
4430.52,as a lot of negative stuff
like,stomach aches or nausea
4434.03,"or irritability, and often"
collections,of all of those.
4437.0,So because these nicotine
delivery,approaches
4438.92,"are so terrible for our health,"
4441.14,and also because as many as 70% of people
4445.07,"who smoke would like to quit,"
4447.05,but either feel they can't
because,they've tried
4449.27,"and failed repeatedly often,"
or,"because it's just too scary,"
4453.23,meaning the reinforcing
properties,are too strong and
4455.51,therefore they can't
imagine,living without them
4458.3,or the withdrawal effects are too strong
4461.0,and they can't imagine living with those.
4463.76,Well then is there hope
for,"quitting smoking,"
4466.733,"vaping, snuffing, or dipping?"
4469.34,"And the short answer, fortunately is yes,"
4471.92,there are excellent ways to do that.
4473.36,And some of them are
single,event treatments.
4476.93,And we're going to talk
about,"those shortly,"
4479.54,"but before we do that,"
4480.38,"I want to highlight one very brief point,"
4482.48,which is that nicotine is
not,the cause of cancer.
4486.62,"Nicotine is not the carcinogen,"
4488.72,it's the other things
in,tobacco or associated
4493.43,with the nicotine delivery
device,that are causing cancer.
4497.39,And I should mention the
other,negative impacts
4500.57,on our health in particular
4501.654,by way of disrupted endothelial
blood,vessel function.
4506.09,"Now that leads us to this issue of vaping,"
4507.95,"because as many of you know,"
4509.63,and probably are thinking
as,I've been delivering
4512.0,"this information, people"
don't,vape tobacco.
4516.77,The way that vaping pens
are,designed is that
4519.98,"it includes some liquid, it involves heat,"
4522.8,and it does not involve
the,burning off of tobacco.
4525.65,"In fact, there's a constant"
updating,of the engineering
4529.7,of these vape pens so that
they,can be very low heat.
4533.02,In some cases they use even
non,heating approaches to
4537.62,vaporize the nicotine and allow it
4539.69,to enter the bloodstream very quickly.
4542.63,"I must say in a lot of ways,"
vaping,resembles crack cocaine.
4547.76,The reason why vaping and
crack,cocaine are so similar
4551.18,is the speed of entry of
nicotine,into the bloodstream.
4555.17,"This isn't an episode about cocaine,"
4557.42,but I just want to very briefly
touch,on some of the delivery
4560.18,routes for cocaine because they parallel
4562.58,a lot of the delivery routes for nicotine.
4565.16,And we can learn a lot about
4566.9,drug pharmacokinetics and dopamine
4569.63,if we look at the parallels
between,cocaine and nicotine.
4574.25,I'll preface this by saying
cocaine,is a terrible drug.
4578.36,It is actually a schedule two
drug,"in the United States,"
4581.18,"which means that it has a very,"
4582.77,very limited yet still
present,"medical application,"
4586.01,mainly as an anesthetic
in,certain laboratory
4589.7,and hospital conditions.
4591.56,"But aside from that,"
4592.94,it's very clear that cocaine
is,one of the most debilitating
4595.49,drugs that humans can
use,because of the way
4597.86,that it impacts the dopamine system.
4599.63,And it basically creates a
loop,whereby the only thing
4603.17,that can really trigger
dopamine,release is cocaine.
4606.89,"And as I've said before,"
4608.48,the way that I define
addiction,is it's a progressive
4611.21,narrowing of the things
that,bring people pleasure.
4613.37,Cocaine certainly falls into the category
4615.44,"of addictive drugs,"
strongly,addictive drugs.
4618.77,"And in fact,"
4619.603,it has the additionally pernicious feature
4621.56,that after using cocaine
for,"some period of time,"
4624.89,the amount of dopamine that's
released,becomes progressively
4627.5,lower and lower and lower so
that,people can never get back
4630.44,to a state in which dopamine
release,is ever as great
4633.89,as it was the first time they did cocaine
4635.63,or prior to doing cocaine.
4637.345,Now with a long period of
no,cocaine use whatsoever
4643.13,and protecting the dopamine system
4645.86,"in a number of different ways,"
4647.42,"people can often, not always but often"
4650.42,"recover their dopamine system,"
4652.73,if not completely then near completely.
4656.285,"So by all means, if you have"
a,"problem with cocaine, quit,"
4659.03,"find a way to quit, get treatment,"
4661.13,get over that one way or another.
4662.81,"We have an episode with an expert guest,"
4664.94,"Dr. Anna Lembke,"
4666.35,who's a physician and the chief
4667.91,of the Stanford School of Medicine
4669.59,"dual diagnosis addiction clinic,"
4671.81,a world expert in dopamine
and,addictive substances
4674.81,and addictions of all kinds.
4676.22,You can find that episode
at,hubermanlab.com.
4678.724,It's filled with information
about,how to get over different
4681.32,"types of addictions,"
including,cocaine addiction.
4683.15,Also check out her absolutely phenomenal
4685.37,and indeed important
book,"""Dopamine Nation"","
4687.26,which touches on some of this as well.
4689.72,And in the show note
captions,for the episode
4692.0,"where Dr. Lembke was my guest,"
4694.16,you can also find some additional
resources,related to that.
4696.59,So cocaine is terrible. That
needs,to be acknowledged.
4699.35,It should be avoided and you
should,find a way to quit it
4701.81,if you are currently using.
4704.42,"With that said,"
4705.77,the delivery mechanism for
cocaine,strongly parallels
4709.04,the delivery mechanisms for nicotine.
4710.93,"That is people will snort cocaine,"
4712.64,which is a lot like snuffing or dipping.
4714.74,"That is when people snort cocaine,"
4716.3,they're bringing cocaine into
proximity,"or into contact,"
4718.82,really with the mucosal
lining,"of the nasal passages,"
4721.88,which then allows the
psychoactive,substances
4724.67,to permeate into the bloodstream.
4727.01,"Very seldom do people eat it,"
4729.14,although that does
happen,"from time to time,"
4732.14,"people will inject it,"
as,"so-called mainlining,"
4735.11,which is a very rapid entry
into,the bloodstream because
4737.72,it's direct application to the bloodstream
4739.73,by way of injection.
4741.59,"And then there's crack cocaine,"
4742.423,which is essentially like
a,vaporizing of the cocaine
4745.61,"from a so-called cocaine rock,"
4747.71,that somewhat resembles
vaping,of nicotine.
4752.69,So while the vape pen
involves,"a liquid that's sold,"
4755.87,a cartridge that contains nicotine
4757.76,and often other flavors as
"well,","flavorings I should say,"
4763.37,both crack cocaine and
vaping,cause very rapid
4767.24,increases in the relative substances
4769.13,"that are psychoactive,"
in,"the case of cocaine,"
4770.81,that would be cocaine and
the,increase in dopamine
4773.51,in the brain and body I should mention.
4775.55,"And in the case of vaping,"
4777.08,there's a very rapid increase
4778.73,"in blood concentrations of nicotine,"
4780.32,much faster than occur
with,cigarette smoking
4783.38,or other modes of nicotine delivery.
4785.84,So that speed of onset turns
out,to be a critical parameter
4789.8,because the speed of onset
of,nicotine is going to also
4793.79,determine the speed of release of dopamine
4796.0,in the nucleus accumbens
and,"ventral tegmental area,"
4798.23,that mesolimbic reward pathway.
4800.57,"And with the mesolimbic reward pathway,"
4802.22,"it's not just about the peak,"
4804.47,meaning the maximal amount
of,"dopamine that's released,"
4808.25,"but it's the time course,"
how,"steep the curve is,"
4811.07,how quickly that dopamine increases
4812.72,"that's going to determine how reinforcing,"
4815.24,how habit forming and indeed how addictive
4817.58,a particular substance is.
4819.95,One of the major important
differences,between vaping and
4822.47,cigarette smoking is that the onset
4824.42,of dopamine release from vaping is faster.
4827.66,And even a subtle increase
in,the rate at which dopamine
4831.23,increases in the mesolimbic
reward,pathway can make a given
4836.06,amount of nicotine much more
habit,forming and addictive.
4840.8,Now this probably explains
the,"fact that many,"
4843.83,"many more people, in particular,"
4845.12,young people age 25 and younger
4847.37,are vaping at phenomenal rates.
4850.34,People are starting to vape
in,just about everywhere.
4852.83,"You see this in restaurants,"
you,"see it on the street,"
4854.78,indeed you even see it in the classroom.
4857.27,This has actually become
sort,of sport of sorts.
4860.36,Certainly not something I encourage.
4862.04,"In fact, when I learned about this from"
4865.465,a new college student is telling me
4866.75,that many college students are
actually,bringing vape pens
4869.27,into the classroom.
4870.103,I think this is also
happening,in high schools
4871.88,and even junior high schools.
4873.86,This is a really concerning practice.
4876.56,And here I'm not trying to come across as
4878.81,"the anti vaping crusader,"
4880.1,but I must say given the negative effects
4882.56,"on one's health in the long term,"
4884.3,but also given these exceedingly
powerful,reward properties
4888.08,of nicotine entering
the,"bloodstream quickly,"
4890.81,and dopamine being released very quickly
4893.36,"from the mesolimbic reward pathway,"
4895.7,what we're seeing out
there,makes total sense.
4898.34,Young people's brains are
essentially,getting wired
4902.03,to the expectation that dopamine
is,going to be increased
4905.24,dramatically and quickly
under,"their control,"
4908.24,except it's under their control
4910.16,only in a very narrow
set,of circumstances.
4912.5,"Recall the definition of addiction,"
4914.36,a progressive narrowing of the things
4916.37,that bring you pleasure.
4917.203,We can change that statement
to,also say a progressive
4921.8,"narrowing and specific kinetics,"
4925.13,that is specific time course of the things
4928.01,that bring you pleasure.
4929.21,Now that's a bit of a
nerdier,statement than
4930.95,a progressive narrowing of the things
4932.09,that bring you pleasure.
4932.923,But what we are going to
see,"in the next few years,"
4935.57,I believe is an entire
generation,of young people
4939.02,for which a very large percentage
of,them are going to be
4942.77,seeking out a pattern or feeling
4945.56,"because to the person taking it,"
4946.7,they're not looking at
their,dopamine levels
4948.23,rising in their blood.
4949.31,They're experiencing this
as,"an increase in focus,"
4951.22,"an increase in alertness,"
4952.27,an increase in mood and
wellbeing,"that is very rapid,"
4956.3,"very dramatic,"
4957.59,and that simply cannot be
recreated,by any other substance.
4961.97,"And that's a very concerning scenario,"
4964.58,concerning because that
mesolimbic,reward pathway
4967.64,"is the only pathway,"
4969.47,the only pathway by which
you,can achieve the rewarding
4973.19,"properties of any kind of endeavor,"
4975.56,not just vaping of course.
4977.93,It is the way in which people
achieve,satisfaction from
4980.93,reaching a relationship
goal,or an athletic goal
4984.05,"or an educational goal,"
4985.85,any kind of goal or sense of satisfaction.
4988.22,And so it comes as no surprise
that,vaping is strongly
4991.64,associated with increased
levels,"of depression,"
4994.46,especially when vaping use drops off.
4996.59,Why would that be?
4997.49,If people are getting
so,much more dopamine
4999.29,"so much more quickly from vaping,"
5000.7,shouldn't they be feeling better?
5002.023,That brings us back to the
"critical,","and I should say,"
5005.47,defining feature of the
dopamine,reward pathway
5008.11,"for motivation and wellbeing,"
5009.91,which is that initially a
given,"substance will cause,"
5013.12,let's say an eight out of
"10,","again, arbitrary units,"
5015.94,but eight out of 10 increase in dopamine.
5019.15,"But with repeated use,"
5020.56,what ends up happening
is,that even at similar
5023.53,"or higher levels of ingestion,"
5025.33,"so not just one inhalation a minute,"
5027.4,but maybe two inhalations a minute
5028.7,or an inhalation every 30 seconds.
5031.57,Now it's level four out of 10 activation
5034.18,of dopamine and then three and then two.
5035.8,And eventually it drops below baseline.
5038.08,Now the whole system can be recovered
5039.37,"by abstinence from nicotine consumption,"
5042.79,but the dopamine system
is,"applied to everything,"
5045.01,"all sense of wellbeing,"
all,sense of motivation.
5047.62,So during the period in
which,one is abstaining
5050.35,"from nicotine and vaping in particular,"
5053.77,people do not feel good.
5055.12,They feel miserable. That's
why,it's called withdrawal.
5057.16,It's associated with a
bunch,of psychological and
5060.61,physiological symptoms that all lead back
5064.06,to trying to get to the same
levels,of dopamine release
5067.6,in the same patterns that were experienced
5069.94,when one initially started vaping.
5072.16,So I'm not trying to paint a
dark,"picture here, but frankly,"
5074.65,the picture is very dark.
5076.63,I'm very concerned about a
practice,of ingesting something
5080.35,that powerfully modulates the
dopamine,system with the sorts
5083.35,of kinetics that one sees from
ingestion,of crack cocaine
5085.99,in young people that has all
these,other negative health
5088.3,effects that in the short term
is,"very powerfully rewarding,"
5091.3,"increased focus, wellbeing, et cetera,"
5093.49,but that over a very brief
period,of time leads to a state
5097.12,in which the entire dopamine
reward,system is impaired and
5101.92,can become permanently impaired
5103.84,unless one intervenes in
a,very deliberate way.
5106.87,So people are directly
controlling,the rate of dopamine
5109.99,and the frequency of dopamine
release,by the duration
5112.96,and frequency of inhalations
off,the vape pen.
5116.8,And that's an incredible thing
because,what it does is it
5120.34,sets up the mesolimbic reward
pathway,for an expectation
5123.43,that dopamine will be
delivered,on that schedule.
5126.61,So that's one of the things
5128.29,that makes vaping in
particular,so hard to quit.
5132.569,Vaping is actually harder to quit
5134.86,than cigarette smoking for most people.
5137.335,Now does that mean that cigarette smoking
5139.57,is fairly easy to quit for most people?
5141.94,No.
5143.29,70% of people who smoke cigarettes report
5145.36,that they would like to quit
if,they thought they could.
5148.9,The success rate of quitting smoking
5151.15,"when people try to go just cold turkey,"
5153.16,just quit with no assistance whatsoever.
5154.93,"They might tell their family and friends,"
5156.25,"hey, I'm quitting, that's it,"
5158.602,"is exceedingly low, it's 5%."
5161.41,"So 5% of the people that say, that's it,"
5164.86,I'm not smoking again.
5166.03,"Despite cancer diagnosis,"
I'm,not smoking again.
5168.97,Despite the fear of the
negative,"health effects,"
5170.71,I'm not going to ever smoke again.
5172.69,Despite the financial
"cost,",the health cost.
5176.898,I could list off a huge
number,of things that it does
5178.793,"that are negative,"
5179.626,but you already know these
or,"you've heard them,"
5181.84,"it makes your skin worse, as"
I,"mentioned it lowers libido,"
5185.77,"it disrupts hormones,"
5186.88,it disrupts vascular
"function,",brain function.
5190.63,It does all these terrible things.
5191.83,And yet most people who
try,and quit simply can't.
5194.29,"And of the 5% that succeed in quitting,"
5196.99,a full 65% of them relapse within a year.
5200.59,"So that's a very depressing picture,"
5202.9,but it's not to say
that,people cannot quit.
5204.787,"And in fact, they can."
5205.99,There are a couple of methods
5207.01,that have been shown to help people quit.
5209.44,Some are behavioral and
some,are pharmacologic.
5213.07,I just want to touch on the
behavioral,ones first because it
5215.71,turns out that there's
a,quite powerful method
5218.86,for quitting nicotine ingestion
by,"way of cigarette smoking,"
5222.79,which also carries over to vaping.
5224.77,This is beautiful work that's
been,"done by my colleague,"
5227.53,"in fact, close collaborator,"
5228.76,although I was not
involved,in the research
5230.26,that I'm about to describe at Stanford.
5232.21,And his name is Dr. David Spiegel.
5233.88,He is our associate chair of psychiatry.
5236.59,He's been a guest on the
Huberman,"Lab Podcast,"
5238.57,"and he is a world expert,"
5240.16,if not the world expert
5241.84,in the clinical applications of hypnosis.
5244.18,"Now when I say hypnosis,"
5245.29,"a lot of people think stage hypnosis,"
5247.0,which is the hypnotist
5247.9,trying to get people to do certain things
5249.73,"and say certain things,"
5250.96,not necessarily against their will
5252.94,because they actually have to agree.
5254.17,But the hypnotist is dictating
5256.03,"what the person thinks, says, and does."
5258.88,Clinical hypnosis is
vastly,different from that.
5261.91,"Clinical hypnosis is where the person,"
5264.46,the patient actually directs
their,own brain changes toward
5268.33,a specific emotional or behavioral goal.
5271.15,Work from Dr. David Spiegel's
laboratory,"done in 1993,"
5275.38,"but that now has been repeated many,"
5277.03,many times that has carried
over,into some more modern
5279.16,studies and I will provide
links,to those studies
5281.95,in the show note captions
so,that you can access them.
5284.77,Those studies have shown that
5286.24,"using a specific form of hypnosis,"
5289.84,people can achieve complete
5292.63,and total cessation of cigarette smoking.
5295.72,And there's no reason to
believe,this doesn't also carry
5297.91,over to vaping through one
single,hypnosis session.
5301.78,And the success rates are
incredibly,high when one considers
5305.23,that normally it would be
only,a 5% success rate.
5308.29,The success rate with this
particular,hypnosis developed
5311.17,at Stanford School of Medicine
5312.31,by Dr. David Spiegel is 23%
5315.58,of people who do this hypnosis one time
5318.01,succeed in quitting smoking.
5319.63,"Now in the old days,"
5321.82,"which actually wasn't that long ago,"
5323.62,before the advent of smartphones
5325.72,and before the internet took off
5327.79,"to the extent that it has now,"
5330.37,this was done by having
someone,come into the clinic
5333.633,and Dr. Spiegel himself
5334.466,or one of his colleagues
would,take somebody
5336.13,through the hypnosis.
5338.29,"Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis."
5340.6,There's a wonderful app that was developed
5342.97,by Dr. David Spiegel and others.
5345.28,"It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I."
5347.86,I've talked about this app a few times
5349.09,"on the podcast before,"
5350.05,because there are hypnosis
scripts,within the app for
5352.48,"enhancing sleep, for improving"
ability,of fall asleep
5354.94,if you wake up in the middle
of,"the night, for focus,"
5357.19,and a number of other behavioral
and,emotional changes.
5360.55,There's also a function in the Reveri app
5363.04,"for smoking cessation,"
5364.69,which exactly parallels
the,sort of in laboratory
5368.92,and in clinic approaches
that,Dr. Spiegel would use
5371.98,were you to show up at his
clinic,or his laboratory.
5374.47,And since that's not possible
5375.94,"for the large number of people out there,"
5377.89,if you or somebody else
is,trying to quit smoking
5380.74,or vaping or dipping or
snuffing,"for that matter,"
5385.18,I strongly encourage you to
check,out the Reveri app.
5387.88,You can find it easily
by,going to reveri.com.
5390.82,It's available in various formats.
5393.508,"Some of it is available free,"
5394.341,"some of it is behind a paywall,"
5395.62,but given the tremendously negative impact
5397.93,"of smoking, vaping, dipping, and snuffing,"
5401.29,the hypnosis for smoking
cessation,that Reveri has seems
5405.79,at least to me as a very
powerful,and worthwhile resource.
5409.63,So please check that out
5410.62,if you're somebody who's trying
to,quit ingesting nicotine
5413.89,by any of the four methods
that,I just described.
5416.62,"Now of course,"
5417.453,there are other methods
that,people have used to
5418.48,successfully quit smoking or vaping
5420.28,or other forms of nicotine delivery.
5423.01,And there's actually an
excellent,review on this topic.
5425.41,So before diving into a few
of,the specifics about some of
5427.78,the pharmacology of using nicotine itself
5431.26,to quit smoking or nicotine
itself,"to quit vaping,"
5434.08,"or the use of various things, even SSRIs,"
5436.69,antidepressants to quit smoking or vaping.
5440.41,I just want to point you to a
review,article that if you'd
5442.51,like to get a complete
survey,of all the options
5445.0,"that are available, there's"
an,excellent review on this.
5447.73,It was published just a
couple,of years ago in 2020.
5449.857,And the title of the article is
5451.157,"""Pharmacologic Approach"
to,Smoking Cessation:
5453.91,An Updated Review for
Daily,"Clinical Practice""."
5456.58,And even though this is mainly
focused,"on smoking cessation,"
5459.88,it carries over quite nicely to vaping.
5462.43,"And it details a number of statistics,"
5464.29,"the fact that every year,"
5465.7,"700,000 or more people die"
5467.5,because of smoking related diseases.
5468.97,So there again you have
5469.803,the negative health effects
that,"younger people are smoking,"
5473.38,that women are smoking more nowadays.
5474.97,"And that even though you see less smoking,"
5476.41,"typically in the US and Canada,"
and,"even in Northern Europe,"
5479.14,"some places, there are still"
many,many people are smoking
5481.45,"who would like to quit,"
but,"that 75% of people,"
5484.84,at least according to this
review,"earlier, I said 70%,"
5487.03,but estimates are as high as
75%,of people who try to quit
5490.18,smoking relapse within the first week.
5492.76,"The first week, they"
just,go right back to it.
5494.29,That's how powerfully
reinforcing,the nicotine is.
5496.81,"Remember, it's the nicotine"
in,the cigarette that's
5498.88,"powerfully reinforcing, but"
it's,"also the oral habit,"
5504.01,the motor habit.
5505.36,There is this thing about density
5506.83,of sensory receptors in the lips.
5508.24,"People like bringing things to their lips,"
5511.48,"food, cigarettes, other lips"
in,"some cases, et cetera,"
5516.61,there is a reinforcement
pathway,related to that
5519.01,for sort of obvious adaptive reasons.
5521.47,"And as a consequence,"
there,"is a reinforcement,"
5525.49,both from the behavior
and,from the dopamine
5527.59,released from the nicotine itself.
5529.18,"And as I mentioned earlier,"
5530.56,from the positive reinforcement
5532.72,that comes from increased focus.
5533.95,So the money that you make through work
5535.3,or your attentional ability
5536.68,or the fact that you're alert
and,"people feel you present,"
5538.63,all of that funnels back
into,"positive reinforcement,"
5541.9,"behavioral reinforcement,"
5543.79,and then what we would call addiction.
5546.28,So this review covers all of
that,and then steps beautifully
5550.24,through nicotine replacement
therapy,"and various compounds,"
5553.84,several of which I'm
going,"to talk about now,"
5555.76,which have been shown to increase
that,number that we talked
5558.43,about earlier of only 5%
of,people who try to quit
5561.49,with no other support
pharmacologic,or hypnosis
5564.43,"or otherwise just say that's it,"
I'm,"not going to smoke again,"
5567.07,"or I'm not going to vape again,"
5568.69,only 5% of people succeed in doing that.
5570.94,"And even among those, many"
end,"up relapsing later,"
5573.79,there are a couple
pharmacologic,approaches.
5575.89,One of the main ones that's
received,a lot of attention in
5577.93,"recent years is Bupropion,"
5580.12,sometimes referred to by its
commercial,name Wellbutrin.
5584.11,Now Bupropion is a compound
that,increases the release of
5589.27,dopamine and to a lesser
extent,epinephrine
5591.94,and some other neurochemicals as well.
5593.62,It's used for the treatment of depression
5595.66,and for smoking cessation.
5597.73,Now I want to point out
"again,","I'm not a psychiatrist,"
5599.98,so I'm not telling you to take
"Bupropion,","AKA Wellbutrin,"
5603.49,but I'm going to give you a little
bit,of the contour of what's
5605.5,typically done in terms of
Bupropion,administration
5608.5,to help people get relief
from,some of the withdrawal
5611.41,symptoms of trying to
quit,smoking or vaping
5613.93,or other forms of nicotine ingestion.
5616.57,Typically Bupropion is taken
in,300 milligram per day
5621.01,doses divided into two dosages
of,"150 milligrams each,"
5624.19,or sometimes there's a
slow,release formula.
5627.25,The dosages will vary
from,person to person.
5629.95,I want to really emphasize that there
5631.98,is an increased seizure
risk,with Bupropion.
5634.69,It only occurs in a small
fraction,"of the population,"
5636.97,but nonetheless is a real concern
5638.98,for those members of the population.
5640.42,"So for those of you with seizure risk,"
5642.22,"whether you know it or not,"
5643.66,that's going to be a valid concern
5646.18,in terms of potential side effects.
5648.01,The other thing about Bupropion
is,that it has to be used
5651.76,with caution in patients that
have,liver disease or renal
5654.16,disease that can impact the amount
5656.62,that anyone can take meaning
sometimes,people have to take
5658.72,a much lower dose if
they,have renal disease
5660.79,or liver disease.
5662.23,And sometimes they can't take it at all.
5663.94,Sometimes if people are taking
benzodiazepines,for whatever
5666.67,"reason or other sedatives,"
5668.994,there are contraindications
"there,",so Bupropion isn't a
5672.169,kind of one size fits all or magic bullet
5674.38,"for quitting smoking, nonetheless,"
5676.42,"for people that can take it safely,"
5678.07,"and again, this is a prescription drug,"
5679.9,a board certified psychiatrist
or,other physician is going
5682.51,to have to prescribe it for you
if,it's appropriate for you.
5684.64,And it moves that number of
5%,success rate to about what
5688.24,one sees with the clinical
hypnosis,to about 20% of people
5693.37,"will successfully overcome their nicotine,"
5696.79,or I should say their
smoking,or vaping addiction.
5700.3,Now it's important to ask
why,"this would work, right?"
5703.54,It's not as if Bupropion is
increasing,nicotine per se.
5708.25,What it's doing is it's tapping
5709.6,on that mesolimbic reward
"pathway,","increasing dopamine,"
5712.33,or at least allowing dopamine
levels,to say substantially
5715.18,elevated enough that people
don't,experience some of the
5718.99,drop in dopamine that leads
to,"the withdrawal symptoms,"
5721.42,"the lessening of mood, et cetera."
5722.86,And it's no coincidence that Bupropion
5724.66,is also an antidepressant.
5726.43,It's a common antidepressant
for,people that experience
5728.95,negative side effects
with,"the so-called SSRIs,"
5731.29,the selective serotonin
reuptake,inhibitors that prevent
5734.5,them from taking those
things,like lessen libido
5736.51,"or appetite,"
5737.343,or in some cases increased
appetite,or any number
5739.9,of other side effects
that,"some people, not all,"
5742.06,but some people experience with SSRIs.
5743.83,"They'll be prescribed Wellbutrin,"
5745.27,Bupropion is the generic name.
5748.18,So Wellbutrin being the
commercial,"name again,"
5750.19,Bupropion is what they'll be
prescribed,instead with the
5754.51,"caveats of seizure risk, renal disease,"
5757.6,"liver disease, et cetera."
5759.76,The outcomes with Wellbutrin
for,smoking cessation
5762.46,are pretty good if you
think,about an increase
5764.02,"from 5% to 20%, that's pretty dramatic."
5767.11,And yet I also want to refer
back,to the incredible success
5770.38,of the clinical hypnosis approach.
5772.12,"Again, you can find that at reveri.com,"
5774.73,the clinical hypnosis approach
has,a success rate of 23%.
5780.126,"So it's very closely aligned with,"
5780.959,if not exceeding the
success,rate with Bupropion.
5784.42,Of course there are other
pharmacologic,approaches
5786.58,to quitting smoking or vaping.
5789.61,All of them generally circle
back,to increasing dopamine
5793.06,and/or norepinephrine in order to offset
5795.25,some of the withdrawal
symptoms,of smoking cessation
5798.46,or vaping cessation.
5799.72,A very common approach for
people,to try and quit smoking or
5802.9,vaping is to use nicotine
itself,to try and prevent people
5808.45,from seeking nicotine through
a,cigarette or a vape pen.
5812.29,What I mean by that is people
using,a nicotine patch or
5815.44,nicotine gum or other
nicotine,delivery device
5819.07,that is not cigarettes and not vaping
5822.01,in order to maintain levels of nicotine
5825.25,"in their bloodstream,"
5827.11,which of course means maintain
levels,of nicotine in their
5829.51,brain and body to the same extent
5832.18,that they would if they
were,"smoking or vaping,"
5835.03,maybe even gradually taking
down,the total amount of
5838.57,nicotine in their brain
and,body by reducing
5841.63,the number or size of nicotine gum pieces
5844.96,"that they ingest each day,"
5846.43,or keeping the patch on for
a,shorter amount of time
5849.04,or getting a lower dose patch
that,releases less nicotine
5851.77,total or over time.
5855.49,All of those approaches have been shown
5857.23,"to be reasonably successful,"
5859.12,"I'll get to the numbers in a few minutes,"
5860.23,but reasonably successful
in,allowing people
5863.35,to quit smoking or vaping.
5866.75,"Again, most of the data"
is,on cigarette smoking
5869.77,because vaping is a
relatively,new phenomenon.
5872.23,"Although quite troublingly,"
5874.48,"it's a very rapidly increasing behavior,"
5877.81,especially in the young population.
5879.34,So that's why I'm kind of
lumping,these two things together
5881.47,because I think very soon we
are,going to need an all out
5886.21,campaign for how to
counter,vaping addiction.
5889.6,So what do we know about smoking cessation
5891.94,using nicotine itself?
5893.56,Is the patch best? Is nicotine gum best?
5896.53,Turns out that a combination of approaches
5899.68,"is best, so somewhat surprising,"
5901.66,but it was very clear from the
literature,that I was able to
5903.49,find that using nicotine
patches,for some period of time
5907.39,and then switching to a gum
5909.25,and then perhaps switching
to,"a nasal spray,"
5913.15,that's going to be the most effective.
5914.98,Then the question is how long
to,continue each of those
5918.13,and whether or not to overlap them.
5919.6,It seems as if doing one for
about,a week and then switching
5922.6,to another for about a week and
then,switching to another is
5925.33,one rationable and reasonable approach
5927.82,that many people have used successfully.
5930.19,Why would that be?
5931.09,It all has to do with the
different,rates of absorption
5933.88,"of nicotine into the bloodstream,"
5935.53,and then the downstream consequences
5937.15,"of that on the dopamine,"
"acetylcholine,","epinephrine,"
5940.48,and other systems of the brain and body.
5942.64,And while there hasn't been
an,extremely detailed study
5945.97,of the exact kinetics of
5947.86,how the nasal sprays versus
the,transdermal patches
5950.26,"versus the gums, et cetera, work,"
5952.09,there's a logical structure to it
5953.56,that will immediately make sense to you.
5954.88,"First of all,"
5956.323,the transdermal patches
provide,a fairly steady state
5958.93,dopamine release across the day.
5961.45,And oftentimes people are
wearing,them at night as well.
5963.79,This is relevant because if
people,are ingesting nicotine
5966.85,"by way of smoking and vaping,"
5970.36,hopefully they're not waking
up,in the middle of the night
5971.95,just to smoke or vape.
5972.91,"Believe or not, some people do that,"
5974.2,"but of course, while people are asleep,"
5976.39,they are not smoking or vaping.
5978.55,They always tell you don't fall asleep
5979.48,"with a cigarette in your mouth,"
5980.313,"you'll burn the whole house down,"
5982.33,but exceedingly rare to have people
5985.51,are smoking in their sleep.
5987.04,So people wake up in the morning
and,because the half life
5990.1,of nicotine from smoking
or,"vaping is very short,"
5992.11,"anywhere from one to two hours,"
5994.03,they're essentially in a state
of,withdrawal at the point
5995.98,where they wake up in the morning.
5997.03,How can I say that?
5997.9,"Remember, withdrawal sets in"
about,four hours after the last
6001.32,ingestion of nicotine by cigarette
6003.21,or by inhalation from the vape pen.
6005.1,So people are waking up in
nicotine,withdrawal and then
6008.1,immediately going into the
behavior,"of ingesting nicotine,"
6010.95,or very soon after waking for most people.
6013.62,So nicotine patch is going to be
6015.66,"very effective for a week or so, again,"
6017.91,talk to your physician about
the,"best approach for this,"
6020.52,but then switching to a nasal spray
6023.94,or switching to nicotine
gum,"for about a week,"
6026.16,which is going to change the
kinetics,of that nicotine
6028.53,absorption into the bloodstream
and,change the release
6031.59,of dopamine and other
neurochemicals,within the brain.
6033.81,That's going to keep the system
intentionally,off balance
6037.23,so that it never comes to
expect,one single pattern
6040.89,or amplitude of dopamine release.
6044.04,"And that is a very powerful way for a,"
6048.57,let's just call it a
quitting,method to work.
6051.75,"Because as I've always said,"
6053.37,the most powerful schedule of dopamine
6056.28,is going to be this random
intermittent,reward.
6059.19,This is what's used in the casinos
6060.9,in order to take your money.
6062.1,"And generally they do, on average,"
6063.78,they take your money more
than,"you take theirs,"
6066.36,and they take more of it.
6068.1,Not just more often because
6069.66,they use this random
intermittent,schedule.
6071.85,The random intermittent schedule
is,one in which you don't
6074.19,really know when the peaks in
dopamine,are going to arrive.
6077.34,And so there isn't this
expectation,and craving.
6079.83,And then all of a sudden
when,"dopamine is released,"
6081.51,it's extremely high.
6082.41,That's how they get you
to,"continue playing,"
6083.79,even though basically you're losing money
6085.38,"and your dopamine is dropping,"
6086.37,they elevate it every once in a while.
6089.25,Nicotine replacement can
be,"used in a similar way,"
6091.77,"but in a benevolent way,"
6092.91,in order to help you get
over,smoking or vaping
6096.3,by keeping the total
amounts,of dopamine variable
6099.09,around the clock
6100.74,and by changing the amount
of,"dopamine that's released,"
6103.59,it seems to help people
behaviorally,and psychologically
6107.01,because they don't come to
expect,having a particular amount
6109.41,of dopamine in their brain
and,blood at any given time.
6111.78,And this is an important point
6113.7,because it brings us to
this,notion of homeostasis.
6116.85,Homeostasis is this tendency
for,biological systems
6119.52,to try and reach equilibrium.
6121.14,"What goes up, goes down, et cetera."
6122.61,And to some extent to the same degree.
6124.532,So I'll talk about this right now
6125.85,"in the context of nicotine use withdrawal,"
6129.9,and then the period in which people
6132.3,no longer crave nicotine.
6134.55,So you can imagine that
6136.29,"if we were to measure your heart rate,"
6137.76,"your blood pressure, and your"
overall,levels of alertness
6140.04,"and wellbeing and mood, let's"
just,give that some value.
6143.1,Let's say it runs from zero
to,"10, again, arbitrary units."
6145.8,Let's just take all those
physiological,measures
6148.02,and the subjected measure of your mood.
6149.397,And let's measure it
6151.53,four times an hour across the
"day,",across the waking hours.
6155.01,What we would find is a
line,that would kind of
6156.96,"squiggle a bit,"
6157.793,maybe a nice text comes
in,"that you really like,"
6159.9,maybe you get not so good
news,and your kind of
6162.93,"autonomic arousal is all over the place,"
6165.36,but on average is kind of a squiggly line
6167.55,where it increases in the morning
6168.84,because that's typically
when,body temperature
6170.76,and autonomic arousal increase.
6172.2,"And then towards the afternoon,"
6173.28,it's going to come sloping down.
6174.3,"And then right before sleep,"
6175.14,"there'll be an increase again,"
6176.34,if you've ever felt that you
kind,of run around a lot before
6178.11,"sleep and then it goes down,"
6179.31,that's kind of the typical contour
of,"autonomic arousal, mood,"
6183.57,"et cetera, across the day,"
6185.76,removing of course life events
and,things like psychiatric
6189.66,illness and depression and et cetera.
6192.18,That's the typical arc of that.
6193.95,Now let's superimpose on whatever
6195.81,"that contour is for you, nicotine."
6198.84,"So you get a little bolus as we say,"
6201.78,a little bit of nicotine
from,smoking a cigarette
6203.97,or from taking an
inhalation,"on a vape pen,"
6205.68,what ends up happening is there's
6206.69,"an increase in blood pressure,"
increase,"in heart rate,"
6208.83,"increase in mood, increase in alertness,"
6210.39,all the things we talked about earlier.
6213.48,"Over time,"
6215.28,the body starts to adjust so
that,the baseline upon which
6220.83,that nicotine induced increase
in,arousal would occur
6225.36,"is actually reduced, right?"
6227.79,Why would that be?
6228.623,"Well, the body and the brain,"
6231.18,your physiology seeks homeostasis.
6233.07,So if there's a big
increase,in all those things
6236.07,"like blood pressure and mood, et cetera,"
6237.96,typically your baseline
will,drop a little bit
6240.75,"to compensate for that over time,"
6242.22,after a couple days or even
weeks,of ingesting nicotine.
6245.07,"So let's say you wake up,"
6246.18,you're typically take an
inhalation,"off your vape,"
6248.88,or you have a cigarette around
6250.26,nine or 10:00 AM and you do that daily.
6253.32,You get used to a certain
level,of mood and alertness
6255.75,and wellbeing for that time of day.
6257.46,And then if you smoke
again,"in the afternoon,"
6259.14,let's say you also get accustomed
to,a certain level of mood
6262.35,and alertness and wellbeing
for,that time of day.
6265.08,"Again, it'll vary"
depending,"on life events,"
6266.85,but your system sort of gets
used,to it and your baseline
6269.16,will drop to compensate for those peaks
6271.02,so that the peaks aren't
quite,as high as they were
6273.21,when you first started using nicotine.
6275.34,Now you decide to quit.
6276.48,So now what we're talking
about,is transitioning from the
6279.57,consumption to what we're going
to,call the withdrawal phase.
6282.27,"So now what happens is you say,"
6284.19,"that's it, I'm going cold turkey."
6286.14,"I know there's only a 5% success rate,"
6287.82,but I'm going to just go cold
turkey,"or somebody will say,"
6290.61,"no, I'm going to use the Reveri app."
6292.02,"Or somebody says, no,"
6293.76,I'm going to use Bupropion or
another,method or nicotine patch
6296.97,or something of that sort.
6298.26,Setting aside the nicotine patch
6299.7,or the nicotine delivery device
6301.53,and only focusing on
approaches,for getting through
6304.92,withdrawal that have no
direct,effects on nicotine.
6309.3,"So not using the nicotine patch,"
6310.65,"but say the hypnosis or Bupropion,"
6314.16,"which can increase dopamine,"
6315.6,but it doesn't increase nicotine directly.
6318.42,What happens?
6319.47,"The day that you quit,"
6322.2,that homeostatic mechanism
in,your brain and body
6325.14,that sets your level of
mood,"and arousal, et cetera,"
6327.93,does not know and hasn't
adjusted,to the fact
6330.96,that you're not bringing in nicotine.
6332.4,You're not having that cigarette.
6333.45,You're not having that
inhalation,on the vape pen.
6335.88,So what ends up happening
is,"that baseline,"
6338.13,which has been adjusted
down,to offset the increases
6341.61,"in mood and alertness, et cetera,"
6343.71,when you smoke or vape is lower
than,it normally would be.
6348.3,So that 9:00 AM cigarette
time,or vape inhalation time
6352.95,"no longer feels above baseline,"
6355.47,it actually feels below baseline
because,what you're seeing
6358.38,is the lower amplitude
of,arousal that was there
6363.69,to offset the increase you were getting
6365.94,from vaping or smoking.
6367.32,"And then in the afternoon,"
6368.37,if normally you have a kind
of,phase of your afternoon
6370.53,"you really enjoy, you go outside,"
6371.76,"you have a vape or a cigarette,"
6373.5,you normally are feeling
relaxed,or you go out at night
6375.706,"and you like to vape and you say, nope,"
6376.56,"I'm not going to do that anymore,"
6378.06,"you're going to feel much,"
6379.35,much worse than you would've
had,you never started
6382.44,smoking or vaping.
6383.43,Now that's not much help to anyone
6385.434,who's already started smoking or vaping.
6387.81,But I say this because it's
very,important to understand
6390.9,that the reason why relapse rates
6392.55,"are so high within the first week,"
6394.02,75% of people relapse within
one,week and overall failure
6397.98,rates are 95% is because
people,don't expect
6401.34,to feel even worse than they did prior
6404.34,to ever smoking or vaping.
6406.08,So that first week is absolutely critical.
6408.78,And the beauty of understanding this
6410.25,is that if you can get
through,"that first week,"
6412.62,either by sheer grit or
by,finding other methods
6415.89,"to increase dopamine,"
healthy,"methods I would hope,"
6418.83,"and certainly cold showers,"
6420.54,ice baths have been shown
to,do that by the way.
6423.237,And this was described in
Dr.,"Anna Lembke's book,"
6425.377,"""Dopamine Nation"", cold"
showers,"can increase dopamine,"
6428.94,"exercise, positive social interactions."
6431.4,It's very likely that
people,will need to use
6433.83,other healthy methods to offset
that,reduction in dopamine
6437.19,if ever they stand to get
through,that first week.
6439.83,"And again, if you can get"
through,"that first week,"
6442.38,chances are quite a bit
higher,that you'll be able to
6445.05,maintain the cessation
of,smoking or vaping.
6449.13,"And of course, hypnosis,"
things,"like Bupropion,"
6452.04,"can also assist in that,"
6453.3,Bupropion by way of increasing
dopamine,"pharmacologically,"
6456.27,hypnosis through changes
in,neural circuitry
6459.12,"that aren't completely understood,"
6460.38,but seem to involve a remapping
of,some of the so-called
6463.8,default networks and some of
the,networks that are involved
6466.41,in kind of understanding
of,your own internal state.
6468.93,This stuff gets a little bit
complicated,and we're going to
6470.34,return to this in a upcoming episode
6472.98,"of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
6474.18,but there are indeed legitimate
changes,in neural circuitry
6477.78,caused by clinical hypnosis
that,can at least partially
6480.78,explain why it is so
effective,in helping treat
6484.38,or allow people to stop
smoking,and vaping.
6487.05,So for those of you out there
6489.232,"that, either here or"
are,"saying yourselves,"
6491.79,I just can't seem to
quit,smoking or vaping
6495.24,"or dipping or snuffing,"
6497.31,hopefully an understanding of
how,that homeostasis process
6500.94,"works and the time course of nicotine,"
6503.49,"depending on the delivery device,"
6505.2,hopefully understanding that
6506.73,will allow you to develop a protocol.
6509.91,Maybe it involves hypnosis.
6510.99,Maybe it involves just
understanding,that the typical times
6513.87,in which you ingested nicotine
through,any of the different
6517.92,approaches of bringing it into your system
6520.05,are going to be particularly hard.
6521.34,But I don't just mean particularly hard.
6523.2,"I mean, particularly hard,"
6524.033,and you're going to need to do
something,specific to offset
6527.22,that decrease in overall autonomic arousal
6530.58,"and dopamine, et cetera."
6532.2,Hopefully an understanding
of,that will allow you
6533.94,to get through that first week.
6535.05,And if you can make it
past,"that first week,"
6536.91,you stand a very good
chance,of never going back.
6539.73,"However, I did consult"
with,Dr. David Spiegel
6542.43,"in anticipation of this episode,"
6544.38,regardless of the method
that,you used to quit smoking
6548.52,"or vaping, snuffing, or dipping,"
6552.15,there's good evidence that
a,routine maybe once a month
6556.62,or even once a week hypnosis
type,approach to replenish
6561.99,or even enhance the neural
circuits,that are allowing you to
6564.66,stay away from nicotine is
going,to be a very good idea.
6567.18,And given that it's a purely
behavioral,"intervention,"
6571.44,I can see no reason as to
why,people wouldn't want
6573.69,"to do that, go in and reinforce, you know,"
6575.01,tighten the bolts on that
circuitry,that are allowing you to
6578.25,"not feel the impulse to smoke,"
not,feel the impulse to vape.
6581.58,"And just a very brief mention,"
6583.86,there is a vast literature on
the,fact that when people have
6587.58,quit smoking or vaping or other
form,"of consuming nicotine,"
6591.42,"that when they consume alcohol,"
6592.74,there's a much higher
probability,of relapse.
6593.98,There are interactions
between,alcohol and nicotine
6596.22,that we'll cover in future episodes.
6597.87,"But for those of you that want to quit,"
6599.43,"I want to assure you,"
6600.78,"despite the fact that 95% of people fail,"
6603.45,"with the appropriate tools,"
6605.04,and I like to think within an
additional,understanding of
6607.8,the underlying biology and
psychology,and what you can
6610.11,expect and when to really
dig,your heels and when to
6612.27,reinforce your system with more dopamine
6614.13,through any of the number
of,the different protocols
6616.2,and tools that we've offered here
6617.64,and that you can find elsewhere
6618.72,in other episodes of the
Huberman,"Lab Podcast,"
6621.21,I have a high degree of confidence
that,you can quit smoking
6625.43,"or vaping, dipping or snuffing."
6627.69,"So today, typical of frankly"
6629.31,"all episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,"
6630.9,we've covered a lot about the biology
6633.124,of a particular system.
6634.74,We talked about the biology
of,"nicotine in particular,"
6638.04,we talked about vaping and
"smoking,",dipping and snuffing
6642.18,and the negative health
consequences,associated with those.
6645.832,I want to reemphasize that nicotine
6647.76,is not what causes cancer.
6648.87,It is the delivery
device,that causes cancer
6651.45,and the other negative health effects.
6653.49,That is not to say that people
should,be ingesting nicotine
6656.49,through any different methods
6657.39,simply to get a cognitive boost.
6658.89,There are certain
circumstances,where that might
6660.72,be appropriate for the
occasional,"work about,"
6663.48,"certainly not for physical exercise,"
6666.03,"given what we talked about earlier,"
6667.65,but of course there are
more,and more approaches
6669.9,"to increasing, not just nicotine,"
6672.09,but acetylcholine generally
in,order to achieve
6674.58,cognitive enhancement
or,"physical enhancement,"
6676.56,or I should say physical
performance,enhancement.
6679.35,"Some of those we talked about earlier,"
6680.49,such as Alpha GPC.
6682.05,"In any event, nicotine,"
6684.72,"it should now be clear, is an"
immensely,powerful substance.
6687.84,One of the most commonly
ingested,substances
6690.0,on the face of the earth and
has,been for a very long time.
6692.82,And now that you understand
the,underlying biology and the
6695.34,way in which this changes your
psychology,"and physiology,"
6698.16,that should come as no surprise.

tremendous,benefit from them
6738.54,for things like enhancing
"sleep,","hormone function,"
