0.3 - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
1.9 where we discuss science
and science-based tools
4.89 for everyday life.
6.719 [upbeat rock music]
9.24 I'm Andrew Huberman,
10.23 and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
13.05 at Stanford School of Medicine.
14.97 Today we are going to be
discussing bipolar disorder,
17.61 often called bipolar depression.
20.13 Bipolar depression is a condition
22.41 in which people undergo massive shifts
24.87 in their energy, their
perception, and their mood.
28.32 However, it is very important to note
29.94 that these shifts in mood,
energy, and perception
32.61 are all maladaptive.
34.35 They can often cause tremendous damage
36.21 to the person suffering
from bipolar disorder
39.03 and tremendous damage to
the people in their lives.
42.27 Today we are going to parse the biology
44.61 that leads to these shifts in
mood, energy, and perception.
48.18 And we are going to talk
49.56 about the various treatments that exist.
51.57 Some of those treatments have been around
52.83 for a very long time,
54.24 and indeed one of those
treatments, lithium,
56.52 has an incredible backstory
about its discovery
60.39 and in understanding how lithium works
62.97 and some of the ways in
which it does not work well,
65.82 it reveals a tremendous amount
67.32 about how the brain works
normally in all individuals.
70.5 So that's a miraculous
story that I look forward
72.45 to sharing with you.
73.92 As we go forward in this
discussion about bipolar disorder,
77.01 I want everyone to keep in mind
78.06 that it is a very severe condition.
80.37 In fact, people suffering
from bipolar disorder
82.74 are at 20 to 30 times
greater risk of suicide.
86.7 So today is a serious discussion
88.86 and it's certainly one in which people
90.72 who are suffering from
manic bipolar disorder
92.79 or who know people that are suffering
94.2 from manic bipolar
disorder can benefit from.
97.17 However, for those of you
that might know people
99.54 or who themselves suffer
from major depression,
103.02 we will also be talking about important
104.67 treatment developments
for major depression.
106.86 Major depression is a very
common thing for many people.
110.34 In fact, most people will
suffer from depression
113.16 of some sort at some point in their life,
115.56 although not necessarily a
major depressive episode,
118.14 and yet major depression is very common.
120.99 So you'll soon learn up to 20% of people
122.88 will suffer from major depression.
124.92 So today's discussion will
encompass all of that.
126.957 And it will also encompass
basic brain mechanisms
130.23 of neuroplasticity, the
brain's ability to change
132.75 in response to experience
both for good and for worse.
136.32 And you'll learn a lot
about the basic biology
139.5 of how the brain regulates
mood, energy, and perception.
143.28 I'm pleased to announce that
the Huberman Lab Podcast
145.14 is now partnered with
Momentous Supplements.
147.45 We often talk about supplements
on the Huberman Lab Podcast
149.94 and while supplements aren't
necessary for everybody,
152.16 many people derive
tremendous benefit from them
154.29 for things like enhancing
the quality and speed
157.11 with which you get into sleep,
158.64 or for enhancing focus
or for hormone support.
161.67 The reason we partnered
with Momentous Supplements
163.47 is several fold.
164.303 First of all, their supplements
165.3 are of the absolute highest quality.
167.04 Second of all, they ship internationally
169.32 which is important because
many of our podcast listeners
171.81 reside outside the US.
173.43 Third, many of the supplements
that Momentous makes
176.25 and most all of the supplements
177.81 that we partnered with them directly on
179.64 are single ingredient formulations.
181.77 This is important for a number of reasons.
183.27 First of all, if you're going to create
184.59 a supplement protocol that's
customized for your needs,
187.35 you want to be able to figure
out which supplement ingredients
189.72 are most essential and only use those
191.7 and supplements that
combine lots of ingredients
193.74 simply won't allow you to do that.
195.27 If you'd like to see the supplements
196.44 that we partnered with Momentous on,
198.18 you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,
201.15 and there you'll see
many of the supplements
203.28 that we've talked repeatedly about
204.72 on the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.
206.97 I should mention that the
catalog of supplements
209.43 that are available at
livemomentous.com/Huberman
212.1 is constantly being expanded
213.84 So you can check back there,
livemomentous.com/huberman
217.2 to see what's currently available.
218.97 And from time to time, you'll notice
220.59 new supplements being
added to the inventory.
222.78 Before we dive into the discussion
224.1 about manic bipolar disorder,
225.27 I want to highlight some recent findings
226.89 in an area totally
separate from mental health
229.77 that I think are really
important for everyone
231.27 to know about.
232.17 This is a paper published
in the journal Cell,
234.18 which is a Cell Press
Journal, an excellent journal.
236.28 In fact, one of the three apex journals.
238.11 So for those of you that are curious,
239.67 papers published in the journal
Nature, Science and Cell
242.76 are considered the sort of Super Bowl,
245.52 Stanley Cup, and NBA
championships of publishing.
248.4 And this paper entitled,
250.5 an inter-organ neural circuit
252.27 for appetite suppression illustrates
254.01 a very important principle
that I think everyone
256.02 should know about,
256.92 and that's the principle of
so-called parallel pathways.
260.43 Parallel pathways, as the name suggests,
262.86 are pathways, they
could be neural pathways
264.9 or hormonal pathways or otherwise
267.9 that operate independently of one another
270.39 to accomplish a common goal.
273.0 And what this paper really shows
274.74 is that there's a set
of peptides in the body
278.61 and the peptide that
I'm referring to today
280.65 is called GLP-1, Glucagon-like peptide-1,
284.34 and some related peptides.
285.72 I've talked about these
on the podcast before
287.94 for two reasons.
288.773 First of all, I'm a big
proponent and consumer
292.47 of yerba mate.
294.119 Yerba mate is a tea that
can promote the release
296.64 of glucagon-like peptide-1.
298.98 And there are also new prescription drugs
301.62 that are now hitting the market.
302.94 And for which there are really
impressive clinical trials
305.04 for diabetes and obesity
306.93 that are essentially glucagon-like
peptide-1 stimulator,
311.16 so they stimulate the release of that,
312.45 or they are in fact, a synthetic version
315.27 of glucagon-like peptide-1.
316.92 what is glucagon-like peptide-1?
319.11 It is a peptide, which is
a small little protein,
321.96 that can dramatically suppress appetite.
325.11 So that's why these
drugs are being explored
327.45 and are showing quite impressive results
330.3 for things like treatment
of type 2 diabetes
333.18 and other forms of diabetes,
as well as obesity.
336.45 So they lead to weight loss.
338.01 Now in terms of the yerba mate stimulation
339.96 of glucagon-like peptide-1,
341.28 that's going to be a much lower amount
343.17 of glucagon-like peptide-1 that's released
345.06 from drinking yerba
mate as opposed to say,
347.76 taking a drug that stimulates GLP-1
350.1 or taking a drug that is GLP-1.
352.53 Nonetheless, should also point out
355.26 that yerba mate comes in a
bunch of different forms.
358.59 There is some concern about
certain smokey-flavored forms
363.03 of yerba mate being carcinogenic,
365.28 so that's why I avoid
those forms of yerba mate.
367.8 But for me, yerba mate is one
369.0 of the preferred sources of caffeine.
370.95 For me, I like the way it tastes.
372.48 It does provide that sort of caffeine kick
374.43 that I like to have early in the day
375.66 for focus and for work and for exercise.
378.21 And yet I actively avoid
the smoked varieties
380.94 of yerba mate because of the potential
382.92 carcinogenic effects of
the smoked varieties.
386.28 Glucagon-like peptide-1,
as I mentioned earlier,
388.98 can suppress appetite.
390.75 But what this paper shows is it does that
393.93 by at least two mechanisms
through parallel pathways.
397.68 What this paper shows is
that glucagon-like peptide-1
401.31 axon receptors in the body in a portion
403.92 of the nervous system called
the enteric nervous system,
406.53 E-N-T-E-R-I-C, enteric nervous system.
409.95 This is a component of your nervous system
411.24 that you don't really have control over,
412.83 it's autonomic or automatic.
415.23 GLP-1 binds to what are called
417.3 intestinofugal enteric neurons,
419.82 you don't need to know the name,
420.99 but those neurons do two things.
422.7 First of all, they cause
some gut distension,
426.24 so they actually make you feel full.
428.37 This is incredible, right?
429.48 A peptide, not actual physical food,
431.88 but a peptide that stimulates neurons
435.24 that cause changes in the
so-called mechanoreceptors
438.38 of the gut, of the enteric nervous system
440.97 and make people feel full.
442.59 So it can lead to actually mild,
444.54 or I suppose if levels
of GLP-1 are very high,
447.09 to major gut distension.
449.37 I think that the levels
of GLP-1 that would come
451.35 from drinking yerba mate
452.43 and hopefully from appropriate dosaging of
455.61 the synthetic forms of GLP-1
or drugs that stimulate
458.4 GLP-1 would cause mild,
not major, gut distension,
460.86 'cause major gut distension
would be uncomfortable.
463.68 So GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut
466.05 to increase gut distension,
468.36 and by way of a pathway
that goes from the gut
471.66 up to the hypothalamus, this
little cluster of neurons
474.18 about the size of a marble that sits above
476.07 the roof of your mouth, is
also suppressing appetite
478.98 through brain mechanisms.
480.57 So this is really beautiful, right?
481.98 You have a peptide, a small little protein
484.11 that's released in the gut
486.06 and that release within the
gut causes gut distension,
490.5 which makes you feel full.
491.7 And by way of neural
stimulation of the hypothalamus
494.79 also activates neural
pathways within the brain
497.31 that trigger satiety, the feeling
of having had enough food.
500.67 So to me, GLP-1 is both
impressive and important.
503.76 Why?
504.593 Because this recent category of drugs
506.76 that's now hitting the market
508.5 seems to adjust obesity or can
help people with weight loss
512.04 in order to help their health.
513.78 And it's doing so by at
least two mechanisms.
516.39 One is within the brain, and
the other is within the gut
519.45 and communication through the
so-called gut brain access.
522.63 Because again, these enteric neurons
524.37 are communicating to the
brain, the hypothalamus,
527.37 by way of this, what's called
529.284 the
sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic
pathway,
532.59 you absolutely do not
need to know all of that.
534.69 That's a mouthful,
535.523 that's enough to make
your mouth feel distended.
537.51 But at the same time,
things like yerba mate,
540.45 and I'm sure there are other
compounds out there as well,
542.31 but certainly yerba mate can
stimulate the release of GLP-1.
545.4 So for those of you that are looking
546.51 for some mild appetite suppression
548.34 and want to accomplish that
while also ingesting caffeine,
551.4 yerba mate might be a
good option for that.
553.38 And just know that it's
operating through two mechanisms,
556.23 on the body through mild gut distension
558.03 to make you feel full,
558.9 and on the brain to increase satiety
560.73 and make you feel less hungry.
562.23 And then for everybody, not just those
564.39 that are interested in
appetite suppression,
566.43 I think it's important to understand
568.44 that these parallel
pathways are fundamental
570.66 to how we are organized.
572.13 Another good example of this would be
573.48 when we are excited by
something positive or negative,
576.0 so it could be stressful or
we are positively aroused,
578.52 there is a parallel activation
of epinephrine, adrenaline,
581.85 both from your adrenals and
from an area in the brain
584.04 called the locus coeruleus.
585.48 So again and again, we see this in biology
587.427 and in neuroscience that
your brain and your body
590.37 are acting in concert.
592.11 They're acting together through mechanisms
594.42 that either are independent,
so separately in the brain
596.85 and separately in the body,
598.14 but directed towards a common goal,
600.66 or through communication
between brain and body,
603.15 and almost always that communication
605.31 is going to be bidirectional,
606.63 body to brain and brain to body.
608.58 So I think these results
are really interesting
610.41 and really important
for sake of weight loss,
612.45 for sake of appetite suppression,
614.49 and just generally for the
way that they illustrate
616.77 this very important theme
618.42 of the way that we are constructed
620.22 at a biological level
which is parallel pathways.
623.19 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
624.99 that this podcast is
separate from my teaching
626.91 and research roles at Stanford.
628.53 It is however part of my desire and effort
630.6 to bring zero cost to consumer information
632.49 about science and science-related tools
634.44 to the general public.
635.76 In keeping with that
theme, I'd like to thank
637.5 the sponsors of today's podcast.
639.6 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
642.06 InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform
644.46 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
646.98 to help you better understand your body
648.6 and help you reach your health goals.
650.61 I've long been a believer
651.72 in getting regular blood work done
653.34 for the simple reason
that many of the factors
655.62 that impact your immediate
and long-term health
657.75 can only be assessed with
a quality blood test.
660.12 And nowadays, with the
advent of modern DNA tests,
662.97 you can also get insight
into, for instance,
664.86 what your biological age is
666.45 and compare that to
your chronological age.
668.46 And of course your biological age
669.96 is the one that's important
for your longevity
672.03 and your understanding of
your current health needs.
674.34 One major problem with most blood tests
675.9 and DNA tests out there however,
677.94 is that you get information
back about levels
679.92 of metabolic factors, levels
of hormones and lipids
682.44 and so forth, but you don't know exactly
684.12 what to do with that information.
685.86 InsideTracker solves that problem
687.6 through their personalized platform
689.31 which can tell you, for instance,
690.78 lifestyle factors like
fitness or nutrition
694.2 or supplementation that you can use
695.97 to bring the numbers into the ranges
697.38 that are ideal for your health needs.

709.74 Today's episode is also
brought to us by ROKA.
712.14 ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
713.97 that are of the absolute highest quality.
715.77 The company was founded by
two all-American swimmers
717.72 from Stanford and everything about ROKA
719.58 eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed
721.59 with performance in mind.
723.09 I've spent a lifetime working
724.23 on the biology of the visual system
725.73 and I can tell you that your visual system
727.23 has to contend with a number
of very important challenges
729.81 in order for you to see clearly.
731.52 The designers of ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
733.5 understand this
734.7 and for that reason, ROKA
eyeglasses and sunglasses
737.1 allow you, for instance, to move
738.66 from a shady area to a bright area
740.22 or from a bright area to a shady area
741.9 and still see everything
with crystal clarity.
744.33 Originally, their glasses and sunglasses
745.92 were designed for performance,
747.51 that is for running and cycling,
749.01 and as a consequence, the
eyeglasses and sunglasses
751.38 stay on your face even if you get sweaty
752.88 and they're extremely lightweight.
754.14 In fact, most of the
time, I don't even realize
755.79 that they're on my face.
756.78 I wear ROKA eyeglasses for
reading and for driving at night
759.72 and I wear their sunglasses
when I'm out during the day
761.7 and it's really bright and
I need to use sunglasses
764.22 in order to be able to navigate
in that bright sunlight.
766.86 If you'd like to try ROKA
glasses, you can go to roka.com,
769.62 that's R-O-K-A.com, and
enter the code Huberman
772.44 to save 20% off your first order.
774.6 Again, that's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com
776.79 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
778.98 Today's episode is also
780.21 brought to us by Blinkist.
781.799 Blinkist is an app that has
thousands of nonfiction books
784.26 condensed town to just 15 minutes each
786.54 of key takeaways that you
can read or listen to.
789.39 I'm a big believer in
reading physical books,
791.46 I actually own a lot of hard cover books
793.38 and paperback books and I
like holding them my hand
795.93 and flipping through the pages.
797.19 I also like listening to audiobooks.
799.17 But the reality is I don't have
a ton of time to read books
802.29 and I don't have a lot of time
803.19 to listen to entire audiobooks.
805.08 There are also a lot of books
that I've really enjoyed
806.97 in the past that I have
read in their entirety
809.1 but then I like to update myself
810.39 on the information on
every once in a while.
812.61 Blinkist has terrific books available.
814.35 For instance, I'm a big fan
815.34 of Tim Ferris's 4-Hour Body,
817.47 gleaned So much knowledge from that book.
819.3 Also from Nassim Taleb's
book, The Black Swan
822.06 and the great Matt Walker's
book, Why We Sleep,
824.85 which is a book that
I've read several times
826.32 and I actually listen to the synopsis of
828.54 on Blinkist over and over
830.25 because there's so many key takeaways.
832.17 With Blinkist you get unlimited access
833.88 to read or listen to a massive library
835.71 of condensed non-fiction books,
837.72 essentially all of the books
838.74 that you ever wanted to listen to,
840.42 and now you have time
841.47 because they're condensed
down to just 15 minutes each.
843.75 Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
845.31 just for Huberman Lab Podcast listeners.
847.23 If you go to blinkist.com/huberman,
849.69 you can get a free seven-day trial
851.67 and you can get 20% off a
Blinkist premium membership.
854.88 That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
858.12 blinkist.com/huberman to get 25% off
861.39 and a seven-day free trial.
863.37 Let's talk about bipolar disorder.
865.11 And today I'm going to
refer to bipolar disorder
867.21 interchangeably with bipolar depression,
870.33 although as you will soon learn,
872.31 not everyone with bipolar disorder
874.35 necessarily goes through highs and lows.
877.53 There is a subset of people who suffer
879.54 from bipolar disorder who
experience the manic phases,
882.84 the highly elevated mood and energy,
885.93 and then drop down to so-called baseline,
888.6 so they don't necessarily go
down into a depressive state.
891.75 They often will return to
a somewhat normal state.
894.42 In fact, we will talk about
the percentage of time
897.63 that people with bipolar disorder
899.31 tend to be symptom-free manic or depressed
902.82 in the context of the different categories
904.44 of bipolar disorder.
905.7 But as we wade into this topic
that is bipolar disorder,
909.12 I just want to give you a little bit
910.05 of the background statistics
911.85 to anchor us in just how
serious and prevalent
914.88 bipolar disorder is.
916.86 So bipolar disorder
impacts about 1% of people,
920.25 that might seem like a small percentage,
922.56 but if you think about a
room of a hundred people,
925.23 that means that at least one of them
927.09 is very likely to have bipolar disorder.
930.69 And as I mentioned earlier
in the introduction,
932.88 bipolar disorder is very serious.
935.25 It has a 20 to 30% greater
incidence of suicide
939.72 than the general population, which is,
942.09 first of all, extremely tragic
943.74 and extremely concerning.
945.54 So anyone that thinks they
might have bipolar disorder
948.54 or who knows someone with bipolar disorder
950.25 should be especially vigilant about this.
952.11 And we'll talk about some of the,
953.97 or signs and risk factors, age of onset,
956.58 et cetera, as we move forward.
958.74 So 1% of people have bipolar disorder.
961.11 The typical age of onset
is anywhere from 20
964.17 to 25 years old, although
it can be much earlier.
967.59 And the earlier the onset
of a bipolar episode,
971.43 which we will define in a few minutes,
973.14 the earlier the onset of that episode,
975.66 the higher likelihood
that the bipolar disorder
978.45 is going to be a stable feature
980.25 of that person's psychology going forward.
982.95 And yet, I also want to point out
984.75 that there are some very good treatments
987.12 for bipolar disorder that those people
988.56 could still benefit from.
990.66 There are basically two
kinds of bipolar disorder
993.93 referred to as bipolar 1 and bipolar 2.
996.96 So let's just talk about bipolar 1 first.
999.75 Bipolar 1 is characterized by
1002.45 a fairly extended period of mania.
1005.09 What is mania?
1006.2 Mania is a period of very elevated mood,
1009.47 energy, distractibility, impulsivity,
1012.32 and some other symptomology
that we'll talk about
1014.57 going forward.
1015.62 But this manic episode is extreme.
1019.64 This is a condition in
which the energy lift,
1023.51 the mood lift, and the sort of impulsivity
1026.6 and actions and words of the person
1028.73 suffering from manic bipolar disorder
1030.65 are very noticeable and very extreme.
1033.8 Now a key thing, however,
1035.15 is that it's not always noticeable
1036.95 to the person suffering from it
1038.9 that they are in this mode.
1040.43 Sometimes they recognize
that, sometimes they don't,
1042.74 but it's always highly
recognizable to other people
1045.92 that the person suffering
from manic bipolar disorder
1049.22 is not like other people.
1050.96 So let's talk about bipolar
1 in a little bit more depth.
1054.47 One of the key clinical criteria
1056.69 or diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1
1059.09 is that a person suffer
from these manic episodes
1062.66 or display these manic episodes
1064.7 for seven days or more.
1066.59 That turns out to be very key.
1067.7 The stability of that manic episode
1069.98 for seven days or more turns
out to be very important.
1073.88 And for those seven days,
1075.89 the person is in an elevated mood,
1077.84 expansive thought all day,
every day for those seven days.
1082.4 Now there are a lot of reasons
1083.51 why somebody could be in a manic mode.
1086.24 It doesn't necessarily mean
1087.68 that somebody has bipolar disorder.
1089.72 In fact, someone could be in a manic mode
1091.82 for seven days or more
1093.62 and still not be diagnosed
with bipolar disorder.
1095.9 Why?
1096.733 Well, there are other things
that can create manic episodes,
1100.64 things like traumatic brain
injury, things like seizure,
1103.82 things like various prescription
drugs or illicit drugs,
1106.4 things like amphetamine and cocaine,
1108.56 that is not the same as bipolar disorder
1110.81 even though from a
symptomology perspective,
1114.05 they might look even identical.
1116.06 So let's think about these symptoms
1117.32 and the diagnostic criteria
that a psychiatrist would use
1120.98 in order to ask whether
or not someone is manic
1124.01 because they have manic
by bipolar disorder
1126.47 or whether or not that person is manic
1128.42 for some other reason, such
as traumatic brain injury,
1131.39 illicit drugs, et cetera.
1133.52 So typically a person would
be brought into a clinic
1137.81 or a person would bring
themselves to a clinic
1140.66 or meet with a psychiatrist,
1142.49 it seems more likely that
they would be directed
1144.53 toward a psychiatrist because oftentimes
1146.24 people who are in a manic episode
1148.13 just simply won't have the perspective
1150.32 or the foresight to bring
themselves into the clinic.
1153.5 And the psychiatrist is
going to start to evaluate
1156.2 for a couple of different things.
1157.79 But first of all, what they're
going to try and figure out
1160.25 is whether or not the
person has at least three
1162.71 of the following symptoms.
1165.83 The first symptom is distractibility.
1168.29 Is the person distractable?
1169.43 Are they going from one thing to the next.
1170.93 People who are in a manic episode
1172.28 will be talking about a pen
1173.24 and then they'll be talking
about something they saw
1175.16 the other day and then
something they want to purchase
1176.69 and then a place they're
going to travel to, et cetera,
1178.7 but they are also very
prone to any stimulus
1181.79 within the room.
1182.623 Meaning a bell could go off
1184.31 or there could be a
sound out in the hallway
1185.48 and they'll orient to that.
1186.47 And then they'll orient to the clinician
1187.79 and then they'll orient to
something in their pocket,
1189.47 so they're all over the place.
1190.79 You could think of this
a little bit like ADHD
1193.28 or attention-deficit disorder,
but it's very extreme.
1196.34 So highly distractable,
1197.84 highly impulsive, impulsivity
relates to actions.
1201.65 So the person might be
fidgeting with something
1203.63 and then they might try and leave the room
1205.22 or the person might, if they
were out in the real world,
1208.959 somebody might notice that the person
1210.83 is going and purchasing
1213.17 multiples of something that
would be unusual for someone
1216.02 to purchase.
1216.853 So for instance, I happen to know someone
1218.6 whose ex-spouse had bipolar disorder
1221.06 and their ex-spouse went out and bought
1224.03 10 plus air fryers.
1225.523 I mean, I think unless you're a restaurant
1227.66 that's using a lot of air fryers,
1228.83 the idea that you would need more than one
1230.48 or two air fryers might
just seem a little bit
1233.75 out of the norm.
1234.86 And so that impulsivity can be purchasing,
1237.98 it can be other things as well.
1239.96 It can be booking 12 international
trips in one afternoon
1243.35 or going and buying three cars, et cetera.
1245.48 So impulsivity.
1246.62 the other is grandiosity.
1248.63 People who have manic bipolar disorder
1251.27 who are in a manic
episode will often display
1254.72 words of or actions of grandiosity.
1257.15 And keep in mind, these are not lies
1259.7 in the sense that the person isn't lying
1261.53 in order to try and pull
one over on anybody,
1264.11 these are actual beliefs
that the person comes to have
1266.96 about their grandiose
position in the world
1269.81 or grandiose opportunities
or potential in the world.
1273.2 Typical forms of grandiosity
and manic episodes
1276.11 would be that the person suddenly decides
1278.09 that they are going to
win a Pulitzer Prize.
1280.07 They are the person selected
to win a Pulitzer Prize.
1282.17 They're going to write
a novel that afternoon,
1284.18 and they're going to win a
Pulitzer Prize that year,
1286.31 which is more or less
a delusion of grandeur.
1289.46 The idea that someone could
do that in one afternoon,
1291.35 I suppose it is possible in
the realm of all possibilities,
1295.22 but it's extremely unlikely.
1297.71 Other forms of grandiosity
that often present themselves
1301.1 in people suffering from a manic episode
1303.44 will be that they're
going to run for president
1305.45 or that they are the
person that they believe
1309.26 is selected by the
citizens of a given country
1313.49 or by the universe to be the
president of that country
1317.0 or to be present of the universe.
1318.77 It sounds ridiculous, but
those sorts of delusions
1321.35 of grandiosity are one condition
1323.18 that often presents itself,
1324.71 or one set of symptoms
that presents itself.
1327.74 Flight of ideas are also
typical of manic episodes.
1331.13 So this is a little bit
like distractibility,
1333.02 but this would be people
talking extensively
1335.36 about one thing and then switching
1336.92 and talking extensively
about something else.
1338.66 It would be as if I was doing this podcast
1340.46 talking about manic bipolar disorder
1341.78 and then suddenly switching to OCD
1343.67 and then to deliberate cold exposure
1345.2 and then to the role of sugar
1347.06 and its impact on the brain, et cetera.
1348.47 So essentially a random selection
1351.56 of the different topics
that exist in science,
1354.8 all of which I happen
to be very interested in
1356.51 and curious about,
1357.59 but just as we have
episodes of the podcast
1360.92 that are about one or two topics,
1362.57 and we focus on those in
a fairly narrow trench
1365.09 of discussion,
1366.26 somebody who has a flight of ideas
1368.45 would be jumping between
categories and topics
1371.96 in a kind of pseudo random way.
1373.58 So they might take off
down a path of one thing
1375.71 and then switch to another
without any transition
1378.32 or with transitions that that don't have
1379.97 any logical structure to them.
1381.98 The other aspect of manic bipolar disorder
1385.07 that often presents itself
in the manic episodes
1387.17 are agitation.
1388.07 People feeling extremely
physically agitated,
1390.05 so a lot of shaking and moving about.
1392.24 This can venture into
the realm of paranoia,
1394.58 but a lot of agitation,
1396.14 a difficulty sitting down and being still,
1399.23 a difficulty in just looking,
feeling and acting calm.
1404.93 And then another condition is no sleep.
1408.02 And when I say no sleep, I mean no sleep
1410.84 or very minimal sleep.
1412.97 As incredible as it sounds,
1415.22 people who are in a manic episode
1416.93 can often go seven days
or more with zero sleep.
1420.89 And a key feature of this zero sleep
1423.02 is that they're not troubled by it.
1424.25 They're not thinking, oh,
I'm suffering from insomnia
1426.5 and I really, really want to sleep.
1427.73 Sometimes that's the case,
but more often than not,
1430.34 they are simply not sleeping.
1431.93 They're staying up 24 hours
then another 24 hours,
1434.62 it just continues for an entire week.
1436.94 Again, inconceivable to those of us
1439.01 that don't suffer from manic episodes.
1441.847 I can only imagine how pulled
apart most of us would feel
1444.95 under those conditions,
and yet they are just going
1447.68 and going and going with no sleep,
1449.63 up all hours, shopping, talking, running,
1454.7 doing all sorts of different
things in the categories
1456.95 of other symptoms that
we talked about before.
1459.17 And it doesn't bother them
that they're not sleeping.
1462.23 And then the last sort
of category of symptoms
1465.62 that the psychiatrist is evaluating for
1467.81 and seeing if they present
is rapid pressured speech.
1471.56 The rapid pressured speech is something
1473.45 that when you hear it, you recognize it.
1475.22 This is somebody that almost
seems to be hitting you
1477.11 with speech like machine gun fire,
1479.66 it's coming at you, coming
at you, coming at you
1481.61 and there's really no
room for conversation.
1483.83 They're not offering any opportunity
1485.87 for a back and forth, or if
there is a back and forth,
1487.82 they might ask you how
you feel about something
1489.17 and then you started, well, I,
1490.239 [speaking gibberish]
1491.229 then they're going to hit
you with another barrage
1492.86 or a paragraph of information
1495.68 or of just speech, that pseudo random.
1498.08 So we've got distractibility, impulsivity,
1500.3 grandiosity, flight of ideas, agitation,
1502.94 no sleep, and rapid pressured speech.
1506.24 For someone to be diagnosed
as in a manic episode,
1509.12 they do not have to be engaging in
1511.97 or displaying all of those symptoms.
1515.3 They do however need to present
1517.64 at least three of those symptoms,
1519.59 and then in order to meet
the condition of bipolar 1,
1523.07 they have to be presenting
those three symptoms
1525.26 for at least seven days.
1527.78 It could be longer, but
at least seven days.
1530.9 Now, this seems pretty
straightforward, right?
1534.2 At one level, the way that I describe this
1536.417 and the way that it exists
in the clinical literature,
1538.46 you could think, well,
1539.39 this should be pretty easy to diagnose.
1541.31 And yet there's a complication there
1542.89 or a challenge there because
the psychiatrist, again,
1545.63 has to determine that these manic episodes
1548.21 are not due to something
other than bipolar disorder.
1553.46 For instance, again, it could be TBI,
1555.44 traumatic brain injury,
it could be seizures,
1557.18 or meds or other sorts of drugs.
1558.92 Corticosteroids, which
are often prescribed
1560.87 for a number of immune
conditions or for wound healing
1563.63 can also cause manic episodes.
1565.76 So they have to determine that everything
1568.34 that's happening meets the
criteria I described before,
1570.95 three out of seven of
these symptom categories
1573.02 for seven days or more
1574.4 and that it can't be better explained
1576.56 by something else going
on in that person's life
1579.2 or immediate medical history.
1581.33 That's very important.
1582.5 Now, the other challenge,
1583.58 and this is something
that's going to come up
1584.87 again and again today, not
just in the description
1587.24 of the biology of bipolar disorder,
1589.28 but also the description
of different treatments
1592.19 and treatment approaches,
1593.57 is that typically, when
somebody is sitting
1596.99 in front of a psychiatrist,
1599.21 in particular for the first time
1601.76 those two people are interacting,
1604.01 the psychiatrist is just
getting one snapshot
1606.89 of the person at that moment.
1608.99 So the person could be on
day one of a manic episode,
1612.17 the person might be on day
six of a manic episode,
1614.69 the person could be transitioning
out of a manic episode,
1617.66 or the person could be
suffering from a combination
1620.57 of manic episode where,
1622.34 because of the impulsivity
of bipolar disorder,
1624.62 they went out and used illicit drugs.
1626.03 They also used cocaine.
1627.68 So the psychiatrist has
a serious challenge.
1630.86 The psychiatrist has to determine
based on a conversation,
1634.1 this isn't a blood test,
1635.87 this isn't a measurement
that you can take on a scale
1638.27 or with a biomarker, they
have to use language,
1641.12 a conversation with somebody
who, by all accounts,
1643.7 is pretty impaired at conversation
1645.71 to determine whether or not
1647.33 they're suffering from a manic episode
1649.85 that is the consequence
of bipolar disorder.
1653.36 You can imagine this in the real world,
1654.83 as somebody says, well,
how long has it been
1656.69 since you slept?
1657.523 And the person starts to answer,
1659.36 oh, well, the other day I
went down to the basement.
1661.85 I was going to get something out of
1662.99 the refrigerator and I
thought I might take a nap.
1664.85 And then all of a sudden they're talking
1665.683 about something completely different.
1666.71 So they might not even have an answer.
1668.87 So the psychiatrist has to
be a really good detective,
1673.01 a benevolent detective,
1674.09 but a detective nonetheless
1676.04 in determining whether or not
1677.15 these symptoms have existed
for seven days or more,
1679.19 and whether or not they
meet the, at least three,
1681.53 it could be more, but at least three
1682.64 of the criteria of symptom categories
1684.86 I talked about before.
1686.27 Now, assuming that they do,
1688.22 assuming that the patient
meets those criteria,
1690.74 they are likely to be
diagnosed with bipolar 1.
1694.1 Now bipolar 1 disorder
1696.89 means they're having these
extended manic episodes,
1698.66 seven days or more,
1699.83 but it does not necessarily mean
1701.99 that they are dropping into
a depressive episode as well.
1705.83 This is a common misconception
about bipolar disorder
1708.77 because as it's often called,
1710.72 bipolar disorder is referred
to as bipolar depression,
1714.26 and yet many people with bipolar disorder
1716.84 don't necessarily experience
the deep depressive episodes.
1719.99 Many of them do, but many of them do not.
1722.48 So somebody can truly
be diagnosed accurately
1726.23 with bipolar one,
1728.27 even though they're only
experiencing manic episodes
1730.61 and then dropping down to baseline.
1732.2 Manic episode, then
dropping down to baseline.
1734.33 That's very important to understand.
1736.85 Now, the second category of
bipolar disorder is bipolar 2.
1740.63 So BP-II or bipolar disorder
2 is somewhat different
1744.35 than bipolar disorder 1.
1745.55 First of all, it's
characterized most often
1748.58 by the presence of both
manic episodes, mania,
1751.79 and depressive episodes,
1753.29 or what's referred to as hypomania.
1755.84 Now, anytime in biology or
in medicine you hear hypo,
1759.95 it's the opposite of hyper.
1761.99 So we've got normal hyper and hypo.
1764.18 Hypomania is a somewhat
suppressed level of mania.
1767.72 So this is not going to be as extreme
1769.64 as the mania that we typically think of.
1771.98 And yet the hypo can
be due to the duration,
1776.09 not the intensity of mania.
1778.37 That's right.
1779.203 Hypomania can mean a
lessened intensity of mania,
1782.99 but it can also be used to refer to
1785.33 a shorter duration of mania.
1786.767 And in fact, that's
one of the key criteria
1789.29 for bipolar 2.
1790.43 Bipolar 2 is often diagnosed
1792.17 on the basis of the
presence of manic episodes
1794.9 that are lasting four days or even less.
1798.71 So someone with BP-II might have four days
1801.08 of this increased energy,
goal-directed activity,
1803.63 they're irritable, they're euphoric,
1805.07 they're not sleeping, et cetera,
1806.63 but it's only lasting for about four days.
1809.12 Or they could be having longer
extended periods of mania,
1812.51 but they are hypomanic episodes.
1815.24 They're not quite as intense
1816.56 so the pressured speech
isn't quite as pressured.
1819.47 The impulsivity isn't quite as severe,
1821.69 et cetera, et cetera.
1822.77 The other aspect of bipolar 2
1824.06 is one that I had mentioned
briefly a moment ago,
1826.49 which is that it's often associated
1828.98 with the drops into
the depressive episode.
1831.44 So people are going from manic episodes
1833.54 for four days or less,
1834.86 then they're dropping into a depression,
1836.99 going back to normal, manic again.
1840.77 I do want to point out however
1841.85 that people who have
bipolar 1 can indeed go
1844.61 from manic episodes to severe,
1846.53 what we call major depression,
1847.73 so they can oscillate like a sine wave,
1850.04 really high highs, really low lows.
1853.07 And very important to understand
1855.86 in terms of understanding
both bipolar 1 and bipolar 2
1859.7 is that it's not always a sine wave.
1861.71 This is really important
1862.67 and it's something that
frankly I did not know
1865.22 until I started researching this episode
1866.81 and talking to some psychiatrists.
1868.4 I should mention, I've talked to several
1869.72 board certified
psychiatrists in preparation
1871.64 for this episode,
1872.81 I'll give some references to them.
1874.28 And in fact, some of them
are going to be coming
1875.66 on the podcast as guests in the future
1877.52 for more in-depth discussion about bipolar
1879.41 and other psychiatric disorders.
1881.63 But all the psychiatrists
I spoke to confirmed
1884.81 what the other was saying, which was that
1887.3 the way that bipolar disorder can present
1889.34 can vary tremendously between individuals.
1892.04 One person might go from very high highs
1894.14 that last seven days or more,
1895.13 to very low lows.
1896.15 Bouts of depression, major depression
1898.283 that can last two weeks or more.
1900.62 Other people are rapid cycling by way
1902.99 of three days manic, three days normal,
1905.06 three days manic, and then dropping
1906.56 into three days depression.
1908.03 So you want to erase
that picture in your mind
1910.49 that manic bipolar
disorder is this sine wave,
1913.49 this cycling up and down
between mania and depression.
1916.46 It can take a lot of different forms.
1918.92 And again, this is a serious challenge
1922.16 for the psychiatrist to
diagnose people because of that
1925.88 fact that they're only getting a snapshot
1927.8 of the person unless they've
known them for some time
1929.81 and are working with them for some time.
1931.67 But this is also especially important
1933.83 for those of you that
1935.45 either have bipolar depression
or suspect that you might,
1938.99 or that know someone
with bipolar depression
1942.65 or suspect somebody might
have bipolar depression,
1946.13 AKA bipolar disorder.
1947.9 Because if you're noticing that somebody
1949.94 is very manic and then normal, well,
1953.03 that's a very different picture
1954.23 than somebody who's going from very manic
1956.06 to very deep bouts of depression.
1958.55 The very manic to deep bouts of depression
1960.77 is easier to recognize
because of the extremes
1963.71 of those highs and lows.
1964.76 Now, this might seem somewhat obvious
1966.32 to all of you as I describe it,
1967.91 and yet it's very important as a, frankly,
1971.12 a citizen of the planet
1972.65 who knows other human beings
1974.27 to keep an eye out for
these manic episodes,
1976.34 because again, whether or
not it's four days or less,
1979.01 or whether or not it's seven days or more,
1981.44 these manic episodes really
are the defining criteria
1985.04 of bipolar disorder,
AKA bipolar depression.
1988.01 There are a couple other key features
1990.62 about bipolar 1 and bipolar 2
1992.75 that can allow us to get better insight
1994.55 into whether or not somebody
has bipolar 1 or bipolar 2,
1997.28 and that's the percentage of time
1999.44 that people with bipolar
1 versus bipolar 2 spend
2003.1 in a manic state, a depressed state,
2004.99 or a symptom-free state.
2006.64 And this is also important to discuss
2008.08 because it turns out that people
2010.18 with genuine diagnosed bipolar 1
2013.18 or bipolar 2 are often symptom-free,
2016.45 which again can make it difficult
2018.64 for us as people that know them
2020.77 or for people that are treating people
2023.41 with bipolar disorder to
identify whether or not
2026.71 somebody is in a manic episode
2028.72 or a depressive episode,
2029.553 or whether or not they
are headed into a manic
2031.57 or depressive episode.
2032.95 So the numbers on this have been studied.
2035.68 This from a paper, actually two papers,
2037.69 first author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al.
2040.12 published some years ago, 20 years ago,
2042.1 but the data hold up
really nicely over time.
2044.35 These were both published
2045.28 in Journal American Medical
Association Psychiatry.
2047.86 So JAMA Psychiatry is a superb journal.
2050.35 And basically people who
have bipolar 1 on average
2053.92 spend about 50%, it's
actually 53% was the number
2058.18 that was eventually converged upon,
2060.43 but about 50% of their time symptom-free.
2062.86 That's interesting, right?
2063.76 Somebody who has genuine
bipolar 1 disorder
2067.15 can spend as much as half of their life
2069.22 symptom-free, sleeping normally,
2070.75 speaking normally, et cetera.
2072.4 About 32% of the time depressed,
2076.48 And when we say depressed,
we mean major depression.
2078.52 So severe challenges with waking up
2081.43 at two or three in the morning,
2083.02 and having trouble falling back asleep.
2084.55 That's one of the defining
characteristics of depression,
2086.53 or sleeping far too much,
2087.76 having a hard time getting
out of bed in the morning,
2089.29 suppressed appetite, suppressed libido,
2091.0 suppressed motivation,
2092.65 all the general symptoms
of major depression
2094.45 which we'll talk about
a little bit more later
2096.19 and in an upcoming episode
about major depression
2098.95 in particular.
2099.783 And then about 15% of their time
2101.92 in this kind of manic
state or mixed manic state,
2104.83 where they are showing
2107.2 long, again, seven days or more bouts
2109.12 of sleeplessness, irritability,
2110.68 pressured speech, grandiosity, et cetera.
2113.98 Contrast that with people
who have bipolar 2 disorder
2116.74 who are spending about half of their time
2119.98 in a depressed state.
2121.78 So that's interesting, people
with bipolar 2 disorder,
2124.45 while not always
displaying depressed states
2127.33 or oscillations between mania or hypomania
2129.97 and depressed states,
2131.14 they tend to be in the
depressed state more often.
2133.66 And again, this is major depression.
2134.98 This isn't just a little bit of a low,
2136.45 this is a serious depression
of their nervous system,
2139.3 their mood, and as we say, their affect,
2141.7 their outlook on life,
2142.84 and that's one of the key
distinguishing features
2145.21 of major depression is that
people's outlook on life
2148.57 becomes very diminished in the sense
2150.91 that they don't see a future.
2152.14 You ask them about, how's work going?
2154.57 How're your relationships?
2155.403 And it's not just that they
feel that that's going poorly,
2158.29 they really feel as if
there's no opportunity
2160.24 for those things to improve.
2162.64 Those people with bipolar 2
2164.77 tend to be symptom-free
about 45% of the time.
2167.53 Again, these are averages,
2169.36 so about 45% of the time,
2171.37 that's a considerable amount of the time.
2173.35 And they tend to be in
these hypomanic states
2175.81 only about 4 or 5% of the time.
2178.24 Again, the criteria for BP-II, bipolar 2
2180.76 is these four days or less
2182.32 of mania or hypomania,
2184.33 but only 4% of the time or 5% of the time
2187.42 is a small enough sliver of the pie
2190.75 that is these people's existence
2192.79 that you could imagine why it would be
2195.43 easy for them or other people
2197.68 to overlook the fact that
they have bipolar disorder
2200.59 and not major depression.
2201.61 Think about it.
2202.443 This is a person who, or I should say
2204.64 a collection of people who are spending
2205.9 about half of their time depressed,
2208.24 close to half, 45% of
their time symptom-free,
2212.47 and then about 5% of their
time in a hypomanic state.
2216.13 So either shorten bouts of
2218.86 high intensity mania or hypomania
2222.43 that is of reduced intensity.
2224.5 One of the reasons that I
mentioned these percentages
2227.02 of time spent in a
symptom-free, depressed manic
2229.3 or hypomanic state is
because one of my major goals
2231.34 for today's episode is that
it will increase awareness
2234.82 of whether or not you
or somebody you know,
2237.82 could be a coworker, could
be family member, et cetera,
2239.95 might be suffering from
bipolar 1 or bipolar 2.
2242.68 I think it's fair to say
that if somebody is suffering
2244.57 from bipolar 1,
2246.25 that is likely to be revealed
2249.19 or to reveal itself
2251.32 before too long, because of the fact
2253.42 that people have these
extended periods of mania
2255.307 and mania is such an extreme state,
2257.35 not just for the person
who's experiencing it,
2259.48 but the way that it
presents is just so extreme
2261.7 and out of the ordinary.
2263.53 But bipolar 2, you can imagine
2265.57 could really duck under the radar
2267.61 of our awareness.
2268.87 And you could imagine
that we might just think
2270.82 somebody is low or depressed,
2272.23 especially if that person
tends to self-medicate
2274.51 with alcohol or other substances.
2276.46 We might think, oh, they're
drinking more than often
2278.5 more than usual, excuse me,
2279.79 or they're spending more
time alone and isolating.
2282.58 But then when they're in
their hypomanic state,
2284.2 that might actually
present as normal to us
2286.69 because they were in such
a depressed state before.
2289.39 So it's very important that
we dial up our awareness,
2291.94 that we have tune our
antennae to the possibility
2294.25 that people out there who
might appear depressed
2296.35 or that we haven't heard from in a while
2297.88 might actually be suffering
from bipolar 2 disorder.
2300.58 Before we move into a in-depth discussion
2302.98 about the different kinds of treatments
2304.33 for bipolar disorder,
2305.92 I'd like to touch on just
a few additional aspects
2308.62 of what bipolar disorder can do
2311.05 in terms of its negative consequences.
2312.73 And also talk about some
of the inherited risk
2315.31 that is the genetic factors
2317.23 and the environmental
factors that can contribute
2319.3 to bipolar disorder.
2320.62 In terms of the burden,
2323.29 the very real, emotional, and occupational
2326.47 and educational burden that can occur
2328.57 for somebody with bipolar disorder,
2330.67 that's actually been studied.
2331.72 There's a measure of this,
it's called global burden
2333.94 which is defined as the years lost
2336.82 in engaging a normal life
due to some disability.
2340.33 So that disability could be cancer
2342.22 or that disability, in this
case, is bipolar disorder.
2345.07 And basically the way
this sort of study is done
2347.89 is that through questionnaires,
2349.21 I should say quite
in-depth questionnaires,
2351.61 there's a probing for whether
or not somebody has lost
2355.36 two consecutive weeks or more
2357.61 of interest in normal activities.
2359.5 Now, for people who have depression,
2361.06 that's a kind of straightforward
thing to address, right?
2363.55 You ask somebody, when
was the last time you ate,
2365.89 or when was the last time
that you went a few days
2367.75 without food or lost interest
2369.34 in relationships or work or
sex or things of that sort
2372.91 and they answer and you can figure out
2374.89 the amount of time that you've essentially
2376.99 been withdrawn from normal
levels of activity for them.
2381.73 With bipolar disorder, What it turns out
2384.25 is that the global burden
of having bipolar 1
2387.76 and even bipolar 2 is massive.
2390.13 In fact, having bipolar disorder
2392.74 sits as one of the highest risk factors
2396.07 for being in the top 10
2398.68 of all categories of disabilities
2400.93 leading to global burden.
2402.1 Put in plain English, what that means is
2403.78 having bipolar 1 or bipolar 2 disorder
2406.9 is extremely debilitating.
2408.52 It really slows down one's life trajectory
2412.27 unless it's treated properly.
2414.13 Now, the other aspect of bipolar disorder
2416.38 is its heritability.
2417.7 And this gets into a little
bit of some tricky science
2420.7 related to inheritability versus
2423.91 the genetic contribution
of a given disease.
2428.05 So that might sound like the same thing,
2430.03 you think, okay, genes
relate to heritability,
2432.34 heritability relates to genes,
2433.75 but of course, everything about the way
2436.57 that our nervous system
works and functions
2438.67 and expresses itself,
healthy or otherwise,
2441.37 is an interaction between our genes
2443.71 and our environment.
2445.06 And so typically the way
these studies are done
2447.13 is you address what is the risk
2449.62 of somebody having a given condition
2451.66 in the general population?
2452.74 We talked about that
before, bipolar disorder
2454.69 is a 1% of the world's population.
2457.15 Compare that to people who
have only major depression.
2460.03 So this would be repeated bouts
2462.07 of two weeks or more
of serious depression,
2464.95 not just low mood or
something due to a life loss,
2467.65 but major depression,
2469.84 which is 10 to 17% of people
have major depression.
2473.921 They suffer from major
depressive disorder,
2477.13 compared to bipolar disorder
which, again, is 1%.
2479.77 Now, you can address how much of the 1%
2484.122 of bipolar disorder that exists is due
2486.1 to genes versus environment
2488.44 in a somewhat exact way.
2490.21 This is never an exact science.
2491.74 And the way that this is typically done
2493.36 is to look at concordance,
2495.43 that is the likelihood
that two identical twins
2500.02 will both have a given condition
2502.39 as opposed to two fraternal twins,
2504.19 which have more different genes
2506.89 than identical twins, of course.
2508.21 And then two siblings who
have similar genes, of course,
2511.24 but less similar than
identical or fraternal twins
2514.42 and so on and so forth.
2515.5 So what you basically do
2516.55 is you evaluate the
probability that two people
2518.59 in the general population
who are completely unrelated
2521.32 will have the same
condition, versus two people
2523.939 in the general population
who are very related,
2526.6 identical twins.
2527.433 And what you find is
that in identical twins,
2530.92 if one identical twin
has true major depression
2534.79 or major depressive disorder,
2536.65 there's a 20 to 45% chance
2539.77 that their identical twin will also have
2542.05 major depressive disorder.
2543.67 Now that tells you right there
2545.41 that it can't all be genes,
2547.36 that is not a gene for
major depression per se,
2549.67 or if it is a gene or
a collection of genes,
2553.36 that those genes are also subject
2555.1 to environmental influences,
2556.48 either prenatal, within the womb
2557.89 or after children are born.
2560.14 Now the large range there of 20 to 45%
2562.51 could be due to any number of things.
2564.4 It could be experimental,
2566.11 meaning the techniques that
were used in experiments,
2568.03 it could be due to regional differences,
2571.54 one part of the world versus another.
2572.77 There are a lot of different factors.
2574.48 Right now, we probably
shouldn't delve into all that.
2576.76 At some point, we'll
probably do an episode
2578.17 all about the genetics of
nervous system heritability
2581.74 and heritability of features
and mental health, et cetera.
2584.59 But we can compare major
depression and the heritability
2587.98 or the genetic concordance
between identical twins
2590.77 in major depression and
bipolar disorder and ask,
2593.11 if one twin of an identical twin pair
2596.86 has bipolar depression,
2599.77 what is the likelihood that
the other twin will have it?
2602.38 And it turns out that
number is much higher.
2605.71 It's 40 to 70% likelihood or probability
2608.98 that if one twin has bipolar disorder,
2612.82 that their identical twin will
also have bipolar disorder.
2615.58 So again, the total
incidence of bipolar disorder
2619.23 in the general population is much lower
2622.51 than it is for major depressions,
2623.83 1% for bipolar versus 10 to
17% for major depression.
2628.12 But the genetic component is much higher,
2631.27 40 to 70% for bipolar disorder
2633.76 versus 20 to 45% for major depression.
2636.85 I know I'm throwing a
lot of numbers out there,
2640.24 but basically what this means
2641.95 is that researchers have been
able to take those numbers
2645.52 and filter them through a
number of different risk factors
2648.82 that are related to early development,
2650.89 ask questions like if two
twins were raised separately
2653.71 or together, or in one part
of the world versus another,
2656.35 or had a two parent household
versus one parent household,
2659.17 evaluate a lot of different variables,
2661.21 what they were able to discover,
2663.13 and this has been shown again and again,
2665.08 is that the genetic
contribution to bipolar disorder
2670.15 is very, very high.
2672.04 That is the heritability
of bipolar disorder is 85%.
2677.86 So again, I want to be
really clear what this means,
2681.73 the total occurrence in the
general population, fairly low,
2686.02 still serious, 1%,
2687.91 but fairly low compared to other things
2690.13 like major depression.
2691.12 However, if someone has bipolar disorder,
2695.11 it's very likely that they inherited
2697.69 some gene or sets of genes,
2699.49 or more accurately, a
susceptibility within their genes
2704.17 to environmental influences
2705.76 that can trigger bipolar disorder.
2708.25 There are a lot of
different ways to discuss
2710.41 and to conceptualize heritability
2712.33 so I want to be very careful with the way
2713.83 that I'm wording this.
2715.39 What this means is that
people with bipolar disorder
2718.54 very likely have a gene, or more typically
2721.54 it's going to be a set of genes
2723.07 that creates a susceptibility
for bipolar disorder
2725.68 to present itself.
2727.51 Now, what environmental factors trigger
2730.36 or increase that susceptibility
is not entirely clear.
2734.47 This always seems to center back
2735.76 onto the same sets of things like
2738.22 early life stress, trauma, et cetera,
2740.02 certainly those are going
to exacerbate the likelihood
2742.69 that someone who has a genetic propensity
2744.67 for bipolar disorder will express
2746.95 that bipolar disorder
2747.783 and its full array of symptomology,
2750.31 but 85%, while very,
very high, is not 100%.
2755.95 Again, 85%, while a very high number
2758.38 for heritability is not 100%.
2760.18 What that means is that
there is no single gene
2763.6 or identified gene cluster
for bipolar disorder.
2767.26 The reason I keep drilling
into this over and over
2769.27 is that I think we can confidently say
2771.28 that if someone has bipolar disorder,
2772.81 that there was something
in their genetic lineage
2775.15 that led to that, or that
very likely led to that,
2778.21 and yet it's not like eye color
2782.38 or some other physical feature,
2784.63 which we can actually do the direct,
2787.3 so it's called Mendelian genetics,
2788.71 and figure out whether or not somebody
2791.59 directly inherited that
gene from one parent
2793.66 or the other parent.
2794.493 So the takeaway here is that if you have
2797.92 certainly an identical
twin, or a fraternal twin,
2799.93 or a sibling or a parent,
2801.46 or even a cousin or an uncle
2802.72 that has bipolar disorder,
in particular bipolar 1,
2806.89 well, then you need to be on the lookout
2809.38 for bipolar disorder, perhaps in yourself
2811.84 and for the family members of that person.
2813.85 My goal within this episode up until now
2816.37 has been to provide a
clear and detailed picture
2819.7 of bipolar disorder and its various forms.
2823.03 Before we start to talk about treatments
2824.77 for bipolar disorder and some
of the neural circuit basis
2827.92 for bipolar disorder,
2829.48 I want to make sure that I
distinguish bipolar disorder
2832.18 from borderline personality disorder.
2835.24 We will do an entire episode
2836.74 or maybe even several episodes
2838.15 about borderline personality disorder.
2840.52 Borderline personality disorder
2842.53 can indeed present itself
2845.23 in ways that resemble bipolar
disorder and vice versa,
2849.49 but there's some key
distinctions that need to be made
2852.34 because it turns out that bipolar disorder
2854.47 and borderline personality disorder
2856.99 are quite distinct in terms
of their defining criteria.
2860.95 The key distinction between somebody
2862.84 with borderline personality disorder
2865.3 and bipolar disorder
2867.22 is that in borderline
personality disorder,
2870.34 there can be episodes that can
resemble mania or hypomania.
2874.36 So periods of flights of ideas,
2876.55 or where people are
spending money excessively
2879.07 or sexually promiscuous in ways
2881.41 that seem manic or could even be
2883.27 a little bit manic or a lot manic,
2885.67 and yet more often than not,
2888.28 there is an environmental trigger
2890.59 for those manic episodes.
2892.27 That is distinctly different
from bipolar disorder
2895.99 where the person will have manic episodes
2898.33 without any need for a trigger.
2900.34 There doesn't need to be a call
2902.38 from someone saying, hey, let's
go on a vacation together,
2905.29 or there's something coming up this Friday
2907.48 that's really exciting,
2908.77 or let's enter a relationship together
2911.17 of one form or another.
2912.4 The person with bipolar disorder
will have episodes of mania
2915.46 or episodes of major depression
2917.59 without any need for an external stimulus
2920.5 or environmental trigger.
2922.15 But the person with borderline
personality disorder,
2924.94 almost always, again,
2926.23 there's never an always
in biology and psychiatry,
2928.45 but almost always is going
to exhibit flights of mania
2933.04 or depressive episodes or
other types of mood shifts
2935.8 that are dramatic and maladaptive
2937.99 in response to things
that are coming in through
2941.11 the external environment or relationships
2943.06 of some kind.
2943.893 In fact, one of the
defining characteristics
2945.7 of borderline personality disorder
2947.86 is this thing that's
referred to as splitting.
2950.05 A good example of splitting in a person
2952.09 with borderline personality disorder
2954.1 is that they will feel that
they absolutely adore you
2957.85 and want to spend all their time with you
2959.65 and just think the world of you.
2961.06 You can do no wrong.
2962.23 And in fact, they
genuinely can feel that way
2965.38 and can genuinely think
that way about you.
2967.72 And then for whatever reason,
2970.0 it could be a perception of something
2972.19 that you did or something that you said
2974.26 or suspicion that you're
thinking something about them,
2977.11 they can suddenly shift
or split their emotions
2981.51 in what's called move
you from a good object
2985.03 or a can do no wrong
object to a bad object.
2988.24 They'll suddenly decide that
you are cheating on them
2990.76 or that you are being mean to them
2993.22 or that you're insulting them
2994.54 or that something that
you're doing is in violation
2998.08 to their self worth,
their wellbeing, et cetera
3000.66 and that can send them down a pathway
3002.55 of being very angry, very
depressed, et cetera.
3004.95 As I describe the contour of a person
3006.81 with borderline personality disorder
3008.79 as somebody who splits
very suddenly in response
3011.52 to some environmental
trigger, real or perceived,
3014.46 there's the risk, of course,
3016.17 that it makes the person with borderline
3017.97 personality disorder
sound like a bad person,
3020.34 that they're very volatile.
3022.08 And while they can be volatile,
3023.79 I want to be very careful to point out
3025.41 that the person with
borderline personality disorder
3027.66 is also suffering in this context.
3030.3 So while those sorts of relationships
3033.21 with people with borderline
personality disorder,
3035.79 whether or not they're
romantic relationships
3037.62 or familial or coworkers, et cetera,
3039.69 can be very challenged,
can be very high friction
3042.03 because of the good object,
bad object shifts, et cetera,
3046.47 it's bidirectional, meaning the person
3048.39 with borderline personality disorder,
3049.95 as you can imagine, is also going through
3051.6 a lot of suffering.
3052.433 At one moment, they feel
3053.58 as if someone is wonderful
and can do no wrong
3055.68 to them and they want to
be so strongly affiliated
3057.54 with them, and then in the next moment,
3059.25 they feel as if that
person is attacking them
3061.41 through their actions or even
through their non actions.
3064.05 So again, we will return
3065.64 to borderline personality disorder
3067.47 in a separate episode,
it's a serious disorder,
3069.96 both for the person that has it
3071.22 and for people around them.
3072.63 Fortunately, there are
some emerging treatments
3074.46 that are showing promise
3076.2 and it's a fairly common disorder,
3078.54 but it's important that we distinguish
3080.61 borderline personality
disorder from bipolar disorder,
3083.85 mostly on the basis of
this need for a trigger.
3085.98 Again, in bipolar
disorder, there is no need
3088.98 for a trigger to create a manic episode
3091.14 or a major depressive episode,
3092.49 they just happen or they can just happen.
3095.67 Whereas in borderline
personality disorder,
3098.34 almost always there's an external trigger
3100.56 or a perception that something happened
3102.6 in the environment or
that somebody is behaving
3105.24 a certain way that dramatically shifts
3107.13 the person with borderline
personality disorder
3109.62 from one mode to the next.
3111.48 As we move into our discussion
about the treatments for
3113.82 and neural circuits
underlying bipolar disorder,
3116.55 I want to just nail
down one more key point.
3119.97 This is a very brief point
3121.47 but it's perhaps the most
important point, which is
3125.37 the highs and lows, or
we should say the highs,
3129.15 these manic episodes, and sometimes lows,
3131.49 'cause again, not everybody
3132.54 with bipolar disorder 1 or 2
3134.13 suffers from depressive episodes,
3135.9 sometimes yes, sometimes no,
3137.64 in particular in bipolar 2, yes,
3139.83 but people with bipolar 1 can
have extreme manic episodes
3142.77 and then just return to
normal as you recall.
3145.05 Well, those extreme lows
and or extreme highs
3148.47 of people with bipolar disorder
3150.51 impact their lives in very negative ways.
3153.99 This is essential and it's something
3156.06 that we're going to return
to a little bit later
3157.65 when we talk about the relationship
3159.03 between bipolar disorder and creativity,
3161.61 because it turns out that there's a quite
3163.38 strong association there,
3165.48 one that would almost lead you to believe
3167.19 that being bipolar can be beneficial
3168.72 in certain contexts, and yet,
3171.36 on whole, having bipolar disorder
3174.21 is extremely detrimental and challenging
3176.88 to the person suffering from it.
3178.32 And it's something that
we want to keep in mind
3179.97 as we think about treatments
and the underlying biology.
3183.45 Now I'd like to talk about
some of the treatments
3185.25 for bipolar disorder.
3186.9 And in the discussion of those treatments,
3188.88 there's an absolutely incredible history
3191.82 of the discovery of one
particular treatment
3194.28 that still shows great
success in many patients,
3198.12 although some people
can't take it for reasons
3200.28 that we'll talk about.
3201.54 And in the description of the discovery
3203.94 of this treatment for bipolar disorder,
3206.28 it also reveals to us that sometimes
3209.07 treatments come to the
profession of medicine
3212.82 and through science in ways that precede
3216.63 the discovery of the underlying biology.
3219.51 That's right, every once in a while,
3221.61 someone will discover a
treatment for a disease
3224.4 without any understanding
3226.29 about the underlying biological basis
3228.63 of that disease.
3229.95 And in fact, that is the
case for bipolar disorder
3232.8 and the treatment that we are referring to
3234.84 is lithium.
3236.58 Lithium, as some of you know,
3239.04 is on the periodic table of elements.
3241.47 It is indeed a naturally
occurring substance.
3244.44 It actually arrived on
earth by way of star dust.
3248.25 Yes, we are talking about
star dust on this podcast,
3251.04 but if you'd like to learn more
about the origins of lithium
3253.53 and how lithium arrived here on earth
3255.81 for its discovery and
applications in psychiatry,
3258.96 there's a beautiful talk
that exists on YouTube
3261.66 and we'll provide a link to this
3262.74 in the show note captions that describes
3265.86 the history of lithium in terms
3267.93 of its interplanetary travels
3269.91 and arrival on earth.
3271.26 This is a talk delivered by a physicist
3274.14 who is expert in quantum mechanics
3276.39 and is expert in lithium.
3278.28 And it's a just wonderful
talk that I can refer you to,
3280.74 less on the biology in that talk,
3282.36 but certainly a lot about
lithium as an element.
3284.37 So for those of you nerds like me,
3286.83 that love to know how things
came to be here on the planet
3290.82 in one form or another,
3292.38 I'll encourage you to take
a brief listen to that talk.
3295.26 We are going to discuss
lithium in the context
3297.36 of its applications for
treatment of bipolar disorder.
3300.51 And the discovery of
lithium as a treatment
3302.34 for bipolar disorder is
truly a miraculous story
3305.94 that I think everyone should know.
3307.53 The key player in this
story is a physician
3311.4 by the last name Cade, he
was an Australian physician.
3314.88 And Cade has a very interesting
story in his own right.
3318.18 Cade was an Australian psychiatrist
3320.07 or Australian psychiatrist
3322.83 who also was a soldier.
3324.81 And during World War II,
3327.3 after the fall of Singapore to Japan,
3329.13 he became a prisoner of war
3331.35 and he was a prisoner of
war from 1942 until 1945.
3335.58 So he had some time for observation
3337.8 and during his imprisonment,
3339.48 he observed some of his fellow inmates
3341.73 is going through pretty wild vacillations
3344.58 in mood and energy,
3346.26 essentially going from manic episodes
3348.51 to depressed episodes, or
from manic to normal episodes.
3351.81 And for one reason or another,
3354.87 we don't know why because
I couldn't find any report
3357.09 as to why he hypothesized this,
3359.04 but he hypothesized that
there was some buildup
3361.62 of some chemical in these people's brains
3365.4 that then they would urinate out.
3367.98 And that urinating out
of whatever chemical
3371.7 was in there would allow
them to be more relaxed
3374.94 and not manic.
3375.773 In other words, Cade hypothesized
3377.88 that there's a buildup of a chemical
3379.26 in certain people's brains
that makes them manic
3381.24 and they urinate that chemical out.
3383.61 So eventually he got out of this prison,
3387.12 as we mentioned in 1945,
3389.04 and he started doing experiments
3390.96 in addition to seeing
patients in his clinic.
3393.87 And what he did is he
started to take urine
3396.06 from people who exhibited mania
3398.28 and urine from people who were not manic,
3400.98 and he took that urine
and he would inject it
3403.5 into guinea pigs as an experimental model.
3406.41 And his general observation was that
3409.74 there was something in the urine
3411.48 that was indeed making
the guinea pigs more manic
3415.17 if they were injected with
urine from a manic patient.
3419.67 The exact measures that he was
taking in these guinea pigs
3422.25 wasn't exactly clear.
3423.3 This is at a time or an era in science
3426.18 when you could just sort of report things
3428.28 a little bit more subjectively,
3429.72 although there were still
numbers and statistics,
3432.21 it was a little bit more
of like case studies
3434.55 and descriptions, but it turns out
3436.17 that even though that all
seems a little bit loose,
3438.27 it led to some incredible and
still important discoveries
3441.93 for psychiatric health.
3443.67 So what he figured out was that the urine
3446.22 from manic patients
seemed to be more toxic
3448.29 for these guinea pigs.
3449.85 And he also knew that there
are two toxic substances
3453.42 in urine, urea and uric acid.
3456.81 So he was able to separate
the urea and uric acid
3460.17 from people with mania
3461.88 and patients that did not have mania.
3464.58 And he figured out that the
urea was the same in both
3468.63 these mentally ill, manic patients
3470.82 and the non manic patients.
3472.62 So it did not seem that urea
3474.84 was the compound that was
creating these manic episodes
3478.68 or related to manic episodes
3480.72 or held the toxicity
3482.85 so instead he focused on the uric acid.
3485.79 Now in order to put the
uric acid into solution
3489.51 so that he could inject
it into these guinea pigs,
3491.79 he had to try a number
of different compounds
3493.89 in order to dilute it.
3494.82 It just so happens that,
3496.47 and you chemists will
be familiar with this,
3498.21 but there's certain
things that just don't go
3500.19 into solution easily.
3501.18 You put the powder in a vial,
3503.16 you add some water or a
saline or another solution,
3505.44 you mix it up and the powder
stays suspended in there,
3508.31 it doesn't actually ever
become a clear liquid
3512.61 that you can inject.
3513.96 So in order to try injecting
different strengths
3516.93 of uric acid,
3518.16 he ended up using lithium
3520.53 to assist in the dilution,
and lithium worked.
3523.74 So what he basically was doing,
3525.21 again for you chemists,
3526.11 is he was taking uric acid,
he was adding lithium,
3529.44 and making a solution of lithium urate.
3532.77 this is a lot of details,
but this is important
3535.44 because what he eventually found
3537.54 is that when he diluted the uric acid
3540.66 with lithium and created lithium urate,
3542.88 lithium urate could actually
3545.37 calm down these guinea
pigs that were injected
3548.04 with the toxic urea.
3550.35 He also found that lithium urate
3553.17 had a generally calming
effect on these guinea pigs.
3556.89 So now we're really
off in crazy territory,
3559.53 we're talking about urine from patients
3561.72 that's separating out urea and uric acid,
3564.9 we're adding lithium to the uric acid,
3567.03 we're injecting this into guinea pigs,
3568.323 this is getting pretty
wild and pretty weird,
3570.75 but this is medicine,
and from time to time,
3573.36 this is medicine and science.
3576.15 Cade was a good scientist in addition
3578.34 to being a good physician,
3579.9 and by good scientists,
3581.55 I mean that he did control experiments.
3583.5 Here he was injecting
lithium urate into animals
3588.39 and seeing an effect,
3589.62 but he knew that that
solution of lithium urate
3592.68 contained not just the uric acid,
3595.5 but it also contained lithium.
3597.03 And so he quite appropriately asked,
3600.09 maybe the lithium alone is
having this calming effect
3604.08 on these guinea pigs.
3605.46 And indeed, that was the case.
3607.26 When he did the proper control experiment
3609.21 and injected only lithium
solution into these guinea pigs,
3614.28 they calmed down.
3615.51 From there, he in sort
of 1940 style medicine,
3620.04 this would not happen now,
3621.99 he very quickly moved
from that animal model
3624.03 into human patients and started
injecting human patients
3627.72 with lithium or providing
lithium orally to those patients.
3631.65 And lo and behold, found
an absolutely profound
3636.12 and positive effect of lithium
3638.85 in reducing symptoms of mania.
3641.37 And as all good physician scientists do,
3644.04 he wrote up his results.
3645.72 And he wrote it up in a paper entitled,
3648.96 Lithium Salts in the Treatment
of Psychotic Excitement.
3652.38 Okay, back then they didn't call it mania,
3653.64 they called it psychotic excitement.
3655.89 This is a paper that was
published September 3rd, 1949
3658.71 in the Medical Journal of Australia.
3660.63 We will provide a link to this study,
3662.19 is now a classic study in
the field of psychiatry.
3665.52 It's a really wonderful paper to read.
3667.26 And actually I encourage people,
3669.27 even if you're not a
scientist or a clinician
3672.69 to just take a quick
look at the second page
3674.85 in this paper that we've
made available to you
3677.79 where he describes each of
the various case studies
3681.42 or the individuals that he looked at.
3683.58 I'm not going to read these in detail now,
3685.17 'cause it would take a
lot of unnecessary time,
3687.12 but things like case seven,
MC, aged 40-years-old,
3691.65 suffering from manic recurrent mania.
3693.44 In this episode, he'd
been excited, restless,
3695.37 and violent for over two months
3696.93 and was interfering so often
3698.175 that had to be confined to a single room
3699.57 during the day.
3700.5 So this is very debilitating,
3702.81 what we now know to be bipolar depression.
3705.93 He commenced taking
lithium citrate, 20 grains,
3708.33 that's a measure of the amount of lithium,
3710.37 three times a day.
3711.203 In four days, he was distinctly quieter
3713.76 and by February 13th, 1949,
appeared practically normal.
3718.47 He continued well and
on February 20th, 1949,
3720.93 the dose of citrate was
reduced to 10 grains,
3723.09 et cetera, et cetera.
3723.923 He left the hospital.
3725.37 There are numerous descriptions
3727.29 of this sort within this paper,
3728.76 including some descriptions of patients
3730.35 that did not see such success,
3732.87 and including some
descriptions of patients
3735.24 that suffered from some
negative side effects.
3738.21 So that's important to point out as well,
3740.01 but it's an absolutely wonderful paper
3742.26 and it's an absolutely wonderful voyage
3744.72 into the history of psychiatry
3746.31 right down to the discussion where
3748.05 in just three short paragraphs,
3750.3 Cade really lays out the case for why
3753.72 lithium is such a important discovery
3756.0 in the treatment of what, at that time,
3757.98 they were calling psychotic excitement
3759.48 and what we now know to be
manic bipolar depression.
3763.32 Lithium, I should mention,
3764.79 has a number of important features,
3766.41 but it also a number of
important side effects
3768.69 that need to be considered.
3769.71 First of all, it does have
3772.05 a certain toxicity and
so levels of lithium
3774.72 in the blood need to be
monitored extremely carefully.
3777.69 So it's not the sort of thing that people
3779.1 can just take at a given dose
3780.81 and every patient responds the same,
3782.46 there's a lot of oversight
and a lot of blood tests
3784.74 that have to be done,
3785.573 especially in the first three
months of lithium treatment.
3788.85 I should mention that lithium treatment
3790.26 is still used to some great
degree of success in many,
3794.16 not all people suffering
from bipolar depression,
3797.82 or bipolar disorder rather,
3800.34 but there are a number of
important things that happened
3803.85 between 1949 and present day
3806.49 that prevented lithium
from reaching patients
3810.63 that really needed it.
3811.47 And that all can be summarized
3813.15 in two or three short sentences.
3815.16 Basically, by virtue of
the fact that lithium
3817.98 is a naturally occurring element,
it could not be patented.
3821.31 And as a consequence of that,
3823.11 there wasn't a lot of potential profit
3825.06 for drug companies to produce lithium.
3827.04 In fact, still to this
day, it's very low cost,
3830.67 and still to this day, no
one really owns the patent
3834.09 for lithium in its purest form.
3836.28 So that made it unattractive.
3837.78 It turns out that the
FDA in the United States
3840.09 didn't allow lithium to
be used as a treatment
3842.58 for manic bipolar disorder until 1970.
3846.72 So we're talking about a full 21 years
3848.85 from the publication of this paper by Cade
3851.7 in the Medical Journal of Australia
3853.11 showing quite beautifully
3855.03 the great potential in use of lithium
3857.82 for quelling the symptoms
of bipolar disorder
3860.94 until the first patients
in the United States
3864.36 were starting to access lithium regularly.
3866.58 And nowadays, of course,
lithium is available,
3868.29 but still not able to be patented
3870.48 'cause it's element number
three on the periodic table,
3872.79 it's naturally occurring.
3874.17 It's not literally falling
down from the stars as stardust
3876.75 and going into pill form,
3877.74 but rather it can be synthesized
3880.53 in laboratories, but it is available.
3883.41 It does show not only great
potential in many patients
3887.04 but great application in many patients
3889.2 despite its side effects.
3891.12 So lithium really stands as
this kind of golden example
3895.23 of a treatment that works,
at least in many individuals,
3898.71 prior to an understanding
of the biological basis
3901.98 of the disease for which
that treatment is needed.
3904.92 Now with that said,
scientists and clinicians
3907.05 have been quite rigorous
in trying to understand
3909.78 why and how lithium works
in order to understand
3913.11 the why and how of bipolar disorder.
3915.24 This is the way that proper
medicine and science is done.
3917.58 Even if there's an excellent
treatment for something,
3920.13 it's important to understand
why that treatment works
3922.98 because, first of all, not everyone
3924.9 responds to that treatment.
3925.95 Second of all, scientists
and physicians understand
3929.4 that just because we have
one treatment that works,
3931.95 if it has any side effects at all,
3934.29 there is the possibility
for better treatments.
3936.72 So it's not just about
trying to bypass a drug
3939.87 that doesn't make much
money for drug companies,
3941.7 I know a lot of people
think in those terms,
3943.35 they think, oh, well,
3944.79 there's this continued
search for better treatments
3946.71 for bipolar disorder
even though lithium works
3948.96 because lithium doesn't
allow drug companies
3950.61 to make much money.
3951.66 That's not really the case.
3952.86 The fact of the matter
is is that the toxicity,
3955.23 some of the other issues that
are created with lithium,
3958.59 the fact that people need
3959.97 the ongoing blood testing, et cetera,
3962.88 really stimulates the
need, really an urgent need
3965.94 for new and better treatments
for bipolar disorder.
3968.13 And only by understanding
how lithium works
3970.32 at the cellular level, at
the neural circuit level,
3972.81 et cetera, do we really stand to find
3974.76 those new discoveries.
3976.02 If you were to do a literature search on
3979.17 the actions and mechanisms of lithium
3981.96 in terms of how it can calm people down
3984.24 and reduce their manic episodes,
3986.28 you would find an
enormous array of papers,
3989.01 literally thousands of scientific studies
3991.65 in animals and in humans,
3993.99 which, for instance will tell
you that lithium treatment
3997.2 will increase so-called BDNF,
3999.66 brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
4002.27 BDNF is often talked about in the context
4004.55 of neuroplasticity,
4005.69 the brain and nervous system's ability
4007.34 to change in response to experience.
4009.41 And indeed it does seem
that ingesting lithium
4013.34 increases BDNF.
4015.141 BDNF is what we call
permissive for neuroplasticity.
4019.28 It doesn't create specific
changes in the brain,
4022.07 meaning it's not going to
make your memory better
4024.41 or your coordination better,
4026.36 or your emotional state better per se,
4028.79 what BDNF does is it permits the neurons,
4032.54 the nerve cells and their
connections in the brain
4035.03 to be more likely to change
4037.91 if the proper environmental
conditions are met.
4041.57 That is BDNF creates a kind of
buoyancy to neuroplasticity.
4046.52 It opens the gates to neuroplasticity.
4048.95 So lithium does increase BDNF,
4051.23 we'll talk about why that's
important in the context
4053.03 of the neural circuits involved
4054.89 with bipolar disorder in a few minutes.
4057.41 It also seems to be a
potent anti-inflammatory.
4061.22 Now, inflammation is one of those words
4062.87 that's thrown around extensively nowadays,
4065.18 especially on social media
and especially as it relates
4067.52 to any health condition,
it's like inflammation,
4069.65 inflammation, inflammation,
always seems to be discussed
4072.62 in the context of inflammation being bad.
4074.45 But I do want to point
out that inflammation
4076.91 is a natural adaptive
response to physical injury
4080.15 to a cell or organ or tissue of any kind.
4083.21 Inflammation is the basis by which
4085.88 adaptations occur to exercise.
4088.25 So if, for instance,
4089.45 you were to weight train and use a heavier
4091.64 than normal weight kind,
4092.87 do a set to failure or create
some little micro tears
4095.81 in the muscle that are healthy
4097.19 in the sense that they
would create adaptations
4099.62 and make that muscle stronger,
maybe even grow that muscle,
4102.38 there's an inflammatory
response associated with that
4104.69 that is critical to the
positive adaptation.
4107.39 So inflammation isn't always bad,
4109.46 although excessive, or as we say,
4111.56 runaway inflammation is bad.
4113.9 Lithium seems to be able to
suppress inflammation and,
4117.74 importantly, it can suppress inflammation
4120.14 in neural tissues and within
the brain in particular.
4123.14 That is important.
4124.52 And we return to that
and why it's important
4126.98 in a little bit.
4128.36 The other thing about lithium
4129.83 is that lithium is neuroprotective,
4132.89 that is it can prevent neurons from dying
4136.13 under certain conditions.
4137.27 Why would neurons die?
4138.41 Well, there are a lot of
reasons why neurons can die.
4140.36 There can be a physical
insult to the neurons.
4141.92 You can get hit really
hard in the head, a bullet,
4145.16 God forbid, can enter the
skull and kill neurons,
4147.865 there are a lot of reasons
why neurons can die.
4150.56 Neuroprotection is a
situation in which a neuron
4154.91 is given some sort of chemical
or physical resiliency
4158.24 that allows it to suffer an insult
4160.85 and yet bounce back.
4161.93 So it's very similar to
the way that we think
4163.55 about psychological resiliency,
4165.02 neuroprotection is an ability for neurons
4168.23 to be better able to handle stress
4170.75 of different kinds, in
particular, excitotoxicity.
4174.23 There's a phenomenon in bipolar disorder
4176.57 and a lot of other psychiatric conditions
4178.67 in which hyperactivity
of certain brain areas
4181.73 actually starts to kill off neurons.
4184.43 Hyperactivity doesn't always do this,
4186.29 but it turns out that if
certain brain circuits
4188.12 are too active for too long,
4189.8 some of the chemicals
associated with neuroactivity,
4192.56 things like calcium and neurotransmitters
4194.72 like glutamate can actually
kill the very neurons
4196.88 that are active.
4197.84 So it seems that lithium can prevent
4199.61 some of that neurotoxicity.
4200.96 Now, this turns out to
be particularly important
4203.81 for this discussion about bipolar disorder
4205.73 and the neural circuit
basis of bipolar disorder
4208.43 because if we are just
take a step back and ask,
4210.59 what's different in the brains of people
4212.3 with bipolar disorder?
4214.07 There are some very interesting answers
4215.45 that start to emerge.
4216.89 There are basically two
main neural circuits
4219.41 that are present in normal individuals,
4222.59 I say normal, I say that respectfully
4224.72 to the people with bipolar disorder
4226.01 by referring to people who do not suffer
4228.98 from manic episodes or
from manic depression.
4232.49 There are circuits that are present
4233.78 in people with bipolar disorder
4236.24 and in people that do not suffer
4238.25 from bipolar disorder,
4240.5 both of those circuits do the same thing
4243.56 in both sets of individuals,
4245.39 and yet in people with bipolar disorder,
4247.85 there seems to be an atrophy or a removal
4251.18 of certain neural connections over time
4253.25 that leads to a situation in which people
4255.83 with bipolar disorder become very poor
4259.58 at registering their own internal state,
4262.25 in particular, their emotional states
4264.14 and their somatic states.
4265.85 What we're referring to here
4266.81 is something called interoception.
4268.46 I've talked about this a little bit
4269.45 on the Huberman Lab Podcast before,
4271.25 but there are two modes of perception.
4273.77 Perception, of course, is a attention
4276.68 to something that's
happening in our environment
4278.78 or to us on or within our body.
4281.96 Exteroception is literally
an attention to things
4285.47 that are happening beyond
the confines of our skin.
4287.9 So seeing that person's face over there,
4289.97 or seeing that color of leaf over there,
4292.67 or hearing a sound over to my left,
4294.65 that is exteroception,
perception of things
4297.23 beyond the confines of one's skin.
4299.63 Then there's interoception
4301.4 which is perception of things
that are happening internally
4304.22 like, how full does my gut feel?
4306.405 How fast is my heart beating?
4308.54 Some people can measure
that quite accurately
4310.49 just by thinking about
it, other people can't.
4313.31 How happy am I, how sad
am I, how energetic am I,
4316.91 how lethargic am I, et cetera, et cetera.
4319.01 So we are always existing in a balance
4320.72 between exteroception and interoception,
4323.45 but as it turns out, people
with bipolar disorder
4326.87 over time, and especially into the second
4329.21 and third decade of
having bipolar disorder
4331.97 seem to have progressively
diminished levels
4335.24 of interoception.
4336.774 And that very likely is important
4338.27 in their inability to
register, for instance,
4340.52 that, wow, they are talking
at an excessive rate
4343.76 or they haven't slept
in 5 or even 10 days,
4347.27 or they haven't eaten in
a long period of time.
4350.21 This atrophy of neural
circuits for interoception
4355.25 is starting to emerge
as one of the defining
4358.55 neural circuit characteristics
4360.02 or underpinnings of bipolar.
4362.15 Now I bridge to this conversation
about neural circuits
4364.88 from the statement that
lithium can protect
4368.69 against some of the neurotoxic effects
4371.66 of neural circuits being very active.
4373.4 Now this can get a little bit complicated,
4375.32 but I promise I'm going to make it clear
4377.06 for any of you that are
watching and or listening.
4379.79 The reality is
4381.89 that people with bipolar depression
4383.9 very likely have a hyperactivity,
4386.27 that is an increased level of activity
4388.01 in certain circuits within the brain
4389.57 early in the expression of their disease.
4392.39 And that typically, as
I mentioned earlier,
4394.31 sets in around the early
20s, although sometimes
4396.74 that can be even earlier,
in the teens and so forth.
4399.83 But that hyperactivity, we think,
4402.74 leads to a toxicity and excitotoxicity
4407.3 of certain elements of the neural circuits
4409.16 that are responsible for interoception.
4411.65 In other words,
4412.483 the overuse of certain
circuits can lead to a
4416.21 diminishing, an atrophy, or even a death
4418.31 of certain elements within those circuits
4419.99 and it appears that lithium,
4421.55 through its anti-inflammatory
and neuroprotective effects
4425.42 and through its ability to increase BDNF,
4429.17 very likely protects us against some
4431.27 of that atrophy of those
circuits for interoception.
4434.24 So this isn't a case in which
4436.4 people with bipolar have a neural circuit
4439.04 or lack a neural circuit
4440.06 and people without
bipolar are the opposite.
4442.22 This is a case in which
everyone more or less
4443.72 starts out the same,
4445.1 but it seems that there's a hyperactivity
4447.26 of certain neural circuits in people
4448.49 with bipolar disorder that over time
4451.01 actually causes those
circuits to diminish.
4453.41 Now, this is very important because some
4455.33 of the more recent longitudinal studies
4457.31 doing brain imaging on people
4458.51 with bipolar disorder and those without,
4460.52 and doing that over time in patients
4462.41 starting as early as their teens,
4463.85 but into their 20s and
30s reveals just that,
4467.63 that there can be hyperactivity
of circuits early on,
4469.91 but then hypo, reduced activity
of those very same circuits
4473.81 at a time 5 or 10 years later.
4476.36 Again, this speaks to
the complicated nature
4478.22 of bipolar disorder and
the complicated nature
4480.65 of psychiatry and linking
specific psychiatric disorders
4484.97 to neural circuits in general.
4486.83 Because if you have a situation in which
4489.8 in one disease, let's just,
4492.41 hypothesize here for a second
4493.58 that for instance, in certain
forms of schizophrenia,
4495.86 there's elevated dopamine
and where we to just reduce
4498.08 the amount of dopamine, that
they would receive relief
4500.12 from those schizophrenic symptoms,
4502.16 well, that's all pretty
straightforward on the face of it,
4504.41 but in this situation
with bipolar disorder,
4506.42 what we're talking about is hyperactivity,
4508.16 too much activity leading to hypoactivity
4511.52 through death of those very circuits.
4512.96 And so now you can
especially appreciate why
4516.8 when the patient shows
up to the psychiatrist
4519.08 or when the psychiatrist
shows up to the patient
4520.82 in the total course of their disease
4523.19 is going to be very important.
4524.42 And then layer on top of that
4525.86 the complexity of the fact
4526.88 that the very defining characteristic
4528.8 of bipolar disorder is that
there are oscillations in mood.
4531.86 So now we need to think about treatments,
4533.75 not just for the manic episodes,
4535.58 but also treatments for
the depressive episodes.
4538.07 And that's, in fact,
what psychiatrists do.
4540.38 Turns out that they apply
different treatments
4542.72 or combinations of treatments for patients
4544.97 that are in manic episodes
versus depressive episodes
4547.97 and they have to infer
all that from discussions,
4551.48 again, just exchange of words
4553.16 depending on when that person
walked into their office,
4556.73 where they are in terms of manic episodes,
4559.46 no symptomology or
depressive symptomology,
4562.07 and whether or not they've
had that symptomology
4564.5 for an extended period of time.
4566.0 And then just to make the
situation even more complicated,
4568.64 the very circuits that
atrophy that start to wane
4571.43 and disappear in people
with bipolar disorder
4573.5 are the circuits for interoception,
4575.57 for understanding of what's
going on in one's own body.
4577.79 So you can imagine if you
sit down and ask somebody,
4580.28 well, how long have, has it been
4582.41 since you've slept, that
person may genuinely not know.
4586.13 Or if you ask the very depressed person,
4588.68 how depressed are you?
4589.7 That person may not be
able to articulate that.
4592.55 So fortunately there are solutions to this
4594.89 and the solution is that
more often than not,
4598.58 the accurate understanding
of whether or not someone
4600.53 has bipolar depression or not,
4603.26 and what stage of the illness
they might be in or not
4607.19 is going to depend on the
reports of people around them
4610.31 and not the patient themselves,
4612.26 hence the importance of
having a rather detailed
4615.44 and admittedly a rather intense discussion
4617.57 about the symptomology
of bipolar disorder,
4619.88 so that you can have an understanding
4623.1 of the people around you
and have an eye and an ear
4626.15 to whether or not those
people might be suffering
4628.07 from bipolar, and if so, at
what stage of the disease
4630.68 they might happen to be at.
4631.97 Now I'd like to talk a little bit more
4633.26 about what is known
about the neural circuits
4635.27 that lead to the manic states,
4637.37 as well as the depressive states,
4638.63 but mainly the manic
states of bipolar disorder.
4642.29 We already discussed the
fact that interception,
4645.32 registering of one's own internal emotions
4647.51 and bodily states is diminished in people
4649.49 with bipolar disorder.
4651.14 But we haven't really talked
about the neural circuits
4653.27 that are responsible for
that lack of recognition.
4656.84 For that reason, I'd like
to point out a paper.
4658.97 This is a fairly recent paper,
just came out this year,
4661.73 but it's an excellent one,
4663.53 Looking at the changes over
time in neural circuitry
4666.38 in people with high genetic
risk for bipolar disorder,
4670.37 and in particular in young people.
4671.81 And studies of this sort are rare,
4674.33 but are exceedingly
important because of the fact
4676.67 that they track individuals over time.
4678.68 The title of this paper is,
4680.06 Longitudinal Changes in
Structural Connectivity
4682.4 in Young People at High Genetic
Risk for Bipolar Disorder.
4685.88 We will provide a link to this study
4687.56 in the show note captions.
4689.21 There are a lot of data in this paper,
4692.09 in particular, neuroimaging data,
4694.82 and it's quite extensive
in terms of analyzing
4697.52 the so-called connectomics.
4699.56 You've probably heard of genomics,
4701.09 which is the analysis of
genes and their display
4704.0 in different individuals or
different animals, et cetera.
4706.91 You have proteomics,
which is the display of,
4709.67 or the existence of different proteins.
4711.17 So omics is a big thing now in science,
4713.27 you kind of throw omics behind anything
4714.98 and it becomes its own Wikipedia page,
4717.32 which means it becomes its own thing,
4719.21 so to speak, I say that
only partially in jest.
4722.39 Nonetheless, connectomics
4724.52 is the analysis of connections
4726.92 between different neurons
and neural circuit elements.
4730.13 And what this paper really showed
4731.99 by analyzing the connectomics
of neural circuits
4734.39 in the brains of many different people
4737.18 with different categories
of, and onset of,
4741.83 and severity of
4744.47 bipolar disorder,
4745.43 as well as controls in
different age groups, et cetera,
4751.16 is that people who are
of particularly high risk
4754.94 for having bipolar disorder
4755.983 or that have full blown bipolar disorder,
4759.23 have deficits and actually reductions
4762.26 in the amount of connectivity between
4764.09 what are called the parietal brain regions
4765.89 and the limbic system.
4767.21 Now, the limbic system
I've talked about before
4768.8 in this podcast, if you're
not familiar with it,
4770.63 I'll explain what it is in a moment,
4772.91 it's simply a collection
of brain structures,
4774.77 not one brain structure,
4775.82 but a collection of brain structures
4777.74 that generally are responsible
4779.63 for shifting the overall
state that we're in
4783.23 from states of more relaxed and calm
4786.35 to states of more alert and focused.
4788.81 The limbic system is intimately related
4791.99 to the so-called autonomic nervous system,
4793.94 which regulates our sleep wake cycles
4796.07 and a number of other things
like our digestion, et cetera,
4799.01 our level of hunger and on and on.
4800.99 So the limbic system is really
kind of like a volume control
4805.07 or as nerd scientists like to say,
4807.5 a kind of gain control
on the overall level
4811.13 or amplitude of alertness or calmness.
4814.01 In fact, if we're very, very calm,
4815.6 we are asleep or even more
calm, we can be in a coma.
4818.63 If we are very alert, we can be wide awake
4820.97 and ready to work and run, et cetera.
4822.77 Or if we are very, very, very alert
4825.02 by way of limbic autonomic interactions,
4827.54 well, then we can be in anxiety.
4829.34 We can be in full blown panic attack,
4831.11 or we can be in mania.
4833.39 We can have so much energy
4835.01 that we feel like we don't need to sleep.
4836.117 And in fact, disruptions in the circuitry
4838.79 really seems to be what's going on
4841.1 in people who have bipolar disorder.
4843.83 Now, if disruptions in the circuitry
4846.98 are present in the limbic system,
4848.3 that doesn't necessarily
mean that the limbic system
4850.67 is at fault because the way
that neural circuits work
4853.13 is that different brain areas are talking
4854.57 to one another through
electrical-chemical signaling,
4857.06 and they're regulating one another.
4858.56 And what this paper really tells us
4861.05 is that there are elements
within the parietal lobe,
4863.3 which is a kind of a section of the brain
4864.89 that sits off to the side,
4866.21 it's not really off to the side,
4867.41 but in neuroanatomical nomenclature,
4870.74 the parietal lobe is connected
in two ways, bidirectionally.
4875.93 So parietal lobe is
connecting to limbic system
4878.18 and limbic system is
connecting to parietal lobe.
4880.31 And in people with bipolar disorder,
4881.99 it seems that the parietal lobe
4883.4 is able to exert less top down control,
4886.58 that is less suppression
of certain elements
4889.34 of the limbic system,
which, at least right now,
4893.3 is leading researchers to hypothesize
4895.4 that the limbic system is sort
of revving at higher levels.
4899.57 It's kind of like RPM in your cars
4901.25 or kind of redlining at
times and for durations
4904.85 that are inappropriate
or at least abnormal.
4907.25 So we have two major sets
of neural circuit deficits
4911.72 or changes in people with bipolar.
4913.61 Their lack of internal
awareness is reduced,
4915.68 and that turns out to be,
by way of neural structures,
4918.29 like the insula which is a brain region
4920.96 that is connected in a very direct way
4923.6 to our somatosensory cortex,
4925.7 so the part of our cortex that
4928.28 registers how we feel,
4929.81 literally, sense of
touch and internal state.
4933.11 So those circuits, excuse me,
4934.427 for those for those of you listening
4936.05 I just bumped the microphone, excuse me.
4938.33 Those circuits are disrupted
in people with bipolar
4942.05 and the top down control,
4944.27 that kind of accelerator and break
4946.04 on our overall levels of
energy are also disrupted.
4950.03 Now that's all fine and good
because, well, it's true,
4954.11 at least according to what the data
4955.73 at this point in time tell us,
4957.35 there may be new discoveries to come,
4958.76 but that all seems to be the case,
4960.62 but it doesn't tell us how to modulate
4962.33 or change that circuitry.
4963.98 It also doesn't tell us
how something like lithium
4967.25 can actually benefit a
large number of patients
4970.19 or how a good number
of the other treatments
4973.04 for bipolar disorder, which
we'll talk about going forward
4975.98 can benefit patients with bipolar.
4978.05 So it appears that lithium is exerting
4979.46 its positive effects on
bipolar depression treatment,
4982.7 at least in part by preventing the loss
4985.28 of certain neural circuits,
4986.3 namely the neural
circuits for interoception
4988.13 and the top down control
over the limbic system.
4990.89 Now it turns out to be
examining lithium's effects
4994.16 at an even more reductionist level,
4996.38 we can gain really important
insight into what's going on
4999.41 in bipolar depression and
some of the other treatments
5002.44 for bipolar depression,
including behavioral treatments,
5005.41 things like transcranial
magnetic stimulation,
5007.42 and even some of the more natural
5009.58 or so-called nutraceutical treatments
5011.77 including things like high
dose omega-3 supplementation,
5015.37 which we're going to
talk about extensively.
5017.44 Now, in order to
understand what we're going
5019.09 to talk about next, it's important
5020.56 that everybody understand a
key concept of neuroplasticity.
5024.01 And this is a key concept
regardless of whether or not
5026.47 one is talking about bipolar depression.
5028.45 In fact, it's something I think everybody,
5030.07 every citizen of earth should know about,
5032.56 and that's called homeostatic plasticity.
5035.05 Homeostatic plasticity
is a particular form
5037.75 of neuroplasticity in
which if a neural circuit
5041.17 is overactive for a period of time,
5044.5 there are changes that
occur at the cellular level
5047.5 that lead to a balance or
a homeostatic regulation
5052.03 of that circuit so that
it's no longer overactive.
5055.15 Conversely, if a neural
circuit is underactive
5058.06 for a period of time,
5059.23 certain changes happen within
the cells of that circuit
5062.17 to ramp up their activity
or make them more likely
5064.93 to be active.
5065.86 And whether or not a neural circuit
5067.9 and the neurons within
it become more active
5070.93 or less active in the context
of homeostatic plasticity
5074.14 largely depends on one mechanism,
5076.21 and it's a beautiful
mechanism that I'll make
5077.95 very clear to you right now,
5078.97 even if you don't have
a background in biology.
5081.31 Neurons communicate with one another
5082.99 by releasing so-called neurotransmitters,
5084.76 which are just chemicals.
5085.78 Those neurotransmitters are vomited out,
5088.27 they're not actually vomited,
5089.17 but they're spit out into
the so-called synaptic cleft,
5091.45 often called the synapse.
5092.5 The synapse is just a
little gap between neurons.
5094.96 And when they are
released into the synapse,
5098.35 they don't just stay there,
5099.28 they actually park or bind to receptors
5101.83 on what's called the postsynaptic neuron.
5103.81 And depending on how many
receptors they bind to
5107.11 and how many receptors
are available, et cetera,
5109.21 they can have a greater or lesser effect
5110.83 on the postsynaptic neuron.
5112.3 This scenario of
neurotransmitters being released
5114.91 into synapses then binding to receptors
5117.46 on postsynaptic neurons and influencing
5119.86 the electrical excitability
of those postsynaptic neurons
5122.53 sits central to not just the
treatment of bipolar disorder,
5125.71 but to all treatments of
all psychiatric conditions
5128.77 and indeed to things like
neuropathic pain as well.
5131.53 For example, the so-called SSRIs,
5134.98 Prozac, Zoloft and others, et cetera,
5137.95 stands for selective
serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.
5141.28 What does that mean?
5142.113 Well, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.
5143.98 It's actually a
neuromodulator that's released
5145.57 into the synapse, and then the SSRI,
5148.72 the selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor
5151.36 allows more of that serotonin
to sit within the synapse
5154.87 for longer, it's a re-uptake inhibitor,
5157.36 it prevents re-uptake by
the presynaptic neuron.
5160.087 and that serotonin therefore can park in
5162.79 or dock in the receptors, as it's called,
5165.147 of the postsynaptic
neuron in greater numbers,
5168.07 and have a greater impact
on that postsynaptic neuron.
5171.94 So the drugs that are
used to treat depression
5174.34 or other things of that
sort, things like SSRIs,
5178.0 work by changing the
availability of neurotransmitter
5181.27 in the synapse.
5182.11 Other things like MAO inhibitors,
5184.39 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
work a different way.
5187.48 They inhibit the enzyme.
5188.68 Anytime you hear ase in biology,
5190.48 it's very likely an enzyme
which breaks things down.
5193.87 so MAO inhibitors prevent the
breakdown, not the re-uptake,
5198.85 but the breakdown of neurotransmitter
5200.92 and therefore allow more neurotransmitter
5203.14 to be available in the synapse
5205.0 and influence the postsynaptic cell.
5207.49 Homeostatic plasticity is
a form of neuroplasticity
5212.26 in which overall circuits can
become much more excitable
5215.77 or much less excitable by the addition
5218.5 of more receptors in
the postsynaptic neuron
5221.5 or by the removal of more receptors
5223.51 from the postsynaptic neuron.
5224.65 And the way this happens
is just beautiful.
5226.66 It was first discovered
in the visual system
5229.24 and the person primarily responsible
5231.43 for the discovery of
homeostatic plasticity,
5233.29 although there are several,
5234.46 is a woman by the name of Gina Turrigiano,
5236.2 she's a professor at Brandeis University.
5238.42 And what the Turrigiano Laboratory showed
5241.39 was that for instance, if we
5244.27 are in the dark for a long
period of time, literally,
5246.82 and we're not seeing much
for a long period of time,
5248.83 there's an increase in
the number of receptors
5251.02 in the postsynaptic neurons
5252.4 so that a smaller amount
of light and excitability
5255.55 within the visual system can lead
5257.32 to greater amounts of
activity in the visual system.
5260.47 Conversely, if there's an overactivity
5262.81 or an increase in that
activity in the visual system
5265.0 for some period of time,
5266.65 then a number of receptors
in the postsynaptic neuron
5269.89 are removed from that
postsynaptic neuron surface,
5272.92 making any neurotransmitter
that's available
5275.74 only able to bind the
receptors that are left
5278.14 and have less of an
influence on those cells.
5280.54 In other words, keeping a circuit
5282.4 in so-called homeostatic balance
5284.71 in a particular range of excitability.
5287.77 Now, while that's a mouthful and an earful
5290.17 and a concept-full, I don't know
5291.82 if a concept-full is a
word, but in any case,
5293.74 that's a lot to think about,
5295.15 but all you need to know
is that if a neural circuit
5297.37 is very active for a period of time,
5299.05 in normal individuals,
there will be a reduction
5302.26 in the amount of activity
by way of removing
5304.78 receptors that bind neurotransmitter.
5306.55 Whereas, if a neural
circuit is very quiet,
5309.28 it's not activated for a period of time,
5310.78 maybe your leg is in a cast for instance,
5313.03 and you're not activating
your quadricep and calves
5315.91 very much, well when that cast comes off,
5318.55 sure, the muscle might be atrophied
5320.14 but the nerves that connect to that muscle
5322.0 are actually in a position
to influence that muscle
5324.46 even more once you start using
that muscle or those muscles,
5328.81 because whatever
neurotransmitter is released
5331.21 now has the opportunity
to bind to more receptors,
5334.81 in that case in muscle,
5335.74 or in the case of brain circuits,
in postsynaptic neurons.
5339.22 So homeostatic plasticity
is this beautiful,
5341.95 balancing mechanism that makes
sure that neural circuits
5344.38 are never too active nor
too quiet for too long.
5348.25 And in a beautiful display of how
5352.75 treatments can lead to a better
understanding of biology,
5355.84 which can lead to the discovery
5357.31 of even better treatments, lithium and
5361.51 another compound, which
we'll talk about, ketamine
5364.69 seem to exert their actions largely
5368.08 through effects on
homeostatic neuroplasticity.
5371.44 There's a wonderful paper that describes
5373.18 all the nitty-gritty of this.
5374.86 Certainly most people
listening, I'm guessing,
5377.17 are not going to be
interested in all this detail,
5380.56 but for those of you that you are
5381.7 and you want to delve deep into this,
5383.59 this paper was published in
Neuron Cell Press journal,
5386.08 excellent journal,
5387.67 it's titled, Targeting
Homeostatic Plasticity
5390.04 for the Treatment of Mood Disorders.
5391.69 And there's one particular
figure in this paper
5393.46 that I'll just describe to you
5394.87 in which measurements
were made from neurons
5398.5 and the number of
receptors in those neurons,
5400.54 it's done somewhat
indirectly through a method
5402.34 that's detailed and
neuroscientists are familiar with.
5405.01 Basically what it measures is how excited
5407.83 a given neuron is, electrically
excited a given neuron is
5410.56 to a given amount of neurotransmitter.
5413.44 So that the amount of
neurotransmitter that's vomited
5416.26 onto a neuron is
essentially kept constant,
5418.6 and then the response
5419.89 of the postsynaptic neuron is measured.
5421.69 So it can be of one
level or higher or lower
5424.42 depending on homeostatic plasticity.
5427.39 And what this paper shows
and what's been shown
5430.78 over and over again, is that
when neurons are exposed
5435.46 to lithium for a period of time,
5437.68 there is a reduction in the excitability
5441.67 of the postsynaptic neuron,
that is neurons within the brain
5444.85 become less excitable over
time if lithium is present,
5450.07 whereas ketamine, which is
now a common FDA-approved,
5453.85 at least in the US, it's
approved for the treatment
5456.28 of major depression,
ketamine does the opposite.
5459.25 Ketamine seems to increase
the number of receptors
5461.68 in the postsynaptic neuron
and lead to greater levels
5465.28 of excitability and electrical activity
5467.32 within neural circuits
to a given fixed amount
5469.99 of neurotransmitter.
5471.34 So this is super interesting
because what it means
5473.29 is that lithium is causing
circuits to be less active,
5476.56 ketamine is causing
circuits to be more active.
5479.17 And we know from excellent
clinical data now
5482.17 that ketamine seems to be
a very effective treatment
5485.41 for major depression, and for
the major depressive episodes
5490.3 of people that suffer
from bipolar depression,
5493.09 that includes these
major depressive episodes
5495.04 of two weeks or longer of
suppressed mood, appetite,
5498.1 sleep issues, et cetera.
5499.87 Now, the key thing about ketamine
5502.09 that's often not discussed
is that while its effects
5505.57 are very potent, they are transient.
5508.84 So one major drawback to
ketamine therapy for depression
5512.83 is that it has to be done repeatedly,
5514.6 and how repeatedly, or how often, rather,
5517.45 depends, of course, on a discussion
5519.22 between the psychiatrist and the patient.
5520.93 This is not something
to cowboy on your own.
5524.53 I know that, and many of
you are probably familiar
5527.05 with the fact that ketamine
also is abused recreationally.
5531.19 It is a so-called NMDA,
5533.08 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist,
5536.05 so it blocks the very
receptor that's responsible
5538.78 for neuroplasticity for
changes in neural circuits.
5541.69 It also changes excitability
in neurons as I just described.
5544.18 So ketamine is a very potent chemical
5546.31 that has been shown over and over again
5548.467 and is now FDA approved for the treatment
5550.57 of major depression, but its
effects seem to be transient.
5553.63 Lithium, as I described earlier,
5555.55 seems to reduce the manic episodes
5559.54 or the intensity of manic
episodes in symptomology,
5561.6 in people with bipolar disorder,
5563.29 it's doing that through neuroprotection.
5565.15 So protecting neural
circuits from dying away
5567.34 that initially are overactive
5568.99 and that overactivity
causing excitotoxicity,
5571.51 blocks that excitotoxicity, we believe.
5574.45 And it seems to do that in part
5578.2 by diminishing the amount of
activity in those circuits.
5581.47 So this is a beautiful mechanistic story,
5584.08 and it's the sort of story
that you'd love to have
5586.33 for a great number of
psychiatric illnesses.
5588.82 And fortunately we have
for bipolar disorder.
5590.95 Overactivity of a given circuit
5592.39 eventually leads to
neurotoxicity, excuse me,
5596.44 lithium is preventing that
neurotoxicity by reducing
5599.23 the number of receptors
in certain elements
5601.45 within those circuits, so
called homeostatic scaling,
5604.36 it's downregulating
the number of receptors
5606.82 leading to less
excitability and preventing,
5608.95 we think, excitotoxicity.
5611.02 And in that sense, you can see exactly why
5615.01 it's important to get lithium treatment
5616.45 in there early for people
with bipolar disorder.
5619.84 Ketamine as a treatment
for major depression
5621.58 seems to be effective but transient.
5623.59 And you can also see why
it would be important,
5625.72 not just to reduce the manic episodes
5628.209 for people with bipolar disorder,
5629.83 but to also treat the depressive episodes.
5632.17 So this is a key feature of the treatment
5633.85 for bipolar depression
and for bipolar disorder.
5636.88 there needs to be
treatment both of the mania
5639.07 and of the depressive
episodes if they're present.
5641.68 And fortunately, there are
excellent drugs to do that.
5644.53 And I should mention
that ketamine and lithium
5647.44 are just two of the drugs within the kit
5650.38 that psychiatrists have access to.
5652.39 There are many things, olanzapines
5655.057 and a number of different,
including Clozapine.
5658.27 Clozapine is an antipsychotic
5660.28 which is commonly prescribed to
5662.92 as a sedative in some
cases that allows people
5665.53 in manic episodes to sleep.
5666.82 It's classically described
5668.41 as so called dopamine
receptor 4 antagonist,
5671.23 although it does other things as well.
5672.88 Clozapine has a number
of side effect features
5675.79 related to white blood cell
5678.1 and things of that sort that
require careful monitoring.
5680.62 So there are an enormous number now,
5684.16 literally dozens and
dozens of different drugs,
5686.71 each designed to target
either the manic phase,
5689.86 the depressive phase, or
some what we call acute
5693.7 sort of early phases
versus ongoing treatments.
5696.25 This is a vast galaxy of drug treatments
5699.4 that really should be navigated,
5701.44 I should say, absolutely
should be navigated
5703.78 by a board certified psychiatrist.
5706.3 And of course in close discussion
5708.7 with both the person suffering
from bipolar disorder,
5711.82 but also ideally the family members
5714.37 of the person suffering
from bipolar disorder.
5716.8 But I think, at least up until now,
5719.95 we've focused on the two major pathways
5723.4 for treatment, lithium and ketamine.
5725.71 And we've talked about why
lithium and ketamine work,
5728.38 that they're working on opposite ends
5729.7 of this homeostatic scaling.
5730.9 We talked a bit about the
circuits that are involved
5733.57 in generating what we think
5735.28 are the manic symptomology
and the lack of interception.
5738.34 Why people can just
persist in staying awake,
5740.44 awake, awake, not eating, et cetera.
5743.05 Now you have in mind how
all that is put together.
5745.96 And I think you have in mind,
5747.4 some of the well-demonstrated treatments
5749.92 for the different component
parts of bipolar disorder,
5752.62 which now I'm hoping
you're also well versed in
5754.69 based on our early, early discussion
5757.15 of what constitutes
bipolar 1 and bipolar 2.
5760.03 Now I would like to also talk about
5762.22 some of the not so typical therapeutics
5764.92 for bipolar disorder and
also point to the things
5767.95 that have been tried and failed
5770.29 for successful treatment
of bipolar disorder,
5772.75 because some of those things
5775.09 are often talked about and suggested,
5777.52 especially in online communities,
5779.23 and while it's not clear that any of them
5781.21 are particularly hazardous on their own,
5784.3 although some of them
do carry some hazards,
5786.94 I do think it's important
because of the critical
5789.7 time sensitive nature of bipolar disorder
5791.77 and the urgency of
getting treatments early
5794.77 to try and prevent some
of the longer lasting
5796.93 neural circuit changes
that if people can avoid
5799.6 some of the less effective or demonstrated
5801.4 to be ineffective treatments,
5803.86 that they stand to combat bipolar disorder
5806.41 much more successfully.
5807.58 First of all, a key point
about drug therapies
5810.07 versus non-drug therapies
or talk therapies,
5814.3 without question, drug therapies
5817.36 are going to be most effective
5819.16 when done also with talk therapies.
5822.04 And we'll talk about which talk therapies
5823.39 have been demonstrated
to be most effective.
5826.18 There is some argument about
what I'm about to say next,
5828.55 but in general, most
psychiatrists will tell you,
5832.0 or certainly the ones I've
spoken to have told me,
5834.91 that talk therapy on its own
5837.46 is rarely, if ever effective
for bipolar depression
5842.38 and bipolar disorder, whether
or not it's BP-I or BP-II.
5845.68 That's just the reality of it.
5847.39 Contrast that with our discussion
5849.1 about obsessive-compulsive disorder,
5850.78 which we talked about a few episodes ago,
5852.7 if you haven't seen that episode,
5854.29 We have an in-depth episode all about OCD
5856.6 and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
5859.45 There it seems that drug
therapies and talk therapies
5862.63 can be done independently
or in combination.
5865.72 As expected, combined
drug and talk therapies
5869.14 are more effective there
than either one alone,
5871.3 but there are pretty impressive effects
5873.52 of talk therapy alone provided
5874.9 that they're initiated at the right time,
5876.31 and it's the right form of talk therapy.
5878.53 That's OCD, but in terms
of bipolar disorder,
5881.38 it really seems that the
drug therapies are necessary,
5884.86 at least in most all cases.
5887.92 That said, talk therapies
are terrific augment
5892.0 or support for those drug therapies
5893.59 and sometimes can allow people
5894.73 to take lower doses of
those drug therapies,
5896.68 which turns out to be important
5897.85 because of the side
effect profiles of a lot
5899.34 of drug therapies and
sometimes the cost as well.
5902.05 I guess we can think of cost
5902.98 just as another side effect really.
5905.74 There are both established
and more novel forms
5908.77 of talk therapy being used, again,
5911.53 in concert with drug treatments
for bipolar disorder.
5915.61 Cognitive behavioral therapy is the one
5917.53 that seems to be best,
5918.73 at least by way of the
statistics and papers that exist.
5921.67 It's also the one that's
been explored the most.
5923.35 So one of the reasons
why it's often considered
5925.45 the most popular or effective
5926.68 is 'cause it's also been around longer
5928.12 and it's been explored the most.
5929.08 Cognitive behavioral therapy in general
5931.84 is a progressive exposure of the patient
5935.47 in a very controlled way,
in a clinical setting,
5937.48 to some of the triggers or the conditions
5940.21 that would exacerbate bipolar disorder.
5942.79 Now, earlier I said borderline
personality disorder
5945.4 has all these triggers
and triggered elements
5947.89 from the external environment,
5948.94 whereas bipolar disorder does not.
5950.89 And that's still true, but
5954.28 it is the case that somebody with bipolar
5956.8 can have worse symptoms if life conditions
5959.47 get worse or more stressful.
5960.52 So cognitive behavioral therapy,
5962.56 I mean the discussion about
5964.12 and sometimes the direct exposure to
5967.24 anxiety provoking elements of life
5969.34 can be very helpful for
adjusting the responses
5973.72 to those otherwise triggering events
5975.4 and sometimes making the drug treatments
5976.87 more effective even at lower doses.
5978.61 There are also forms of therapy
5980.47 including family-focused therapy,
5982.78 which is especially important in terms
5985.36 of bipolar disorder because
5988.24 family members, provided
that they are not themselves
5991.33 in a manic episode due to the
5992.818 close heritability of bipolar disorder,
5995.83 but family members can
often be excellent windows
5999.64 into whether or not somebody
is doing well or poorly,
6002.76 or is veering toward or is emerging from
6005.25 a manic or depressive episode
6006.93 because they understand that person,
6008.19 they have a lot of data,
6009.75 it could be purely subjective data,
6011.19 but they have a lot of
exposure to how long
6012.93 or well somebody's been
sleeping or eating, et cetera.
6015.39 So family-focused therapy
involves other members
6017.4 of the person suffering from
bipolar disorder's family,
6020.25 as well as conversations
about family members
6024.09 in a way that helps patients
6025.77 with bipolar disorder navigate,
6027.6 not just through manic episodes
and depressive episodes,
6029.79 but start to learn to predict
what are the conditions
6032.88 psychological, physical, and otherwise
6035.07 that can trigger bipolar episodes.
6038.1 And then there's a category of therapy
6041.04 called interpersonal and
social rhythm therapy.
6044.07 This is deserving of its
own entire episode really.
6048.24 Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy,
6049.98 it's sort of an expansion
on family-focused therapy,
6053.01 although it's distinct
in certain ways as well,
6055.35 and really focuses on how
people are relating to others
6059.19 in their life, and in the workplace,
6061.41 and in the school environment,
6063.0 and also within the family, et cetera.
6064.98 And I should say that a overall theme
6067.89 that's emerging in
psychiatry and psychology
6070.47 is to start wherever
possible to incorporate
6073.56 more of the social aspects
6075.51 and the interpersonal aspects.
6077.07 In other words, not just talking to
6078.72 and examining a patient
as one biological system,
6081.45 one nervous system, one set
of chemicals, and one life,
6084.57 but rather a set of
chemicals, neural circuits,
6087.03 and a life that's
embedded in the chemicals
6088.95 and neural circuits and
lives of other people.
6091.324 Just by way of example, you can imagine
6093.24 that if somebody is in a
very healthy relationship
6095.94 or a very abusive relationship,
6097.83 that that's going to strongly impact
6099.9 the outcomes of manic episodes.
6101.73 You can imagine that if
the financial situation
6104.4 is one in which people can
recover from manic episodes,
6107.58 I didn't mention this
earlier, but I should have,
6109.59 forgive me, that oftentimes people
6111.45 who are in a manic episode will go out
6113.04 and spend immense amounts of money
6114.78 that they simply cannot afford to lose.
6116.97 And then the depressive
episodes that, in many cases,
6120.12 follow are made far worse
by the financial anxiety
6125.1 and the financial stress that results
6127.26 from those manic episodes
of spending, et cetera.
6129.48 And then of course, this carries over
6131.13 to sexual promiscuity where
people might be dealing
6134.76 with unwanted pregnancy or STIs, or
6138.42 very fractured interpersonal dynamics
6140.76 with existing or new relationships.
6142.35 I mean, you can imagine
how these manic episodes,
6145.98 as well as the depressive episodes
6147.63 can really wick out into an
enormous amount of destruction,
6151.08 which brings us back
to the initial criteria
6154.14 of BP-1 and BP-2 is that
these manic episodes
6157.35 are not a good thing.
6159.15 These depressive episodes
are not a good thing.
6162.63 They create this sense of euphoria
6164.64 in the person experiencing mania,
6166.22 or they create this sense
that anything is possible.
6168.87 But at the end of the day,
and actually every day,
6172.41 these episodes are quite maladaptive.
6174.72 They really destroy people's lives.
6176.43 And it's not just the life of the person
6178.02 that's suffering from bipolar disorder.
6179.217 And so hence cognitive behavioral therapy,
6181.71 family-focused therapy and interpersonal
6183.6 and social rhythm
therapies are the primary
6185.52 three talk therapies that
are most often combined
6188.4 with drug therapies in order to try
6190.41 and really reduce the harm.
6192.87 It's really all about harm reduction
6195.78 from manic episodes and
depressive episodes.
6198.27 One very exciting and emerging treatment
6200.22 that does show great promise,
6202.56 and in some cases, great outcomes,
6204.6 for bipolar disorder is, believe it or not
6207.48 electric shock therapy.
6209.19 Electric shock therapy may sound barbaric,
6211.26 and in fact, it tends to look barbaric,
6213.27 although this is done in
the controlled setting
6214.92 of a hospital.
6215.76 If any of you have seen One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,
6218.49 the final scene or near
final scene in that movie
6221.67 was Jack Nicholson with
the sort of bite protector
6225.36 in his mouth and getting
electric shock therapy,
6227.58 and it's as the name suggests,
it's a kind of inducing
6232.02 a global seizure, either low
level or grand mal type seizure
6237.09 in the patient's brain and nervous system.
6239.76 You might ask, well, why
would one want to do that?
6242.61 Well, it turns out that
this is a well-established,
6246.03 and in many cases, very
effective treatment
6248.4 for major depression.
6249.63 Electric shock therapy is generally used
6252.45 for treatment-resistant depression.
6254.34 So these are people that
have no positive response
6257.64 or ongoing positive
response to drug therapies
6259.64 or other therapies.
6260.85 Electric shock therapy is thought to work
6263.07 primarily by stimulating the massive kind
6266.4 of indiscriminate release of things
6268.08 like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,
6271.26 a huge variety of neuromodulators,
6273.84 as well as things like BDNF,
6275.58 brain-derived neurotrophic factor
6276.81 which then allows
neuroplasticity to take place.
6279.3 Again, BDNF being permissive
for neuroplasticity.
6282.3 The problem with ECT is
that it's really only useful
6285.18 for treatment-resistant depression,
6287.16 it doesn't actually
target the manic aspects
6289.47 of bipolar depression
and bipolar disorder,
6292.38 but nonetheless, is used when
drug treatments don't work.
6296.01 Some of the negatives of
electric shock therapy
6299.57 or electric convulsive therapy, ECT,
6302.52 is the proper acronym
and way it's described
6305.19 is that it's quite invasive, right?
6306.66 This is something that you
need to go to the hospital for
6309.09 and oftentimes there's some
inpatient care required
6311.52 after the electric convulsive therapy.
6314.07 It's a fairly high cost,
6315.39 especially for those that
don't have insurance.
6317.79 And of course it requires anesthesia.
6320.1 For most people, that's
not going to be a problem,
6321.6 but for many people
that could be a problem.
6324.69 And there's often some
associated memory loss.
6328.35 And so the memory loss,
the invasive nature of ECT
6333.36 and the cost oftentimes rule
out ECT for most patients,
6337.62 and that's why it's sort of a late stage
6339.21 or kind of last resort type thing
6341.1 for treatment-resistant depression.
6342.75 Nowadays ketamine type
therapy is done repeatedly
6345.57 or other treatments, for instance,
6347.58 transcranial magnetic stimulation
6350.13 which is basically non-invasive,
6352.11 it's a coil that's placed on the outside
6353.94 of the skull, excuse me.
6357.03 And we can more accurately refer to it
6359.76 as repetitive or rTMS,
6362.28 repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation.
6364.89 Transcranial magnetic
stimulation is a tool
6367.65 that allows researchers and clinicians
6369.69 to reduce the amount of activity
6371.28 in specific neural circuits.
6372.51 So they can actually
target the magnetic field
6375.18 to particular neural
circuits to reduce activity
6377.1 in those neural circuits.
6378.36 Again, it's minimally invasive.
6380.01 It has been shown to be effective
6381.69 in both increasing
neuroplasticity in positive ways,
6385.47 as well as reducing depressive episodes
6387.57 and in a few instances in reducing
6390.69 the amplitude or the
intensity of manic episodes
6393.63 in people with bipolar disorder.
6395.73 The problem is it's still
a very early technique.
6399.06 There aren't a lot of
clinics and labs doing it.
6401.1 I'm starting to see more advertisements,
6402.93 literally commercial clinics
6405.21 that are advertising rTMS or TMS.
6408.12 I encourage you to approach
those clinics with caution.
6410.61 I'm of the mind that if those clinics
6413.37 are not either closely
or maybe even distantly
6416.46 associated with a research institution
6418.2 that's really up on the latest of rTMS,
6420.6 you'd be wise to at
least do your research,
6423.39 and explore, talk to other patients
6425.91 who've done these treatments,
6427.38 but certainly in university hospitals
6429.54 and in clinical settings
and research settings,
6431.61 rTMS is being used as
a way to, for instance,
6435.18 reduce the activity of
certain limbic circuitries
6437.76 so that people are just overall
less excitable and manic
6440.46 or to activate because it can also be used
6443.34 for activation now of
certain neural circuits.
6445.02 Activate, for instance,
the parietal inputs,
6447.18 the top down control
over the limbic system.
6449.19 This is all happening right now.
6450.96 So we have ECT, repetitive TMS or rTMS,
6454.92 and then as I mentioned
earlier, ketamine therapies,
6456.99 most of those are targeted
toward the depressive aspects
6459.78 of manic depression.
6461.4 So for people with bipolar disorder
6462.96 that doesn't include depression,
6464.31 those are going to be less effective,
6465.93 but overall, it's going
to be the talk therapies
6468.35 of the sort that we discussed
earlier, or a moment ago.
6471.93 Plus drug treatments,
6474.57 almost always lithium will be explored,
6476.28 plus some treatments for
the depressive episodes
6478.95 in particular if those
depressive episodes are present.
6481.89 Nowadays, there's a lot of
excitement about psilocybin
6484.98 which is a psychedelic.
6486.33 In the US, psilocybin is still illegal.
6489.15 It is not legal, meaning you
can get in a lot of trouble
6492.93 for possessing it, certainly
for selling it, et cetera.
6495.84 But psilocybin is being explored
6497.43 as a clinical therapy in
certain laboratory settings
6500.01 in particular, at Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine.
6502.65 It's being explored in human patients
6504.24 for the treatment of major depression,
6505.77 for OCD I believe as well,
6508.44 but certainly for major depression
and for eating disorders.
6511.2 And it seems from the
initial wave of publications
6514.32 from that work done by the
incredible Matthew Johnson
6517.86 or Dr. Matthew Johnson, who was a guest
6519.63 on this podcast before,
6520.62 he's also been on the Tim Ferris Podcast,
6523.32 he's been on the Lex Fridman Podcast.
6525.57 Dr. Matthew Johnson came on this podcast,
6528.12 he's talked about some of the work
6529.05 with psilocybin for the
treatment of depression.
6531.63 Very impressive results there.
6534.09 And as you can imagine,
very impressive results
6536.28 for the major depressive
episodes for bipolar.
6538.5 However, at least to my knowledge,
6541.08 again, to my knowledge,
6542.58 there have not been any
controlled clinical trials
6544.95 exploring psilocybin
for the mania associated
6547.95 with bipolar disorder.
6548.97 If someone out there is aware
of those clinical trials,
6551.31 please let me know.
6552.143 I'll do an update in a future podcast,
6553.95 but right now, no knowledge from me
6556.92 about psilocybin clinical trials
6558.66 for the manic component
of bipolar disorder.
6562.35 A number of people are
probably also going to wonder
6564.42 about whether or not cannabis
6566.67 or medical marijuana is
useful for bipolar disorder.
6571.02 To address this, I looked
to some previous lectures
6574.23 and some clinicians at
Stanford Psychiatry.
6577.59 This question was asked of
them, and as it turns out,
6580.98 cannabis does not seem to be effective
6583.41 for the treatment of the manic phases
6585.45 of bipolar disorder or for the treatment
6588.06 of the major depressive component.
6590.34 The only treatment perhaps,
6592.74 or I should say the only situation perhaps
6595.14 in which it might be useful,
6595.973 and this is what was relayed to me,
6597.72 is that it may help with
sleep in certain people
6600.6 that are having trouble with insomnia,
6603.48 though nowadays, it's far
more common for people
6606.09 in manic episodes to be prescribed things
6607.98 like Trazodone or other
benzos, benzodiazepines
6611.76 in order to try and get sleep
6613.17 within the manic episodes.
6614.34 And benzodiazepines and
Trazodone, et cetera,
6616.98 work largely through the
so-called GABA system.
6619.23 This is a neurotransmitter
6621.24 that causes reductions in
excitability of neurons,
6625.14 hence why it's being used
to try and calm people down
6627.78 and allow them to sleep
during their manic episodes.
6629.88 So not a lot, or essentially no data,
6632.01 supporting the use of
cannabis for the treatment
6633.75 of bipolar disorder, per se,
6635.79 nor data supporting the use of psilocybin
6638.49 for the treatment of
bipolar disorder per se.
6640.44 But I realize, as I say that,
6643.05 that there are going to
be a number of people
6644.43 that may have had positive
or negative experiences
6648.36 with cannabis or psilocybin
6649.56 as they relate to bipolar disorder.
6651.0 So please, if you're
willing or comfortable,
6653.82 put that, if you're comfortable,
6654.96 into the comment section on YouTube.
6657.66 And of course, if you
are aware of any studies
6659.64 on cannabis or psilocybin
showing positive outcomes
6663.06 for the treatment bipolar
disorder, please provide links
6666.21 or PubMed ideas to those, I'd
love to peruse those studies.
6670.2 There are two naturopathic,
or I should say,
6673.26 nutrition, supplement-based
approaches to bipolar disorder.
6677.07 They get talked about a
lot, and one of them shows
6680.67 some interesting promise,
or effectiveness even,
6683.52 in a limited context.
6686.19 Before marching into this description
6688.26 of these two compounds, in
fact before even mentioning
6691.2 these two compounds,
I do want to emphasize
6694.23 what's been said and written
about over and over again
6697.5 and what was relayed to me
from expert psychiatrists.
6702.93 It is not wise to rely
purely on talk therapy
6705.72 or on natural approaches to the treatment
6708.59 of bipolar disorder given
the intensity of the disorder
6712.68 and the high propensity for suicide risk
6716.25 in people with bipolar disorder,
6717.81 it is a chemical and
neural circuit disruption,
6720.57 and it needs to be dealt with head on
6722.25 through the appropriate chemistry
6725.01 and prescription drug approaches
6726.87 from a board-certified psychiatrist.
6729.09 I don't say this to protect me,
6731.31 I say this truly to protect
those who either suffer from
6734.76 or think they may suffer
from bipolar disorder
6736.55 or if you know someone
who you think might suffer
6738.75 from a bipolar disorder.
6740.82 Now, all that is not to say
6742.59 that there aren't useful
lifestyle interventions
6744.93 that can support people
with bipolar disorder.
6746.82 So I just briefly want to mention those.
6748.47 And again, I'm lifting the
statements I'm about to make
6750.99 from some excellent online lectures
6753.78 from psychiatrists at
Stanford and elsewhere,
6756.48 which essentially say that,
6758.76 of course, of course, of course,
6761.94 getting better sleep,
getting adequate exercise,
6765.09 getting proper nutrition, having quality,
6768.03 healthy, social interactions,
6770.58 even getting regular sunlight in the day
6772.41 and avoiding bright light at night,
6773.7 all of those things are
going to braid together
6777.0 to support the nervous
system and the psyche
6779.64 of somebody with bipolar disorder,
6781.993 but they braid together
to support the psyche
6784.86 and the neurochemistry
and the neural circuits
6786.48 of anybody and everybody.
6788.37 So they have generally a modulatory effect
6791.22 that is they're indirectly shifting
6794.22 the likelihood that somebody
might have an episode,
6797.19 or the intensity of an episode,
6799.26 in particular, the depressive episodes.
6801.15 You can imagine how someone who's heading
6802.38 into a depressive episode,
6803.79 maybe they're on a lower
amount of medication
6805.56 or they haven't yet medicated
6807.15 for the depressive episode of bipolar.
6809.19 And now they're making sure
or their family is making sure
6812.49 that they're getting exercise, sunshine,
6814.05 eating correctly, social
engagement, et cetera.
6816.78 Of course it makes perfect sense
6818.1 why they would have
perhaps a shallower drop
6820.65 into depression or maybe an offset
6822.39 of depressive episode.
6823.92 That said, most all, if not all people
6827.52 with bipolar disorder are likely to need
6829.86 some sort of drug therapy intervention
6832.62 in order to help them.
6833.88 So lifestyle factors are always important
6836.82 in all individuals,
6838.29 those suffering from
psychiatric conditions or not.
6842.55 But in some conditions
of the mind and body,
6845.46 those lifestyle interventions
can have a greater effect
6848.13 in offsetting symptoms,
whereas in bipolar disorder,
6851.25 I think it's naive, and
in fact, wrong to say
6853.86 that lifestyle interventions alone
6856.32 are going to prevent,
especially the extreme forms
6858.81 of mania and depression.
6860.61 Again, bipolar disorder being so serious
6863.13 and carrying such high suicide risk,
6865.44 we just have to point
this out again and again.
6867.51 Now with that said,
there are two substances
6869.73 generally found as supplements,
6871.83 although there are other
sources of them as well,
6873.78 including within nutritional sources
6875.94 that have been shown, at
least in some studies,
6878.34 to be pretty effective
in adjusting the symptoms
6882.35 of bipolar disorder, and
those two things are inositol
6886.17 and omega-3 fatty acids.
6888.75 Now inositol is a compound
6891.66 that is taken for a variety of reasons.
6893.4 It's something we've talked
about on the podcast before.
6895.44 I personally take inositol not because
6897.18 I have bipolar disorder,
in fact I am quite lucky
6899.58 that I don't have bipolar disorder,
6902.13 but I take inositol, a 900
milligrams of myo-inositol
6905.22 every third night or so in
order to improve my sleep.
6907.8 It's something that I've
added to my sleep stack.
6909.66 It's something that I
found greatly enhances
6912.39 the depth and quality of my sleep.
6914.49 And if I wake up in
the middle of the night
6916.11 to use the bathroom, et cetera,
6917.37 it's greatly enhanced my
ability to fall back asleep
6920.61 when I want to go back to sleep.
6922.02 It also seems to have a fairly potent
6924.24 anti-anxiety effect during the day.
6926.79 And as I discussed in our episode
6929.19 about obsessive-compulsive disorder,
6930.84 inositol has been used at high dosages,
6934.02 again, I should say
myo-inositol has been used
6935.85 at high dosages, at levels
of even 10, 18 grams,
6940.29 those are massive dosages by the way,
6942.42 to deal with certain symptoms
of OCD to limited success.
6946.68 And I should mention that
high dosages of 10 or 18 grams
6950.16 of inositol can cause a lot
6952.35 of gastric discomfort, et cetera.
6954.45 If you want to learn more about inositol
6957.24 and its various uses, I encourage
you to go to examine.com
6960.93 where there's the so-called
Human Effect Matrix,
6963.54 and that Human Effects
Matrix will describe the many
6966.63 places in which myo-inositol
and other forms of inositol
6969.99 have been show shown to be effective
6971.88 in, for instance, reducing anxiety,
6973.44 enhancing sleep and on and on.
6975.78 Myo-inositol is important
because myo-inositol,
6979.35 and we can just say inositol,
6981.42 is related to so-called
second messenger pathways.
6984.15 I don't want to get too deep
into second messenger pathways,
6986.25 but when certain substances
bind, like neurotransmitters
6989.67 to a receptor on a cell surface,
6991.65 oftentimes those receptors
themselves will open
6994.17 and allow the passage of ions
and other things into a cell.
6997.26 Oftentimes they will engage
6999.21 what are called second messenger systems
7001.01 that is they will trigger
mechanisms within the cell
7003.86 to then go do other things.
7005.48 This is probably something
we should get into
7007.04 in real detail in a future episode
7008.75 for those of you that
really want to nerd out
7010.4 on cell-cell signaling, which
is a favorite topic of mine.
7013.43 In any case, inositol is related
7016.04 to a number of so-called
second messenger systems,
7018.38 this handoff, or this kind of stimulating
7021.41 of changes within a cell
that can inspire changes
7025.52 in what's called membrane fluidity,
7027.59 can actually make the membranes of cells,
7030.35 the outside fence around a cell,
7032.84 which is made up of fatty stuff,
7036.05 it can change the fluidity,
7037.55 meaning how readily things can float
7040.43 around in the membrane.
7041.51 You know, we think of cells as very rigid,
7043.16 like there's a cell, there's a neuron,
7044.75 or there's a immune cell,
7045.98 but actually those cells
have a fatty outside,
7049.82 in particular neurons
have a fatty outside.
7051.98 It's a thin fatty outside,
it's called the cell membrane,
7055.4 and things are floating
around in that cell membrane,
7057.83 but it's kind of like jello
that hasn't quite fixed.
7060.29 And so things like receptors
moving into the synapse
7063.38 or moving out the synapse
for homeostatic plasticity,
7066.38 things like the ability for certain genes
7070.7 to be turned on in a
cell or not turned on,
7072.56 can depend a lot on
things that are happening
7074.96 in that cell membrane and how readily
7076.7 things move around in the cell membrane.
7078.35 One way to think about this whole picture
7079.94 of membrane fluidity is that just imagine
7082.73 that everyone of your
cells has this layer,
7085.04 it's kind of a gelatinous-like layer
7087.38 and there are lots of little rafts
7089.09 floating around in there, but those rafts
7092.81 are able to move more quickly
7095.3 from one place to
another, or get more stuck
7097.76 at one place or another,
depending on how set
7099.53 that jello is.
7101.21 Inositol
7102.8 and lithium,
7104.9 and as we'll talk about
next, omega-3 fatty acids
7108.98 seem to change the fluidity
of those membranes,
7112.1 in other words, they
allow things to move in
7114.23 and out of those membranes
more readily or not.
7117.32 And this is no surprise given that
7121.7 those membranes are
made out of fatty stuff.
7124.82 In particular, the membranes of neurons
7127.16 are what called a lipid bilayer,
7129.2 it's two layers of fat,
bi means two, lipid, fat.
7134.33 And omega-3 fatty acids
of the sort that are found
7137.54 in certain fish, and that
fatty fish in particular,
7141.5 and that are found in fish oil
and cod liver oil, et cetera.
7146.36 Omega-3 fatty acids, when we ingest them
7149.09 are used for a lot of different things,
7151.19 but they can be readily
incorporated into pathways
7154.58 or directly incorporated
into cell membranes,
7157.61 changing the way those cell membranes work
7159.68 and if those cell membranes
are the cell membranes
7161.87 of neurons, changing the
way that neurons work.
7164.36 So the ability for fish oil,
7167.78 and in particular, the
omega-3 fatty acids,
7170.27 which come in varieties like EPA and DHA,
7172.73 we'll talk about that in a moment,
7174.11 have been explored at
relatively high dosages
7176.84 for their ability to
offset some of the effects
7180.02 of mania and to offset the effects
7183.26 of depressive episodes
in bipolar disorder.
7186.11 And actually, the data there
7187.46 are pretty impressive, although,
7190.07 although they are varied,
7192.8 meaning you will find several studies,
7195.32 and I'll mention a few,
that found no effect
7197.78 of omega-3 supplementation
through fish oil,
7200.09 usually it's capsuled fish oil,
7201.53 although fish oil can
also be taken, excuse me,
7203.81 in liquid form.
7204.77 Oftentimes taking in liquid form
7206.09 is the more cost efficient way to do it.
7207.8 Taking in capsule form is the
more palatable way to do it,
7210.92 because fish oil for a lot
of people doesn't taste good.
7213.59 But nonetheless,
7215.9 there are several studies that have shown
7217.55 that supplementing with fish
oil or omega-3 fatty acids
7221.57 at levels of, for instance,
four grams per day
7225.05 for a period of time,
7225.92 this is a study that we
will link in the show notes,
7227.66 This is Murphy at al. 2012.
7229.91 This is a fatty acid
supplementation of 70% EPA to DHA
7235.1 actually worsen symptoms of mania
7237.56 over a period of about 16 weeks,
7239.9 which on the face of it
makes it seem like, okay,
7242.03 omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
7243.8 very likely to not be
good for bipolar disorder.
7247.1 And yet that was the manic phase.
7250.46 When one looks at some
of the other studies
7252.14 of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,
7254.69 there is, for instance, a
study published in 1999,
7258.08 this is a much higher
dosage supplementation
7261.2 with omega-3 fatty acid,
7262.31 this is a 9.6 grams of fish
oil per day for four months.
7266.81 And then actually greatly reduced symptoms
7270.16 of bipolar depression
compared to the control
7274.49 group which received olive oil,
7276.29 olive oil is a different form
of fat, monounsaturated fat
7279.5 but doesn't contain as much
7280.82 of the omega-3 fatty acids and so forth.
7282.89 So 9.6 grams of fish oil
per day over four months
7287.42 is a lot of fish oil
7289.88 to be ingesting on a given day.
7291.59 This was a double blind study.
7293.93 This was only carried out, I
should mention, in 30 subjects,
7296.75 but it was males and females.
7298.4 And the age range was pretty broad,
7299.87 anywhere from 18 all the
way up to 64 years of age,
7302.51 which is important given
7304.037 the sort of longitudinal
or changes over time,
7306.92 that one sees in bipolar disorder.
7309.05 Here's the major takeaway,
7310.85 supplementing with high dose omega-3s
7312.83 does seem to be beneficial
for a good number of people
7316.04 with bipolar disorder.
7317.6 However, again, I want
to highlight, however,
7320.33 it should not be viewed as
the only treatment approach
7323.69 for bipolar disorder.
7324.56 This goes back to what I was saying before
7326.36 about the essential
need, in most every case,
7329.09 for high potency
prescription drug treatments
7332.36 prescribed by board
certified psychiatrists
7334.13 for bipolar disorder.
7335.0 However, omega-3 supplementation
does seem to improve
7340.79 or reduce the depressive symptoms
7342.47 in the major depressive
episodes of bipolar.
7344.39 And there are a couple studies,
7345.86 and we'll link to these
in the show notes as well,
7347.9 that show that it may even improve
7349.64 some of the manic episodes as well,
7351.98 meaning it reduces some
of the manic symptoms.
7354.89 Now I say all this from
a place of great caution,
7358.1 because I know, especially
for listeners of this podcast,
7361.1 there's a lot of interest
in the behavioral tools,
7362.93 the supplement-based tools,
7363.89 the nutrition tools that can
support bipolar disorder,
7366.29 but I don't think I can
overemphasize enough
7368.6 that especially for bipolar disorder
7370.307 and the great risk of
suicide and suffering
7373.1 and inappropriate spending,
7375.11 or I should say maladaptive
spending and impulsivity
7377.48 that's associated with bipolar disorder,
7379.31 that it's hard to imagine a scenario
7381.35 in which just talk therapy and fish oil
7383.45 and lifestyle interventions
are going to completely
7386.18 suppress or treat bipolar disorder.
7388.28 People with bipolar disorder
really need to consider
7390.86 the full picture of treatments,
the drug treatments,
7393.83 the
7395.27 talk therapy treatments,
and lifestyle treatments,
7398.18 and nutraceutical, or we can say
7401.33 supplement-based treatments
such as omega-3 supplementation
7404.81 as a full and necessary picture
7408.05 for dealing with their illness.
7409.88 I'd be remiss, however,
7411.5 if I didn't emphasize that
the omega-3 fatty acid
7414.02 supplementation
7415.58 is very interesting, not just in terms of
7418.4 the subjective effects,
7420.23 people saying they feel less depressed
7421.57 or able to sleep better, or
maybe even some reduction
7423.98 in manic symptoms,
7425.15 there's actually been some
really good brain imaging
7427.07 to try and understand how
omega-3 fatty acid treatments
7430.61 are actually changing the brains
7432.5 and neural circuits of
people with bipolar.
7434.06 And I will put a reference to this.
7435.32 This is a paper that was published
7436.82 in the American Journal Psychiatry.
7438.74 It's entitled, Omega-3
Fatty Acid Treatment
7440.96 and T2 Whole Brain Relaxation
Times in Bipolar Disorder.
7445.79 I don't have the opportunity
to go into a lot of detail
7448.16 right now about what T2 whole
brain relaxation times are,
7451.13 but basically when people go into a MRI
7453.89 or f, functional MRI scanner,
7458.6 excuse me,
7459.433 magnetic resonance imaging scanner,
7462.32 what they're getting essentially is pulses
7464.21 of magnetic fields and the
way that brain structures
7467.87 and neural activity can be evaluated
7469.4 has a lot to do with
7470.99 the sort of spinning, or not sort of,
7473.03 it has to do with the spinning
and the relaxation times
7476.03 of different elements,
7478.37 literally the protons and
electrons within the neurons,
7481.79 so it gets really detailed there,
7483.71 and the relaxation time
is essentially looking
7486.2 at how quickly some of that
spinning returns to rest.
7489.95 And in particular,
7492.38 the fact that the relaxation
times are different
7495.77 for aqueous, that is liquid,
7498.44 versus lipid, fatty versus other
components of brain tissue.
7503.06 And basically what this study shows
7505.1 is that the membranes of neurons
7507.68 within the brains of these people
7509.3 with bipolar disorder,
showed more fluidity,
7511.7 more ability of things to move
in and around the membranes,
7514.94 which we know is an important
component of neuroplasticity
7518.84 in bipolar subjects that were treated
7520.97 with omega-3 fatty acids as compared
7523.16 to bipolar subjects that did not receive
7525.77 omega-3 fatty acids.
7527.15 And fortunately this study also include
7529.49 a healthy comparison group where
they could essentially find
7532.88 that people with bipolar
disorder who supplemented
7535.4 with omega-3 had changes
at the cellular level
7538.58 and the neural circuit level
that brought their brains
7542.45 and neural circuits closer to that
7544.21 of the healthy comparison subjects.
7546.29 So while I don't want to
point to omega-3 fatty acid
7549.95 supplementation as the
be-all end-all of treatment
7552.17 for bipolar disorder, certainly it is not,
7554.24 it does have a strong
mechanistic basis for
7558.65 its possible support of neural circuitry,
7563.03 of neuroplasticity, and in particular,
7565.37 the ability to make
changes in cell membranes
7567.47 that are very reminiscent of some
7570.05 of the neural circuit changes
7571.31 and changes in membrane fluidity
7572.93 that are seen with lithium treatment
7574.7 and other known
prescription drug treatments
7577.31 that have been established now for decades
7580.22 to be very effective for bipolar disorder.
7582.95 So what that says is that
omega-3 supplementation,
7586.43 while not the only intervention
that one should consider
7590.0 is something to consider and
talk about with your doctor
7593.09 and it's operating in powerful ways.
7595.64 It's not just that it's
changing, for instance,
7598.22 your gut microbiome, which is powerful,
7600.32 but is indirect to the brain,
7601.52 it does seem to be having
direct effects on neurons
7603.8 and neural circuits.
7604.91 Before we begin to conclude our discussion
7606.53 about bipolar disorder,
7608.15 I want to talk a little bit
about this word, disorder,
7611.0 and this is a theme
that doesn't just relate
7612.89 to bipolar disorder,
7614.27 but other psychiatric disorders as well.
7616.667 And when we think of a disorder,
7618.71 we think of something that
is really detrimental to us.
7622.1 Something that really impairs
our ability to function
7625.04 in work, in school, in relationships,
7626.75 and really starts to pull
down our health status
7630.08 in a variety of ways.
7631.19 And certainly bipolar
disorder meets those criteria.
7634.94 However,
7636.59 there is this idea that
things like bipolar disorder,
7639.74 even things like
schizophrenia in some cases
7642.65 are responsible for some
of the creative aspects
7645.56 or the creative works
that have been observed
7647.84 and carried out by human
beings for many centuries.
7651.11 And believe it or not, there are good data
7653.18 to support the fact that
certain aspects of mania
7656.36 are associated with creativity.
7658.85 Now, we are long overdue for
an episode about creativity,
7662.24 its neural circuit
basis, its chemical basis
7664.19 here on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
7665.81 and certainly we will
have that conversation.
7668.24 But in the meantime, I'd like
to just briefly touch upon
7671.51 this idea that certain
occupations are associated
7674.9 with a higher incidence
of bipolar depression.
7677.84 And in fact,
7679.55 it's been explored at a research level.
7682.49 There are data pointed to the fact
7684.56 that certain individuals
of certain occupations
7687.8 tend to be more creative
and that creativity
7690.47 is associated with, again, associated,
7692.9 this isn't causal, it's
associated, correlated with
7695.78 higher levels or incidents
of bipolar depression
7699.05 and maybe even other forms of depression.
7701.09 So this is a study
looking at mood disorders
7704.24 in eminent individuals.
7705.83 So these are people that are
not just good at what they do,
7708.95 but are exceptional at what they do,
7710.93 and explored the percentage
of people in given professions
7715.64 with either depression or mania.
7719.0 And this was actually a data set gleaned
7721.4 from more than a thousand
20th Century Westerners
7725.12 based on their biographies that were
7727.76 reviewed by other people.
7729.02 So it's a bit of an indirect measurement.
7730.58 This isn't psychiatrist
data, this is data,
7733.79 or I should say these are data
7735.74 that were compiled from self reports
7739.34 or from reads of self reports.
7742.13 And they explored a number
of different professions.
7743.87 So for instance, they looked
at people in the military
7746.48 or people who were professional athletes
7748.43 or natural scientists
or social scientists,
7751.07 people who occupied
positions in public office,
7753.38 or were musical performers,
7755.72 artists, nonfiction
writers, poetry, et cetera.
7758.57 There are a lot of professions here.
7760.25 I will post this or I'll post a link to it
7762.71 in the show note captions
for you to peruse,
7764.99 but I'll just give you
a sense of the extremes
7767.15 on this graph because
they're very interesting.
7769.43 Turns out that if you were
to look at the profession
7772.128 or I should say among the
professions they looked at
7774.98 in this study, 'cause they
didn't look at all professions,
7778.22 those in the military and those
7780.62 who are professional athletes or had jobs
7783.11 in the social or natural
sciences, of those,
7787.73 there was a lower percentage of those
7789.68 that had depression or mania.
7791.83 In some cases like those who
were professional athletes
7793.91 didn't seem to have, there
was no incidence of mania,
7796.37 at least in this dataset,
7798.14 whereas at the opposite
extreme of the graph,
7800.57 those that were poets, so
these are eminent individuals,
7804.2 people that were exceptional poets,
7806.06 exceptional fiction writers,
7808.04 exceptional artists or
non-fiction writers,
7811.31 well there, especially for the poets,
7814.1 you find that as many as 90%
7818.14 of these very successful poets
7820.49 had either depression or mania.
7824.96 As high as 90%, that's incredible.
7827.21 Contrast that with military
where it's as few as 10%
7830.24 or professional athletes
where it's as few as 20%,
7832.277 and for the professional
athletes, as I mentioned before,
7834.56 none of them had mania.
7836.24 So does this mean that being a poet
7839.06 will make you manic or depressed?
7840.62 Well, first of all, let's
look at the poetry category.
7843.32 It turns out that 75%
of these eminent poets,
7847.91 these highly accomplished
poets had major depression,
7852.65 whereas only about 20% of
those poets had manic episodes.
7859.88 So again, it's not that being a poet
7862.67 is going to give you mania,
7863.6 certainly we're not saying that,
7864.59 it's not that being a poet is
going to give you depression,
7866.45 but it turns out that
people with depression
7869.63 and people with depression and mania
7872.24 seem to gravitate towards poetry
7874.16 or at least are very successful at poetry.
7877.28 Again, associative, correlative,
7879.98 no causal relationship here.
7882.47 But it is really striking to see
7884.36 how the creative
occupations, poetry, fiction,
7888.5 art, non-fiction writing,
7890.3 even though non-fiction
writing is about non-fiction,
7892.13 it's still creative, music
composition, theater,
7894.95 much higher incidents
of things like mania.
7897.71 In fact, for the people
in theater, the actors,
7901.01 even though the overall
7903.17 occurrence of depression
and mania is lower
7905.78 than that in poets, the fraction of those
7909.32 individuals that have
mania is exceedingly high.
7912.5 It's about 30% of those
that they looked at
7916.31 who are actors,
7918.53 have manic episodes or
have full blown mania.
7922.25 So I'm referring to these
data because first of all,
7924.86 I find them incredibly interesting,
7926.57 right up until now we've been talking
7927.68 about bipolar disorder
and other mood disorders
7930.26 for their maladaptive effects.
7931.7 And again, they're extremely maladaptive,
7933.35 much, much higher instance
of suicide, et cetera,
7936.47 but we'd be wrong to
say that certain aspects
7939.02 of manic episodes don't
lend themselves well
7940.82 to creativity or that certain aspects
7943.1 of major depression don't
lend themselves well
7945.68 to creativity or to the performing arts
7948.29 or to poetry.
7949.31 That said, in no way, shape or form,
7952.91 do I believe that being
depressed is a good thing
7956.27 or that being manic is a good thing.
7957.89 Again, we return to the
basic foundational criteria
7960.92 for bipolar disorder, major depression
7962.48 which is that the pressured
speech, the not sleeping,
7966.95 the incredible increases in energy
7969.86 and the flights of ideas
7971.75 are generally not going to lead,
7974.24 or I think it's fair to say,
7976.07 are not going to lead to good places.
7978.17 In fact, often lead to bad places.
7980.84 But we would also be wrong if
we didn't consider the fact
7984.14 that there is a somewhat
inextricable relationship
7987.74 between mania and creativity.
7990.08 And it could be that hypomania
7993.26 or brief periods of mania,
maybe even an hour a day
7996.5 or 30 minutes a day of
composing or writing poetry,
7999.53 maybe even some of the lows that we feel,
8001.96 some of the sadness, some of the grief,
8003.55 some of the nostalgia that we feel
8005.2 provided that it's not pathologic,
8007.24 that it's not persistent
for the four or seven days
8010.24 that are diagnostic of bipolar 2
8012.4 and bipolar 1 disorder respectively,
8014.47 well, then we can start
to view emotional states
8018.07 as something that can
actually lend themselves
8020.35 to positive outcomes and
maybe even to creativity
8023.47 and to improved occupations.
8025.21 So it's important that
we have a nuanced view
8027.55 of what sadness versus depression
8030.58 versus major depression are,
8032.35 it's important that we distinguish between
8035.23 being erratic, being very energized,
8038.68 and full blown bipolar disorder.
8040.75 And I raise this for
another reason as well.
8042.76 Nowadays, it's very common
8044.74 to hear people saying, ah, you know,
8046.48 that person is OCD.
8047.59 Well, on the episode about OCD
that I did a few weeks back,
8051.94 that you can find if you
like at hubermanlab.com,
8055.12 in that episode, I pointed out that OCD,
8058.72 obsessive-compulsive
disorder is very maladaptive.
8061.81 I think it's number seven, as I recall
8063.88 on the list of debilitating diseases,
8066.1 all diseases in terms
of lost time at work,
8069.16 suffering relationships, et cetera.
8070.84 So it's a really serious condition.
8072.55 And yet we often hear, oh,
that person is obsessive.
8075.04 And as I pointed out,
8076.33 there is obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
8078.79 And then there is
obsessive-compulsive tendencies,
8081.52 which actually benefit people,
8083.26 but that is distinct from
obsessive-compulsive disorder
8086.71 as a clinically diagnosed thing.
8089.44 Similarly, we hear that, oh,
somebody's being bipolar.
8093.1 You know, they're all over the place.
8094.18 They're bipolar.
8095.11 Well, that's a very subjective
8098.5 label that people give
one another in passing,
8101.83 more and more often I'm hearing this,
8103.21 and yet bipolar disorder,
8105.94 whether or not it's BP-1 or BP-2
8108.01 are extremely maladaptive
and extremely associated
8112.45 with high suicide risk.
8114.37 So while I'm not here to police people,
8117.46 I'm not certainly not the word police
8118.72 or the nomenclature police,
8120.28 I do think that whether or
not you refer to people as OCD
8123.16 or as bipolar, et
cetera, that's up to you,
8125.26 it's not my place to say,
8126.46 but I do think it's important
that all of us understand
8129.01 that these psychiatric
conditions carry with them
8131.59 tremendous maladaptive weight.
8133.84 So today we've really done a deep dive
8135.94 into bipolar disorder
and to both the manic
8139.42 and the depressive components
8140.8 that are present or can be present
8143.89 in bipolar disorder
and the different forms
8145.84 of bipolar disorder and
8147.85 some of the major treatments
for bipolar disorder,
8149.8 in particular lithium and
its underlying mechanisms
8152.2 and some of the neural
circuit and chemical basis
8154.54 and neuroplasticity
basis of the treatments
8157.6 for bipolar disorder, in
particular homeostatic scaling
8161.65 or homeostatic plasticity.
8163.78 All of that, of course, is
relevant to bipolar disorder
8166.6 and I hope will be useful
in your understanding
8168.73 and maybe even in your
pursuit of treatments
8170.38 for bipolar depression,
bipolar disorder for you
8172.98 or other people.
8174.25 I also hope that it will be
useful in your understanding
8176.98 of how brain circuits work
8178.81 in normal conditions or in conditions
8180.55 where there is no disease state
or maladaptive conditions.
8183.82 Homeostatic plasticity
is present in all of us.
8187.45 Membrane fluidity due to how
easily things move around
8191.14 in the surface, the fatty
layers on the outside of neurons
8193.93 and the movement of receptors
in and out of neurons
8195.91 that is present in all of us.
8197.56 The influence of omega-3 fatty acids
8199.69 is central to that discussion.
8201.97 As is the discussion about
various drug treatments
8204.61 because even if you're
not somebody who's taking
8206.14 a drug treatment or who is
pursuing a drug treatment
8208.9 for bipolar disorder or
another psychiatric condition,
8211.72 your serotonin levels,
your dopamine levels,
8213.73 your acetylcholine
levels, all of these play
8215.47 into what we call your
mental and physical health.
8217.78 In fact, if any of you are interested
8219.19 in the various categories
of neuromodulators
8221.56 and tools to adjust those neuromodulators
8224.02 under more standard
non-disease conditions,
8226.87 we did an episode
8228.67 on neurochemicals and how to control them.
8230.89 You can find that at hubermanlab.com
8232.84 along with all other episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
8235.42 I should mention everything is timestamped
8237.31 So you can navigate to the specific topics
8238.93 and tools of interest to you.
8240.7 And meanwhile, I just
want to thank all of you
8243.4 for joining me on this voyage
8246.01 through the biology and the
treatments for bipolar disorder.
8249.16 I do hope you found it beneficial
8251.44 both for yourself and for others.
8253.36 I just want to remind
people that bipolar disorder
8255.33 is an extremely serious condition.
8257.53 If you suspect that you
have bipolar disorder
8259.66 or you know somebody who does,
8261.85 please make sure that you or they talk
8263.83 to a qualified health professional.

8298.84 During today's episode, and certainly
8300.34 on many previous episodes
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
8302.89 we talk about supplements.
8304.24 Once again, while
supplements aren't necessary
8306.16 for everybody, many people derive
8307.72 tremendous benefit from them for things
8309.16 like enhancing sleep and
focus and hormone support
8311.74 and other aspects of
mental and physical health
8313.87 and performance.
8315.13 As I mentioned at the
beginning of today's episode,
8316.87 the Huberman Lab Podcast
is happy to announce
8318.73 that we partnered with
Momentous Supplements.
8320.71 If you'd like to see our supplements
8322.09 and the ones that we designed
in concert with Momentous,
8324.34 you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.
8327.79 Please also check out
Huberman Lab on social media.
8330.46 We are hubermanlab on both
Twitter and Instagram.
8333.43 In both places, I cover science
and science-related tools,
8336.19 some of which overlaps with the content
8337.75 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
8339.22 but much of which is distinct
8340.51 from the information covered
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
8343.12 We also have a newsletter,
8344.44 it's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
8346.57 It's completely zero cost
8347.83 and it contains summaries of podcasts
8350.11 and some actionable
protocols from each podcast.
8352.24 You can sign up for it by
going to hubermanlab.com,
8354.52 go to the menu and click on
Neural Network Newsletter.
8357.43 You can also see some examples
8358.66 of previous newsletters there.
8360.22 I should mention that by signing up,
8361.96 you do provide your email,
8363.22 but we do not share
your email with anybody.
8365.14 And again, it is completely zero cost.
8367.3 So once again, thank
you for joining me today
8368.98 for our discussion about the biology
8370.69 and treatment of bipolar disorder.
8372.19 And last, but certainly not least,
8374.53 thank you for your interest in science.
