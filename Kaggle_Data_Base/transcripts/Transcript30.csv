0.42,"- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast, "
1.9,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.89,for everyday life. 
6.096,[bright music] 
9.15,I'm Andrew Huberman 
10.17,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
13.17,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
15.06,Today we're talking all about sleep 
17.01,and how to optimize your sleep. 
19.32,This is a topic we've covered previously on this podcast 
22.23,"in the episode called ""Master Your Sleep."" "
24.69,"However, since the airing of that episode, "
27.03,there's been some terrific new science to come out. 
29.52,"I've also received thousands, "
31.14,"yes, literally thousands of questions "
33.33,related to the specific protocols covered in that episode 
36.48,as well as in the episode on jet lag and shift work. 
39.9,And while today's episode 
40.89,"is not specifically about jet lag and shift work, "
43.44,we are going to cover tools 
44.76,that will allow you to shift your schedule 
46.89,"if you need to for work or travel, "
49.14,and we will also cover tools 
51.3,that will allow you to fall back asleep 
53.16,if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night 
55.2,"or if you get a poor night's sleep, "
56.61,how to actually recover 
57.54,"from that poor night's sleep more quickly, "
59.76,"and yes, indeed, even replace sleep that you've lost. "
63.06,So today's episode is going to be filled 
65.4,with practical tools. 
66.54,"We will touch on some of the underlying science, "
68.79,but it's really designed to be a practical toolkit 
71.43,for optimizing your sleep 
73.02,depending on your specific sleep needs. 
75.12,"Various times throughout today's episode, "
77.07,I will refer to studies that form the backbone of the tools 
80.1,that I'll be describing. 
81.42,But whereas most of the podcast episodes here 
84.48,"tend to be deep scientific mechanism and then tools, "
87.57,"scientific mechanism, then tools, "
88.86,today I'm mainly going to focus on the practical tools 
92.22,"that anyone, indeed, all people, I believe, should use "
95.16,in order to optimize their sleep. 
96.87,Why should everybody want to optimize their sleep 
99.24,and put considerable effort into optimizing their sleep? 
102.48,"Well, put simply, sleep is the foundation "
105.3,"of mental health, physical health, "
107.19,"and performance of all kinds, "
108.45,"cognitive performance, physical performance, et cetera. "
110.97,"It also controls things like our immune system, "
113.7,"wound healing, our skin health and our appearance, "
117.33,"whether or not we can think clearly or not, "
119.79,whether or not we will live as long 
121.74,"as we possibly can or not, "
123.9,whether or not we suffer 
125.22,from dramatic age-related cognitive decline or not. 
128.88,"In other words, whether or not we keep our memory as we age. "
131.91,I could go on and on 
132.78,about all the terrible things that can happen to somebody 
135.66,if they don't sleep well. 
137.55,Thanks to the great work of Professor Matt Walker 
140.61,"at University of California, Berkeley, "
142.11,"and the wonderful book that he wrote, ""Why We Sleep,"" "
144.72,I think the world is largely onboard now 
147.0,"that sleep is critical to our health, "
149.28,"our mental health, our physical health, and our performance, "
151.98,"but what's not often discussed is how great life is, "
155.79,"that is, how much more focused and energetic "
158.04,"and how positive our mood gets, "
159.84,when we are sleeping for the appropriate amount of time 
162.72,at the appropriate depth 
164.34,and when we are doing that regularly. 
166.26,Basically everything in life gets better 
167.94,when we're sleeping well. 
168.78,So today I'm going to teach you the tools 
170.73,that will allow you to optimize your sleep. 
173.28,"That is, get to sleep and stay asleep, "
175.68,"fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night, "
178.35,and adjust your sleep 
179.46,given the various life demands you may be experiencing. 
182.16,I'm pleased to announce that The Huberman Lab Podcast 
184.05,is now partnered with Momentous supplements. 
186.36,We partnered with Momentous for several important reasons. 
188.61,"First of all, they ship internationally, "
190.29,because we know that many of you are located 
192.21,outside of the United States. 
193.98,That's valuable. 
195.06,"Second of all, and perhaps most important, "
197.07,"the quality of their supplements is second to none, "
199.62,both in terms of purity 
200.67,and precision of the amounts of the ingredients. 
203.25,"Third, we've really emphasized supplements "
205.89,that are single-ingredient supplements 
207.93,and that are supplied in dosages 
210.15,that allow you to build a supplementation protocol 
213.12,"that's optimized for cost, "
214.95,"that's optimized for effectiveness, "
216.81,and that you can add things 
218.34,and remove things from your protocol 
219.96,in a way that's really systematic and scientific. 
222.0,This is really hard to do 
223.35,if you're taking blends of different supplements 
225.21,"or if the dosages are such that you can't titrate, "
227.78,"or that is, adjust the dosages of a given supplement. "
231.33,"So by using single-ingredient supplements, "
233.97,you can really build out the supplement kit 
235.62,that's ideal for you and your specific needs. 
238.74,If you'd like to see the supplements 
239.91,"that we partner with Momentous on, "
241.23,you can go to livemomentous.com/huberman. 
244.32,There you'll see those supplements. 
245.46,And just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding 
247.95,the library of supplements available through Momentous 
250.62,on a regular basis. 
251.58,"Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman. "
254.25,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize "
256.11,that this podcast is separate 
257.46,from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
259.65,"It is, however, part of my desire and effort "
261.72,to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information 
263.55,about science and science-related tools 
265.38,to the general public. 
266.76,"In keeping with that theme, "
267.81,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
270.6,Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. 
272.94,InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
275.37,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
278.01,to help you better meet your health goals. 
280.38,I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done 
282.81,for the simple reason that many of the factors 
285.21,that impact your immediate and long-term health 
287.25,can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. 
289.62,"And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA test, "
292.17,you can also get insight 
293.25,"into, for instance, what your biological age is "
295.44,and compare that to your chronological age. 
297.36,"And, of course, your biological age "
299.1,is really the age that counts. 
301.35,The problem with a lot of blood tests 
302.46,"and DNA tests out there, however, "
304.23,is that you get information back 
305.79,"about the levels of metabolic factors, "
307.35,"lipids, hormones, et cetera, "
308.94,but you don't know what to do with that information. 
310.77,InsideTracker makes that all very easy to navigate. 
313.32,They have a personalized platform. 
315.12,"So this is a web portal where you can go, "
317.52,"you'll see the numbers from your blood tests and DNA tests, "
320.01,"and then it will tell you, for instance, "
321.42,how you could adjust various aspects of your nutrition 
323.76,or your exercise or supplementation 
325.71,in order to bring those numbers 
327.18,into the ranges that are best for you. 
329.4,"If you'd like to try InsideTracker, "
330.78,you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman 
333.63,to get 
20%,off any of InsideTracker's plans. 
336.15,That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 
20%,off. 
340.11,Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. 
342.34,Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers 
344.19,"with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capabilities. "
347.37,It turns out that your body temperature 
349.77,and your ability to fall and stay asleep 
351.72,are very closely related. 
353.79,"If your body does not drop by one to three degrees, "
356.67,you are simply not going to get into deep sleep 
358.59,or stay in deep sleep. 
360.15,"And waking up, it also turns out, "
362.49,is related to body temperature. 
363.81,"Every time you wake up in the morning, "
365.46,"your body is warming up in order to wake you up, "
368.01,and this has an enormous number of hormonal and metabolic 
370.59,"and other cascades that are vitally important, "
372.42,"not just to what happens while you sleep, "
374.28,but your health and your energy 
375.627,and focus throughout the day. 
377.64,Eight Sleep is an incredible device. 
379.65,"It's one that I've been using for six months or so, "
382.41,and it's completely transformed my sleep. 
383.847,And I already thought I was sleeping pretty well. 
386.37,The way it works is that you can cool or heat your mattress 
389.58,according to different times throughout the night. 
392.49,"So for instance, you can cool your mattress "
394.14,if you tend to run warm 
395.46,and that will help you fall and stay deeply asleep 
397.5,"and then toward morning, "
398.58,you can have the mattress programmed 
400.44,"or, I should say, the mattress cover programmed, "
402.36,so that you warm up your sleeping environment 
404.55,and you wake up when you want to wake up. 
406.68,If you've been sleeping pretty well 
408.24,"but waking up in the middle of the night, "
409.47,you might also find 
410.46,that by cooling your mattress even further 
412.53,"toward the middle of your sleep about, "
414.24,"well, you'll stay in deep sleep much longer. "
417.06,"If you'd like to try Eight Sleep, "

432.93,Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. 
435.54,LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need 
438.21,"in order to get your brain and body to function at its best, "
441.0,"but none of the things you don't, "
442.14,"in particular, sugar. "
443.82,Electrolytes are vitally important 
445.41,"to the way that your neurons, your nerve cells, work "
447.66,"and, indeed, to the way "
448.62,that all the cells of your body work. 
450.6,But your nervous system and your neurons 
452.04,particularly depend on electrolytes 
454.32,"because you need the electrolytes, "
456.21,"sodium, magnesium, and potassium, "
458.16,"in the proper ratios, "
459.12,in order for those nerve cells 
460.41,"to fire what are called action potentials, "
462.27,which are the electrical signals 
463.92,that allow your neurons to work 
465.18,and to allow you to do everything 
466.44,from remembering information 
467.88,to moving your muscles deliberately. 
470.49,"When you exercise, or even if you don't, "
472.95,"you can get quite low on electrolytes, "
474.75,especially on a hot day. 
475.77,You can get dehydrated. 
477.12,There are lot of different ways 
478.65,to replenish your fluids and electrolytes 
480.81,and there are a lot of different 
481.643,"electrolyte drinks out there, "
483.09,but many of them contain a lot of sugar. 
485.1,And some of those that don't contain a lot of sugar 
487.74,don't have the proper ratios 
489.09,"of sodium, magnesium, and potassium. "
490.83,"If you'd like to try LMNT, "
491.91,"you can go to drinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T, .com/huberman "
496.17,to claim a free LMNT Sample Pack 
498.12,with your first purchase. 
499.23,"Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman "
502.17,to claim a free sample pack. 
504.06,Let's talk about sleep and tools to optimize your sleep. 
508.53,I want you to conceptualize yourself 
511.38,as contained within a room 
514.35,that has only very few windows or very few entry points. 
519.33,What do I mean by this? 
520.163,"Well, your brain and your nervous system control "
524.07,whether or not you move or don't move. 
525.93,They control whether or not you're digesting food 
527.82,or you're not digesting food. 
529.89,"They control whether or not you're stressed or not stressed, "
531.69,"happy or sad, et cetera. "
533.55,All of that stuff that controls all that stuff 
537.03,"is housed inside your skin and skull, et cetera. "
540.78,"That might seem pretty obvious, "
542.52,but what that means is that for your brain and body 
546.48,"to feel alert and focused, "
549.66,"ready to move and exercise or do some work, "
552.96,"or if your brain body are going to lie down and go to sleep, "
557.31,"well, that brain and body needs cues, it needs inputs, "
562.29,to determine when to do those different things. 
565.77,And those cues and inputs arrive 
568.17,"through a defined set of what I'll call stimuli, "
571.08,but you can also think of these as levers or tools. 
573.869,The main levers and tools that are going to allow you 
577.26,to control when you are awake and when you are asleep 
580.59,and to get better sleep every single night 
583.53,"are light, literally photons, light energy, "
588.06,"could be from sunlight, could be from artificial light, "
589.98,"we will discuss those particulars in a moment, "
592.92,as well as darkness. 
595.11,That is the absence of light. 
597.84,So we've got light and dark. 
599.34,Those are two very powerful tools 
602.22,to encourage your nervous system 
603.6,"to be in one state or another, "
605.13,meaning awake or asleep. 
607.38,Temperature is another tool or lever. 
611.04,"Turns out that when your body is cooling down, "
614.25,you have a greater tendency to fall and stay asleep. 
618.09,"In fact, every night when you actually sleep, "
621.15,your body is dropping by one to three degrees 
623.52,and that drop in temperature is required. 
626.58,It's like a gate that your body has to go through 
629.13,in order for you to get into sleep. 
631.74,"And in fact, the converse is also true. "
633.69,"If your body heats up by one to three degrees or so, "
637.05,you will wake up. 
638.46,"So you've got light, dark, temperature, food. "
643.47,"And when we say food, "
645.21,"we mean what we eat, when we eat, "
648.81,and the amount that we eat. 
651.12,"Okay, so light, dark, temperature, food, exercise. "
654.36,"And of course, exercise comes in different forms. "
656.7,We can do cardiovascular exercise 
658.35,"that can be low-intensity, long-distance exercise. "
661.89,"It can be high intensity, "
663.45,so-called high intensity interval training. 
665.46,It could be weight training. It could be yoga. 
667.56,"It could be swimming, any number of different activities. "
669.87,"But exercise, in general, causes "
672.27,an increase in body temperature 
674.76,"and tends to make us more alert, "
677.28,"not just during the exercise, "
678.81,but in the immediate hours after that exercise. 
681.87,Exercise does some other things 
683.16,that relate to our sleep as well 
684.39,and we'll talk about those today 
685.68,and how you can leverage them. 
687.09,Another potent lever 
688.68,for adjusting your sleepiness and wakefulness is caffeine. 
693.96,"This, of course, comes as no surprise to people, "
696.36,but why and how caffeine works might come as a surprise. 
700.8,"Very briefly, we have a molecule "
703.83,in our body called adenosine 
705.39,"and the longer we have been awake, "
707.49,the more adenosine builds up in our brain and body 
709.8,and adenosine is part of the reason why we get sleepy. 
712.74,Caffeine effectively operates as a adenosine antagonist. 
718.17,It works by basically occupying the receptor for adenosine. 
721.56,So it's a little bit of a convoluted mechanism. 
723.84,But basically all you need to know 
725.55,is that caffeine prevents the actions of adenosine. 
728.67,That's one of the reasons why caffeine makes us feel alert. 
731.52,But how much caffeine we drink 
732.9,and when we drink caffeine turns out to be vitally important 
735.39,for adjusting our wakefulness 
737.49,and for optimizing our sleep. 
738.81,So we'll talk about that as well. 
740.1,The other category of lever or tools 
741.81,which are immensely powerful for optimizing sleep 
744.99,are supplements. 
746.79,There now exist as many as eight different supplements 
749.91,that can powerfully modulate sleep in healthy ways 
753.39,and that have huge margins for safety. 
755.85,So we're going to talk about what those supplements are. 
758.34,In previous episodes of this podcast 
760.17,"and as a guest on other podcasts, "
762.45,"I've talked about three particular supplements, "
764.43,"magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine, "
768.54,which together can really enhance 
770.22,the speed at which one falls asleep 
772.29,and people's ability to stay asleep 
774.36,and to really get into those deep stages of sleep 
776.373,that are particularly restorative. 
778.2,Today we're going to talk a little bit more 
779.82,about each of those three 
780.87,"and how they can best be used in combination, "
783.24,but we are also going to touch on some other supplements 
785.88,"that I have not talked about much before, if at all. "
789.15,"Things like glycine and GABA, as well as inositol. "
793.17,Many people are going to find inositol interesting 
795.69,"and of particular use to them, "
798.18,especially if they're following a low-carbohydrate diet 
800.88,or if they are fasting before sleep 
803.48,or just trying to avoid eating too close to bedtime 
806.43,and yet they're having a hard time falling asleep. 
809.19,Inositol also turns out to be especially useful 
811.56,for people who have a tendency 
812.61,to wake up in the middle of the night 
814.47,and have a hard time falling back asleep. 
816.2,It also has some interesting and potent effects 
818.85,on anxiety throughout the day. 
820.2,So we're going to talk about inositol as a tool as well. 
823.59,And then last in our list of general categories 
825.72,of levers and tools for optimizing sleep 
828.36,are digital tools. 
829.327,"Now, when we say digital tools, "
831.27,I don't necessarily mean devices. 
832.71,What I mean are things like non-sleep deep rest scripts. 
836.22,These are zero-cost scripts that you listen to 
839.22,that take your body through some deep relaxation 
841.35,"and that can help people both fall asleep, stay asleep, "
845.01,"fall back asleep, and get better at sleeping. "
847.89,And also going to talk about digital tools 
850.38,related to self-hypnosis. 
851.82,This is distinctly different from stage hypnosis. 
854.22,"So I know some of you hear hypnosis and you think, "
856.08,"oh, you know, people clucking like chickens "
858.96,and doing things that are outside their control. 
861.03,That's not at all what I'm referring to here. 
862.65,I'm talking about clinically and research-supported tools 
866.67,that have been shown to enhance people's ability 
869.55,to fall and stay asleep 
870.78,and that can get you far better at sleeping. 
874.17,"So again, to recap the list of levers and tools, "
876.93,"we've got light and dark, "
878.787,"and that includes the intensity of light, "
880.53,"the timing of light, et cetera. "
881.7,We've got temperature. 
882.9,We have food. 
884.01,"We have exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools, "
889.11,"not just limited to devices, "
890.7,but zero-cost tools that you can access on YouTube 
894.21,and elsewhere in various apps 
895.83,that can really help you optimize your sleep. 
897.63,So today we're going to talk about all of these. 
899.25,"I really want to provide you as many tools as possible, "
901.71,give you the logic behind each of those tools 
903.45,and when and how best to apply them 
905.64,so that you can develop the sleep toolkit 
908.52,that's ideal for your sleep needs. 
910.65,As we head into our description 
912.24,"of tools for optimizing sleep, "
914.55,let's consider what the perfect 
24-hour,cycle 
918.39,would look like. 
919.92,Let's start this 
24-hour,cycle 
921.57,with when you wake up in the morning. 
923.34,"So for some of you, that will be "
5:,
00,a.m. 
925.35,"For others of you, that will be "
10:,
00,a.m. 
927.36,"Most people, I believe, wake up "
928.62,sometime between 
6:,
30,a.m. and 
8:,
30,a.m. 
932.7,"But regardless of when you wake up in the morning, "
935.31,one of the first things that happens 
936.93,is that your body temperature is increasing 
939.78,and that's just going to happen naturally. 
941.79,Some of it is going to be the consequence 
943.41,"of your moving around a bit, "
945.0,but really the increase in body temperature 
947.46,is one of the main triggers 
949.05,for why you woke up in the first place. 
952.2,That increase in body temperature in turn causes an increase 
956.25,in the release of a hormone called cortisol. 
958.98,"Cortisol is often discussed as a stress hormone, "
961.89,but it's not just associated with stress. 
963.9,It also enhances your immune system 
966.51,"provided cortisol is elevated at the right times, "
969.78,and the right time for cortisol to be elevated 
971.7,is when you first wake up in the morning. 
974.82,That increase in cortisol 
975.96,is also going to increase metabolism. 
978.93,It's also going to increase your ability to focus mentally 
982.5,and for you to move your body. 
984.75,"So again, cortisol is often demonized "
987.87,and consider this bad thing. 
989.13,"And indeed, you don't want cortisol "
990.75,to be chronically or consistently elevated 
993.21,throughout the day or night. 
994.71,But you do want cortisol to reach its peak early in the day 
998.4,right about the time you wake up. 
1000.86,One way that you can ensure 
1002.51,that that cortisol peak occurs early in the day 
1005.03,right about the time that you wake up 
1007.1,"is to view bright light, ideally from sunlight, "
1010.79,within the first 
30,to 
60,minutes after waking. 
1015.26,"That's right, view bright sunlight "
1017.81,within the first 
30,to 
60,minutes after waking. 
1021.86,I'll get into all the caveats 
1023.27,"about what happens if you wake up before the sun is out, "
1025.52,"what if you live in the UK where there is no sun, "
1027.44,or people claim there is no sun. 
1028.61,"Hate to tell you this, folks, but there is sun in the UK. "
1031.782,We'll talk about all that. 
1033.29,"But everybody, whether or not you live in a cloudy place "
1037.28,"or a sunny place, "
1038.39,"whether or not there's cloud cover or not that day, "
1040.97,"should really strive to get bright light in your eyes, "
1044.09,"ideally from sunlight, "
1045.5,within the first 
30,to 
60,minutes after waking. 
1049.16,The reason for that is very simple. 
1051.59,You want to trigger that cortisol increase 
1053.66,"to occur very early in your day, "
1057.05,"and you don't want that cortisol peak to happen later, "
1059.54,which is what will happen 
1060.74,if you wait to get outside and see sunlight. 
1064.85,The reason for this 
1065.99,"is that you have a set of neurons, nerve cells, in your eye. "
1069.35,They're called intrinsically photosensitive 
1070.91,"melanopsin cells, "
1071.743,but you do not need to know that name. 
1073.55,"Those neurons respond best to bright light, "
1076.43,"and especially right after waking early in the day, "
1079.73,they are best able to signal to a set of neurons 
1082.76,that reside over the roof of your mouth 
1084.71,"called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, "
1086.18,which is a cluster of neurons 
1087.17,"that then sends a huge number of other signals, "
1090.05,"electrical and chemical, "
1091.04,out to your entire body 
1092.54,"that triggers that cortisol increase, "
1094.97,"provides a wake-up signal for your brain and body, "
1096.98,and sets in motion a timer 
1099.32,for you to fall asleep later that night. 
1101.45,"So again, we're not trying to go into "
1102.92,too much mechanism today. 
1104.0,We are trying to really hammer on tools 
1105.83,and I'll substantiate those tools 
1107.69,just a bit with some mechanism. 
1109.55,"But here's what you do, or at least here's what I do. "
1111.89,"I wake up in the morning and I want to reach for my phone, "
1114.896,but I know that even if I were to crank up the brightness 
1117.59,"on that phone screen, "
1118.82,it's not bright enough to trigger that cortisol spike 
1122.12,and for me to be at my most alert and focused 
1125.93,throughout the day 
1126.763,and to optimize my sleep at night. 
1128.0,So what I do is I get out of bed and I go outside. 
1131.87,"And if it's a bright, clear day "
1135.2,and the sun is low in the sky 
1137.03,"or the sun is, you know, starting to get overhead, "
1139.04,"what we call low solar angle, "
1140.57,then I know I'm getting outside at the right time. 
1145.13,"If there's cloud cover and I can't see the sun, "
1148.16,I also know I'm doing a good thing 
1149.75,"because it turns out, especially on cloudy days, "
1151.94,you want to get outside 
1152.78,and get as much light energy or photons in your eyes. 
1155.78,But let's say it's a very clear day 
1157.67,and I can see where the sun is. 
1159.83,I do not need to stare directly into the sun. 
1162.59,"If it's very low in the sky, I might do that "
1165.59,because it's not going to be very painful to my eyes. 
1167.9,"However, if the sun is a little bit brighter "
1170.043,"and a little bit higher in the sky, "
1171.89,sometimes it could be painful to look at. 
1173.57,So the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day 
1177.29,is to look toward the sun. 
1179.99,"If it's too bright to look at directly, "
1182.33,"well, then don't do that. "
1183.29,"You just look toward it, but not directly at it. "
1185.57,It's absolutely fine to blink. 
1187.73,"In fact, I encourage you to blink "
1189.02,whenever you feel the impulse to blink. 
1191.45,"Never look at any light, sunlight or otherwise, "
1194.24,that's so bright that it's painful to look at 
1195.86,'cause you can damage your eyes. 
1197.51,"But for this morning sunlight viewing, "
1199.85,"it's best to not wear sunglasses, "
1201.89,"that's right, to not wear sunglasses, "
1204.26,at least for this morning sunlight viewing. 
1206.99,"It is absolutely fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses, "
1211.64,so-called corrective lenses. 
1212.75,"In fact, those will serve you well "
1214.85,in this practice or this tool 
1216.44,because they will focus the light onto your neural retina 
1218.6,and onto those melanopsin 
1219.59,intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells. 
1221.75,If your eyeglasses or contact lenses 
1224.0,"have UV protection, that's okay. "
1227.3,There's so many different wavelengths of light 
1228.74,coming from the sun 
1230.33,and they are bright enough 
1231.41,that they will trigger the mechanisms 
1233.12,that you want triggered at this early time of day. 
1236.9,"So try and get outside, "
1238.58,ideally within the first five minutes of waking 
1240.44,or maybe it's 
15,"minutes, "
1242.24,but certainly within the first hour after waking. 
1244.79,I want to share with you three critical things 
1246.95,about this tool of morning sunlight viewing. 
1249.26,"First of all, this is not some woo biology thing. "
1253.04,This is grounded in the core of our physiology. 
1255.98,"There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, "
1258.11,of quality peer-reviewed papers 
1259.55,showing that light viewing early in the day 
1263.03,is the most powerful stimulus 
1264.74,for wakefulness throughout the day 
1266.24,"and it has a powerful, positive impact "
1268.85,on your ability to fall and stay asleep at night. 
1270.95,So this is really the foundational power tool 
1273.92,for ensuring a great night's sleep 
1276.53,and for feeling more awake during the day. 
1279.08,"Second of all, if you wake up before the sun is out, "
1284.57,"you can, and probably should, flip on artificial lights "
1288.35,in your internal home environment or apartment 
1290.75,or wherever you happen to live 
1292.13,"if your goal is to be awake, right? "
1294.02,If you wake up at four in the morning 
1295.1,"and you need to be awake, "
1296.0,"well, then turn on artificial lights. "
1298.49,"Once the sun is out, however, "
1300.41,"once the sun has risen, "
1302.6,then you still want to get outside and view sunlight. 
1306.26,Some of you will wake up before the sun comes out. 
1309.26,And if you're asking whether or not 
1311.54,turning on artificial lights 
1312.71,"can replace sunlight at those hours, "
1314.78,"unfortunately, the answer is no. "
1317.87,"Unless you have a very special light, "
1319.217,"and we'll talk about what kind of light, "
1321.29,the bright artificial lights in your home environment 
1324.32,"are not, I repeat, are not going to be sufficiently bright "
1328.19,to turn on the cortisol mechanism 
1331.19,and the other wake-up mechanisms 
1332.72,that you need early in the day. 
1335.03,"The diabolical twist, however, "
1336.65,is that those lights in your home or apartment 
1339.41,or even on your phone 
1341.03,are bright enough to disrupt your sleep 
1343.58,if you look at them too late at night 
1345.31,or in the middle of the night. 
1346.7,"So there's this asymmetry in our retinal, our eye biology, "
1350.9,"and in our brain's biology, "
1352.58,"whereby early in the day, right around waking, "
1354.59,"you need a lot of light, a lot of photons, "
1357.05,"a lot of light energy, "
1358.19,and artificial lights generally just won't accomplish 
1361.4,what you need them to accomplish. 
1362.93,"But at night, even a little bit of artificial light "
1365.99,"can really mess up your so-called circadian, "
1368.45,your 
24-hour,"clocks, "
1369.83,and all these mechanisms that we're talking about. 
1371.9,"So if you wake up before the sun is out and it's still dark, "
1375.02,please turn on as many bright artificial lights 
1377.66,"as you possibly can or need, "
1379.76,but then get outside once the sun is out. 
1382.91,"On cloudy days, you especially need to get outside. "
1386.45,"I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days, "
1388.7,you especially need to get outside and get sunlight. 
1390.77,You just need to get more of it. 
1392.21,"Now, how much light and how much light viewing do you need? "
1395.48,"This is going to vary depending on person and place, "
1398.69,"literally where you live on earth, "
1400.34,"whether or not there's a lot of tree cover, "
1402.41,whether or not you're somebody who has sensitive eyes 
1404.21,or less sensitive eyes. 
1405.47,It's really impossible for me 
1406.7,"to give an absolute prescriptive, "
1408.53,but we can give some general guidelines. 
1410.24,"In general, on a clear day, "
1412.22,"meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover, "
1415.07,you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes 
1419.0,for about five minutes or so. 
1421.64,"Could be three minutes one day, "
1422.72,"could be seven minutes the next day, "
1424.61,about five minutes. 
1426.29,"On a day where there's cloud cover, "
1428.6,so the sun is just peeking through the clouds 
1430.4,"or it's more dense cloud cover, "
1432.68,you want to get about 
10,minutes of sunlight exposure 
1436.22,to your eyes early in the day. 
1437.66,And on days that are really densely overcast 
1440.15,"or maybe even are rainy, "
1441.44,you're going to want to get as much as 
20,or 
30,minutes 
1444.62,of sunlight exposure. 
1446.66,"Another key thing is do not, forget about, "
1450.26,just don't try and get this sunlight exposure 
1453.02,"through a windshield of a car or a window, "
1455.99,whether or not it's tinted or otherwise. 
1457.4,It takes far too long. 
1458.99,It's simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms. 
1462.08,You would be standing there all day 
1463.4,trying to get enough light into your eyes 
1465.14,from the morning sunlight 
1466.07,and by then the sun will have already moved 
1468.26,from low solar angle to overhead 
1470.27,and it simply won't work for all sorts of mechanisms 
1472.4,related to your circadian rhythm functions. 
1474.53,So just don't try and do it 
1475.58,"through a windshield, sunglasses, or a window. "
1480.05,It's just not going to work. 
1480.98,Get outside. 
1482.0,If the weather is really bad 
1483.38,"or for whatever reason, safety reasons, "
1484.91,"you cannot get outside, "
1486.02,"well, then I suppose try and get near a window. "
1487.85,"That would be the last, last resort. "
1489.89,But you really want to get outside 
1491.84,to get this sunlight exposure. 
1493.73,"Now, if you live in a part of the world "
1495.83,where it's extremely dark and overcast 
1497.93,or the weather won't let you outside 
1499.4,or you live in a cave or some other small box 
1502.67,that does not allow any natural light into it 
1505.07,"for whatever reason, "
1506.39,"well, then you're going to need a replacement "
1509.03,for that sunlight. 
1510.68,And there are sunlight simulators or daylight simulators 
1514.04,that you can purchase. 
1515.09,Those are quite expensive in general 
1517.94,and therefore I suggest cheaper options 
1521.06,that work just as well 
1522.56,because they get just as bright. 
1524.06,Things like ring lights that are sold 
1526.58,in order for people to take selfies and this kind of thing. 
1530.39,A drawing LED tablet will work pretty well. 
1533.3,I actually have one of those 
1534.133,and I put it on my desk all morning 
1535.55,even though I still get outside and look at sunlight 
1538.61,"first thing in the morning, "
1539.57,"again, also, especially, I should say, on cloudy days. "
1543.59,We do not have any affiliation 
1545.24,to any ring lights or LED lights or these panels. 
1549.02,So we will provide a link to a couple of different options 
1551.69,if you want to explore the various options. 
1553.22,I don't know what people's different budgets are. 
1554.75,I don't know where people live. 
1556.4,I just know that many of our listeners live 
1558.11,in locations throughout the world 
1559.25,"where, for instance, during the winter, "
1560.45,"it gets very, very dark, "
1561.47,so they can't get sufficient sunlight. 
1563.27,"But get that morning light, ideally from sunlight, "
1567.23,and take into account all the specific points 
1570.05,that I've given you here. 
1571.43,"And, I should say, enjoy this practice. "
1574.13,It's really nice to get outside first thing in the morning 
1576.56,and get this sunlight. 
1577.393,"In fact, when you start doing this, "
1579.71,you'll notice that your body 
1581.57,will start to feel more energized 
1584.06,and it will feel more energized more quickly. 
1586.55,You'll actually start 
1587.69,"to notice this mechanism kicking in each day, "
1590.06,especially if you're paying attention to your physiology. 
1592.309,So enjoy this practice of getting outside. 
1594.95,"Yes, you can take your morning beverage outside. "
1597.65,"Yes, you can take your dog with you. "
1599.57,"In fact, animals intuitively know "
1601.58,to get this morning sunlight. 
1602.75,They actually seek it out at the right times of days. 
1604.85,We human beings need to be told 
1606.53,by podcasters and other people 
1607.94,about the science that supports these kinds of practices. 
1610.61,Our pets apparently do not. 
1612.14,"But get outside alone or with somebody, "
1614.93,"with your kids, with your dog. "
1616.55,"However you go about this practice, "
1618.08,make sure you do this practice 
1619.97,at least 
80%,of the days of your life. 
1623.12,That's right. 
1623.96,"If you miss a day, "
1625.34,"for instance, you're bedridden for a day, "
1628.07,try and get next to a window. 
1629.774,"Let's say you are traveling, "
1631.94,"or for whatever reason, "
1633.44,"you are not able to get outside first thing in the morning, "
1636.14,"well, then try to get twice as much sunlight in your eyes, "
1638.81,or I should say extend the duration 
1640.46,of sunlight viewing in the morning 
1642.05,for twice as long the following day. 
1644.21,"This is a slow, integrative mechanism "
1647.06,that underlies this whole thing 
1648.53,of wakefulness during the day 
1649.363,and sleep at night due to sunlight viewing 
1651.68,"and if you miss a day, you can make up for it the next day, "
1653.9,but you have to get twice as much light 
1656.24,or twice as much duration of light. 
1659.45,If you really want to get technical 
1660.86,and you really want to measure 
1661.82,"how much light is in your environment, "
1663.2,"you can download a free app, something like Light Meter, "
1666.53,and that will allow your phone 
1667.94,to act as a bit of a light meter. 
1669.65,It'll give you a pretty accurate measurement 
1671.87,"of how many lux, which is a measure of brightness, "
1674.6,are in your environment in the morning. 
1676.52,"And in general, that's just going to be a good tool "
1679.16,for evaluating your environments. 
1682.73,Here's what I suggest you do. 
1684.17,"Wake up in the morning, take Light Meter, "
1686.45,"point it at the brightest light in your home, "
1688.31,"and take a measurement, "
1689.18,and what you'll probably find is it's about a thousand lux. 
1691.4,Now go outside and if there's some sunlight out 
1694.46,"and there's cloud cover, "
1695.48,point it at the sky and press that button. 
1697.64,You can actually hold it down 
1698.66,and it'll give you a dynamically updated lux measurement. 
1702.2,And what you'll find is like 
"5,",
"000,",
"10,",
"000,",
1704.45,sometimes even 
"90,",
000,"lux, "
1706.46,"even though you don't experience it as so much brighter, "
1708.62,and that's because an indoor artificial light 
1710.54,is very concentrated over a small spatial area 
1713.81,whereas the sunlight is very diffuse. 
1715.67,"But it's that diffuse, very bright sunlight, "
1717.68,"that photon energy, "
1718.58,that you really want 
1719.413,that's going to set all the rhythms of your brain and body 
1721.49,in the proper way. 
1723.53,"Not just that cortisol peak, "
1724.88,"but it's going to trigger proper metabolism, "
1727.16,it's going to set a timer for you 
1728.56,to be able to fall asleep about 
16,"hours later, "
1731.27,and on and on and on. 
1732.77,"And I should mention within the on and on and on, "
1734.81,"it's also going to suppress any melatonin, "
1737.66,a hormone that makes you sleepy 
1738.74,that happens to be swimming around in your bloodstream 
1740.93,at the time you wake up. 
1742.46,"It does a number of other things too, "
1743.93,including interact with the adenosine system 
1746.03,and kind of wash out some of the adenosine 
1747.89,that might still be residual if you didn't sleep enough. 
1751.55,"Fundamentally speaking, get that morning sunlight viewing. "
1754.901,I promise you will be grateful that you did. 
1758.27,"It makes everybody feel better, feel more alert, "
1761.18,and it will greatly assist with your ability 
1763.58,to fall and stay asleep later that night. 
1765.83,"Before we continue with today's discussion, "
1767.57,we're going to take a brief pause 
1769.16,"to acknowledge our sponsor, "
1770.78,"Athletic Greens, also called AG"
1.,
1773.42,I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 
2012.,
1776.75,So I'm delighted 
1777.71,that they've been a sponsor of this podcast. 
1780.14,"Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics, "
1782.99,"digestive enzymes, and adaptogens. "
1785.69,So it's got a lot of things in there. 
1787.01,That's actually the reason I started taking it 
1788.357,and the reason I still take it once or twice a day. 
1791.33,It essentially covers all of my nutritional bases. 
1793.61,And the probiotics in particular are important to me 
1795.68,because of the critical importance 
1797.03,"of what's called the gut-brain axis, "
1798.62,"that is neurons and other cell types in the gut, "
1801.86,"in the digestive tract, "
1802.94,that communicate with the brain 
1804.41,and the brain back to the digestive tract 
1806.66,"in order to control things like mood, "
1809.0,"immune function, hormone function, and on and on. "
1812.03,Whenever somebody has asked me 
1813.47,"what's the one supplement they should take, "
1815.63,I always answer Athletic Greens. 
1817.28,I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast 
1819.65,and it's the answer I still give now 
1821.42,for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago. 
1824.21,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
1825.59,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
1828.44,to claim a special offer. 
1829.58,They'll give you five free travel packs 
1830.99,that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens 
1832.73,"while you're on the road, "
1833.75,plus a year's supply of vitamin D
3K,
"2,",
1836.57,which are also very important 
1837.59,for a huge number of bodily factors and brain factors 
1840.89,that impact your immediate and long-term health. 
1842.81,"Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman "
1845.42,to claim that special offer. 
1846.8,"Okay, so now we're still focusing "
1848.15,"on this early part of the day when you've woken up, "
1850.19,the first hour or so after waking. 
1853.13,"And we can go to our list of other levers and tools, right? "
1856.88,We have light and dark. 
1858.23,We already talked about light and sunlight in particular. 
1861.56,"We've got temperature, food, exercise, "
1863.54,"caffeine, supplements, and digital tools. "
1866.18,"Now, once you've woken up and you want to be awake, okay? "
1869.48,So this is likely to be early in the day 
1871.7,if you're following a more standard schedule. 
1874.22,"You will also want to leverage not just light, "
1877.43,but temperature as a tool. 
1881.87,"If you are inclined, it would be wise "
1884.66,to try and increase your core body temperature 
1887.51,a bit more quickly than it would otherwise 
1890.48,"if you were to just, you know, shuffle around outside, "
1892.88,"get your sunlight, "
1893.713,"maybe read a little bit, et cetera, "
1894.98,and there are two main ways you can do that. 
1896.72,The first way is to get into cold water of some sort. 
1900.92,So this could be a cold shower 
1902.09,of anywhere from one to three minutes. 
1904.61,This could be an ice bath if that's your thing. 
1906.74,"It could be a cold tub, "
1908.21,or if you own a cold tub 
1910.55,that's specifically designed for deliberate cold exposure. 
1913.34,Get under some cold water. 
1915.35,That will certainly wake you up. 
1917.6,And if you've ever jumped into cold water 
1919.49,"or had a cold shower, "
1920.36,you know it really wakes you up 
1921.71,"because you release adrenaline, epinephrine, "
1924.95,"from both your brain and body, "
1927.44,the body from your adrenals 
1928.307,and your brain from a little cluster of neurons 
1930.11,called locus coeruleus. 
1931.37,"Again, the names don't matter. "
1932.87,One to three minutes of cold water exposure will wake you up 
1935.18,because of that adrenaline release 
1936.92,"and, and I want to highlight the and, "
1939.71,it will serve to increase your core body temperature. 
1943.49,"That's right, your body and brain interact "
1946.04,as a bit of a thermostat system 
1947.6,"where if you put something cold on the surface of your body, "
1949.91,"your brain, a little cluster of neurons "
1951.71,"in the so-called medial preoptic area, "
1953.9,"act as a thermostat and say, "
1955.587,"""Ah, the external of my body is cold "
1958.64,and therefore I'm going to heat up 
1960.35,"my core body temperature."" "
1961.46,So it's a little bit paradoxical. 
1962.75,"People think, oh, if you get into cold water or an ice bath, "
1965.21,your body temperature is going to drop. 
1966.53,"And indeed, that's true if you stay in for a while, "
1968.36,"but if you just get in for about one to three minutes, "
1970.34,"or under the cold shower for one to three minutes, "
1972.47,your core body temperature will increase. 
1975.14,"So then when you get out of that cold water, "
1977.42,"your body temperature is increasing at a rate, at a slope, "
1981.02,that's steeper than it would otherwise 
1983.18,and you're going to feel more alert. 
1984.38,It also has the advantage 
1985.34,"of increasing not just adrenaline, "
1987.08,"but dopamine, which is a molecule involved "
1988.91,"in motivation, focus, et cetera. "
1990.38,So this is great for waking up. 
1992.18,"So we've got sunlight, "
1993.29,"we've got temperature triggered by cold water, "
1995.42,and we have exercise. 
1997.76,One of the best ways 
1998.63,to increase your core body temperature early in the day 
2001.72,is to do exercise. 
2003.04,"Now, some of you might choose "
2004.9,to do your full-blown workout for the day 
2007.81,"first thing when you wake up in the morning, "
2009.25,"I would say the best time to exercise, "
2010.93,"at least what the research points to, "
2012.7,is immediately when you wake up in the morning 
2015.13,or three hours after waking or 
11,hours after waking. 
2018.91,But that's really getting down into optimization 
2021.58,for sake of muscular strength and grip strength 
2023.83,and it's very hard to give a strict prescriptive. 
2027.37,Here's what I suggest. 
2028.39,If you want to be alert early in the day 
2030.46,"and you want to sleep great at night, "
2032.71,"get that bright sunlight, get into some cold water, "
2035.53,"and if you don't want to get into some cold water, "
2037.81,try and get some movement. 
2039.19,It could be a walk. 
2040.39,So you can get your sunlight exposure 
2041.62,while you're taking a walk first thing in the morning. 
2044.26,It could be a light jog. 
2045.4,It could be skipping rope. 
2047.02,"These days, I skip rope for about "
10,minutes or 
20,minutes 
2049.54,while looking at the sun. 
2050.77,So I'm trying to layer in these different things 
2052.45,for waking up. 
2053.283,And then I take a cold shower afterwards. 
2054.94,"This is what I've been doing as of lately, "
2056.08,but I don't do that all year long necessarily. 
2059.14,Or some of you are going to be working out mid-morning. 
2062.26,I sometimes do that. 
2063.73,But try and get your core body temperature increased 
2066.97,"first thing in the morning, "
2068.17,and a great way to do that is with the cold water 
2071.14,and/or with exercise. 
2073.36,"And again, it doesn't have to be your full-blown workout "
2075.73,for the day 
2076.563,"if you're doing workouts consistently, "
2077.92,which I hope everybody is 
2079.0,because everybody really should exercise 
2081.16,"at least, I believe, five or six, "
2083.5,or maybe even seven days a week. 
2084.58,"For me, it's six days a week, sometimes five, "
2086.56,rarely is it seven. 
2088.12,So get that exercise 
2089.5,"or even just a modest amount of movement, "
2091.66,"walking, jogging, skipping rope, "
2093.73,some light calisthenics. 
2095.35,That will further increase your core body temperature 
2097.3,and help you feel more awake. 
2098.89,Then we have the category of caffeine. 
2100.6,"And again, we're just talking "
2101.47,"about this early part of the day, "
2102.73,"and you might be saying, ""Wait a second, "
2104.05,"I thought this was an episode about tools for sleep."" "
2106.39,"Well, everything that we're talking about doing "
2107.95,in these first 
60,to 
90,minutes of the day 
2111.28,really set in motion a wave of biological cascades 
2115.63,that carry through the entire day 
2117.46,and into the evening and into the night 
2118.78,and really do serve to optimize sleep. 
2120.82,So just hang in there with me. 
2122.59,And for those of you that are interested 
2123.67,"in focus and attention, your ability to learn, "
2125.86,all of these tools and practices 
2127.45,are going to greatly enhance those as well. 
2130.63,So the next category of tool 
2132.34,for use early in the day is caffeine. 
2134.38,Caffeine is a very important compound to think about. 
2137.2,"I do realize that some people who are prone to anxiety, "
2139.9,"especially panic attacks, anxiety attacks, "
2141.73,might avoid caffeine entirely. 
2144.13,That's absolutely fine. 
2145.12,You do not have to drink caffeine. 
2146.8,So what I'm about to describe 
2148.27,are ways to leverage caffeine use 
2150.61,to optimize sleep and wakefulness 
2152.92,"if you are comfortable with caffeine, if you like caffeine, "
2156.28,I happen to love caffeine. 
2157.36,I like it in the form of coffee or espresso 
2160.03,"or yerba mate tea, "
2161.53,in particular non-smoked varieties of yerba mate tea. 
2164.86,Non-smoked because the smoked varieties seem to carry 
2167.44,"some carcinogenics, some cancer causing risk. "
2169.69,There's increasing data on that. 
2170.98,So non-smoked varieties of yerba mate. 
2174.64,So caffeine is something 
2175.96,that a lot of people consume early in the day. 
2178.51,"How much depends on your tolerance, "
2180.79,and there's a lot of individual variability here. 
2182.89,"Again, caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, "
2185.35,or effectively works as an adenosine antagonist 
2187.72,and limits sleepiness. 
2188.89,I highly recommend 
2190.21,that everybody delay their caffeine intake 
2192.13,for 
90,to 
120,minutes after waking. 
2194.77,However painful it may be to eventually arrive 
2197.05,at that 
90,to 
120,"minutes after waking, "
2199.87,"you want, and I encourage you, "
2202.27,to clear out whatever residual adenosine 
2204.58,is circulating in your system 
2206.05,in that first 
90,to 
120,minutes of the day. 
2208.27,"Get that sunlight exposure, "
2209.29,"get some movement to wake up, "
2210.88,"and then, and only then, start to ingest caffeine "
2215.2,because what you'll do if you delay caffeine intake 
2218.41,until 
90,to 
120,minutes after waking 
2221.02,is you will avoid the so-called afternoon crash. 
2224.53,And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy 
2226.84,"in the afternoon, "
2227.673,but it's not going to be that massive crash. 
2229.54,I've talked about the reasons for that crash 
2231.94,on previous episodes. 
2233.23,But if you delay your caffeine intake 
2235.33,
90,to 
120,"minutes after waking, "
2237.04,you are doing yourself a great service towards wakefulness 
2240.04,and to avoid the crash. 
2241.39,"And the afternoon crash has another liability to it, "
2243.49,which is typically people will emerge 
2244.81,from that afternoon crash either grumpy or groggy 
2247.54,"and then they'll lean into drinking more caffeine, "
2250.42,which can then disrupt their sleep. 
2252.76,So wait 
90,to 
120,minutes after waking in the morning 
2255.58,to drink caffeine. 
2256.81,"And if you drink caffeine at any point throughout the day, "
2260.808,"really try and avoid any caffeine, "
2263.23,certainly avoid drinking 
2264.94,more than a hundred milligrams of caffeine after 
4:,
00,p.m. 
2268.63,and probably even better to limit your last caffeine intake 
2271.45,to 
3:,
00,p.m. or even 
2:,
00,p.m. 
2273.61,"And for many people, shifting that caffeine intake "
2276.4,from immediately after waking in the morning 
2278.56,to 
90,to 
120,minutes 
2280.06,gives them a much longer arc of energy throughout the day 
2282.85,and they don't feel the need 
2284.86,to drink more caffeine later in the afternoon. 
2287.59,"If you do drink caffeine later in the afternoon, "
2289.84,really try and limit the total amount or drink decaf. 
2292.75,Certainly keep the total amount 
2294.91,to less than a hundred milligrams 
2296.26,if you are interested 
2297.1,in getting into the best possible sleep. 
2298.81,"And I say this knowing that many people, including myself, "
2301.75,can drink a double espresso 
2303.49,with 
200,milligrams of caffeine or more 
2305.41,at 
5:,
00,p.m. or even 
6:,
00,p.m. or after dinner 
2308.41,"and still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine "
2310.78,or still sleep fine. 
2311.89,"However, there are terrific data, "
2314.53,"Matt Walker and I talked about this, "
2316.66,and there are more and more papers all the time 
2318.88,"that point to the fact that caffeine intake late in the day, "
2322.93,after 
4:,
00,"p.m. that is, "
2324.31,can really disrupt the architecture of your sleep. 
2326.65,"So you might think you're sleeping well, "
2328.06,but you're not sleeping nearly as well as you could 
2329.92,if you avoided caffeine in those afternoon hours. 
2333.04,"Now, some of you might be doing your main about of exercise "
2336.01,first thing in the morning 
2337.0,and you want your caffeine before that about of exercise. 
2339.73,"In that case, I say, go for it. "
2342.19,"Drink your caffeine, "
2343.023,do your workout right after waking up. 
2344.8,I don't have a problem with that. 
2346.66,"You will find, however, "
2347.65,that you're going to get an early afternoon dip in energy 
2350.167,and that dip in energy is going to be substantial 
2352.84,because it's going to be a dip in energy 
2354.91,that naturally follows that workout from the morning. 
2358.87,"So it's dependent on temperature, "
2361.27,and it's going to be related 
2363.25,to the elimination of that adenosine blockade by caffeine. 
2367.78,So you're getting a kind of a one-two punch 
2370.9,on your energy levels 
2371.89,by taking a lot of caffeine and exercising early in the day. 
2376.6,You can sort of expect 
2377.71,that you're going to get a drop in energy 
2379.84,in the early afternoon. 
2381.16,"That's okay if that works for you, "
2382.9,but just know that delaying that caffeine 
2385.09,
90,to 
120,minutes after waking 
2387.55,would be the ideal scenario most days and most scenarios. 
2392.98,"All that said, I absolutely respect the fact "
2395.68,"that people have different work schedules, "
2397.99,"kid schedules, et cetera. "
2400.0,"So if you want to do some or none or all these tools, "
2402.76,that's really up to you. 
2403.593,I'm just providing them to you 
2405.04,in the simplest form that I can possibly provide them. 
2408.61,"Now, the other lever or tool "
2410.35,that you have available to you is food. 
2412.57,"Not just what you eat, but when you eat. "
2414.64,"And it turns out that if you eat early in the day, "
2417.7,you support a biological clock mechanism 
2421.12,that will make you more alert early in the day. 
2424.24,"That said, many people choose to fast "
2426.16,in the early morning hours of the day 
2427.87,or in the first part of the day. 
2429.04,I'm one such person. 
2429.91,I generally don't ingest any food 
2432.64,until about 
11:,
00,a.m. or 
12,noon. 
2435.19,Sometimes I'll have a protein shake. 
2436.75,Sometimes I'll have some almonds. 
2438.1,Sometimes I'll have breakfast. 
2439.24,"If people are meeting for brunch or breakfast, "
2440.86,I will have breakfast for social reasons 
2442.886,every once in a while. 
2443.89,But most of the time I don't eat until about lunch time. 
2447.206,"However, some people are really hungry "
2449.05,when they wake up in the morning. 
2450.16,"Just know that if you eat early in the day, "
2453.16,you are further triggering an increase in metabolism 
2456.64,and in temperature that will make you more alert. 
2459.97,"So you don't have to eat early in the day, "
2462.13,but you can start to see 
2463.3,how these different tools layer together. 
2464.98,"Sunlight viewing, exercise, cold water, eating. "
2468.43,Many of them are converging on the same mechanisms. 
2470.86,"In fact, when you drink caffeine, "
2471.94,there's also a small increase in body temperature 
2474.13,due to the adrenaline increase that it stimulates. 
2476.217,So all of these things can be layered on top of one another 
2479.5,or you can use them individually 
2480.97,or think about them individually. 
2482.35,"Now, food is an interesting lever or tool "
2485.23,"because it's not just about when you eat, "
2486.76,but it's also about what you eat. 
2488.74,And I've talked a lot about eating for energy 
2491.62,and what that means in terms of caloric energy 
2493.6,"versus neural energy, et cetera, "
2495.49,in previous podcast episodes. 
2497.08,We're not going to focus on that now 
2498.37,"because, frankly, to get into a description "
2500.38,of whether or not somebody should eat fruits or vegetables 
2502.45,"or animal proteins or dairy, et cetera, early in the day, "
2505.27,that's very nuanced. 
2506.35,"What you eat for your breakfast, "
2507.64,"or if you choose to not eat breakfast, "
2508.93,is really up to you. 
2510.31,"All that said, if you eat a very large meal, "
2513.55,it doesn't matter if you slept terrifically well 
2516.79,
10,hours the night before 
2518.26,or if you are about to go to sleep 
2520.18,"or if it's the middle of the afternoon, "
2522.01,"if your gut is full of food, "
2524.11,"there's just a large volume of food in your gut, "
2526.15,it's going to divert a lot of blood 
2529.03,and other critical resources 
2531.43,"away from other organs of your body, "
2533.11,"in particular, your brain, "
2534.55,and you're going to be sleepy after eating a big meal. 
2536.89,"So this is sort of a duh, "
2538.24,but I think oftentimes in the discussions 
2540.73,"about what to eat for energy, "
2542.44,people neglect to consider food volume 
2545.05,as a strong parameter or variable in that discussion. 
2548.35,"So if you eat a huge breakfast, "
2549.7,it's likely that you are going to be tired 
2551.83,immediately after eating that breakfast 
2553.48,unless of course you exercise very hard prior to that 
2555.7,and you metabolize all that food very quickly. 
2558.64,So it's up to you whether or not to eat 
2560.47,first thing in the morning or not. 
2562.3,"But if you do eat in the first few hours of the morning, "
2565.36,just understand that you are setting 
2567.25,or you are helping to set 
2568.87,"a food entrained, as it's called, circadian clock. "
2572.62,"Light, temperature, timing of food intake, "
2576.3,"movement and exercise, "
2578.14,"all of these things literally funnel in in a neural sense, "
2582.43,they funnel into this thing that we call the circadian clock 
2585.55,"and they let that clock, that set of neurons, "
2588.43,predict when you are likely to be eating and active 
2591.67,and viewing sunlight 
2593.68,the next day and the next day and the next day. 
2595.45,"I say all this because there are some beautiful studies, "
2598.12,"and I'll highlight one, again, in the show note captions, "
2600.46,that show that if people are having a hard time 
2602.77,"waking up in the morning, "
2604.18,one of the things they can do 
2605.59,"is maximize sunlight viewing, exercise in the morning, "
2609.28,drink caffeine. 
2610.15,"Although, again, I support the idea "
2612.73,that that would best be done 
2613.96,about 
90,to 
120,minutes after waking. 
2617.53,"Eating some food in those early morning hours, "
2620.5,"et cetera, et cetera. "
2621.333,You can layer in multiple levers or tools 
2625.03,in order to be more alert. 
2626.68,And that's what these levers and tools are really there for 
2630.58,"in this sense of what we're talking about today, "
2632.68,which is optimizing sleep. 
2634.3,"Yes, they will make you more alert. "
2635.65,"Yes, they will provide some adrenaline and dopamine, "
2637.99,"for instance, the cold water, et cetera, et cetera. "
2640.39,But the reason we're talking about these things 
2642.7,in the context of sleep 
2644.41,is that they start to give your body 
2646.63,some predictable autonomic timing. 
2649.63,What is predictable autonomic timing? 
2651.64,"Well, your autonomic nervous system "
2652.87,is the components of your brain and body 
2655.21,that cause wakefulness and sleepiness 
2658.18,and you can start to create some predictability 
2661.18,in that autonomic timing. 
2662.62,You can start to do things that really make it such 
2664.99,that you naturally wake up at six in the morning 
2668.2,or five in the morning. 
2669.13,"That's right, if you're somebody "
2670.12,"who naturally is a night owl, "
2672.22,who likes to stay up until two in the morning 
2674.95,and sleep until 
10:,
00,"a.m., "
2676.48,and you now have a job or you have to go to school 
2678.61,or you have a partner that likes to get up early 
2680.17,"and go to sleep early, "
2681.7,"well, you can make that happen "
2683.08,and you can make that happen pretty painlessly 
2685.3,if you take a week or so 
2687.04,and go to sleep 
30,"minutes or an hour earlier each night, "
2690.91,set an alarm 
2691.743,and wake up 
30,minutes or an hour earlier each morning 
2696.07,"until, of course, you're waking up "
2697.15,"at the time you want to wake up, "
2698.14,"and then even in that groggy state, "
2701.2,"get some exercise, get some sunlight viewing. "
2703.33,"If the sun's not out, "
2704.2,turn on those bright artificial lights. 
2706.12,"Have some breakfast, even if you're not hungry. "
2708.22,"In fact, for those of you that engage in shift work "
2711.16,"because you have to, "
2712.0,"or travel and you're jet lagged, "
2714.01,one of the quickest ways to shift your circadian clock 
2717.19,and get onto the local schedule 
2718.51,is to eat on the local schedule. 
2720.64,So what all these tools do is they really set up a cascade. 
2724.69,Think of it as kind of a wavefront of wakefulness and focus 
2727.36,throughout the day. 
2728.32,It'll take you through the middle of the day 
2729.427,"and the afternoon stage we'll talk about in a few minutes, "
2732.46,but really they take you to this period 
2735.16,that is about 
5:,
00,p.m. until your bedtime. 
2738.67,"I realize some people are going to bed very early, "
2740.5,like 
8:,
00,p.m. or 
9:,
00,"p.m., which to me seems very early, "
2743.47,but very few people go to sleep at 
5:,
00,p.m. right? 
2745.87,Unless you're doing that for shift work or other reasons. 
2748.48,But from 
5:,
00,p.m. until bedtime is really a critical period 
2752.65,in which you need to leverage particular tools 
2755.02,in order to get and stay asleep optimally 
2758.26,and to be able to sleep through the night. 
2759.85,So really there are three critical periods 
2761.71,throughout each 
24-hour,cycle. 
2763.48,"And during each of those critical periods, "
2765.22,you're going to want to do 
2766.72,as many specific things as you can 
2769.15,to optimize your wakefulness 
2770.71,and focus and mood throughout the day 
2772.48,and your sleep at night. 
2775.09,The first critical period 
2775.99,is the one that we've been talking about up until now. 
2777.88,"Things like morning sunlight viewing, "
2779.23,caffeine 
90,to 
120,"minutes after waking, "
2781.48,"exercise, and so on. "
2782.92,We can call that critical period one 
2784.57,and it really encompasses the time from which you wake up 
2787.63,until about three hours after waking. 
2790.15,"Although, I should just mention "
2791.44,"'cause there are always those people that say, "
2792.347,"""Wait, I wake up at "
4:,
00,a.m. 
2793.75,and the sun isn't out until 
8:,
00,"a.m.,"" "
2795.33,"okay, so it might be four hours. "
2797.17,But really it's those early morning hours of your day 
2801.1,once you're awake. 
2802.45,The second critical period 
2804.16,is the time throughout the day and afternoon 
2807.07,leading into evening. 
2808.36,So you may ask what are the things that you can do 
2809.98,"throughout the day, "
2810.97,the middle of your day 
2811.81,"and into the afternoon and evening hours, "
2813.52,that are really going to set you up 
2814.63,for the best possible sleep later that night. 
2817.21,"Well, there are a few dos and there are a few don'ts. "
2820.33,"First of all, "
2821.32,be careful about ingesting too much caffeine 
2823.69,throughout the middle of the day. 
2824.68,That's kind of an obvious one 
2825.76,for the reasons that we talked about earlier. 
2828.04,"Second of all, if you are a napper, "
2830.95,"and I raise my hand now, "
2832.15,"for those of you listening, "
2832.983,I'm raising my right hand because I love naps. 
2835.18,I've always loved naps. 
2836.47,Nowadays I do NSDR or a Reveri sleep hypnosis 
2840.73,almost every day. 
2842.26,"And I tend to do that, as I mentioned, "
2843.91,in the early afternoon hours 
2845.41,"if I'm feeling kind of sleepy, "
2846.91,because even though I optimize 
2848.08,"my caffeine intake timing, et cetera, "
2850.36,I tend to get a little sleepy in the afternoon. 
2852.31,Most people get a little sleepy in the afternoon. 
2854.14,Some of that is related 
2855.1,to hitting that peak of body temperature. 
2857.08,"And you might think, wait, I thought high body temperature "
2859.66,"is associated with alertness, "
2861.4,"and it is, "
2862.233,but right as you crest that high body temperature 
2864.49,"and your body temperature starts to drop, "
2866.23,there's a tendency to be a little bit sleepy. 
2867.97,So some of you might opt to take a nap in the afternoon. 
2871.12,"Should you nap, should you not nap? "
2872.92,That's a question that I get asked a lot 
2874.48,and that I asked Dr. Matthew Walker 
2876.07,when he was a guest on this podcast. 
2877.63,Here was his answer and here's what the data support. 
2880.48,"It is fine to nap in the afternoon, "
2883.12,but don't nap so late in the day or for so long 
2886.57,that it disrupts your ability 
2887.98,to fall and stay asleep at night 
2890.11,"for your major sleep about, okay? "
2891.94,"So naps are fine, "
2893.26,but don't sleep so long during the day 
2895.36,or too late in the day 
2896.92,that it disrupts your ability to fall and stay asleep. 
2900.04,I should also say you do not have to nap. 
2903.043,It's kind of an interesting phenomenon 
2904.6,that happens on these podcasts and on social media 
2906.91,where we'll talk about naps 
2908.02,"and the fact that naps are great, "
2909.94,but don't make them longer than 
90,"minutes, "
2911.95,but then all the non-nappers get really worried. 
2914.29,"Like, wait, am I supposed to nap? "
2915.49,I don't like naps. I wake up groggy. 
2917.17,You do not have to nap. 
2918.49,"In fact, if you can make it "
2919.33,"through your whole day without napping, "
2920.98,"great, more power to you. "
2922.15,"But if you do nap and you find that naps serve you well, "
2925.75,keep those naps shorter than 
90,minutes 
2927.55,"for reasons related to ultradian cycles and so forth, "
2930.4,and make sure that you don't nap too late in the day 
2933.46,that you are then staying up too late at night 
2935.26,and having a hard time waking up the next morning. 
2937.66,I will say that for a lot of people who do not like naps 
2940.78,or that find they wake up really grumpy from naps 
2944.05,"or groggy from naps, "
2946.0,"I encourage you to try the Reveri app, "
2949.66,"try an NSDR script, try yoga nidra. "
2952.93,Try something of that sort 
2954.13,for anywhere from 
10,to 
20,to 
30,minutes. 
2956.98,I tend to do this every day now. 
2959.35,"I'll just lie down, and I love yoga nidra, "
2961.48,"I love NSDR scripts, "
2962.74,I love using the Reveri app. 
2964.33,"In particular, the portion of the Reveri app "
2967.0,that gets you better at sleeping. 
2968.59,It really is beneficial for me 
2970.9,because it serves as very replenishing 
2973.66,"while I'm doing that hypnosis, "
2975.16,but it's also gotten me much better 
2976.57,at falling and staying asleep 
2977.89,and falling back asleep in the middle of the night. 
2980.08,So this critical period throughout the day 
2982.21,is one in which most people are doing a lot of stuff. 
2984.07,They're emailing and picking up kids 
2985.63,and they're exercising and they're commuting 
2987.91,"and doing all sorts of things, "
2988.75,"taking phone calls and Zooms, et cetera. "
2990.7,But if you can get that period of deep relaxation 
2993.34,"through a nap or NSDR, "
2995.41,that's going to serve you well. 
2996.67,"Try not to drink too much caffeine, "
2998.23,"certainly no more than a hundred milligrams of caffeine, "
3001.32,after 
4:,
00,p.m 
3002.31,if your goal is to fall asleep at a reasonably normal time. 
3005.31,"And for those of you that exercise in the afternoon, "
3008.82,"understand that if you exercise very intensely, "
3012.18,so this might be weight training or running 
3013.74,"or some other very intense exercise, "
3015.87,typically that's going to further increase 
3017.94,your body temperature. 
3019.35,"Makes sense, right? "
3020.183,Based on everything we know 
3021.016,about metabolism and body temperature. 
3022.527,And it's going to so-called delay your circadian clock. 
3026.22,It's going to make it such 
3027.36,"that you want to fall asleep a little bit later, "
3030.63,maybe even a lot later. 
3031.98,So if you're exercising in the afternoon or evening 
3034.74,and that's the only time you can exercise 
3036.18,"or that's the time that you prefer to exercise, "
3038.22,"great, but be careful about ingesting too much caffeine "
3041.46,in order to get the energy to do that exercise 
3043.35,'cause that caffeine will disrupt your sleep 
3045.72,and just know that you are delaying your circadian clock. 
3049.68,You are making it such 
3050.64,that you will naturally want to go to sleep later 
3053.13,and wake up later. 
3054.78,"Contrast that with if you exercise early in the day, "
3057.78,"say, immediately after waking up "
3059.58,"or in the first zero to four hours after waking, "
3063.93,"in most cases, that's not going to shift "
3065.88,your circadian clock much. 
3067.56,"And toward the end of the episode, "
3069.12,we'll talk a little bit about forced exercise 
3072.06,prior to wake-up times. 
3073.47,That doesn't mean doing exercise in your sleep. 
3074.97,That means deliberately setting an alarm 
3076.44,and getting out of bed much earlier 
3077.7,than you naturally would. 
3078.9,That turns out to be a very potent tool 
3081.15,to so-called advance your circadian clock. 
3085.8,So we can talk about that a little bit later in the episode. 
3088.26,"But this critical period, too, in the middle of the day "
3091.5,"is when you're going to want to leverage specific tools, "
3093.96,and we've talked about those: 
3095.82,limiting caffeine intake; 
3097.47,being mindful of the clock-delaying effects of exercise; 
3100.95,"the fact that, also, if you're going to nap, "
3103.41,you don't want to nap too long or too late into the day 
3107.61,otherwise you'll disrupt your nighttime sleep. 
3109.59,"So this critical period two, "
3112.35,"or second critical period, I should say, "
3113.82,during the middle of the day 
3114.96,is a time in which you should be doing certain things 
3116.91,and avoiding doing certain things. 
3118.38,So that raises the question of whether or not 
3119.73,"you should also be getting a lot of light, "
3121.77,"in particular, sunlight, throughout the day. "
3123.72,"Now, that's something that hasn't been explored too much "
3125.34,in the literature 
3126.173,until recently when Dr. Samer Hattar 
3128.34,who's the director of the chronobiology unit 
3130.71,"at the National Institutes of Mental Health, "
3132.42,decided to do a number of experiments 
3133.68,exploring the effects of light on mood 
3135.75,and other aspects of brain function and body function 
3138.57,"when that light is delivered not just in the morning, "
3140.34,"which is great for us, "
3141.39,but also throughout the day. 
3142.86,So should you be looking at sunlight 
3144.9,or bright artificial lights throughout the day? 
3147.219,"Now, on the face of it, "
3148.26,"you might just think, yes, you know, sunlight's great. "
3150.48,Provided we're not getting a sunburn 
3152.28,"and we're not staring at the sun and damaging our eyes, "
3154.77,we should get as much sunlight as we possibly can. 
3157.11,"In fact, we talked about this in the episode on hormones "
3159.63,about how getting light onto as much of our skin 
3162.394,as we can throughout the day 
3164.19,can really help in the production 
3165.51,of testosterone and estrogen in both men and women 
3167.55,in healthy ways that improves mood and libido 
3169.77,and all sorts of things that are associated with wellbeing. 
3173.76,"However, because light is such a powerful stimulus "
3176.31,for controlling the timing 
3177.57,"of your sleepfulness, or sleepiness, I should say, "
3180.42,"and wakefulness, "
3182.37,we might want to be cautious 
3183.51,"about how much light we are viewing in the afternoon, "
3186.15,"in particular, in the early evening hours, right? "
3189.09,"Well, turns out it's not so straightforward. "
3192.0,"Viewing, so sunlight to the eyes, sunlight "
3194.94,"in the late afternoon and evening hours, "
3197.22,"so again, depends on time of year, "
3198.81,"depends on location that you happen to be in, "
3201.12,but getting some sunlight in your eyes 
3202.53,"for, again, maybe five or "
"10,",maybe 
30,"minutes, "
3206.52,"depending on how much cloud cover there is, "
3208.47,doing that in the afternoon 
3210.33,"serves an additional beneficial purpose, "
3213.21,which is you protect or you inoculate your nervous system 
3217.86,against some of the negative effects 
3219.93,of bright artificial light 
3221.55,or even dim artificial light in the nighttime hours 
3226.05,between 
10:,
00,p.m. and 
4:,
00,"a.m., "
3227.37,which is really critical period three. 
3229.32,And we'll talk about what to do and what to not do 
3231.78,during critical period three of every 
24-hour,cycle. 
3234.81,"But to make it very clear what I'm saying here, "
3237.36,"get that morning sunlight in your eyes, "
3239.4,but also get some sunlight in your eyes 
3241.47,in the late afternoon and evening hours 
3243.69,"when the sun is at so-called low solar angle, "
3245.76,when it starts to descend in the sky. 
3247.89,"Again, you don't have to stare directly at the sun, "
3249.72,"although if you can catch a nice, beautiful sunset, "
3251.58,go for it. 
3252.42,"But as the sun starts to descend, "
3255.052,it triggers those same neurons in your eye 
3258.889,"that communicate with your circadian clock, "
3261.09,but it communicates with a different component 
3264.15,or different compartment within the circadian clock. 
3266.34,That circadian clock is not just one thing. 
3268.56,It's multiple things. 
3269.393,And you have what are called morning oscillators 
3270.99,and evening oscillators. 
3272.07,"And to make a long story short, "
3273.81,the tool that I'm describing of looking at the sun 
3277.53,"in the late afternoon and evening, "
3279.51,"again, blinking is fine, "
3281.76,"don't stare at the sun, "
3282.69,but getting that sunlight in your eyes 
3283.98,in the late afternoon and evening 
3285.78,signals to that clock that it's evening time 
3290.13,and that sleep is coming. 
3291.96,It also serves as a second anchor or reference point 
3296.46,for your body and your brain to know where it is in time. 
3299.88,Remember back to the beginning of the episode 
3301.5,when I said your brain and your body and all your organs 
3303.84,are locked inside this skin and this skull 
3306.06,and they don't know what's going on in the outside world. 
3308.34,"Well, that morning sunlight viewing "
3309.777,"and the other things you do during critical period one, "
3312.87,those provide one strong set of signals 
3315.42,that it's wake-up time and time to be alert 
3316.827,and time to be focused. 
3318.33,"And then in the evening, "
3320.19,"by getting sunlight in your eyes again, "
3323.61,"in particular, sunlight that comes "
3325.26,"from low solar angle sunlight, "
3327.81,"well, that provides a second stimulus "
3329.85,or a second reference point 
3331.44,"that tells your brain and body, ""Hey, it's evening. "
3333.99,"The sun is descending."" "
3335.7,"Now, you might say, "
3336.533,"""Wait, how does the brain and these neurons know "
3338.61,"the difference between morning light and evening light?"" "
3340.56,It turns out has to do 
3341.67,with the particular wavelengths of light 
3343.89,that are present in morning versus evening. 
3346.17,It's an incredible mechanism. 
3347.82,And you are probably familiar with the fact 
3350.76,"that when the sun is directly overhead, "
3352.77,it's really bright white and yellow 
3355.5,"and the sky's often blue, "
3356.76,"and if there's cloud cover, "
3357.69,"it just comes through as a bunch of bright light, "
3359.58,"well, next time you're out in the morning, "
3360.99,take a look at what a sunrise looks like. 
3362.67,"There's a lot of yellow-blue contrast, "
3364.86,and those yellow blues signal 
3366.57,important specific sets of cells in your eye and brain 
3369.63,that it's morning. 
3370.62,"In the evening, you're also going to see yellow and blue, "
3373.11,but the ratio of yellows and blues has now changed 
3376.44,"and you also see some oranges, "
3377.76,"and in a really brilliant sunset, you'll see some reds. "
3380.339,"If you haven't noticed this already, "
3382.32,you'll really want to look for this. 
3383.43,It's really kind of fun and cool to look at. 
3385.89,"Well, those yellows and blues and oranges "
3388.83,"that you see in the evening sunsets, "
3390.33,those signal to your brain and body that evening is there 
3393.33,and that nighttime is coming 
3394.77,and they're really establishing 
3396.12,a second reference point or wavefront of biological signals 
3399.96,that are going to optimize your nighttime hours 
3402.237,and your transition into really terrific sleep. 
3405.12,So now let's talk 
3406.17,about what I'm calling critical period three 
3408.78,of each 
24-hour,cycle. 
3410.16,"So this would be the period of time of late evening, "
3413.01,So it might be 
6:,
00,"p.m. for some, "
3415.56,"depending on when you go to sleep, "
3416.61,or 
7:,
00,p.m. 
3417.6,extending into the hours 
3419.97,in which you decide to get into bed and go to sleep 
3422.28,and then throughout the night. 
3423.87,There are a number of things 
3424.703,that you're going to want to do 
3425.76,and there are a number of things 
3427.2,that you are going to want to avoid doing 
3429.39,in order to optimize your sleep. 
3431.22,"First of all, you're going to want to avoid "
3433.89,bright artificial lights of any color. 
3438.06,"Yes, of any color. "
3440.04,"We haven't talked a lot about blue blockers, "
3441.72,"you know, lenses that block blue wavelengths "
3443.82,or short wavelengths of light. 
3446.19,I don't have anything against blue blockers. 
3447.84,"In fact, many people find that blue blockers provide them "
3450.57,some relief from headache and some eye strain 
3454.05,if they wear blue blockers 
3455.01,throughout the day and certainly at night. 
3456.45,"But you don't need them, "
3457.89,"and even if you do wear them, "
3460.05,"you will find that if lights are very bright, "
3462.39,"doesn't matter if it's a blue light, "
3463.56,"a yellow light, or a red light, "
3465.33,those bright lights will wake up your brain and body. 
3468.66,They will activate the same mechanisms 
3471.06,that were activated early in the day by sunlight. 
3473.49,"However, and here's the really diabolical twist, "
3476.52,"I mentioned this earlier, "
3477.353,but the diabolical twist 
3478.68,in the way that your brain and body respond to light 
3481.26,"is that early in the day, "
3483.24,"in the morning hours, you need a lot of bright light, "
3484.98,"ideally from sunlight, "
3486.09,"to be very alert and to wake up, "
3488.55,"but in the evening hours and nighttime hours, "
3490.95,"it takes very little light, very few photons, "
3494.55,in order to wake up your brain and body 
3497.07,and to disrupt your circadian clock and disrupt your sleep. 
3500.37,"So what that means is that once the sun goes down, "
3504.63,"which, of course, is going to happen "
3506.37,"at different times of year in different places on earth, "
3508.92,"but once the sun goes down, "
3510.6,you would be wise to try and dim the lights 
3512.94,"in your indoor environment most days, right? "
3515.49,I realize some nights you're going to throw a party 
3516.9,and have people over. 
3517.95,You might not want to dim the lights. 
3518.97,"Some nights you're going to go out, "
3520.32,you might view a lot of bright lights. 
3521.55,"But most nights of your life, "
3523.53,you're going to want to dim the lights 
3525.15,in your internal environment. 
3528.173,"And ideally, the lights that you do use "
3530.61,you would place low in that physical environment. 
3532.83,"So you would try and not use overhead lights, "
3535.02,but rather rely on desk lamps or lights 
3537.51,"even placed low to the floor, even on the floor. "
3540.96,"If you are going to use light at night, "
3543.36,"and most people do, "
3544.92,I would encourage you to use as little artificial light 
3547.53,as is required to carry out the activities you need 
3550.29,to require safely. 
3551.82,"That could be studying, "
3552.653,in which case you might need a little bit more light 
3554.43,in order to read or study. 
3556.05,If you're watching a television show 
3558.15,"or you're watching something on your computer, "
3559.92,"dim that screen way, way down, "
3561.51,"as dim as possible while still, of course, being able "
3564.18,to view what you need to view. 
3565.56,"Even better, I should say, ideally, "
3567.81,you would use candlelight and/or moonlight. 
3570.15,"Now, some nights the moon is really bright "
3571.89,and you actually can use moonlight 
3573.66,to go about your usual activities. 
3575.37,"Moonlight might seem very, very bright, "
3577.92,"but, actually, moonlight is fairly low light intensity, "
3582.75,"and candlelight, which can also seem very bright, "
3585.39,actually is very low light intensity. 
3587.85,If you're sitting across a table 
3589.95,with some candlelight there 
3590.88,"and it's a really bright candle, "
3592.71,chances are it's only about three to 
10,"lux, "
3595.95,"which is very, very little light energy "
3598.59,"compared to, say, an artificial desk lamp "
3600.78,"or an overhead light, "
3601.613,which is going to be in the area 
3602.67,of anywhere from a hundred to a thousand lux. 
3605.64,So candlelight is fine. 
3607.41,"Of course, be cautious with open flame, "
3609.93,but candlelight is fine. 
3611.19,Moonlight is fine. 
3612.21,Dimming artificial lights is fine 
3614.31,"provided they're dimmed way, way down. "
3616.23,"And again, try and avoid using overhead artificial lights. "
3620.4,The absolute worst lights 
3621.57,are going to be overhead fluorescent lights 
3623.12,of the sort that you would have in the supermarket 
3626.04,or that you would see at a gas station 
3628.47,or something of that sort. 
3629.55,"And I confess, there are times in which I'm driving home "
3633.57,and it's late at night and I want to be able to get to sleep 
3635.76,and I'll need to stop at the grocery store 
3637.74,"or a gas station or something like that, "
3639.06,I've actually put on sunglasses at night 
3640.95,in order to avoid getting 
3642.42,that bright light exposure at night. 
3645.09,"Although that's a little bit extreme, "
3646.8,I have done that from time to time 
3648.39,because that bright light exposure 
3650.04,"will absolutely quash, it will eliminate, "
3652.86,any melatonin that happens to be circulating 
3655.53,in your brain and body. 
3656.363,"Now, melatonin, a lot of people think of it as a supplement, "
3658.56,but melatonin is naturally released 
3660.81,as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours. 
3663.75,It's the hormone that makes you feel sleepy 
3665.76,and allows you to fall asleep. 
3667.44,So viewing bright light 
3669.15,in the late evening hours and nighttime hours 
3671.01,is really not good for your sleep quality 
3674.49,and your ability to fall and stay asleep. 
3677.01,"So for most people, a simple rule of thumb "
3679.2,"is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors, "
3683.1,"and in particular, overhead bright artificial lights, "
3685.2,between the hours of 
10:,
00,p.m. and 
4:,
00,a.m. 
3687.63,"That's right, between "
10:,
00,p.m. and 
4:,
00,"a.m., "
3689.13,avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible. 
3692.28,Use only as much light as is absolutely necessary 
3695.55,in order to carry out the routines and activities 
3697.95,you need to carry out safely. 
3699.84,I should mention 
3700.673,that the reason overhead lights are problematic 
3702.93,is the same reason why sunlight is so great 
3705.66,"early in the day, "
3706.493,"which is that the cells, that is, the neurons, "
3709.05,that can wake up your brain and body 
3711.48,through activation of the circadian clock 
3713.43,reside mainly in the bottom half or 
2/,
3,
3716.22,of your neural retina 
3717.18,and the way the optics of your eyes work 
3719.22,is that the cells on the bottom half of your eye 
3721.53,view the upper visual field. 
3722.94,So this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism 
3725.85,that allows these cells 
3727.08,to respond to overhead light from sunlight 
3731.04,in the early part of the day and throughout the day. 
3733.17,"But in the evening, if you have bright artificial lights on "
3735.717,"and those bright artificial lights are overhead lights, "
3738.3,it's going to more closely mimic 
3740.79,"what sunlight does in the evening time, "
3743.4,and that turns out to be a bad thing 
3744.69,if your goal is to eventually go to sleep. 
3746.64,"So again, do like the Scandinavians do. "
3749.064,"Use lights that are set low in the room at night, "
3752.1,"and if you really want to optimize your sleep-wake cycles, "
3755.1,I suppose you could also do the opposite throughout the day. 
3757.47,You could really emphasize the use 
3758.82,of bright artificial lights and sunlight 
3761.22,that comes from above. 
3762.053,"And of course, sunlight always comes from above. "
3763.86,But if you're working in a given office environment 
3768.6,"and, you know, it's "
2:,
00,p.m. or 
3:,
00,p.m. 
3770.22,"and you want to be as awake as possible, "
3772.08,really crank up the overhead lights. 
3772.913,"And then in the evening, "
3774.81,"which is this critical period three that we're referring to, "
3777.09,really try and dim those lights or have them off 
3780.09,or just rely on candlelight or moonlight 
3781.83,from the hours of about 
10:,
00,p.m. until 
4:,
00,a.m. 
3785.28,"Our good friend Samer Hattar, "
3786.57,"who's been on this podcast before, "
3788.1,Samer is director of the chronobiology unit 
3790.17,"at the National Institutes of Mental Health, "
3792.21,"well, he's absolutely obsessive about this light stuff "
3795.18,and avoiding light at night. 
3796.11,"In fact, he lives in what I sort of joke "
3799.29,is like a cave at night. 
3800.46,From 
9:,
00,p.m. until 
5:,
00,"a.m., "
3802.35,"which is really his kind of sleep cycle, "
3805.38,he has his house so dark 
3807.33,that you'd be lucky to be able 
3808.32,to find a spoon in the kitchen. 
3809.94,"In fact, you'd be lucky "
3810.773,to find your way down the hallway if you're me. 
3812.55,"But in any case, dim the lights. "
3814.35,"Turn them way, way down. "
3815.61,It will serve you well. 
3816.54,It will make it much easier for you 
3818.76,to get sleepy and stay sleepy and fall asleep 
3821.79,and stay asleep throughout the night. 
3823.56,"Now, not to depart from this critical period three, "
3826.44,"but if you recall, viewing that afternoon light, "
3831.42,the low solar angle light 
3832.86,"as the sun is heading down in the sky, "
3834.75,so it could be sunset 
3835.83,"or what I call circa sunset, around sunset, "
3839.49,"well, doing that is going to slightly, "
3841.68,"but not completely, offset any of the negative effects "
3844.5,of viewing artificial light at night. 
3846.81,"So I don't want to give people a pass here, "
3848.49,but let's say you know 
3849.84,that you're going to watch some Netflix at night 
3853.02,or you're going to be up late studying 
3854.91,and yet you still want to be able to fall and stay asleep. 
3857.55,Definitely make sure you see that evening light. 
3860.07,There's a great study. 
3861.3,"We'll provide a link to this study, "
3862.53,which showed that if people view evening sunset light 
3866.85,or evening sunsets 
3867.87,"or sunlight right around the time of sunset, "
3870.03,"it really serves to inoculate or offset some, "
3873.75,"again, some, not all, of the negative effects "
3875.73,of artificial light 
3876.563,between the hours of 
10:,
00,p.m. and 
4:,
00,a.m. 
3878.7,"Now, that's light. "
3879.533,"But as you recall, "
3880.41,"we also have this tool related to temperature, "
3883.17,and you're probably not going to be surprised 
3886.14,that the way to leverage temperature in the evening 
3888.69,is the exact opposite 
3889.77,of the way that you want to leverage temperature 
3891.69,early in the day. 
3892.523,"Early in the day, temperature increases "
3894.3,"from cold showers or exercise, et cetera, wake you up. "
3897.24,What that means is that taking a cold shower late at night 
3899.97,is probably a bad idea. 
3901.89,"Rather, taking a nice hot bath or a sauna, "
3905.97,"you might think would heat up your body, "
3907.68,"and indeed, that's what happens "
3908.7,"if you stay in a very long time, "
3910.32,but if you do hot tub or a hot bath 
3912.69,"or a sauna in the evening, "
3913.74,and you don't stay in for more than 
20,or 
30,minutes 
3915.93,"and you get out, "
3916.763,"you take maybe a cool-ish shower or a warm shower, "
3920.34,then what happens is there's a compensatory cooling off 
3923.37,of your core body temperature 
3924.63,"for the reasons we discussed earlier, "
3926.07,and your body temperature will drop by one to three degrees 
3929.1,and it will make it much easier to get into sleep. 
3931.53,So if you're somebody 
3932.363,"that enjoys hot baths, hot showers, or hot tubs, "
3935.73,evening and nighttime 
3936.78,is going to be the best time to do that 
3938.1,if your goal is to facilitate sleep. 
3940.41,"Similarly, you should try "
3941.94,"and make your sleeping environment pretty cool, if not cold. "
3945.48,"Now, that doesn't mean you need to be cold "
3946.83,while you're asleep. 
3947.97,"You can get under as many blankets as you need, "
3949.83,but it's a good idea to make your sleeping environment cool. 
3952.74,"In fact, drop the temperature in that sleeping environment "
3955.02,by at least three degrees 
3956.97,and you'll be happy that you did. 
3958.74,"Now, some people rely on things like Eight Sleep. "
3961.14,I use that. 
3961.973,One of these controllable temperature mattress covers. 
3965.07,Other people would simply do this 
3966.48,by putting a fan in the room or opening a window. 
3969.27,"Again, depends on time of year, "
3970.41,"depends on technology, depends on budgets, et cetera. "
3972.66,But you're going to want to sleep 
3973.89,in a relatively cool or cold sleeping environment 
3976.65,and then layer on the blankets as needed to stay asleep. 
3980.88,And I say as needed because one of the things 
3983.04,"that you're going to do in your sleep, "
3985.59,"or if you happen to wake up, "
3987.12,"is if you're too warm, you're going to put a foot or a hand "
3990.21,out from under those blankets. 
3992.25,And the reason for doing that is very logical 
3994.47,once you understand the mechanism. 
3995.97,"You have special portals, "
3997.68,"you essentially have ways of passing heat, "
4000.56,"excuse me, in and out of your body "
4003.11,"primarily through the palms of your hands, "
4004.88,"the upper half of your face, "
4005.9,and the bottoms of your feet 
4007.22,through so-called glabrous skin. 
4008.54,This was covered in the episode with Dr. Craig Heller 
4010.88,from the biology department at Stanford. 
4013.79,"If you lower the temperature in your sleeping environment, "
4015.89,so lower the temperature in that room 
4017.51,or use a controllable mattress cover that can cool down 
4020.48,"like Eight Sleep or something of that sort, "
4022.31,"it's naturally going to make your sleep environment cooler, "
4025.67,"and if you're too warm under the blankets, "
4027.77,all you have to do is extend a hand or a foot 
4029.66,out from under those blankets. 
4031.04,Whereas if the sleeping environment that you're in 
4032.84,"is too warm, "
4034.04,there's very little you can do to cool off 
4036.05,besides push off those blankets. 
4037.79,"So for instance, if you're too warm "
4039.02,"and you're waking up in the middle of the night, "
4040.34,"which is what happens if you get too warm, "
4042.14,you'll push off those blankets. 
4043.25,"But if the room is too warm, "
4044.9,"well, what are you going to do? "
4045.733,You'd probably have to put your hands into some cool water 
4047.72,or take a coolish shower or something 
4049.82,for a couple of seconds. 
4050.96,That's not very practical. 
4052.34,Better to just keep the sleeping environment cool. 
4055.19,I'm not a big fan of people putting socks on 
4057.8,"while they sleep, "
4058.633,"or I should say, I'm not a fan of putting socks on "
4060.29,"while I sleep, "
4061.123,because that eliminates this glabrous skin portal 
4063.35,on the bottoms of one's feet. 
4064.85,"So for those of you that have heard, "
4065.96,"you know, wear socks while you sleep, "
4067.22,that works great for people 
4068.66,that tend to run too cold while they sleep 
4070.91,"and wake up because their feet get cold, "
4072.68,but if you're somebody who wakes up 
4073.85,"in the middle of the night, "
4074.683,chances are you're waking up 
4075.516,because you're getting too warm 
4077.93,and the best thing that you could do 
4079.07,is to cool or lower the temperature 
4081.05,in the room that you're sleeping 
4081.92,"and not wear socks, "
4083.03,"get under as many blankets as you need to fall asleep, "
4085.7,"and then across the night, "
4086.87,you'll naturally just move a hand or a foot 
4088.64,or all hands and feet out from under those blankets 
4090.77,to cool off 
4091.91,because of the relationship between temperature and sleep. 
4094.4,"That is, dropping your core body temperature "
4096.59,one to three degrees 
4097.82,gets you into sleep and helps you stay asleep. 
4099.95,So let's say you do exercise late in the day 
4101.87,and you're finding yourself very alert in the evening 
4103.76,"and you need to fall asleep, "
4105.35,or let's say you've exercised 
4106.73,and you needed four cups of espresso 
4109.31,in order to do that exercise. 
4110.99,"Well, there are a few things that you can do "
4112.07,to try and bring your nervous system down 
4114.17,"into more state of calmness, "
4115.82,and you can do that 
4116.653,also by lowering your core body temperature. 
4119.18,"One of those I already talked about before, "
4120.74,taking a nice hot shower or a hot bath 
4123.2,and then getting out and cooling off 
4124.49,will decrease your body temperature. 
4126.32,Maybe not enough to get you into sleep 
4128.54,if you have a ton of caffeine in your system. 
4131.0,"But again, you can use this mechanism of temperature shifts "
4134.9,to wake up 
4136.13,or temperature shifts to fall asleep 
4137.63,in ways that really can help you overcome 
4139.73,some of the irregularities in your sleep-wake cycle 
4143.57,"and exercise cycle, et cetera. "
4145.46,"Because, of course, nobody's perfect. "
4147.32,Some days we end up having to workout in the afternoon 
4149.54,or we'll miss the workout entirely. 
4151.34,"Other days, we end up having that cup of coffee "
4153.23,in the afternoon with a friend 
4154.16,and then we have a hard time falling asleep. 
4155.96,So you can use these tools 
4157.22,"not just in their optimized form, "
4158.794,"you know, being absolutely obsessive and compulsive "
4161.45,about exactly when you do each of those tools. 
4163.64,"That would be wonderful, but life happens as they say "
4167.09,and some days you're going to feel too alert at night 
4169.361,"and you want to fall asleep, "
4170.42,or you've got to get up especially early the next morning 
4173.42,and you're not somebody 
4174.253,who normally goes to bed at 
10:,
00,p.m. 
4175.79,"Well, that's when a something like a hot bath or a sauna "
4177.95,can really benefit you 
4178.783,because it can adjust your temperature rhythm accordingly. 
4181.1,I would be remiss if I didn't touch on alcohol 
4184.04,and CBD and THC. 
4186.08,I always get questions about these. 
4188.0,"And I should say, of course, "
4189.89,"many places, but not all, THC is illegal. "
4192.98,"Although, there are medical uses "
4194.36,"and in some places, it's decriminalized, "
4196.97,other places it's legal. 
4198.83,"Alcohol, of course, is consumed "
4200.81,almost as frequently as caffeine is consumed. 
4203.57,I personally don't drink alcohol. 
4204.86,I don't have anything against it per se. 
4207.14,I just don't tend to enjoy it. 
4209.12,One of the reasons I don't enjoy it 
4210.28,"is if I drink alcohol, I simply fall asleep. "
4212.93,So that doesn't really accomplish 
4214.61,any of the things that I really want to accomplish 
4216.59,because the sleep that one gets after drinking alcohol 
4220.13,is greatly disrupted sleep. 
4222.35,"Hate to break it to you, but that's the truth. "
4224.81,"And when Dr. Matt Walker came on this podcast, "
4227.45,he said exactly the same thing. 
4229.1,While THC and alcohol do help some people fall asleep 
4235.31,"and maybe even stay asleep, "
4236.36,the architecture of that sleep is suboptimal 
4239.48,compared to the sleep they would get 
4240.71,without alcohol or THC in their system. 
4243.08,So I'm not here to tell you what to do or not to do. 
4245.63,I'm certainly not the substance police. 
4248.87,That's not my role. 
4250.01,I'm just reporting to you the biology. 
4251.57,If your sleep is not restoring you 
4254.66,"to the extent that you feel it should, "
4256.67,or if you are regularly relying on a drink or two 
4259.91,"in order to fall asleep, "
4261.79,"or THC in order to fall asleep, "
4264.5,that is disrupting your total pattern of sleep. 
4267.35,"However, I do realize "
4268.73,"that nowadays a lot of people are relying on THC and/or CBD, "
4272.96,"especially edible forms, "
4274.1,in order to fall and stay asleep. 
4275.767,"And, you know, we can just acknowledge the data. "
4278.57,It does seem that there's an anxiety lowering effect 
4281.48,of some of those compounds 
4282.83,that do help people 
4284.27,who have a hard time falling and staying asleep 
4286.58,because of reasons related to anxiety. 
4288.86,"Although, in a moment, "
4289.693,we'll talk about some supplements and supplement protocols 
4293.18,that can also assist in the ability to fall and stay asleep 
4296.15,and that can adjust anxiety 
4297.65,and that do not seem to disrupt sleep architecture 
4300.23,in negative ways 
4301.063,"and, in fact, can enhance the depth and quality "
4303.5,of sleep architecture. 
4304.82,"Okay, so you've done everything correctly up until now. "
4307.58,You got your morning routine from critical period one. 
4309.663,You've got your afternoon routine. 
4311.51,You saw some sunlight in the afternoon. 
4313.58,You avoided caffeine in the eight hours 
4315.32,or 
10,hours before bedtime. 
4317.09,You're not drinking alcohol. 
4318.47,You've cooled down the room. 
4320.42,You're doing all these things right. 
4321.53,"You've dimmed the lights, et cetera, et cetera. "
4324.17,What else can we do in order to optimize our sleep? 
4326.69,"Well, I always say behavioral tools first, "
4330.59,"then look to nutrition, "
4331.85,"then, if necessary, look to supplementation, "
4334.52,"and then, if still necessary, look to prescription drugs "
4338.81,obviously prescribed by a board certified physician. 
4341.99,"Well, we've talked a lot about the behavioral tools "
4344.18,for critical period three. 
4345.65,We have not talked a lot 
4346.91,about the supplementation-based tools. 
4348.92,There are supplements that for most people 
4350.96,will greatly improve their ability to fall and stay asleep 
4355.07,and the three main supplements in that category 
4358.43,"or that kit of sleep supplements, "
4360.8,"and I've talked about these before, "
4362.06,"are magnesium threonate, so T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, "
4368.21,"apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, "
4371.93,"and theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine. "
4375.38,"Now, some important things to point out "
4376.97,"about mag threonate, as it's called, apigenin, and theanine. "
4380.3,"First of all, "
4381.5,"you don't necessarily need to take all three, "
4383.51,"although, many people get a synergistic effect "
4385.94,from taking all three. 
4387.17,"In fact, you may not even need to take even one. "
4390.23,What I recommend is that if you're already doing 
4393.05,all the behavioral tools regularly 
4395.66,and you're still having trouble falling asleep 
4397.91,"and staying asleep, "
4399.44,"well, then you might try one of the supplements "
4403.04,within this sleep stack. 
4404.15,They do have fairly wide margins for safety. 
4406.19,"Although, I should also say, "
4408.53,anytime you're going to add or remove something 
4410.63,"from your supplement protocol or your nutritional program, "
4413.09,you definitely want to talk to your physician. 
4414.59,I don't just say that to protect us. 
4415.76,I say that to protect you. 
4417.14,"But for most people, the margins of safety on these things "
4419.3,are going to be pretty broad. 
4420.59,A couple of notes about dosages. 
4422.96,"For some people, the dosages of any one or several "
4425.54,of the supplements I mentioned will be zero. 
4427.82,"That is, you won't need them "
4428.93,in order to get and stay asleep most nights of your life. 
4433.22,That's terrific if you don't need them. 
4435.23,"For many people, however, "
4436.67,taking 
145,milligrams of magnesium threonate 
4441.17,can be very beneficial. 
4442.49,That's the dosage that most people will benefit from. 
4446.24,Some people need to go a little higher. 
4447.53,Some people need to go a little bit lower. 
4449.51,One of the reasons that we've been pointing people 
4451.16,towards single-ingredient formulations these days 
4454.76,is because it allows people 
4456.14,to adjust the dosage of one component 
4458.63,of a so-called sleep stack 
4459.77,"without having to disrupt the dosage of another component, "
4463.61,and so on. 
4464.443,It also allows people to try 
4465.56,just one element within the sleep stack 
4468.32,"without having to purchase and try the others, "
4470.96,which is a problem if you're buying a blend 
4472.52,of a lot of different ingredients. 
4473.93,So 
145,milligrams of magnesium threonate. 
4477.08,
"50,",
5-,
"0,",milligrams of apigenin. 
4479.87,"And again, you could just take the apigenin on its own. "
4482.54,And 
100,to 
400,milligrams of theanine 
4486.56,"taken, again, alone or in combination "
4488.84,with the other supplements mentioned in the stack 
4491.36,many people find allows them to get really drowsy 
4494.21,"and fall asleep, sleep really deeply, "
4496.61,and they feel much more refreshed the next day 
4498.77,and they don't have a grogginess to them. 
4501.11,"Now, a couple of notes about these different supplements. "
4504.62,About 
5%,of people report 
4507.65,that magnesium threonate really disrupts their gut. 
4510.38,It gives them diarrhea or gastric distress. 
4512.63,"In which case, don't take it. "
4514.43,If magnesium threonate disrupts your gut or your digestion 
4519.113,to a point where it's uncomfortable or at all 
4521.21,"and you don't like it, don't take any of it. "
4523.04,"The proper dosage for you, in other words, "
4524.39,would be zero milligrams. 
4526.13,"Now, in a slightly different way, "
4528.23,many people who can tolerate magnesium threonate 
4531.26,or really thrive on magnesium threonate 
4533.78,and like apigenin 
4535.01,"might find that theanine, "
4537.05,"even at the lowest dose of a hundred milligrams, "
4539.15,"'cause, again, the range is a hundred to "
400,"milligrams, "
4541.19,that theanine gives them such vivid dreams 
4544.07,that they actually find it disruptive 
4546.35,where they wake up in the middle of the night 
4547.88,or they find that the sleep that they're getting 
4549.8,is kind of anxiety ridden 
4551.36,because of the intensity of those dreams. 
4553.13,So some people might choose to leave theanine 
4555.2,out of the sleep stack 
4556.37,and just take magnesium threonate or apigenin 
4558.227,"And again, some people might leave magnesium threonate "
4560.51,out of the sleep stack. 
4562.76,"Again, all of this is really about finding "
4565.22,the supplementation protocol that's ideal for you. 
4568.04,I should mention that whether or not 
4569.3,you're taking one or two or three of the components 
4571.79,"of the sleep stack, "
4573.62,the ideal time to take those 
4574.75,is 
30,to 
60,"minutes before bedtime, "
4577.1,especially if you haven't had anything to eat 
4579.11,for the three hours or so before bedtime. 
4581.06,I confess that oftentimes 
4582.53,"I'll have a little bit of a snack late in the evening, "
4584.12,some berries or something. 
4585.56,"I try not to eat too close to bedtime, "
4587.42,"but some evenings just because of work schedule, "
4589.31,"I'll get home late, be "
9:,
00,"p.m., "
4591.29,and I'll eat a big meal 
4592.34,and then I'll take the sleep stack and fall asleep. 
4594.41,"Every once in a while, that just so happens. "
4596.42,Nobody's perfect. Certainly I'm not. 
4599.27,But that sleep stack can be very beneficial. 
4601.88,And I do think that it's preferable to melatonin. 
4604.67,Here's the reason. 
4605.503,"First of all, melatonin is a hormone "
4607.28,that you endogenously make. 
4608.6,You now know a lot about melatonin 
4610.25,"and it's controlled by light, "
4612.02,"meaning light inhibits it or eliminates it, "
4614.75,darkness promotes it. 
4616.91,"And melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, "
4621.11,but the dosages of melatonin 
4622.7,that are contained in most commercial products 
4624.44,"is far, far, far greater "
4627.02,than what we would make endogenously. 
4628.25,So it's really supraphysiological. 
4630.89,So that's of concern 
4631.82,because melatonin is not just responsible 
4634.46,for making us sleepy and fall asleep. 
4636.86,It also does things 
4638.118,"like interacts with other hormone systems, "
4641.03,"testosterone and estrogen, "
4642.11,"even in the puberty system, in kids. "
4644.747,Is taking melatonin every once in a while a problem 
4647.69,"for adjusting to jet lag, et cetera? "
4649.67,Probably not. I would even say no. 
4651.83,"But taking it chronically over time, "
4653.93,"especially kids taking it chronically over time, "
4656.48,can potentially be problematic. 
4658.01,"So at least in my opinion, these other supplements "
4660.23,are going to be preferable to melatonin. 
4662.69,"Now, as I mentioned in the beginning of today's episode, "
4664.73,there are some other things 
4666.08,that I certainly take every once in a while 
4667.939,and that other people might consider taking 
4670.729,in addition to the sleep stack I talked about before 
4673.91,or in place of that sleep stack 
4675.74,if that sleep stack doesn't work well for them. 
4677.57,"So every third or fourth night, "
4679.04,I will take two grams of glycine 
4681.71,and a hundred milligrams of GABA 
4683.69,in addition to the standard sleep stack 
4686.54,that I talked about before. 
4687.5,"So I'm taking mag threonate, apigenin, and theanine, "
4689.801,"and then I will also take two grams of glycine and GABA, "
4692.24,which I find greatly enhances my ability to get into sleep. 
4696.08,But the reason I only add glycine and GABA 
4699.41,every third or fourth night 
4701.0,"is that if I take it too often, "
4702.5,I find that the entire sleep stack 
4704.09,doesn't work quite as effectively. 
4705.59,"I don't know exactly why this is the case, "
4707.21,"but in any event, that's what I do. "
4709.91,"And more recently, I've also started using inositol, "
4713.6,in particular myo-inositol. 
4715.76,"Every other night, I'll take "
900,milligrams of myo-inositol 
4719.33,"in addition to mag threonate, apigenin, and theanine, "
4722.6,and not on the nights when I take glycine and GABA. 
4726.62,So I'm adding 
900,milligrams of inositol 
4728.57,to the standard sleep stack 
4730.46,"of mag threonate, theanine, and apigenin. "
4732.89,And what I find is not only does it greatly enhance 
4736.31,"my ability to fall asleep quickly, "
4738.11,"but if I wake up in the middle of the night, "
4739.79,"which I often do to use the bathroom, "
4742.58,"I find it very, very easy to fall back asleep. "
4745.49,"Whereas when I don't take inositol every other night or so, "
4750.29,"I find that if I wake up in the middle of the night, "
4751.76,it's a bit more of a challenge to fall back asleep. 
4754.37,So inositol has a number of different uses 
4756.95,that have been discussed in terms of mental health 
4759.56,and in terms of adjusting anxiety for its daytime use. 
4762.74,What I'm talking about 
4763.573,is taking 
900,milligrams of myo-inositol 
4766.07,also 
30,to 
60,minutes before sleep 
4768.17,along with the standard sleep stack 
4769.43,and I found that to be immensely beneficial. 
4771.5,I also noticed that it has a pretty long tail 
4774.17,of anxiety suppression throughout the day. 
4777.23,"And I'm not somebody who suffers from anxiety, "
4779.66,but I have to say it just has led me 
4781.76,"to feel a bit calmer throughout the day, "
4783.53,and I don't really know how to say this 
4785.45,"except in subjective terms, "
4786.56,to feel a bit more buffered against 
4788.54,or resilient against stress events. 
4790.43,And if you look at the literature on inositol 
4792.59,and its interactions 
4793.49,"with the serotonin system and other systems, "
4796.19,that all makes sense as to why that would be the case. 
4798.32,"So we'll provide links to our so-called sleep kit, "
4800.42,which is part of our Neural Network Newsletter. 
4802.25,It's a zero-cost newsletter 
4803.36,where you can access this information about supplements 
4805.82,and other behavioral tools for sleep in list form. 
4808.61,But that sleep kit doesn't include 
4810.44,some of the newer information 
4811.46,"that I've provided this episode, "
4812.72,"in particular, the information about inositol "
4815.21,and what I'm finding 
4816.043,to be the very beneficial use of inositol 
4819.8,for the ability to fall back asleep 
4822.23,"after waking up in the middle of the night, "
4823.58,which is something that a lot of people struggle with. 
4825.65,"Now, that's supplementation for falling and staying asleep, "
4828.32,but we can return to the behavioral tools 
4831.53,also as powerful levers and tools 
4833.84,for falling asleep and getting back to sleep. 
4836.54,"And again, we look to NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, "
4840.32,or the Reveri app as a way to do that. 
4842.87,"As I mentioned earlier, "
4843.703,the Reveri app has been developed on the basis 
4846.83,"of really high-quality, peer-reviewed research, "
4849.23,"both clinical and non-clinical, "
4851.39,"by my colleague, David Spiegel, "
4852.86,who's our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford. 
4855.14,It's a wonderful tool. 
4856.55,It does carry a cost after the initial seven-day trial. 
4860.39,I can tell you what the cost on that is 
4862.522,so you can get a sense 
4864.98,"because I do realize that anything that carries a cost, "
4867.59,"for some people, it won't be accessible. "
4869.42,"Right now, Reveri, "
4871.01,"and I should just mention, "
4871.91,they didn't pay us for an ad read. 
4873.17,I'm just telling you what they told me 
4874.67,so that I can accurately report what it costs to use Reveri. 
4879.38,They have a monthly subscription 
4881.03,to use the Reveri app at 
14.99.,
4883.22,You do get the seven-day free trial. 
4885.05,They have a yearly subscription of 
99.99,
4888.17,with a seven-day free trial. 
4889.25,"And they have a lifetime purchase, one-time purchase, "
4891.41,of 
249,with no trial. 
4893.3,"It right now is only available for Apple, not for Android, "
4896.12,"but they are, yes, going to have it available "
4898.19,for Android soon. 
4899.57,There's a signup list there. 
4901.34,"I should mention that while the cost might seem high, "
4905.36,"if you compare that cost to, say, supplements, "
4907.78,"or you compare that cost to a poor night's sleep over time, "
4910.67,"the cost, at least to me, seems somewhat modest, "
4914.42,certainly within range for a number of people. 
4916.34,"But I acknowledge not within range for other people, "
4919.04,which is why I also want to point to zero-cost tools 
4922.88,"and the zero-cost tool for getting asleep, staying asleep, "
4926.12,and falling back asleep 
4927.56,is going to be NSDR. 
4929.66,We'll put a link to a non-sleep deep rest protocol 
4931.55,"that's available on YouTube, "
4932.57,so available to anybody zero cost 
4934.4,provided you have a internet connection. 
4936.83,"Again, dim the screen "
4937.79,if you're going to turn that on late at night. 
4939.29,And there are a number of other yoga nidra scripts 
4942.68,"and apps and sources around the internet, "
4945.62,"in particular, on YouTube, "
4946.46,that are zero cost that you could use 
4948.35,if the Reveri app is outside your price range 
4950.66,"or is not preferable to you, et cetera. "
4954.05,"When I wake up in the middle of the night, "
4955.43,it's usually to use the restroom. 
4956.57,I'll go use the restroom. 
4957.403,I'll keep the lights as dim as possible. 
4958.88,I'll get back into bed. 
4960.26,"And if I find that it's easy to fall asleep, "
4962.39,"great, I'm asleep. "
4963.53,"And if not, then I will generally plug in the Reveri app. "
4966.56,"They have a fall back asleep hypnosis, "
4968.701,and 
99,"times out of a hundred, "
4971.69,I'm back asleep within minutes 
4973.16,and I don't wake up until morning. 
4974.66,"Now, very briefly, I just want to touch on some tools "
4977.12,"that are very commonly used by many people out there, "
4979.22,"and believe it or not, "
4980.06,there is peer-reviewed science on things like eye masks. 
4983.03,Do eye masks improve your ability to stay asleep? 
4985.97,"And indeed, they do, "
4987.44,provided they are not too tight 
4989.15,and provided that the room is cool enough. 
4991.88,Why? 
4992.713,"Well, eye masks cover the upper half of your face, "
4994.55,which is where glabrous skin is localized. 
4997.61,"Remember, palms of the hands, bottoms of the feet, "
4999.29,glabrous skin on the face. 
5001.03,So a lot of people who wear eye masks will wake up 
5003.7,because they're too warm if the room is too warm. 
5005.62,"So if you're going to use an eye mask to keep light out, "
5008.65,definitely make sure the room 
5010.12,and your sleeping environment and your bed are cool enough 
5012.7,in order for you to stay asleep. 
5014.32,"In addition, I get a lot of questions about earplugs. "
5016.78,Here's the deal with earplugs. 
5018.07,Some people find that earplugs are very beneficial 
5019.99,"because, of course, they prevent the entrance of sound "
5023.83,into the ear that could wake us up. 
5025.72,But some people find that the sound 
5027.64,of their own beating of their own heart can be disruptive 
5030.82,and they get a sort of humming in their head 
5032.77,when they have those earplugs in. 
5034.54,I'm one such person. 
5035.47,"Although, I have family members "
5036.76,that like using earplugs when they sleep. 
5038.47,So it's really up to you. 
5039.67,You have to see whether or not those earplugs help 
5042.25,or disrupt your sleep. 
5043.66,"For me, they're no good. "
5045.25,"For some people, they really enjoy them. "
5046.93,I don't use an eye mask 
5048.22,unless I'm sleeping in a really bright environment 
5050.01,or I need to sleep on a plane and things of that sort. 
5053.65,Other tools that I'll just mention 
5054.563,that have peer-reviewed research to support them. 
5057.64,Elevating your feet either with a pillow 
5059.5,or by elevating the end of your bed 
5061.6,by about three to five degrees 
5063.34,can be really beneficial for increasing the depth of sleep 
5066.37,because of the so-called glymphatic washout. 
5068.44,This is the movement of and circulation of fluids 
5070.78,in your brain at night 
5073.09,that lead to more wakefulness 
5074.53,and actually can improve cognitive function 
5076.45,and a number of other things related to brain health. 
5079.27,There's one caveat to that. 
5080.71,"For people that suffer from acid reflux, "
5083.05,having your ankles elevated above your chest 
5085.96,or above your heart in the middle of the night 
5087.61,can actually exacerbate that acid reflux. 
5089.89,You want to do the opposite. 
5091.03,You want to actually elevate the head side of your bed 
5094.09,by about three to five degrees. 
5095.56,"Now, one of the common causes of sleep disruption "
5098.08,that has tremendously detrimental effects 
5100.9,is so-called sleep apnea. 
5102.52,So this is basically bouts of suffocation 
5105.16,or lack of oxygenation during sleep. 
5107.35,This is particularly the case 
5108.91,"for people that are very heavyset, "
5110.5,"and that heavyset could be from obesity, "
5112.06,it could also be heavyset from having too much muscle. 
5114.55,A lot of people who are carrying too much muscle 
5117.01,will actually have sleep apnea without realizing it. 
5119.11,Sleep apnea is actually very dangerous. 
5121.27,It's associated with a number of cardiovascular issues. 
5123.82,It's associated with sexual dysfunction. 
5125.41,It's associated with issues with cognition. 
5127.78,Sleep apnea is bad. 
5128.74,"A lot of people will have to use the PAP, "
5130.78,"which is a, it's a device. "
5132.61,It looks like a sort of like a snorkel mask or a dive mask. 
5136.24,It's a whole apparatus that people will go to sleep with. 
5140.14,"However, many people can relieve themselves of sleep apnea "
5143.65,provided it's not too serious 
5144.76,"and can sleep much better, "
5146.5,"in fact, I think all people can sleep much better, "
5148.36,if they train themselves 
5149.77,to be nose breathers while they sleep. 
5152.26,There are a lot of reasons to be a nose breather 
5153.88,unless you are breathing very hard due to exercise 
5156.94,or talking or eating. 
5158.74,"That was all covered in James Nestor's book, "
5160.997,"""Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art."" "
5162.91,It's been covered in a number of different podcasts. 
5164.83,We've talked about it on this podcast as well. 
5167.47,It's a good idea to be a nose breather 
5168.88,unless you need to mouth breathe. 
5170.47,"And it's a great idea, it's a superb idea, "
5172.99,to be a nose breather in sleep. 
5175.99,And one way to really get good at that 
5177.6,is to take a little bit of medical tape 
5179.08,and to tape your mouth shut before going to sleep. 
5181.36,You heard me right. 
5182.193,Put some medical tape over your mouth 
5183.82,and force yourself to nose breathe during sleep. 
5186.07,It also prevents snoring in most cases. 
5188.83,Really offsets sleep apnea. 
5191.65,"Sleep apnea, again, being a very serious health concern. "
5194.89,I should also mention as a tool 
5196.78,"that if you have a hard time being a nose breather in sleep, "
5199.93,"you can try doing your cardiovascular exercise, "
5202.48,"at least the lower-intensity cardiovascular exercise, "
5205.27,through purely nasal breathing. 
5207.49,"And one way to do that, again, is to tape your mouth shut "
5209.95,"or put a gulp of water in your mouth, "
5211.18,"but don't actually swallow that mouth full of water, "
5214.33,or to use a mouthpiece 
5216.04,or just deliberately keep your mouth closed 
5218.17,and insist on breathing through your nose. 
5220.0,Most people find 
5220.833,"that when they start doing cardiovascular exercise that way, "
5222.94,"it's really challenging at first, "
5224.95,"but over time, they actually can feel quite calm "
5227.44,and still can generate a lot of physical effort 
5229.99,purely using nose breathing. 
5232.24,The reason that doing nose breathing 
5233.83,during cardiovascular exercise 
5235.27,translates to being a nose breather during sleep 
5237.64,"is that your sinuses actually can dilate, they're plastic, "
5241.03,"and over time, "
5241.863,"plastic meaning they're malleable that is, "
5245.23,and they can become wider. 
5246.67,You're not going to get giant nostrils. Don't worry about it. 
5248.53,"Your airways within your skull, "
5251.38,"'cause that's what the sinuses really are, "
5253.06,"these little passages within the skull, "
5254.83,"and, of course, within the nasal passages, "
5256.75,will dilate and will allow you 
5258.91,to breathe more easily through your nose. 
5260.26,But for those of you 
5261.37,that are waking up in the middle of the night 
5262.96,breathing on your back [breathing heavily] 
5264.91,or your partner is telling you that 
5266.2,or other people are telling you that 
5267.3,or you're that person on the plane 
5268.54,with your mouth hanging open and drooling 
5270.22,"and your mouth breathing, "
5271.87,"terrible, terrible, terrible for health reasons "
5273.97,"and other reasons, "
5274.81,"put some a medical tape over your mouth, "
5276.49,learn to be a nose breather during sleep. 
5278.29,Your sleep will improve 
5279.52,and your daytime feelings 
5281.23,"of wakefulness and focus will improve, "
5282.91,"your cardiovascular health will improve, "
5285.13,and on and on and on. 
5286.21,So now we've largely covered the tools that one could use 
5288.94,"to get and stay asleep, "
5290.74,"and we talked about exercise, "
5291.82,"we talked about temperature, "
5292.75,"we talked about supplements, "
5294.58,"and we talked about, of course, "
5295.51,keeping the sleeping environment 
5297.22,both cool and as dark as possible. 
5300.82,I do want to mention a couple of broad contour tools 
5304.36,that will impact your ability 
5306.07,to sleep really well on a consistent basis 
5308.59,and the one that impacts the most number of people 
5310.78,is weekends. 
5313.0,Turns out that most everybody feels the impulse 
5315.64,"to sleep in on the weekend, "
5316.9,especially if they've been out late the night before. 
5318.97,"However, the data show "
5320.74,that keeping relatively consistent sleep and wake times 
5324.28,is really going to enhance 
5325.63,the quality and depth of your sleep. 
5327.88,"So if you stay out late one night, "
5330.01,"sure, you might allow yourself "
5331.3,"to sleep in an extra hour or so, "
5332.92,but you should really try to avoid sleeping in longer 
5336.79,than an hour beyond your normal wake-up time. 
5340.27,That's right. 
5341.103,If you normally get eight hours of sleep 
5342.64,and you wake up at 
7:,
00,"a.m., "
5344.8,probably okay to wake up at 
8:,
00,a.m. on the weekend 
5348.25,"or after a night out the night before, "
5350.83,but try not to sleep until 
11,or noon 
5353.14,thinking that you're going to catch up on your sleep 
5355.06,or that's better than waking up at a consistent time. 
5357.43,It would be better to wake up at a consistent time 
5359.47,plus or minus an hour 
5360.64,and get a nap in the afternoon 
5362.08,"provided that nap, again, isn't too long. "
5365.14,And the other tool 
5366.52,that relates to nights that you stayed out too late 
5368.86,or that you feel like you want to sleep in a bit more 
5371.77,in the morning 
5372.603,is if you are going to wake up at your consistent time. 
5376.15,"So for example, normally you go to bed at "
10,
5379.18,and you wake up at six. 
5380.23,Let's say that's your schedule. 
5382.33,And you end up staying up late one night 
5384.25,until midnight or one for whatever reason 
5386.829,and the next morning you wake up at seven 
5389.32,and you're still groggy. 
5391.54,"In that case, you absolutely want to wait "
5394.15,to ingest caffeine 
90,to 
120,minutes after waking. 
5397.48,You really do because there are good data 
5399.54,to support the fact that caffeine can disrupt sleep. 
5403.81,"Yes, that's obvious. "
5405.01,Caffeine especially disrupts sleep 
5406.99,if you take it too late in the day. 
5408.91,That's very obvious as to why that would be the case. 
5411.52,But caffeine especially disrupts 
5414.46,what's called compensatory sleep. 
5416.65,So if you start changing your waking time 
5419.56,and your to sleep time 
5420.94,and you start using additional caffeine 
5423.19,to offset the sleepiness that you're experiencing 
5425.32,"because of those late nights out, "
5426.82,"well, that's when you really start to disrupt "
5428.92,"not just your nighttime sleep, "
5430.36,"but your daytime compensatory sleep, so those naps. "
5432.61,You also are disrupting the total architecture of sleep 
5436.21,in the early morning hours. 
5437.41,"There's a lot of great science that's been put to this, "
5440.23,"or that's emerged from this, I should say. "
5442.18,So try and keep those sleep-wake times relatively constant 
5445.39,"plus or minus an hour, "
5446.47,and try as much as you can to delay that caffeine intake 
5450.43,
90,to 
120,"minutes after waking every day, "
5452.98,but especially on days where you wake up 
5455.23,and you feel you haven't gotten enough sleep. 
5456.61,"In that case, I highly recommend "
5458.17,you just use NSDR or the Reveri app 
5460.78,or some other form of deep relaxation 
5463.51,"to try and compensate for the lack of sleep, "
5466.69,"knowing, of course, that there's no complete compensation "
5470.59,for lack of sleep. 
5471.423,There are just things that we can do 
5472.63,to partially offset lack of sleep. 
5474.82,"Now, a couple of final points and additional tools "
5477.28,"that I think are going to be useful to everybody, "
5479.77,"in particular, people who have young children "
5482.71,or are following a shift work schedule 
5485.47,or who are experiencing jet lag. 
5488.56,"Keep in mind, jet lag can be due to travel, "
5491.26,"which is obvious, "
5492.093,but jet lag can also be due 
5493.57,"to getting woken up in the middle of the night, right? "
5495.67,Your body doesn't know the difference 
5496.72,between flying to a new time zone 
5498.85,and getting woken up in the middle of the night. 
5501.01,The tool that I'd like to offer you 
5502.26,is an understanding of something called temperature minimum. 
5505.24,And I'm going to make this as simple as possible 
5506.95,and I'm confident that everyone can understand this 
5509.08,even if you don't have any science background. 
5511.99,Here's the question you need to ask yourself. 
5514.45,"What is your typical wake-up time, okay? "
5518.2,What's your typical wake-up time? 
5519.31,"If for you, your typical wake-up time is "
7:,
00,a.m. 
5521.95,"plus or minus half an hour, "
5524.17,and that could be 
7:,
00,a.m. 
5525.13,because you set an alarm clock 
5526.45,or it could be 
7:,
00,a.m. 
5527.38,because you naturally wake up at 
7:,
00,"a.m., doesn't matter, "
5530.05,if your typical wake-up time most days is 
7:,
00,"a.m., "
5533.71,"well, then your temperature minimum is "
5:,
00,a.m. 
5536.59,"That's right, your temperature minimum is not a temperature. "
5538.96,It's a time within your 
24-hour,cycle. 
5542.89,"Approximately two hours before your typical wake-up time, "
5546.13,your body is at its lowest temperature 
5548.56,that it will ever be in the 
24-hour,cycle. 
5551.05,That's why it's called your temperature minimum. 
5553.45,Here's what you need to know about your temperature minimum. 
5555.67,"If you view bright light, exercise, or drink caffeine "
5560.62,or all of the above 
5562.24,"in the two to four hours before your temperature minimum, "
5567.4,that will delay your clock. 
5569.56,What that means when I say delay your clock 
5571.42,is it will make you want to go to sleep later 
5574.12,"and wake up later the next night, okay? "
5576.79,"So let's run this exercise for you, "
5578.77,the person waking up at 
7:,
00,"a.m. on a regular basis, "
5582.04,I can predict with almost certainty 
5584.47,that your body is going to be at its lowest temperature 
5587.41,at 
5:,
00,a.m.. 
5588.7,So what that means 
5589.96,is that if you get up at 
3:,
00,a.m. or at 
4:,
00,a.m. 
5594.46,and you flip on bright lights in your house 
5596.62,or in your bathroom 
5597.82,or you have a cup of coffee 
5598.99,or you do any kind of exercise 
5600.31,"or you get up and head to the airport, "
5602.77,the mechanisms in your brain and body 
5605.26,that control timing of sleep 
5606.79,and timing of waking will shift. 
5608.2,They will delay. 
5609.34,It's as if you put your clock on hold for a little while 
5612.49,"and then let it start again, okay? "
5614.17,That's the simplest way I can describe it. 
5615.73,And you will tend to want to go to sleep later 
5618.67,and wake up later the following night. 
5621.49,"Now, the opposite is true "
5623.65,"if you view bright light, drink caffeine, "
5627.04,"or exercise or socialize, I should say, "
5630.04,in the hours immediately after your temperature minimum. 
5633.76,"So for you in this example, "
5635.62,the person who's waking up at 
7:,
00,"a.m., "
5637.45,your temperature minimum is 
5:,
00,"a.m., "
5639.28,"if you view bright light, exercise, "
5641.11,"maybe have a snack, maybe not, or socialize, move about, "
5644.984,at 
5:,
30,or 
6:,
00,a.m. or 
7:,
00,a.m. 
5648.58,That will tend to phase advance your clock. 
5652.33,It will tend to basically make you 
5654.4,want to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier 
5657.19,the following night. 
5658.15,"Now, I used this example "
5659.17,of a person who wakes up typically at 
7:,
00,a.m. 
5661.39,whose temperature minimum is 
5:,
00,"a.m., "
5662.98,"but, of course, you need to adjust that for yourself "
5665.71,if you're somebody who wakes up at 
9:,
00,a.m. 
5666.607,or at 
5:,
00,a.m. et cetera. 
5668.71,Why do I offer this as a tool? 
5670.06,"Well, this is an immensely powerful tool "
5672.55,"if, for instance, you are headed to a time zone "
5674.74,where you need to go to bed earlier 
5676.03,and wake up earlier once you arrive in that time zone. 
5678.73,"What it means is in the day or two before you leave, "
5681.52,"you can force yourself to exercise, drink caffeine, "
5686.5,"maybe even to eat a meal early in the morning, "
5688.99,or maybe you still fast early in the morning 
5690.307,"and that's really up to you, "
5691.75,but you force yourself to do the activities 
5694.54,that are going to phase advance your clock. 
5697.39,Whereas if you're traveling to a time zone 
5699.28,where you are going to need to go to sleep much later 
5702.13,and you're going to need to wake up much later 
5705.04,"or even a little bit later, "
5706.33,you can do those things 
5707.44,in the hours prior to your temperature minimum. 
5710.74,"Now, for those of you that work shift work, "
5712.51,"this can be especially useful, "
5714.34,but I want to say a couple of things about shift work. 
5717.52,There are a lot of details about shift work and jet lag 
5719.65,in an episode that I did 
5720.85,specifically about jet lag and shift work. 
5722.86,"So for the deep dive, go there, "
5724.15,"but suffice to say this for now, "
5727.57,"if you are going to do shift work, "
5729.16,try to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time. 
5732.04,"It's very detrimental to brain and body, "
5734.35,it can even be horrifically challenging 
5737.74,"for your brain and body in a number of ways, "
5739.51,"if you are switching on the so-called swing shift, "
5742.42,"you know, you're working three days the night shift, "
5743.89,"three days the day shift, "
5744.723,"three days the night shift, three days the... "
5745.99,Try and stay on the same schedule as much as possible. 
5749.02,"And I should say for everybody, "
5750.94,"people who are jet lagged and engaged in shift work or not, "
5754.84,"but just for everybody, "
5755.92,if you need to be awake in the middle of your sleep cycle 
5759.7,and it's not just a quick departure to the bathroom 
5762.22,"and back to bed, "
5763.48,"but you really need to be awake, "
5764.56,"you know, you're feeding a baby "
5765.79,or you're taking care of a loved one 
5768.16,or you need to do something that's critical 
5769.57,"or you need to work, "
5770.403,"if possible, use red light, okay? "
5773.02,"Now, for shift workers who really are trying "
5775.39,"to stay awake all night and sleep all day, "
5777.49,"this is not going to be ideal, "
5778.84,"but for people that, for instance, "
5780.61,need to stay up really late one night 
5782.02,"or wake up especially early, like "
3:,
00,"a.m., "
5784.12,to prepare for an exam that you're just not ready for 
5786.52,"or to head to the airport, et cetera, "
5789.34,using red light has been shown 
5791.08,to allow people to be awake enough 
5793.27,and obviously see what they need to see 
5794.8,in order to perform their activities safely 
5797.08,but it does not seem to disrupt the cortisol rhythm 
5800.68,"that is the healthy, normal cortisol rhythm. "
5803.35,"Now, I realize this is kind of an advanced tool "
5805.36,and many people won't have access to this. 
5806.92,There are a number of different sources for red lights now. 
5810.04,Companies like Joovv or KOZE light. 
5813.01,These are different brands. 
5814.12,I don't have any affiliation 
5815.14,"to any of these brands, I should say. "
5816.34,There are a number of different 
5817.6,red light bulb sources out there and commercial sources 
5821.23,that you can explore if you want. 
5822.7,But understanding this temperature minimum 
5824.74,is really powerful 
5826.15,because it allows you to adjust your schedule 
5827.92,"depending on travel, "
5828.79,depending on changing work schedules or school schedules. 
5831.52,"And if you're not a morning person, "
5832.87,you can use the tools related to temperature minimum 
5835.63,"to really become a morning person over time, "
5838.57,and it actually is pretty easy. 
5840.13,And I talked about this in a previous episode 
5842.35,but I'll just mention that there have been shown 
5844.3,"to be important, positive effects on cognition, "
5847.24,"on even grip strength and physical performance, "
5849.67,"for people that are early morning risers, "
5852.88,and that's especially true for night owls 
5855.43,that deliberately shift themselves to become early risers. 
5858.7,"Okay, so that's a lot of information and a lot of tools "
5860.887,and I suppose the one set of tools 
5862.63,"that I really didn't drill into too deeply, "
5865.27,the ones related to jet lag and shift work. 
5867.07,"And again, please check out the episode "
5869.23,on jet lag and shift work if that's relevant to you. 
5872.14,But I think for most people who are going to sleep at night 
5875.92,and are trying their best to sleep well at night 
5878.5,and are trying their best 
5879.55,to wake up in the morning at whatever hour 
5881.56,"and stay alert and focused throughout the day, "
5883.3,"maybe with a brief nap, "
5884.83,the tools that I talked about today 
5886.09,"related to light, temperature, food, exercise, "
5889.06,"caffeine, supplements, and digital tools, "
5892.39,I'm hoping will prove to be very useful for you. 
5895.42,They certainly are all supported 
5897.25,by excellent peer-reviewed research. 
5899.5,And I should just emphasize again 
5901.06,that most of the tools we talked about 
5902.59,are completely zero cost. 
5904.51,So while the supplements and some of the digital tools 
5906.94,"do carry some cost to them, "
5909.07,I really want to encourage everybody 
5910.39,to get your behaviors right. 
5912.25,Get all of the things related to your timing of exercise 
5915.28,and type of exercise 
5916.806,in the best possible order and time of day. 
5920.17,We talked about this critical period early in the day 
5922.45,and then another critical period in the middle of the day 
5924.46,and the late afternoon 
5925.39,and then this third critical period 
5926.59,in the middle of the night. 
5927.55,Different tools for the different three critical periods. 
5930.395,"I promise that if you start to implement some, "
5932.905,"or ideally, all of these tools, "
5935.47,the quality of your sleep will increase tremendously. 
5938.38,"And of course, in doing so, "
5940.36,the quality of your daytime alertness 
5942.13,and your ability to focus will improve tremendously. 
5944.56,"Again, sleep is the absolute foundation "
5948.49,"of your mental health, your physical health, "
5950.32,and your performance in all endeavors. 
5952.27,So if there's one area of your life 
5954.94,"to really focus on and try and optimize, "
5957.7,if your goal is to be happier and more productive 
5960.1,"and just to have a better life overall, "
5962.95,I can confidently say 
5964.36,that sleep is really the thing to optimize.
