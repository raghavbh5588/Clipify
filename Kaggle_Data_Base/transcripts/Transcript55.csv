0.34,"- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, "
2.02,where we discuss science and science-based tools 
4.93,for everyday life. 
5.763,[upbeat music] 
9.27,"I'm Andrew Huberman, "
10.18,and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology 
12.93,at Stanford School of Medicine. 
14.81,"Today, we are going to talk about the psychology "
17.0,"and the biology of desire, love and attachment. "
21.13,"Today happens to be Valentine's day, "2022.,
24.63,"However, the themes we are going to discuss "
27.03,"pertain to desire, love and attachment on any given day. "
30.8,And indeed the mechanisms we are going to discuss 
33.29,"almost certainly were at play thousands of years ago, "
36.13,"hundreds of years ago, and no doubt will still be at play "
39.5,"in our minds, and in our bodies, and in our psychologies "
42.42,"for the decades, centuries and thousands of years to come. "
45.74,"Indeed today, I want to focus on core mechanisms "
49.03,that lead individuals to seek out other individuals 
52.33,"with whom to mate with, "
54.62,"with whom to have children with or not, "
57.14,with whom to enter short 
58.65,"or long-term relationships with, "
60.67,and for perhaps to end those relationships 
63.22,"or to seek relationships on the side, so-called infidelity. "
66.5,I'm certainly not going to encourage or discourage 
68.4,any of these behaviors. 
69.35,I'm simply going to cover the peer-reviewed scientific data 
72.73,"on all these aspects of desire, love, and attachment. "
76.87,"I'm going to discuss how our childhood attachment styles, "
80.3,"as they're called, influence our adult attachment styles. "
84.78,"Yes, you heard that right. "
86.01,How we attached or did not attach to primary caregivers 
90.7,in our childhood has much to do with how we attach 
95.34,"or fail to attach to romantic partners as adults, "
99.08,"because the same neural circuits, "
101.95,the neurons and their connections in the brain and body 
104.44,"that underlie attachment between infant and caregiver, "
107.77,"between toddler and parent or other caregiver, "
110.4,and during adolescence and in our teenage years 
113.21,are repurposed for adult romantic attachments. 
117.11,"I know that might be a little eerie to think about, "
119.27,but indeed that is true. 
121.03,Now the fortunate thing is that regardless of our childhood 
124.18,"attachment styles and experiences, the neural circuits "
127.84,"for desire, love and attachment are quite plastic. "
131.35,They are amenable to change in response to both 
134.27,what we think and what we feel as well as what we do. 
138.6,"However, all three aspects that we're discussing today, "
142.08,"desire, love and attachment "
144.09,are also strongly biologically driven. 
147.03,We're going to talk about biological mechanisms 
149.55,"such as hormones, "
151.11,"biological mechanisms such as neurochemicals, "
153.36,"things like dopamine, oxytocin and serotonin, "
156.31,"and neural circuits, brain areas, and indeed areas "
159.91,of the body that interact with the brain that control 
162.93,"whether or not we desire somebody or not, "
165.18,whether or not we lose or increase our desire 
167.41,"for somebody over time, whether or not we fall in love, "
171.01,"what love means, and whether or not the relationships "
174.0,we form continue to include the elements 
176.8,of desire and love over time or not. 
179.71,In order to illustrate just how powerfully our biology 
182.15,can shape our perception of the attractiveness 
184.09,"of other people, I want to share with you the results "
186.49,of a couple of studies. 
187.91,Both studies explore 
189.29,how people rate other people's attractiveness. 
192.19,"And in both studies, the major variable is that women "
196.29,are at different stages of their menstrual cycle. 
198.87,"Now in the first study, men are rating the attractiveness "
202.48,of women according to the smell of those women. 
205.41,Now they're not smelling them directly. 
206.81,They're smelling clothing that women wore for a couple 
209.87,of days at different phases of their menstrual cycle. 
212.9,And what they find is that men will rate the odors of women 
216.31,as most attractive if those women wore 
219.4,"those shirts, that clothing, "
221.8,"in the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle, okay? "
224.81,So this is not to say that men do not find women attractive 
228.54,at other stages of their cycle. 
229.801,It is to say that men find women's odors 
233.47,"particularly attractive, if those odors were worn by women "
237.54,that are in the pre-ovulatory phase 
239.72,"of their menstrual cycle, okay? "
242.21,"Now, there was also a study that was done where women "
245.85,at different stages of their menstrual cycle 
247.099,are rating the odors of men. 
249.97,And a similar but mirror symmetric result was found 
253.42,such that women who are in the pre-ovulatory phase 
256.29,of their menstrual cycle will rate men's odors 
259.53,as more attractive than at other stages of their cycle. 
263.45,So the simple way to put this is that there seems 
265.81,to be something special about the pre-ovulatory phase 
268.71,of a woman's menstrual cycle that makes men rate them 
271.52,as more attractive during that time and women rate men 
275.26,as more attractive during that particular time as well. 
278.51,So this is a bidirectional effect. 
281.41,"The way that the second study was done, "
283.66,where women are rating men was not just to smell the odors 
287.46,"of those men on t-shirts, they did that, "
290.2,but they correlated that with whether or not 
292.37,the shirts were worn by men 
293.69,that were particularly physically symmetrical. 
296.66,They actually had these men divided into groups. 
298.67,"It was more of a continuum rather, "
300.29,rated according to body symmetry and face symmetry. 
303.55,And women preferred more symmetrical men 
307.07,when they were doing the preference test 
309.81,during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle. 
312.44,"So again, the point is that that pre-ovulatory "
313.828,phase of the cycle seems to create 
316.01,a bidirectional mutual attractiveness. 
319.41,"Now, also extremely interesting is that this effect "
322.01,does really seem to have something to do with ovulation. 
325.24,"Because in both studies, "
327.44,they had women that were taking oral contraception or not. 
330.37,And what they found was if a woman is taking 
333.18,"oral contraception, it prevented that peak and perceived "
336.55,"attractiveness by the men, meaning men no longer perceived "
341.43,a woman to be more attractive 
343.18,at a particular phase of their cycle. 
345.31,And also women taking oral contraception no longer preferred 
349.38,the odors of more symmetrical men 
351.73,during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle. 
354.19,"Now, I want to make sure that it's especially clear "
357.17,that it is not the case that oral contraception reduced 
361.43,"the perception of a woman as attractive, "
363.52,that did not happen in these studies. 
365.33,It reduced the further increase in a male's perception 
369.53,of her as attractive. 
370.58,"And if women took oral contraception, "
373.23,it prevented them from preferring more symmetrical men 
378.12,based on the odors of those men. 
380.15,Now I realize there are a lot of variables here. 
381.68,"We've got odors, we've got symmetry, "
382.783,"we've got menstrual cycle, pre-ovulatory, non pre-ovulatory. "
386.24,And we have whether or not people 
388.21,are taking contraception or not. 
389.71,But the basic finding is that depending on where women are 
392.68,"in their menstrual cycle, influences both men's perception "
395.81,of them as attractive and their perception of men 
399.45,as attractive and oral contraception eliminates that effect. 
403.39,So I share with you those data to illustrate that 
406.35,"we often think that somebody is attractive or not based on, "
410.5,"I don't know, how they look, "
412.39,"their skin, their hair, et cetera, "
414.53,but it also illustrates that their odor is a powerful cue 
418.4,for some people more than others. 
419.81,Some of us tend to be more factory driven than others. 
422.03,"Although if you watched the ""Huberman Lab Podcast"" episode "
424.76,that I did with Professor David Buss 
426.75,"from the University of Texas, Austin, "
428.55,who's a luminary in the field of evolutionary psychology 
432.38,and has studied mate choice 
434.01,"and mate selection bias over decades, "
436.44,"he's really one of the founders of that field, "
438.95,he emphasized findings that odor for many people 
443.22,is a maker or a deal breaker. 
446.29,"Meaning, there are some people that even if somebody has "
449.56,all the characteristics that they're looking for in terms 
452.17,"of kindness, and attractiveness, and values, "
454.56,and other features that would and should be 
457.08,"of very high priority in selecting a mate, "
459.49,"that if someone does not like the way that person smells, "
463.33,"their innate body odor independent of colognes, "
465.842,"and perfumes, and soaps, et cetera, "
468.5,that that's often a complete and total deal breaker. 
471.51,I'm sure there are some of you that can relate to that. 
473.25,And there's some of you perhaps for which that is 
475.76,"not the case, and you can't even imagine that being "
477.9,such a powerful variable. 
479.095,And yet the data suggested indeed it is a powerful variable 
483.46,for many people out there. 
484.88,"Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "
487.35,is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. 
490.13,"It is however, part of my desire and effort "
492.43,to bring zero cost to consumer information about science 
495.027,and science-related tools to the general public. 
497.8,"In keeping with that theme, "
498.87,I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. 
501.58,Our first sponsor is Thesis. 
503.51,Thesis makes custom nootropics. 
505.84,"Now nootropics is not a word that I'm usually a fan of, "
508.99,because nootropic means smart drug. 
511.42,And there are a lot of different aspects 
512.582,to being smart or to intelligence. 
515.04,There's the ability to focus. 
516.44,There's the ability to task switch. 
518.51,There's the ability to be creative. 
520.72,And each of those different forms of intelligence 
522.98,or expressions of intelligence involves 
524.94,"different brain circuits, different neurochemicals, "
527.22,and indeed different hormones in the body. 
530.37,So I think it's rather naive to think that 
532.38,there could be one smart drug or nootropic. 
534.85,Thesis understands this. 
535.969,And so they've developed custom nootropics that are tailored 
539.24,to the specific goals that you might have 
541.21,"in terms of cognitive work, or physical exercise, "
544.29,or skill learning of any kind. 
546.06,And they tailor them to the individual. 
548.46,"They only use the highest quality ingredients, "
550.86,many of which I've talked about here on the podcast. 
553.05,"Things like alpha GPC, which I personally use, "
555.3,"things like phosphatidylserine, "
556.754,which I also use on occasion. 
559.01,"However, they've taken different combinations "
561.16,of those ingredients and put them into different 
563.7,formulations designed for particular goals or endpoints. 
567.36,"For instance, I have Thesis nootropics "
569.68,"that are for motivation, others that are for clarity, "
573.93,"for mental clarity, others that I take pre-workout, "
577.07,"others that I take post-workout, and so on and so forth. "
580.41,"Now, in addition to that Thesis understands that "
583.32,not every ingredient is terrific for everybody. 
586.21,"In fact, one particular substance that I've talked about "
588.71,"on the podcast, Ginkgo biloba is very useful "
592.25,for a lot of people. 
593.17,"However, I don't tolerate it well. "
594.61,I get vicious headaches from Ginkgo biloba. 
596.71,So none of the formulations that they've made 
598.27,for me include Ginkgo biloba. 
600.55,"So again, these are custom nootropics that are tailored "
603.08,"for your particular goals, "
604.53,and where the ingredients really match 
606.51,"your particular needs, "
607.67,"and don't include things that aren't going to work for you, "
610.42,or that create things like headaches. 
612.63,So the personalization and the targeted effects 
615.04,of the nootropics is really where or the power comes from. 
617.23,I've been using Thesis nootropics 
619.07,for close to six months now. 
620.45,And I can confidently say that their nootropics 
622.77,have been a total game changer for me. 
624.75,My go-to formula is the motivation formula. 
628.16,"If I'm going to be training, or working out, "
629.99,"or I need extra energy, "
631.12,and I use the clarity formula nowadays 
633.25,for any kind of writing or creative work. 
635.37,Those are the two that I've mainly been taking lately. 
637.89,If you want to try your own personalized 
639.176,"nootropic starter kit, you can go online "
641.99,to takethesis.com/huberman. 
644.68,You'll take a three minute quiz and Thesis will send you 
646.96,four different formulas to try in your first month. 
649.55,You'll have the ability to try those different blends 
651.8,"across that month, discover which nootropics "
653.95,"work best for you, your unique brain chemistry in genetics. "
657.39,"You can have a consult with them, "
659.17,and then they will give you the best nootropics for you.

668.86,Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens. 
671.89,Now called AG
1.,
673.49,I've been taking AG
1,since 
2012.,
675.89,So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. 
678.17,The reason I started taking AG
1,
679.61,and the reason I still take AG
1,once or twice a day 
682.68,is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral probiotic needs. 
686.1,Probiotics are essential because they support what's called 
689.07,a healthy gut microbiome. 
690.62,The gut microbiome is vital for things like 
692.92,"metabolism, hormone function, "
694.55,"and also we now know our brain function, "
697.0,things like focus and memory and our general immune system. 
700.04,With AG
"1,","I get the probiotics I need, "
702.17,I get the vitamins and minerals that I need 
703.79,"to cover any nutritional gaps, if I'm not eating optimally. "
707.22,"And even if I am eating optimally, AG"
1,can further support 
710.95,"metabolism, hormone function, et cetera. "
712.68,"In fact, whenever people ask me, "
714.57,what's the one supplement that I should take 
716.52,if I can only take one supplement? 
717.99,I always say AG
1.,
719.256,I take mine early in the day. 
721.32,I mix it with water and some lemon or lime juice. 
723.41,I love the way it tastes. 
724.26,"And I'll take it again later in the day, "
725.91,typically in the late afternoon. 
727.87,"If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, "
729.3,you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman 
731.88,and claim a special offer. 
733.49,They're giving you five free travel packs

1,
737.17,"while you're on the road, in the car, "
738.43,"on the plane, et cetera, and a year supply of vitamin D"
3,K
2.,
742.89,There's a ton of data now supporting the fact that 
745.71,vitamin D
3,is critical and that most of us don't get enough 
748.91,vitamin D
3,even if we're getting ample sunlight. 
751.68,"Vitamin D three is important from metabolism, "
753.51,"hormone function, brain function, "
754.81,and many other aspects of our biology. 
757.22,"So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, "
760.29,"you can get a special offer of the Athletic Greens, "
762.42,five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D

766.37,Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker. 
769.66,Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform 
771.927,that analyzes data from your blood and DNA 
775.22,to help you better understand your body 
776.79,and help you reach your health goals. 
778.93,I've long been a believer 
780.09,in getting regular blood work done. 
781.84,For the simple reason that many of the factors 
784.24,that influence your immediate and long-term health 
786.56,can only be discovered from a quality blood test. 
789.65,"And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests, "
792.56,you can also get information for instance about 
794.7,"how your biological age compares to your chronological age, "
798.04,which of course is a vital measurement. 
800.82,"Now, one of the major issues with blood tests and DNA tests "
803.81,out there is that people get the information back 
806.4,"that lipid marker of one type, it might be high or low, "
810.75,"or that a hormone of another type might be high or low, "
813.51,but they don't give you any for information 
814.532,about what to do with that information. 
816.7,Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to navigate. 
819.76,"Once you get your results back, "
821.3,you can click on any of those results. 
823.31,And Inside Tracker will immediately show you things 
825.74,"that you can do, for instance, with your nutrition, "
828.01,"or supplementation, or lifestyle factors "
830.47,to help you bring those numbers into the ranges 
832.54,that are appropriate for you. 
834.38,"So it's immensely powerful, not just in terms "
836.51,"of the measurements, but also it provides some directives "
839.27,that can help bring those measurements into the ranges 
841.67,that are best for your immediate and long-term health.

853.21,"Let's talk about desire, love, and attachment. "
855.45,"And of course, these are topics "
857.081,that grab tremendous interest. 
858.79,So it's worth us defining our terms a little bit 
861.8,before going any further. 
863.86,"Of course, we can have many different kinds of loves. "
866.93,"There's romantic love, there's love of family, "
869.99,"so-called familial love, there's love of pets. "
872.64,"We can even love objects, "
874.27,where we can feel as if we love objects. 
876.31,We can love certain activities. 
877.71,We can have friends that we love and so on and so forth. 
880.26,The word love is used to encompass 
881.83,a lot of different types of relationships. 
884.45,"Today, we are mainly going to be focused on romantic love "
887.9,and the neural mechanisms of romantic love. 
891.21,I want to acknowledge here at the outset 
892.78,that most of the studies of romantic love 
895.13,have focused on monogamous heterosexual love. 
898.86,"And also when we talk about studies focused on desire, "
902.3,"and attractiveness, and attachment, that's also the case. "
905.29,And that simply reflects the general bias of the literature 
908.27,over the last 
50,to 
100,years. 
910.66,"It does, of course, not rule out that similar "
913.21,or different mechanisms could be at play 
915.43,"in non-monogamous relationships, "
917.57,"in homosexual relationships, "
919.6,or in relationships of any kind or variation. 
922.93,It's also worth us defining our terms around desire. 
926.42,"It can mean lust, it can mean the desire "
929.37,for long-term partnership. 
930.95,So we need to define our terms and throughout I will do 
933.52,"my best to very carefully define what I mean by desire, "
937.35,"what I mean by love, and what I mean by attachment. "
941.89,"The formal study of love, and desire, and attachment "
946.35,goes back to the early 
1900s.,
949.9,One of the classic studies on this is entitled 
952.607,"""Love and Desire."" "
953.66,It was published in 
1912,and really focused 
956.57,on two opposing themes within romance. 
960.95,One is love which in that paper was really meant to include 
966.2,attachment and dependence or interdependence 
969.44,"between individuals, right? "
971.66,"And the other end of the spectrum being desire, "
974.36,or the sexual desire for another. 
977.23,"And romance was meant to encapsulate both those things, "
980.58,love and desire. 
982.33,And for much of the 
"1900s,",it was thought that love 
986.43,and desire were on opposing ends or in a push pull. 
990.29,And it was the dynamic push and pull between love and desire 
995.3,that one could define romance. 
998.01,And that actually led to much of what's out there 
1000.36,in the psychological literature. 
1002.23,"Today, we are going to explore some neurobiological studies, "
1006.1,"some studies of the endocrine system, "
1008.27,meaning the hormone system 
1009.47,that actually support that general model. 
1011.37,And I'll point you toward what I think is a very useful book 
1014.908,in thinking about how relationships can both form and last 
1019.51,over long periods of time and how those relationships 
1023.23,can include both desire and interdependence. 
1027.93,I'll also talk about some studies that have really focused 
1030.58,"on why relationships succeed and why they fail, "
1034.17,and how that relates to whether or not there is sufficient 
1037.32,amounts of attachment and desire. 
1039.45,So today we're going to talk about the science 
1040.78,and indeed you'll also get some tools. 
1042.74,"Those tools should be useful to you, whether or not "
1044.4,"you happen to be in a relationship or not, "
1047.19,whether or not you're seeking a relationship or not. 
1049.35,I'd like to begin with an anecdote. 
1050.97,And this is not an anecdote 
1052.35,"about my relationship history, "
1054.345,it's an anecdote about my scientific history. 
1058.12,"When I started graduate school, "
1059.5,the chairman of the department I was in at the time 
1061.98,"said to me, ""Most PhDs last longer than most marriages."" "
1067.16,And indeed he was right. 
1068.66,And also most marriages in this country end in divorce. 
1072.48,I think it's about 
50%,with a slight skew toward more ending 
1076.72,in divorce than persist until death do them part. 
1081.43,"But nonetheless, it's about half, "
1083.77,and most marriages end before the eight-year period is up. 
1087.83,Most PhDs take anywhere from four to nine years. 
1091.7,"So there was a bit of a smearing of averages there, "
1093.88,but the point he was trying to make 
1095.18,really landed home for me. 
1097.22,It did not scare me out of relationships 
1100.3,"nor did it scare me out of a PhD, obviously. "
1103.08,What it did illustrate was that there's something 
1106.01,about our attachment machinery 
1108.7,"that can be very, very compelling, "
1110.7,such that people take on tremendous levels of commitment. 
1113.97,I have to imagine that most people enter marriages 
1116.34,assuming that they're going to stay in those marriages. 
1117.612,I don't think most people enter marriages thinking 
1120.32,they're going to get divorced. 
1121.51,But that if 
50%,"of those commitments end in divorce, "
1126.16,there must also be mechanisms 
1127.9,by which our attachments can break. 
1130.74,And today we're going to talk about both the forming 
1132.86,"of attachments and the breaking of attachments, "
1135.36,"what can prevent those breaks in attachments, "
1137.68,and indeed what can lead to re-attachments. 
1141.04,"There are biological mechanisms to desire, love "
1145.94,"and attachment, that's abundantly clear. "
1148.77,Now there's a robust and very large literature 
1152.58,in animal models. 
1153.89,What I mean by that are field studies and laboratory studies 
1157.38,"in primates of different kinds, "
1159.08,such as macaque monkeys or bonobos. 
1162.28,"People have looked at these sorts of things, "
1163.97,"believe it or not, in ducks, in laboratory mice, "
1166.8,"in different types of birds, et cetera. "
1169.51,"And if you look at that literature, you can essentially find "
1172.04,biological examples in the animal kingdom for just about 
1176.18,any behavior that you can easily map to human behavior. 
1179.86,"So for instance, there's a species of animal called "
1182.8,the prairie vole. 
1183.83,"In one portion of the United States, "
1186.35,this prairie vole species is monogamous. 
1188.43,"They only mate with one other prairie vole, "
1191.61,only raise the young with one other prairie vole 
1193.57,for their entire life. 
1195.51,"And in another region of the United States, "
1198.157,"the same species of animal, prairie vole, "
1201.12,"will mate with many individuals, they're non-monogamous. "
1204.09,"And the major difference, at least as far as we know "
1206.42,between the prairie voles in one location 
1208.43,and another location is the levels of a molecule 
1211.96,called vasopressin in the brain and body. 
1213.94,Vasopressin is present in humans. 
1216.01,It has numerous biological roles. 
1218.41,"It's responsible, for instance, for controlling "
1220.6,"the amount of urine that you excrete, "
1222.44,"the amount of water that you retain, "
1224.14,"and for sexual desire, as well as mate seeking. "
1229.78,Levels of vasopressin in prairie voles 
1231.73,are strongly determinant of whether or not a prairie vole 
1235.46,is going to be a monogamous or non-monogamous. 
1238.34,Why do I raise this? 
1239.25,"Well, I raise this because the literature on prairie voles "
1243.56,is quite beautiful and has been discussed quite a lot 
1247.03,in the popular press. 
1247.863,"You can look it up with an easily, just Web Edge search. "
1251.01,"You'll find lots of information about this, "
1252.55,"lots of news articles about this, "
1254.04,and lots of interpretations as to how vasopressin might 
1257.12,be involved in similar or different mechanisms in humans. 
1260.65,"Now, I don't have a problem "
1261.956,with mapping animal studies to humans. 
1264.33,I think there's certainly a place for that. 
1265.59,But if we just lean back and look at the giant mass 
1270.39,"of studies in animals and their mating behavior, "
1273.707,"and their mate selection behavior, "
1275.48,you can essentially find examples of anything. 
1277.87,"You can find examples of polygamy, "
1280.05,"you can find examples of cheating, of infidelity, "
1283.45,you can find examples of all sorts of different behaviors 
1286.23,"that in your own mind, you can map to human behavior. "
1289.31,But it's really hard to make the leap from animal models 
1292.6,to humans in any kind of direct way. 
1294.57,And so thankfully there's been tremendous work done 
1297.9,in the last mainly 
20,"years or so, "
1300.28,"looking at human mate selection, "
1302.5,"human desire, human love and human attachment. "
1305.47,"So we're mainly going to focus on those studies today, "
1307.47,"and where appropriate, we will map those findings back "
1311.22,to the findings in animals to see if there's some universal 
1314.24,truths or some universal principles 
1316.8,about how the neural circuits 
1318.31,and biological mechanisms work. 
1320.03,"But by and large, we're going to focus on human studies today. "
1322.34,"So unless I say otherwise, the data that I'm referring "
1324.69,to today are entirely from human beings. 
1327.21,So let's talk about attachment and attachment styles. 
1330.24,And this will offer you the opportunity 
1331.9,"to answer some important questions for yourself, "
1335.17,"such as what is my, meaning, "
1337.95,your attachment style in relationship? 
1341.86,One of the most robust findings in the field of psychology 
1345.38,is this notion of attachment styles. 
1347.72,And this was something that was discovered 
1349.66,through a beautiful set of studies that were done 
1351.92,by Mary Ainsworth in the 
"1980s,",
1354.78,in which she developed a laboratory condition 
1357.28,called the strange situation task. 
1359.93,"Now, the strange situation task has been studied "
1362.56,"over and over again in different cultures, "
1365.15,in different locations throughout the world. 
1367.4,"And in preparing for this episode, "
1369.62,I actually spoke to three different psychologists. 
1371.44,"I spoke to a psychoanalyst, "
1372.75,"I spoke to a cognitive behavioral psychologist, "
1374.6,"and I actually spoke to a psychiatrist, excuse me, "
1376.39,"not a psychologist, but a psychiatrist with a medical degree "
1379.16,"and asked, is the strange situation task "
1382.0,and the various attachment styles that emerge 
1384.91,"from that task, are those still considered valid? "
1388.29,And indeed all three of them said if ever there was 
1390.63,a literature in psychology that is absolutely tamped down 
1395.12,and has a firm basis in both data and real world principles 
1400.17,"and real world examples, "
1402.0,it's this notion of attachment styles. 
1405.55,So what is the strange situation task? 
1407.6,"The strange situation task involves a parent, "
1410.19,"typically a mother in the studies that were done, "
1412.78,"but a parent or other caregiver bringing their child, "
1416.93,their actual child into a laboratory. 
1419.56,And there's a room with a stranger and the mother enters 
1424.19,the room with the child and there are some toys in the room. 
1428.07,And typically the mother and the stranger will talk. 
1431.44,"Obviously the stranger is part of the experiment, "
1433.28,is not just some random person off the street. 
1435.65,And the child is allowed to move about the room. 
1438.18,They can observe the mother interacting 
1440.19,"with the other person or not, "
1441.404,"they can play with toys or not, "
1443.51,but then at some point the mother leaves. 
1446.82,"And then at some point later designated by the experimenter, "
1449.55,the mother comes back. 
1451.54,"And what is measured in these studies is both how the child, "
1457.2,"the toddler reacts to the mother leaving, "
1461.01,and how the child reacts to the mother returning 
1464.05,at the end of the experiment. 
1465.97,And oftentimes this will have two or three different phases 
1469.72,"where the mother will bring the child in then leave, "
1472.9,then come back in and leave. 
1475.49,There are also studies in which the behavior of the child 
1479.29,with the stranger is also examined. 
1482.12,"So there are a lot of variations of this, "
1483.58,"but the basic findings are that toddlers, children "
1489.61,fall into four different categories of attachment style. 
1494.79,And that these attachment styles can predict many features 
1498.3,"of adolescent, teen, young adult, and even adult "
1502.03,"attachment styles, not in strange situations "
1505.17,"of the sort that I just ascribed, "
1506.69,but in romantic attachments. 
1510.32,"I should mention also that attachment style is plastic, "
1514.61,meaning it can change across the lifespan. 
1517.28,"So as I describe the results, I describe the different "
1519.74,"attachment styles that are out there, "
1522.56,and if any of those resonate with you or bring to mind 
1527.32,"certain people in your life, please do not assume that "
1530.38,those attachment styles are rigid and fixed 
1533.26,for the entire lifespan. 
1534.28,There are also terrific data that indicate that 
1537.27,"through specific processes, both psychological "
1540.41,and some biological adjustments 
1543.53,"that people can change their attachment style, "
1546.03,and that indeed people who have different attachment styles 
1548.62,can change the attachment styles of others. 
1550.92,But just to make very clear what the results 
1552.89,"of the study were, I want to review what the four different "
1555.61,"attachment styles are, and typically people fall "
1557.84,into one group or another but not several. 
1561.01,So the four patterns of attachment that were revealed 
1563.59,"by these studies, again, were revealed by examining "
1567.5,the behavior of the child in response to the mother leaving 
1570.77,"and the mother returning, and the child's response "
1573.83,to the stranger that is in the room with them. 
1576.72,The first style is the so-called secure attachment style. 
1581.12,"In the nomenclature of this kind of study, "
1583.61,"these are the so-called B babies, "
1585.13,"as in the letter B, bulldog, B. "
1587.69,"Not for bulldogs, but just to designate this category. "
1591.01,The secure attachment style is one in which the child 
1595.83,"will engage with the stranger, with the experimenter "
1599.08,while the parent is present in the room. 
1602.33,"But that when the parent, typically it's a mother, "
1604.51,"but when the parent or other caregiver leaves, "
1607.89,the child does get visibly upset. 
1610.0,"They might whine, they might cry, "
1611.47,they might even tantrum a bit. 
1613.49,"However, when the caregiver, meaning the mother, or father, "
1617.23,"or other caregiver returns, the child visibly expresses "
1621.5,"happiness that the caregiver has returned, okay? "
1624.03,So that's the hallmark of the secure attachment style. 
1627.73,"And again, this is all pre-verbal. "
1629.243,This is happening long before the child can express 
1631.73,how they feel with words. 
1633.85,And the interpretation of this is that the secure child 
1636.78,feels confident that the caregiver is available 
1639.87,and will be responsive to their needs 
1642.36,and their communications. 
1643.68,"So that when the child whines and, or is distressed, "
1648.16,the parent doesn't come right back into the room. 
1649.9,But at some point they do and they seem to have a sense 
1652.83,of trust that if the parent or caregiver leaves 
1655.57,"that the parent will come back, "
1657.28,and that they're happy that they do. 
1659.84,These children are also very good at exploring 
1662.86,"novel environments after the parent is gone, "
1665.33,and while the parent is there. 
1666.59,"And almost always, when the parent is there, "
1669.59,"they will explore more broadly, "
1670.841,"literally in space, they'll venture out further "
1674.08,than they will when the parent is gone. 
1676.84,They also tend to engage with the caregiver in a way 
1679.57,"that's not immediately and completely trusting, "
1681.88,but that over time seems to evolve from one 
1684.61,in which they're kind of suspicious of this person 
1686.37,"to one in which they're at least somewhat trusting, okay? "
1689.89,So these were the general contours 
1691.98,of the secure attachment style. 
1693.82,"And fortunately, nowadays there are physiological studies "
1696.6,measuring things like heart rate and breathing 
1698.68,and other measures that correlate with the subjective 
1702.44,assessment of what these children are feeling. 
1705.08,"Okay, so first category is secure attached. "
1707.18,The second category is a so-called anxious-avoidant 
1710.81,"or insecurely attached, which are the category A babies. "
1716.2,The children with anxious-avoidant insecure 
1718.11,attachment patterns generally tend to avoid 
1721.19,"or ignore the caregiver, all right? "
1723.59,"Meaning the parent, and show very little emotion "
1727.68,when the parent leaves or returns. 
1731.26,So this is the reason they call them avoidant 
1733.99,or anxious-avoidant and kind of insecure. 
1736.42,There isn't this happiness or joy that the parent is back. 
1739.39,They don't seem to express that. 
1741.31,They do not exhibit distress on separation. 
1744.57,And they generally tend to have some tendency to approach 
1749.09,"the caregiver when they return, "
1751.48,but there doesn't seem to be a general expression of joy. 
1754.31,"And again, physiological measures support that as well. "
1756.96,Things like changes in heart rate tend to be less dramatic 
1760.73,in the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style 
1764.25,than in the secure attachment style. 
1765.685,"Okay, so that's the second one. "
1768.75,The third category is the so-called 
1770.7,anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure category. 
1775.43,"Okay, I didn't name these categories. "
1776.75,So you have to blame others in this one instance. 
1779.86,"For everything else blame me, but in this instance, "
1781.88,you have to blame the psychologists 
1783.147,that named this category. 
1784.91,The anxious-ambivalent/resistant-insecure category 
1788.7,"also called the C babies, "
1791.04,for the letter C just as a categorization. 
1794.05,"The anxious-ambivalent, resistant-insecure toddlers, really, "
1798.81,show distress even before separation from their mother 
1801.97,or other caregiver. 
1803.19,And they tend to be very clingy and difficult to comfort 
1806.45,"when the caregiver returns, okay? "
1809.08,So they're distressed even before the mother leaves the room 
1812.21,and they tend to be very clingy and really hard to calm down 
1815.43,when the mother returns. 
1818.25,They tend to show either what seems to be resentment 
1821.59,in response to the parent's absence. 
1823.48,We don't really know what they're feeling. 
1824.95,Or some helpless passivity. 
1826.97,And there's actually subcategorizations 
1828.27,"that the psychologists have come up with, C one subtypes "
1831.18,and C two subtypes. 
1832.013,We don't have to get bogged down in that. 
1833.59,But just know that there isn't one absolute measure 
1837.0,"that says, oh, well, this person "
1839.22,"is anxious-ambivalent, resistant-insecure. "
1841.66,"They could be somewhat passive, or they could be, "
1845.53,seem somewhat angry at the caregiver. 
1847.77,"But the basic idea is that before and after the separation, "
1852.81,they are clingy and difficult to comfort. 
1855.28,"They just can't seem to calm themselves down, "
1856.97,and physiological measures of heart rate and hormone 
1859.56,measurements such as cortisol also support that statement. 
1862.84,And the third category of attachment style is the so-called 
1866.7,disorganized or disoriented or D for the letter D babies. 
1871.16,This is a categorization that was added later 
1873.75,to this strange situation task. 
1875.62,That is a real hallmark of developmental psychology studies. 
1879.41,"It was developed by Mary Ainsworth, graduate student, "
1883.32,"Mary Maine, who I actually had the great fortune of taking "
1886.11,a course from and learning from when I was a graduate 
1887.97,student at Berkeley many years ago. 
1890.69,And this fourth categorization was controversial 
1892.82,"for a while, but now is generally accepted. "
1895.75,"The key feature of the disorganized, disoriented category "
1900.17,is that the toddlers tend to be tense 
1903.48,and they tend to encompass a lot of odd physical postures. 
1907.61,They tend to hunch their shoulders. 
1909.97,They'll put their hands behind their neck. 
1911.72,They'll cock their head to the side. 
1914.24,"For those of you listening, "
1915.15,I'm doing this on the video version. 
1916.75,It's not where you don't have to go see that. 
1919.02,"But for those of you that are watching this on video, "
1921.48,they tend to constrain their body size a bit 
1924.34,and going to odd postures that they normally wouldn't 
1928.04,do anywhere else. 
1930.41,So this is why it's called the disorganized 
1932.53,or disoriented category. 
1935.06,It seems like these children just don't really know 
1937.19,how to react to a separation. 
1939.13,And they just start to manifest behaviors and emotional 
1942.38,tones that aren't observed in other situations. 
1945.71,"Okay, so we've got our four categories. "
1947.83,I'll try and use the shortest possible names 
1949.55,for each category. 
1950.383,"We've got category one, which is securely attached. "
1952.67,"We've got category two, which is insecurely attached, "
1955.76,also sometimes called anxious-avoidant. 
1958.17,"Then we've got category three, "
1959.56,"which is the resistant-insecure category, "
1962.75,which is anxious-ambivalent. 
1964.09,"And then there's this fourth category, "
1965.87,"the disorganized, disoriented category "
1968.45,where they're so-called D babies. 
1970.95,"Now, what's interesting about this from the perspective "
1974.73,"of desire, love and attachment is that the categorizations "
1979.94,of children into one of these four different categories 
1983.52,as toddlers is strongly predictive of their attachment style 
1988.31,in romantic partnerships later in life. 
1991.31,Which is to me both amazing and surprising 
1994.93,and not surprising all at the same time. 
1997.1,"Amazing because it means that, first of all, "
2000.92,we are relatively hardwired for attachment. 
2003.72,"I think that that's incredible and beautiful, "
2006.68,"that we have designated neurons, nerve cells "
2009.7,and hormonal systems that are there to ensure 
2012.65,"that we have some response to a caregiver being there, "
2017.09,"or not being there, or returning, or leaving, "
2020.21,"but also that the same neural circuitries, the same hormonal "
2023.86,responses are at least in some way repurposed 
2027.44,for entirely different types of attachments later in life. 
2031.3,So when we hear the psychologist talk about how we formed 
2036.29,a template early in life based on experiences 
2038.8,"that were even pre-verbal before we had language, "
2041.55,"and those templates are superimposed on our relationships, "
2045.33,"or we should say, our later relationships are superimposed "
2048.12,"on those templates, there really is a basis for that. "
2050.69,"We now have neuroimaging studies to support, for instance, "
2054.07,"the work of Allan Schore from UCLA, showing that "
2057.92,"when a mother and child interact, either through very "
2061.87,"soothing interactions, like bottle feeding, "
2064.08,"or breastfeeding, or singing to one's baby, "
2066.93,"or putting them to sleep, that the brain of the child "
2070.32,and the brain of the mother 
2071.61,are entering a coordinated state of relaxation. 
2074.68,"And it's not one direction, mother to child, "
2076.96,the child is also calming the mother. 
2080.45,"Typically these studies were done with mothers again, "
2082.38,"sometimes with fathers, but typically with mothers. "
2085.15,"And in addition to that, when the mother or other caregiver "
2089.02,"acts very excited and raises their voice, "
2091.93,"or puts a lilt in their voice, or widens their eyes, "
2094.82,that the child will do the same. 
2096.116,"And again, there's a bidirectional interaction "
2099.11,in that case of excitement. 
2101.15,And there's the release of neurochemicals like dopamine 
2103.96,"into the bloodstream, whereas in the relaxation scenario "
2106.64,"and the soothing scenario, there's we know the release "
2109.56,of things like serotonin and oxytocin. 
2111.85,So the neural systems for attachment and the neural systems 
2116.88,for what we call autonomic arousal for being alert and calm 
2121.46,don't act in a vacuum. 
2123.74,They are tethered to other people in our environment. 
2126.42,"And of course we know this, right? "
2127.93,"We sometimes hear the statement, "
2129.17,no one can make you feel anything. 
2130.78,I've always had a little bit of a problem 
2132.0,with that statement. 
2134.02,"I don't think I'm contradicting anyone in particular, "
2136.89,"but you hear that a lot, no one can make you feel anything. "
2139.43,"Indeed they can, right? "
2140.62,A physical injury can make you feel something. 
2143.27,"If somebody says something that you very much like, "
2145.49,it can make you feel something. 
2146.387,"And if somebody says something that you very much dislike, "
2149.33,it will make you feel something. 
2150.61,So the idea that no one can make us feel anything 
2152.97,isn't actually true. 
2154.09,Our nervous system is tethered 
2156.4,to the nervous systems of others. 
2157.959,And that is true from the very earliest stages of our lives. 
2161.56,"And in this case, we're talking about how our templates "
2164.34,"for attachment in romantic relationships, how we find them, "
2168.11,"how we maintain them, and indeed how we break them "
2170.4,and reform them is based on a template that was established 
2174.33,"through an entirely different set of priorities, "
2176.61,"which was how we feel safe and secure in novel environments, "
2180.39,depending on whether or not our primary caregiver 
2182.26,is there or not. 
2183.27,Neuroimaging supports that. 
2184.93,"When I say neuroimaging, I mean, brain scan support that, "
2187.46,"measures of hormones in the body and brain support that, "
2190.14,measures of neurochemicals support that. 
2192.06,"There's simply no way around this truth, "
2194.29,that we have a set of roadmaps in our mind that are reused 
2198.39,for entirely different purposes later in life. 
2201.21,That is vitally important to understand. 
2203.77,Because if one is successful in forming 
2207.76,"romantic attachments, maintaining them, et cetera, or not, "
2212.86,does in fact reflect the earlier templates 
2215.88,that you've created. 
2217.13,"But as I've mentioned before, the good news is "
2219.54,that these templates can shift over time. 
2221.66,And one of the more powerful ways to shift those templates 
2224.21,"over time is purely by the knowledge that they exist, "
2227.99,and the understanding that those templates are malleable. 
2231.92,They can change through the process of neuroplasticity. 
2235.64,"Again, neuroplasticity is just a rewiring "
2237.59,of nerve connection. 
2239.03,"That is very much present in childhood, "
2241.76,but also very much present in adulthood. 
2243.95,So if you're somebody who you think falls into category 
2247.21,"one, two, three, or four, or you know somebody, "
2249.89,or involved with somebody who falls into category 
2251.96,"one, two, three, and four, "
2254.73,the mere knowledge of that can be very useful. 
2257.15,"But you might ask, well, what do I do with that knowledge? "
2259.16,"Well, fortunately, both psychologists and biologists "
2261.41,have started to leverage that knowledge toward establishing 
2264.83,"better, more secure bonds in adult romantic relationships. "
2268.32,And there's a book that has really tapped into this. 
2271.27,I think it's the first book that has really addressed 
2273.03,this head on. 
2273.91,And that book comes from two Columbia professors. 
2278.75,"And title of the book is ""Attached: The New Science of Adult "
2283.83,"Attachment and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love."" "
2287.09,The authors of this book are Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. 
2291.22,"Again, both of them are skilled academics and researchers "
2295.07,who have really taken the literature that I described 
2297.7,on the strange situation task 
2299.08,and mapped it to adult attachment styles. 
2301.12,And also they've mapped out ways that they've observed 
2304.92,in their clinical practice. 
2306.28,"And that is laboratory supported for, for instance, "
2310.52,people that have an anxious-ambivalent 
2312.58,"or what we were calling insecure attachment style, "
2314.85,or for people that fall 
2316.47,"into the disorganized or disoriented attachment style, "
2319.83,how they can modify that attachment style in or out 
2323.3,of relationships in order to establish what I think 
2326.7,"everybody wants, which is secure attachment. "
2328.91,Why does everybody want that? 
2330.13,"Well, secure attachment allows people to be both "
2332.93,"in relationship, or if they choose to be on their own, "
2336.19,or to be in relationship but physically separated 
2338.77,"from somebody else, or even emotionally separated "
2340.77,from somebody else and maintain 
2342.565,"what we call a stable autonomic equilibrium, "
2345.55,"the ability to remain calm, clearheaded. "
2348.32,"You might not like what's happening, "
2350.01,but you're able to navigate that with some sense of clarity 
2352.7,and not excessive discomfort. 
2354.77,"So, is there a goal in all of this stuff "
2357.28,"about love, desire, and attachment? "
2359.33,"Indeed, there is. "
2360.61,The secure attachment style is the one that leads 
2364.5,to the most stable and predictable long-term relationships. 
2368.14,"Put differently, babies, toddlers, adolescents, teens, "
2372.73,and young adults that have a secure attachment style 
2375.35,are more likely to find and form long-term relationships 
2378.52,than are people in the other categories. 
2380.82,But people in other categories can learn and eventually 
2384.56,migrate into the secure attachment style. 
2387.69,"And I think that book ""Attached..."" "
2389.96,"I have no affiliation to the authors or the book itself, "
2392.58,I should just mention that. 
2393.617,"""Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment "
2395.82,"and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love,"" "
2397.53,"really it sounds very pop psychology, yes, "
2400.77,but it is really grounded 
2402.04,in the research psychology literature. 
2403.88,And there's also some interesting biology there. 
2406.95,Another point to make about attachment styles 
2409.81,is that it is possible. 
2412.35,And some of you may be familiar with circumstances 
2414.94,"whereby people who are securely attached, "
2418.12,either because they grew up in an environment 
2419.93,"where secure attachment was cultivated, "
2422.11,"or because they developed that on their own, "
2424.61,can also migrate out of the securely attached category 
2429.01,"into insecurely attached, or into avoidant types "
2432.7,"of attachment styles as teens, or as young adults, "
2436.33,"or as adults at any age or any stage of life, "
2440.76,"by virtue of being with somebody who has a different, "
2443.8,"perhaps less adaptive attachment style, right? "
2447.31,What this means is that if you have or you develop 
2450.44,"a secure attachment style, it's vitally important "
2453.76,to protect that attachment style because it is possible 
2456.69,"to become anxiously attached, "
2457.776,even if you grew up in a stable attachment framework. 
2461.21,"And again, this can happen at any stage. "
2463.7,So if you're interested in attachment styles 
2465.51,"and how they influence adult romantic attachments, "
2468.7,"and certainly if you are a parent, I would encourage you "
2472.05,"to check out the book, ""Attached."" "
2474.89,"Again, it's quite good and I think that it offers a number "
2477.46,of actionable tools to both form 
2480.087,and hold onto secure attachment styles. 
2482.5,So I mentioned that the neural circuits for child-parent 
2485.82,or child-caregiver attachment are repurposed 
2489.49,for romantic attachment later in life. 
2492.46,But what are these neural circuits? 
2494.83,What do they do? 
2495.77,"I mean, it's so attractive, if you will, "
2499.15,"to think about a brain area that controls love, "
2501.7,"or a brain area that controls desire, "
2503.78,"or a brain area that controls attachment, "
2505.39,but it simply doesn't work that way. 
2507.25,As I've talked about before on this podcast 
2509.52,and I will say again and again because it will persist 
2511.8,"to be true long after I'm gone, "
2513.9,is that no one brain area can give rise to anything 
2517.91,"as complex as desire, or love, or attachment. "
2521.07,"Instead, there are multiple brain areas that "
2523.64,through their coordinated action create 
2526.06,"a song that we call desire, or a song that we call love, "
2529.97,or a song that we call attachment. 
2531.26,"Not a literal song, although there are songs "
2533.82,"about desire, love, and attachment, of course, many songs, "
2536.38,"some good, some not so good. "
2539.15,But rather different brain areas being active in different 
2542.75,sequences and with different intensities can make us feel 
2546.27,"as if we are in the mode that we call desire, "
2549.56,"or in the mode of love, or in the mode of attachment. "
2552.6,But beneath all of that is this element 
2556.41,of autonomic arousal. 
2557.92,And I want to focus on autonomic arousal 
2560.45,"just for a bit longer, "
2561.5,because it really is one of the three core elements 
2565.27,"by which we form and maintain loving attachments, "
2568.67,and by which we break loving attachments. 
2572.36,The autonomic nervous system 
2574.01,as the name suggests is automatic. 
2577.1,"In fact, that's what autonomic means. "
2579.08,Now it's actually the case that we can control 
2581.86,our autonomic nervous system to some degree or another. 
2584.19,But the autonomic nervous system controls things like 
2586.8,"digestion, our breathing, whether or not we're conscious "
2590.47,of that breathing or not. 
2591.91,It controls things like how alert we are or sleepy we are. 
2595.97,"And the autonomic nervous system, "
2598.12,"as I just briefly described earlier, "
2599.96,is really something that we come into the world with. 
2602.73,"It's hardwired, all the elements are there. "
2605.47,"But through interactions with our parent, "
2608.46,"either soothing interactions, or fun, playful interactions, "
2612.78,"or dare I say, scary interactions, "
2615.52,our autonomic nervous system gets tuned up. 
2618.74,"Meaning, we each develop a tendency to either be more alert "
2622.687,"and anxious, or more calm, or a balance of alert and calm. "
2627.07,"Now, of course, this changes across each day "
2629.06,and depending how tired we are late in the day. 
2630.77,"If we've been awake for a while, "
2631.68,we tend to get sleepy early in the day. 
2633.36,"If we're very rested, "
2634.2,we tend to wake up and feel very alert. 
2636.29,So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system 
2637.96,is it's kind of a seesaw. 
2639.52,"We go back and forth between being very alert, "
2642.17,"we can be alert and calm, or we can be very, very alert, "
2644.8,"we can be in a state of panic, "
2646.26,"we can be fast asleep so we can be extremely calm, "
2649.25,"or we can just be sleepy, semi calm but still also alert. "
2654.9,So think about it like a seesaw. 
2657.03,"And that seesaw has a hinge, "
2659.97,"and that hinge defines how tight or loose that seesaw is, "
2663.27,how readily it can tilt back and forth. 
2666.14,Our autonomic tone is how tight that hinge is. 
2670.16,"And there are biological mechanisms to explain this, "
2672.18,but here I just want to stay with the analogy 
2673.8,of the seesaw for now. 
2676.72,The interactions between child and caregiver early in life 
2681.91,take the child and the caregiver 
2684.29,from one end of the seesaw to the other. 
2687.06,"From being very alert in a state of play, for instance, "
2690.17,to being nursed and being very soothed until we go to sleep. 
2693.49,"And of course, we each have a seesaw, "
2695.98,"the parent and the child has a seesaw, "
2697.117,and they're interacting. 
2698.2,What do I mean by that? 
2699.106,"Well, there are beautiful studies, and beautiful "
2703.0,"not in the sense that they focused on a pleasant topic, "
2705.28,"but beautiful because they were done so beautifully well, "
2708.43,"that looked at, for instance, the response of mothers "
2712.52,and their physiologies and the response of children 
2715.08,and their physiologies during the bombing of cities 
2718.5,during World War II. 
2719.56,So an unpleasant situation. 
2721.54,But what was revealed during the course of these studies 
2725.14,was that if the mothers were very stressed 
2728.75,"during an onslaught of bombing of the city, "
2731.58,"the children's physiologies tended to be stressed also, "
2734.93,and persisted in being stressed long after that stressful 
2738.81,episode was done. 
2741.6,They actually followed that these children 
2743.69,well out from many decades afterwards. 
2747.4,"Conversely, if the parent, and in this case, again, "
2750.85,"it was mothers that were explored in these studies, "
2753.73,had turned this whole business of going 
2755.81,"into the bomb shelters into somewhat of a game, right? "
2759.13,"Taking it seriously, but essentially telling the children, "
2761.627,"""Okay, it's time to go,"" "
2762.46,"but not expressing much stress or distress, "
2765.86,"the children also didn't develop much stress, "
2767.156,"or distress, or trauma. "
2769.4,"Now there were exceptions to this, of course, "
2770.98,"but in general, that was the rule "
2772.162,that the autonomic nervous systems of children tend to mimic 
2775.62,the autonomic nervous systems of the primary caregiver. 
2778.8,And the mechanisms by which this occurs has been explored. 
2782.63,And again I just refer to the beautiful work of Allan Schore 
2785.62,"at University of California, Los Angeles. "
2788.14,"And again, his name is Schore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E. "
2792.387,I'm looking down briefly at the floor here 
2793.94,because I'll just reach for the book. 
2796.63,"He has a wonderful book called ""Right Brain Psychotherapy."" "
2799.73,"It's a little bit technical, "
2800.76,"but if you're interested in some of the studies, "
2803.21,"this book ""Right Brain Psychotherapy"" details how everything "
2806.29,"from nursing of children to playtime behavior, "
2810.32,to strange situation type task behavior that we talked 
2813.26,about before which of course occurs when children 
2815.31,"get dropped off at daycare, or nursery school, "
2817.177,"or with babysitters, et cetera. "
2819.6,And indeed all types of caregiver-child interactions 
2824.08,"tune up that autonomic nervous system, "
2826.91,so that the child ends up with an autonomic nervous system 
2830.22,"that either tends to lean more towards alert and anxious, "
2834.72,"or can be very alert but calm, "
2836.58,or can be very calm and hard to budge. 
2838.44,"Again, it's the tightness of that hinge "
2840.82,that really underlies these attachment styles 
2843.77,"that we were talking about earlier, "
2845.27,"and not on this episode of the ""Huberman Lab Podcast,"" "
2848.03,"but on many other previous previous episodes, "
2849.62,"such as the master stress episode, "
2851.73,or some of the optimized health episodes. 
2854.67,You can find these if you want at hubermanlab.com. 
2856.97,A lot of the tools and techniques that are recommended there 
2860.24,have to do with readjusting the autonomic nervous system 
2863.89,in deliberate ways as an adult. 
2865.265,"Again, I won't go into the specific tools, "
2868.61,"but for instance, the physiological sigh. "
2872.66,This tool that I've talked about extensively of two inhales 
2876.28,"through the nose, as deeply as you can on the first one, "
2878.89,"sneaking in a little bit more air on the second one, "
2880.17,and then a long exhale through the mouth 
2882.91,is a way of adjusting that autonomic seesaw. 
2885.68,It tends to make us more calm. 
2887.34,It activates what we call the parasympathetic arm 
2890.47,"of the autonomic nervous system, which is just fancy nerd "
2892.97,"speak for it's a quick way to calm yourself down, right? "
2896.29,"Things like ice baths, or cold showers, or cold immersion, "
2900.68,"or deliberate hyperventilation by contrast, "
2904.61,or ways in which we can deliberately increase the level 
2908.28,of our so-called sympathetic arm of our autonomic nervous 
2910.967,system to make ourselves more alert. 
2912.87,Why would you want to do that? 
2913.91,"Well, you can do that to be more alert, "
2915.84,"to be more awake, if you like, "
2917.28,or as a form of self-induced stress inoculation 
2920.5,to be able to tolerate higher levels of adrenaline 
2923.77,by making it a practice that you self-direct. 
2927.39,"The reason those tools are out there is because many of us, "
2931.51,"for whatever reason, we don't have to blame anyone, "
2934.38,"but because of our childhood templates, "
2936.88,because of things that happened and didn't happen 
2938.77,"in terms of our interactions with caregivers, "
2940.76,have autonomic nervous systems that are tilted to one side 
2943.37,or the other more than we would like. 
2945.4,Or in which the hinge that I'm talking about in this analogy 
2950.32,is too loose or that is too tight. 
2953.03,"And we're stuck in a mode of anxiousness, "
2955.01,or stuck in a mode of lack of energy. 
2957.18,That's what those tools are really about. 
2959.56,"But at a deeper level, the autonomic nervous system "
2964.66,is really the system that governs how we will react 
2967.9,in response to a romantic partner being present or leaving. 
2973.41,And I don't necessarily mean leaving the relationship 
2975.68,"entirely, although it could mean that, right? "
2977.79,"We know people, I'm sure you know people that upon the end "
2981.21,"of a relationship that they wanted very much, "
2983.47,are absolutely crushed. 
2984.99,"And actually in researching this episode there, "
2987.242,I discovered there's an extensive literature finding 
2990.22,that the feelings that one has after a breakup are very much 
2994.82,like a clinical depression in many cases. 
2997.36,But there are individuals that can look at a breakup 
2999.84,as a transient event that they don't interpret 
3003.33,as going to mean so much for all aspects of their life 
3007.05,"or reshaping their view of themselves, why? "
3010.24,"Well, we have different levels of autonomic function. "
3014.16,"And depending on where our seesaw is, if you will, "
3017.8,some of us become extremely distraught and can't recalibrate 
3021.35,"ourselves, can't adjust ourselves down from stress to calm, "
3025.39,or can't take ourselves from exhausted to more alert 
3028.74,if we need to do that on our own. 
3030.46,And so that's why tools for doing that exist. 
3032.84,But attachment itself is about 
3037.21,where our autonomic nervous system resides. 
3039.73,So if I were to offer a set of tools around these topics 
3042.81,"of desire, love and attachment, I would say, first of all, "
3045.55,you might want to think about whether or not you fall 
3047.15,"into the secure, insecure, or other attachment styles. "
3051.38,"Second, I think it is vitally important for all of us, "
3055.38,but certainly for people that are in relationships 
3058.0,or seeking relationships to be able to at least have some 
3061.89,recognition of where our autonomic nervous system tends 
3065.85,to reside both in terms of when we are with somebody 
3068.94,and when they leave. 
3070.43,"When we are apart for long periods of time, "
3072.35,can we calm ourselves? Can we self-soothe? 
3074.9,Or are we very much dependent on the presence of another 
3077.99,in order to feel soothed? 
3079.51,"Now, I absolutely want to emphasize "
3081.96,that there is nothing wrong. 
3083.39,"In fact, there's everything right with feeling great "
3086.18,in the presence of somebody else. 
3087.58,That is actually a hallmark 
3088.893,of strong and quality attachments. 
3092.1,"These days, we hear the term codependent a lot. "
3094.9,"This was a, I believe, the term was first coined "
3097.19,by Pia Mellody. 
3098.26,And it actually does occupy an important role in the world 
3102.98,"of trauma, trauma healing, so-called trauma bonding, "
3106.03,topics of another episode. 
3107.21,"Actually, did an episode on fear and trauma. "
3108.92,And we will do one all about trauma bonding 
3110.67,with an expert at some point in the future. 
3112.94,"But codependence and codependency, the term can sometimes "
3118.06,be misinterpreted as any dependence on another isn't good. 
3123.55,"Interdependence, a healthy interdependence, "
3125.97,of course is good. 
3127.09,"It is the hallmark of healthy child-parent relations, "
3129.75,sibling relations and romantic relations. 
3132.53,"But a key element of healthy interdependence is that, "
3136.51,"yes, our autonomic nervous system is adjusted "
3139.21,"by the presence of another, but that also that we can adjust "
3142.5,"our own autonomic nervous system, "
3144.06,even in the absence of that person. 
3146.41,"That if the person goes away temporarily or permanently, "
3150.17,"that we can still regulate our own autonomic nervous system, "
3153.63,"both from states of stress to states of calm, "
3155.95,both from states of exhaustion to states of more alertness. 
3160.35,"And of course, we all need sleep "
3161.66,to go from exhaustion to alertness. 
3163.85,But what I'm referring to here is the ability to regulate 
3166.88,"when distraught, or regulate when fatigued, "
3171.54,or feeling depressed. 
3172.87,And that is and is all about the autonomic nervous system. 
3177.03,"So as we talk about attachment styles, "
3178.72,and we talk about infant and toddler 
3180.91,"and adult attachment styles, "
3181.843,what we are really talking about is a complex set 
3184.79,of neural circuitries. 
3185.8,"And one of those neural circuitries, which is absolutely "
3188.61,crucial is this autonomic nervous system. 
3191.07,So if the autonomic nervous system is one key component 
3194.82,"of desire, love and attachment, what are the other two? "
3198.88,And what I'm going to tell you next is largely the pioneering 
3202.64,"work of Helen Fisher, who is really an anthropologist, "
3206.69,who's become a bit of a neuroscientist and has collaborated 
3209.65,with neuroscientists to establish brain areas 
3212.72,and neural circuits that are associated 
3214.33,"with different aspects of attachment, love and desire. "
3217.02,I think the first really high quality study 
3219.69,of neural circuits associated with these themes 
3222.74,was a paper published in 
2005,in a very fine anatomical 
3227.51,"journal, perhaps the best neural anatomical journal, "
3230.47,which is the Journal of Comparative Neurology. 
3233.24,The Journal of Comparative Neurology has been around 
3235.24,for more than 
100,years and is considered the archival 
3239.34,location for placing really high quality anatomy. 
3242.79,They have tremendously high standards. 
3244.61,"And the study that I'm referring to is entitled, "
3247.277,"""Romantic Love: An fMRI,"" "
3249.5,"meaning functional magnetic resonance imaging, "
3251.867,"""Study of a Neural Mechanism for Mate Choice."" "
3254.9,And Dr. Fisher is a author on this paper 
3259.13,"as is Arthur Aron, and Lucy Brown. "
3261.99,So all very fine researchers. 
3264.01,And this study as well as several other studies 
3267.58,"using magnetic resonance imaging, "
3270.68,"things like EEG, neuro anatomical tracing, et cetera, "
3273.76,have identified a large number of brain areas 
3275.69,that are associated with different aspects 
3277.14,"of desire, love, and attachment. "
3278.254,And I'll just throw out a few names of those brain areas 
3280.67,and what they control. 
3281.63,And then I'll tell you how those anchor 
3283.9,to the other two categories of neural circuits 
3286.43,"essential for desire, love, and attachment. "
3288.57,So not surprisingly the dopamine system in the brain 
3293.38,"is associated with desire, love, and attachment, "
3295.92,"and mainly with desire, although to some extent, love. "
3298.76,Dopamine is a neurochemical sometimes 
3300.47,associated with reward. 
3301.669,"But as some of you have heard me say before, "
3305.16,"it is mainly a molecule of motivation, craving and pursuit. "
3309.66,"And that motivation, craving and pursuit that relates "
3312.48,"to dopamine is not unique to attachment, or love, or sex, "
3315.95,"or mating, et cetera. "
3317.07,It is a universal generic currency in the brain 
3320.87,for pursuing something. 
3322.34,"Food when you're hungry, a mate when you want one, "
3325.35,"to mate when you want to, warmth when you're cold, "
3329.01,"et cetera, et cetera, okay? "
3330.26,So it's not for one specific purpose. 
3331.602,"But the brain areas associated with dopamine involve, "
3336.01,"for instance, the ventral tegmental area, "
3338.57,"the substantia nigra, areas of that sort, the basal ganglia. "
3342.91,"You don't need to know these names, "
3344.06,just understand that these are networks of neurons 
3346.58,"that tend to have put the person, you into a state "
3349.95,of forward action and pursuit and craving and motivation. 
3354.01,"They are not about being quiescent, relaxed, et cetera. "
3357.18,The neural circuits for quiescence and relaxation 
3361.78,"are most associated with love and attachment, "
3364.76,"not surprisingly, and they're the neurochemical "
3367.17,"serotonin, and to some extent, oxytocin "
3369.83,are the predominant neurochemicals involved. 
3372.31,"And those are released from brain areas, "
3373.538,such as the raphe nucleus in the back of the brain. 
3376.51,You may have heard that the majority of serotonin 
3378.71,"in your body is made in your gut, and indeed, that's true, "
3382.11,"but I hate to break it to you, the serotonin in your gut "
3385.64,"is not responsible for your feelings of love and attachment, "
3388.79,at least not to a high degree. 
3390.15,That's mainly going to be the reflection of neurons 
3392.81,in your brain that make serotonin. 
3395.16,And there are other areas of the brain that make serotonin 
3397.7,"as well and oxytocin as well, "
3399.99,"but they tend to be associated with the warmth and calm, "
3403.22,and the soothing that we feel in the presence of another. 
3406.58,"And again, these are not strictly divided circuits. "
3409.95,We can have dopamine and serotonin present in our brain 
3412.087,and body at the same time to equal or different degrees. 
3416.05,And we return in a little bit to what happens when levels 
3419.07,of dopamine are very high and levels of serotonin are low 
3421.59,"and vice versa and so on, "
3422.842,"including in states of neurochemically modified states, "
3428.38,"as it were in, when we talk about things like MDMA, "
3431.69,so-called ecstasy. 
3433.48,"But in the meantime, I want to just discuss "
3436.95,"the two neural circuits that use dopamine, "
3440.53,"that use serotonin and oxytocin, "
3442.78,and that collaborate with the autonomic nervous system 
3446.13,"to drive what we call desire, love and attachment. "
3449.35,"And the three circuits are autonomic nervous system, "
3453.77,we talked about that one. 
3454.947,Then there's the nervous system components 
3457.92,"or the neural circuits for empathy, for being able to see "
3462.4,and respond to indeed match the emotional tone 
3466.74,or the autonomic tone of another. 
3469.5,"And then there's the third category, "
3471.23,"and this might surprise some of you, "
3472.35,"it certainly surprised me, "
3473.8,but the data point to the fact that the third neural circuit 
3476.89,that's very important for establishing bonds 
3479.86,is one associated with positive delusions. 
3482.78,So given that the neural circuits for empathy 
3484.092,are absolutely crucial for falling in love 
3487.48,"and maintaining stable attachments, "
3490.33,I'd like to talk about those neural circuits 
3491.407,and what they are. 
3493.29,"Now, often when we hear empathy, we think, "
3495.61,"oh, empathy is really about listening to and really "
3499.75,understanding what somebody else is feeling. 
3501.63,Maybe even feeling what they're feeling. 
3503.97,"And indeed that's the case, but what do we mean by that? "
3507.13,Right? What is it to feel what another feels? 
3509.85,"Well, what it means is that their seesaw "
3513.18,"is driving your seesaw, "
3516.04,or your seesaw is somehow driving their seesaw. 
3519.72,That there's a match in terms of the tilt of those seesaws. 
3522.65,"Now it doesn't have to be an exact match, right? "
3524.65,If someone that you really he care about 
3525.695,"is very, very stressed, you could also become very stressed. "
3530.34,"That's a form of empathic matching, "
3532.93,and there are indeed neural circuits for that. 
3534.74,I'll describe what those neural circuits are in a moment. 
3537.21,But sometimes the best role for us to take is actually one 
3540.47,in which we are calm when the person that we care about 
3543.86,or that we are romantically involved 
3545.26,"with is very, very anxious. "
3547.08,"And in a few minutes, I'll talk about how matching "
3550.26,of emotional tone can be good or bad 
3553.08,"for the stability of a relationship, "
3556.21,and complementarity of autonomic matching 
3559.93,can be good or bad. 
3561.37,"In other words, sometimes it's beneficial for a relationship "
3565.35,to go into the same state as the other. 
3567.96,And sometimes it's more beneficial for us to not go 
3570.81,into the same state as the other. 
3573.7,But the important feature here is that when we talk about 
3577.47,emotional matching or empathy or going into the same state 
3580.33,"or not going into the same state, what we are really talking "
3582.68,about is whether or not the autonomic seesaw 
3587.5,of one individual is driving the autonomic seesaw 
3590.41,of the other individual. 
3592.21,And this is a vital principle for how we fall in love 
3596.52,and form attachments. 
3597.56,And it's actually part of the desire 
3599.44,and mating process itself. 
3602.69,I would go so far as to say that one of the prerequisites 
3607.78,to the propagation and expansion of our species 
3611.89,is this notion of autonomic regulation. 
3615.48,"And to some extent, matching of autonomic nervous systems. "
3618.76,Let me explain what I mean. 
3620.93,"Last I checked, the only way that new humans can be created "
3624.7,"is by way of sperm meeting egg, either in body or in dish, "
3629.84,"but sperm meets egg and then typically nine months later, "
3633.98,we have a human baby. 
3636.51,"The process of bringing sperm to egg, right? "
3640.54,"Mating behavior, sex behavior in humans "
3643.1,is one of autonomic regulation. 
3646.69,"And what I mean by that is the process of finding a mate, "
3654.18,"and in this case, I mean, actually someone to mate with, "
3656.15,"typically, well, scenarios vary, typically, "
3659.08,"is one of elevated autonomic arousal, "
3663.12,meaning increased activation 
3664.92,of the so-called sympathetic nervous system. 
3667.09,This is related to dopamine release 
3669.17,and it's related to epinephrine release. 
3671.36,There has to be a pursuit or at least there has to be 
3675.03,a mobilization to arrive in the same location 
3678.36,"whereby one can mate, right? "
3680.38,That almost always is the case. 
3683.68,"However, the sexual arousal itself "
3689.24,in both males and females 
3691.83,is actually driven primarily by the parasympathetic arm 
3696.9,of the autonomic nervous system. 
3699.01,"So while pursuit is one of alertness and sympathetic drive, "
3704.18,"as we say, again, sympathy is not really "
3707.1,"what's at play here, "
3708.45,"the word simple means together, "
3710.02,and the activation of the autonomic nervous system 
3712.53,toward more alert state 
3713.82,"is because of a sympathetic nervous system, "
3715.343,meaning the co-activation together of many neurons 
3718.55,in the brain and spinal cord. 
3720.36,But then the actual physiological arousal state 
3724.147,that we call sexual arousal is predominantly 
3727.082,"parasympathetically driven, okay? "
3730.01,"To be quite direct about this, "
3731.43,"if the sympathetic nervous system activation is too high, "
3734.36,the sexual arousal response cannot happen in either males 
3737.7,"or in females, it's inhibited. "
3740.16,"However, the orgasm and ejaculation response, "
3745.03,which if you think about it is required for sperm 
3748.34,to meet egg is sympathetic driven. 
3754.5,"And then after orgasm and ejaculation, "
3757.41,"the parasympathetic nervousness system kicks back in, "
3760.09,and there's a calming and relaxation. 
3762.37,"So the arc of mating involves sympathetic arousal, okay? "
3768.76,"Not sympathy, but alertness and arousal for pursuit, "
3772.27,then a tilt of the seesaw at least to some degree 
3775.23,for arousal of the sort that we typically hear 
3778.05,of sexual arousal. 
3780.13,Then at the point of orgasm and ejaculation is back 
3784.65,to a sympathetic response. 
3786.23,And how can I say that? How do I know that? 
3788.7,The sympathetic nervous system meaning neurons 
3791.08,within the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system 
3793.54,are what drive ejaculation and orgasm. 
3797.43,And then afterward there's a return 
3800.84,to increased parasympathetic activation. 
3804.05,"And we don't know for sure why that happens, "
3806.64,"but it's thought that in species that pair bond, "
3810.77,"humans generally pair bond, not always, "
3813.32,there the return to more parasympathetic activation 
3816.95,after orgasm and ejaculation is thought to increase 
3819.87,"the exchange of pheromonal orders, odors, excuse me, "
3823.15,and to increase pillow talk and pair bonding 
3825.66,"of different kinds, okay? "
3826.892,So that's the seesaw going back and forth is actually built 
3832.54,into the process by which our entire species propagates. 
3837.14,"So in some ways, every human is required to navigate "
3842.45,that process if they want their offspring to persist. 
3845.32,"And of course, nowadays there are technologies like "
3847.82,"in vitro fertilization, intrauterine insemination, "
3852.62,there are a variety of ways that technology has allowed 
3855.17,people to circumvent the actual physical mating process 
3857.9,in the way that I described. 
3859.18,"But by and large, that's the way it it's done. "
3861.81,And certainly that's the way it was done historically 
3863.94,for if not tens of thousands 
3865.73,or hundreds of thousands of years. 
3867.79,That process is also what happens 
3870.95,in all mammalian species that mate. 
3873.79,"Okay, so I'm overlooking an entire literature "
3876.5,of animal studies that classic studies of this were done 
3880.87,"by two individuals, I'll just briefly mention them "
3882.79,in case you want to look at the literature. 
3885.01,There's a guy at the Rockefeller University named 
3887.75,"Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F, who has done beautiful studies "
3892.42,"identifying the neural circuitry, "
3893.85,what's called the lordosis response. 
3896.07,"Unlike in humans, the mating behavior of animals "
3899.61,is rather stereotyped in terms of the positions 
3901.84,that they occupy. 
3902.75,And the lordosis response is a U-shaping 
3905.49,"or a bending up of the hindquarters of typically of rodents, "
3908.9,but of other animals as well. 
3910.43,The the male mounting is almost always from behind 
3913.67,except in some species of primates. 
3915.57,And that lordosis response is only going to occur 
3919.55,during particular phases of the estrous cycle. 
3922.36,"The estrous cycle is the analog to the menstrual cycle, "
3927.07,but it's not 
28,"days, it's four days or some other duration "
3930.43,"in other animals, depending on the animal. "
3932.76,"The lordosis response is strongly regulated by odors, "
3936.05,by contact and is estrogen and testosterone controlled. 
3940.17,"And then the male portion of the mating sequence in animals, "
3945.33,the mounting and thrusting and ejaculation as they're called 
3947.79,"or mounting, thrusting, intromission and ejaculation. "
3950.01,Those are the four scientific categories 
3951.78,"that have been described, "
3953.8,that's presence in rodents and also in dogs 
3956.25,"where it was primarily studied by Frank Beach, "
3958.46,"who was at University of California, Berkeley "
3961.71,for a long time. 
3962.58,And the entire literature around the neural circuitry 
3966.02,for sexual mating behavior in animals largely stemmed 
3970.82,from the work of Donald Pfaff and Frank Beach 
3973.55,"and their scientific offspring, not their actual offspring. "
3977.36,"You can look at that literature, if you like. "
3979.65,There have been human neuroimaging studies of the process 
3983.73,"that I described a few minutes ago, believe it or not, "
3986.38,"of people in brain scanners, not necessarily mating "
3990.58,"with other people, but going through that arc of arousal, "
3996.31,sympathetic activation during orgasm or ejaculation 
3999.0,and then the post-ejaculatory or orgasmic phase 
4002.46,in both men and women. 
4003.71,And the brain areas associated with those 
4006.63,have all been mapped out now. 
4009.53,"The spinal cord areas that control things like erection, "
4014.48,"vaginal lubrication, ejaculation and orgasm, "
4017.12,those have also been mapped out. 
4018.68,And this has all been explored from the perspective 
4020.9,"of both basic science, just to get an understanding "
4023.48,"of how our species has sexual interactions and reproduces, "
4027.83,"but also from the perspective of, for instance, "
4030.41,"trying to repair sexual function after spinal cord injury, "
4034.81,"which is a prominent concern for a lot of people, "
4038.11,"depending on where they have their injury, "
4039.78,but in the number of people that have spinal cord injuries. 
4042.87,So this is both vital biological and clinical data. 
4048.9,The neural circuits for everything that I just described 
4052.51,reside in the autonomic nervous system and are coordinated 
4055.67,with the neural circuits that are associated with empathy. 
4058.37,"The neural circuits for empathy, again, there are many, "
4061.44,"but mainly two structures that you should know about, "
4063.63,"the prefrontal cortex, "
4064.69,which is how we perceive things outside of us 
4067.47,"and make decisions on the basis of those perceptions, "
4069.92,"how we organize those decisions, "
4072.08,"and an area of the brain called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A. "
4075.53,The insula is a really interesting brain area that allows us 
4080.3,"to interocept, to pay attention to what's going on inside "
4083.28,"our body and to split some of our attention, to exterocept. "
4087.2,"And the mating dance, whether or not it's the dinner "
4091.14,"and date portion of the mating dance, "
4092.388,"or the actual physical dance part of the main dance, "
4095.06,"or actual mating and sexual behavior, kissing or otherwise, "
4100.26,"that is a coordinated activity of two bodies, "
4105.04,typically it's two. 
4106.1,"I realize sometimes it's more, sometimes it's only one, "
4108.32,but typically it's two bodies at least in the framework 
4111.61,we're using here. 
4113.29,That coordinated dance is one 
4115.31,in which the autonomic nervous system of one individual 
4119.37,in general is coordinating with the autonomic nervous system 
4121.75,of the other individual. 
4122.94,And the insula is essentially splitting one's attention 
4127.43,"between how we feel ourselves, how our body feels, "
4132.2,what we're thinking with the thinking 
4134.51,and the bodily sensations of the other. 
4137.34,"And that can be communicated, obviously, through words, "
4140.38,"it can be communicated through sounds, "
4142.33,"it can be communicated through touch, "
4143.576,and it can be communicated through a number 
4145.86,"of more subtle cues like pupil size or whether or not, "
4150.34,certainly in cases where we recognize the person 
4152.39,"and we know their responses, their autonomic responses "
4155.64,under different conditions. 
4156.473,"We can assess, is the person comfortable? "
4158.91,Are they uncomfortable? 
4160.068,Are they more focused on me or on themselves? 
4163.21,This is the coordinated silent dance that 
4165.91,"if we look out in neurobiological terms, "
4168.63,"we can really see is all about the autonomic nervous system, "
4172.82,whether or not it's time to tip the seesaw to one side 
4177.16,"or the other, depending on whether or not the other person's "
4179.65,seesaw is tilted higher or lower than the other. 
4182.45,"Okay, so we have the autonomic nervous system, "
4184.26,"and then we have this thing that we're calling empathy, "
4186.72,which is really about autonomic matching. 
4189.45,"And again, the insula and the prefrontal cortex "
4192.03,"are neural circuits that are crucial for autonomic matching, "
4195.74,"because they allow us to say, what's out there, "
4198.48,and do I want to match to it or not? Okay? 
4201.48,And then the third category of neural circuit 
4204.44,that Helen Fisher and others have found to be important 
4206.92,"for desire, love and attachment is the neural circuit "
4210.16,associated with self-delusion. 
4212.32,What do we mean by that? 
4213.693,"Well, first of all, self-delusion implies a kind of cynicism "
4220.46,about love and attachment. 
4221.67,"And I think it was George Bernard Shaw that said, "
4224.617,"""Love is really about overestimating "
4226.9,"the differences between individuals."" "
4229.24,"Actually, when I hear that, and as I say it, "
4230.535,I really don't like that quote. 
4232.87,"I have no bone to pick with George Bernard Shaw, "
4234.93,"but what it suggests and I think what he meant was that, "
4240.34,"in love and attachment, we tend to put so much value "
4243.85,in the other that we forget that many of the processes 
4246.96,that are going on in our brain and body 
4249.15,actually could be evoked by many other people too. 
4251.76,But I think it somewhat overlooks the enormous power 
4255.06,"of attachment and the ways in which somebody's smell, "
4258.4,"somebody's voice, somebody's everything, "
4261.86,or somebody's particular thing or things can really 
4265.3,become so vital for our autonomic nervous system 
4268.38,"to feel soothed and to feel elated, et cetera. "
4271.02,"So I think that while the quote is accurate, "
4275.68,"in the one sense, I think it does overlook "
4277.643,the neural circuits for attachment 
4279.7,and just how deeply wired those can become for us. 
4283.18,So I will balance that quote with an enormous number 
4287.29,"of other quotes that I won't mention, but that you can find "
4290.23,out there that really point to how incredible the person is 
4295.583,that one tends to be attached to that there's really 
4298.1,only one or several people that could ever exist 
4302.09,that could evoke those feelings from us. 
4303.64,"And of course you can read your Neruda poetry, "
4307.47,"and you can find these things all over the place, "
4309.09,"in music, and poetry, and writing. "
4311.44,So for every cynical quote about these neural circuits 
4315.04,"being generic and could be activated by anybody, "
4317.99,I think you'll find an ample number of opposing quotes 
4322.6,that these neural circuits can only be activated 
4324.93,"by that special someone, or that particular person, "
4327.82,or maybe in just a small set of those people. 
4330.06,So what of delusion? 
4331.475,"Well, the work of Helen Fisher and others has really pointed "
4336.78,"to the fact that desire, love and attachment "
4340.24,are three separate phases 
4342.53,of what we call romantic relationships. 
4345.42,"That typically, not always, but typically desire tends "
4349.15,to come first or falls in the early phase. 
4352.33,"That the process of romantic/sexual interactions, "
4356.9,"it doesn't necessarily have to be sex itself, "
4358.76,but certainly something that involves intimacy 
4362.14,"of some kind, right? "
4364.18,"And generally touch of some kind, "
4366.94,"eventually transitions into what we call love, "
4369.28,which eventually transitions into what we call attachment. 
4373.07,And I should just mention touch because touch 
4376.57,is a fundamental aspect of this whole process. 
4379.64,"There's an article, a research article, I should say, "
4383.34,"the title of it is, "
4384.173,"""Relationship-specific Encoding of Social Touch "
4386.64,"in Somatosensory and Insular Cortices."" "
4390.1,Cortices being cortex. 
4392.11,"Cortex's plural, cortices. "
4393.98,"And again, there's our friend the insula. "
4396.13,So this is a study that explored what brain areas 
4398.93,and what body areas are activated by specific forms 
4403.62,of attachment and social touch. 
4405.78,And what they found not surprisingly is that the areas 
4409.19,"of the brain that are associated with touch, "
4410.56,"the somatosensory areas, but more interestingly, "
4413.63,the insular cortex are strongly activated by touch. 
4418.91,"So touch in the amount of touching, and proximity, "
4422.14,"and skin contact, not surprisingly activates brain areas "
4425.57,"associated with somatosensory, touch, "
4428.45,"but also the insular cortex, which again, "
4430.74,is this brain area that links the internal 
4433.7,or feelings about what's going on inside us 
4435.557,and at the surface of our skin with events external. 
4438.91,"And they found activation of a number of brain areas, "
4442.03,"the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and so on and so on. "
4445.66,That's not as essential as just understanding 
4447.47,that the insular is the place in which we start to take 
4451.25,"our experience of our internal landscape, "
4453.79,"attach that to our perceptions of the external landscape, "
4456.75,and then assign that a value or assign that 
4460.25,some sort of interpretation. 
4461.89,And positive delusion is predictive of long-term attachment. 
4468.27,What do we mean by positive delusion? 
4469.64,Positive delusion is the contradiction 
4472.87,of that George Bernard Shaw quote. 
4474.526,It's the belief that only this person 
4478.63,can make me feel this way. 
4480.209,This other person holds the capacity to make me feel 
4484.62,this way physically or emotionally or both. 
4487.75,"And so, as we move from desire to love to attachment, "
4492.83,our brain circuitry is literally getting tuned up such that 
4496.36,"that individual that we happen to be attached to, "
4499.13,"again, here thinking about monogamous relationships, "
4501.52,but I guess for non-monogamous relationship individuals 
4506.84,is and are the way in which our autonomic nervous system 
4510.31,can be regulated. 
4511.17,They actually get access to our control panel. 
4514.24,So it's our autonomic nervous system empathy 
4516.091,and this positive delusion. 
4519.57,Now positive delusion is critical. 
4521.142,"If you look at the stability of relationships over time, "
4525.87,something that's been extensively studied 
4527.85,"mainly by psychologists, but now also by neurobiologists, "
4531.64,what you find is that there are some key features 
4536.3,of interactions between individuals that predict 
4539.502,that a relationship will last. 
4541.56,"And those are many, "
4543.08,but mainly fall under this category of positive delusions. 
4546.46,I'll return to those in what those exactly look like. 
4548.98,But there are also just a handful of things that predict 
4552.9,that a relationship will fail over time. 
4555.35,"This is largely the work of the Gottman's, "
4558.21,is actually a husband and wife team 
4559.79,up at the University of Washington in Seattle. 
4563.25,"The Gottman's have, run a laboratory "
4566.24,in the department of psychology for a long time. 
4568.05,They've also done a lot of public facing 
4569.67,work around relationships. 
4571.62,And they've talked about the various aspects 
4575.63,of relationships and interactions between people 
4577.91,that predict either staying together or breaking up. 
4580.31,So much so that they've established a method 
4584.08,by which they can look at video interactions between couples 
4587.95,and with very high degree of certainty predict 
4590.98,whether or not those couples will stay together 
4592.72,or break up over time. 
4594.02,And they've identified what they call 
4595.51,the four horsemen of relationships. 
4597.95,"These are things that essentially, "
4600.581,almost always predict that a couple will break up. 
4605.18,And I think the current number on this is that Gottman 
4609.47,can predict divorce with 
94%,"accuracy, "
4613.11,which if you think about is pretty remarkable. 
4615.14,"So even though these are purely psychological studies, "
4617.94,"I'm not aware of any analysis of underlying physiology, "
4621.53,there are some things that they can observe between couples 
4625.32,that can lead them to predict whether or not a couple 
4628.02,will stay together or break up with 
94%,accuracy. 
4631.42,So what are those things? 
4632.8,"Those four behaviors, what they call the Four Horsemen "
4635.37,of the Apocalypse [laughs] for relationships 
4639.791,"are one, criticism, two, defensiveness, three, stonewalling, "
4645.92,"and four, contempt, with contempt being the most powerful "
4650.57,predictor of breaking up. 
4654.1,"Criticism, of course, does not mean that there's no place "
4658.45,for criticism in stable relationships. 
4660.92,"Of course, there is. "
4662.37,Has to do with how frequent and how intensely 
4664.67,that criticism is voiced. 
4666.15,"Defensiveness, of course, is defensiveness. "
4669.4,We know as the lack of ability to hear another 
4674.28,or to adopt their stance. 
4675.56,"So lack of empathy, "
4677.02,I think is one way to interpret defensiveness. 
4680.43,"Stonewalling, which is actually another form "
4683.26,of lack of empathy. 
4684.14,It's a turning off of this neural circuit 
4686.22,"that's so critical for desire, love and attachment. "
4689.23,The stonewalling essentially means the emotional response 
4693.61,or the request of another is completely cut off. 
4695.54,"So it's, I don't think there's been brain imaging of this, "
4698.84,"but I think, we can reasonably imagine that it involves "
4701.725,untethering your insular response from the other 
4705.96,"and what they're dealing with, "
4706.95,"and focusing your insular response, "
4709.764,"[giggles] no pun intended, on your own internal state "
4713.31,or perhaps the state of someone else entirely. 
4716.02,I'll talk about infidelity in a moment. 
4717.43,And then contempt. 
4718.6,And contempt has actually been referred 
4720.149,to as the sulfuric acid of relationship. 
4723.3,"I didn't say that, but Gottman and colleagues have. "
4725.87,That it is such a powerful predictor 
4728.48,of divorce and breakups in the future. 
4731.81,"And contempt, of course, by definition is the feeling "
4735.35,"that a person or thing is beneath consideration, "
4737.87,worthlessness or deserving scorn. 
4740.85,And apparently they can identify this in the videos 
4743.52,of couples having discussions and interacting 
4746.17,"by very elaborate eye rolls, by expressions of anger "
4751.79,in one individual when their partner is actually expressing 
4754.75,enthusiasm or excitement about something. 
4756.99,"It's the, oh yeah, you would say that, "
4760.04,"or deep seated resentment toward the other, "
4763.5,so much so that it's apparent that one actively dislikes 
4768.28,the other partner. 
4770.37,"So contempt, disregard for something that should be taken "
4773.99,into account is the other way to think about it. 
4776.21,"That runs counter to all of the neural circuits, "
4779.44,all three of the neural circuits 
4780.73,that we talked about before. 
4781.75,"It certainly, it is the antithesis of empathy. "
4785.34,It is anything but a positive delusion. 
4787.55,"It's really looking at the other individual, "
4789.55,either accurately or inaccurately 
4791.49,as somebody that you despise. 
4794.03,And then it is an absolute inversion of the autonomic 
4798.39,seesaw matching that I was talking about before. 
4800.84,It's a dissociating of your seesaw from their seesaw. 
4803.61,"They're very excited about something, "
4805.15,you're unexcited by it. 
4806.94,"In fact, it's an inversion of their seesaw "
4809.16,"where they're excited, you're down. "
4812.75,"They're down, you are up, okay? "
4814.93,So it's basically an inversion of all of the neural circuits 
4819.64,that Helen Fisher and others have identified as critical 
4822.74,"for desire, love, and attachment. "
4824.33,And therefore it's not surprising that it is so strongly 
4828.3,"predictive of breakups, "
4829.51,"and in the case of married couples, of divorce. "
4832.13,For those of you that are interested in the work 
4833.541,"of the Gottman's and similar work, "
4837.04,they've written several popular books. 
4839.22,They're fairly easy to find. 
4840.86,We can link to one of those in the caption. 
4844.02,But they've also developed 
4845.01,some quite interesting online resources 
4848.5,in their so-called Love Lab. 
4850.5,I guess it's fortunate that they didn't call it the Hate Lab 
4853.59,"or the Breakup Lab, "
4854.43,'cause they focused a lot on what predicts breakups. 
4856.94,But they've also written extensively and researched 
4860.32,extensively in peer-reviewed studies 
4863.61,"what makes people find appropriate partners for them, "
4868.19,and to maintain those partnerships over time. 
4872.47,"So you can go, you can search for Love Lab, "
4875.08,"University of Washington, Gottman, "
4877.1,or any number of their various books. 
4879.37,I think you'll find some useful resources there. 
4884.17,I want to shift back to the work of Helen Fisher. 
4888.14,She's made some very interesting statements 
4891.15,and some very interesting observations 
4893.33,that at least to my mind map very well 
4895.84,onto the knowledge of neural circuitry both in humans 
4899.47,and in non-human primates and in other species. 
4901.63,I realize that she's the only name in the game. 
4905.93,"But she's made some observations that I think are very, "
4909.8,"as we say, parsimonious, meaning they allow us to organize "
4912.62,a lot of this stuff into some distinct frameworks. 
4915.71,"Now, she's also done some really beautiful studies "
4918.472,that involve data from millions or even tens of millions 
4922.32,of individuals on dating sites. 
4924.02,So I'm going to share those with you in a moment. 
4925.34,"But before I do that, I just want to paraphrase Dr. Fisher, "
4931.65,who said that sex drive or desire that the pursuit 
4936.81,"of someone to mate with, meaning to mate, the verb, "
4939.92,"not necessarily to find a mate, may be, "
4945.37,"she didn't say definitively, but may be a way to forage "
4948.01,for potential love partners that the arc of this 
4951.57,"whole business is really the order that we're describing it, "
4954.58,"that it's desire, then love, and then attachment. "
4959.41,And that oftentimes people can get confused. 
4963.12,"You may know some of these people, "
4964.67,you may be one of these individuals who might confuse desire 
4968.4,"for attachment or might confuse love for attachment, "
4973.83,but that there's a sequence of recruitment 
4976.78,of these neural circuits that's established first 
4979.64,from the pursuit of someone to mate with. 
4982.44,And she's placed us in the context of more modern dating 
4986.83,"themes where depending on culture, people might explore "
4992.64,"several, maybe many, many individuals before, "
4995.99,"quote, unquote, settling down with somebody, "
4998.77,at least for some period of time. 
5001.1,I think that's an interesting framework 
5003.48,"because it circumvents a lot of the, frankly, unanswerable "
5008.65,questions about whether or not humans were meant 
5012.33,to be monogamous or whether or not they weren't. 
5014.22,"Those are conversations that hold cultural context, "
5017.11,"that hold all sorts of context, "
5019.77,that really can't be addressed in a laboratory setting. 
5022.75,But this idea that sex drive is a way to forage 
5026.76,for potential love partners and that love is a litmus test 
5031.3,for whether or not longer term or deeper attachments 
5034.64,"can and will form, is one that at least makes sense to me. "
5038.38,"Later in the episode, we'll talk about this notion "
5040.446,of sex drive and desire. 
5042.77,I'll actually talk about some tools that have very strong 
5046.95,data really to support them in terms of things that people 
5050.36,"can do or take to increase libido, both men and women, "
5054.57,because there's actually quite good data on that now. 
5057.35,"But in the meantime, I want to talk about some of the work "
5060.49,that Dr. Fisher has done in terms 
5062.33,of categorizing people into... 
5065.26,"Again, we have four groups. "
5067.16,"These are distinct from the A, B, C, and D "
5070.3,attachment styles described earlier. 
5072.22,"Although as I describe them, "
5073.66,you might be able to map them somewhat onto those. 
5076.4,And these four groups are groups that were defined 
5081.51,"through her studies of people that were, or are, "
5084.96,"I don't know if they were or if they are still on match.com, "
5089.6,but a very extensive dataset. 
5091.64,"So again, millions if not tens of millions of individuals. "
5095.16,"The number I heard her quote, "
5096.67,"and forgive me if this is not accurate, "
5099.27,is that in upwards of 
40,"million individuals, "
5104.37,in terms of whether or not their neurochemical 
5106.85,and hormone systems are tuned 
5108.81,toward particular types of behaviors. 
5112.4,What do I mean by that? 
5113.33,"Well, both men and women, males and females "
5117.24,have both testosterone and estrogen. 
5119.3,"Typically, again, these are averages, but typically "
5122.03,"men have more testosterone than they do estrogen, "
5124.68,"and they have more testosterone than do women, "
5126.92,and less estrogen then do women. 
5128.65,Typically women have more estrogen 
5130.66,"than they do testosterone, again, averages. "
5134.32,"And they have less testosterone than men, "
5138.27,"more estrogen than men, and so on and so forth. "
5140.9,But both hormone systems are active 
5142.95,in both sets of individuals. 
5146.45,"And of course, all humans, as far as we know, "
5150.31,manufacture both dopamine and serotonin. 
5153.08,"Dopamine, as I mentioned earlier, has a number of effects "
5156.58,in the brain and body. 
5157.413,But one of the primary effects is that it places us 
5159.44,into states of motivation and pursuit for various things. 
5163.4,There is somewhat close relationship between the dopamine 
5167.66,"system and the testosterone system in the hypothalamus, "
5171.8,this brain area above the roof of your mouth. 
5173.36,"And the pituitary gland, which is responsible "
5175.61,"for making hormones that make the ovaries and or testes, "
5181.5,secrete testosterone or estrogen. 
5183.194,So there's a lot of signaling that occurs such that dopamine 
5187.567,and testosterone tend to operate as close cousins 
5191.66,in a system of pursuit. 
5193.4,"And conversely, the serotonin system tends to on average "
5197.35,collaborate with the estrogen system to impart certain 
5201.25,physiological functions and behaviors. 
5203.46,"So these aren't hard and fast, or I guess better stated, "
5208.41,"these aren't strict black and white categorizations, "
5211.45,but I think those general themes hold 
5213.51,when you look at the animal and human data. 
5216.52,"So Dr. Fisher has taken some liberties, but I think they are "
5221.99,"what I would call logically, and scientifically, "
5224.21,and neurobiologically grounded liberties 
5226.79,in classifying individuals who are on these dating sites 
5230.57,according to the types of things they report 
5233.01,about themselves and the type of people they tend 
5235.5,"to match with on these dating sites, "
5239.11,and created these four categories. 
5242.62,"The four categories are, she calls one, "
5245.068,the dopamine category. 
5247.77,So these are people who would have high dopamine. 
5250.47,"And again, that's just a name. "
5254.0,"It doesn't mean they have low anything else, "
5256.81,but they are high on the dopamine scale. 
5259.49,People who rate high on the dopamine scale tend to be 
5263.44,what the scientists and psychologists call 
5265.19,"high sensation seeking, novel seeking. "
5267.09,"They like new things, they like spontaneity, "
5269.84,they tend to be very adventurous. 
5271.49,And I think that's largely true. 
5272.94,If you look at the conditions 
5275.1,"where dopamine is super physiological, "
5279.5,it's elevated beyond abnormal levels. 
5282.71,Things like mania or when people take certain drugs 
5286.5,"of abuse, like cocaine or amphetamine "
5288.69,"that really raise dopamine levels up very, very high. "
5292.55,"For some period of time, they do tend to increase "
5295.63,energy motivation and novelty seeking. 
5298.09,"And of course, drugs like amphetamine and cocaine "
5300.1,have all sorts of deleterious effects 
5302.16,"that I don't need to go into here, "
5303.21,but it's worth pointing out. 
5304.9,But they don't tend to make people calm and relaxed 
5307.3,and seek soothing interactions. 
5310.73,"Conversely, the group that Dr. Fisher calls "
5314.16,the serotonin group tend to be more grounded 
5320.24,"in soothing activities, quiescent type activities. "
5323.43,"They actually tend to be, on average, "
5325.61,"they tend to like rules and follow rules, "
5327.79,"they tend to be homebodies, this sort of thing. "
5330.22,"They're really, you can imagine them this stable types, "
5333.69,but they really like stability. 
5335.01,"They're not really into spontaneity as much, "
5337.32,"again, averages. "
5338.35,"And then she created two other categories, "
5341.42,the testosterone category of high testosterone. 
5344.63,"This again, could be males or females. "
5347.64,"And then the estrogen category, "
5350.81,"again, could be males or females. "
5352.11,And she gave these different names 
5353.917,that I won't go into here. 
5355.73,"You can look up her work online, "
5357.02,"but she names like the director, and the follower, "
5360.48,and things like that. 
5361.313,But I don't really want to use those as much as I want to stick 
5363.04,to the biological terms. 
5364.66,"So we have dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen. "
5368.47,"Now that might seem like an unfair overgeneralization, "
5373.64,but what's interesting is not necessarily the name 
5376.89,"or the neurochemical system, right? "
5378.65,"Those could have just been called category one, two, three "
5381.35,and four for all that matters here. 
5385.32,What is interesting is seeing how those different groups 
5389.56,of individuals that she absolutely can categorize 
5393.29,based on their self-reported preferences 
5397.12,about behaviors and certain kinds of interactions. 
5399.96,How those groups tend to pair up with people 
5403.08,in the same or opposite categories. 
5405.41,So what her studies reveal is that people that fall 
5408.51,"into the high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, "
5411.1,"spontaneity category, the one that she calls "
5413.43,"the high dopamine category tend to pair up with, at least "
5417.64,"in the short term, tend to pair up with people "
5421.19,who are also in that dopaminergic category. 
5423.76,So these would be people that would spontaneously 
5426.99,take a trip or explore something new or new restaurant. 
5430.03,They tend to be creative and explorative types. 
5434.49,"So that group on average tends to date and mate, "
5440.01,and potentially form long-term 
5442.37,relationships within category. 
5444.47,"Again, averages. "
5446.04,Individuals that she placed into the serotonin group 
5449.93,"or what she hypothesized would be a high serotonin group, "
5452.96,"again, they didn't measure serotonin, "
5454.388,"but people that tend to place value on stability, on rules, "
5459.68,on certain forms of traditional organization 
5463.84,"at home and in relationships, "
5465.59,"those people also tended to pair up with select date, "
5471.46,we presume mate with and form stable relationships 
5474.72,with people in the same category. 
5477.28,"Now, individuals in the other two categories, "
5479.78,"the high testosterone group, "
5481.56,"and again, testosterone wasn't measured, "
5483.52,"but she called it the high testosterone group, "
5485.57,"but these are people that tend to be very directive, "
5490.87,they tend to know what they want and are comfortable telling 
5493.33,other people what they want. 
5495.57,"And from them, these are individuals that in her studies "
5500.93,"and in other studies tend to be a little bit challenging, "
5504.24,"meaning they not necessarily challenging to be around, "
5507.23,"but they tend to challenge other people, "
5509.49,"push them in order to expand their boundaries, "
5512.77,either for sake of the relationship or just in general. 
5515.89,And the people they tend to push are the people that 
5517.73,"they pair up with, which are the people "
5519.81,"in the estrogen category, what she called high estrogen. "
5522.34,"Again, they didn't measure estrogen, "
5523.84,but the people in the estrogen category were the ones 
5527.63,that described themselves and their choices in life 
5530.9,and their preferences as being nurturing. 
5533.52,They actually seem to like it when someone else 
5536.07,"is making the major decisions, not every decision. "
5539.8,"They certainly like to be heard, of course, "
5542.16,in terms of their preferences. 
5543.47,"But that those two types, what she called the testosterone "
5547.107,and the estrogen type tend to pair up. 
5549.83,So why are these categorizations 
5551.357,"and these averages interesting to me, "
5553.63,at least interesting enough to convey to you? 
5556.3,"The reason they're interesting to me is, "
5558.94,"again, not because of their names, "
5560.49,"these molecules were not measured in these individuals, "
5563.27,but that they once again bring us to the themes 
5566.53,"that we addressed before, "
5568.17,which are the autonomic nervous system and whether or not 
5571.55,it tends to be shifted more towards alertness in action 
5574.9,"or more towards a stable equilibrium or more towards calm, "
5579.63,and whether or not individuals are selecting for people 
5584.53,who have autonomic nervous systems that are more or less 
5587.43,"like theirs before they even meet, right? "
5590.78,"So again, going back to this seesaw analogy, "
5593.96,"it's almost like people who have the flat seesaw, "
5596.69,"alert but calm, but not extremely alert, "
5599.65,"not extremely overly calm in situations but in the middle, "
5605.44,seem to be seeking out people that are also 
5607.67,at that autonomic equilibrium. 
5611.37,"People in the, what she called the dopamine category, "
5613.77,which are really can just be described 
5615.12,"as high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, "
5617.35,they seem to want to pair with one another. 
5619.07,"So there's a selection for similar, "
5622.57,"in two of the groups, autonomic tone. "
5625.73,I find that very interesting because in that decision 
5630.41,"or that preference for similar autonomic tone, "
5633.43,it essentially eliminates a lot of the requirement 
5638.291,for figuring out how to match 
5641.99,one's autonomic nervous system to another. 
5643.344,"They simply find someone with a similar tendency, okay? "
5647.61,Whereas in the other two groups that she called 
5650.6,"testosterone and estrogen, the director type "
5652.78,"and the nurturing somewhat follower type, "
5656.27,"there's an establishment of balance, "
5659.02,"but not in between two who individuals as a match, "
5664.05,but rather on the whole in the relationship. 
5666.95,One person is driving the novelty seeking 
5669.46,"in the course of decisions and actions, "
5671.0,and the other person is essentially agreeing to those. 
5673.85,"Now, assuming that those decisions are good for both people. "
5677.29,"And I emphasize good for both people, "
5679.25,"because one of the themes that Dr. Fisher underscores, "
5682.02,"and I'd like to underscore here as well, "
5684.07,is that it need not be the case that people pair up 
5688.83,exactly according to these categorizations 
5691.03,"that I've described, dopamine with dopamine, "
5693.74,"serotonin with serotonin, testosterone with estrogen, "
5696.197,and so on. 
5697.76,What is important is that there be a recognition 
5700.96,"and a respect for the other types, "
5703.79,or a recognition and a respect for the fact that 
5706.58,both are of the same type. 
5708.2,"You could actually imagine, for instance, that two people "
5710.82,"of this high sensation seeking, novelty seeking "
5714.06,"could have a terrifically exciting relationship, "
5716.56,but that it actually might be a relationship 
5720.41,"in which the financial stability isn't quite there, "
5723.67,or in which the basic stability isn't there. 
5727.05,"You could imagine, for instance, a situation "
5730.7,in which a relationship between two people 
5732.94,of what she called the high serotonin preference 
5737.22,"would have a relationship that was actually dull, "
5739.67,"in which both of them found themselves bored at some point, "
5742.72,or in which there wasn't enough of the dynamic tension 
5747.48,that sometimes is required in order to keep this cycle 
5751.04,"of desire, love, and attachment going. "
5752.58,Something that we will talk about in a moment. 
5755.06,So the point here is not that one should necessarily pair up 
5759.93,according to these arrangements that I described. 
5762.94,"The point is that on average, that's what tends to happen. "
5766.63,And that through a recognition that these categorizations 
5770.71,exist similar to the recognition that the type 
5775.32,"A, B, C, and D infant and toddler type attachments exist, "
5779.97,that we can gain better self-awareness of who we are 
5783.69,"and how we tend to show up in romantic attachments, "
5786.83,"and thereby navigate healthier mate seeking, "
5791.96,"healthier breakups, if the case dictates it, "
5796.42,and in some cases healthy long-term relationships 
5799.38,by understanding that the other person can either be similar 
5802.47,or complimentary to us. 
5804.72,One is neither better than the other. 
5807.1,"It's simply the case that in all romantic attachments, "
5810.72,"from the initial inception of the romantic attachment, "
5814.58,"desire, love, and attachment, "
5818.12,there is an autonomic coordination. 
5821.06,And of course there's coordination of all sorts 
5823.25,"of other things like food, sex, and sleep, and finances, "
5827.9,"and where people are going to live, and many other features, "
5830.66,but that at the core of all that is a seeking 
5834.33,of either autonomic likeness or autonomic differences. 
5839.11,And I think that recognition can be extremely valuable 
5842.7,in thinking about tools to enter and maintain relationships. 
5847.11,"If one thinks about their autonomic nervous system, "
5850.43,not simply as something that is driven by external people 
5854.43,"and events, but that we can actually gain some control over "
5857.97,through techniques of the sort that I talked about earlier 
5860.44,"and on previous podcasts, "
5861.88,"but also generally, if we are able to adjust "
5865.17,our autonomic nervous system in order to at least appreciate 
5869.23,"or get some empathy into what someone else is experiencing, "
5873.16,then we gain actual cognitive empathy. 
5876.42,"And this episode isn't about empathy per se, "
5880.13,but the theme keeps coming up again and again. 
5881.92,And I think it's worth mentioning that when you talk 
5884.33,"to psychologists, whether or not they're psychoanalyst "
5887.42,"or from another source of training, "
5890.01,what you find is that they don't talk about empathy 
5892.35,"as a general term, they will talk about emotional empathy, "
5896.67,they'll talk about cognitive empathy. 
5898.34,And what I'm talking about here today is that 
5900.25,yet a third category that is very strongly determinant 
5904.21,"of relationship dynamics, and that's autonomic empathy. "
5907.96,"I'm a biologist, I'm not a psychologist. "
5910.64,So I love mechanism. 
5912.35,And fortunately there are studies that have been done 
5915.7,recently using modern techniques 
5917.88,to look at neural mechanisms of romantic attachment. 
5921.63,I mentioned earlier some of the brain imaging studies 
5924.81,that have been done on child and mother literally imaging 
5929.76,"the activity of neurons in the brain as child is nursing, "
5932.84,"or as a mother is soothing baby, "
5935.0,"and as you learned earlier, baby is soothing mother as well. "
5939.45,Those are remarkable studies. 
5940.42,You may have seen some of these pictures online. 
5942.12,"You can see the silhouette of the infant and mother, "
5944.57,and their brains and even some of the brain activation 
5947.37,"patterns, really, really beautiful studies. "
5949.63,Similar studies have been done in romantic couples 
5953.93,"with those couples, either touching one another, "
5957.17,"touching and kissing, or in clever, I think, "
5960.72,"control experiments of the person just touching a pillow, "
5963.284,"[laughs] or something, or kissing a pillow "
5966.46,in order to try and create the most reasonable control 
5970.51,for what are actually pretty 
5971.96,complicated interpersonal dynamics 
5973.436,to do in a brain imaging scanner. 
5976.77,But some of the other studies that have been done recently 
5980.07,involved so called EEG. 
5981.27,So these are electrical recordings 
5982.96,"that are done noninvasively, "
5984.93,putting a bunch of electrodes on the outside of the scalp. 
5987.57,"EEG is useful in that you can do it noninvasively, "
5992.34,"you can do it while people are moving and doing things, "
5996.38,"kissing, touching, et cetera. "
5998.85,It doesn't allow one to image or to evaluate neural activity 
6003.16,very deeply in the brain. 
6004.64,So you can miss out on a lot of things. 
6006.39,It's like looking at the wave structure on the ocean 
6008.92,without actually looking into the depths of the ocean. 
6012.32,"So you can miss certain things, "
6013.64,"but if you see things generally you trust they're there, "
6017.02,but you can't see what you don't see. 
6018.66,"Nonetheless, there's some studies "
6021.09,that I'll just point you to and that form the segue 
6024.66,"for what I'm going to discuss in a moment, "
6027.44,which is a study published in Scientific Reports in 
"2021,",
6033.08,"entitled ""Investigating Real Life Emotions "
6035.28,"in Romantic Couples: a Mobile EEG Study."" "
6037.96,"So this is, as the title suggests, having people wear "
6041.88,"these EEG caps of electrodes, get engage in very passionate, "
6047.36,"emotional kisses, emotional speech toward one another "
6050.56,standing at different distances. 
6051.71,So a lot of cool stuff that you can do that you really 
6054.16,"couldn't do in a brain scanner, because in a brain scanner, "
6056.87,"people have to be there usually in a bite bar, "
6058.97,they're actually jaw flicked like this. 
6060.43,I've been in one of these things. 
6062.42,"There's not a lot of moving around to be heard, "
6063.85,at least not using the current technology. 
6067.07,"In any case, what they found was "
6069.51,"there is a shift in brain waves, brain states, "
6074.23,things like alpha waves or just a particular frequency 
6076.76,"of brain waves in the neocortex, the outer shell "
6079.54,of the brain just beneath the skull. 
6082.19,And in people that are kissing or in people that are engaged 
6086.68,"in romantic speech, or I didn't actually hear what they said "
6091.19,"to one another, but what the couple seems exciting, "
6094.54,"romantic and arousing to them, they see more alpha wave "
6098.16,activity compared to the control conditions. 
6100.33,"And there was some what we call lateralization, "
6102.7,where the left hemisphere was more active than the right 
6104.75,and so forth. 
6106.78,And these studies are important because we know that 
6110.43,the autonomic nervous systems of individuals tend 
6113.45,to start to collaborate and actually synchronize 
6118.03,"at the level of heartbeats, at the level of breathing "
6121.26,during romantic interactions of different kinds. 
6123.6,But these studies are some of the first 
6125.29,of their kind to start looking 
6126.55,at neural synchronization between individuals. 
6129.92,"Now, the simple version of looking at this "
6134.27,"and the way I would've thought this would all go was, "
6137.21,"okay, two people start kissing, they start talking "
6139.64,about what they find particularly romantic 
6141.59,and arousing for them. 
6142.423,And their brain waves will just match to one another. 
6144.85,And that's really the basis of romantic attachment 
6148.377,and romantic engagement in that sort of thing. 
6152.3,But it turns out that the opposite is true. 
6156.33,"So a really nice study published in a really fine journal, "
6160.85,Cerebral Cortex is a journal that I've known 
6162.85,"about for many years, they published strong anatomy, "
6164.84,physiology and neuroimaging. 
6166.78,"There's a study that was published, first author, Kajimura, "
6172.59,and this paper really points... 
6174.6,"Again, this is "
2021.,
6176.99,"And the title of this paper is, "
6178.627,"""Brain Knows Who Is on the Same Wavelength: "
6181.11,Resting-State Connectivity Can Predict Compatibility 
6184.05,"of a Female-Male Relationship."" "
6186.41,Now what this study did was a little bit different. 
6188.84,They looked at the resting or default mode 
6191.75,activity of the brain. 
6192.89,"So rather than evoked activity, as it's called, "
6195.92,"where people are kissing or are engaged in some activity, "
6199.44,"this was a neuroimaging study, not EEG, but fMRI, "
6204.17,"functional magnetic resonance imaging, "
6205.83,"which is similar to EEG in principle, "
6209.19,but allows you to look deep into the brain. 
6211.41,And it has a very good resolution in time and space. 
6215.49,So fast events can be monitored and the precise location 
6220.0,of those events can be monitored somewhat better than EEG. 
6223.64,And there are exceptions to this. 
6224.78,So for you EEGers out there. 
6226.38,EEG don't come after me with electrodes. 
6230.37,Just understand that fMRI gives you a fuller picture 
6234.2,of what's going on. 
6235.15,And what Kajimura et al found was that contrary 
6239.55,"to what your reflexive prediction might be, "
6245.01,people tend to select people that have resting brain states 
6250.08,"that different than theirs, "
6251.99,or sometimes they found that are actually opposite 
6255.24,to their own resting brain state. 
6257.31,"And you might say, ""Well, that doesn't make any sense. "
6259.36,"I thought this is all about autonomic coordination."" "
6262.29,But actually if we go back to Helen Fisher's categorizations 
6265.702,"of the dopamine types, the sensation seeking types, "
6268.65,"that is serotonin, the stable rule following types, "
6273.21,"testosterone and estrogen types, "
6274.53,remember that the two categories that she called 
6276.91,"testosterone and estrogen type, "
6278.18,"the director and the follower, the nurturer, "
6280.72,"I guess it would be the more accurate way, "
6282.18,"the director and the nurturer, "
6283.94,"those tend to pair up across categories, "
6286.75,not within category. 
6288.46,And so I think what's really needed for this field 
6291.46,"which to my knowledge hasn't happened yet, "
6293.7,is to really start to map the neuroanatomical 
6298.057,"and neurophysiological findings of, in this case, "
6301.16,"that resting brain state is in one form in one individual, "
6306.79,and they tend to seek out people whose resting brain state 
6309.29,"is different than theirs, not similar. "
6311.93,That needs to be mapped onto the more subjective 
6315.53,psychological categorizations that Helen Fisher 
6319.37,"and indeed the Gottman's and others have created, "
6322.02,that sort of the state of the field now. 
6324.03,"And I mentioned this not to confuse you, "
6326.43,"but to the contrary, to illustrate that it's not just "
6330.06,"about finding someone just like you, "
6332.1,and it's not just about finding someone 
6334.43,who's opposite to you. 
6335.92,This is actually the reason that I decided to become 
6338.03,"a biologist at some point in my life, which is that "
6341.62,"we can find verbal sayings, and stories, and examples "
6344.61,to support just about anything. 
6347.22,"This is not a knock on the field of psychology, "
6349.18,as you can probably tell from today's episode. 
6350.87,I have great respect for in reverence 
6352.61,"for the field of psychology, especially its collaboration "
6355.99,with neuroscience and vice versa. 
6358.1,"But in the popular culture, "
6360.75,we can find examples and sayings that support essentially 
6364.04,anything as it relates to a relationship. 
6366.4,"For instance, I've heard and you've probably heard, "
6368.9,absence makes the heart grow fonder. 
6370.9,And indeed I've experienced that and I believe it's true. 
6374.01,But I also have experienced and I believe to be true 
6376.41,that out of sight out of mind also exists 
6378.83,and that there will be a biological mechanism for that. 
6381.69,The point here is that matching of same to same 
6384.8,or same to different can both be effective in creating 
6387.558,"the desire, love, attachment process. "
6392.88,"It's a matter of, who is looking for same, "
6396.16,and who is looking for different? 
6397.39,"And there, I think Dr. Fisher and the work "
6400.15,of these neurophysiologist and brain imagers 
6402.73,really does point in a direction whereby 
6405.25,there is not one form of attachment 
6408.96,that is going to be wholly above [indistinct] 
6411.28,will predict good outcomes. 
6413.12,"There is not going to be a case in which opposites attract, "
6416.55,and that's always the best rule to follow. 
6418.153,"Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't. "
6421.32,There is also not the case that people tend 
6423.32,to pair up with similar. 
6425.34,"Sometimes it will be the case, sometimes it won't. "
6428.14,Now there are certain statistics 
6429.673,that support that statement. 
6431.36,"For instance, people, on average, "
6433.69,people pair up with individuals of similar educational 
6437.32,"background, income, and attractiveness. "
6439.17,"That is true on average, but it's not always the case. "
6442.42,"And again, a knowledge of and a respect for the different "
6446.15,"categorizations of attachment, the different categorizations "
6448.786,"of mate seeking described by Fisher and others, "
6451.61,and the recognition that matching of autonomic nervous 
6454.39,systems but also mismatching of resting state brain networks 
6458.6,are all at play in driving what we are calling 
6461.65,"desire, love and attachment. "
6463.49,So in keeping with the exploration of the fact that 
6465.66,"there's a saying, or a book, or a song, or an example "
6469.32,"of pretty much any relationship dynamic, "
6472.32,I want to now talk about an article that came out a little 
6475.5,over 
10,years ago that talked about the universality of love 
6481.41,and the ability to fall in love. 
6482.85,So this would be very much in line 
6484.16,with the George Bernard Shaw quote that I mentioned earlier 
6486.61,"that ""Love is really overestimating "
6489.13,"the differences between individuals."" "
6490.67,"And again, I should say that is not something "
6492.16,"that I personally believe, "
6493.72,although maybe I'm just diluting myself. 
6495.63,I like to think that the people that we fall in love 
6498.38,"with are really special for us, "
6501.98,that they could not easily be replaced with anybody else. 
6505.63,That's simply my stance. 
6506.98,I'm not basing that 
6507.87,on any hardcore neurobiological mechanism. 
6511.61,"But nonetheless, an article was published "
6515.24,in The New York Times in 
2015,that related 
6518.39,"to some psychological studies that were done, "
6522.42,"as well as some clinical work, as well as some, "
6524.61,what I would call pop psychology or things that fall 
6528.18,outside the domains of academic science. 
6530.73,And the whole basis of this article was 
6536.33,
36,questions that lead to love. 
6538.98,And it involved a listing out indeed of 
36,"questions, "
6543.42,"divided into set one, set two, and set three that progressed "
6547.17,from somewhat ordinary questions about life experience 
6551.39,"and self-report to more, "
6554.64,let's call them deep questions about people's values 
6558.142,and things that are emotionally close to them. 
6560.24,And I'll just give an example of a few of these. 
6561.99,You can find this easily online by just putting 
6564.69,"into your search engine, "
36,questions that lead to love. 
6567.96,"Some of the questions in set number one, where for instance, "
6571.72,what would constitute a perfect day for you? 
6575.4,For what in your life do you feel most grateful? 
6577.12,Kind of standard questionnaire stuff. 
6578.69,"In set two, what is your most treasured memory? "
6581.97,What is your most terrible memory? 
6583.42,"So these, as you can tell, are drilling a little bit deeper "
6586.02,into one's personal experience and emotional system. 
6589.27,"And then set three, questions "
25,through 
36,"are things, "
6596.55,what is a very embarrassing moment in your life? 
6600.28,When did you last cry in front of another person 
6603.127,and by yourself? 
6604.97,What is something that's too serious to be joked about? 
6607.11,So it's going deeper into one's emotional system. 
6611.01,"And even questions like, of all the people in your family, "
6613.78,whose death would you find most disturbing and why? 
6616.69,"So pretty, pretty heavy stuff there at the end. "
6619.2,"Now, the reason this article got so much traction, "
6621.76,and the reason I'm bringing it up today is that 
6623.85,there was a statement that was made in and around 
6627.44,this article that if two people went on a date 
6632.41,"or simply sat down and asked each other these questions, "
6636.52,and each answered these questions and the other was paying 
6641.97,attention carefully and at some level emotionally responding 
6647.24,"or not out responding, but certainly paying attention "
6648.683,"to the answers of the other person, "
6651.18,"that by the end of that exchange, where one person asks "
6655.8,
36,questions and the other person answers all 
"36,",
6658.61,and then the other person asks all 
36,and the other person 
6661.92,answers all 
"36,","that they would fall in love, right? "
6665.66,Which seems like a ridiculous thing. 
6667.97,And yet it is the case that people who go 
6671.95,through this exercise report feeling as if they know 
6676.4,the other person quite well and feeling certain levels 
6680.6,of attachment or even love and desire for the other person 
6683.8,"that they were, would not have predicted, excuse me, "
6687.23,would not have predicted 
6689.26,had they not gone through that process. 
6691.22,So what's going on in this exchange of questions 
6692.578,and answers of a progressively more emotional 
6696.67,and deep level? 
6698.58,"Well, what I predict is going on is that inside "
6701.31,"of that exchange, people are creating a delusional story "
6706.13,about the nature of the exchange being a reflection 
6709.6,of some deeper attachment. 
6711.28,"And so even though people are just exchanging words, "
6714.01,"they're not physically touching, they are not, at least not "
6717.77,at the point where they're running these kinds 
6720.738,of questionnaire studies. 
6723.51,"They may touch afterwards for all I know, "
6725.4,"and probably did in some cases, "
6726.734,but they're not exchanging life experience 
6729.78,in an immediate way. 
6731.35,They're not actually going off into the world 
6733.19,and doing things together yet. 
6735.06,They are simply exchanging narrative. 
6737.84,But we know based on recent studies and I've covered 
6741.76,"this before on this podcast, but I'll mention again, "
6744.19,"there was a study published in Cell Reports, "
6747.26,"a Cell Press journal, excellent journal "
6749.4,"showing that when individuals listen to the same narrative, "
6753.93,their heart rates tend to synchronize 
6755.147,"or at least follow a very similar pattern, "
6757.8,even if they're not in the same room 
6759.51,listening to a given narrative. 
6761.15,"Whereas in this case, people are facing one another "
6764.21,listening to the narratives of each other. 
6766.69,Certainly they are having autonomic responses. 
6769.96,And it stands to reason that their autonomic nervous systems 
6773.15,are synchronizing much in the same way that 
6775.25,the Cell Report study found that people will synchronize 
6778.41,"their autonomic nervous systems to a shared, "
6781.74,heard story from another. 
6783.85,"In other words, whether or not we hear a story, "
6786.28,"watch a movie, listen to a song, "
6788.52,"or exchange our own individual stories, "
6791.33,our autonomic nervous systems have the potential 
6793.6,to map onto one another. 
6795.04,So I'm not all that surprised that people find 
6798.86,"that they fall in love, in quotes, "
6801.87,"after answering these questions to one another, "
6804.24,because essentially the way these questions 
6805.88,are laid out is they establish a narrative. 
6808.98,They establish a very personal narrative 
6810.93,and the other person is listening very closely. 
6812.277,And we don't have physiological or brain imaging studies 
6815.97,"to support what I'm about to say, "
6818.67,but the reasonable interpretation is that 
6822.12,that's causing some autonomic synchronization. 
6825.47,So if you want to try this on a date or even it's actually 
6828.8,been hypothesized that this could be useful 
6831.4,"for existing couples, even if they already know the answers "
6834.99,to some of these questions. 
6836.05,And that doesn't surprise me either. 
6837.78,I think the autonomic coordination is present 
6839.85,"during mating behavior, "
6842.44,"it's present during shared experience of the outside world, "
6845.91,"movies, concerts, watching one's children "
6848.81,"with somebody else, et cetera. "
6850.031,And it's established by sharing one's own narrative 
6853.45,of their own personal experience. 
6855.17,So I don't want to seem overly reductionist. 
6857.43,"I'll never propose that all of our sensation, perception, "
6861.53,action and experience in life boils down to us just being 
6865.02,"bags of chemicals and the action of those chemicals, "
6868.06,or any aspect of our nervous system. 
6869.253,And yet in looking across the psychological literature 
6874.56,"of development of attachment, in the psychological "
6877.19,"literature of adult and romantic attachment, "
6880.09,"and what makes and breaks those attachments, "
6883.41,it's very clear to me. 
6884.88,"And I think courses through the literature multiple levels, "
6888.4,that autonomic coordination is absolutely key 
6892.41,"for the establishment of desire, love and attachment. "
6895.66,"In fact, I talked earlier about how our actual conception "
6898.58,is born out of autonomic coordination 
6900.87,of one sort or another. 
6902.6,"So again, it doesn't necessarily mean that autonomic nervous "
6906.5,systems always be synchronized in the case of the two 
6909.46,categorizations that Fisher proposed 
6911.82,of the director/testosterone type 
6914.38,and the nurturing follower/estrogen type. 
6920.22,It was actually the coordination but in opposite directions 
6924.67,of individuals that fall into each of those categories 
6927.33,that led to more stable attachments 
6928.643,"or the seeking out of those attachments, I should say. "
6931.84,"But nonetheless, it's, at least to my mind, very clear "
6935.61,that autonomic coordination is a hallmark feature 
6939.39,"of desire, a hallmark feature of what we call love, "
6944.25,and a hallmark feature of what we call attachment. 
6947.11,And that the breaking of attachments were the failures 
6951.06,"of desire, the failures of love, "
6953.95,and the failures of attachment over time 
6956.74,in line with the work of Gottman and others. 
6958.66,And in even just simply what's required for mating behavior 
6962.57,is also reflected in the autonomic nervous system. 
6965.7,"But in that case, a failure to coordinate "
6967.91,the autonomic nervous systems in some sort of concerted way. 
6971.38,"Any discussion about desire, love, and attachment "
6974.24,would be incomplete 
6975.96,if we didn't talk about the dreaded infidelity and cheating. 
6980.42,Much has been made of infidelity and cheating 
6982.36,and whether or not people who are higher on dopamine 
6984.85,and sensation seeking tend to cheat more or less. 
6987.41,"Frankly, I don't think there's any solid evidence for that. "
6991.75,I think there are a lot of examples that we can draw 
6993.71,from in our own lives and in the lives of others 
6996.83,"that would generally support one or the other model, "
6999.59,but I'm not aware of any decent physiological studies 
7003.41,or psychological studies that really point to that. 
7006.29,"For instance, I would never say that the serotonergic "
7010.06,"phenotype as described by Fisher is less prone to cheat, "
7014.8,or that the people who have an insecure attachment 
7018.63,"are more likely to cheat, et cetera, for instance. "
7022.01,I don't think those correlations have been drawn 
7024.45,in any kind of meaningful way yet. 
7025.88,So I would be cautious about assigning them 
7029.33,without that evidence. 
7031.4,"However, there are some interesting studies involving, "
7034.64,"again, neuroimaging and some subjective measures in humans, "
7038.9,meaning asking them questions 
7040.33,that they're good ways to tease out lies from truths 
7043.81,in these sorts of studies and whether or not people tend 
7048.28,to find their partner or others more or less attractive 
7053.5,depending on how people feel about themselves. 
7056.48,And I think this is a very interesting aspect 
7059.47,"to desire, love, and attachment for the following reason. "
7063.92,You hear a lot out out there that in order 
7067.14,"to form a really strong relationship, "
7069.95,"you have to have a good relationship with yourself, "
7071.842,or you have to love yourself. 
7074.42,Or you often hear for instance that it's exactly when you're 
7079.73,not looking for a relationship that you're going to find one. 
7082.02,"You hear this stuff, right? "
7083.43,But none of that is really grounded in any studies. 
7085.8,"Again, that's like out of sight out of mind, "
7087.041,or absence makes the heart grow fonder. 
7089.36,There are many life examples to support those statements. 
7093.5,And there are many life examples 
7094.917,to support statements to the opposite. 
7099.07,There's a particular study that I found. 
7101.7,"This was published in Frontiers in Psychology, "
7103.95,but it's a experimental study that involves neuroimaging. 
7108.02,"The title of this study is ""Manipulation of Self-Expansion "
7111.78,"Alters Responses to Attractive Alternative Partners."" "
7115.5,And I love the design of this study. 
7117.19,What they did in this study is they took couples 
7120.54,and they evaluated members of that relationship 
7124.56,for what's called self-expansion. 
7126.078,Now self-expansion is a metric that involves 
7131.84,one's perception of self 
7133.38,as seen through the relationship to the other. 
7136.83,"And this is something that was developed by, "
7139.9,the authors are Aron and Aron. 
7142.38,So they have the same last name. 
7143.48,So I'm assuming this was either a sibling team 
7145.95,or a somehow related team or a romantic couple team. 
7150.21,"A-R-O-N and A-R-O-N, Aron and Aron, in "
"1986,",
7155.78,proposed this self-expansion model of close relationships. 
7158.71,"And they proposed ""That people are motivated "
7160.64,"to enter relationships..."" "
7161.72,I'm reading here. 
7162.553,"""In order to enhance the self and increase self-efficacy."" "
7165.83,"In other words, that one of the reasons why many people "
7168.78,enter relationships is that it makes us feel good 
7171.1,about ourselves and more capable. 
7172.46,"And I would see that as a healthy interdependence, "
7174.9,not necessarily codependence. 
7178.38,This is especially strong at the beginning 
7179.961,"of a relationship, it turns out, "
7181.59,"when people are forming pair bonds, "
7183.69,"and it's the case that pleasure, arousal and excitement, "
7188.34,"again, all hallmark features "
7190.69,"of autonomic nervous system function, "
7192.49,"pleasure, arousal and excitement, "
7195.42,"give rise to self-expansion, meaning to self-efficacy. "
7199.14,So what this self-expansion model is really about is 
7202.97,how great other people that we are close to and romantically 
7206.15,"attached to can potentially make us feel, "
7209.47,"in terms of what they say, in terms of what they do, "
7212.73,in terms of the way in which we believe they feel about us. 
7218.17,So it doesn't necessarily have to involve explicit 
7220.88,"statements of them telling us how great we are, "
7224.07,"or them doing great gestures for us, "
7227.1,but how we actually feel they feel about us. 
7230.28,Turns out to be a very strong parameter in terms 
7232.78,of how we feel about ourselves and the relationship overall. 
7236.25,"Now, some of you out there are probably thinking, "
7237.707,"""Oh yeah, isn't there this thing "
7238.86,"of the love languages?"" Right? "
7240.85,"I don't have any neuroscience to support, I think, "
7242.88,"the love languages, I'm not super familiar with this, "
7244.777,"and I didn't list it out, but that some people are... "
7249.32,"Their autonomic nervous system, if you will, "
7252.09,"tends to be very responsive to gifts, or to quality time, "
7256.47,"or to physical touch, or acts of kindness. "
7258.23,I think I've got a few of these right. 
7259.31,I probably have a few wrong. 
7260.28,"Anyway, they're easy to find online. "
7261.67,And people do tend to have a bias toward two or three 
7265.42,of these things that are especially 
7266.76,meaningful for them. 
7267.88,"And when I hear meaningful, I hear they tend to push "
7270.38,the autonomic nervous system and neurochemical systems 
7272.97,of the brain and body in a direction that makes us feel good 
7275.54,as opposed to lousy or neutral. 
7278.06,"In any event, this study looked at whether or not "
7282.3,people have high levels of self-expansion 
7286.41,through the actions or statements 
7289.06,"of their significant other, and how that influences "
7292.275,their perception of people outside the relationship. 
7296.25,Meaning how attractive they perceive people 
7298.98,"outside the relationship to be, "
7300.87,turns out to be strongly influenced 
7303.28,"by, A, whether or not their self-expansion is very strongly "
7310.27,"driven by the other person that they are involved with, "
7313.164,"that they're in the romantic relationship with, "
7315.47,and whether or not that's being expressed to them. 
7317.6,So here's how the study went. 
7319.391,"First of all, they rated or categorized individuals "
7323.91,on the basis of the self-expansion metric. 
7326.18,Some people have more of a potential to experience 
7329.98,"self-expansion through others, right? "
7331.83,"Some of us feel great about ourselves and we're topped off, "
7335.07,"the others don't feel so great about themselves, "
7337.88,"but they can feel much better in response to praise, "
7340.38,in particular praise or self-expansion type behaviors 
7343.84,or statements from people that we really care about. 
7345.86,And still other people are a mixture of the two. 
7348.24,They moderate levels of both. 
7350.37,So they rated them on this scale. 
7352.01,And then they had people 
7353.44,experience self-expansion narratives. 
7357.25,They heard their significant others say really terrific 
7359.81,"things about them and about the relationship, in particular, "
7362.87,"that the relationship that they have was exciting, "
7366.06,novel and challenging. 
7367.37,So that was one form of self-expansion. 
7369.08,And they went into some detail as to why that was the case 
7371.6,in their particular relationship. 
7372.977,Or they heard a narrative from their significant other 
7377.91,about strong feelings of love between the two 
7382.21,that had been experienced previously in the relationship. 
7384.64,"So in the one case, it directed more towards them. "
7387.67,"And in the other case, "
7388.503,it's more about the relationship itself. 
7390.58,And then they did brain imaging of one person 
7394.47,in the relationship while that person assessed 
7397.13,the attractiveness of people outside the relationship. 
7401.15,And what they found was that people who were primed 
7403.9,for this self-expansion had lower activation of brain areas 
7409.47,associated with assessing others' attractiveness 
7412.59,than did the people who experienced a lot of self-expansion. 
7416.65,"Now the takeaway from that, at least the way I read "
7420.01,the study is if you're with somebody who really benefits 
7424.09,"from or experiences a lot of self-expansion, "
7428.72,unless you really want them to pay attention 
7430.54,"to the attractiveness of other people, "
7432.71,it stands to reason that they would benefit 
7436.38,"from more self-expansion type gestures or statements, okay? "
7441.22,Not so much centered on the relationship. 
7442.724,We have such a great relationship. 
7444.61,"There's so much love, it's so great, that too, "
7447.07,"but in the context of this study and these findings, "
7449.7,"that the person is really terrific, that the relationship "
7453.0,"that they've created together is really exciting, "
7454.97,"novel, and challenging, that there's a narrative around "
7457.97,the relationship that really has a lot to do 
7459.709,"with the dynamics between the individuals, in particular, "
7463.02,that the person who really likes self-expansion 
7465.4,"is vital to that dynamic, okay? "
7467.21,So it's not looking down at the relationship 
7468.89,as a set of equals. 
7470.14,There is this bias written into this of that 
7472.55,this person is really essential for the relationship. 
7475.03,I'm not saying this is something that anyone has to do. 
7476.79,I'm not not saying this is right or wrong. 
7478.09,This is just what the data say. 
7480.16,But what's remarkable is that in the absence 
7483.14,"of those statements, people who have, "
7487.14,or that rate high on this scale of self-expansion 
7490.72,rate attractive alternative partners as more attractive. 
7494.5,"Now, that's interesting to me, because it may means that "
7498.07,their actual perception of others is changing. 
7500.89,It's not that their opportunity 
7502.252,"to see others is changing, right? "
7504.94,This is not a matter of them somehow getting access 
7508.44,or no access to attractive alternative partners. 
7511.18,"Again, attractive alternative partners, "
7512.56,"literally the language in the title of this paper, "
7514.98,they're still seeing all these attractive people. 
7517.18,"It's just that if they're feeling filled up, in air quotes, "
7521.49,"psychologically filled up, emotionally filled up, "
7524.647,"autonomically filled, enhanced in the language "
7528.46,"that we're using today by the self-expansion narrative, "
7531.52,well then the same set of attractive faces appear 
7535.32,less attractive to a given individual. 
7538.51,"Now, whether or not this predicts cheating or loyalty, "
7540.944,[laughs] I certainly can't say. 
7543.02,That would be very hard to assess in neuroimaging. 
7545.8,"And there, of course, people rarely if ever "
7550.82,report accurately their cheating behavior. 
7553.24,There's some studies in which confidentiality is assured 
7556.24,to the point where people seem to be more trusting 
7559.2,and willing to reveal cheating behavior. 
7561.83,"But if you look at the statistics on cheating behavior, "
7563.62,it's very hard to track because people lie all the time 
7567.13,about their cheating in and outside of the context 
7569.25,of psychological and neuroimaging studies. 
7572.6,"But I find this study, again, the title, "
7575.267,"""Manipulation of Self-expansion Alters Responses "
7577.68,"to Attractive Alternative Partners"" "
7579.18,"to be absolutely fascinating, because again, it points "
7582.54,to the fact that the interactions with our significant 
7586.83,"others shapes our autonomic arousal, shapes our perception "
7590.48,of self and thereby shapes our perception of other potential 
7595.25,"partners in the outside world, "
7596.78,or shuts us down to the potential of other people 
7600.14,in the outside world. 
7601.5,"So when I hear statements such as, "
7603.04,it's important that you love yourself 
7604.66,"in order to really fall in love with somebody else, "
7607.22,or it is when one is not looking for a relationship 
7611.33,that they're most likely to fall in love 
7612.71,"and form a stable relationship, "
7616.29,I can filter that through these findings to say that 
7619.97,"it's really the person who needs a lot of self-expansion, "
7625.23,stimulating statements or actions coming from other people 
7629.14,that is most prone to seeing other potential partners 
7633.79,out in the world as attractive. 
7635.75,"And in this sense, "
7637.61,we can return to the autonomic nervous system 
7639.69,as a glass that it can be filled up 
7643.43,through various contexts. 
7644.52,It can be filled up through our own ability to regulate it. 
7647.28,It can be filled up through other people's ability 
7650.64,to enhance our sense of wellbeing. 
7652.84,"And in some sense, this points to an idea where it is true "
7657.09,that the better that we can feel about ourselves 
7659.07,in the absence of any self-expansion type input 
7663.56,from somebody else really does place us 
7665.67,"on more stable grounds, such that when we do receive "
7668.17,"that praise, or we do receive those acts of kindness, "
7670.53,"or service, or physical touch or whatever they are, "
7673.28,"that we are able to further enhance the way that we feel, "
7678.75,but that we don't necessarily tether all of our feelings 
7682.17,of self-worth or self-expansion to that one individual. 
7686.68,So you might think that if person A can only receive 
7690.25,"the self-expansion from the statements, from the action "
7694.51,"of the they're involved with, person B, "
7696.75,"that that will form a very stable bond, "
7699.64,but what this study points to is the fact that 
7701.4,that's a very unstable bond. 
7703.52,That person A is actually very susceptible 
7706.19,"to the attractiveness of others, "
7707.48,because they're so desperately attached to this notion 
7710.34,"of self-expansion, even if they don't realize it. "
7712.58,"And so this really does point to the idea that, "
7715.32,"well, it is important to link our autonomic nervous systems "
7718.92,"to establish desire, love, and attachment "
7722.37,that we want to have a stable internal representation 
7725.91,"of ourselves, a stable autonomic nervous system "
7729.16,to some degree in other so that we can be in stable 
7733.33,"romantic partnership with another individual, "
7735.72,if that what we're really trying to do. 
7737.41,"So until now, I've been weaving together studies "
7738.822,from the field of experimental psychology 
7741.99,and the fields of neuroscience in particular neuroimaging. 
7746.17,"But if you recall back to the very beginning of the episode, "
7750.5,"when I was discussing how odors, and how hormones, "
7755.43,and how even birth control can shape people's ratings 
7758.5,"of attractiveness of others, "
7761.79,"you'll realize that there's a deeper layer to all this, "
7764.71,which is that our biology that resides below our conscious 
7770.31,"awareness, things like our hormones, "
7773.22,things like pheromones even are shaping the way 
7778.07,"that we choose, interpret and act with other potential "
7784.23,romantic partners or the romantic partners 
7786.44,that we already have. 
7788.4,"Now, this cannot be over-emphasized, right? "
7792.68,No matter how much we would like to create 
7796.06,"a top-down description, meaning from the cortex "
7799.91,and our understanding of things 
7801.86,"onto what we find attractive, who we find attractive, "
7804.68,"what we enjoy, what we don't enjoy in the pursuit "
7807.63,"in romantic interactions with others, "
7810.75,"there always seems to be, and indeed, there always is "
7814.17,a deeper layer in which our subconscious processing 
7818.12,drives us to find a particular person 
7820.85,"to be particularly attractive, "
7822.57,"or in which we have chemistry with somebody, "
7826.04,or in which we lack chemistry with somebody. 
7829.22,"And I would say that one of the more exciting, fascinating, "
7833.81,"and indeed mysterious aspects of desire, love and attachment "
7839.38,"are those subconscious processes, "
7841.39,"those things that we call chemistry, right? "
7844.08,"I mean, people will report, for instance, that somebody's "
7847.23,"smell is just absolutely positively intoxicating for them, "
7851.48,or that somebody's smell is absolutely repulsive to them 
7853.89,and they don't know why. 
7855.77,"That the taste of someone's breath, and I don't mean that "
7859.16,"in any kind of poetic sense, I literally mean the taste "
7862.51,of somebody's breath in some cases 
7865.0,can be very exciting to somebody. 
7867.34,"And believe it or not, we can taste each other's breath. "
7869.88,I talked about this in the chemical sensing episode 
7873.46,"some months back, but we actually have receptors for taste "
7877.65,"and smell that engage in coordinated action, "
7880.35,such that we can't really separate taste and smell 
7883.32,at some level. 
7884.153,And this is especially true when it comes to the formation 
7887.12,of romantic relationships and what we call chemistry. 
7890.07,Now is chemistry absolutely required 
7892.83,for forming stable attachments for love and for desire? 
7896.93,"No, of course, they're not. "
7898.373,"But in general, these are primitive mechanisms "
7902.86,"that exist in all animals, "
7904.46,"they exist in special forms in humans, "
7907.38,"but that they drive us toward behaviors that will, "
7912.17,"as the theory goes, lead to love and attachment. "
7915.61,"Not always, as Dr. Fisher pointed out that sex and sex drive "
7920.34,"is one way to explore potential love relationships, "
7923.24,"and to explore potential attachments, "
7925.84,"which, of course, are major investments "
7928.48,"that extend well beyond one night, or a week, or a vacation, "
7932.06,or even a year. 
7933.46,"When we talk about stable attachments, "
7935.37,"in general, that means long-term attachments in humans. "
7938.89,"Now, there is a biology to all of that chemistry stuff. "
7944.38,And the studies of oral contraception and men finding women 
7948.85,"more attractive at certain phases of their menstrual cycle, "
7952.52,and women finding men more attractive at certain phases 
7955.46,of the women's menstrual cycle point to the incredible power 
7959.62,of those deeper biological mechanisms. 
7963.09,"In the ""Huberman Lab Podcast,"" "
7964.67,I discuss both science and science-based tools. 
7967.63,And so I'd be remiss if I didn't actually cover 
7970.77,some of the tools that relate 
7972.34,to those deeper biological mechanisms. 
7975.16,"Now, the hormones, testosterone and estrogen "
7979.14,are almost always the first biological chemicals 
7982.68,"and hormones that are mentioned, and described, and explored "
7986.61,"when thinking about desire, and love and attachment, too, "
7991.72,for that matter since love and attachment stem from desire. 
7996.81,I did an entire episode about the biology of testosterone 
8000.38,and estrogen and ways to optimize testosterone and estrogen. 
8005.18,You can easily find that episode at hubermanlab.com. 
8008.53,"It's timestamped, there you can find all sorts "
8010.62,of information about how certain behaviors or absence 
8014.27,of behaviors drive up or down testosterone and estrogen. 
8017.71,I also dispel some myths about sexual behavior 
8021.16,and things like masturbation 
8022.6,"and how they relate to testosterone and estrogen, "
8025.72,as well as some myths about how those hormones change 
8028.52,across the lifespan. 
8029.61,"I also talk about the role of exercise, "
8032.61,"I talk about supplementation, and I also talk a little bit "
8035.61,"about hormone replacement therapy, "
8037.13,although that will be the topic for a future episode. 
8039.71,So if you're interested in the biology of testosterone 
8041.97,"and estrogen, two hormones that absolutely influence "
8045.22,"things like libido and desire, please check out that episode "
8048.97,as well as what I'm going to talk about in just a moment here. 
8052.26,"The simple stereotyped version of the hormones, "
8054.7,testosterone and estrogen are that testosterone drives 
8058.76,"libido or increases it aka sex drive, "
8061.99,and that estrogen somehow blunts it or is not involved 
8065.63,in libido and sex drive. 
8066.86,And that is simply not the case. 
8068.672,As I describe in that testosterone and estrogen 
8071.85,"optimization episode and as I'll tell you now, "
8075.06,"yes, testosterone and some of its other forms "
8078.85,like dihydrotestosterone are strongly related to libido 
8083.65,and sex drive and the pursuit and ability to mate. 
8086.61,"However, the hormone estrogen is also strongly associated "
8091.49,with libido and mating behavior. 
8093.67,So much so that for people that either chemically 
8097.81,"or for some other reason have very low estrogen, "
8100.98,libido can severely suffer. 
8102.97,So it's a coordinated dance of estrogen and testosterone 
8106.29,in both males and females that leads to libido or sex drive. 
8110.42,So I absolutely want to make clear that it's not a simple 
8116.06,"relationship between testosterone and sex drive, "
8118.56,or estrogen and sex drive. 
8119.61,Both are required at appropriate ratios. 
8123.29,"Now, with that said, there are things that can shift libido "
8130.44,in both men and women in the direction of more desire 
8135.39,"or more desire to mate, either to seek mates "
8138.63,or to mate with existing partners. 
8141.75,And there's a quite solid literature 
8144.35,around a few of those substances. 
8146.75,"Now, a common misconception is that because dopamine "
8149.6,is involved in motivation and drive that simply increasing 
8153.64,dopamine through any number of different mechanisms or tools 
8157.47,will increase libido and sex drive. 
8159.92,And that's simply not the case either. 
8164.08,It is true that some level of dopamine or increase 
8169.29,in dopamine is required for increases in libido. 
8174.24,"However, because of dopamine's relationship "
8176.67,"to the autonomic nervous system, "
8178.43,and because the autonomic nervous system 
8181.25,"is so intimately involved, no pun intended, "
8184.45,"in sexual activity in seeking an actual mating behavior, "
8188.81,"as I described earlier, it's actually the case that "
8191.78,"if people drive their dopamine system too high, "
8195.68,they will be in states of arousal that are high enough 
8200.67,"such that they seek and want sexual activity, "
8204.43,but they can't actually engage the parasympathetic arm 
8207.47,of the autonomic nervous system sufficient 
8208.94,to become physically aroused. 
8211.37,There's a whole description of this that awaits us 
8214.56,in a future episode. 
8215.58,But I'll summarize now by saying for people 
8218.74,that are taking substances just simply to increase dopamine 
8224.76,"in order to increase libido, "
8226.152,that can be a potentially hazardous route to follow. 
8229.82,Because depending on whether or not that dopamine level 
8233.89,is high enough that it puts them into a mode of seeking 
8238.72,"mates or mating, but they can't adjust their autonomic "
8243.11,"nervous system during actual mating behavior, "
8245.49,what essentially is I'm saying is it can place people 
8246.889,into a chronic pursuit but in inability to perform sexually. 
8251.01,And this is true for men and women. 
8253.28,"Okay, so I would just caution people against just thinking, "
8257.157,"""Oh, a lack of libido is simply a lack of dopamine."" "
8260.81,That is not the case. 
8261.96,"It could be from lower levels of dopamine, "
8264.85,but it could also be for other reasons. 
8267.73,"And so these systems, these signaling systems "
8269.877,and these neurochemicals are very intricate. 
8273.15,"And just simply ramping up dopamine has actually been found, "
8276.85,"for instance, in amphetamine and cocaine users, "
8280.1,"there's a phenomenon in which they become hyper aroused, "
8282.54,but can't perform sexually. 
8283.76,This is also true for people who take elevated levels 
8286.75,of other recreational drugs or who take antidepressants 
8291.08,"that increase the dopamine system too much, right? "
8294.25,"Dosage has to be worked out with your physician, "
8297.06,"with your psychiatrist, such that mood is enhanced "
8301.05,"and the various aspects of a healthy wellbeing, "
8304.77,"mind and body are enhanced, but not so much so that "
8307.19,that what we call the arousal arc is locked with the seesaw 
8311.45,in the sympathetic drive position 
8314.56,"such that sexual arousal can't occur, okay? "
8317.61,"So this is an important point to make, "
8319.93,because I think that a lot of people 
8321.87,are under the impression that 
8323.242,"if they just drive up testosterone, increase dopamine, "
8327.13,and generally get themselves into high states 
8329.28,of autonomic arousal that that's going to increase the libido. 
8331.92,But that's simply not the way the system works. 
8334.67,It's that seesaw and that seesawing back and forth 
8337.61,that is the arc of arousal that we talked about earlier. 
8341.32,"Now, there are substances, legal over-the-counter substances "
8346.51,that fall under the categorization of supplements 
8349.29,that do indeed increase libido and arousal. 
8353.17,And so I'm going to talk about some of those in the context 
8355.04,of peer-reviewed literature now. 
8357.66,"I want to be clear, however, "
8359.0,that these are by no means required. 
8361.63,Many people have healthy libidos or have libidos 
8364.33,that are healthy for their life and what they need and want. 
8369.41,"And as always in any discussion about supplementation, "
8372.55,you absolutely have to check with your physician. 
8374.39,I don't just say that to protect us. 
8375.67,I say that to protect you. 
8377.16,Your health and wellbeing is dependent on you doing certain 
8379.47,"things and not doing others, and everybody is different. "
8382.12,"Nonetheless, there are studies that point "
8384.13,to specific substances that are sold over the counter 
8387.47,that at least in the United States are legal 
8389.38,and that have been shown to be statistically significant 
8393.58,in increasing measures of libido. 
8396.21,"There are many such substances, but three that in particular "
8400.97,have good peer-reviewed research to support them 
8404.3,"are Maca, M-A-C-A, which is actually a root. "
8410.505,"Tongkat Ali, also sometimes called longjack, "
8413.21,"I didn't name them, forgive me, and Tribulus, or Tribulus, "
8417.65,it's sometimes called. 
8418.85,I'm going to talk about each of these in sequence. 
8421.47,"But on the whole, the studies on Maca are quite convincing "
8427.97,"that consumption of two to three grams per day of Maca, "
8433.44,"which generally is sold as a powder or a capsule, "
8438.27,"typically consumed early in the day, "
8440.05,"because it can be somewhat of a stimulant, "
8442.05,meaning it can increase alertness and you wouldn't want it 
8444.93,to interfere with sleep by taking it too late in the day. 
8448.69,But in studies that include both men and women of durations 
8452.62,anywhere from eight to 
12,weeks 
8455.35,"of athletes and non-athletes, "
8457.53,"and different variations of Maca, "
8460.59,"turns out there's black Maca, red Maca, yellow Maca. "
8463.64,There are a bunch of different forms of Maca. 
8466.11,But that they can increase subjective reports 
8470.08,"of sexual desire, independent of hormone systems. "
8475.21,"Meaning, it does not seem at least based on the existing "
8478.37,literature that Maca increases testosterone 
8481.03,"or changes estrogen, at least not on the time scales "
8483.41,"that these studies were done, "
8484.659,or with the measures that were performed in these studies. 
8487.81,"But that Maca, again, consumed in doses of anywhere "
8491.91,"from two to three grams per day, "
8494.27,has been shown to significantly increase libido. 
8497.55,"And in fact, those dosages of Maca have been shown to offset "
8503.66,so-called SSRI induced sexual dysfunction. 
8507.33,So there are various routes to sexual dysfunction. 
8511.1,The SSRIs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. 
8515.2,"They go by name brands like Prozac and Zoloft, "
8517.31,and there are many others now on generic forms and so forth. 
8520.7,"Those don't always, I should point out, "
8523.66,lead to sexual dysfunction. 
8524.95,There's a dose dependence. 
8526.91,Some people do quite well on SSRIs and don't have any issues 
8530.95,with sexual function. 
8531.783,Other people suffer quite a lot from sexual dysfunction 
8535.31,"while taking SSRIs, highly variable. "
8538.07,"You need to work with a physician, a qualified psychiatrist. "
8542.87,"But nonetheless, everything I've been saying about Maca "
8546.55,thus far has also been explored in the context of SSRI 
8551.08,induced sexual dysfunction. 
8552.04,The paper that I'm referring to here is 
8555.547,"""A Double‐Blind, Randomized, Pilot Dose‐Finding Study "
8557.87,"of Maca Root..."" "
8559.06,It goes by the name L. meyenii. 
8561.95,These always have fancy names. 
8562.987,"And the Latin names in biology are always more complicated, "
8565.82,but it's Maca root. 
8566.977,"""for the Management of SSRI‐Induced Sexual Dysfunction."" "
8569.92,"First author is Dording, D-O-R-D-I-N-G. "
8573.68,"This was a study done at Mass General, "
8576.09,which is one of the satellite locations around Harvard Med. 
8580.7,"It's associated with Harvard Med, "
8582.78,that found significant improvements in libido 
8586.98,when people were taking a pretty low dose. 
8588.92,"It was actually in this case, just "
1.5,"grams per day, "
8592.84,"up to a high dose, three grams per day of Maca. "
8597.15,And they were doing this 
8597.983,in 
20,remitted depressed outpatients. 
8600.6,"So these are people that had depression, "
8601.843,"their depression was successfully treated with SSRIs, "
8605.04,but they were suffering from some of these SSRI related 
8607.86,sexual effects and Maca seemed to offset 
8610.17,some of those effects significantly in this population. 
8613.72,The other studies exploring the lack of effect on serum 
8617.97,testosterone in adult healthy men was a 
12-week,"study, "
8622.77,"again, consuming anywhere from "
1.5,"to three milligrams, "
8626.69,"meaning one, excuse me, "
1500,milligrams 
8629.13,to 
3000,milligrams or placebo. 
8631.27,"So again, this is "
1.5,"up to three grams of Maca or placebo, "
8636.5,"and they rated sexual desire, depression, and other measures "
8642.5,such as testosterone in the blood. 
8644.65,"Again, no change in testosterone or estrogen "
8648.54,estradiol levels in men treated with Maca 
8651.06,and those treated with placebo. 
8652.58,"But nonetheless, there was a significant and positive effect "
8656.6,on libido with this dosage of 
1.5,
8659.44,to three grams per day of Maca. 
8660.877,And there are several other studies that also show this. 
8664.95,"Again, in people that taking SSRIs and people that are not "
8669.37,"taking SSRIs, in chronically over-trained athletes, "
8675.02,this was also found to be the case. 
8676.22,"So seems like across the board, "
8678.91,Maca is a fairly useful supplement 
8682.06,for those that are seeking to increase their libido. 
8684.69,"And there are fewer studies involving women, "
8687.47,but there are a few such studies that also point to the same 
8691.07,general positive effect on libido in women taking Maca 
8694.68,at equivalent doses to those I just described. 
8697.46,I think it's noteworthy that Maca supplementation 
8700.15,does not seem to adjust testosterone or estrogen levels 
8704.22,"to any significant degree, but it does change libido. "
8707.47,I think that points to the fact that there are multiple 
8710.35,"systems in the brain and body that influence libido, "
8713.06,not just testosterone and estrogen. 
8715.2,And indeed we know that to be the case. 
8716.5,"Things like PEA, which is a substance found in chocolate "
8721.08,"and is a substance that some people supplement, "
8723.72,"is known, for instance, to increase sexual desire, "
8727.13,but also the perception of sexual experiences 
8730.26,as more stimulating for instance. 
8732.7,"So there are a lot of pathways in the brain, in particular, "
8734.97,"in the hypothalamus, this ancient area of our brain, "
8738.68,"that harbors neurons and hormone secreting cells, "
8742.55,including neurons that can shape our perceptions 
8745.85,of even just our tactile experience 
8749.21,of others and their attractiveness. 
8751.82,"And indeed can shift levels of desire, independent "
8755.27,of changing levels of circulating hormones. 
8758.17,Another substance that has been shown to increase libido 
8761.17,across a range of human populations 
8764.12,is so-called Tongkat Ali. 
8766.83,I've talked a little bit about this before 
8769.11,"on the ""Huberman Lab Podcast"" in reference to testosterone. "
8773.42,And I've talked about it extensively as a guest 
8775.38,on other podcasts. 
8776.64,Tongkat Ali goes by a number of different names. 
8780.42,One of them is exceedingly difficult for me to pronounce. 
8782.69,"It's Eurycoma longifolia, also called longjack. "
8787.86,But Tongkat Ali is the typical name. 
8790.43,"This is an herb, there's a Malaysian version "
8792.8,and an Indonesian version. 
8794.92,My understanding is that the Indonesian variety 
8797.53,of Tongkat Ali is the one that is most potent 
8800.01,for its effects on libido. 
8803.91,"Previously, I've talked about Tongkat Ali "
8806.32,taken in 
400,milligram per day capsules 
8809.75,"as a means to increase the amount of free, "
8813.19,meaning unbound testosterone. 
8815.26,So testosterone has a both bound form and an unbound form. 
8818.97,"Very briefly, the bound form is bound to albumin "
8822.5,in the blood or to so-called sex hormone binding globulin. 
8826.47,"When it's bound, it can't be biologically active "
8830.65,at many cells. 
8831.99,It is important that some of it be bound in order 
8834.22,to get a time release and proper distribution 
8837.3,"of testosterone through the body, "
8838.45,but is the unbound free testosterone that can really 
8841.58,have its most potent effects. 
8843.51,And there's some evidence that Tongkat Ali can increase 
8847.38,the amount of unbound so-called free testosterone 
8850.67,"by lowering sex hormone binding globulin, "
8853.22,although it is almost certain that it has other routes 
8856.31,of mechanism as well. 
8858.6,"Nonetheless, there are some reports of Tongkat Ali "
8862.76,increasing libido. 
8865.11,"One particular article, last author, or I should say "
8869.02,"last name of first author, excuse me, Ismail, I-S-M-A-I-L. "
8873.52,This was published in Evidence-Based Complementary 
8877.71,"and Alternative Medicine, it's from "
2012.,
8880.21,Reports a significant increase in libido 
8883.85,and sexual function. 
8885.17,"There are other studies, not a lot of them, "
8887.95,"not as many robust, controlled, quality peer-reviewed "
8892.54,studies as there are from Maca. 
8894.17,"Nonetheless, a number of people, men and women that I know "
8897.55,do take Tongkat Ali and it seems to work well for them. 
8901.22,The question always comes up around 
8902.96,discussion of supplements. 
8903.92,Do you need to cycle these things? 
8905.46,The only way to determine that is really 
8907.23,"to do your blood work, monitor liver enzymes, "
8909.96,monitor hormone levels and so forth. 
8912.21,"So I simply can't say whether or not you need to, "
8915.16,or you don't need to cycle them. 
8916.355,Typically Tongkat Ali and Maca are not cycled 
8920.97,in any regular kind of way that I'm aware of. 
8923.64,"But again, you really need to check with your doctor "
8926.33,if you're going to initiate taking any of these things. 
8929.26,And you certainly should do your best to monitor 
8931.44,your blood work as well as subjective measures in evaluating 
8934.33,"whether or not they're working for you, "
8935.46,safe for you and so forth. 
8936.77,The third and final substance/supplement 
8939.32,that I want to touch on as it relates to libido 
8942.0,is called Tribulus Terrestris. 
8944.77,"So that's T-R-I-B-U-L-U-S, terrestris, T-E-R-R-E-S-T-R-I-S. "
8952.41,This is a commonly sold over-the-counter supplement 
8956.39,"for increasing testosterone, "
8959.02,for fitness purposes and so on. 
8962.62,Whether or not it actually does that 
8964.69,"to a meaningful degree, isn't clear. "
8967.71,But I'm aware of four peer-reviewed studies 
8972.1,that were focused on both males and females 
8976.76,ranging anywhere from 
18,years old 
8979.84,all the way up to 
65,plus. 
8982.13,They say 
65,plus. 
8983.25,I guess it could be 
"70,",it could be 
80.,
8985.09,I don't know. 
8985.923,But a fairly broad age range where people took anywhere 
8990.67,from 
750,milligrams per day divided into three equal doses. 
8997.43,So 
750,total per day divided into three equal doses 
9001.37,of Tribulus or placebo for 
120,days. 
9005.44,This particular study was focused on females. 
9008.75,And according to the female sexual function index 
9011.59,"questionnaire, no significant difference "
9013.98,"between any of the groups, however free and bio-available "
9018.54,testosterone increased in the group taking 
9019.82,"Tribulus Terrestris, total testosterone "
9023.27,did not reach statistical significance. 
9025.29,"So this is the inverse of what we see with Maca, "
9028.46,"where there do seem to be increases in testosterone, "
9031.16,which would predict that there would be increase in libido. 
9034.76,"In this case, this was postmenopausal women, "
9037.93,there was no increase in libido. 
9039.24,There was an increase in testosterone. 
9041.15,I mentioned it only because there might be instances 
9043.7,in which people want to increase their testosterone. 
9047.77,"It does seem that Tribulus, at least in that population "
9050.25,is capable of doing that. 
9051.86,"Now there's a separate study that was done, "
9054.47,a double-blind study lasting anywhere from one to six months 
9058.44,that had a clear and significant increase in libido. 
9062.35,Now this was taking six grams. 
9065.08,So that's 
"6,",
000,milligrams of Tribulus root for 
60,days. 
9069.35,And it did seem to increase various aspects 
9071.74,of sexual function. 
9073.95,And there was what appeared to be a substantial 
16.3%,
9078.6,"increase in testosterone, but in this particular study "
9081.8,because of the variability across individuals 
9084.67,that did not actually arrive at statistical significance. 
9087.62,"Now, there were a number of other studies that explored "
9090.738,"the role of Tribulus, in particular, in females. "
9094.67,And one of those studies was a study 
9097.66,"that was actually quite short, it was two to four weeks. "
9100.71,It involved 
67,subjects. 
9103.07,These were subjects that had experienced a loss of libido 
9106.53,"and took Tribulus divided into two equal doses, "
9110.07,compared that to placebo. 
9111.64,And they did see a significant improvement in these measures 
9116.13,of sexual desire and function 
9118.07,on this female sexual function index. 
9120.44,So there is some evidence that Tribulus can be effective 
9123.21,"in increasing testosterone in certain populations, "
9126.11,in increasing sexual desire and function 
9128.79,in certain populations in particular in females. 
9132.03,I think more studies are certainly needed. 
9133.95,"But these three substances/supplements, "
9137.91,"Maca, Tongkat Ali, in particular, Indonesian Tongkat Ali, "
9142.6,and Tribulus can indeed create significant 
9146.26,increases in sexual desire. 
9148.48,And in some cases by adjusting the testosterone 
9152.06,"and estrogen system, in some cases not by adjusting "
9155.04,the testosterone and estrogen system. 
9156.64,"Again, pointing to the complexity of neurochemicals "
9160.69,and features that adjust things like libido aka desire. 
9164.66,So we covered a lot of material today related 
9167.28,"to desire, love, and attachment. "
9169.13,And yet I acknowledge that it is not exhaustive 
9172.64,of the vast landscape that is the psychology and biology 
9176.8,"of desire, love and attachment. "
9179.14,"Nonetheless, I hope that you found the information "
9182.23,interesting and hopefully actionable in some cases 
9185.81,"toward the relationships of your past, of present "
9188.91,and potentially for the relationships of your future.

9248.51,During today's episode and on many previous episodes 
9250.82,"of the ""Huberman Lab Podcast,"" we discussed supplements. "
9254.05,While supplements aren't necessary or appropriate 
9256.27,"for everybody, many people derive tremendous benefit "
9259.08,"from them, for things like enhancing sleep, enhancing focus, "
9262.76,or as discussed today for enhancing libido and desire.
