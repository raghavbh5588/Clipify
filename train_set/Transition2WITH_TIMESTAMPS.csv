666.12,clear that same intervention was able to improve post-planned yell glucose control insulin and a whole bunch of other factors in addition to that so if you are the sort of type who's like wow I'm in an office all day maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal not the best approach but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up ,1
848.7,do this all the time in my house when you you know have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms Etc you can get out of 20 seconds I run to my garage which is over there I hop on the the airbike and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in love it yeah ,1
1063.32,exercise and in particular if you're following a very clean diet that is not a lot of processed foods which of course is a good thing chances are you're not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science-backed ratio of 1 000 milligrams that's one gram of sodium 200 milligrams ,1
1083.96,of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's lmnt.com huberman to get a free element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lmnt.com huberman to claim a free sample pack so tell me about endurance what is endurance how do I get more endurance ,1
1369.98,thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything that is if I'm ingesting less caloric energy than I burn then I'm going to lose weight and if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn I'll maintain weight and if I ingest more then I burn then I'll gain weight sure that is the ,1
1679.52,breathe in O2 breathe out CO2 they do the opposite well what happens is because carbohydrates are long chains of carbon and fats are as well generally when we think about fats by the way it's important to understand that structure a little bit so if we think about triglycerides it is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol so one two ,1
1699.26,three and horizontally running off of each one of those are fatty acid chains right so we form this structure that looks like an e right like the letter e three in the back and then three chains coming off of it each of those chains are called fatty acids and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon right or a number of carbons strung together ,1
1954.2,fat generally in adipose tissue we'll put a little bit in muscle cells as intramuscular triglycerides and then the protein will use as structure right to do different things we don't like to use protein as material or fuel it's better used as structure and what we have to do then is if all of a sudden we realize that storage is getting too much in our ,1
1974.0,body in other words we're gaining too much weight we have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body and that is metabolism right anytime we're trying to break a carbon bonds though we can get energy to make ATP that's going to release the carbon out of our tissue into the blood we have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon ,1
2487.72,spidey sense have to has to be going off in your brain where like there has to be something linking these things and what's linking it is simply carbon Exchange so put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling more than you and inhaling without passing out the other problem is if you were to ,1
2504.4,Simply do a breathing protocol while the rate of exhalation would go up after that you would correct and go in the opposite direction so that's the problem is your net carbon the output over the course today is not going to change unless you increase the demand for energy and that's how you get into that negative state ,1
2548.74,can offload more CO2 okay carbons per exhale are you a more efficient fat loss machine it's a wonderful thought and the answer would be no not something you worry about because if you were to Exhale more carbon than actually needed now we're in a state of inefficiency ,1
2752.26,cardiac output will only adjust for energetic changes all right energy requirements in the acute moment right how much do I need go which is going to be determined by ventilation right how much air am I bringing in and putting out that's going to determine cardiac output and that's going to determine where we're at if you were to do like a ,1
2769.44,sub maximal exercise test when you were unfit to when you're fit or when you're fit the way you're super fit at sub Max you're going to see the same thing cardiac output will be identical and you're like damn nothing happened what you're not realizing is your heart rate at that same workload is now lower ,1
3153.42,intensity exercise the second you stop you're right back down to resting ventilation no problem because you were able to match the need for energy with the offload of waste one to one during that exercise when you start creeping up the intensity you can't do that so you have to basically start stealing a little bit of fuel here so even though ,1
3399.599,um you should probably beat about that that's a kind of a good number to think um honestly but people will understand a little bit about metabolism to be dangerous but not enough we'll we'll throw out these terms like fat adapted and fat adapted is a real thing but is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes right it is this idea thinking like I ,1
3421.079,can get into a spot where I'm maximizing fat burning maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not the same thing at all right that's the confusion so if you enhance fat oxidation and exercise that does not enhance fat loss per se ,1
3844.5,that's it's your first sign of light on defense if you need glucose outside of that you're going to start pulling it from the blood but one of the things your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything blood pH blood glucose blood pressure and electrolyte concentrations like it really does not want to mess with those ,1
3859.859,things at all it will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standardized right you generally because you need all those things for your brain to work and your brain will stop working right if you lose blood pressure it won't go up there pH changes you can't run metabolism electrolytes change you can't think and glucose is a ,1
4319.82,you're still going to add fat if you burn a muscle glycogen and you're hypochloric you're going to lose fat right think about it this way you're in a negative calorie state where are those calories going to come from are you going to reduce your muscle glycogen storages permanently no no are you going to reduce your glycogen ,1
4377.179,that there is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen that has to happen the only way to engage in fat metabolism is aerobic and oxygen there's no anaerobic component to it there's a fundamental difference there so the your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible it is the primary ,1
4399.199,fuel source for a reason your fat is not meant to be flexible it is meant to be Unlimited that's the basic point so you want flexibility over here and an unlimited capacity over there now I'm safeguarded against any energetic need okay I need to run up a hill for safety cool carbohydrates are there I need to then run for 17 hours cool fat is there ,1
4929.719,to up regulate your ability to use fat as a fuel and so this is like there's a saturation point outside of that Spectrum most people just say hey like I want to feel great throughout the day to be able to do a bunch of different things how do you know a couple things there's a lot of biological markers you ,1
5465.28,something like that before we go to sleep around 10 10 30 or so yeah so it's not you know midnight uh bowls of pasta I've done that too but um but typically it's not so I think that um people will be very interested uh myself included in how meal timing relates to all of this but um yeah let's ,1
6251.58,lactate lactic acid this is that whole system right again I'm skipping some steps making a little bit of mistakes here intentionally folks just to make this assumed so what happens when you start running a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis you start seeing massive rises in lactate ,1
6805.02,inorganic phosphate and some other nasty byproducts but that's the thing you have to deal with I'd love for you to teach me how different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long I happen to be exercising for example if I do a very short bout of exercise yep typically that's correlated ,1
6827.94,with a higher intensity output I mean I suppose I could jog for one minute but here I'm thinking about sprinting for one minute or less which fuels are used is that mainly driven by fat stores by carbohydrate stores is it driven by dietary fat preferentially or carbohydrate that I've ingested if indeed I've ingested those ,1
7361.46,example the heart and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free you can bring in the oxygen attach it to that hydrogen make water and now you're right back to pyruvate you put two pyruvate back together and now you just make glucose so you can actually store it in the liver this is a process called gluconeogenesis through ,1
8022.78,liver glycogen you start then having to pull in energy from another place so like as those numbers go down you'll see an increased uptick of energy from fat as well as protein having said that it's not a tremendous fuel source it is only aerobic so it has to be oxidized those are the same thing when I say oxidized ,1
8041.98,you use oxygen to burn something to make a fuel um so it's not a significant contributor to energy in that regard and unless you're talking ultramarathons are longer and it is also not something that can enhance performance and so we don't really need to talk much more about it than that in terms of fat as a fuel ,1
8667.3,can just wipe fat off the list it will never be your limiting factor to any type of endurance performance you simply have way too much the only problem with fat is is just too slow I've got to mobilize it I've got to get in the blood move it that whole thing too slow so if I want to go faster I will never be able to fully utilize fat which is why we ,1
8940.899,they're not doing ketogenic diets for mental health reasons per se but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot of long endurance but low intensity long endurance these are the I walk to get my exercise types and they do indeed walk a lot and some of them manage to control their weight very readily and like that ,1
9028.979,which is speed times Force four strength and five hypertrophy today we're talking about the remaining adaptations on that list starting with muscular endurance followed by anaerobic capacity followed by maximal aerobic output and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise so if we could start with muscular ,1
9640.92,you can repeat that a number of times but because remember the volume is fairly low the load is very very low you can actually repeat these quite frequently so you won't get extremely sore from muscular endurance relative to traditional hypertrophy straining because the load is very very light so you can do these more frequently if you ,1
9659.76,would like more frequently such as you could do it three or four times a week easy if you would like you don't necessarily need to three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here um if you wanted to do more sets on a given day and do less days that would be fine so if you want to do two days a ,1
9829.319,push-ups to Max duration and then also do that same workout before they do their high intensity interval training some other point during the week and then maybe even do it uh again um on their so-called rest day just a real quick five minutes of sure and in doing so build more capillaries into the relevant muscle groups and build their ,1
10057.8,that you're going to do five times this is for world championship fights you get one minute break in between so imagine going like 30 on 30 off for five minutes getting a one minute break and doing that five times even though the individual ballots are 30 seconds long the entire thing lasts so long it is primarily aerobic ,1
10509.359,applications you're going to be breathing because the nose is restricted right there's only so much space and as we talked about earlier the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or CO2 exhalation if you're restricting that this is going to be problematic so in your actual competition please go to the ,1
10527.359,mouth if you need to right we practice a lot trying to stay nasal only for as long as possible but that's going to eventually happen when you're doing your high intensity intervals and you're really going as hard as you can you're going to have to go to your mouth unless you're an absolute Freakazoid and you can say in your nose but that's not ,1
10988.46,have a worse performance rather than an injury rate so there's just a wonderful invention uh because of that where other things the consequences like say if you're going to be doing a barbell or kettlebell activity the consequences of making a technical mistake you might actually get an acute injury right there so they're just a little bit ,1
11358.06,all out work that's pretty good so what that means for me is I would do three all out one minute sprints on one workout separated by a minute or two maybe more and I would do that two or three times per week just trying to hit that five or six ,1
12187.38,actually do something as simple as like maybe you're going to do Farmer's carries and you'll do that for say three minutes and you'll set those down and you'll go straight into a plank for a minute and you'll pick that up and you go straight into maybe body weight squats for two minutes then you go straight into another exercise and you ,1
12206.279,can sort of rotate things around maybe you can do even some like Shadow Boxing stuff or some jump rope you can do different gymnastics movements and body weight movements and you can run that thing through and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished and not feel like you're doing oh my gosh this mind-numbing type of training if it ,1
12423.42,you're going to get fatigued that system right over time you have contracted contracted open up if that system starts to get fatigued you start running into failure here so you need to practice that and this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills to just simply training in this fashion there's all kinds of exercise devices for your ,1
12439.2,lungs and when we say that that's what we're really talking about the musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue so that's the only other little component I wanted to throw in here if we're not talking about acid buffering which in this particular case is not a problem anymore ,1
13070.52,the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed and to do it with better form and to breathe better and to feel better before during and after for those folks maybe you could spell out a program that combines these different elements of endurance and does so in a way that informs how for instance the higher intensity short ,1
13494.54,endurance adaptations are and how to Foster those through specific protocols things that not only I can do tomorrow but that I will do tomorrow and where I hit my pain points I'll understand what's happening and the adaptation that I'm triggering when my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air through my mouth or I can calmly move along just through ,1
13514.16,nasal breathing I will now know what's happening in my body and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering I think you also highlight something that is vitally important and I've never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today which is that it really doesn't matter how one seeks out to achieve fat loss provided certain criteria are met ,1
