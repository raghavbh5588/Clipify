choose from in order to address and provide relief from any of the different types of headache before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general ,1
public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is thesis thesis makes custom nootropics and as many of you know I'm not a fan of the word nootropics because nootropics means smart drugs and as a neuroscientist I can tell you there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart thesis ,1
with momentous supplements to find the supplements we discuss on the huberman Lab podcast you can go to live momentous spelled ous live momentous.com huberman and I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding again that's livemomentis.com huberman let's talk about headaches and as we are soon going ,1
to learn there are different types of headaches and different types of headaches arise from changes in different types of tissues in the head area and indeed in the neck area as well now one of the key things to understand is that if you want relief from a headache you need to understand which tissue is mainly involved in creating ,1
again you don't want to think about the brain as just sitting right next to the skull it's close by but there are a bunch of other thin fibrous tissues many of which are very thin and fragile and others of which such as the dura that are very very strong because they're very fibrous almost like a uh if you've ever felt for instance the sale of a of ,1
a sailboat you might think oh it's just this big flapping sheet in the wind it is anything but a sheet in the Wind it is a very very strong and durable material now the proximity of the dura and the meninges to the brain and the fact that everything is wrapped very tightly together and the fact that there's a lot of vasculature so that ,1
you'd like to check that out you go to hubermanlab.com just put into our search function immune system and you can find that episode by the way all of our episodes are searchable by keyword hubermanlab.com and it'll take you to specific episodes and time stamps for the topics you're interested in so for sake of this discussion about headache ,1
Sensory neurons they communicate the same way that motor neurons do that is they fire what we call Action potentials which are just electrical signals they release neurotransmitters like any other neuron but they respond to certain events in the environment or the environment within the body ,1
neurons and motor neurons and turns out those approaches exist as well okay so at this point I promise you that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology lesson in terms of pain sensing and headaches as a more uh conceptual phenomenon instead what I'd like to do next is talk about the different types of headaches and I think this is ,1
something that's very important and not often discussed except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of headaches like migraine or cluster or tension headache but I think for most people out there who experience headache and again that is everybody at some point experiences headache rather than ,1
not tension type headaches are going to come on because of some chronic psychological stress usually combined with lack of sleep usually combined with lifestyle issues and of course without getting into a long discussion about it anytime you have lack of sleep you're going to have excessive stress anytime you have excessive stress you're going ,1
that 43 43 percent of females suffer from migraine that is recurring headaches that qualify as migraine headaches and that 17 percent of men suffer from migraine headaches on a recurring basis which is again the definition of a migraine headache or one of the key definitions so all we can say for sure is that many ,1
exist in the brain and around the brain and that are going to cause the pain you're going to activate those Sensory neurons those non-iceceptors that will then give us the experience of extreme headache and migraine so taking an aspirin or something like it for migraine in some cases the worst possible Choice again so knowing what ,1
kind of headache you are experiencing is going to be essential here the other thing that you'll sometimes hear is that drinking a cup of coffee or getting caffeine through tea is a great way to deal with headache why would that be well it turns out that coffee can cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation depending on when you ,1
tissue of the nose more often than not the most inflammation is occurring on the the branch that innervates the lip or the region close to the lip and that's why a cold sword develops there an immune response there signaling that there's inflammation due to the herpes virus which lives on that neuron for a very long time neurons don't turn over ,1
forehead and other parts of the head can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion or being quote unquote knocked out but sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion most traumatic brain injury and ,1
concussion and low-level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living that is lowered cognition disruption and mood sleep Etc is actually the consequence of things other than Sports so for instance bicycle accidents playground accidents construction accidents and this is often ,1
headaches so the first substance that I'd like to highlight that has been shown to significantly reduce the intensity and or frequency of headaches is creatine now creatine as many of you know is something that people supplement and take most often creatine is discussed in the context of muscle performance not just ,1
for people who weightlift but for people who do endurance exercise and it's often been said that 5 to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate depending on how much you weigh 5 to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate can increase creatine phosphate stores in muscles can bring more water into muscles can make you stronger get increased power output ,1
someone weighs half that much they would take 20 grams of creatine per day and they did that over a period of six months and we know that when you take creatine over and over day to day that there's a buildup of creatine stores both in the muscles and within the brain tissue now what they found as a consequence of this creatine ,1
Administration was really striking and I think quite exciting they found a very significant decrease in the frequency of headache in people that were supplementing with creatine as opposed to the controls now keep in mind that this is a pilot study but the effects are very dramatic they found a very statistically significant decrease ,1
number of people experiencing fatigue and acute fatigue and chronic fatigue again not chronic fatigue syndrome per se but chronic fatigue which was in this study defined as a general sense of bodily weakness and even mental weakness mental weakness is a little bit hard to quantify but they were very careful to distinguish between cognitive and mental ,1
await other studies exploring the role of this high dosage of creatine which is a relatively high dosage of creatine monohydrate for offsetting headache meanwhile I think there are a number of people out there suffering from headache who might consider using creatine monohydrate in an exploratory fashion and seeing ,1
didn't write the paper dietary alteration of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for headache reductions in adults with migraine and this was a randomized control trial randomized control trials involve having people be in one condition where they do one thing and then they get swapped randomly into ,1
another condition so they serve as their own internal control and that controls for all sorts of things like differences in sex differences in age differences in health background in any number of other variables as best as one can in this study they had people either ingest a diet that had increased Omega-3s so increased EPA and DHA or ,1
omega-3 fatty acids the fact that they are available over the counter in a supplement or by liquid or available in food for that matter leads many people to conclude that oh you know this is supplementation this is something that um you know it's going to have relatively weak or minor impact on ,1
things like headache or other health metrics but let's just say that the fact that it exists as a prescription drug and its highest potency form at least in my opinion points to the potency of omega-3 fatty acids in dealing with analgesic effects that is reducing pain and anti-inflammation as well as some of the known cardiovascular improvements ,1
fluorescent bulbs that are commonly used in household lighting and workplace lighting and other forms of artificial lighting it's also of course present in sunlight sunlight includes a huge range of wavelengths including long wavelength light of course you've seen that as the Reds and oranges in the sunset and so on those intrinsically photosensitive ,1
retinal ganglion cells in the eye respond best to bright green or blue light and they send connections to a bunch of different places in the brain including the so-called Central circadian clock superchiasmatic nucleus that sets your day night sleep wake rhythms this is why I encourage people to view sunlight in the morning to set ,1
experiencing photophobia in addition and I mentioned this at the beginning of the episode but many people find photophobia to be a entry point or a trigger to headache so what happens is they start to experience some Aura some onset of photophobia and then the photophobia itself leads to this feeling of malaise that then converts into headache and so ,1
while there are not a lot of clinical data on this just yet an emerging idea in the realm of headache treatment is the idea that if you can offset some of the early signs you can offset some of that photophobia and aura perhaps to the use of dim red lights or red lights as I've described a moment ago then you might be able to reduce the ,1
does is it it prevents a certain step in the release of so-called neurotransmitter in the little packets that they live in which are called vesicles little little spheres of neurotransmitter live at the end of neuron nerve Terminals and are released onto the muscle make the muscle contract botulinum neurotoxin Cleaves a ,1
oil also contained eucalyptus oil they had another group used just peppermint oil they had another group use just tiny traces of peppermint oil and smaller doses of eucalyptus oil and then they had a fourth group which was just using Placebo when I say using what they were doing is they were sponge applying the oil to the temples and forehead of ,1
side effects and that of course can also include the use of essential oils in conjunction with things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs or the use of red light to offset photophobia in conjunction with any number of different treatments either prescription or otherwise so I do want to make that clear and I especially want to make that ,1
clear as I transition to the next segment where I'm going to tell you about herbal treatments for migraine and this is based on what I consider a very comprehensive review of many randomized control studies indeed the title of the paper is herbal treatments for migraine a systematic review of randomized controlled studies and this was ,1
a vasoconstriction associated with drinking caffeine so if you have a headache that is associated with excessive vasodilation and pressure in the head indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction by preventing that adenosine pathway that would normally lead to vasoconstriction and you can get some relief from that ,1
headache however caffeine is also a vasodilator caffeine has the ability to impinge on the so-called no pathway the nitric oxide pathway which is a nerve to blood pathway that involves a few different enzymes that we won't get into right now but maybe in a future episode that causes dilation of the blood vessels and as a consequence drinking ,1
anti-inflammatory but they also can impinge on other Pathways in particular hormonal Pathways and in fact curcumin AKA turmeric can alter the synthesis of something called dihydrotestosterone dihydrotestosterone is involved in an enormous range of different bodily functions it's involved in libido it's involved in Men in beard growth and in ,1
Not only would you feel miserable maybe even pass out but lose vision and certain brain areas will actually die off in the absence of blood flow to those areas we know this more commonly as stroke so I don't want to strike fear in anybody about eating a you know a jalapeno or even a very spicy meal from time to time but if you're not somebody ,1
you might be experiencing can be very beneficial for understanding which sorts of treatments ought to be best and perhaps also best avoided in trying to alleviate those headaches or prevent them from happening at all we talked about tension headaches migraine headaches hormone-based headaches cluster headaches and traumatic brain ,1
injury related headaches we talked about different types of treatments ranging from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation some herbal and indeed some essential oil treatments as well as acupuncture all of which have been shown to have significant impact in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches and in many cases reductions in the ,1
things like improving sleep hormone support and focus huberman Lab podcast has partnered with momentous supplements because momentous supplements are of the very highest quality and they include single ingredient formulations this is very important as I pointed out in the episode about a rational approach to supplementation single ingredient ,1
formulations allow you to develop the most biologically effective and cost-effective approach to supplementation in addition momentous ships internationally which is important because I realize that many of you reside outside of the United States if you'd like to see the supplements described on this and other episodes of ,1
