Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr Casey Halpern Dr Halpern is the chief of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine his laboratory focuses on bulimia binge eating disorder and other forms of obsessive-compulsive behaviors normally when we hear about eating disorders or obsessive-compulsive ,0
disorders of other kinds the conversation quickly migrates to pharmacologic interventions and serotonin or dopamine or talk therapy interventions many of which can be effective The Halpern laboratory however takes an entirely different approach while they Embrace pharmacologic and behavioral and ,0
talk therapy interventions their main focus is the development and application of engineered devices to go directly into the brain and stimulate the neurons the nerve cells that generate compulsions that cause people to want to eat more even when their stomach is full in other words they do brain surgery of various kinds sometimes removing small ,0
bits of brain sometimes stimulating small bits of brain with electrical current and even stimulating the brain through the intact skull that is without having to drill down beneath the skull in order to alleviate and indeed sometimes cure these conditions today's discussion with Dr Halpern was an absolutely fascinating one for me ,0
because it represents the Leading Edge of what's happening in modification of brain circuits and the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease for instance they just recently published a paper in nature medicine one of the Premier journals out there entitled pilot study of responsive nucleus succumbings deep brain ,0
stimulation for loss of control eating the nucleus that Cummins is an area of our brains that we all have in fact we have two of them one on each side of the brain that is intimately involved in the release of dopamine for particular motivated behaviors and while most often we think about dopamine for the release of behaviors that we want to engage in ,0
um I as a part of our invasive trial uh where we are trying to pull patients from a TMS trial that's in parallel to what we're doing um all funded by the foundation for OCD research where we believe we can use TMs to to define a circuit that if modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily and in ,1
in this context they are using stimulation and control of neuronal activity in nucleus accumbens to control loss of control eating something that when people suffer from it despite knowing they shouldn't eat despite not even wanting to eat they find themselves eating so again this represents really the Leading Edge of where Neuroscience ,0
is going and certainly is going to be an area of Neuroscience that's going to expand in the years to come and Dr Halpern and the members of his laboratory are among a very small group of scientists in the world that are using the types approaches that I described a minute ago and that you're going to hear more about in today's ,0
episode in order to resolve some of the most difficult and debilitating human conditions during today discussion you will also learn about the use of deep brain stimulation and other approaches for the treatment of movement disorders such as essential tremor Parkinson's disease and various types of dystonias which are challenges in generating ,0
particular types of movement so whether or not you or somebody that you know suffers from an eating disorder from obsessive-compulsive disorder or from a movement disorder today's episode is sure to teach you not only about what's happening in those Arenas but also in the Arenas of Neuroscience generally in fact I would say today's episode is ,0
times a week um and in fact you know the patients that we're studying you know we've we've seen patients that lose control 20 30 times a week and that's probably the the term you have in mind when you're saying you're surprised that it's just one time a day and it's specifically related to the fact that these patients have to eat ,1
such a large amount of food in such a brief period of time um so it's hard to do that more than once a day I see um you mentioned that some pre-existing anxiety might bias somebody to have a binge I'm also fascinated by something I've observed before which was when I was in ,1
careful with their hands you're not going to see them doing heavy deadlifts you're not because of the way that impacts the motor neurons it's all about fine control yes um so if your neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts you might want to consider getting a different neurosurgery I hope I didn't put anyone out of work there and then ,1
the other the other thing is that um you all are tend to be very calm people at least on the exterior we'll return to this later okay um but I do throw three or four questions out at once so so elevated autonomic arousal and alertness as well as decrease autonomic arousal and ,1
another stigma then there's the opposite in a way it's an opposite by the way for a phenotype standpoint is that anorexia I mean that's another stigma and you know gosh you know not to make this about one sex over another but when when girls are told they're pretty because they're thin it just reinforces this problem and of ,1
are very vulnerable and I think that will really help changing Society is hard and most of society is not you know ill meaning uh it's all done by accident um but that is the society that we live in so if we can try to improve that stigma uh and and be kinder to people in that way I think a lot of these problems would get better people that are obese ,1
by the way none of this has been published uh but I think it's so important for people to know this so I I am willing to share some aspects of what we're trying to do um but uh but that's that's really the first goal of this trial is to identify where the nucleus accumbens we can detect these craving cells so we have to ,1
provoke food craving in the operating room that's the first thing how do you do that ah well um there are some uh somewhat validated ways to do that so for example we asked patients to provide pictures of food that they rate very highly as something that they would typically crave and you know depending on the patient it might be something ,1
vulnerability is preceded by what we call a a moment of sort of pre-meal negative effect which basically means right before they binge they're feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious and they compensate for that momentary symptom by binging or losing control over food not everybody needs criteria ,1
exactly um you know with 0.5 millimeters of air so super precise uh or as precise as we think we need to be um and we use connectomics so there's a tool in brain Imaging called tractography where we can actually measure circuit connections it's it's an indirect assay but we believe it's ,1
especially important for anyone that wants to understand how the brain works and what the future of brain modification really looks like for all of us before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to ,0
Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is Roca Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses they're of the absolute highest quality the company was founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford and everything ,0
about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses were created with performance in mind I've spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with a number of very important challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly for instance when you go from a sunny area to a more shaded area ,0
um I wouldn't want to hyperactive certainly not an impulsive neurosurgeon given that the margins of error are so so tiny the spatial scale and probably on the temporal scale too yes and you don't want people doing things in time that are or being spontaneous at all do you think that this branch of medicine that you're in selects for ,0
people that at least can know how to control any kind of fluctuations in autonomic growl so they can calm themselves in real time and here's a specific question when I've never operated on the human brain although I've had the privilege of being in the operating room and seeing this with some of our experiments with people in VR ,0
it's a remarkable thing I wish for everybody that would get this experience at some point not hopefully as a patient unless they have a need but to observe it but what was just striking to me is the various uh stereotype behaviors of the surgeon and when I did surgeries as a graduate student as a postdoc in the brains of other types of animals I would ,0
and then back out again it's a very complex process Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were built that is engineered with that sort of biology in mind and as a consequence no matter where you are wearing them and where you happen to be you always see through them with Crystal Clarity the aesthetic of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses is also worth mentioning ,0
unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there which only come in the kind of cyborg variety Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in those varieties but they also come in varieties that you would feel very comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work or to school really anywhere that you go if you'd like to try Roca ,0

about the close relationship between temperature and your ability to stay asleep and emerge from sleep the way Aid Sleep mattress covers work is that they allow you to program the temperature of your mattress so that you can fall asleep quickly get into deep sleep stay in deep sleep and emerge from that sleep feeling especially rested by dropping ,0
the temperature of that Surface by one to three degrees at the beginning of the night dropping it a little bit further into the night and then raising the temperature towards morning because waking up requires that one to three degree re- increase in body temperature I've been sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover for the last six months ,0
or so now and I can assert that it is the absolute biggest Game Changer in the quality and duration of my sleep in fact I don't really like traveling as much as I used to because the eight sleep doesn't go with me and they don't seem to have them yet in airbnbs and hotels so this is also a call to action airbnbs and hotels please put eight sleep ,0
mattresses on your beds and I'll be more apt to stay in those hotels and airbnbs with that said if you'd like to try an eight-sleep mattress cover you can go to eightsleep.com huberman check out the Pod 3 cover to save 150 at checkout again that's eightsleep.com huberman and please note that eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select ,0

getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be assessed with a quality blood test one of the major issues with the various blood tests out there is that you get information back about lipids and hormones and metabolic factors Etc but you don't know what to ,0
do with that information with inside tracker they make knowing what to do with the information you get about your biological health extremely easy they have this very easy to use dashboard and that dashboard tells you for instance what to change in your nutrition what supplements you may want or may not want to take as well as other behavioral and ,0
other types of interventions that can allow you to move those numbers related to metabolic hormone and other factors into the precise range that's optimal for your immediate and long-term Health if you'd like to try inside tracker you can go to inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside trackers plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman ,0
to get 20 off on many episodes of The huberman Lab podcast we talk about supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everyone buddy many people derive tremendous benefit from them things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels to ,0
Optimal range for you the huberman Lab podcast is now partnered with momentous supplements we partner with momentous for a number of important reasons first of all the quality of their ingredients is exceptional it's really Second To None second of all they ship internationally and that was important to us because a number of you reside ,0
outside of the United States third we've worked with momentous very closely to develop single ingredient formulations now this turns out to be very important because if you're going to take supplements you want to know what's working for you and what isn't and of course you want to optimize the cost efficiency and the ,0
biological efficiency of those supplements to find the supplements we discussed on the huberman Lab podcast you can go to live momentous spelled ous live momentous.com huberman and I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding again that's livemomentis.com huberman and now for my discussion with Dr Casey ,0
Halpern Casey I should say Dr Halpern listening welcome thank you great to be here yeah it's been a long time coming we were colleagues at Stanford and then recently you moved of course to University of Pennsylvania also an incredible institution we're sorry to lose you so it was better sweet for me too Stanford's loss is upenn's gain but ,0
um let's talk about your work uh past and present as I've told the listeners already you're a neurosurgeon which I consider the astronauts of Neuroscience because you're in somewhat Uncharted Territory or very Uncharted Territory and yet Precision is everything right the margins of error are very very small so ,0
for those that aren't familiar with the differences between neurosurgery neurology Psychiatry you just educate us a bit what does a neurosurgeon do and what does fact that you're a nurse surgeon do for your view of the brain how do you think about and conceptualize the brain yeah the scope of neurosurgery is quite ,0
broad uh when I was in medical school I I was drawn to neurosurgery because of a procedure known as deep brain stimulation when I was at Penn as a college student I actually watched my first deep brain stimulation surgery performed by Gordon boltuck who to date is one of my career mentors deep brain stimulation is a one surgery ,0
that neurosurgeons offer but it's actually sort of a very small minority of what neurosurgery does you know we take out brain tumors we clip aneurysms in the brain we take care of patients that have had traumatic brain injury concussion spine surgeries ninety percent of what ,0
have to place a a very thin wire that's insulated deep into a part of the brain that's involved in Parkinson's disease for example uh but that's actually not the therapy the therapy is delivering electrical stimulation through the tip of that wire or one of the tips as there actually are multiple contacts at the bottom of the ,0
wire they're very small uh but that's all done out of the operating room you know this stimulation wire is connected to a a battery pack or a pulse generator that's kind of like a pacemaker and so we deliver this therapy and I always tell patients it's a bit more like I have to implant a uh a tool ,0
to deliver you a medication but that medication is going to be in the form of electricity and it's going to be delivered into a very small region of the brain and it's that procedure that's inspired me to not just become a neurosurgeon but has really defined the focus of my research laboratory as well Maybe by way of antidote you could tell ,0
us one of the more outrageous or surprising or who knows um delightful and thrilling things about the brain that you've observed as a consequence of stimulating different brain areas you know in textbooks we always hear about uh the kind of dark stuff you know stimulate one brain area somebody goes into a rage stimulate another brain area ,0
a person starts laughing uncontrollably first of all um given that some of the information let's hope not much but some of the information in textbooks is incorrect is are those sorts of statements true can one observe those in the clinic and what are some of the more interesting uh and I don't necessarily mean entertaining ,0
but um surprising things that you've seen when you've poked around in the brain deliberately of course and uh what have you seen what have you heard I have to say I I am amazed by these effects uh every day yeah I'm very privileged to be able to interact with the human brain in this way it's always ,0
in them with the goal of trying to provide somebody with a meaningful therapy but when we deliver electrical stimulation you know the these electrodes while they might be sitting in a very small region of the brain there are regions within a few millimeters of where these electrodes are that if stimulated could ,0
cause a temporary very brief side effect a moment of laughter like you said or a moment of panic and of course we can just shut that electrode off but often these side effects could be therapeutic and actually that's how we have discovered ways to use deep brain stimulation not just for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease but ,0
for example patients with Parkinson's disease that have a psychiatric uh uh comorbidity like depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder a lot of these patients are highly compulsive and impulsive sometimes these problems actually melt away and we're trying to help their Tremor but the patients also tell us ,0
that their gambling issue has gotten better or their mood has improved and why is that well you know there's probably more than one reason you know you can help somebody's Mood by making their Tremor go away of course but we see laughter in the clinic sometimes and and why is that and that's because we're stimulating parts of the brain that are ,0
not just involved in these motor circuits but they're also involved in what we call a limbic circuit or part of the brain involved in emotion and if we learn how to modulate those areas therapeutically step by step we can actually develop these therapies for other indications like depression I would say the most impressive and ,0
consistent effect we have when we have a patient with Tremor who has been tremming for the past 20 years if we can deliver stimulation through that electrode in the clinic we have immediate relief of Tremor and that is the effect that inspired me to be a neurosurgeon when I was in college I've never really wanted to do anything else ,0
X accept help develop that type of therapeutic for another another kind of symptom I'm very interested in obesity and related Eating Disorders compulsive Behavior the urge to uh to to have something that might be delicious but dangerous or unhealthy or a drug or a compulsion like we see in OCD or pests of compulsive disorder uh interestingly ,0
like we see Tremor melt away when we deliver electricity to a certain part of the brain we can see these psychiatric more psychiatric problems they're not all psychiatric disorders but let's say disorders of the brain we can see symptoms of those disorders also improve and often immediately just like we do with Tremor so I see it all the time to ,0
to pick out one uh would be would be a challenge because for me this is my my everyday the speed of the relief that you described for Tremor is really um incredible just thinking about drug therapies and there too there are side effects but they're still a lot of mysteries as to for instance why ssris ,0
even work when they work and the timing is always a challenge timing dosage yes absolutely um I'd love to learn more from you about OCD I I have several reasons for asking this first of all I'm a somewhat obsessive person I tend to be very very narrowly focused although I confess it's not a step function it takes me some ,0
time to turn off the chatter but once I'm into a thought train or a mode of being uh and thinking and work it's very hard for me to exit that that mode it's like a deep Trench adaptive in some circumstances less adaptive than others as you know the other is that when I was a kid uh I had a little bit of a grunting tick I used ,0
to I had a this intense intense desire to clear my throat um to the point where my my dad said like you need to stop that he used to squeeze my hand every time I do it and I used to hide in the back seat of the car in the closet to do it because it provided so much relief and then it eventually passed yes I wasn't medicated ,0
they never did anything about it every once in a while now if I'm very fatigued if I've been working a lot I notice it starts to come back I'll do this like kind of grunting and so it's been sort of like a pet neurological symptom for me that reminds me that these these circuits exist in all of us and that sometimes they go haywire and sometimes ,0
they just have subtle um you know over excitation or something of that sort and then the third reason is that I get thousands of questions about OCD could you perhaps just tell us what is OCD sure um what are some brain areas involved what are the current range of treatments and what's the difference between someone ,0
who is obsessive and somebody who has real OCD so a brief disclosure as a neurosurgeon I do take care of patients with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder um but my perspective on OCD may be a little bit different than a psychiatrist who who lives and breathes OCD and sees patients every single day with OCD I'd ,0
probably take care of a three to five patients a year with deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorders so I don't see these patients as routinely but my laboratory is geared as a researcher I'm very focused on trying to improve outcomes of deep brain stimulation for for OCD so I do feel I have expertise and and a perspective to ,0
share but just a brief disclosure I I do feel that as a neurosurgeon I am obligated to better understand where the obsessions in the brain come from and how we can interrupt them to stop the compulsion that's associated with the obsession sort of the intrinsic most feature of OCD uh better than we're ,0
actually doing it for example if we were to offer a patient with Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery of course there's some risk to the procedure but the outcome is so consistent and positive that many patients are willing to take on that risk uh for obsessive compulsion compulsive disorder the ,0
surgery risk is about the same however the benefit is not quite as robust and so a lot of patients and they're referring psychiatrists are reluctant to refer these patients to us and it's completely understandable uh I've been leading an Endeavor with a number of collaborators around the country to try to ,0
better understand these circuits in the brain uh study them in humans both invasively and non-invasively that would be with an electrode-based surgery sort of like we do at epilepsy to understand where seizures come from we want to understand better where obsessions come from but we're also working with imaging experts and geneticists to understand ,0
OCD at a broader level as well uh I I consider OCD to be a a spectrum disorder in a way uh and I I apologize to those who who might feel that I'm using that term incorrectly I'm using it in a way to describe patients that have obsessions and even some related compulsions might not meet criteria for OCD it may be something ,0
Andrew that that you have and as a neurosurgeon I'm really obsessive about safety and compulsive about my surgical procedures so you know I I think that some aspect of OCD which we often joke about but we should you know consider seriously because people do suffer from this uh some aspect of it helps us there are you know famous uh CEOs that ,0
probably have some level of OCD uh surgeons and scientists alike so perhaps if it can be controlled it's an asset and uh but if it goes awry and is uncontrollable then it becomes obsessive-compulsive disorder and I tend to see the patients that are the most severe so they have failed medication and there are multiple medications that ,0
are worth trying for OCD some can actually be very helpful which neurotransmitter systems do they tend to poke at well ssris are sort of the the first line for OCD but also tricyclics can be helpful so this is still the serotonin system but as we know the serotonin system interacts with the you know neurogenergic system and the ,0
dopamine system so it's hard to be specific to one of these things and I think that's also why it's hard for us to predict how these medications are going to to work for these kinds of patients but tricyclics and ssris can be very helpful and are definitely first line and there's others exposure response prevention is uh probably the ,0
most effective option which is kind of like cognitive behavioral therapy but these are different and offered by psychologists and this is a whole field and there's a a field or I should say a whole clinic at my institution focused it was started by Edna foa at Penn who this is what they do for these patients ,0
uh is offer these types of cognitive therapies exposure to the stressor and to try to get patients to habituate to whatever it is that stresses them and causes these uh compulsions to help these patients live in every day and function these are all fabulously helpful therapies for a variety of patients but there's still about 30 of ,0
patients that still suffer from OCD and some of them have severe OCD sometimes it's moderate to severe and those are the patients that I'm really motivated to try to help um our therapies for those patients right now I would say are are worth pursuing but not optimal um and so it's it's one of those things ,0
that we have to balance as a researcher because when you see patients like this you want to do everything you can to help them and I think it's important to educate patients on the risks and benefits of them this is deep brain stimulation surgery but also capsulotomy which is more of an ablation approach a little bit like deep brain stimulation ,0
but rather than delivering stimulation through an electrode you can actually heat the tissue and even destroy it some would say this part of the brain is very safe to destroy it's kind of like an appendix um others would say it's safer to modulate I have seen patients do very well with these ablations and so you ,0
know you asked me earlier what what I find so amazing about the brain these effects that we can have sometimes the lack of effect is what's so amazing you can actually Traverse parts of the brain without having any adverse effects on patients function at least that you can test but you can also destroy small parts of the ,0
brain we're talking three or four millimeters in size these little ablations can be really helpful for patients but have no obvious side effects that we can tell perhaps after a short recovery from surgery but nonetheless despite how safe they might be these surgical procedures still are surgical procedures and patients are ,0
hesitant to perceived especially when they know that their chance of a transformative effect is quite low we can generally achieve a responder rate of about 50 percent and responders still have symptomatic OCD so I'm really uh sort of inspired to really find a way to deliver these therapies in a more disease ,0
specific or symptom-specific way but we're years away probably from from that therapy since it's all part of a research study at the moment what brain areas should I think about when I think about OCD years ago I remember opening a textbook I think it was an undergraduate still and work from Judith Rappaport at the National ,0
Institutes of mental health this would be late 80s early 90s was um had done some neuroimaging or maybe it was pet or some other Imaging technique and had identified portions of the basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures in OCD and maybe some differences in boys versus girls so what brain areas are ,0
there sex differences in terms of OCD and were one to come into your clinic this you know for this sort of a work of ablations or stimulation uh where would you first start to probe in the brain yeah you this is a uh a disorder of both cortex and the Sub sub cortex uh ,0
the cortical control areas areas that are involved in inhibitory control we have found to not function properly in patients with OCD so areas like the orbital frontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex if you image these areas or study them even in a a rodent model of OCD which quite honestly these models they model aspects of OCD but OCD ,0
is a human condition you can't really model this whole condition in a in a mouse or a wrap but perhaps you can model compulsive behavior in a rat sure and pulling out their hair yeah exactly you know that's that's not necessarily obsessive compulsive disorder but that is compulsive behavior and perhaps if you can ameliorate that in a rat that ,0
might be helpful for a patient with OCD but we have to approach animal modeling of OCD thoughtfully uh and and most scientists do I think uh when we study OCD in in models or in in humans with imaging and and we're trying to do it invasively with with electrodes like we do in epilepsy patients we find that areas in the cortex like ,0
the prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex are are not functioning they will the way they would in a non-oc patient they are often hyper functioning uh such that while you might say Well they're hyper functioning so aren't these patients you know functioning better that hyper focused yeah hyper focused exactly ,0
um no I I would say it's it's not so much an up or down it's more that they're just dysfunctional and we need to find a way to try to restore normal function to these areas it's not so much directional really um we tend to oversimplify brain function by thinking about it with directionality too much ,0
um unfortunately Imaging studies sometimes demonstrate activation or hypoactivation and that's where I think these kinds of things can be misconstrued but what I would call the cortical areas of OCD is that they're dysregulated and we need to find a way to try to normalize their function so uh the frontal lobe is is huge but areas of ,0
the frontal lobe that are a bit more basal like the ofc or orbital frontal cortex and the prefrontal cortex definitely consistently seem to be implicated in patients with OCD and then their projections to the subcortex this is the basal ganglia like you were saying caudi putamen or the dorsal striatum and these are interconnected ,0
with the ventral striatum this is an area of the brain that I uh focus a lot of my energy in um this is the ventralstratum which is not limited to but includes the nucleus accumbens this is an area of the brain that we know to be involved in gating reward seeking behavior when it's perturbed it seems to gait compulsive Behavior meaning a rat ,0
will pursue a reward despite punishment despite a foot shock for example and that can be uh similar to an OCD patient they will um check their home for safety until 3 A.M in the morning and not sleep that night in a way that is similar to a rat seeking out a food reward uh despite a foot shock ,0
um doing something because of the urge but despite the risk and perhaps there is some normal judgment there we all have to take risks to function in everyday Society to be successful we have to take a risk to take care of patients with surgery there's some risk there we make a judgment call and that's not a condition ,0
that that's just normal but when our judgment is consistently sort of puts us at risk that's where we have something like OCD but OCD is also you know it's one of many conditions that suffer from these kinds of problems we tend to label them because they tend to present in a consistent way so we have patients with OCD that have hyper checking Behavior or ,0
contamination Behavior where they if they feel contaminated they'll wash their hands for hours repeatedly or if they drop their toothbrush on the floor this will lead to a compulsive behavior of cleaning a toothbrush or brushing your teeth consistently very very common symptoms that we see or signs that the patients report to us or or that we ,0
observe but you know patients with eating disorders they tend to if if they have binging disorder they'll overeat if they have bulimia they might Purge despite the risk of these things and so um addiction is is similar we we tend to drug seek if we're addicted um uh we'll we'll pay off a dealer uh in ,0
order to get our fix and despite the risk and and that type of urge despite the risk is something that I I've always been really interested in and it's a common denominator to all of these problems and if you think about these problems I mean these are some of the most common conditions in our society today I'd like to take a quick break and ,0
acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still ,0
take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be in the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with the brain the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health ,0
and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll ,0
give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again that's athleticgreens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 I really appreciate that you're building ,0
this bridge from OCD to nucleus accumbens which is of course associated with reward in various forms and we'll get to that um I'll share a personal anecdote as a as a form of question when I was in college and studying a lot I relied on caffeine as a stimulant I've never really been into drugs or alcohol I've ,0
been Lucky in that sense I don't drink and I care less if alcohol disappeared never really liked recreational drugs so I was never drawn to them however when I was in college at the time there were these little epinephrine pills that were common in a lot of sports supplements these are like pre-workout type things yes not unlike ,0
energy drinks now which I completely avoid um and I had this experience of taking one of these and drinking some coffee and of course it gave me a lift in energy these are very similar to amphetamine they were legal over the counter at the time they're now either banned or illegal I do not recommend ,0
them and I had a lot of energy but what I noticed is that my grunting tick came back and I had I made one mistake I still think of this as one mistake which was um I engage in a superstitious Behavior I knocked on wood and then somehow it felt very rewarding like it gave me some totally irrational but internally ,0
rational sense of of security around I forget what I was knocking on wood about and I found that I couldn't break that knock on wood compulsion I felt I needed to knock on wood and so then I started sneaking knock on Woods like in mid-exam and studying and pretty soon I was knocking on wood often I developed a superstition ,0
and so I'm curious about the role of superstition and compulsion in the crossover there it makes sense logically to me but I was equally shocked to learn that when I stopped taking this stimulant which I was quite happy to to stop because it did make me feel too alert couldn't sleep well Etc that the Superstition went away as well ,0
and I'm guessing this has something to do with some of the reward circuitry as it's called related to stimulants again I am not encouraging anyone to take stimulants although healthy use of caffeine or safe use of caffeine might be the one universally accepted stimulant ,0
um it was really surprising to me how quickly this came on how quickly it engaged my my thinking and my behavior the obsessions and the compulsions and how quickly it turned off when I stopped taking this Sports stimulant or whatever it was I don't even remember I think it was some form of epinephrine ephedrine sure some saw epinephrine excuse me I ,0
misspoke ephedrine um is what I described sound totally outside the bounds of of uh logic or or am I imagining at all um no it did happen I'm certain it happened yeah no I don't think you're imagining it at all I you know this the grunting that you you mentioned to me you know first of all I ,0
didn't uh comment but you know that that sort of not to put a label on it but it sounds like a tick and you know ticks in in young males extremely common and they do tend to go away linking to like since I have a good friend who actually a famous neuroscientist I won't mention who it is who's worked very hard to suppress his his blinking tits and when ,0
he gets fatigued it comes back and and um he's very high functioning yes in his personal life and his professional life but but when you're talking to him and he starts doing this so you kind of start wondering like what's going on yeah yeah and it's unfortunate you know people with these problems especially as they get more severe then you get ,0
Tourette Syndrome you know it's hard to function in our society I have some friends that have Tourette I'll tell you I I'm just so inspired because there there so um they're so confident and you know people obviously notice these problems but they they just live their life and they're very successful and that's not ,0
typical um I have I have friends that I went to Penn with undergrad that had these kinds of problems and I was always just so happy and inspired by them but what's more typical is uh you know these problems cause people to lose their confidence and and not you know uh pursue you know their profession ,0
as they may have done or um things of that nature so I I think it's all related to the fact that we our brains are very vulnerable and to get back to your question about the stimulant you know I think I think your brain was very vulnerable to it you know you you sort of may have had a predisposition to it ,0
um you mentioned that you have you're a little obsessive and with the tick there maybe you have this kind of you know on the on the mild side of the spectrum OCD um and I I probably do as well by the way so I also also have avoided drugs for that reason uh in my life I'll drink a little bit of wine here and there but that's about it ,0
um and uh but I I think most people don't avoid these things and we see these problems in relation to not just taking a stimulant but any kind of environmental exposure our own Society causes so much stress um and that's why I think we have these human conditions these are human conditions we try to model them in in ,0
animals but most animals don't have these kinds of problems you know I've heard that you can a an animal like a a monkey in the wild can have depression a monkey's version of depression but I don't think it's really typical or human depression you know and certainly it's not as prevalent as depression is in our human society I think you know we ,0
haven't evolved to manage the stresses that are in this society that we currently have and stimulants is probably one of them you know and I I suspect you are probably a little bit vulnerable um it's possible the stimulant led to an overdrive of your prefrontal and orbital frontal cortex and even brought out a ,0
their Tremor go away of course but we see laughter in the clinic sometimes and and why is that and that's because we're stimulating parts of the brain that are not just involved in these motor circuits but they're also involved in what we call a limbic circuit or part of the brain involved in emotion and if we learn how to modulate those areas ,1
used to hide in the back seat of the car in the closet to do it because it provided so much relief and then it eventually passed yes I wasn't medicated they never did anything about it every once in a while now if I'm very fatigued if I've been working a lot I notice it starts to come back I'll do this like kind of grunting and so it's been sort ,1
completely understandable uh I've been leading an Endeavor with a number of collaborators around the country to try to better understand these circuits in the brain uh study them in humans both invasively and non-invasively that would be with an electrode-based surgery sort of like we do at epilepsy to understand ,1
where seizures come from we want to understand better where obsessions come from but we're also working with imaging experts and geneticists to understand OCD at a broader level as well uh I I consider OCD to be a a spectrum disorder in a way uh and I I apologize to those who who might feel that I'm using that term incorrectly I'm using it ,1
patients but tricyclics and ssris can be very helpful and are definitely first line and there's others exposure response prevention is uh probably the most effective option which is kind of like cognitive behavioral therapy but these are different and offered by psychologists and this is a whole field and there's a a field or I should say a ,1
identified portions of the basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures in OCD and maybe some differences in boys versus girls so what brain areas are there sex differences in terms of OCD and were one to come into your clinic this you know for this sort of a work of ablations or stimulation uh where would you first ,1
problems and if you think about these problems I mean these are some of the most common conditions in our society today I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking ,1
athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be in the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with ,1
little OCD Behavior related to this super uh this Superstition that you had so um no I believe that entirely and I also think you know that's why things like OCD and other kinds of psychiatric disorders tend to present themselves in college when people leave their home and they're in school and they're stressed and they're getting exposed to things ,0
that they haven't been exposed to before outside of the home and and you know their brains aren't evolved and sophisticated enough yet to help them cope with these kinds of stresses and how it manifests is in these kinds of conditions and it's I don't want to put a label on those conditions but certainly could be a psychiatric ,0
disorder but could also just be lots of anxiety it could also be the kind of problems that you had as well so um and I think the nucleus accumbens and the cortical areas that we've been discussing that that sort of send projections to these areas are are probably at least one of the main circuits involved in these kinds of ,0
things I'm relieved it's no longer present but I confess it oh I always feel it close by a long run helps so move you know being a slightly fatigued not overly fatigued but slightly fatigued seems to move out the the kind of physical compulsion but try to channel it um never taken any medication for it then ,0
here I am so I'm still still going I may call you for a referral at some point but sure at this point I'm uh I'm feeling okay um let's talk about nucleus accumbens and reward circuitry and the relationship between OCD reward addiction uh and to just give you a sense of where I'm headed with this is ,0
into the realm of a food related and eating related uh behaviors and disorders because I know you're doing some very important work there what is nucleus accumbens I know we all have one or two um one on each side of the brain what is it what roles does it play um in healthy brain behavior and in ,0
pathology yeah the nucleus accumbens is a part of the brain part of our reward circuits The Hub of the reward circuits that I've always been most fascinated in um there are scientists around the world some of the leading arguably some of the leading scientists in the world the ,0
father of addiction Neuroscience I call him um although he tells me I'm nuts Rob malenka who has studied the nucleus accumbens since the beginning of his career and who I worked with when I was at Stanford um fabulous scientist and Mentor taught me so much ,0
um taught the world so much incredible person scientist and phys and Physicians yes MD PhD and uh brilliant in both ways and um very fatherly in a lot of way in terms of teaching people how to how to do science and and be good citizens as well um but uh ,0
the nucleus accumbens is an area that is also very complicated because it has a lot of functions uh it it interconnects with many parts of the brain um but there are some things about the nucleus accumbens that are very consistent uh ,0
so when I started getting interested in reward and what a what I could do as a surgeon to try to improve how we manage Rewards and what I mean by that specifically is if you have an urge for a reward that that's a normal phenomenon that's not something we're trying to stop the issue is if you have an urge for a ,0
reward that either puts you or somebody else at risk it's probably a reward we shouldn't have I suppose you could say well it depends on the size of the reward and the size of the risk and how that fits into your societal Norms um but for example if you're obese and you have a doctor who is advising that you lose weight and try to control your ,0
eating habits uh you know perhaps better food choices is an important way for you to be healthier and and not pursuing those better food choices that's an urge that we probably need to treat uh if you're a drug addict and you use heroin or opiate considering the opiate crisis right now or cocaine which is untreatable at the moment uh ,0
you know that that cocaine might make you feel like you have some more energy that day to deal with your work or that opiate might make you feel better because life is stressful but the risk of doing those things is really high in fact potentially lethal uh so that's an urge that's treatable if you have OCD and you ,0
can't sleep at night because you're so nervous that you didn't lock the door and you've checked 30 times that's a reality for some people with severe OCD um that's an urge we got to treat eating disorder is the same eating eating disorders and obesity are obviously linked because of the ,0
relationship of a patient with food but they're also quite distinct not everybody with obesity has an eating disorder and obviously not everybody with an eating disorder has obesity I'm particularly interested in patients that have binge eating disorder as well as obesity because they're so heavily linked ,0
but not everybody with binging disorder has obesity but on average most are overweight um we are doing a deep brain stimulation trial at Penn where we're trying to modulate the nucleus accumbens and understand it better in patients that have failed gastric bypass surgery the most aggressive form of treatment for ,0
obesity and we and we believe they failed gastric bypass surgery because of binge eating disorder meaning they just can't control how much they eat so their obesity is either related or even due to overeating not some predisposition to um that body habitus you know obesity is a phenotype something that we can see not everybody is obese because of the ,0
same thing so it's very important I was taught this by a close mentor and friend Tom wadden when he was the director of the Obesity Center at Penn or the center for weight eating disorders and and he said to me you know Casey uh you know be careful with obesity you're interested in addiction and I understand you're interested in the addictive ,0
Tendencies of certain patients with obesity uh uh and and their relationship with food but not everybody with obesity has that problem and and in fact it's it's probably present about 20 of patients with obesity but now taking a step back twenty percent of patients with obesity is ,0
still a massive problem of epidemic proportions and perhaps some of these patients have either some form of binging disorder or or I should say some degree of bingeing disorder uh or at least loss of control eating which is common to both um so that's a feature that I think eating disorder experts obesity experts ,0
neurosurgeons obesity obesity medicine experts would agree is common to eating disorders and obesity and I also believe would is common to addicts and perhaps patients with OCD is sort of a loss of control disorder um it's actually not a disorder known by like the DSM-5 some diagnostic manual ,0
but a feature I should say of these conditions that's common and that common denominator I believe can be restored or at least this problem can be ameliorated or improved upon by a better understanding and a tailored treatment to the nucleus accumbens specifically we've learned in mice that if you expose a mouse now this is just a model if you ,0
expose a mouse to high fat food not food that they would normally eat food that is like 60 fat high fat it's like butter um we've learned that if you expose them to food like that within two weeks their nucleus accumbens is not functioning like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food there's aspects of it ,0
that are hyperactive I could say and there's aspects of it that are hypoactive or decreased activity but either way it's it's not functioning properly and most likely that function is predisposing continued behavior and then probably eventually leads to things like a habit that gets developed and that's a whole nother area of these ,0
kinds of problems that is very complicated and poorly understood but in any case if we just focus on the behavior at hand it seems that repeated exposure to something like high fat food a drug of abuse or any type of reward that is a really strong reward in a way it can hijack normal functioning of the ,0
nucleus accumbens so the goal of our invasive trial is to try to restore normal functioning to that nucleus accumbens uh in mice there seems to be a signal that predicts when they're going to lose control and we can use that signal to deliver a sort of a real-time therapy in the form of deep brain stimulation just a brief amount of ,0
stimulation and that actually blocks the behavior and what's interesting is over time that signal actually decreases in frequency which suggests some level of restoring normal function to that circuit in the mouse and we're trying to do that now in a human trial fascinating where is the stimulation ,0
provided because I would imagine if one were to stimulate nucleus accumbens you would see a reinforcement of whatever Behavior coincided or preceded the stimulation so the stimulation it's a a brief delivery of stimulation anywhere between 5 and 10 seconds that is intended to just disrupt the ,0
perturbed signaling that's happening in the nucleus accumbens there are disorders like depression let's say that I I would describe as a bit more of a state disorder and this is obviously oversimplified because we know that there's fluctuations in mood and depression as well so don't let me ,0
oversimplify it too much um but um but but for now let's forgive the oversimplification if we if we accept that depression is a state disorder or maybe Parkinson's disease is a state disorder recognizing that they do fluctuate uh these types of problems most likely ,0
not but not definitely most likely need a continuous therapy of some form a therapy that's consistent uh perhaps a therapy that fluctuates with the condition but nevertheless still consistent um binge eating disorder or OCD or addiction ,0
um and binging disorder in the context of obesity a lot of these patients are functioning quite normally every single day it's just that intermittently throughout the day there's brief interruptions in their normal functions such that they have thoughts about food or the drug of abuse that they're really longing to have ,0
and so we want to deliver a episodic therapy delivered at the right time and only at the right time to try to interrupt the circuit aberration or the the problem at hand that is going to lead to that dangerous behavior and to kind of get the patient back on track to what ,0
they're doing um I don't necessarily think that it leads to a reinforcement it's possible we have to study that more but rather the goal is to just disrupt perhaps what is kind of Habitual um or or at least this kind of recurring problem that is happening you know ,0
people that have bingeing disorder at least at a severe level they tend to  about once a day but they don't binge all day long of course they have a moment perhaps when they get home from work and they're stressed where they might have a bout of binge what constitutes a binge and I also want to know does binge ,0
eating disorder come on suddenly meaning as an entire disorder one day people wake up Suddenly they have binging disorder or is this you know a few too many buffets and I'm being entirely serious here you know kind of unlimited food and a circuit gets flipped or kind of starts moving into the high RPMs so to speak ,0
um so how does it come on and um I mean I'm actually surprised to hear that it's once a day I would think just hearing binging disorder I assume it's like OCD which it probably fluctuates across the day as well but I would have thought anytime people around food they just simply can't control their intake of food yes so so what does this look like ,0
in terms of the onset of the disorder and then what do you think underlies this once a day type of phenomena that's pretty interesting yeah so severe binging disorder these patients will binge about once a day it could be a couple times a day but in general it's not more than that moderate is about three to four times a week for example ,0
the reason I think that that seems surprising to you and if you think about it it is surprising but but um and I agree with you but the reason for that is is actually just in the definitions of the word and as a neurosurgeon in full disclosure ,0
as I as I mentioned you know I don't see these patients clinically I see them for research trial purposes and I try to understand the literature around eating disorders and I obviously collaborate with fabulous Eating Disorders uh uh in in these problems that are that are highly Innovative people uh but the word binge is a definition ,0
there's a definition to that word and you can't necessarily binge all day because our stomachs are not big enough um and so uh there's a limit to how much one can eat and to meet criteria for a binge you have to have a sense of loss of control you have to eat an enormous amount of food in a brief period of time ,0
and yes generally that doesn't happen more than about once a day in a patient with severe binge eating disorder uh however they can lose control quite often and in fact perhaps even at every meal they might meet criteria for about a loss of control where they yes they may have lost control but they might not have eaten enough ,0
to constitute what we would Define as a binge um and that would be a there's no specific number to that by the way it's it's really just compared to their normal meal you know perhaps it's uh 50 of their daily calories in that one brief moment um so uh that's that's why I think it ,0
seems surprising that binders aren't happening more often than that what I would say is if we replace the term binge with loss of control eating loss of control eating Could Happen dozens of times a week um and in fact you know the patients that we're studying you know we've we've seen patients that lose control 20 30 ,0
times a week and that's probably the the term you have in mind when you're saying you're surprised that it's just one time a day and it's specifically related to the fact that these patients have to eat such a large amount of food in such a brief period of time um so it's hard to do that more than once a day I see ,0
um you mentioned that some pre-existing anxiety might bias somebody to have a binge I'm also fascinated by something I've observed before which was when I was in college my my girlfriend had a roommate who we were aware was bulimic and would binge and then Purge and often uh when she ingested alcohol that would lead to ,0
a binge sure which is kind of the opposite of anxiety when I think about alcohol as something that slightly reduces prefrontal activity somewhat of a sedative or certainly a set of higher dosages so this brings to something that you said I'm just gonna I won't say it as eloquently as you did that it seems like ,0
it's not neither the case that anxiety leads to binging nor that hypo reduced activation of the forebrain and lower anxiety leads to binging it's this dysregulation of circuitry that the the Seesaw could go either way and it can throw things off it's off balance in both cases yes uh it's uh and that seems to be a that seems to pose a problem it ,0
seems like it's a particularly tricky problem and kind of explains to me in my non-clinical awareness why medication might be really hard to use as a way to treat this but that being able to poke around in the brain and assay in real time you know how do you feel do you feel like binging now or do you feel um further from the binge impulse ,0
is that what you do with these patients are they awake while you're stimulating the brain because it's one thing to say I stimulate a brain area and the binging goes away or partial relief or complete relief but how do you know are they in there with a donut um and you're tempting them so how do you actually know if it's ablating a ,0
brain area is going to lead to uh relief or exacerbation or no impact on on this disorder yeah so uh there's a lot to unpack there um I'll try to go one step at a time and if I miss something please remember no and I tend to ask these three-part questions specifically of neurosurgeons because I like to challenge you guys ,0
because again you are the astronauts of Neuroscience also I'm just going to take a moment to poke at neurosurgery because I have a couple close friends um who are neurosurgeons and I consider Casey Randy I don't know if he considers me a friend but of course I am a friend I'm teasing there too which is first of all they all have incredible hands right ,0
they have I'm not they all guard their hands with the kind of um uh protection that you would guard the the tools of the most important tools of your trade so they're very careful with their hands you're not going to see them doing heavy deadlifts you're not because of the way that impacts the motor neurons it's all about ,0
fine control yes um so if your neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts you might want to consider getting a different neurosurgery I hope I didn't put anyone out of work there and then the other the other thing is that um you all are tend to be very calm people at least on the exterior we'll return to ,0
this later okay um but I do throw three or four questions out at once so so elevated autonomic arousal and alertness as well as decrease autonomic arousal and alertness both seem to be able to lead to binging and then there's this question of how do you know whether or not to stimulate or to ablate or whether ,0
or not to leave a structure alone in other words what does one of these experiments look like in the laboratory yeah sort of a clinic excuse me yeah of course yeah these are questions I think about all the time um and um I do want to come back to the deadlifting comment but I ,0
um regarding and you and you referred to this earlier as well and I don't know if I've addressed it sufficiently either is is sort of like what what comes first here or how does this develop um I I think first of all I I like to understand these kinds of ,0
problems in in sort of the the construct of what I I consider to be a bit of a two-hit hypothesis um so you sort of need like in the concussion literature you need the second hit is can be devastating so if you have a concussion you know you want to only return to play when your symptoms are gone uh and cleared by a ,0
physician um so uh in the context of Eating Disorders or let's say binge eating disorder first of all I I didn't mention earlier but this is the most common eating disorder affects anywhere between three and five percent of the population wow um and it's probably ,0
under-diagnosed in obesity by the way and if obesity affects 35 of our population most likely binging disorder affects more than three to five percent but that's that's the current uh literature uh estimate on on the prevalence so um how do we develop a gene disorder and is it related to this anxiety ,0
question um you know I think that there is a predisposition that's the first hit um I actually think all humans have this predisposition just some have it more than others um I don't think that we've evolved to ,0
live in a society where foods are so readily available and enormously delicious and have so much sugar and fat in them not that there's any particular problem with either of these macronutrients it's just the excess of it and how they're refined uh that I think is the problem um ,0
you know those high fructose corn syrup in almost everything we eat we it's in bread I don't even know why it's in bread sometimes it's just kind of crazy so so I don't I don't think we're evolved to live in a society um that that has food that's so readily available like that ,0
um and cheap by the way in fact the cheaper the foods are sort of the the more refined and palatable and I would argue dangerous to eat I think they change our reward circuits for the worse um and put us at risk for wanting more um I tend to get a headache when I eat food like that and and perhaps that's uh ,0
evolutionary Advantage because I don't want to eat those Foods because they actually do make me sick um so um in a lot of ways I kind of wish that headache on everybody because perhaps we wouldn't have all these problems uh or at least some of them would go away ,0
so I think that's the first issue is a predisposition to uh or a vulnerability to these types of foods um which we undoubtedly all have to a certain extent but some more than others and then and then and that's so that's the first hit is this predisposition in the context of ,0
this sort of food focused Society and then the second hit is probably a stressful event or a stressful life um and probably a recurring stressful event I'm not sure this is published I've never sat down with like a eating disorder expert and and had this question about how this develops and I'm ,0
not sure it's actually well well known um but in a lot of ways I think that that answer anybody would agree with that we need sort of a predisposition in the exposure the environmental exposure and the genetic predisposition um but also a stressor and that stressor is ,0
probably one that's recurring and you know it's obvious in our society these stressors are everywhere and how we can manage them is is often poor and you know I think we can all relate with that and then there's something else in the background that I think is really important to mention is that patients with these kinds of problems are ,0
embarrassed because our society doesn't think fondly of these kinds of patients you know binging disorder patients they do tend to be overweight that's obviously a stigma obese obesity is another stigma then there's the opposite in a way it's an opposite by the way for a phenotype standpoint is that anorexia I mean that's another stigma and you ,0
know gosh you know not to make this about one sex over another but when when girls are told they're pretty because they're thin it just reinforces this problem and of course you want to complement people and make them feel good about themselves but the problem is that in this vulnerable society that that can lead to problems ,0
because people start thinking oh I should be thin or thinner um so I I think that it's a little bit of a societal understanding that our brains are very vulnerable and I think that will really help changing Society is hard and most of society is not you know ill meaning uh it's all done by accident ,0
um but that is the society that we live in so if we can try to improve that stigma uh and and be kinder to people in that way I think a lot of these problems would get better people that are obese that feel embarrassed by their obesity it doesn't help it only makes it worse because they give up same thing might be true for anorexics ,0
so I really think it's important to consider all of these things and that's why it's so complicated and it would be so hard to do a well-controlled study to understand it better because there's so many of these variables to control for that you really can't control for you might be able to control for them in a mouse's home cage but not not in the ,0
society that we live in so so that that's kind of my brief uh sort of summary of how I would answer your first question then I think you know your second question I I sort of take that as well how do you study such a complicated problem in the operating room and and in the clinic because I mentioned the operating room ,0
because that's sort of the first step here first we want to we have uh just to clarify we have a nih-funded uh trial approved by the FDA for for research to do this first in human study um we've treated two patients we have four more to come at Penn in um and in this study uh it's something I've been working towards my entire career ,0
what we don't know is where in the nucleus accumbens will we identify cells or regions that seem to be uh involved in this sort of reward seeking Behavior I would call it a peditive it's kind of like appetite but the word repetitive is I think a a good word to ,0
use what part of the nucleus Cummins is repetitive is the whole thing repetitive probably not it's huge in my world it's huge as a neurosurgeon you know I Target parts of the brain that are three or four millimeters in size the nucleus accumbens is almost a centimeter in size wow I didn't realize it was that large yeah it sort of like reminds me of ,0
discussions around the amygdala everyone thinks amygdala fear but Miguel has got a lot of different sub-regions and stimulation of certain areas of the megdala makes people feel great that's right another stimulation of other errors makes them feel terribly afraid exactly and that shouldn't surprise us because you know when we treat patients ,0
with Parkinson's disease for Tremor you know if we're in one part of the subthalamic nucleus will help their Tremor if we're in another part of the subthalamic nucleus the neurologist is looking at me like why isn't this working and that shouldn't surprise us we already know that you know two or three millimeters deviation or two or ,0
three millimeters away from where we want to be and you might not have the result you want and that's probably also truth for these more limbic structures like the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens uh so you know regarding the nucleus accumbens we Traverse some of the nucleus accumbens not all of it in order to place the electrode that we ,0
want to use to detect when Cravings are happening for example and to try to block the Cravings from leading to the behavior related to the the reward seeking which is the overeating in this case uh so what we decided to do in the operating room was ,0
to actually try to leverage a tool that we use all the time when we take care of patients with Parkinson's so with Parkinson's these a lot of these patients not all have Tremor and so when we place an electrode into this motor structure to try to improve their movement disorder we often can hear Trevor cells ,0
and they sound we convert their electrical signal to an audible signal so we can actually hear it um and it sounds kind of like the Tremor looks like the frequency of the signal is the same as the handshaking exactly and so the the patient with Parkinson's is is Trump trembling Yep they're awake and you're poking around ,0
in a in a dedicated careful way of course one poke at a time one poke at a time with a very fine wire a set of wires listening to the electrical activity until you you encounter some cells that are sending out electrical activity that's right at a similar frequency exactly and then you can stimulate them or quiet ,0
them and see if the Tremor goes away so we we are very confident that when we stimulate that area of in this case the subcollamic nucleus uh we will make that Tremor we will disrupt that Tremor circuit and that Tremor will dissolve and it does that's why Parkinson's is so beautiful and inspiring and uh from us retractable ,0
yeah exactly but what is the it makes us feel we understand the brain right at least in that limited way so what is the um analog to Tremor in terms of appetite and desire to binge craving so craving is a term that you know there's probably other terms we could use by the way but that that's the term we've chosen to use for a number of ,0
reasons one because people relate with that term people that have binge eating disorder or obesity they if you ask them if they crave the answer will often be yes um if you ask them if they lose control or binge they might not know what you mean or they might not actually feel out of control even when they are ,0
um so uh but the word craving is relatable and so we set out to see if we could identify craving cells um in a patient with OCD which is related in fact we target a very similar part of the brain we tried to identify cells related to obsessions and we believe we did do that it was a single ,0
case study uh where we tried to optimize where our electrode was placed so we had some proof of concept that we would be able to elicit a sort of disease-specific symptom in the operating room assuming the patient could tolerate being awake not everybody needs to be awake for this procedure but at least for these first and human ,0
trials where um we're trying we're trying to establish where in the brain we need to be uh I think this type of approach is really critical and you know by the way none of this has been published uh but I think it's so important for people to know this so I I am willing to share some aspects of what ,0
we're trying to do um but uh but that's that's really the first goal of this trial is to identify where the nucleus accumbens we can detect these craving cells so we have to provoke food craving in the operating room that's the first thing how do you do that ah well um there are some uh somewhat validated ways to do that so ,0
for example we asked patients to provide pictures of food that they rate very highly as something that they would typically crave and you know depending on the patient it might be something that's very salty it could be very sweet like a donut um oh that's very good I love donuts right Donuts are great you should you ,0
should try the Cronut when you're here in New York City I just might I try not to eat that sort of thing for all the reasons just try to stop yourself after that one so if I were one of these patients given the fact that uh the binges come on pretty seldom once a day do you you I imagine you have them come to the the ,0
operating room fasted or semi-fasted they're faster okay they're fasted which probably they're probably surgical reasons for wanting that too they kind of have to be right and then you they've you've done the craniotomy removed a patch of skull yes you've lowered the wire into the nucleus accumbens and then they are viewing pictures of food that ,0
they crave and thinking of about it do they have olfactory cues smells of cronuts yeah I would love to do the olfactory because we haven't implemented that but that is a great uh thank you for and I'll give you full credit when we do review the grant but it sounds I'm so glad this work is funded because I mean this is what I I'll make this time ,0
it's not a joke when I refer to you all uh you neurosurgeons uh as the astronauts of the brain you know this is out on the extreme edge of what we don't know about how the brain functions and this is so far and away different than giving a mouse access to a high high fat food not that I'm not being disparaging in the ,0
mouse work but so the person says well I'm the patient in this case so I might say you know I'm hungry a donut sounds really good right now but craving to me is like I you know I'll cross the street cross town be late for my meeting eat three of these yes maybe even hide that from somebody that cares about me that doesn't want me doing this this ,0
relate with a lot of the research that I do and I remember I got married in my third year the year after my second year and my wife and I or my fiance at the time we started going to the gym together in the morning and my hours were a little better so I would actually be able to exercise before I operated that day and I operated almost every day ,0
as a third year resident so I remember I'd get to the gym really early in three months I lost like 20 pounds and I wasn't trying to lose weight I just was sleeping better and taking care of myself and I remember when we got married I I you know I fit into a tuxedo that I had in college or it would have fit me in college it actually was a new ,0
tuxedo admittedly but it was the same size as my tuxedo from college so I I think that um I've always related with the problems that our our patients have to a certain extent and you know I when I've been most vulnerable which is what I was working the hardest with the least amount of sleep I I related with it the most and ,0
yes exercise for me has always been my tool um more recently exercise some some you know strength training I think is important compared with cardio um I don't do enough of either um but I definitely do some and that helps meditation helps me a bit we I do that every night before I go to sleep ,0
um you know I I use an app for it it's probably not the best way to do meditation but if it keeps you doing it regularly that's the best way to do it Andrew I couldn't agree with you more you know it's one of those things where I look forward to it every night and you know sometimes my wife falls asleep and ,0
I come to bed a little later and I whisper I'm like are you okay if I turn the app on so you know she does the same to me because I think we both value it and I think that's that that's been very helpful I didn't have that tool probably what I needed it most but I have it now and it's very helpful I really appreciate you sharing those ,0
kind of thing hide it from myself yes these kinds of behaviors I'm projecting and I'm fortunate that um I I have cravings for things in life but uh Donuts are not among the more extreme of them so um so this is all happening in real time and you're listening to the cells the same way you would listen to it and ,0
search for Tremor cells exactly same exact tools and you're doing that by um recording from a small population of cells in the area yeah in fact we do get multi-unit activity which is multiple cells uh but we really try to find one a single unit to listen to one neuron yeah because it's just um much easier to understand what that one neuron is doing ,0
versus trying to listen to and we also measure local field potential recordings but those are analyzed which is more of a population response thousands of cells kind of a porous of cells exactly um that we measure offline um the device that we use to um sort of treat these patients or ,0
intervene uh that we're studying it can't do single unit recordings it's only doing these more population responses so we correlate what we see in the operating room at the single unit level to the population response but we do that all offline um I can explain that in a moment uh but yes so we we try to identify these ,0
craving cells and uh because this is a feasibility study um and we can't you know be in the operating I'm searching for hours and hours and hours we do have some sort of we have guidelines that we've set for ourselves that we've uh developed with the NIH or the FDA to make sure that what we're ,0
doing is feasible and safe as well um so we we will spend a limited time trying to identify these uh craving cells but another uh sort of um strategy that we think is really important is um the effect of the stimulation so a lot of patients and this gets to sort of your question earlier about what kind of ,0
what comes first um you know a lot of people when they when they binge or they lose control over food um or seek drugs that moment of vulnerability is preceded by what we call a a moment of sort of pre-meal negative effect which basically means right before they binge they're ,0
feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious and they compensate for that momentary symptom by binging or losing control over food not everybody needs criteria for a binge so I try to specify that we are we are looking at loss of control eating specifically just because the Criterion of a binge is not as critical ,0
for us um so um so what we want to be able to do is trigger stimulation when this craving is detected by the device uh but we trigger it only when the craving is there and we believe that if we can sort of temporarily Elevate their mood ever so ,0
briefly again this is about five to ten seconds of stimulation only that perhaps that elevation in mood could actually sort of disrupt the craving to binge cycle maybe that's a habit maybe it's not but if you crave and then you binge if we can interrupt that with this moment of ,0
feeling good that might be a really good therapy for a patient and in fact when we do deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder we can fairly reliably induce a positive affect the problem is that it's not sustained and the reason it's likely not sustained is because with obsessive-compulsive ,0
disorder we treat that condition with continuous stimulation and it's not surprising that over time the effect kind of goes away so when they're in the clinic and we turn the device on our patients feel great and we feel like we've solved the problem but they call us the next day and they're like you know my my depression ,0
came back or my OCD hasn't gotten better and my moods back to where it was can you can you get it back to where it was yesterday because that felt great the brain loves homeostatic regulation it does and it does not like to shift patterns regression to the norm right um and I think there's sort of a tolerance effect there ,0
um that uh is is limiting the effect of continuous stimulation and actually in a mouse if you do continuous stimulation um the the sort of blockade of binge eating goes away so actually in a mouse we've actually demonstrated um we published this not too long ago in pnas that if you deliver stimulation intermittently and only when sort of a ,0
craving signal is detected so to speak um that that X that effect will be the most robust and durable um but if you deliver it continuously actually the benefit goes away over time so I've always encouraged my colleagues to consider more of an episodic stimulation approach rather than ,0
continuous deep brain stimulation but of course that that's for these more episodic conditions whereas these more quote unquote State disorders uh as I oversimplified earlier they might need more of a continuous therapy so that's definitely subject for a lot of research in the future um so in any case um the goal in the ,0
operating room was to identify a craving cell um deliver stimulation safely but also to capture a moment of elevated mood we were able uh to do that as we we are in our OCD patients as well and also to get an interoperative CAT scan we have devices now in the operating room that allow us to get ,0
stimulant which I was quite happy to to stop because it did make me feel too alert couldn't sleep well Etc that the Superstition went away as well and I'm guessing this has something to do with some of the reward circuitry as it's called related to stimulants again I am not encouraging anyone to take ,1
I have a good friend who actually a famous neuroscientist I won't mention who it is who's worked very hard to suppress his his blinking tits and when he gets fatigued it comes back and and um he's very high functioning yes in his personal life and his professional life but but when you're talking to him and he starts doing this so you kind of ,1
stimulant you know I think I think your brain was very vulnerable to it you know you you sort of may have had a predisposition to it um you mentioned that you have you're a little obsessive and with the tick there maybe you have this kind of you know on the on the mild side of the spectrum OCD um and I I probably do as well by the ,1
understanding and a tailored treatment to the nucleus accumbens specifically we've learned in mice that if you expose a mouse now this is just a model if you expose a mouse to high fat food not food that they would normally eat food that is like 60 fat high fat it's like butter um we've learned that if you expose them to ,1
food like that within two weeks their nucleus accumbens is not functioning like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food there's aspects of it that are hyperactive I could say and there's aspects of it that are hypoactive or decreased activity but either way it's it's not functioning properly and most likely that function ,1
Imaging in real time they're fabulous tools that we didn't have 10 years ago so we can confirm accuracy um you know where the you can see where the electrode is exactly precisely exactly um you know with 0.5 millimeters of air so super precise uh or as precise as we think we need to be ,0
um and we use connectomics so there's a tool in brain Imaging called tractography where we can actually measure circuit connections it's it's an indirect assay but we believe it's powerful it has its uh assumptions but um like anything in in science but we could actually map out where the nucleus accumbens ,0
connects to the prefrontal cortex sort of the cortical control inhibitory control pathway and where that pathway intersects with the nucleus accumbens and we can Target that area um structurally so those three goals of the surgery we we aim to set up to accomplish and we believed if we achieved two of those three that we ,0
would have a successful result in our in our early trial amazing given that at least to me the non-clination that anorexia is the mirror image of binge eating disorder and at least from what I learned one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um but also quite common yes ,0
um is it possible that nucleus accumbens this so-called reward circuit is also involved in anorexia but somehow it is the resistance to eating the craving of the fasted state or something like that that's being reinforced and and I asked this for two reasons one because I'm ,0
genuinely curious about anorexia of observed anorexia in a number of people that I know and it's a striking thing to see somebody just resist food despite all better knowledge of the fact that they're getting quite ill maybe even at risk of death but the other reason is that ,0
if in fact nucleus accumbens is the site which can Harbor cells to promote craving and craving of fasted States so to speak then that I think might tell us something fundamental about how the brain works which is that structures don't control functions per se structures control dynamics of interactions sort of like a ,0
Orchestra conductor has a certain number of operations that they perform but really their main function is to coordinate the actions of a lot of things not to make sure that the violins always play in a certain way alongside the oboes you can tell I'm not a musician here I actually have an appreciation for the ,0
openings yes those usually get left out what's that the obos yeah they usually get ignored my partner plays the elbows oh yeah so yeah I think it's a great analogy by the way um you know I I make this statement it's a little controversial but I actually think people would understand where it's ,0
where I'm coming from um across all of these sort of sub-specialties of medicine uh but I actually think especially with obesity remember it's a phenotype that's reflective uh often but not always of a behavior um but if you consider patients that have obesity and they they exhibit some ,0
sort of compulsion towards food so they they overeat despite the risk of it I think those kinds of patients are more similar to anorexics than they are different um anorexia and obesity are both phenotypes that are at least in this specific case of obesity and in anorexia a result of a compulsion to either over ,0
or under eat despite the risk these types of compulsions are driven by societal pressures brain vulnerabilities that are probably more similar than they are different they just happen to manifest differently why they manifest differently is probably related to each predisposition or perhaps preference that's hard to ,0
know like you I have a personal connection to these Eating Disorders anorexia included and uh yeah I think it's um it's very scary and it's a condition that often instills fear in psychiatrists because I think you know not not everybody by the way I mean I have some ,0
phenomenal psychiatrists that I work with both at Stanford and at Penn they're also involved in my obesity study that take care of these patients I mean these are heroes but there's a lot of psychiatrists that are not in this domain that find anorexia scared for the reason you said it has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions ,0
that includes depression because not only can these patients die of suicide but they die of metabolic complications of being underweight um so it's a uh it is it is a scary condition I I relate with that I am trying over time to bridge what I'm doing in obesity and binging disorder to atorexia for two reasons one because I ,0
think these problems are more similar than they are different and two because of the need um and I think we're well positioned to sort of tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical but but similar approaches um the nucleus accumbens has been studied in patients with anorexia in China ,0
actually my postdoc my first postdoc who I had the honor to train uh when I was at Stanford as a neurosurgeon in China when before he came to me actually was involved in a trial of anorexia that had some benefits um and uh there's studies in Europe um and elsewhere that have examined preliminarily uh the effects of deep ,0
brain stimulation targeting the nucleus accumbens uh for anorexia colleagues of mine in Canada Andres lozado is a wonderful neurosurgeon scientist has been studying the effects of going after Area 25 which is directly connected to the nucleus accumbens by um you know it's a monosynaptic connection so in a lot of ways you know ,0
perhaps delivering stimulation there could could be very similar to delivering stimulation with nucleus accumbens it's all part of one critical inhibitory control circuit he's seen benefits as well um so I I definitely think there's some evidence that this is an area that we ,0
need to be studying um I think our more episodic approach with response to stimulation going after sort of a signal in the nucleus accumbens that seems to be related to the compulsion to withhold from eating I think is what we will be trying to accomplish uh in our study it's a right now just being conceived though uh ,0
yeah these studies they move so slowly because you have to get a grant that Grant gets reviewed by the NIH six months after you submit it often gets rejected because it's too Innovative and too high risk so then you have to edit it and decrease the risk so it takes by obesity so it took two years to get funded ,0
and I worry about that time frame because that's a lot of time for patients with anorexia to suffer that I might be able to help at least in a small sample of patients so um but that that is the nature of how these things go you also have to get FDA approval to do these kinds of things we try to do all of this in parallel it's ,0
an enormous undertaking and in a lot of ways we're starting from scratch but in some ways we have some preliminary data to go after this so my hope is in about a year we'll have a similar trial for anorexia at Penn so so more to come on that um and and we're not the only lab that's trying to go after because of the the ,0
clear need so what is the status of non-invasive brain stimulation ablation and blocking activity in the brain I get a lot of questions about transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah I've actually had that done as a research subject sure when I was at Berkeley Rich Ivory's lab put a coil on my head I was tapping my finger in concert to a uh a drum beat ,0
and then all of a sudden uh because of the stimulation it was impossible for me to keep time yes with the drum beat that's cool cool it's a pretty wild experience to not have motor control and uh than to have motor control returned at the flip of a switch when someone else is controlling the switch it makes it especially Eerie ,0
um so my understanding is that transcranial magnetic stimulation is being used to treat depression and a number of other brain syndromes non-invasively so no no drilling through the skull the surgeons don't like that surgeons love to cut and drill with purpose but they do um but uh my understanding is that the ,0
spatial Precision isn't that great um ultrasound is something I hear a lot about these days um and my understanding is that ultrasound can allow researchers and clinicians to stimulate specific brain areas perhaps with more Precision um maybe you could just give us a coverage of what those are being used ,0
for what are your thoughts on on um uh these forms of non-invasive meaning no no flipping open of a piece of the skull type brain stimulation and blockade of brain activity sure yeah I wanted to clarify also these these surgeries generally don't um by the way require a full craniotomy it's usually just a small opening about ,0
the size of a dime in the bone so just just to clarify but that's painless too right uh well usually without pain yeah there's a little bit of scalp numbing we give a scalp block and the patients are getting IV sedations so they in general don't feel anything and if they do they tell me and we give them more local anesthetic but that's they're usually ,0
asleep during that part so it's minimally invasive but you know in a lot of ways there's no such thing as a minimally invasive procedure in the brain you know it's a it's kind of so glad to hear you say that oh no I you know I'm I'm not one of those neurosurgeons that you've probably encountered and we have mutual friends ,0
that uh and you know these mutual friends are some of my favorite people in neurosurgery and they probably actually think more like me than than not but there are neurosurgeons that you're absolutely right and this is true for all surgeries they really in a lot of ways they think what they do is sort of the ground truth or is it ,0
closer to the ground truth and I I get that um uh you know probing with purpose I I actually really like that I'm going to use that if you don't mind um just it's just describing what you do so yeah but I I actually have I've always said this I've said it publicly I've said it to my boss I've said this ,0
to my team um we need to embrace non-invasive approaches um some of them are a little fluffy um fluffy in that we don't understand how they work we don't necessarily understand how deep brains too much works by the way so ,0
um but because we don't know exactly how they work they're not as precise as we would like them to be so we have work to do there and I actually think that work is doable and actually underway um you know at Stanford we have great collaborators that that I think are doing this people like Nolan Williams ,0
and Connor Liston at Cornell and others um so we uh I think that TMS transcranial magnetic stimulation it is FDA approved for depression by the way it's also FDA approved for OCD and for nicotine addiction where do they put the coil for those three or more or less yeah so they put it over was always on the scalp and uh over the frontal lobe ,0
and there's different parts of the frontal lobe that have been demonstrated to be a little better or a little bit worse um but what the FDA has approved for depression I believe is uh similar to what's been approved for uh OCD but for addiction I believe it is a different Target but we'd have to ask our our TMS ,0
experts on that can they direct the transcranial magnetic stimulation deep below the cortex they try uh and we're we're actually studying this in OCD patients now um I as a part of our invasive trial uh where we are trying to pull patients from a TMS trial that's in parallel to what we're doing ,0
um all funded by the foundation for OCD research where we believe we can use TMs to to define a circuit that if modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily and in those patients if it's temporary they would be appropriate for an invasive study so something we're actively working on I've always believed that ,0
neurosurgeons need to be part of the discussion with these non-invasive approaches we don't need to do them but I think we can help make them more precise and to probe non-invasively with purpose rather than this more kind of I don't know a non-invasive blast effect kind of you know ,0
I I just can't imagine how that is going to be as effective as probing with purpose but you can do that not invasively as well and I think we need to do better uh in that way I do believe that's possible and I think people are actively trying to do it um getting deep in the brain with TMS I think will always be hard but you can ,0
get there indirectly by using connectivity assays and targeting superficial structures that have High connectivity to deep structures so for example um perhaps one day there will be a TMS Target for anorexia and obesity if we are scratching the surface with invasive approaches to these problems ,0
we we're even doing less with the brain stimulation um so we have so much work to do there eating disorders and TMS have been so um sort of scarcely studied or or there have been so such little research done in that in that space and so it is an area that we need to to work on um for the obvious reason for example in ,0
a patient with anorexia just thinking practically you know placing a device in a patient who is significantly underweight might not be the best approach you know wound erosion and issues like that could come up so developing a non-invasive approach I think is critical the problem is where do we target ,0
and so the only way to answer that I think reliably is to accept that we have to get into the Brain before we're out of the brain and with these kinds of conditions we're only just starting to get into the brain you know so I I worry that we're a long way away from a non-invasive approach that really works consistently ,0
um sorry to interrupt um I want to make sure we touch on ultrasound because yes um but um his historically it seemed that there was a bit more permission for people to probe around in the human brain I I've um sometimes refer the podcast to some of these papers that were done uh allowing patients to self-stimulate in the brain ,0
these are work done in the in the 60s and now his name Escapes Me Robert um anyway there's a couple papers published in science allowing patients to stimulate a couple different brain areas asking which ones they preferred and I was always shocked and slightly intrigued by the fact that the the brain area that all three of these patients ,0
who I don't think had any syndromes I think they volunteered for these experiments I don't think you could do this anymore yes um regulatory yeah yeah I think uh was not the same as it is now things have changed um fortunately but they um all three of them seem to like some midline thalamic structure which for ,0
those listening it's just area kind of in the in the dead center of the brain um more or less that evoked a sense of kind of frustration and anger which surprised me because I would have thought oh it's Robert Heath his experiments rather than patients preferring to stimulate areas that evoke laughter or Joy or a feeling of ,0
drunkenness or Delight it also explains a lot of what I observe in social media this sort of um kind of people repeatedly engaging in battles um that are kind of trivial it seems like frustration and anger might have its own reward circuitry anyway I don't want to go too far down that rabbit hole but it ,0
um it's a deep one it's a deep one and and kind of gets to our nature yeah you know as humans and what we find interesting or rewarding but you know the ability the inability to probe around the brain in a safe way without the need for somebody to be very sick would be I think would be enormously powerful and at least in my mind if I ,0
were in charge which I'm not um would offer the opportunity to really come to an understanding about how the human brain works without all these issues of how to translate from Mouse studies and again there's huge value to animal studies as we both agree but um so many of the things that we want to know about the human brain involve ,0
asking the person hey do you what do you feel when that set of neurons is stimulated and what don't you feel uh and a mouse we can ask and ask but they're not going to tell us something they do tell us they're not going to tell us in English so um how do we overcome this challenge but first ,0
ultrasound or if you prefer after ultrasound what is ultrasound going to be really useful towards solving these clinical issues and these basic issues yeah so I think um let's start with ultrasound then we'll come back to it um so ultrasound right now ,0
transcranial magnetic magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound so um uh this this is an FDA approved method to deliver an ablation to the brain non-invasively there are researchers myself included ,0
that are trying to use transcranial magnetic guided magnetic resonance guided Focus ultrasound or MRI guided Focus ultrasound to use it in a modulatory way not just as an ablation but to drive neuronal activity or inhibit it perhaps we're still learning how to do that um there are trials that are trying to ,0
understand if you can use ultrasound to open the blood-brain barrier so you can deliver a medication to that specific area uh perhaps for a brain tumor or something like that so um it's a very exciting field um and it is FDA approved for Tremor right now and so I actually do it routinely ,0
um for patients with Tremor with Parkinson's or a central Tremor and so um I I love doing it it's uh often just kind of a miracle because there's no incision I don't have to place an electrode into the brain to achieve a similar result how early into the pathology of Parkinson's can someone ,0
think about approaching this so for instance if somebody has a parent or a sibling and they're developing some resting Tremor yeah obviously they should talk to a neurologist but a neurosurgeon but this non-invasive approach could be incredible for them as opposed to just take only taking drugs to increase dopamine levels yeah so um ,0
depending on the reason you have Tremor would dictate the kind of medication you would use it could be Parkinson's but if it's not it might be a central Trevor by the way essential tremors 10 times as common as Parkinson's really essential tremor is the most common neurologic condition in patients over the age of 70. we often aren't aware of that people ,0
with essential Trevor feel they have their forgotten disease because there's no Michael J fox for a central Tremor I sent a letter sorry is it essential tremor or or essential um I actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton I I've observed uh Tremor in him and I think he's actually disclosed that he ,0
has it and I hoped he'd become a champion for for patients with a central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor does as well she's also public about it but I I was not able to get them eager to become the champion for this condition but like Michael J fox these patients need a champion like that um but unfortunately it's a bit of a ,0
forgotten disease nevertheless because of the FDA approval of focus ultrasound for Tremor um another's trying to get some attention for sure and uh it's fabulously effective for these patients it treats patients on one side usually their dominant hand or their worst hand and it um it really speaks to the fact ,0
that wow you can deliver non-invasively an ablation to the brain in a hypothesized zone that we think is related to the problem at hand and at least with Tremor it works really well could this be effective for psychiatric disease obesity Eating Disorders uh well um perhaps uh actually that would be the ideal the problem is we don't know where ,0
to do the ablation um there is a trial that we would like to do for OCD where we would deliver an ablation to the same area of the brain that we've been delivering ablations to for years for patients with OCD and it helps a bit that's called a capsulotomy um but really the outcome is probably going to be about the same it's a nice ,0
method because it's non-invasive but we need to find a new Target for these for these conditions and because of the common denominator of the urge despite the risk sort of that compulsion um yeah perhaps it could be the same Target I don't know um but I would argue we need to do these modulatory experiments either with a ,0
device or with uh invasive recordings uh to better understand where these problems are coming from to Define where we should do an ultrasound treatment so um you're right historically without much regulation we've we've probed the brain um the problem we can't learn a lot from ,0
those experiments now uh well in this way at least we don't know exactly where those electrodes were we didn't have MRI scanning or high quality cat scanning to to know where those electrodes were with certainty where and we know two or three millimeters matters and we also didn't have the tools to place electrodes in a ,0
precise way back then so unfortunately we can't learn a lot from those experiments right now so we're sort of redesigning them and there is a way to do it now um patients with epilepsy benefit from this all the time there has been a revolution in America it was in Europe before it was in America where we would ,0
do stereo encephalography which is basically like doing an EEG of patients with epilepsy but with invasive electrodes and we would Place tiny little wires less than a millimeter in diameter all throughout the brain into parts of the brain that we believe are involved in seizures and we would admit the patients to the hospital and figure ,0
out where the seizures were starting and propagating and then um you know we could stimulate these electrodes to see if there was a symptom that was important and I try to identify a region that we thought we could either remove surgically ablate with a laser or put a stimulator in it perhaps that's commonplace now for epilepsy ,0
um and it works extremely well and it's very safe of course it's still a brain procedure but the uh the complication rate is surprisingly low quite honestly for the amount of electors that we place um and it's extremely well tolerated most these patients leave the hospital and they don't even feel like they've ,0
had surgery so uh there's actually a lot of interest in using that procedure to study mental health disorders we are trying to do it for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder we're awaiting an FDA decision on that uh but actually I credit uh our colleagues at Baylor and at UCSF for for studying this ,0
uh already we have fabulous colleagues at UCSF that have studied depression using this type of approach a mutual friend of ours uh you know Eddie Chang who's a wonderful friend and colleague somebody I've emulated for many years as well uh and and the the Psychiatry team at UCSF have worked together on this sort of ,0
bringing together the epilepsy technique and the Psychiatry expertise to study how we could better Target electrodes in depression and I'll tell you if they have a consistent Target perhaps there becomes an ultrasound Target um but right now the approach is a bit more reversible because you can always ,0
shut that electrode off or even remove the electrode if perhaps it's not in the optimal location to treat the depression uh but actually after a large volume of cases perhaps they could pool that data to develop a a new ultrasound Target for depression I think that would be fabulous and probably is their long-term goal ,0
um not to speak for them but that would be something that I I'm sure is on their radar and a Baylor is trying to do the same thing for depression their approaches are a little bit different but a similar tool to try to understand uh depression and you know we're working with all these types of uh colleagues some of these are our friends to try to ,0
to bring this to OCD as well and you know it makes sense to try to do this for addiction and obesity and anorexia you might ask well why aren't you doing this for obesity right now in uh in our in our study and the reason is that um we've developed a target for obesity uh and binge eating disorder uh developed out of mice that we believe ,0
um is relevant for the human State because you can model this problem in a mouse a bit better than you can model depression or OCD so we feel like we can rely on the pre-clinical studies more whereas with these perhaps more I don't want to say more complicated but more human mental health conditions that are hard to model in a mouse you really have ,0
to study it in the human and you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient a patient that has electrodes and try to provoke a depressed state or study epileptics like Dr Chang has done that have comorbid depression for example and that can really validate this approach as well but in the end it's it's getting into the human brain that we need to do ,0
in the disease specifically that will eventually lead to a non invasive approach either a lesion or modulatory approach modulatory would be like TMS or lesion approach would be with ultrasound couldn't agree more meanwhile because there are many many millions of people suffering from depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's ,0
and essential tremor Etc well first of all I should say based on everything you've told me thus far it's amazing to me that any pharmacologic treatments work because of how systemic they are and impacting serotonin serotonergic neurons over here in dopaminergic neurons over there and not ,0
targeting any specific batch of cells it makes perfect sense as to why all the side effects exist but earlier you said something that really grabbed my attention I want to come back to which is that if people can be made to feel or make themselves feel just a little bit better a little less anxious just prior to a ,0
craving episode or a binge episode maybe even if people can become better at detecting their own internal States and when they're kind of veering toward a binge or veering toward using a drug or maybe even veering towards suicidal thinking I based on what you said earlier that ,0
those kind of um pre-behavioral States the kind of drift on the on the steering um those sound like powerful levels of awareness at least for now until we have specific sites in the brain that we can Target non-invasive methods that could be deployed to ,0
millions and millions of people seems like that awareness seems like maybe among the best tools that people could develop yes 100 agree with you you know so for the person with OCD or uh who suffers from anorexia or binge eating disorder and to their clinicians you know I I just want to highlight that you said that I mean I'm not again I'm not a ,0
clinician I always say this I don't prescribe anything I profess things um and uh but awareness of one's thinking seems immensely powerful in this context yeah um and after all it is the clinical probe that you use because the if let's say the patient were to lie to you about their experience of ,0
what happens in their mind when you stimulate you could basically the whole thing the whole surgery the whole procedure could go badly wrong so it's it's up to the patient to be of course honest with you in their their incentivized to do that but to be honest with themselves about ah you know I've gone all day without a binge but you ,0
know the the smell of a donut or the thought of a donut is starting to have a particular Allure that awareness seems like an incredibly powerful thing to own and to and to build and cultivate yes I've always thought that if we could improve awareness we can improve outcomes I think that's probably true for many of these patients the problem I ,0
think comes down to the fact that some of these patients are so resistant to treatment and the patients that we see as a surgeon for example are the patients that they've tried cognitive behavioral therapy certainly have tried medications they've tried Behavioral Management they are aware of their problem and they've ,0
shown that to us they can tell us when they're craving but despite the craving and despite being involved in this invasive brain surgical trial highly you know first in human novel study which I think will have a positive effect but it's still experimental uh they still can't stop themselves so there ,0
sort of as made aware as could possibly be did I use grammar there correctly I think so um they're as aware as they could possibly be and they still lose control we've had this studied in the lab so we will bring patients to the laboratory with this implanted device to to try to provoke this electrographic ,0
electrical signal that can be detected by the actual device that will stimulate them when they're at home but before we actually initiate stimulation we want us to see can this device detect this craving cell signal which is going to be different than what we saw in the operating room because that's a single cell but these devices ,0
these electrodes are about a millimeter in diameter instead of like a tenth of a millimeter which is what we use in the operating room um so they're they're only hearing or or detecting I should say thousands of cells responses and we actually have a way to provoke binges it's called a mood provocation ,0
it's very well well very well validated it's a little bit like provoking seizures in the epilepsy monitoring unit but here in these sort of uh psychiatric monitoring unit or the the food monitoring unit uh we we actually have a psychiatrist and eating disorder Specialists come and induce a mood that is related to ,0
each patient's sort of self-described binge episode so the psychiatrist comes in and provokes yes a feeling that can evoke the negative behavior that's exactly right so that we can video and synchronize the video to the brain signal recordings um the patients all wear an eye tracker so we can see what they're eating at all ,0
times and what they're looking at specifically and that allows us to have the best temporal resolution possible to understand what is happening right before the bite and even under video surveillance through a one day one-way mirror in a laboratory setting when patients are very well aware that their there to be ,0
studied if they're going to binge they still do and we believe they do because they just can't control it as aware as they are of it and it's probably because they're the most severe so I think if we can improve awareness not just the societal awareness that I was talking about earlier but the ,0
patient awareness around their problem I think that could be a powerful way to help so many of these patients and that's sort of the role of cognitive behavioral therapy um the problem with cognitive behavioral therapy or should say the limitation of it I actually don't have any problem with it I think it's a wonderful ,0
treatment um is that if you stop it many of these patients go back to their old behaviors I don't say old habits but it might be a habit but the old behaviors and so um that's the problem is it's not necessarily lasting in the absence of ,0
continued cognitive behavioral therapy some people can benefit from it long term but some can't uh but I think in in in the less severe patients improving awareness key but in these really refractory patients this is this is kind of like this is the disease despite the awareness they can't control themselves and that's what we're trying ,0
to restore is that improved ability to control their behavior do you think there's a role for machines and artificial intelligence here uh there are a couple Laboratories up at the University of Washington that are using particular signature patterns of within voice to try and help ,0
suicidal people who are suicidally depressed know when they're headed towards an episode before they even can consciously know so this gets right down issues of Free Will and whether or not machines can be smarter than we are but you know one could argue that some of the search algorithms on Google and other search ,0
engines are actually more aware of our preferences than we are um basically what these are these are devices that are listening to people talk all day they're also paying attention to patterns of breathing and how well people slept Etc integrating a huge number of cues and then signaling ,0
somebody with a you know a yellow light like you know you're headed into a depressive episode the person might say I feel fine or I feel pretty good this is kind of Baseline state for me and they say ah this is where you were preceding the last episode that took you down a deep dark trench and it took months to get out of ,0
um I wonder whether or not some of these devices could help with the sorts of things that we're talking about today yeah I think so um I've always said we have to get in the Brain before we get out of it and if we get in the brain and understand what these signals look like we'll know what those non-invasive signals are I think ,0
it's possible that we are scientifically sophisticated enough to use machine learning um and sort of this kind of botan technique to anticipate when somebody is going to be highly impulsive you know suicide it's the most dangerous impulse it's something that is immensely a focus of the lab is ,0
impulsivity we've talked mostly about compulsion compulsion being you know going after a reward or the urge despite the risk um impulsivity is is similar but different it's it's kind of going after something um a little bit if you if you model impulsivity in a mouse it's you know ,0
related to you know going after a food reward without the sort of paired tone that your the mouse is supposed to wait for the mouse doesn't want to wait anymore they just go after the food um I've been that Mouse yeah we've all been oh we could all relate with this uh to a certain extent against the Spectrum so ,0
um so in any case I uh non-sequitur but I I I certainly think that there is a way to use our own body's physiology to anticipate when these impulses are coming online how best to do that I think we're just scratching the surface but these are the kinds of solutions we need these are ,0
some of these problems are of epidemic proportions the largest public health problems in this country in this world obesity opiate crisis depression suicidality I mean that's like a third of our country maybe more probably more and think about it and a colleague of ours at Stanford Psychiatry told me something that still just blows my mind ,0
which is that something like 75 percent of the antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication that exists in the world is consumed in the United States it's amazing which is I mean that's an outrageous number yeah we do have an obsession in this country for pharmacy you know and the pharmaceutical industry is very powerful here and probably ,0
related some aspect of capitalism I'm capitalistic and just like everybody else but um I do worry about that a little bit um but you know we tend to over prescribe and I think we as patients tend to over want medication we like quick Solutions and sometimes medications provided sometimes not or ,0
they're often just abandoned depends on the problem of course so um but but I I agree that we need scalable Solutions but you know I'm a neurosurgeon I'm only going to be able to treat the most severe of patients with these problems you know you know we've only done about 200 000 deep brain ,0
stimulation surgeries ever so I mean the problem we're talking about here is 50 million Americans there's no possibility that surgeons can address that problem but we could help Inspire an initiative to go after that kind of problem or help make it more rigorous because the last thing we need is a you ,0
know some sort of wearable fancy tool that you know uh waste people's money and time you know we need real therapies for these things not that these devices that we're discussing are not uh I think actually there's lots of promise we use machine learning in the lab all the time I'm not a an electrical engineer or the ,0
computational neuroscientist doing this type of work I I just helped develop the hypotheses around it but um and help fundraise around it but I I definitely think there's a future for it I just I I suspect we're scratching the surface on how best to do it let's talk about your hands yeah sure all the neurosurgeons I know are you ,0
know very Faithfully protect their hands because talking about insurance is too expensive that's it right but I'm guessing that you you all are not the ones to reach into the garbage disposal even if your eye is on the switch to make sure that it isn't going to get turned on they're just too precious they are your livelihood yeah um and earlier ,0
we talked about deadlifts uh there are other forms of exercise um they're things like tennis um they're they're drawing and painting a full range of things that one can do with their hands use your imagination sure um is it true that neurosurgeons don't do any uh really like heavy grip ,0
activity because it can refine the motor motor circuits in the brain and elsewhere that can throw off their neurosurgery game I would say that many neurosurgeons uh avoid activities that put their hands at risk um another one by the way you know there's a uh an annual uh softball tournament uh that uh ,0
neurosurgeons come to in New York City in Central Park with a very softball no I'm just kidding well actually it's actually a very you know typical hard softball I don't know why they call it softball and uh actually a two close colleagues of mine have gotten injured at that tournament maybe this is a it's also I must say and here I'm poking fun ,0
but for those of you who are going in the medical profession it's also one of the more uh how should I say this well I'm just going to say it there's a steep hierarchy of training in neurosurgery yes um there's a certain harshness that's been conveyed to me about the training uh much like Astronaut training to be ,0
totally fair and so maybe this is a tactic to uh to weed out either the younger or the older generation it says Evolution right we uh have to evolve and we need in medical the week I guess well I I could say that one of the individuals that got injured is one of the more senior surgeons that I work with now and is one of the best athletes ,0
that I know and he's definitely not weak but you can get injured playing these Sports and uh that being said I can tell you briefly is um I think that you know it's funny my my mother came to me recently she's she has osteopenia and she told me her doctor told her she's not allowed to do deadlifts and I was like okay ,0
um that's fine uh I'm not telling you you should do deadlifts I just don't exactly understand the relationship but um I can say that I do think I'll give you a little story here the reason why I'm being a little hesitant to to confirm that I agree with you on the deadlifts is I um ,0
when I was operating this is when I was at Stanford University operating and uh we as I mentioned earlier we get an interoperative CAT scan uh to confirm accuracy of our lectures I do this for all of my surgeries when I was reviewing that CAT scan the x-ray technician looked at me and said whispered into my ear he's like your posture ,0
really bad embarrassing your physical posture while doing your surgeries yeah and I looked at him and I kind of wanted to say I won't curse but yeah exactly I've been doing it intermittently during our conversation because he made me realize that I really did have bad posture and um we kind of had a little brief aside ,0
and he I learned he was a personal trainer and uh his name was Zach and he uh you know he said to me you know your posture is weak because or your posture is poor because you're weak you need to strengthen your body and strengthen your core I was like how he's like power lifting and I'm like I'm a little hesitant to do this and I'll tell you I ,0
started very slowly and I can't prescribe power lifting to everybody for the exact reason you said um and I've gotten hurt doing it by the way but I do think I I wish I started a little younger and I would argue that with close supervision and very well if you are if you have a very ,0
experienced trainer which I would argue if you're a neurosurgeon or an astronaut uh or or have a highly specialized profession where you need your your limbs to to function dentists things like that um if you're going to take something on like this it really needs to be extremely carefully supervised and I can ,0
tell you that you know my trainer had a profound impact on my life and my posture and my my physical health and so uh we did deadlift I'll admit so when you brought it up I kind of chuckled to myself but uh yes I I have gotten mildly hurt deadlifting but it was when I was doing it by myself and I was kind of cocky and I wasn't paying attention but ,0
when I was with him and he was all over my technique it actually was the most efficient way for me to feel stronger and it improved my posture uh significantly and I I miss him since I left California I I have a new trainer in Philadelphia who's great but uh uh and and I still deadlift occasionally with him but I uh I I can ,0
say I I am opposed to deadlifting callously but if you're extremely well monitored by it experienced um personal trainer or weight lifter uh I think it could be a great exercise great I love to be wrong in this case um because I'm a huge proponent and on the podcast I go on and on I mean ,0
they're so there's so much data now pointing the fact that 100 and 180 to 200 minutes of Zone 2 cardio kind of jogging cycling swimming type behavior is very healthy for everybody and we should all be doing that at least that yes I need to as well and that resistance training on the order of you know six hard sets per muscle group per ,0
week are it's really important just to offset deterioration of muscles and I'm learning skeletal function and tendon strength and that's just to maintain we're not talking about all out sets to Absolute failure but as you point out with um with proper form so even the neurosurgeons are doing this which I think is is wonderful yes as a final ,0
question um but one that I think really or maybe second to final question earlier I commented on the remarkable calm at least perceived calm of neurosurgeons it could be caused or could be effective the training but it's obvious to me why one would want that trait in their neurosurgeon ,0
find for instance that if I started to tremble a little bit if I tapped my left foot that my hand would stabilize a bit that there's this kind of need to move the body or one feels the impulse maybe that's my my Tourette's like compulsions again but but that one can kind of um siphon off some of that energy into another limb so that you could remain ,0
precise so are these sorts of things that I'm talking about are maybe it's entirely my imagination but are these the sorts of things that one learns as a neurosurgeon how to still the body and still the Mind do you have a meditative practice when you go into the operating room if you had a particularly challenging morning or or a poor night's ,0
sleep do you have tools that you use to calibrate yourself and get yourself into the Zone I think this would be very interesting for people to get some insight into even if they don't want to be a neurosurgeon yeah I completely agree and I I appreciate the earlier uh reference to neurosurgeons as uh astronauts because I've also heard you ,0
know us compared to Cowboys before and it's a little bit less flattering I uh you know some of what we do surgically really does require a substantial amount of confidence um and that confidence hopefully comes from years of training and experience um ,0
you always worry that the confidence is sort of misplaced and that that is problematic luckily I you so rarely see that because our training is so rigorous you know we have a board of uh American Board of neurological surgeons that uh sort of allows and and assesses surgeons to continue practice and holds us to a really high bar I do think it tends to ,0
attract a certain personality uh in my sub-specialty as a like a deep brain stimulation surgeon we call it stereotactic and functional neurosurgery you know some people have likened us to the neurologists with a scalpel um we we tend to be a bit more intellectual um uh maybe maybe bedside manner is a ,0
little bit friendlier um and then there's the vascular neurosurgeon who doesn't sleep and so they're not as friendly there's the spine surgeons who operate the most and so they're you know busy busy busy uh we there are some of these kind of reputations going around but I I agree with you there's a sort of a common ,0
feature of of a calmness across neurosurgeons and you know there's some of my obviously my favorite people my closest friends um and I I can relate with them probably because of that um sort of a big picture they don't get sort of uh flustered uh they they tend to ,0
are they tend to be really good at figuring out how to have quality time because we work really hard our hours are uh significant and so the time with our families our friends is less than we would like it to be um that obviously that's true for people who work hard across any profession but definitely true for neurosurgeons and I ,0
think that we're very good at figuring out how to make that time high quality um you know even just texting with some of my friends um in that are that are neurosurgeons a great friend of mine just became chairman at Duke and just connecting with him by text which takes seconds you know you feel we feel connected you know ,0
and I I think that's a that's a trait amongst neurosurgeons we sort of know how to cut to the chase in a way um and prioritize our time it's a skill that we probably have innately but is also part of the training you know when we are interns now there's a lot of work hour regulations that is probably quite ,0
appropriate by the way um I I think our hours before were bordering uh on on uh on not necessarily let's just say they were not ideal for mental health and sleep which we know are very important components um certainly we had no time for meditation I definitely did not I wish I did um now knowing what I know about ,0
meditation my wife's a health coach I I get it I see it I I practice it myself with her um I see the value I wish I had that tool when I was in training because it's stressful um you know you even with workout restrictions we still don't sleep very much we're still at work a lot about 80 ,0
hours you know a week throughout the entire career uh there are times when it's more because after training there's no work hour restrictions so sometimes I feel like as faculty we get abused and the trainees are a little bit more protected now it definitely was the reverse at one point and that's also a huge problem probably more of a problem ,0
um and I'm joking a little bit I don't necessarily think we're abused but certainly our hours are significant um but you know they come a bit more here and there you know on my or days when I'm operating those are long days but on the days that I'm lucky enough to be a researcher you know uh like you those ,0
days tend to be a bit gentler unless I'm great writing those days can be long as you know um so I so to answer your question I do think we're we're sort of self-selected for it but I also think it's part of the training you know we because of the long hours that we're in the hospital we're taking care of sick patients and we have ,0
sort of a type a mentor approach where our mentors are hard on us you know we learn to cope with our stress and be efficient and prioritize things despite the stress of it all and I think you know we take from that this sort of calm demeanor and you know perhaps um perhaps it's just amplifies what we ,0
were probably drawn to because before we come to neurosurgery we want rotated neurosurgery we might spend a month you know pretending to be a neurosurgeon learning from residents and and faculty that are practicing the specialty but you know prior to actually starting your training you you never experience anything like being a resident in ,0
neurosurgery uh the stress and the volume of patients that you have to take care of and the long nights it can be quite Lonely by the way um you develop friends in the hospital but sometimes you're on your own when you're on call and you have backup you can call your chief resident or you're attending but you really have to learn ,0
how to take care of patients yourself you obviously form teams with nurses and staff and things like that and other residents but it can be lonely it can be really challenging and I think because of those experiences that all neurosurgeons go through uh you know we tend to have this sort of unflappable personality that perhaps we ,0
started with a bit compared to the average person but the training definitely amplifies it and do you have tools that you implement if you ever feel that you're getting slightly off-center I do now um you know I ,0
when I was in training I actually remember in my second year so most neurosurgery programs when you're a junior resident in some ways that's your toughest year not in every way um it is your toughest year because you're you're young and you're inexperienced ,0
and you don't know what you don't know and and that that's why it's such a tough year because you have to learn a lot very quickly for patient safety reasons for self-survival you know you just have to learn a lot um and you're on call by yourself in the hospital and it's uh it's a real Challenge and I think that you know I ,0
you know personally I I gained a lot of weight during that year the only exercise I did consciously was taking the stairs I refused to take the elevator and I was at uh Penn at HUB where I currently practice now and I remember I would see patients anywhere from sort of the ground floor where the Chama Bay was or the ER all ,0
the way up to Founders 12th 12th floor and I would never take an elevator that was my rule for the year because I knew I would not have time to exercise but I would just take the stairs and in the beginning of the year I would be a little winded when I got to the 12th floor but by the end of the year actually it didn't really phase me it ,0
became a great Habit to have um the problem with that though is I paired that unfortunately with you know a lot of sleepless nights or not enough sleep let's say and I had this terrible habit of drinking coffee late at night and I would put a lot of sugar in it and it was sort of the only way for me to get a ,0
quick you know um a quick bout of energy that for some reason I prioritized at that time obviously knowing that I would crash which I always did and I always kind of regretted it but I still did it anyway and I I attribute that to poor decision making inexperience um and perhaps being a little vulnerable like I think we all are that's why I ,0
tools a number of people uh I'm guessing out there might want to become neurosurgeons I really believe that in hearing today's conversation that you will spark an interest in medicine and or neurosurgery um well certainly you need to be a a physician before you can become a neurosurgeon so end neurosurgery in some ,0
cases and that would be beautiful and I predict that will be happen that will happen excuse me as a consequence of um what you've shared today I really appreciate your mentioning of the um emphasis and appreciation on quality time uh I very much see this as quality time I know that our listeners were will as well really want to thank you for ,0
taking time out of your not just immensely busy but very important schedule because again the work that you're doing is really out there on that cutting I don't want to say bleeding edge because in this context it's not going to sound right but on that extreme Cutting Edge of what we understand about how the human brain works and how it can ,0
be repaired um they're doing marvelous work will Point people to various places they can find you online and should they need your the help of your clinic to to your clinic and your laboratory as well so on behalf of everybody and and myself as well thank you so so very much I'm honored thank you so much for having me ,0

this podcast not so much today but in many previous episodes of The huberman Lab podcast we talk about supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everybody many people drive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing sleep and focus and hormone optimization the huberman Lab podcast has partnered with momentous supplements ,0
Stanford school of medicine today we are discussing headaches headaches are something that everybody will suffer at some point in their lifetime of course some people suffer from headaches far more often than others and for many people headaches can be incredibly debilitating limiting their ability to work to socialize to sleep to exercise ,0
essentially to live life in any kind of normal way as we'll soon discuss there are many different kinds of headache we have migraine headaches tension headaches cluster headaches today I will review all the different types of headaches and what the underlying biology of each and every one of those types of headaches is as well as ,0
fortunately the many excellent treatments that exist for the different types of headache in fact what we'll soon discuss is that by understanding which type of headache you have and a little bit about the underlying biology of each different type of headache it becomes quite straightforward to select the best treatment options for you to ,0
for instance provide relief from frequent and recurring tension headaches cluster headaches even sinus headaches the sorts of headaches that are associated with sinus infections and colds where the sinuses get clogged up and you experience headache so while today's episode focuses on all aspects and types of headaches it will have ,0
tremendous relevance for everybody so for those of you that experience headache every once in a while where only when you're sick or have a sinus headache or for those of you that suffer from debilitating migraines today's conversation actually has a bit of optimism woven into it meaning there are excellent treatments for each and every ,0
one of the different types of headaches and I was quite impressed and excited to learn when researching this episode that the treatments for headache range from of course prescription drug treatments and over-the-counter medications of the sort of type that most of us have heard about ibuprofen acetaminophen and so forth so-called anti-inflammatory drugs ,0
but it turns out there are many natural treatments for headaches that when compared to those over-the-counter drugs and even some prescription drugs appear to be easily as effective and in many cases more effective than the typical drug treatments many of which can carry side effects that is the drug treatments carry side effects whereas the natural ,0
treatments appear to not carry side effects now of course anytime we have a discussion about natural treatments there are likely to be some eye rolls out there and people thinking oh you know this is going to be a bunch of woo science well far from it as you'll soon learn today each and every one of the treatments for each and every one of the ,0
different kinds of headaches is grounded in solid biological understanding of why that particular treatment ought to work and does work so for instance you'll learn that some headache arises because of muscular pain other headache arises because of excessive vasodilation the arteries and blood vessels get bigger and wider and so there's a pressure and ,0
a swelling within the cranium that people experience as a headache and it turns out that many of the more natural treatments out there can address either the muscular pain issue or the vasodilation issue or other issues and underlying mechanisms for headache so again while headaches are very intrusive irritating and in some cases ,0
debilitating there is certainly light at the end of this tunnel meaning by the end of today's episode each and every one of you will have an array of excellent treatment options that you can choose from in order to address and provide relief from any of the different types of headache before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is ,0
separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is thesis thesis makes custom nootropics and as ,0
many of you know I'm not a fan of the word nootropics because nootropics means smart drugs and as a neuroscientist I can tell you there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart thesis understands this and has designed different nootropics in order to bring your brain into specific States for specific types of work so for instance ,0
for Creative work or to engage with more Focus or to give you more energy for cognitive or physical work so with thesis they'll design custom nootropics for you that will allow you more focus better task switching more creativity and so on and they'll be sure to include only the ingredients that you want and not the ingredients that you don't I've ,0
been using thesis for more than a year now and I can confidently say that their neutropics have been a total game changer for me I like the clarity formula prior to Long bouts of cognitive work or the Energy Formula prior to physical workouts if you'd like to try your own personalized nootropic starter kit go online to takethesis.com huberman ,0
you'll take a brief three-minute quiz and thesis will send you four different formulas to try on your first month again that's takethesis.com huberman and use the code Huber minute checkout for 10 off your first box today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that ,0
means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar I've talked many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve cell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the ,0
body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the proper ratios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ,0
ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished so with element you can make sure that you're staying on top of your hydration and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's lmnt.com huberman and you'll get ,0
a free element sample pack with your purchase they're all delicious so again if you want to try element you can go to element.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Maui Nui which I can confidently say is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building a USDA certified wild harvesting system ,0
to help balance invasive deer populations on the island of Maui I've talked before more on this podcast and we've had guests on this podcast that have emphasized the critical role of getting quality protein not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis but also for repair of all tissues including brain tissue on a day-to-day basis and ,0
the general rule of thumb for that is one gram of quality protein per pound of body weight per day with Maui Nui meats you can accomplish that very easily and you can do that without ingesting in excess of calories which is also critical for immediate and long-term health I should say that Maui Nui meats are not only extremely high quality but ,0
they are also delicious I particularly like they're jerky so they're venison jerky I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes including ground venison some venison steaks and I love the taste of the venison it's lean but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all it's incredibly delicious so if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison go to ,0

and I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding again that's livemomentis.com huberman let's talk about headaches and as we are soon going to learn there are different types of headaches and different types of headaches arise from changes in different types of tissues in the head ,0
area and indeed in the neck area as well now one of the key things to understand is that if you want relief from a headache you need to understand which tissue is mainly involved in creating that type of headache so for instance many people suffer from what are called tension headaches now tension headaches are a little bit of a misnomer because ,0
many people might think oh tension I'm under a lot of tension and stress and therefore I get tension headaches and indeed stress can cause tension headaches but tension headaches are really the sort of headache that you feel around the top part of the head not the very top but sort of where you would put a headband so above the eyes and ,0
around the head it doesn't have to be experienced all the way around the head but the main underlying reason that is the tissue system that mainly underlies tension headaches is the muscular system there are a lot of muscles on the skull Believe It or Not of course on the neck and they allow you to move your neck and head ,0
there are a lot of muscles that lie parallel to the skull and oftentimes those muscles will undergo excessive amounts of constriction now there are of course muscles and the jaw that can also lead to headache and jaw ache and things of that sort and neck aches and headaches so what we're really pointing out here is that the ,0
muscles are a key player in the formation of different types of headache Tension Headache in particular but of course muscles and muscle tension can be evolved in the other types of headaches as well okay so I just want to highlight muscular issues as one particular source of the ache in headaches the other tissue that can be prominently involved ,0
in generating the ache of a headache or the so-called meninges now the meninges in addition to being a fun word to say or a bunch of tissues that line the outside of the brain and reside between the brain and the skull so you might think okay between the brain and the skull there's probably just a little bit of fluid and the brain is right up next ,0
to the skull but it turns out that's not the case the brain is actually encased in a very thick very durable Sac or casing that's wrapped around it tight like Saran wrap it actually has a name which is dura d-u-r-a and so you can remember Dura durable and having done some surgeries many surgeries before on brains of different types ranging from ,0
Human even though I'm not a neurosurgeon as a clinician ranging from Human to other types of species what you find is that the dura is exceedingly durable getting through this thing really requires an a very sharp razor blade so the brain is actually sitting in a very fibrous like Sac that you simply could not open up with your fingertips under ,0
any conditions it's really durable the meninges are in that general area and also encasing the brain and the meninges provide an additional buffer between the brain and the dura and the skull so again you don't want to think about the brain as just sitting right next to the skull it's close by but there are a bunch of other thin fibrous tissues many ,0
of which are very thin and fragile and others of which such as the dura that are very very strong because they're very fibrous almost like a uh if you've ever felt for instance the sale of a of a sailboat you might think oh it's just this big flapping sheet in the wind it is anything but a sheet in the Wind it is a very very strong and durable ,0
material now the proximity of the dura and the meninges to the brain and the fact that everything is wrapped very tightly together and the fact that there's a lot of vasculature so that would be arteries blood vessels and capillaries are all in that area on the top of the brain and throughout the brain the fact that all of that is in ,0
very close proximity and wrapped really tight in this very durable sac is one of the reasons why when blood vessels or arteries or both become dilated they open there creates a pressure between the brain and those tissues and because there isn't much distance between the tissues like the dura and the meninges and the skull ,0
there's also pressure that allows for the brain to literally sneak up or I should say give the impression that your brain is expanding up against your skull so the point here is that while muscular tension can give rise to headache the other thing that can give rise to headache is so-called vasodilation the expansion or the widening of the ,0
arteries blood vessels and capillaries and one of the reasons why that gives rise to headache is because there's simply not a lot of space for that expansion to go it doesn't allow anything except for the brain to push up against that very durable tissue and that very durable tissue to push up against the skull and even though the ,0
brain itself doesn't have pain receptors that's right the brain itself doesn't have pain receptors that is why a neurosurgeon can take off a piece of skull and can probe around in the brain with an electrode and the person is completely unaware and in order to get through the skull of course that little skin flap has to remove be removed from ,0
the skull and that requires a little bit of topical anesthetic but really you don't need any anesthetic to go into the brain itself because there aren't pain receptors on the brain itself however the tissues surrounding the brain such as the dura the meninges and the vasculature that then reaches up believe it or not into the skull the vasculature ,0
doesn't actually stop right beneath the skull it actually blood vessels it get into the skull and they're actually portals by which blood can move within the skull itself well what that means is that since all of the tissues are very close by and very compact with respect to one another any increase in the size of the portals that allow ,0
movement of blood there and the fact that there are what are called nociceptors noci nociceptors These are essentially pain receptors because of the presence of pain receptors in the tissues around the brain when there's an increase in the size of those vascular portals the arteries ,0
capillaries and vessels we experience that as intense pain and pressure and fortunately there are excellent treatments for dealing with that intense pain and pressure but keep in mind that the intense pain and pressure that is the consequence of vasodilation that is the widening of these different vascular portals ,0
is very different than the type of pain that arises from muscular tension as is the case with Tension Headache okay so now we have two sources of pain that is the ache in headache and there are two more that we need to think about in trying to better understand the different types of headaches that we'll discuss and in terms of trying to ,0
understand which are going to be the best treatments for the different types of headaches and those are neural and inflammatory responses so let's talk about the neural type first there is a type of headache that many people unfortunately suffer from we'll get into this in a bunch more detail in a moment but those are called cluster headaches ,0
cluster headaches are headaches that arise not from the surface people don't experience them as kind of a tightening of the forehead and the neck and the jaw but rather it feels as if the headache is coming from deep within the head and in particular from behind the orbit of one or the other eyes and sometimes both eyes for those of you that have ever ,0
experienced cluster headaches they are extremely painful even the more where I should say the relatively more minor cluster headaches are extremely painful and the severe ones are exceedingly painful cluster headaches arise from Deep where this we get the Sensation that they are rising from deep within our head as ,0
opposed from the surface inward because they are neural in origin and there's a particular nerve pathway called the trigeminal nerve that often is the origin of these cluster headaches that people experience behind the eye the trigeminal as the name suggests has three branches try Okay so there's a branch that essentially extends to the ,0
eye there's also a branch that extends to the mandible right to the uh to the lip and there's a branch that extends more or less to the to the nasal area and so this trigeminal nerve becomes inflamed or in other ways is hyper activated in some cases and that causes the Deep pain below the eye because it is that first branch of the trigeminal ,0
nerve which is the ophthalmic branch which tends to be activated first so people start feeling as if there's a pain behind their eye in particular on one side oftentimes there's lacrimation which is tearing up there can be some nasal discharge another common symptom of this type of headache that is the cluster headache is that the pupil ,0
sometimes will become very small the pupils of the eyes and they won't dilate even in darkness so there are a bunch of things that are going on on one or both sides of the face that seem to arise from deep within the head or it's almost as if it's coming from the brain outward and that's because it's neural in origin Okay so we've got muscular origins of ,0
headaches we've got meningeal origins of headaches that is the the stuff around the brain and as it relates to the vasculature and we have neural origins of headaches and of course there's inflammation origins of headaches now inflammation is a term that gets thrown around a lot these days people are talking about you know this ,0
reduces inflammation inflammation is bad and and I I suppose in some cases and when inflammation is really widespread across the brainer body it's bad but I don't think any of us should think about inflammation per se as bad what I mean is inflammation is just one form of signaling in the body which of course includes the brain ,0
inflammation of a tissue is one way in which a set of cells so these could be for instance uh cells of the immune system and we cover this in a detailed episode all about the immune system if you'd like to check that out you go to hubermanlab.com just put into our search function immune system and you can find that episode by the way all of our ,0
episodes are searchable by keyword hubermanlab.com and it'll take you to specific episodes and time stamps for the topics you're interested in so for sake of this discussion about headache inflammation is going to be the case when one particular tissue in and around the head area is releasing molecules cytokines which sometimes are called ,0
inflammatory cytokines but there are also non-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines but inflammatory molecules that are signaling to the rest of the body hey there's something going on here there's either some intrusive object and indeed if you were to get you know a bb or a splinter into a particular uh you know ,0
skin area there'd be a lot of inflammation so it could be the introduction of a foreign physical object into an area that will cause inflammation it can be the presence of some sort of local toxin in that area it could be a more systemic inflammation nonetheless inflammation in the neck and head area where frankly anywhere within ,0
the sinus area so this would include the mouth the nose around the eyes because the sinuses many of us think of sinuses as just our nose but actually if I were to show you a skull a human skull or any other kind of skull you'd be very hopefully intrigued to learn that the skull is just not one big piece of solid bone or a you know a top ,0
with a jaw below it it actually has all these small what are called fenestrations little holes and canals that run through the skull and through the depth of the skull like little tubes you've got them down here on your mandible you've got them above your lips you have them um on either sides of your nose those are the sinuses the sinuses ,0
allow the passage of different fluids through the skull because the skull even though it's bone it's not a dead tissue right in a live person or animal the skull is a very active living tissue indeed all bone is active living tissue and it needs to be nourished with blood it needs to be nourished with cerebral spinal fluid in ,0
the case of the skull it needs to be nourished with all sorts of important things so those sinuses oftentimes can become clogged as is in the case with sinus headache which we'll talk about in a little bit but more generally anytime there's inflammation of one given area of the body so it could be a shoulder it could be the neck it could be the mouth ,0
it could be the nose or in the case of the headache it could be any portion of the head or neck what happens is inflammation while it's a very efficient signal it's much like the siren on an ambulance or a police car and that it sends out a very broad signal that's very clear something is wrong here and needs to be dealt with ,0
it's not very specific so it's very robust but it's not very specific so for instance if there's a little bacterial infection or a little viral infection the inflammation response to that site of infection tends to be far more widespread than the actual site of infection it's a little bit different when you have a foreign object there ,0
like a splinter or some other foreign object that tends to be a bit more localized and the immune system is always trying to limit the the extent of inflammation by putting in different scar tissues indeed a lot of the things that we think of as kind of gross you know pustules and boils and things like that I know it's a gross topic are ,0
ways in which our body tries to restrict the amount of inflammation but the face area and the head itself are so heavily infused with blood vessels and there's a constant perfusion as we say of blood and cerebral spinal fluid and other things through this incredibly metabolically active tissue that we call our brain and our eyes those are by far ,0
the most metabolically active tissues in our entire body even if we're running hundreds of miles in Ultra marathons your brain is still far more metabolically demanding than all the muscles of your body combined no matter what the conditions because of that there tends to be a generalization or a spreading out of any inflammatory ,0
response and that inflammatory response then can trigger the pain mechanisms or what we've experience as pain mechanisms in the other three types of tissues that we talked about so for instance if you have a systemic infection or you're experiencing inflammation of any kind and it has anything to do with or encroaches on the face or head area that ,0
can easily and almost always spills over into activation of nerve cells can give rise to neural based headache or to the meninges and can give rise to meningeal headaches and of course to the muscles and to muscular type headaches so we've got muscular origins of the ache in headache we have meningeal origins of the achin headache ,0
we have neural origins of the aching headache and we have inflammation-based origins of the ache in headache and that pertains to all the different types of headaches that we're going to talk about and it's important to keep in mind that there are these different sources of the ache and headache and that sometimes they exist alone and sometimes they ,0
exist in combination however this isn't important however all pain or I should say all experience of pain as a perception is going to be neural in origin when we experience pain whether or not it's a pin prick or a cut stub our toe we trip and fall or a headache it is neural in ,0
origin it is the nervous system and nerve cells that are going to carry that signal that we perceive as pain so as we talk about the different sources of pain and different types of headache we will also talk about of course I think what most people are interested in today's discussion the different treatments for the different types of headache and why ,0
each of those different treatments work but by understanding a little bit about how pain arises in the nervous system and certainly by understanding the different types of headaches you know what is a tension headache I gave you some impression that it's running around your head like a headband in many cases versus cluster headache which starts ,0
deep below the eye often it feels as if it's emerging from deep in the brain versus migraine which we'll get into in a moment by understanding the different types of headaches you should be able to quickly pinpoint what type of headache you have what types of tissues are likely involved and therefore what types of treatments are going to most quickly ,0
and most completely relieve that type of headache okay so for the next three to five minutes and I promise no more I'm going to explain how pain arises at the level of nerve cells and I suppose this is one of those times when if I had a highlighter pen that could go out and across the the microphones and speakers leading to your ears ,0
I would use it here because what I'm about to tell you is perhaps one of the most important things to understand about your nervous system that is your brain and you which is that while you have trillions of neurons and we hear that you have trillions and different types of neurons in your brain and they come in different shapes and sizes and ,0
do different things and some make dopamine and some make serotonin and so make glutamate and on and on the key distinction among different types of neurons that is the three types of neurons that I believe everybody scientists are no everybody should understand exist are some neurons nerve cells are what we call motor neurons in ,0
the sense that they control the contraction of muscles sometimes for walking other neurons control the movements of your fingers scientists call those digits other ones your toes they also control the beating of your heart although that's a slightly different ,0
mechanism and slightly different type of tissue than is involved in generating motor movements of your limbs these are neurons that we call motor neurons because their goal or their purpose I should say they don't really know what their their goal or purpose is but what they do is they make sure that muscles contract so that certain things ,0
happen in your body like your heart beats or you move your limbs you lift your eyelids or your eyebrows rather and so on and so forth other types of neurons are what we call Sensory neurons they communicate the same way that motor neurons do that is they fire what we call Action ,0
potentials which are just electrical signals they release neurotransmitters like any other neuron but they respond to certain events in the environment or the environment within the body but they are not responsible for generating muscular contractions so we call these Sensory neurons some Sensory neurons sense light touch other Sensory ,0
neurons sense firm touch other sensory neurons sense pain other Sensory neurons sense light brushing on the skin in fact you have Sensory neurons believe it or not that respond specifically to the light brushing of a hand across your skin any region of your body and if that particular region of your body happens to have hair on it and you stroke the ,0
skin in the direction that the hairs lay down we experience that as pleasurable whereas if you stroke in the direction opposite to the the way the hairs lay down we experience that as not pleasurable so these Sensory neurons respond in some cases for instance within the auditory system they respond ,0
to sound waves and your eye they respond to photons of light sometimes photons of light of particular wavelengths that we think of as red green blue and so on Sensory neurons don't move muscles they respond to things in the environment and they exist within us so we have Sensory neurons that sense for instance pressure within our head or pressure within our ,0
gut how full or empty our gut is pain within our tissues like our liver or or any kind of other internal organ so we've got motor neurons Sensory neurons and then the last kind of neuron is what we call modulatory neurons these are the ones that adjust the relationship between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons to determine ,0
whether or not we do anything in response to a sensory input that is whether or not if a sensory neuron fires sends it electrical potential whether or not it will generate a motor change let me give you a very simple example of this so for those of you listening I'll just explain what I'm doing and for those of you watching you'll be able to ,0
see I'm holding my hand out in front of me if I were to touch the top of my hand with my fingertip I can deliberately override that is I can modulate that more typical reflex which is that when something touches us if we're not aware of where it's coming from we typically move away from that thing that touches ,0
this is a very natural response but we can decide we're not going to move away we can decide to stay still or we can decide to move toward the thing that touches us but typically if you were to walk up to somebody and you were to touch them they'd either turn toward you on the side that you touch them or they'd step away it's rare that they're ,0
going to step into you but you could decide that you were not going to move away or you could step into the direction of touch and that's because you have modulatory neurons that can adjust the conversation in a very context-dependent way as to whether or not the sensory neuron will cause motor neurons to contract or ,0
not okay so we've got motor neuron Sensory neurons and modulatory neurons and you're probably thinking by now why are we talking about this I thought we were talking about headache I thought we're going to talk about treatments for headache but this turns out to be very important because you could imagine and in a moment I'll explain how let's say ,0
you have tension headaches you're somebody that has the classic symptoms of tension headache let me tell you what those are these are headaches again that occur more or less on on the in a kind of a headband like fashion or they tend to start there and exist around that these are very common they can arise from a number of ,0
different sources rise from sleep deprivation they can rise from excessive use of caffeine intake we'll talk about why that is they can arise from stress they can arise from very low level viral infections or bacterial infections but we experience these as just as headaches where you've been thinking too hard or working too hard or life has been ,0
stressful they're often also associated with jaw pain and jaw tightness and neck tightness so tension headaches everything you'd imagine muscular tension could cause well if you want to treat tension headache you can imagine that because all headache is neural that you'd want to go after some sort of neural mechanism to ,0
treat them but of course we now know that there are three types of neurons there are motor neurons Sensory neurons and modulatory neurons so we have choices we can say okay do we want to turn off the muscles in the head jaw and neck that are hyper contracted for instance you want to take a muscle relaxer or relaxedant ,0
or would you want to try and change the sensory input itself maybe don't change the way the muscles are behaving but shut off the sensory part of it your ability to sense it there are certainly ways you can do that or would you want to adjust the modulatory neurons would you want to make it such that you have the headache ,0
but you don't perceive the headache that is you cut off communication between the sensor and the motor so that the muscles relax turns out there are treatments and approaches for each and every one of those each and every one of those has different advantages and disadvantages but as you can quickly see we are going to have different types of headaches and ,0
different approaches to treating headache but if you keep in the back of your mind that you have neurons that contract muscles to create movement or tension of muscles remember you can turn off those neurons and allow those muscles to relax you have Sensory neurons that sense input and actually sense the pain and you have modulatory ,0
neurons which can allow you to adjust the relationship between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons and of course some of you are probably screaming at me by now saying wait why would you ever want to deal with the motor neurons or or the modulatory neurons once you want to just go straight to the source and just cut off ,0
the pain ah well the problem there is that many painkillers have other issues as well in particular they can be sedative many of them can be habit forming or even addictive and for many people not all but many people they don't want to take drugs whether or not they're over-the-counter or prescription drugs or even more natural supplement ,0
based type treatments and they would rather use for instance a behavioral approach in which they can modulate they can deliberately turn off the communication between Sensory neurons and motor neurons and turns out those approaches exist as well okay so at this point I promise you that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology ,0
lesson in terms of pain sensing and headaches as a more uh conceptual phenomenon instead what I'd like to do next is talk about the different types of headaches and I think this is something that's very important and not often discussed except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of ,0
headaches like migraine or cluster or tension headache but I think for most people out there who experience headache and again that is everybody at some point experiences headache rather than just think of headache as one thing understanding the major types of headache and how they differ from and are similar to one another will really ,0
help you identify what the best source of treatments for those are so I'd like to talk about what the different types of headache are now the first type of headache we're going to discuss is the tension type headache again tension type headaches tend to start off not always but tend to start off as more or less a Halo or a headband around the forehead ,0
in the area above the eyes often also include the jaw the neck muscles and can extend even into the upper back again this can be caused by some low level of infection but more often than not tension type headaches are going to come on because of some chronic psychological stress usually combined with lack of sleep usually combined with ,0
lifestyle issues and of course without getting into a long discussion about it anytime you have lack of sleep you're going to have excessive stress anytime you have excessive stress you're going to have to make sure you're offsetting that by getting proper sleep most people don't when they're under excessive stress by the way we have excellent ,0
tools we're grounded in excellent science available to you at zero cost if you are experienced chronic stress or even short-term stress we have a master stress episode of the human Lab podcast again just go to hubermanlab.com and all that's time stamped for you tension type headaches begin in a more or less a headband ,0
pattern but can really extend to other tissues as well not so often in the face but really the head and often will start to climb up toward the top of the head they are not always in this Halo pattern sometimes they can be localized to one area such as the you know the back of the head or the front of the head or one side of the head more than others and ,0
that's often the case because of tension within muscles of the neck that tend to bias the ache towards one side of the head I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking ,0
athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with ,0
the brain in the immune system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health and those probiotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for microbiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptogens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all of ,0
my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes great if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you're on the road in the car on the plane Etc and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2 ,0
again that's athleticgreens.com huberman to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3 K2 the other type of headache that unfortunately is very common is migraine headaches migraine headaches are defined generally as disorders of recurring attacks of headaches so people who get migraines often get them in a recurring ,0
fashion some people get them very often other people get them less often but migraines are very debilitating the numbers that is the prevalence of migraine is still pretty debated one thing that we know for sure is that females suffer from migraine headaches at a rate at least threefold higher than do males and surprisingly this does not ,0
seem to have any direct hormonal origin because we're also going to talk about hormonal headaches that is headaches that relate to a dip in estrogen and progesterone a particular phase of the menstrual cycle that is the ovulatory cycle so there's a bit of a mystery here and the Mystery is why is it that migraine headaches occur at such greater ,0
frequency in females even independently of the menstrual cycle so when you control for changes in hormones that still appears to be the case and overall migraines are very common now the numbers on migraine and just how common migraine is are extremely wide this was a little bit frustrating for me in researching this ,0
episode you will find for instance that 17 of women suffer from migraines you will also hear that six percent of males suffer from migraines you will also hear that 43 43 percent of females suffer from migraine that is recurring headaches that qualify as migraine headaches and that ,0
17 percent of men suffer from migraine headaches on a recurring basis which is again the definition of a migraine headache or one of the key definitions so all we can say for sure is that many many millions of people maybe even billions of people suffer from migraine headaches it's kind of a staggering thing to contemplate but we know it's ,0
extremely common and we know that it's more prevalent in females in any of the studies that you will find in terms of that compare the overall prevalence of headache it's going to be higher substantially higher in females and males does not seem to be related to the ovulatory menstrual cycle there are some interesting facts related ,0
to that that I'll just you know touch on for a moment pregnancy for whatever reason seems to be protective against migraine headaches that is women who suffer from recurring migraines before they get pregnant when they get pregnant and often after they give birth they experience fewer migraine headaches ,0
so there may be something hormonal it may be something else what do we know for sure we know that headache that is the ache in headache is neural so whether or not the origins are hormonal or whether or not the origins are inflammation or gut microbiome or some other feature of the body brain axis at this point all we know is that ,0
neural pain or the experience of pain at the neural level is the final common pathway and it's more prevalent in females so as I mentioned migraines tend to be recurring so some people get them once a week some people get them once a month some people get them far more frequently that they can be extremely debilitating oftentimes people ,0
experience migraine because it is a recurring phenomenon will know when a migraine is coming on they'll say my migraine is coming on the kind of sense it coming there's this notion of Aura and we'll talk about Aura in a little bit some people think of Aura just as visual aura or the sense of kind of a haloing of ,0
light with the sense that there's something outside the body the actual definition of Aura is that it's the experience that something is about to happen it's this kind of feeling of anticipation it's not deja vu deja vu is different and very interesting in its own right but different it's this feeling that ,0
something's about to happen and the fact that aura is such a prominent feature of migraine headaches or at least that people feel that the headache is coming on long before they feel the actual ache of the headache and the other debilitating symptoms suggests that migraine has something of deep neural origin that it arises from deep within ,0
the nervous system spinal cord and brain and that it's not something like a tension headache that is going from outside in you know the constriction of the muscles in the jaw and head so migraine headaches are very different than tension headaches even in terms of how they come on or their onset the other feature of migraine headaches that ,0
I think is important to note is that dilation of the vessels remember the vasodilation so the widening of those pipes that we call arteries vessels and capillaries is a very prominent feature of migraine and fortunately that allows for very particular types of treatment and ways of dealing with this pain specific to migraine headaches the other ,0
feature that's common in migraine headaches is so-called photophobia many of you are probably familiar with photophobia if you've ever been sleep deprived simply if you're sleep deprived and you go outside in the morning the light is going to seem very very bright much brighter than were you to have had ,0
a really good night's sleep and that's because during sleep there are all sorts of reset mechanisms in the brain there's the washing out of metabolic debris and things in the brain the so-called lymphatic washout That's essential there's also an adjustment of the neural tissue of the eyes which as many of you have heard me say before actually two ,0
pieces of rain that have been extruded from the cranial Vault so your eyes yes indeed are two pieces of brain the only two pieces of brain outside the cranial Vault and within your eyes you have neurons and mechanisms that adjust the the sort of sensitivity of your eyes to light and of your brain to light and when you are sleep deprived or when you ,0
have a low-level viral infection or a cold or a flu of any kind you tend to experience light as brighter than it actually is when you're rested or you're in the healthy state so photophobia is something that's very very common in migraine and often the photophobia is a prominent feature of the experience that a migraine is coming ,0
on people will start saying oh you know it's just too bright in here and normally they'd be able to tolerate that level of sunlight or of indoor lighting with no problem so there are two aspects of migraine that I think are particularly important to understand for sake of of the treatment ,0
and that's the dilation of vessels so we if we want to treat migraine we're going to have to think about things that can constrict blood vessels in the brain area but we also need to think about photophobia not photophobia just as a symptom of migraine but that maybe by adjusting our sensitivity to light we can actually short-circuit some of the ,0
onset and subsequent pathology of the migraine that is if we can prevent photophobia partially or completely can actually offset a lot of the ache of the migraine that would otherwise occur so that's an exciting Avenue for addressing migraine headaches we'll get into photophobia and how to deal with that we'll also talk ,0
about Aura a little bit more in a few minutes but for the time being we've talked about tension headaches we've now talked about migraine headaches again keep in mind knowing what kind of headache you have is essential it's I would say indispensable for selecting the best treatment many people out there will simply get a headache and decide oh ,0
I'm going to pop a couple of aspirin okay what does aspirin do aspirin's and anti-inflammatory it also has pronounced effects on the vasodilation and vasoconstriction system it actually allows more blood to flow through those arteries vessels and capillaries a lot of people actually use baby aspirin or small amounts of aspirin as a way to ,0
offset cardiovascular disease that's another discussion but what do we know we know that in migraine there's a hyper dilation of the blood vessels a hyper dilation of the very little portals that exist in the brain and around the brain and that are going to cause the pain you're going to activate those Sensory neurons those non-iceceptors that will ,0
then give us the experience of extreme headache and migraine so taking an aspirin or something like it for migraine in some cases the worst possible Choice again so knowing what kind of headache you are experiencing is going to be essential here the other thing that you'll sometimes hear is that drinking a cup of coffee or getting ,0
caffeine through tea is a great way to deal with headache why would that be well it turns out that coffee can cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation depending on when you take it and we'll get into the use of caffeine as a treatment for headache because indeed it can be a very potent treatment for headache but you ,0
absolutely need to know what kind of headache you are experiencing because in some cases drinking caffeine whether it's in tea or coffee can absolutely alleviate the pain of a headache especially if you catch that onset of a migraine or attention type headache early on but in some cases it can make it far far worse again knowing which ,0
type of headache you're experiencing and how the different treatments work is key okay so we have tension type headaches migraine type headaches I think you're starting to get the picture they have different underlying biologies the next type of headache is cluster headaches cluster headaches are the ones I mentioned earlier that arise from deep ,0
within the head they feel as if they're coming from the inside out and they tend to be on one side or the other what scientists and clinicians call unilateral and tends to originate behind the eye and sometimes the nose region sometimes in the mouth region as well it feels kind of patchy but as if it's coming from the inside out and again ,0
that's because of that trigeminal nerve for those of you listening and not watching this on YouTube I've got three fingers as if I'm putting up three fingers and I'm I've got one pointed toward my eye one pointed towards my nose region and one towards my upper lip the trigeminal nerve is an easy one to remember and it will completely explain ,0
cluster headaches and what to do about cluster headaches in a moment if you remember that the herpes one virus and not herpes two not genital herpes but herpes one virus is the one that gives cold sores on the mouth herpes one virus by the way is exceedingly common up to 90 percent of people many children in fact have these ,0
again this is not a sexually transmitted herpes although it can be of course transmitted through kissing and sexual contact but that's not the only origin of it okay it can be passed by skin contact and mucosal contact um so mucosomucosal so that would be kissing mucosa lying or even skin to mucosal Linings that's why it's so ,0
common and the reason why cold sores develop on the mouth for people that have herpes one is because the virus actually lives on the trigeminal nerve and yes it is true that sometimes the virus will inflame the nerve and the inflammation will occur at the level of the eye so people do unfortunately sometimes get herpes of the eye it ,0
actually can be quite dangerous if you have an infection of the eye of a herpes infection in the eye you should see an ophthalmologist or the nose region they can experience pain in the mucosal tissue of the nose more often than not the most inflammation is occurring on the the branch that innervates the lip or the region close to the lip and ,0
that's why a cold sword develops there an immune response there signaling that there's inflammation due to the herpes virus which lives on that neuron for a very long time neurons don't turn over in the lifespan so it can live on there for the extent of of the person's life however most people hopefully treat their HSV-1 but if they ,0
don't the the sort of frequency and the severity of infections tends to taper off with time we'll have an entire discussion about viruses and herpes in particular in a future episode but the thing to keep in mind here is that this very nerve is the one that gets inflamed in these cluster type headaches now cluster type headaches are associated ,0
with a bunch of very uncomfortable symptoms again they tend to be unilateral they tend to begin very deep and they tend to be excruciatingly painful excruciatingly painful they can last anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours some people experience these in sleep in fact this is one of the cases where men experience a headache more ,0
than females men experience cluster type headaches that have a sudden onset during sleep at five times the frequency than do females the origins of that aren't exactly clear they do seem to have something to do with the biological clock mechanisms the so-called circadian mechanisms so if you are a man or woman for that matter and ,0
you're waking up in the middle of the night with a unilateral headache and it seems like it's deep within your um within your head or it's starting there and it's on one side and localized to the eye and maybe these other regions the trigeminal is involved in you may be suffering from cluster type headache and you should talk to your physician the ,0
other symptom that's quite common in cluster type headache is a droopy eyelid which should make sense because the trigeminal innervates the eye region and there are other nerves that control the eyelid but they're in that General region and they can be impacted the other thing is something called meiosis which is that you can't dilate the pupil ,0
I mentioned this before so those your pupils might get really really small and they won't dilate and the other thing is lacrimation tearing and then nasal discharge all because of a neural inflammation problem why do I tell you with such detail about cluster headaches well if you are somebody that's experiencing the kind of pain that is ,0
consistent with cluster headache taking a standard anti-inflammatory or doing something that is going to adjust the vial the excuse me the dilation or constriction of blood vessels may have an indirect impact on cluster headache but is unlikely to relieve cluster headache either acutely meaning right away or in preventing cluster headaches ,0
you have to deal with this as a neural issue and we'll talk about some of the main causes of inflammation and activation of these cluster type headaches at the level of the trigeminal nerve in a little bit because fortunately there are some excellent treatments the next type of headache that is quite common are hormonal ,0
headaches now the phrase hormonal headache should already cue you to the fact that it's far too General a term because there's so many different hormones testosterone estrogen thyroid hormone growth hormone and on and on and on and they all have many different functions in the brain and body every ,0
single hormone and in particular the so-called steroid hormones steroids again not just limited to things that people take for Sports in fact the steroid hormones refers to estrogen testosterone of the sort that we all make that men and women make naturally and those steroid hormones can impact gene expression they ,0
can are of course what turns on the growth of the of the breast tissue of the testicular tissue of the hair growth and on and on and that's all because of gene expression if you're really going to change the identity and function of a cell long term right you're going to literally change the breast tissue or change the penile ,0
tissue or change the ovarian tissue in some sort of consistent way across the lifespan you can bet that there are changes in gene expression and those changes in gene expression occur because these steroid hormones have this incredible ability sort of like the X-Men of hormones to pass through the outer membrane of a cell which we call ,0
the extracellular membrane and into the so-called nuclear membrane they can go into the area where genes are made and turn on and off different genes however they multitask in their life that is these steroid hormones like estrogen in particular and testosterone in particular can also bind to the surface of cells and impact all sorts of things ,0
at the level of the cells that have nothing to do with changes in gene expression and that second mechanism of binding to the surface of cells is one of the ways in which estrogen can control different aspects of headache now that doesn't necessarily mean the estrogen gives you headaches in fact it's just ,0
the opposite it turns out that low estrogen and another hormone low progesterone combine to give rise to headache because of the ways that low estrogen and low progesterone impact vasodilation and vasoconstriction and the inflammatory response we'll talk about how to deal with hormone-based headaches ,0
a particular hormone was headaches that occur because of low estrogen and progesterone in a moment but the key thing to know is something that we covered in the fertility episode I did a very long very detailed episode on fertility so I'm not going going to go into this in significant detail now you can refer to that episode for probably ,0
more detail than you ever wanted but also a lot of tools as it relates to fertility in both males and females but right now I'm just going to give you a course overview of that in about 60 to 120 seconds so that you'll understand when hormonal headaches are most likely to take place keep in mind that hormonal headaches are most likely to take place ,0
when estrogen and progesterone are lowest so if you understand that during the follicular stage of the ovulatory slash menstrual cycle okay so menstrual cycle is about 28 days on average not in everyone but it's about 20 days on average and the first half of that estrogen starts creeping up up up up up ,0
up up up up up and as we learn in endocrinology estrogen primes progesterone so estrogen will then Peak and then start to fall pretty quickly right about the time that the egg ovulates an egg is released and will essentially be ready for fertilization if the egg is fertilized a whole bunch of other things happen as it ,0
relates to pregnancy if not what ends up happening is that during the ludial phase which is the second half of the menstrual cycle there's been a buildup of the lining of the uterus because of an increase in progesterone so estrogen goes up during the follicular phase then it goes down and then progesterone goes up up up up up ,0
which is important for generating that thick lining of the uterus to allow the fertilized egg if it's fertilized to implant and if it's not fertilized all of that gets released from the body in this bleeding process that we call menstruation if menstruation occurs and day one of the menstrual cycle is considered the first day in which ,0
bleeding occurs well then what that means is that estrogen is already low because remember estrogen was low at the start of the follicular phase and went up up up up up up then it comes down right at the time of ovulation and progesterone goes up up up up up during the luteal phase in fact it's more than a thousand fold increase in progesterone ,0
but if there's no fertilization of the egg progesterone starts coming down down down down down what does that mean that means that on the first to about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle first being the first day of bleeding until about the fourth or fifth day of the menstrual cycle both estrogen and progesterone are very very low and ,0
it is at that time at the very beginning of the menstrual cycle so about the first week of the menstrual cycle that many women are very prone to hormonal headaches hormonal headaches not because estrogens High that's a common misconception rather because estrogen and progesterone are both low and now that you understand the Contour or the ,0
under underlying reasons for hormonal headache you can start to ask well what happens when estrogen is low well estrogen has a strong impact on the vasodilation vasoconstriction system as does progesterone we'll talk about that a little bit later but now that you know what hormonal headache is at least this ,0
one particular type of hormonal headache which is very very common given the number of women that are menstruating and the fact that low estrogen low progesterone is the cause of the hormonal headache and the fact that of course there are women who are no longer menstruating so they're either in perimenopause and menstruation is ,0
becoming more infrequent or they're in menopause and it deceased entirely well now you understand what the origin of the hormonal headache is and so all we need to know is what do estrogen and progesterone normally do in order to prevent headache and thereby you'll know exactly how to offset that is prevent or treat hormonal headache in that first ,0
week of the menstrual period the last type of headache that I'd like to discuss is headache associated with head hits that is traumatic brain injury although I definitely want to underscore the fact that even people who do not have traumatic brain injury can experience headaches as the consequence of hitting their head so the line ,0
between traumatic brain injury and lower level brain injury is one that still seeks definition in fact this is one of the major goals of the clinical field as it relates to concussion you know it's also what comes up a lot during the discussion about football you know these days you'll see players hit really hard and depending on whether or not they're ,0
laying there for five seconds 30 seconds or three minutes you know the crowd and the uh the people watching on television and everywhere else are all speculating as to whether or not the person should be allowed to play and to be quite direct there really is no way to assess the extent of brain damage after the consequence of hitting one's head or ,0
having one's head hit because first of all almost all of the best ways to detect traumatic brain injury except the most severe ones tend to require a lot of very large equipment like MRI and functional MRI and CT scans none of which are available on the side of the field or in the ,0
locker room but also because many many if not most of the effects of traumatic brain injury are going to occur not in the immediate minutes or even hours after the injury but several hours days or even weeks after that injury this is a discussion that we should hold off for a longer full episode on traumatic brain injury keeping in mind of course that ,0
football is this very Salient example of traumatic brain injury and concussion as is boxing as is even soccer with heading of the ball Believe It or Not repeated low level impact to the forehead and other parts of the head can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion or being quote ,0
unquote knocked out but sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion most traumatic brain injury and concussion and low-level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living that is lowered cognition disruption and mood ,0
sleep Etc is actually the consequence of things other than Sports so for instance bicycle accidents playground accidents construction accidents and this is often forgotten for some reason all the sports in particular football tend to grab all the attention as it relates to concussion keep in mind that while for ,0
certain people is a path to a living for most people traumatic brain injury is going to occur in a car accident construction work or other types of work for which people generally don't have many options in terms of the type of work that they're doing so they are prone to concussions and head injuries simply by virtue of their work without ,0
any you know millions of dollars contracts or the opportunities necessarily some cases they do but necessarily to do other things and certainly car accidents or bike bicycle accidents are not voluntary events so the point being traumatic brain injury and headache related traumatic brain injury extends far beyond the realm of ,0
sports and in fact if you were to look at the numbers what you find is that more than 90 percent of traumatic brain injury so people coming into the hospital or clinic are people claiming that they've got consistent headaches they're not sleeping well their mood is off they're feeling more irritable after having hit their head even once ,0
is not the consequence of sports it's going to be the consequence of accidents either on at the workplace or in terms of a bicycle or other sorts of Transportation based accident like a car accident with that in mind any kind of head hit certainly involves a concussion or traumatic brain injury often leads to headaches either infrequent but severe ,0
headaches or chronic low-level headaches or a feeling there's kind of a stuffiness or a fullness to the head there can be a lot of different Origins to that a common origin is going to be actual swelling of the not necessarily the brain tissue directly but if you recall our discussion about the meninges which ,0
include the dura and the other tissues that surround the brain they're actually three layers that we call the meninges the durages being one of them and there's a very little space between those the brain the meninges that surround it and the skull it's called the subarachnoid space very cool right arachnoid like spider ,0
well if there's even a slight bit of swelling in the brain or even distant brain tissue so for instance even if the there's Whiplash so there's swelling of the tissue muscular tissue and neural tissue in the neck area that can constrict the flow of things like cerebral spinal fluid blood flow and indeed mucus and other other things that ,0
are essential we all hear mucus and we think Illness but mucus is a vital vital substance within the body for a lot of important reasons in health as well as in sickness well if there's less of that liquid and other fluids and mucus being delivered to that space well then it can clog up so sort of the plumbing is clogged up or that it's caught at the ,0
level of the site of hit or injury because there's some local swelling and inflammation there so there are many different mechanisms that can underlie headache associated with head hits or traumatic brain injury now fortunately there are some recent data pointing to some what I would call non-obvious treatments for headache in traumatic ,0
brain injury keeping in mind that anytime we're talking about injury or disease or health for that matter mental health or physical health we have to highlight a fact that's going to come up again and again in every single episode of this podcast and I think it's not being overly redundant to do so which is that ,0
regular sufficient amounts of deep sleep each night are going to be important for all aspects of mental health physical health and performance and have been shown over and over again to reduce the frequency of headache and to reduce the time to repair after traumatic brain injury and can improve cognition and on and on and ,0
on so sleep is essential for all the normal things that encourage healthy activity of the different tissues that are involved in brain and body to occur so sleep deprivation of course is going to limit those but I do want to point out that sleep sunlight and I've talked about this almost ad nauseam on this podcast but ,0
regular circadian Cycles getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and in the evening as well and as much as possible throughout the day without burning your skin and limiting your exposure to artificial lights at night and on and on all of which is covered in the light for health episode of The huberman Lab podcast the master sleep ,0
episode The huberman Lab podcast and in the perfect your sleep episode The huberman Lab podcast you can find all that at hubermanlab.com getting light and avoiding light at the proper times of the 24 hour cycle is also going to favor all the pathways ranging from gut brain access to the inflammatory anti-inflammatory Pathways neural ,0
Pathways Etc that of course if you do that you're going to improve and offset any kind of detriment caused by traumatic brain injury is it treating traumatic brain injury directly no but is not getting sufficient sleep not getting sunlight at the right times of day and getting too much artificial light at night going to make any impact ,0
of traumatic brain injury including headache far worse yes there are certainly a ton of data to support that state statement as well and then of course nutrition and exercise are also important so we can list out sleep Sun proper nutrition exercise and I would put a proper social connection whatever that means to you healthy social ,0
connections include romantic friendship familial and relationship to self those five things sleep exercise Sun nutrition and social connection are all critical for maintaining baselines of health and raising your baselines of health and I mentioned that I can segment this out now because I think that anytime we're about to start ,0
discussing pointed treatments that is things that you can take or do to reduce headache or things that you can take or do to improve anything within mental health physical health and performance we have to remember that the foundation of mental health physical health and performance is only set at its highest level by tending to those other things ,0
and that nothing really surpasses any of those things or put differently there's no replacement for any of those things in the form of a pill a powder even a behavioral practice there are things you can do to offset getting less than ideal sleep the things that you can use like bright artificial lights during the day to try and partially offset lack of ,0
sunlight but really there is no exercise pill there is no sunlight device although some bright lights are very bright there's no no replace basement for actual sunlight there's no replacement for actual sleep there's no replacement for actual nutrition and I do feel it's an important conversation to have as we head into the next segment ,0
which is what can you take or do to reduce headache and in order to address this we're going to start first with the headaches associated with head hits and traumatic brain injury because turns out there's a surprising and very useful approach to doing that but this same approach also can help offset and treat headache in other conditions ,0
as well meaning not just for headaches caused by traumatic brain injury but also headaches caused by sudden onset Tension Headache or migraine headache or even perhaps again perhaps cluster type headaches so the first substance that I'd like to highlight that has been shown to significantly reduce the intensity and or frequency of headaches ,0
is creatine now creatine as many of you know is something that people supplement and take most often creatine is discussed in the context of muscle performance not just for people who weightlift but for people who do endurance exercise and it's often been said that 5 to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate depending on how ,0
much you weigh 5 to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate can increase creatine phosphate stores in muscles can bring more water into muscles can make you stronger get increased power output and that is all true that is all completely true we discussed this in the huberman lab podcast with Dr Andy Galpin when he was a guest on the Hebrew and ,0
Lab podcast or standard series and we discussed this extensively in an upcoming episode from Dr Andy Galpin in his special six-part guest Series where he is a guest on the Hebrew Lab podcast but where really he's the one doing the majority of the teaching that series covers everything from strength ,0
hypertrophy endurance and there's an episode on supplementation where we go deep into the discussion about creatine now in that discussion and again now we highlight the fact that creatine While most often discussed online and in the media as a supplement for sports performance for the reasons I just mentioned ,0
actually has far more data behind it that is laboratory studies exploring the role of creatine in the clinical setting so I'd like to highlight a paper from that literature now that will make very clear as to why creatine is interesting and in fact very effective for treating headache and particular headache caused by head hits or traumatic brain injury ,0
the title of the paper is prevention of traumatic headache dizziness and fatigue with creatine Administration now keep in mind this is a pilot study it was performed in humans so when you hear the words pre-clinical that is if you hear there was a pre-clinical study on blank that means almost always that the study was performed on animal models mice rats ,0
primates Etc a clinical trial is something that's carried out on humans and a pilot study means that the study was carried out on humans but on a fairly small cohort a very fairly small group uh or limited number of subjects nonetheless if the data are robust as it is in this case of this paper I think it's worth paying ,0
attention to so in this study what they looked at was creatine Administration so what they did is they had people ingest a certain amount of creatine I'll tell you in a moment in fluid so it could be taken in water milk with or without food doesn't really matter what time of day they had people take creatine why would ,0
they have people take creatine after traumatic brain injury and in particular for people that are suffering from headache dizziness fatigue Etc the reason is that neurons nerve cells rely very heavily on the regulation of calcium in order to generate those Action potentials to communicate with one another so it ,0
doesn't matter if it's a motor neuron a sensory neuron or a modulatory neuron they all generate Action potentials or something similar to it and calcium is important for that process calcium becomes dysregulated after traumatic brain injury in a number of different ways in particular in ways that impact the ,0
energy production systems of cells that are related to ATP adenosine triphosphate for those facionados out there that want to look it up you can simply look up calcium ATP and neurons and you can learn about that cycle creatine can be stored in muscles as we talked about before but creatine and in ,0
particular the phosphorylated form of creatine which is the readily available fuel source form of creatine can also be stored in brain tissue and is actually quite prominently stored in the forebrain the area where the real estate of of your brain just behind the forehead which is involved in planning and action and ,0
understanding context so it's very important for cognition it's important for personality too but it's important for a number of different aspects of life that have to do with making plans being able to focus very intensely on your work etc or on anything for that matter all functions that become heavily disrupted in people ,0
who have traumatic brain injury and concussion creatine's ability to communicate with the calcium in the ATP system was the motivation behind the study that is the authors hypothesize on the basis of pre-clinical data in animals that by increasing creatine stores within the brain not just in the muscle ,0
but in particular within the brain that the availability of creatine would allow for better cognitive function in general now they didn't look at cognition specifically in this paper but they did look at the other aspects that is that the bad stuff associated with TBI and they had people supplement with creatine ,0
at a level that is much higher than the typical level that people supplement with creatine Simply for Sports Performance so as I mentioned before most people if they supplement with creatine for sports performance they take creatine monohydrate typically five grams per day sometimes 10 grams per day if they're about 100 ,0
kilograms or or greater in body weight 100 kilograms is 200 approximately 220. pounds so the dosage that was used for supplementing creatine in this study to address the potential impact of creatine on headache dizziness and fatigue was quite a bit higher than the dosages used simply for muscle performance in this study they had ,0
people take a dose of 0.4 grams of creatine monohydrate per kilogram of body weight so for somebody that weighs 100 kilograms or 220 pounds that would be 40 grams of creatine per day if someone weighs half that much they would take 20 grams of creatine per day and they did that over a period of six months and we know that when you take ,0
creatine over and over day to day that there's a buildup of creatine stores both in the muscles and within the brain tissue now what they found as a consequence of this creatine Administration was really striking and I think quite exciting they found a very significant decrease in the frequency of headache in people that were ,0
supplementing with creatine as opposed to the controls now keep in mind that this is a pilot study but the effects are very dramatic they found a very statistically significant decrease increase in the frequency of headache in people that were taking creatine in fact if you look at the controls and you see that they're basically getting headache ,0
at a frequency of 90 percent or more after TBI the reduction in headache frequency is down to about 10 or 12 percent in the people taking creatine so that's quite quite a dramatic effect and if you look at the other measures they took keep in mind again this is a pilot study so a limited number of subjects but ,0
again the results are very impressive what they found is that the number of people experiencing dizziness was significantly reduced in people supplementing with creatine as was the number of people experiencing fatigue and acute fatigue and chronic fatigue again not chronic fatigue syndrome per se but chronic fatigue which was in this ,0
study defined as a general sense of bodily weakness and even mental weakness mental weakness is a little bit hard to quantify but they were very careful to distinguish between cognitive and mental fatigue versus physical and somatic fatigue they acknowledge that both of those occur in TBI or post-tbi the headache is quite frequent basically the ,0
takeaway of the study is that for people experiencing headache dizziness and fatigue due to TBI and perhaps and I want to underline perhaps because it hasn't really been explored yet but perhaps headache dizziness and fatigue due to other conditions symptoms or causes of headache creatine ,0
monohydrate supplementation might be again might be an excellent candidate for people to try why do we say that well first of all creatine monohydrate is relatively inexpensive it's considered safe at the dosages used in this study and certainly for sports performance as well and there are very few other compounds that ,0
have been shown to have as significant an impact on headache over the long term as has creatine monohydrate in these studies of people with TBI it's also important to highlight the fact that many many people suffer from tbis I mentioned earlier and as now there are very few treatments for TBI you tend to get the basic advice coming back and ,0
again I think it's excellent advice you know get proper amounts of sleep get exercise but don't get another traumatic brain injury that's obvious but you'd be surprised how many people go right back to work because they have to and you know we have to be sympathetic to the fact that many people just can't stop working or go on disability ,0
so many people have to go back to work that could be sport or it could be other kind of work where they are then subject to perhaps getting more TBI maybe they're getting less rest as a consequence and stress obviously stress is a confounding issue for TBI but sleep exercise Sun nutrition all of those things proper social ,0
connection are what people are encouraged to do when they have TBI but there have been very few compounds in particular very few over-the-counter compounds that are known to be safe that have shown efficacy in dealing with TBI so I think that while this is a pilot study and we can consider it preliminary I think it's important enough and the ,0
effects were dramatic enough that people with headache and in particular people with TBI ought to consider supplementing with creatine in order to deal with their headaches and of course I eagerly await other studies exploring the role of this high dosage of creatine which is a relatively high dosage of creatine monohydrate for offsetting headache ,0
meanwhile I think there are a number of people out there suffering from headache who might consider using creatine monohydrate in an exploratory fashion and seeing whether or not it helps offset their headaches keep in mind of course anytime you're going to add or remove anything supplement or otherwise from your from ,0
your treatment your nutrition Etc I do suggest that you consult with your physician in particular if you have chronic headaches I don't say that to protect me I say that of course to protect you I'd like to take a brief break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data ,0
for people who weightlift but for people who do endurance exercise and it's often been said that 5 to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate depending on how much you weigh 5 to 10 grams per day of creatine monohydrate can increase creatine phosphate stores in muscles can bring more water into muscles can make you stronger get increased power output ,1
someone weighs half that much they would take 20 grams of creatine per day and they did that over a period of six months and we know that when you take creatine over and over day to day that there's a buildup of creatine stores both in the muscles and within the brain tissue now what they found as a consequence of this creatine ,1

didn't write the paper dietary alteration of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for headache reductions in adults with migraine and this was a randomized control trial randomized control trials involve having people be in one condition where they do one thing and then they get swapped randomly into ,1
another condition so they serve as their own internal control and that controls for all sorts of things like differences in sex differences in age differences in health background in any number of other variables as best as one can in this study they had people either ingest a diet that had increased Omega-3s so increased EPA and DHA or ,1
omega-3 fatty acids the fact that they are available over the counter in a supplement or by liquid or available in food for that matter leads many people to conclude that oh you know this is supplementation this is something that um you know it's going to have relatively weak or minor impact on ,1
things like headache or other health metrics but let's just say that the fact that it exists as a prescription drug and its highest potency form at least in my opinion points to the potency of omega-3 fatty acids in dealing with analgesic effects that is reducing pain and anti-inflammation as well as some of the known cardiovascular improvements ,1

from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term Health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test the problem with a lot of blood and DNA ,0
tests out there however is that you get data back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and so forth but you don't know what to do with those data inside tracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional behavioral maybe even supplementation based interventions you might want to ,0
take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors hormones lipids and other things that impact your immediate and long-term Health to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you inside tracker's ultimate plan also now includes a measure of April lipoprotein b apolipoprotein b sometimes also called ,0

Longevity if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit insidetracker.com huberman and get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off what I'd like to discuss next I find extremely exciting why well what I'm about to describe is a compound or I should say a set of compounds that are ,0
available over the counter that have been shown to be very effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches and not just one kind of headache but multiple types of headaches so what I'll describe has been shown to have significant effects in reducing the intensity or frequency of tension type headaches migraine type headaches as ,0
well as hormone type headaches that are related to the menstrual cycles that I described earlier now there are a lot of data centered around this General topic but I'm going to focus on three main papers but I haven't told you yet of course is what is the compound that I'm referring to what is this over-the-counter compound well it turns ,0
out this over-the-counter compound is not just available over the counter it's also available in food so it turns out that nutrition can have a very strong impact on the frequency and intensity of headache although supplementation with this particular compound can accomplish the same thing as well what I'm referring to here are omega-3 fatty ,0
acids many of you are probably familiar with omega-3 fatty acids these are fatty acids that come in the form of so-called EPA and DHA and omega-3 fatty acids are commonly distinguished from the so-called omega-6 fatty acids omega-6 fatty acids come in a bunch of different foods and they of course can be supplemented as well omega-3 fatty acids ,0
come in a bunch of different foods and can be supplemented as well Common forms of omega-3 fatty acids or I should say common sources of omega-3 fatty acids in Foods include fatty ocean fish including salmon salmon skins sardines anchovies things of that sort common sources in supplement form are so-called fish oil ,0
capsules or liquid fish oil again omega-3 fatty acids and almost always when we're talking about omega-3 fatty acids we're talking about a combination of EPA and DHA but really it is the quantity of EPA omega-3 fatty acids that seems to be the most impactful for the sorts of Health metrics that we're going to talk about ,0
in a few minutes now with respect to omega-6 fatty acids the most typical food sources of omega-6 fatty acids are seed oils I know nowadays seed oils have become quite controversial I've given my stance on this in a prior podcast but I'll just repeat it for those of you that haven't heard it I am ,0
not of the belief that all seed oils are bad that they're all inflammatory that they are killing us or making us sick that they are the major cause of metabolic dysfunction Etc however I think it is very clear and I learned this from Dr Lane Norton when he was a guest on this podcast and taught us all about nutrition in great depth I highly ,0
recommend that episode if you're interested in nutrition that people are consuming a lot more oil generally and a lot of those oils that people are consuming more of nowadays include a lot of the so-called omega-6 fatty acids and a lot of those oils are seed oils the particular omega-6 fatty acid that's going to be relevant for today's ,0
discussion is linoleic acid and that is common in a lot of seed oils so again I'm not going to tell you that seed oils are bad however it does seem to be the case that many people are consuming far too many seed oils and in doing so are consuming far too many calories and perhaps are consuming too much of the Omega six fatty acids relative to the ,0
omega-3 fatty acids now with that said I think there is General agreement among nutritionists and health professionals that we could all stand to get more omega-3 fatty acids perhaps for cardiovascular health although that's a little bit debated but certainly for immune system function for mood and for functioning of the ,0
brain and for the potent anti-inflammatory effects of Omega-3 so again Omega-3s can be sourced from food both animal based and plant-based you can simply go online and look up the various food-based sources but in thinking about headache and different treatments for headache there are some recent studies exploring how ,0
supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids and in one case how supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids and deliberately reducing the amount of linoleic acid the omega-6 fatty acids how that can impact headache so the first study I'd like to describe in reference to the role of omega-3 fatty acids and headache was published in 2018 and the title of the ,0
paper is long chain omega-3 fatty acids and headache in the U.S population there are a number of things that I really like about this study a few of those include the fact that they looked at an enormous number of people that is they included 12 317 men and women I like the fact that they included men and women in the study age 20 or older and that they ,0
broke down the population into categories that included age they certainly looked at race and ethnicity they looked at educational background they looked at body mass total energy intake which is really important if you think about it people are going to be eating and within the thing things that they eat they're going to be consuming ,0
some Omega-3s hopefully as well some omega-6s and if they're eating far more then they're going to get far more of likely going to get far more of both of those things than they would ordinarily if they were eating smaller amounts so they controlled for total caloric intake in a way that I find particularly useful for looking at these ,0
kind of data so the reason they explored Omega-3s is worth mentioning omega-3 fatty acids are known to have an anti-inflammatory effect that anti-inflammatory effect is mediated through a couple of different Pathways we won't go into these in too much detail now but the omega-3 fatty acids keep in mind actually make up various ,0
parts of cells in the brain and body that's right the membrane that remember I talked before about how steroid hormones can go through the different membranes of the cells the outer membrane and the inner membrane a lot of those actual membranes the structural constituents of neurons and other cells are actually made up of or include ,0
certain fatty acid long-chain fatty acids and the omega-3 fatty acids are important for or the actual construction of those tissues as well as having anti-inflammatory effects through things like limiting prostaglandins and other things that can cause inflammation okay so there are a bunch of different ways that omega-3 fatty acids can be useful ,0
they refer in this study to an earlier study that looked at the so-called analgesic effect the pain relieving effect analgesic means pain relieving effect of omega-3 fatty acids in what had been a randomized controlled trial and in that previous paper what they found was that diets high in Omega-3s and low in omega-6s okay so high three ,0
low six and as compared to diets that were just reduced omega-6s they found a greater analgesic effect of increasing Omega-3s while also reducing omega-6 fatty acids so in the context of the seed oil discussion although keeping in mind that omega-6s can come from other sources as well if omega-6s were just reduced on their own there wasn't as ,0
great in effect in terms of reducing pain and inflammation as there was when omega-3 fatty acids were deliberately increased and omega-6 fatty acids were reduced again in all of these studies because these are the ones in which they controlled things well as we should as we say they are holding constant the caloric intake so it's not just that ,0
you're removing fat eating less fat there's actually a removal of certain fats and fatty acids and a replacement of those with omega-3 fatty acids in one case in the other case it's just a reduction in omega-6s and you're using other food types and macronutrients to offset that that reduction in calories caused by reducing omega-6s the basic ,0
takeaway that they're relying on marching into the study is that increasing Omega-3s and reducing omega-6s seems to be beneficial for reducing pain and indeed in this study they find something quite similar which is that when you hold caloric intake constant and when you look at omega-6s whether or not you decrease omega-6 ,0
fatty acids or not you find is that increasing omega-3 fatty acids in the diet so either consumed through food sources or by supplementation was associated with a lower prevalence of severe headache or migraine so severe tension type headache or migraine so this is promising and points to the fact that long chain omega-3 fatty acids are ,0
likely to have either a pain reducing and there's evidence for that and or an inflammation reducing effect that can significantly reduce the severity of headache in both tension type headache and in migraine so that's the first study the second study is a more recent study it was published in 2021 that used a I would say a more or less similar ,0
type of overall design is the one I'd refer to earlier the title of this paper is dietary alteration of what they call N3 but those are omega-3 and n6 omega-6 sorry for this shift in nomenclature I didn't write the paper dietary alteration of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for headache reductions in adults with ,0
migraine and this was a randomized control trial randomized control trials involve having people be in one condition where they do one thing and then they get swapped randomly into another condition so they serve as their own internal control and that controls for all sorts of things like differences in sex differences in age differences in ,0
health background in any number of other variables as best as one can in this study they had people either ingest a diet that had increased Omega-3s so increased EPA and DHA or increased EPA and DHA and reduced amounts of linoleic acid okay so that's going to reduce omega-6s ,0
or a control diet in which they had people taking well it's essentially the average intake of Omega-3s and omega-6s and you can probably already guess what the general results of the study are going to be the general results were that there were reductions in headaches okay the really cool thing is it was a massive reduction in headache okay this ,0
was they refer to it as a robust reduction in headache in particular for the subjects that increase their Omega-3s and reduce the amount of linoleic acid that they took the other thing that I really like about this study is that while they don't know the exact underlying mechanism for the effect they did spend some time ,0
delineating what it is that the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are likely doing to either offset or exacerbate headache now I didn't say that omega-6 fatty acids exacerbate headache but it does seem that people who ingest more linoleic acid and omega-6 are experiencing more inflammation and that is evident in a bunch of different ,0
conditions one for instance is or increases in things like cgrp cgrp is a molecule that's associated with the calcium signaling pathway it's involved in vasodilation the expansion of the blood vessels and capillaries and that's known as I mentioned earlier to exacerbate certain forms of headache okay there are ,0
also forms of headache that can be caused by vasoconstriction we'll talk about one very dramatic example perhaps as we get toward the end it's a very uncommon example but um it's a it's called Thunderclap headache and trust me you do not want Thunderclap headache um and so we'll talk about Thunderclap headache a little bit later that ,0
involves constriction of the blood vessels in any case in this paper they they didn't study mechanism directly but they're resting on this known analgesic anti-pain as well as known anti-inflammatory Pathways related to increasing omega-3 intake and simultaneously resting on the idea where I think there's I think we now can say ,0
conclusion that omega-6 fatty acids in particular linoleic acid can increase inflammation by way of increasing things like cgrp vasodilation and some other Pathways related to the so-called inflammatory cytokine Pathways and there's a whole discussion nowadays of What's called the inflammatorium so the basic takeaway is that if you are ,0
interested in reducing headache it may be beneficial at least according to these two studies and another one I'll talk about in a moment to increase amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and that can be done again through the ingestions of foods although based on the dosages that we'll talk about in a moment increasing omega-3 fatty acids by taking ,0
liquid form fish oil which is perhaps the most cost effective way to supplement Omega-3s or capsules which is perhaps the most efficient way to supplement Omega-3s relate to a level of one gram or more of EPA per day again that's the EPA form in particular so if you're for instance taking supplemental fish oil or you're getting your Omega-3s ,0
from food and you're getting what you determine to be 2 000 milligrams or two grams per day of Omega-3s keep in mind that's going to include EPA ndha and it does seem that getting above one gram per day of EPA omega-3 fatty acids either through food or supplements or both is going to be the critical threshold for reductions in the ,0
frequency and intensity of headaches that include both tension headaches and migraine headaches now some people will find actually that ingesting far more omega-3 fatty acids generally through supplementation but again can be accomplished through Foods as well can also be beneficial for other things such as mood and indeed there's a whole ,0
literature related to effects of ingesting one to three grams again three grams per day of EPA so that's going to require quite a high intake of Omega-3s in whatever form or supplement you decide to take those into your body but that that can improve mood and so forth the basic range that I was able to find in ,0
the meta-analysis so meta-analyzes are where a researcher will look at the results of a bunch of different studies focused on the same thing look at the different strength of those studies they'll do all sorts of cool statistical gymnastics like remove the most potent study the one that had the greatest effect and see whether or not they're ,0
still an effect of some treatment or for instance they will swap in and out different studies and different combinations to see whether or not any one study is really leading to the conclusion that a given treatment does something in any case in the meta-analysis of omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of headache and that ,0
includes all the different kinds of headache they found in exploring a huge range of Omega-3 supplementation ranging from 200 milligrams all the way up to 2 000 milligrams per day it really was at the one gram or higher dosage per day where the significant impact on reducing ,0
headache frequency and intensity was found and just very briefly earlier I mentioned that not only is omega-3 fatty acids supplementation been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of headache in tension type and migraine type headache but it's also been shown to improve outcomes for premenstrual syndrome related headaches ,0
these are what we refer to earlier as hormone-based headaches again the low estrogen low progesterone associated with certain phases of the menstrual cycle as well as other phase of the menstrual cycle are often associated with headache in uh study entitled effective omega-3 fatty acids on premenstrual syndrome a systematic ,0
review and again meta-analysis what they found and here I'm paraphrasing the conclusion was that omega-3 fatty acids could yes effectively reduce the severity of PMS symptoms and one of the symptoms in particular that they found what that was reduced was the pain related symptoms associated with headache and they ,0
not tension type headaches are going to come on because of some chronic psychological stress usually combined with lack of sleep usually combined with lifestyle issues and of course without getting into a long discussion about it anytime you have lack of sleep you're going to have excessive stress anytime you have excessive stress you're going ,1
that 43 43 percent of females suffer from migraine that is recurring headaches that qualify as migraine headaches and that 17 percent of men suffer from migraine headaches on a recurring basis which is again the definition of a migraine headache or one of the key definitions so all we can say for sure is that many ,1
exist in the brain and around the brain and that are going to cause the pain you're going to activate those Sensory neurons those non-iceceptors that will then give us the experience of extreme headache and migraine so taking an aspirin or something like it for migraine in some cases the worst possible Choice again so knowing what ,1
kind of headache you are experiencing is going to be essential here the other thing that you'll sometimes hear is that drinking a cup of coffee or getting caffeine through tea is a great way to deal with headache why would that be well it turns out that coffee can cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation depending on when you ,1
tissue of the nose more often than not the most inflammation is occurring on the the branch that innervates the lip or the region close to the lip and that's why a cold sword develops there an immune response there signaling that there's inflammation due to the herpes virus which lives on that neuron for a very long time neurons don't turn over ,1
forehead and other parts of the head can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion or being quote unquote knocked out but sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion most traumatic brain injury and ,1
concussion and low-level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living that is lowered cognition disruption and mood sleep Etc is actually the consequence of things other than Sports so for instance bicycle accidents playground accidents construction accidents and this is often ,1
headaches so the first substance that I'd like to highlight that has been shown to significantly reduce the intensity and or frequency of headaches is creatine now creatine as many of you know is something that people supplement and take most often creatine is discussed in the context of muscle performance not just ,1
retinal ganglion cells in the eye respond best to bright green or blue light and they send connections to a bunch of different places in the brain including the so-called Central circadian clock superchiasmatic nucleus that sets your day night sleep wake rhythms this is why I encourage people to view sunlight in the morning to set ,1
experiencing photophobia in addition and I mentioned this at the beginning of the episode but many people find photophobia to be a entry point or a trigger to headache so what happens is they start to experience some Aura some onset of photophobia and then the photophobia itself leads to this feeling of malaise that then converts into headache and so ,1
while there are not a lot of clinical data on this just yet an emerging idea in the realm of headache treatment is the idea that if you can offset some of the early signs you can offset some of that photophobia and aura perhaps to the use of dim red lights or red lights as I've described a moment ago then you might be able to reduce the ,1
does is it it prevents a certain step in the release of so-called neurotransmitter in the little packets that they live in which are called vesicles little little spheres of neurotransmitter live at the end of neuron nerve Terminals and are released onto the muscle make the muscle contract botulinum neurotoxin Cleaves a ,1
oil also contained eucalyptus oil they had another group used just peppermint oil they had another group use just tiny traces of peppermint oil and smaller doses of eucalyptus oil and then they had a fourth group which was just using Placebo when I say using what they were doing is they were sponge applying the oil to the temples and forehead of ,1
side effects and that of course can also include the use of essential oils in conjunction with things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs or the use of red light to offset photophobia in conjunction with any number of different treatments either prescription or otherwise so I do want to make that clear and I especially want to make that ,1
clear as I transition to the next segment where I'm going to tell you about herbal treatments for migraine and this is based on what I consider a very comprehensive review of many randomized control studies indeed the title of the paper is herbal treatments for migraine a systematic review of randomized controlled studies and this was ,1
actually had some very nice hypotheses as to why that likely would be and in fact point out that in earlier studies omega-3 fatty acids have actually been considered as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in some cases and indeed there are prescription forms of omega-3 fatty acids and I highlight that not because I think people need to ,0
run out and get the prescription form of omega-3 fatty acids they're actually quite hard to obtain and quite expensive but because I think oftentimes when we're talking about something like omega-3 fatty acids the fact that they are available over the counter in a supplement or by liquid or available in food for that matter ,0
leads many people to conclude that oh you know this is supplementation this is something that um you know it's going to have relatively weak or minor impact on things like headache or other health metrics but let's just say that the fact that it exists as a prescription drug and its highest potency form at least in ,0
my opinion points to the potency of omega-3 fatty acids in dealing with analgesic effects that is reducing pain and anti-inflammation as well as some of the known cardiovascular improvements that are associated with increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake put simply Omega-3s are not just something that comes from food or supplements they are ,0
also being marketed as prescription drugs so I do think they need to be considered as quite potent and at least as far as these papers that again include meta-analyzes of many other papers and data sets indicate that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids to a point where you're getting above one gram per day of EPA is not just ,0
going to be beneficial for treating and reducing the frequency and intensity of one particular type of headache but many types of headaches and when you combine hormonal headaches tension headaches and migraine headaches you account for more than 70 percent of the total types of headaches that are out there the effects of Omega-3s on cluster headaches and ,0
some of the other types of headaches at least to my knowledge have not been evaluated there's no reason to think that Omega-3s would not be beneficial for those types of headaches but at least as far as the data sets we talked about here are concerned it is clear omega-3 fatty acids are going to be a very potent way ,0
to reduce pain and to reduce inflammation in ways that can reduce the frequency and the intensity of different kinds of headache before we continue our discussion about many not commonly known and yet very potent treatments for different forms of headache I want to touch on a topic we mentioned a little bit earlier and also provide a treatment ,0
that is in a way to alleviate something and that's photophobia and Aura now keep in mind that earlier I referred to Aura as this sense that something's about to happen that is true and that meaning that is an accurate description of Aura but oftentimes people also come to understand Aura as the feeling that something surrounds a given object ,0
visually or even that people have a sense that something's around them so again this can be a little bit vague but this idea that aura is a sense of something about to happen or that visually or in an auditory way and or maybe even in kind of a sense that something is about to happen in a certain environment and the reason I'm ,0
making uh kind of Arc shapes with my hands for those of you that are just listening I'm making art shapes with my hands is that aura is often described as kind of a Halo or a um emanating out from from one's body or from something that they're looking at again nothing spiritual about this in the context of the discussion about migraine and ,0
headache but rather many people experience photophobia sometimes with aura sometimes no and I just want to touch on a couple of the mechanisms by which aurum photophobia occur and mentioned just briefly a pretty well established way that people can start to offset photophobia and again I mentioned that because many people experience ,0
photophobia in headache but there are also a number of people that experience photophobia even if they don't have intense headaches so photophobia is pretty common pretty debilitate it actually is one of the reasons why people feel not well and need to leave work or not go to school or or leave school these kinds of things or lay in ,0
bed all day or dim the lights not go outside again sunlight being so congruent with health you can imagine how photophobia can lead to all sorts of negative Downstream consequences okay so what is Aura and what is photophobia the exact origins of ARA aren't exactly clear but it is generally thought that what Aura represents is what's called ,0
spreading depression and this is not depression of one's mood although it can be associated with that this is depression of neuronal activity again neurons communicate with one another by generating electrical impulses that travel down the length of their of their so-called axons which are like little wires and then they dump ,0
neurotransmitter out at the so-called synapse and impact the electrical activity of other neurons depression is a electrical or I should say a chemical electrical chemoelectrical is the proper term phenomenon in which the excitability of neurons is reduced so again doesn't have anything to do with depression as a mood ,0
State per se rather it is a reduced excitability of neurons and it's been shown in some Imaging studies that aura is associated with a back to front so from the back of the brain to front spreading depression like a wave of lowering levels of electrical excitability and because this originates in the visual cortex which is in the ,0
back so that's the part of your brain that is making sense of visual images coming in through the eyes and relayed through other stations in the brain that people will start to see a kind of Halo of light or that they'll start to feel that the light around them is literally surrounding their body or some other object or body that they're ,0
looking at and then it spreads forward in the brain and that's when it tends to stretch over into other so-called sensory modalities sensory modalities being things like touch or hearing so people will get the sense that kind of seeing something in their periphery of their Vision then they'll start feeling something around them there's a sense ,0
that something's about to happen so is this spreading wave of depression goes from Back to Front people experience a number of these different semi-abstract sensory phenomena that we Call Aura okay so that's how Aura originates now photophobia is a little bit different photophobia We Now understand because of some beautiful work that was done at ,0
Cliff saper's Lab at Harvard Medical School and some other Laboratories showing that photophobia originates from a specific set of neurons in the eye we call these the intrinsically photosensitive melanops and ganglion cells which is really just a mouthful of nerd speak for neurons in the eye that connect to the brain these so-called ,0
ganglion cells that respond most robustly to bright blue light or other shortwavelength light so you've got short wavelength light that is blue and greens or short wavelengths and then long wavelet light which is red or you know it can even be out past red will be infrared we don't detect infrared consciously other ,0
species do like pit vipers can see in the infrared they can even heat sense so short wavelength light is going to be light that's that's bright blue green it's what's very common in fluorescent bulbs that are commonly used in household lighting and workplace lighting and other forms of artificial lighting it's also of course present in ,0
sunlight sunlight includes a huge range of wavelengths including long wavelength light of course you've seen that as the Reds and oranges in the sunset and so on those intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in the eye respond best to bright green or blue light and they send connections to a bunch of different places in the brain ,0
including the so-called Central circadian clock superchiasmatic nucleus that sets your day night sleep wake rhythms this is why I encourage people to view sunlight in the morning to set this system in motion to avoid bright light exposure at night from artificial sources in order to not send wake-up signals from the eye to the ,0
brain and then on to the rest of the body but these intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are also known to connect with other areas of the brain many other areas of the brain in fact and one of the important areas of the brain they connect to as it relates to photophobia is an area of a structure called the ,0
thalamus the thalamus is an egg-like structure that sits in the center of the brain and it serves as a kind of a switchboard like a sensory relay by which information coming from the eyes from the ears from The Touch system Etc are funneled into different compartments in the thalamus and then sent to different other areas of the brain so ,0
think of it kind of like an old-fashioned switchboard or um you could think of it uh sort of like a in an airport you go uh to a particular um wing of the airport then you go to a particular gate and so on you're getting funneled progressively through uh ,0
narrower narrower channels until you arrive at your particular plane much in the same way the thalamus has a bunch of different entry points so it's sensory information coming in from a bunch of different sources and those sources get routed into progressively narrower and narrower funnels to eventually arrive at the ,0
accurate place for their function so these intrinsically photosensitive gangling cells send connections to a small but important area of the thalamus called LP it's denoted L the letter and P with lateral posterior thalamus or that I should say it's the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus for uficionados out there and then the ,0
neurons in that location are going to respond that is they're going to be activated by bright blue light green light or any kind of bright light originating from artificial sources or from sunlight and the neurons there that respond to that have a very interesting pattern of connections they send connections up to the so-called sensory ,0
cortex so a bunch of different layers throughout the cortex that are not associated with visual perception that is they're not associated with understanding that there are shapes and Contours in the environment but rather to neurons that are involved in the detection of pressure pain and other forms of sensory information at the ,0
level of what the meninges we talked about the meninges earlier so again while the brain itself does not have a sensory system to detect pain the tissues around it do and the tissues around those tissues that is the stuff around the meninges themselves can respond to pain and intracranial pressure is also ,0
relayed through the meninges to our conscious awareness that there's pain so what does this mean for photophobia it means that bright blue light and green light and of course light from sunlight we'll activate these neurons in the eye these intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells which then activate the ,0
lateral posterior neurons LP neurons and those LP neurons communicate with areas of the brain that are specifically tuned to different sensory phenomena and in particular pain at the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure what this means is that when we have headache or if we simply have photophobia on its own that bright light is actually the ,0
trigger for pain sensing and even the creation of pain at the level of the meninges and intracranial pressure what does this mean in terms of dealing with or treating photophobia well most people deal with photophobia by deciding to turn off or dim all the lights and simply getting under the covers or wearing a very um low brim hat and ,0
putting on sunglasses and they want to lie down and sometimes because uh migraine can be associated with nausea or even vomiting and it's severe instances rather but one very simple way to avoid activation of these retinal ganglion cells that would trigger photophobia is that if you are starting to feel like you have a ,0
migraine coming on or you have photophobia coming on to shift to using patterns of light that are in the longer wavelength domain what that means practically is Shifting to using very orange ideally dim but very orange and red light now this is not a call for people to go out and invest in expensive red light therapies admittedly there are ,0
some excellent case uses for red light therapy particularly for acne wound healing even for improving Vision especially in people beyond the age of 40 for some hormone augmentation we talked all about that in the episode that I did on light and health again you can find that at hubermanlab.com everything time stamped what I'm talking ,0
about here would be simply having some red light bulbs on hand for any time that you need to remain awake but you're starting to experience photophobia these red light bulbs can be purchased very in expensively you know as party lights you can buy these online so there is no specific need to get any uh I would say red light ,0
that's designed specifically for photophobia or anything that sort you can find the cheapest um red light available out there and those will simply work the idea being that for many people who are experiencing photophobia they want to reduce that feeling of pain and pressure in their head experience through photophobia they also might want ,0
to stay awake get some work done and do things so operating under red light or I should say living working Etc under red light would allow you to stay awake not have to hide under the covers if you're experiencing photophobia in addition and I mentioned this at the beginning of the episode but many people find photophobia to be a entry point or a trigger to ,0
headache so what happens is they start to experience some Aura some onset of photophobia and then the photophobia itself leads to this feeling of malaise that then converts into headache and so while there are not a lot of clinical data on this just yet an emerging idea in the realm of headache treatment is the idea that if you can offset some of ,0
the early signs you can offset some of that photophobia and aura perhaps to the use of dim red lights or red lights as I've described a moment ago then you might be able to reduce the probability that you're going to have a migraine or other type of headache entirely so again no need for expensive red lights but you can find red lights ,0
very easily online and simply have them on hand or replace the current lights that you have on your nightstand or in whatever room you happen to be in with these red lights these red lights are also I should mention very useful in limiting the amount of cortisol a stress hormone that is very healthy for us to release at high levels early in the day ,0
in fact viewing sunlight will increase cortisol levels it's another reason why what I'm about to say is relevant to photophobia but if you want to keep cortisol levels low in the evening and at night and indeed you do and improve the transition to sleep and indeed your sleep overall reducing cortisol at evening time and at night time is ,0
extremely beneficial and red lights will help you accomplish that I talked about that in the episode on light and health so the point here is that if you suffer from photophobia with or without aura using red lights and not simply dimming ordinary artificial lights or feeling that you have to turn off all lights entirely is going to be one relatively ,0
inexpensive or I should say a very inexpensive in some cases because these red lights can be found very inexpensively online way to be able to continue with your daily activities at least in an indoor environment if you are suffering from photophobia so shifting back to ways to reduce the intensity and frequency of different ,0
kinds of headaches we haven't talked so much about tension headaches specifically so that's what I'd like to do now is you recall tension headaches are going to be muscular in origin again keeping in mind that everything's neural when it comes to pain everything's normal when it comes to everything frankly because every organ and tissue ,0
system in our body is ultimately controlled by our nervous system but tension headaches are often associated with tension of the muscles that are on the skull of the jaw of the neck and can be quite painful for many people and debilitating and the most common treatment for this that most people rely on that is is to take non-steroid ,0
anti-inflammatory so things like acetaminophen ibuprofen sometimes aspirin and things of that sort and oftentimes those can be helpful there are a couple things to keep in mind however the NSAIDs non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will work very well at first but people quickly develop a tolerance to them ,0
meaning they're going to have to take more and more in order to get the same effect and oftentimes they can't take more and more because some of them are very hard on the liver and in addition to that some of them can offset some other things that you really want so for instance it's now known that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can offset some ,0
of the benefits of exercise and that makes sense because a lot of the Adaptive benefits of exercise actually come from experiencing a lot of inflammation acute that means you actually want inflammation during a resistance training workout or even your endurance workout but then that inflammation triggers an adaptation ,0
event or series of adaptation events that leads to Greater strength greater speed more muscle more endurance whatever it is that you happen to be training for so reducing pain can be good of course but not if you have to take more and more of a given drug that it has side effects on the liver and can offset the effects of ,0
exercise and so forth the other issue with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs is that many of them simply do not work for many people or again they'll work the first time and the second time but then they stop working they also tend to lower body temperature I think most people are aware of this because many of these same drugs are used in order to ,0
reduce fever but if you are taking non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs simply to reduce your headache and your lowing core body temperature that can have all sorts of Downstream issues related to sleep wake Cycles to metabolism to immune system function more generally and on and on for that reason ,0
there's been quite a lot of exploration of alternatives to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of headache and indeed pain generally but today we're talking about headache now as it relates to Tension Headache one of the more advanced kind of modern treatments that you sometimes hear about is Botox right Botox I think ,0
most people are familiar with as the thing that people get injected into their face around the eyes or around the lips or elsewhere in order to quote unquote reduce wrinkles it was discovered some years ago when Botox treatments were being done for cosmetic reasons that it could often be very effective for relieving headache if ,0
injected into the muscles and the way that it works is that of course Tension Headache involves a tension of the muscles a kind of a we'll call it clinching or cinching up with the muscles but we're really talking about is contraction of the muscles and that's controlled by neurons neurons which are neuromuscular ,0
so neuromuscular neurons that don't form synapses with or connections with other neurons they form synapses with muscle they release acetylcholine onto the muscle and that makes the muscle contract this is the way you move the limbs of your body this is also a way the muscles of your head contract and can give you tension type headaches ,0
Botox arises from or is rather botulinum neurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin is a toxin that's found in canned goods not all canned goods of course and what it does is it it prevents a certain step in the release of so-called neurotransmitter in the little packets that they live in which are called ,0
vesicles little little spheres of neurotransmitter live at the end of neuron nerve Terminals and are released onto the muscle make the muscle contract botulinum neurotoxin Cleaves a particular protein in there for you aficionados who want to look this up it's a really cool mechanism it Cleaves something called Snap 25. Snap 25 is ,0
involved in the fusion of those little spheres with the membrane of the neuron and releasing of the neurotransmitter so when botulinum neurotoxin is present at the nerve muscle interface those nerves cannot communicate with the muscle and as a consequence the muscles undergo kind of flaccid tone they just kind of relax there underneath the skin ,0
sure wrinkles are relieved but if Botox is injected into the muscles themselves it can provide long-lasting relief of certain types of headaches in particular tension type headaches so while it seems like a bit of an extreme treatment people who suffer very badly from tension type headaches due to hyper contraction of the muscles of the ,0
forehead or around the temples or around the Jaws or the or certain parts of the the neck and the MUSC muscles of the neck that encroach on the on the back of the skull or that actually connect to the back of the skull can achieve tremendous long lasting relief from these Botox injections sometimes for weeks or months ,0
or even longer people go in for periodic uh you know re-ups of Botox it actually is quite safe despite the fact that botulinum neurotoxin is quite dangerous it's given in very low Doses and given locally so those are the only muscles affected so that's how Botox is used to treat headaches and um it's a very effective treatment at that of course ,0
many people I imagine are interested in not just drug based treatments and not Botox type treatments for treating headache but other types of treatments for headache that are of the more so let's call them natural or um non-drug treatments and here we're starting to get into the realm of the kind of herbal and oil-based treatments ,0
for headache now I confess when I first started researching this area of headache and treatment for headaches that is um I found myself approaching it with a bit of trepidation because when I started to hear about essential oils and about herbal medications and things of that sort I thought okay well there'll ,0
probably be some effects I mean admittedly we've talked before on this podcast about things like apogenin epigenin is one of the core components of chamomile and chamomile is known to make people feel a little bit sleepy and can enhance sleep well apogenic and high concentration can indeed augment sleep ,0
we talk about this in our sleep tool kit by the way we don't just have episodes about sleep master or sleep perfect your sleep Etc but if you go to the hubermanlab.com website and you go to the menu and you click on newsletter you can scroll down you'll see that we have a tool kit for sleep this is completely zero cost to access you don't even have ,0
to sign up although if you'd like to sign up for future newsletters you can get those one of the key components of the toolkit for sleep in addition to behavioral tools and things that are not supplement based is apogenin which is this component from chamomile so the idea that certain herbal derivatives or herbs or Oils could be very useful for ,0
improving symptoms of whatever in this case improving sleep with apogenin is not unheard of and in fact the data continued to be released all the time that many of the things that we think of as herbal Etc can actually have quite potent effects and so um while I myself was approaching the ,0
discussion about essential oils and um or I should say oils right who's to say if they're essential or not oils and herbs in the treatment of headache I finished out my research on this literature feeling um quite I should say uh surprised and um and as if I need to really check myself a bit because what I found is ,0
that there are certain herbs and oils for instance that far outperform non-steroid and anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of headache that's right there are certain oils that are available over the counter that when looked at in many studies meta-analyzes and I'll tell you about one particular study and a meta-analysis in a moment ,0
they show that they can reduce the frequency and intensity of headache in a manner that far outpaces What You observe with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs with apparently none of the same issues associated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs so I think it's really worth paying attention to the first of those studies I'd like ,0
to describe to you is one that has now become kind of a classic in the literature I should say at least for those that are interested in the atypical treatments for headache and the title of this paper is effective peppermint and eucalyptus oil preparations on neurophysiological and experimental ,0
alge's metric headache parameters okay what does that mean well this is an interesting study because rather than look at the effectiveness of peppermint and eucalyptus oil and other oils on headache what they did is because they want to look at the mechanisms underlying headache which I confess I love the fact that they want to ,0
understand the neurophysiology and not just get subjective ratings of headache although they did that too but they really want to understand how these oils can impact things like muscular tension or perception of pain what they did is they recreated headache in human subjects by using tightening cuffs of the of the head they cut off ,0
blood supply to certain areas of the head they basically induced headache and then they measured things like the EMG the muscle response at the level of electrophysiology in the muscle and of course subjective measures of how much people perceive to be in pain or not in pain I'll give you the broad Contour of the study because I want to make sure ,0
that it's the conclusions that come through most clearly and we will provide a link to the study in our show note captions so what they did is they had people use one of four different preparations say preparation one which includes some peppermint oil and some eucalyptus oil and all the details about the amount and the relative percentages ,0
are in the paper for you to peruse online through the link I mentioned before so they had four different groups they had one group apply peppermint oil but that peppermint oil also contained eucalyptus oil they had another group used just peppermint oil they had another group use just tiny traces of peppermint oil and smaller ,0
doses of eucalyptus oil and then they had a fourth group which was just using Placebo when I say using what they were doing is they were sponge applying the oil to the temples and forehead of people and then what they did is they used these different approaches to measure the activation of muscles to measure pain and they then induced head ,0
pain they induced headache so and they looked at the temporal muscles on the side they looked at forehead muscles things of that sort so they used three different types of pain stimuli they looked at people's sensitivity to experimentally induced Pain by either providing pressure so this was kind of a cuff around the forehead ,0
or thermal pain so they actually had them basically heat heat it up at the level of the skin and actually they brought the heat up pretty high to the point where people were rating the pain almost to the to the point of um excessive pain and pain limits so they obviously couldn't take them to the point of extreme pain and they had a ,0
constriction type condition in which they cut off blood circulation to the pericranial muscles using an inflatable collar around the cranium and they inflated that to pretty high pressure so kind of a brutal experiment to be involved in but look they're trying to mimic headache and I think by using these different approaches they're able ,0
to mimic the different aspects of headache and make sure and here's the key point that every person in the study is not just getting the same treatment for headache but is getting the same headache and that's something that I think gives this study power it's not the only way to do a study like this but it gives it a lot of power in trying to ,0
understand which types of interventions are going to assist in headache and maybe even specific dimensions of the pain and headache and basically what they found in the study is that of all the treatments they used the essential plant oil preparations that contained peppermint and I'll just mention as an aside and in ,0
other studies Menthol so these minty type uh essential minty type um what we think of as flavors but are really Aromas as well and as I'll point out the mechanism in a moment they have the effect of significantly reducing the intensity of the pain that is subjects could tolerate the pain far better and experienced less pain subjectively and ,0
the magnitude of the effects were really pretty impressive again I went into all this thinking essential oils okay that's like some really woo stuff um you know I don't know about that but it turns out that these essential oils at least the ones that contain peppermint oil with or without eucalyptus oil performed very well in ,0
reducing pain the key takeaway from the study is and here I'm paraphrasing from the study of that the combination of peppermint oil eucalyptus oil and these are basically in a ethanol suspension again people are not drinking these essential oils I want to be very clear they're applying these to the to the skin ,0
around the area that's in pain and particularly the temple and the foreheads increased cognitive performance I didn't talk about that but this is the ability to maintain cognitive functioning while in pain you know here we're talking about headache up until now just as kind of pain but that pain can be very ,0
debilitating for your ability to work and perform and do other things so this combination of peppermint oil and eucalyptus oil applied to the skin allow people to increase their cognitive performance while under pain and had a very muscle relaxing and mentally relaxing effect mental relaxation was of course measured ,0
subjectively but remember one of the things that led me to feature this study in this episode in particular is that they didn't just say oh my muscles feel more relaxed they actually saw that the muscles of the forehead and temples and some surrounding muscles were more relaxed when people had these oils on applied to their forehead and the ,0
temples not perhaps to the same degree that one would observe with botox or for the same extent or duration as one would experience with botox but much in the same way which then raises the question of what's going on here I mean is this all placebo effect well no because they compared to Placebo and they controlled for the odor of course of the oil that ,0
was applied so that everyone thought that they were getting essentially the same thing pun intended but in this case what they found is that if they applied the essential oil to the forehead and temples that people experience a more or less a cooling sensation or they could feel as if something was happening in the ,0
underlying muscle well what was happening we now know that Menthol peppermint and other things that smell that way and taste that way actually have an impact on the sensory neurons at the level of the skin and can actually inhibit certain Sensory neurons and can activate other Sensory neurons okay so in order to understand this we have to ,0
go back to what I said at the beginning of the episode which is that you have motor neurons these are neurons that constrict muscles or excuse me that cause contraction of muscles strict them they cause contraction of muscles you have Sensory neurons which sense different things light sound or touch and you have modulatory neurons ,0
Menthol and Eucalyptus are actually known to activate certain channels in the sensory neurons that respond not just a touch but also the sensation of cooling okay so when we think of Menthol and peppermint we think of kind of cool scents and flavors cool meaning cold and when we think of things like hot peppers capsaicin we think of anything ,0
that has a hot temperature we tend to think of spicy so spicy and hot go together and peppermint and menthol and cool go together much in the way that the gum commercials or the mint commercials would lead you to believe and in fact they're right so what's happening here is that the application of these oils is very likely activating ,0
choose from in order to address and provide relief from any of the different types of headache before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general ,1
public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is thesis thesis makes custom nootropics and as many of you know I'm not a fan of the word nootropics because nootropics means smart drugs and as a neuroscientist I can tell you there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart thesis ,1
with momentous supplements to find the supplements we discuss on the huberman Lab podcast you can go to live momentous spelled ous live momentous.com huberman and I should just mention that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding again that's livemomentis.com huberman let's talk about headaches and as we are soon going ,1
to learn there are different types of headaches and different types of headaches arise from changes in different types of tissues in the head area and indeed in the neck area as well now one of the key things to understand is that if you want relief from a headache you need to understand which tissue is mainly involved in creating ,1
again you don't want to think about the brain as just sitting right next to the skull it's close by but there are a bunch of other thin fibrous tissues many of which are very thin and fragile and others of which such as the dura that are very very strong because they're very fibrous almost like a uh if you've ever felt for instance the sale of a of ,1
a sailboat you might think oh it's just this big flapping sheet in the wind it is anything but a sheet in the Wind it is a very very strong and durable material now the proximity of the dura and the meninges to the brain and the fact that everything is wrapped very tightly together and the fact that there's a lot of vasculature so that ,1
you'd like to check that out you go to hubermanlab.com just put into our search function immune system and you can find that episode by the way all of our episodes are searchable by keyword hubermanlab.com and it'll take you to specific episodes and time stamps for the topics you're interested in so for sake of this discussion about headache ,1
Sensory neurons they communicate the same way that motor neurons do that is they fire what we call Action potentials which are just electrical signals they release neurotransmitters like any other neuron but they respond to certain events in the environment or the environment within the body ,1
neurons and motor neurons and turns out those approaches exist as well okay so at this point I promise you that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology lesson in terms of pain sensing and headaches as a more uh conceptual phenomenon instead what I'd like to do next is talk about the different types of headaches and I think this is ,1
something that's very important and not often discussed except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of headaches like migraine or cluster or tension headache but I think for most people out there who experience headache and again that is everybody at some point experiences headache rather than ,1
a vasoconstriction associated with drinking caffeine so if you have a headache that is associated with excessive vasodilation and pressure in the head indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction by preventing that adenosine pathway that would normally lead to vasoconstriction and you can get some relief from that ,1
headache however caffeine is also a vasodilator caffeine has the ability to impinge on the so-called no pathway the nitric oxide pathway which is a nerve to blood pathway that involves a few different enzymes that we won't get into right now but maybe in a future episode that causes dilation of the blood vessels and as a consequence drinking ,1
anti-inflammatory but they also can impinge on other Pathways in particular hormonal Pathways and in fact curcumin AKA turmeric can alter the synthesis of something called dihydrotestosterone dihydrotestosterone is involved in an enormous range of different bodily functions it's involved in libido it's involved in Men in beard growth and in ,1
Not only would you feel miserable maybe even pass out but lose vision and certain brain areas will actually die off in the absence of blood flow to those areas we know this more commonly as stroke so I don't want to strike fear in anybody about eating a you know a jalapeno or even a very spicy meal from time to time but if you're not somebody ,1
you might be experiencing can be very beneficial for understanding which sorts of treatments ought to be best and perhaps also best avoided in trying to alleviate those headaches or prevent them from happening at all we talked about tension headaches migraine headaches hormone-based headaches cluster headaches and traumatic brain ,1
injury related headaches we talked about different types of treatments ranging from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation some herbal and indeed some essential oil treatments as well as acupuncture all of which have been shown to have significant impact in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches and in many cases reductions in the ,1
things like improving sleep hormone support and focus huberman Lab podcast has partnered with momentous supplements because momentous supplements are of the very highest quality and they include single ingredient formulations this is very important as I pointed out in the episode about a rational approach to supplementation single ingredient ,1
formulations allow you to develop the most biologically effective and cost-effective approach to supplementation in addition momentous ships internationally which is important because I realize that many of you reside outside of the United States if you'd like to see the supplements described on this and other episodes of ,1
channels in the sensory neurons including the trip channels but others as well that are leading to the analges effect by shutting down the heat and pain Pathways because heat and pain while they're not exactly the same in our nervous system they are funneled through common Pathways whereas Cooling and Pain Relief are funneled through ,0
alternate what we call parallel Pathways so the study on peppermint and eucalyptus oil preparations in reducing pain of headache and different aspects of pain due to headache I think are really important because they don't just illustrate the fact that yes indeed and you know going record saying it because that's what the data say and there are ,0
other papers to support this statement as well essential oils applied to the skin can reduce the symptoms of tension headache in a significant way and actually can lead to some offset of some of the cognitive defects seen with headaches so that's itself very impressive I must say surprising for me kind of put me in my ,0
place as somebody thought oh essential oils is going to be like okay but it's actually seemed to um really hold some Merit and when you compare the magnitude of the effect even though this was an enormous number of subjects you compare the magnet to the effect in a paper like this or similar papers on these essential oils to the impact of ,0
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and they really hold their own and in some cases exceed the positive impact of anti-inflammatory drugs so for that reason I think we can look at peppermint oils and peppermint and Eucalyptus containing oils Menthol containing oils applied to the skin for the treatment of tension type headache as um among the ,0
more potent treatments available out there now another way to approach treatment of tension headache is something that many of you have probably heard about before and then I've talked a little bit about on this podcast in previous episodes and that's acupuncture we will do an entire episode all about acupuncture but much ,0
in the same way that essential oils I think for many people not all but for many people are considered kind of a woo biology or people think of it as a very alternative medicine keep in mind that as the underlying mechanisms of things like these peppermint oils are starting to be discovered or Omega-3s are starting to be discovered ,0
mechanistically they hold up very well there's a logic there there's an underlying understanding of not just why they should work but in many cases how they work in the same way acupuncture which of course has existed for thousands of years has been used very successfully to treat headache and other forms of pain so much so that many ,0
insurance companies will now pay for acupuncture as an insured practice not all but many will and in addition to that the scientific Community is starting to understand mechanistically how acupuncture works so I don't want to make this the major Focus for now but ,0
very briefly there's a laboratory at Harvard Medical School run by chufuma chufu is well known in the Neuroscience Community for doing excellent work in parsing the mechanisms of touch sensation and pain in particular so not just touch at the level of skin but pain and pain Pathways and in recent years his laboratory has started to do studies ,0
on how acupuncture works because indeed acupuncture has been known to work to alleviate pain for a long time but the underlying mechanisms haven't been clear what chufu's lab has published now in excellent journals like nature science and other journals is that the precise insertion sites of different needles lead to activation of sensory neurons ,0
and their Downstream Pathways in ways that can potently reduce inflammation and that can be used to potently reduce the activity of certain muscles for instance muscles in the forehead and temples so when you hear acupuncture can reduce pain I think some people think oh well if there's needles sticking out of your face first of all that must hurt ,0
and actually the needles are very fine needles and skilled acupuncturists can insert them without any pain or actually the person receiving it doesn't even usually recognize that the needles are in that's how quickly and efficiently they can put them in and people don't detect any pain but that has been shown to greatly reduce pain in particular ,0
headache related pain and back-related pain in some other forms of pain chufu's lab has shown that the specific needle insertion sites can activate the sensory Pathways and can deactivate the sensory motor pathways and now you're familiar with Sensory neurons motor neurons and modulatory neurons and can modulate the activity of the pain Pathways by way of ,0
impacting the activity of all sorts of different organs including organs that give rise to some of the inflammatory cytokines so basically what I'm saying here is that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture and the maps of different insertion sites we now know or I should say people have long known and people in the west are starting to adopt ,0
the understanding that acupuncture yes indeed it really does work for relieving pain and Laboratories both in the United States such as chufus and elsewhere are starting to find the underlying mechanisms and those mechanisms include deactivation of the pain Pathways activation of some of the parallel Pathways that assist in shutting down ,0
pain or in relaxing the muscles that are causing tension type headache as well as activation of neural Pathways that impinge on organs that then cause or reduce the release of molecules into the body that give us the experience of pain so reduced inflammation and in many cases increasing anti-inflammatory Pathways so I just want to be sure to ,0
mention acupuncture and a little bit of mechanistic understanding of why acupuncture works because indeed acupuncture is shown to be quite effective for the treatment of tension type headache and to some extent migraine headache as well so we talked about omega-3 fatty acids we talked about essential oils we talked about ,0
acupuncture so this episode is starting to sound like alternative treatments to headache including migraine but I want to be very clear this is not about alternative treatments everything that I'm talking about here has a mechanistic basis and what we're talking about today are approaches to dealing with headache that ,0
yes are typically over-the-counter compounds or are grounded in nutrition or in the case of acupuncture behavioral practices but that are not necessarily meant as replacements for things like non-steroid inflammatory drugs or prescription drugs of course those things can still be taken many people derive benefit from ,0
them but the goal is always I believe I should hope for people to find ways that they can control their health outcomes and reduce things like headache using a minimum number of things that have other side effects and that of course can also include the use of essential oils in conjunction with things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs or the use of ,0
red light to offset photophobia in conjunction with any number of different treatments either prescription or otherwise so I do want to make that clear and I especially want to make that clear as I transition to the next segment where I'm going to tell you about herbal treatments for migraine and this is based on what I consider a very ,0
comprehensive review of many randomized control studies indeed the title of the paper is herbal treatments for migraine a systematic review of randomized controlled studies and this was published in 2020 and this contains an immense amount of information so we will provide a link to it for those of you that really want to dive deep on this in ,0
this paper they focus on a number of different reviews and Analysis of data focused on compounds for the treatment of migraine ranging from and including things like Menthol and peppermint oil so we already covered that so I won't cover that again in detail but in this review they highlight the results I refer to before plus other results that ,0
show that Menthol and peppermint oil can be quite effective in the treatment of tension type headache and in this case migraine headache as well so that's interesting that Menthol and peppermint oils can be used not just to treat tension type headaches but migraine headaches as well and they look at an enormous number of other types of ,0
herbal and essential oil type treatments everything from coriander to Citron to damask Rose chamomile lavender a bunch of things so I'm not going to go through each and every one of these in a lot of detail what I've tended to do today and I'm going to do now is to highlight the most potent of these different treatments again ,0
Menthol peppermint oil being among the most potent in addition to that there's a particular pathway that's associated with headache and when I say that I mean the different types of headache which includes the activation of this thing that we call cgrp cgrp again is involved in this calcium regulation pathway and leads to vasodilation ,0
of the vessels and arteries and capillaries in a way that can create pain and this feeling of pressure inside the head which can be very uncomfortable of course now earlier in the episode I mentioned that I was going to touch on caffeine and so I'm going to do that now now the reason I mention caffeine is that ,0
there's a sort of lore out there that if you have a headache drinking a cup of coffee can eliminate that headache a few things about that point first of all if you are somebody who ingests caffeine every day and you do not ingest caffeine you will indeed get a headache and drinking caffeine will relieve that particular headache so it's absolutely ,0
true that caffeine can relieve the lack of caffeine induced headache that's sort of a duh but that leads actually to a very important question which is why would that be the case well it turns out that caffeine is both a vasodilator and a vasoconstrictor how does it do that well one of the main ways in which caffeine makes us more ,0
alert is that it occupies The receptors for something called adenosine adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body more and more the longer we've been awake it's one of the things that makes us feel sleepy so when we drink caffeine that caffeine occupies the adenosine receptor and the adenosine cannot have its normal effect ,0
of making us sleepy when that caffeine wears off the adenosine combine and we feel sleepy adenosine is a vasodilator so when we drink caffeine because it blocks the effects of adenosine there is a vasoconstriction associated with drinking caffeine so if you have a headache that is associated with excessive vasodilation and pressure in ,0
the head indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction by preventing that adenosine pathway that would normally lead to vasoconstriction and you can get some relief from that headache however caffeine is also a vasodilator caffeine has the ability to impinge on the so-called no pathway the nitric oxide pathway which is a nerve to ,0
blood pathway that involves a few different enzymes that we won't get into right now but maybe in a future episode that causes dilation of the blood vessels and as a consequence drinking caffeine can also increase vasodilation so it's sort of a two-pronged effect now one of the ways in which you might think about this and perhaps utilize this is ,0
that if you are well rested or if it's early in the day and you've had some sleep the previous night adenosine levels are very likely to be low especially if you slept very well the night before under those conditions when you ingest caffeine you are not going to experience the vasoconstriction effects of caffeine ,0
that would ordinarily be there by inhibiting adenosine why because adenosine is not present at all and under those conditions drinking coffee ought to lead to some vasodilation not a lot but nonetheless vasodilation if however you haven't slept well or it's late in the day and you've been up for a long time drinking caffeine is likely to ,0
have more of a vasoconstriction effect and this is important because some of the treatments that you hear about that involve using caffeine to treat headache are as Extreme as okay if you have a headache at night drink a cup of coffee and then go to sleep I actually saw that in the literature which I couldn't quite believe because yes indeed some people ,0
can fall asleep after drinking caffeine but we know very well thanks to the beautiful work and science Communications of people like Dr Matthew Walker from University of California Berkeley and who's been a guest on this and many other podcasts that even if you can fall asleep after drinking caffeine ingesting caffeine within the 10 to 12 ,0
hours prior to bedtime is simply not a good idea because of the ways it disrupts the architecture of sleep so what's the takeaway about caffeine and headache and vasodil relation you need to be very clear on whether or not caffeine tends to remove your headache or exacerbate it now this is going to depend on time of day and the amount of ,0
adenosine in your system as I mentioned before but also there seems to be a kind of bimodal distribution whereby some people when they drink caffeine it really improves their headache and so in some cases a very significant effects whereas other people when they drink caffeine it really exacerbates their headache and as at least as far as I ,0
could tell from the literature it's not easy to predict who those people are going to be what is reassuring however is it does not seem to be the case that if you're somebody who experiences relief from headaches by drinking caffeine that suddenly one day to the next you're going to experience a worsening of your headache ,0
and vice versa is also true so if you're somebody that drinks caffeine and your headaches get worse I don't think there's any reason to think that caffeine one day or from one day to the next rather is going to somehow alleviate your headache so you have to determine for yourself whether or not headaches are relieved or exacerbated by ,0
drinking caffeine and if you're wondering why it's so confusing it's because caffeine hits both the vasodilation and the vasoconstriction Pathways and there's nothing you or I or anyone else can do about it now the last thing I'd like to talk about in terms of relief for headaches is something that I'm guessing about probably 25 percent ,0
of you are familiar with and 75 percent of you are not which is curcumin curcumin is often also referred to as turmeric and turmeric is a root and curcumin is one of the key components of that root curcumin is known to have very potent anti-inflammatory properties I don't think that's debated at all in fact it's so potent as an ,0
anti-inflammatory that some people have cautioned against taking high levels of curcumin prior to for instance resistance training workouts or even cardiovascular workouts because it so prevents inflammation that it also can prevent the adaptation response because remember the inflammation that occurs during exercise both resistance and ,0
cardiovascular exercise is at least in part the trigger for the adaptation that it's going to lead to enhanced endurance enhanced strength hypertrophy Etc nonetheless curcumin has been explored in the context of treatment of migraine and it's one of the compounds that was analyzed in extensive detail in this ,0
wonderful review that I mentioned a little bit earlier what I like about this study is that they were able to explore the effects of curcumin as explored in previous research studies and compare those across a large range of different dosages and a large range of combinations with other things like coenzyme Q10 which we've talked about on ,0
this podcast before but I think for sake of this discussion just really focusing on what curcumin does alone or in conjunction with the omega-3 fatty acids is what turns out to be the most interesting first of all curcumin has been shown to be generally safe for most people at dosages as high as 8 000 milligrams per day or eight grams per ,0
day now I want to be very clear I do not recommend that anyone take dosages of curcumin an AKA turmeric that are that high why well curcumin and turmeric not only are anti-inflammatory but they also can impinge on other Pathways in particular hormonal Pathways and in fact curcumin AKA turmeric can alter the synthesis of ,0
something called dihydrotestosterone dihydrotestosterone is involved in an enormous range of different bodily functions it's involved in libido it's involved in Men in beard growth and in the regulation of a number of different tissues both in the reproductive axis and outside the reproductive axis and curcumin is a potent inhibitor of DHT so ,0
I do want to caution that people who take high doses of curcumin and some people who are very sensitive to curcumin will even at low doses experience reductions in DHT that lead to things that they would not like such as sufficient reductions in libido however curcumin has been shown to be effective as an anti-inflammatory and ,0
has been shown to be very effective in treating different types of headache and particular migraine headache one of the ways in which curcumin does that is to inhibit this thing that I talked about a few minutes ago which is nitric oxide or no which causes vasodilation and in doing that can reduce the feeling that one has a lot of intracranial pressure ,0
okay so curcumin dosages come in enormous range as I mentioned before dosages that range anywhere from 80 milligrams taken 80 milligrams per day that is taken for eight weeks time that's been examined it's been explored at 80 milligram dosages taken alongside two and a half grams of omega-3 fatty acids or omega-3 ,0
fatty acids alone and against Placebo and the general conclusion of these studies is that curcumin when taken it at dosages of about 80 milligrams although for those of you very sensitive to curcumin probably as low as 25 or even 50 milligrams per day in conjunction with although not necessarily at the same ,0
time but taken daily alongside omega-3 fatty acids at two and a half grams per day led to significant improvements in migraine and other forms of headache meaning both the frequency and the intensity of the headaches that occurred was greatly reduced one important point about curcumin to keep in mind is that curcumin is known to ,0
inhibit something called cytochrome p450 that's associated with an enzymatic pathway and some other things that relate to blood coagulation so for people that are taking medications that are anticoagulants to prevent clotting you do need to be very cautious about using curcumin and of course with curcumin or any other supplement you ,0
should always talk to your doctor prior to including it or removing it from your supplement regimen so as you can see there are a number of different things that in addition to prescription drugs and over-the-counter pain medications things like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can really impact the different aspects of headache ,0
and different types of headache in some cases differentially now today we talked mainly about tension type and migraine type headaches because those are the most common forms of headache there are of course the cluster type headaches that are of neural origin talked about hormonal headaches and indeed some treatments such as Omega-3s which have ,0
been shown to be beneficial for offsetting the menstrual related headaches now in the context of the discussion about Omega-3s keep in mind that Omega-3s can be obtained from supplementation or from nutrition so you don't necessarily have to take omega-3 capsules or liquid form Omega-3s if you want to use Omega-3s to Target different ,0
symptoms of headache but that probably is going to be the most efficient way to do it given that many foods do contain Omega threes but it's hard to get above that one gram dosage and in fact most of the studies that we talked about today involved getting two or even two and a half or in some cases on this podcast with previous guests such as Dr Rhonda ,0
Patrick she talked about the advantages of getting as high as three grams of Omega-3s per day which almost with certainty is going to require some external form of supplementation even for those of you that are making a point to eat fatty ocean fish with the skin on so I just want to make sure that I highlight that before we wrap up I can't ,0
help myself but to talk about something that I heard about on the news several years ago and it sounded too outrageous to be true but then was confirmed as accurate by one of my neurologist colleagues that's the fact that eating certain very spicy peppers can induce headache and in some cases can induce brain damage and bear with me here I'm ,0
not talking about your traditional jalapeno and I'm acknowledging the fact that certain people can tolerate far more spicy taste case then do others some people are very sensitive to spicy some people can tolerate very spicy food and that one can build up a tolerance to spicy food by ingesting progressively your spicy or excuse me spicy or and ,0
spicier Foods over time nonetheless there are these Pepper eating contests out there that um while not very common do exist and people challenge each other to eat peppers of um extreme spiciness and there's one in particular that's referred to as the Carolina Reaper by the way that's not a person as far as I know that's a pepper ,0
the Carolina Reaper which is known to have the most potent spice of any pepper and here's why you would not want to eat the Carolina Reaper a few years ago at one of these Pepper eating contests man ate a Carolina Reaper as part of the competition and suddenly experience what's called Thunderclap headache Thunderclap headache is a unique type of ,0
headache very different from all the other types of headaches it is not from the surface in so it's not tension headache it's not even the cluster type headache of the nerve activation of the trigeminal it's actually a hyper constriction of the vasculature in the brain caused by the ingestion of the pepper and inflammatory response and ,0
remember that heat and spicy go together in these neural Pathways and a bunch of different heat related and spice related Pathways get activated simultaneously when one ingests something of extreme spice and the blood vessels and indeed some of the smaller arteries feeding neural tissue shut down and he experienced this Thunderclap headache ,0
which is a brutal headache and sadly in his case um permanent brain damage so loss of neuronal tissue because neuronal tissue is very metabolically active you cut off the blood supply to that tissue Not only would you feel miserable maybe even pass out but lose vision and certain brain areas will actually die off in the absence of blood flow to ,0
those areas we know this more commonly as stroke so I don't want to strike fear in anybody about eating a you know a jalapeno or even a very spicy meal from time to time but if you're not somebody who's familiar with eating very spicy foods you certainly don't want to enter one of these competitions and just realize that the pathways from Menthol ,0
and cool or spicy and hot those aren't just subjective Pathways these are actually neural Pathways that again originate in our so-called nerds call it the sensory epithelium so our skin our our hearing our eyes and that feed that information into the body to make use of that information some case motor movement so sensory motor in other cases ,0
the information can be fed through nerve Pathways that goes to the vasculature and causes the vasculature to either dilate or constrict these very spicy peppers causing as I just mentioned extreme cerebro of of the head of vasoconstriction and brain damage again that's not going to be a common thing out there but nonetheless I encourage ,0
people to be very cautious about the Carolina Reaper so today we talked about headaches and first we highlighted the different types of headache making it clear that understanding which headache you might be experiencing can be very beneficial for understanding which sorts of treatments ought to be best and perhaps also best avoided in ,0
trying to alleviate those headaches or prevent them from happening at all we talked about tension headaches migraine headaches hormone-based headaches cluster headaches and traumatic brain injury related headaches we talked about different types of treatments ranging from creatine to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation some herbal and indeed ,0
some essential oil treatments as well as acupuncture all of which have been shown to have significant impact in reducing the frequency and intensity of headaches and in many cases reductions in the frequency and intensity of headaches that are at least as great as the results they're seen with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs again I want to ,0
highlight that none of these approaches are necessarily designed to be done on their own or in replacement of prescription drugs from your physician there are excellent prescription drugs out there that your physician can prescribe for you for the treatment of headache nonetheless I think many people who are listeners of this podcast are ,0
interested in the things that they can do in order to inoculate themselves or at least reduce the likelihood of experiencing headache especially for people who are experiencing chronic recurring headaches such as migraine or the other forms of headache which can be so debilitating thank you for joining me for today's discussion if you're ,0

waking up requires that one to three degree re- increase in body temperature I've been sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover for the last six months or so now and I can assert that it is the absolute biggest Game Changer in the quality and duration of my sleep in fact I don't really like traveling as much as I used to because the eight sleep ,1
doesn't go with me and they don't seem to have them yet in airbnbs and hotels so this is also a call to action airbnbs and hotels please put eight sleep mattresses on your beds and I'll be more apt to stay in those hotels and airbnbs with that said if you'd like to try an eight-sleep mattress cover you can go to eightsleep.com huberman check out the ,1
fact that you're a nurse surgeon do for your view of the brain how do you think about and conceptualize the brain yeah the scope of neurosurgery is quite broad uh when I was in medical school I I was drawn to neurosurgery because of a procedure known as deep brain stimulation when I was at Penn as a college student I actually watched my ,1
impulsive sometimes these problems actually melt away and we're trying to help their Tremor but the patients also tell us that their gambling issue has gotten better or their mood has improved and why is that well you know there's probably more than one reason you know you can help somebody's Mood by making ,1
sneaking knock on Woods like in mid-exam and studying and pretty soon I was knocking on wood often I developed a superstition and so I'm curious about the role of superstition and compulsion in the crossover there it makes sense logically to me but I was equally shocked to learn that when I stopped taking this ,1
stimulation it's a a brief delivery of stimulation anywhere between 5 and 10 seconds that is intended to just disrupt the perturbed signaling that's happening in the nucleus accumbens there are disorders like depression let's say that I I would describe as a bit more of a state ,1
disorder and this is obviously oversimplified because we know that there's fluctuations in mood and depression as well so don't let me oversimplify it too much um but um but but for now let's forgive the oversimplification if we if we accept that depression is a state disorder or ,1
powerful it has its uh assumptions but um like anything in in science but we could actually map out where the nucleus accumbens connects to the prefrontal cortex sort of the cortical control inhibitory control pathway and where that pathway intersects with the nucleus accumbens and we can Target that area ,1
um structurally so those three goals of the surgery we we aim to set up to accomplish and we believed if we achieved two of those three that we would have a successful result in our in our early trial amazing given that at least to me the non-clination that anorexia is the ,1
condition I I relate with that I am trying over time to bridge what I'm doing in obesity and binging disorder to atorexia for two reasons one because I think these problems are more similar than they are different and two because of the need um and I think we're well positioned to sort of tackle anorexia ,1
clinicians to stimulate specific brain areas perhaps with more Precision um maybe you could just give us a coverage of what those are being used for what are your thoughts on on um uh these forms of non-invasive meaning no no flipping open of a piece of the skull type brain stimulation and blockade of brain activity sure yeah I wanted to ,1
clarify also these these surgeries generally don't um by the way require a full craniotomy it's usually just a small opening about the size of a dime in the bone so just just to clarify but that's painless too right uh well usually without pain yeah there's a little bit of scalp numbing we give a scalp block and the patients are ,1
depression I believe is uh similar to what's been approved for uh OCD but for addiction I believe it is a different Target but we'd have to ask our our TMS experts on that can they direct the transcranial magnetic stimulation deep below the cortex they try uh and we're we're actually studying this in OCD patients now ,1
um perhaps one day there will be a TMS Target for anorexia and obesity if we are scratching the surface with invasive approaches to these problems we we're even doing less with the brain stimulation um so we have so much work to do there eating disorders and TMS have been so um sort of scarcely studied or or there ,1
have been so such little research done in that in that space and so it is an area that we need to to work on um for the obvious reason for example in a patient with anorexia just thinking practically you know placing a device in a patient who is significantly underweight might not be the best approach you know wound erosion and ,1
incision I don't have to place an electrode into the brain to achieve a similar result how early into the pathology of Parkinson's can someone think about approaching this so for instance if somebody has a parent or a sibling and they're developing some resting Tremor yeah obviously they should talk to a neurologist but a ,1
um I actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton I I've observed uh Tremor in him and I think he's actually disclosed that he has it and I hoped he'd become a champion for for patients with a central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor does as well she's also public about it but I I was not able to get them eager to become ,1
without much regulation we've we've probed the brain um the problem we can't learn a lot from those experiments now uh well in this way at least we don't know exactly where those electrodes were we didn't have MRI scanning or high quality cat scanning to to know where those electrodes were with ,1
perhaps there becomes an ultrasound Target um but right now the approach is a bit more reversible because you can always shut that electrode off or even remove the electrode if perhaps it's not in the optimal location to treat the depression uh but actually after a large volume of cases perhaps they could pool that data ,1
levels of awareness at least for now until we have specific sites in the brain that we can Target non-invasive methods that could be deployed to millions and millions of people seems like that awareness seems like maybe among the best tools that people could develop yes 100 agree with you you know so for the person with OCD or uh who ,1
suffers from anorexia or binge eating disorder and to their clinicians you know I I just want to highlight that you said that I mean I'm not again I'm not a clinician I always say this I don't prescribe anything I profess things um and uh but awareness of one's thinking seems immensely powerful in this context yeah ,1
human novel study which I think will have a positive effect but it's still experimental uh they still can't stop themselves so there sort of as made aware as could possibly be did I use grammar there correctly I think so um they're as aware as they could possibly be and they still lose control ,1
we've had this studied in the lab so we will bring patients to the laboratory with this implanted device to to try to provoke this electrographic electrical signal that can be detected by the actual device that will stimulate them when they're at home but before we actually initiate stimulation we want us to see can this ,1
and even under video surveillance through a one day one-way mirror in a laboratory setting when patients are very well aware that their there to be studied if they're going to binge they still do and we believe they do because they just can't control it as aware as they are of it and it's probably because they're the ,1
neurosurgeons do around the country uh you know taking care of herniated discs and lumbar fusions so you know the scope is the entire central nervous system include including the peripheral nervous system we take care of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and nerve disorders ,0
now over the course of the past two decades or so there's been a a mission in the field to to sub-specialize and so historically neurosurgeons did everything in that domain but now we sub-specialize and I'm lucky to be at Penn Medicine where we can focus on one of these areas so I'm chief of stereotactic functional Neurosurgery ,0
all I do is deep brain stimulation surgery and a compliment to that is focus ultrasound or transcranial Focus ultrasound which is a non-invasive way to do an ablation in the brain recently FDA approved and it's FDA approved for Trevor at the moment uh these two procedures are for me my every day but uh still the minority of what ,0
neurosurgeons have to offer the majority of neurosurgery in my mind is is a bit more structural than it is physiology or deeply rooted in how the brain functions when we take out a brain tumor we have to find a a safe trajectory to get to the brain tumor and then we remove it and we help the patient recover in the ,0
ICU similar to a brain aneurysm often we don't have to go into the brain to clip a brain aneurysm but we go around the brain or under the brain to get there and in my mind those surgeries are a bit more structural deep brain stimulation the surgery that I do routinely is a procedure where yes there is structure involved of course we ,0
I'm Andrew huberman and I'm our professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine today's episode is the third in the sixth episode series on fitness exercise and performance today's episode is all about endurance and fat loss that is the specific protocols required to achieve the four different kinds of ,0
endurance and how to maximize fat loss Dr Andy Galpin great to be back today we're going to talk about endurance and I'm very interested in this conversation because I like many other people strive to get a certain amount of cardiovascular work in each week maybe a long-ish jog maybe a swim ride ,0
the bike Etc but when I think about the word endurance the idea that almost immediately comes to mind is about doing something for a long period of time repeatedly but I have a feeling that there are other ways to trigger this adaptation that we call the endurance adaptation so I'm excited to learn about ,0
that I'm also excited to learn about the fuel systems in the body that allow for endurance and other modes of repeated activity so in order to kick things off I'd love for you to frame the conversation by telling us what is endurance and are there indeed a large variety of ways to induce what we ,0
call this endurance adaptation sure the way I want to start actually here is is calling back to some of the things we talked about our previous conversations which are really people exercise for three reasons number one you want to feel better number two you want to look a certain way and then number three you want to be ,0
able to do that for a long time right so you need the way that we say it in sports is look good feel good play good right so I want some sort of functionality to be able to perform a certain way whatever that is for you you want to be able to look a certain way that whatever that matters for you and then you want to be able to do that for ,0
a long time so when it comes to endurance we have a bunch of misnomers here which is the same thing with the strength training and resistance exercise side where we wanted to dispel this myth that I lift weights only because I I want to gain muscle or play a sport and I want to do cardio because I want to leave ,0
their loose fat or for long Health sake and just like we smashed that myth from the strength training side I want to smash it from the endurance training side there are so many other reasons that you want to perform endurance training regardless of your goal right whether it is longevity whether it is performance ,0
or whether it is Aesthetics and so we're gonna I want to cover all those reasons uh exactly what to do Protocols of course and why those things are working that way in general though the quick answer is really endurance comes down to two independent factors Factor number one is fatigue management and then Factor ,0
number two is fueling and that's all it really comes down to so all the different types of training are going to reach a limitation which are either again your ability to deal with some sort of fatigue and that's generally a fatigue signal the other one is managing some sort of restriction of energy input and a lot of the spoiler ,0
here is a lot of the times people think it's a fueling issue and really it's a fatigue management issue or the opposite and to have a complete Health Spectrum regardless of whether you're a high performance athlete like I typically deal with or general public you need to be able to do both manage fatigue as well as understand fuel storage so ,0
that's really what we're going to get into today fantastic I can't wait before we dive in I'm going to ask you what I often ask people who are expert in their respective fields which is is there any non-obvious tool or mechanism or tool end mechanism that can allow people to access better endurance you know when I think about training for endurance again ,0
I think about trying to run longer and longer each week yeah or Swim further and further and so on but I do wonder whether or not there are other forms of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation that I or most people perhaps don't think of as endurance sure the way I want to answer this is if we look back ,0
and think about how we've answered that question with power and strength in force production it is really about how much can you produce maximally once what you're asking now is how can I repeat that same quality of performance if that's the case endurance really comes down to your ability to maintain ,0
proper mechanics that's going like the biggest way we can and increase your endurance exponentially very quickly is mechanical and this is starting with breathing and so we need to be breathing properly we need to have proper posture and positions and then we need to be moving well efficiency is going to Trump Force ,0
always for endurance the other side of the equation is not that you can have a little bit of leaks in your mechanics and still squat well or jump high and be fine because you don't have to suffer those consequences repeatedly right that's going to drain you over time so the quickest way to ,0
improve endurance is to improve mechanics and the mechanical thing I would go after first is your breathing techniques your pattern your entire approach as well as your posture and then from there the third one would be your movement technique is it possible to describe the best way to breathe when doing an endurance training or is it far ,0
more complex than that and if it is far more complex than that then certainly we can get into it during today's episode yeah it is both of those I will give you a quick answer though a lot of the times you can kind of Hit the cheat code which is nasal breathing there's plenty of times when you don't want to nasal breathe you ,0
don't need your nasal breathe but just again is that like a one tool that is a for a pretty General answer if you can do that a lot of the times that will fix breathing mechanics just by default and we can maybe talk about why that is later but that would be my sort of one sentence bullet point answer immediately of how to get in the right positions the ,0
second one would be simply looking at your posture right so whether you're on a bike or you're doing a lift or you're running if you're literally uh hunched over and your ribs are touching your femur or getting closer and closer like tends to happen on a bike or an air assault thing for somebody I've seen recently this morning I was on the ,0
assault bike um doing a Sprint and I asked Andy Dr Galpin to critique my form and anything else he wanted to critique so that I could improve and he did comment on my rather c-shaped posture correct um encouraging me to be more upright which I should probably do now as well and he also cued me to the fact that during a one minute Sprint there is ,0
something that is quote unquote magic that happens right about the 42nd Mark and I use that as a um as a milestone uh to look for and indeed something does happen at the 42nd it's into a one minute Sprint where all of a sudden it it does seem to get much easier for reasons I don't understand maybe you can to tell it that but it ,0
certainly had nothing to do with my posture my posture needs Improvement thank you well yeah so um breathing mechanics and breathing strategies uh people tend to be over breathing early on and this is going to lead to problems later so having a more strategic breathing pattern and approach is again a very quick solution I know ,0
that we're going to dive very deep into the mechanisms of Energy and Metabolism and endurance today but as long as we're having a discussion about these um briefs or tidbits of how to improve endurance are there any other ways to improve endurance that that are of relatively short time investment even if they require a lot of um energy ,0
sure the classic Paradigm you're going to find here is steady state long duration posed up against what a lot of folks will now call higher intensity interval training specifically and there's a lot of misconceptions here the quick answer is you need to be doing both and there's probably a bunch of stuff in between ,0
that you should be practicing if you honestly want to maximize those three factories we talked about at the beginning you need to be training across this full spectrum just like I told you to train across the full spectrum of your lifting we want to be doing the same thing here so are there independent special factors that can happen with the ,0
shorter time length higher intensity stuff absolutely there's also magic that happens on the other end of that Spectrum so it's very important that people don't just choose one side because what tends to happen is people either go with the oh I'm going to do 30 or 45 minutes of steady state stuff that's it or I'm gonna do the opposite ,0
which I'm going to leave that stuff on the table not do it because I only want to do high intensity intervals because I can get it done in five minutes so there's Magic on both sides of the equation we want to get into all that but just to answer your question directly there's a whole bunch of of things you ,0
can do um in under one minute that are convenient to do and there's a wonderful set of papers out of a couple Laboratories in Canada that that championed this idea that's called exercise snacks so there's a bunch of there's a series of studies that have been done here that are really ,0
interesting and they've looked at a couple of things that are noteworthy one of them is a 20-second bout of all out work and this is actually done in workers in an office and so what they have them do is run upstairs and I believe it was about 60 steps is what it took them something along the order of 20 seconds exactly and they repeated ,0
that about once every four hours so really it's you go to work you get you know put your coffee and your bag down whatever you run up a flight of stairs 20 seconds later then you go right back to work at lunch and before you go home you sort of repeat it there and if you repeat that that's multiple times a week you're going to do that I ,0
think they in one of the interventions it was three times a week for six weeks 18 total times you did that and what you'll see is a noticeable Improvement this is statistically significant improvements in cardiorespiratory Fitness specifically VO2 max as well as a number of cognitive ,0
benefits work productivity Etc that can happen in as little as 20 seconds you don't have to go to the gym you don't have to shower you don't have to do anything like that just find the stairs run up and down them a few times now you may have noticed um you actually sort of caught me yesterday I did that right here right I was just I we had a ,0
little bit of a break I was feeling an energy lull I ran up the stairs three or four times felt a lot better so that can actually also help they ran another study where they looked at that following a giant high glycemic index meal and what they saw and then they took insulin measures and a whole bunch of ,0
um other biological markers Associated that you want to pay attention to the high glycemic index meal and they looked at those immediately an hour three hours six hours as opposed and it was very clear that same intervention was able to improve post-planned yell glucose control insulin and a whole bunch of other factors in addition to that so if ,0
you are the sort of type who's like wow I'm in an office all day maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal not the best approach but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up a flight of stairs or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds so there's a lot of magic and power and maximal exertion ,0
if one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work could they do jumping jacks absolutely I mean you could do anything you really wanted it's not the mode of exercise that matters here it is simply the exertion you just get up as hard as you can you could do burpees you could do any number of things you could Sprint down your road down the hallway ,0
back and forth the mode is is just uh something that was easy for the scientists to control and X number of steps people could do it you're not going to fall hurt yourself things like that just to remind me it's once every four hours one minute of all 20 seconds oh 20 seconds excuse me uh 20 seconds of essentially all out exertion yep while ,0
remaining safe not going so fast up the stairs or doing jumping jacks certainly not down the stairs up the stairs please um escalators don't count well I suppose they count if they're uh you know if you're if you're moving uh if you're not remaining on the same steps um in fact in an airport recently I saw ,0
somebody walking against the oh there you go the conveyor yeah while talking on the phone while waiting for their flight to take off and I thought it's genius right it looked a little awkward who cares yeah but it was I have looked awkward in every airport I've been in for the last 15 years for those exact reasons doing wild stuff like that yeah ,0
well nothing's more Awkward than not being able to walk to the end of the terminal simply because one isn't familiar with walking that far carrying a couple of suitcases there you go yeah that's the the other fit test the suitcase carrier yeah I'm in the airport I love this so once every four hours 20 seconds so maybe once when arriving to ,0
work once four hours in and then four hours most people probably work somewhere you know eight plus or minus two hours now one thing I actually really want to make clear because your audience is so incredible um they tend to be really excited about these protocols and they follow them ,0
exactly as written that's not exactly how science works so it doesn't necessarily have to be every four hours it's in half three three times a day it doesn't have to be 20 seconds they literally built that protocol because it was so they're trying to replicate a real life scenario maybe you're in an office building you're generally there ,0
for eight hours Let's see if you did one every sort of so if you want to do it four times a week great if you can do it only 10 seconds amazing you're probably going to get the same benefits those are not the details to pay attention to the detail to pay attention to is every so often multiple times a day try to get your heart rate up really ,0
quickly it doesn't require sweating doesn't require anything else there's no warm-up associated with it again you need a minute break in between meetings or whatever and you can Sprint up them I do this all the time in my house when you you know have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms Etc you can get out of 20 seconds I run ,0
to my garage which is over there I hop on the the airbike and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in love it yeah I'm gonna start yeah just also you can just put one of those things which I do also just put one in your office and hop over right over there you know ,0
the whole entire thing now literally takes 23 seconds before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is also separate from Dr Andy galpin's teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton it is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer ,0
information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is momentous momentous makes supplements of the absolute highest quality the huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering with momentous for several important reasons first of ,0
all as I mentioned their supplements are of extremely high quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you're going to develop a supplementation protocol you're going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most ,0
logical and effective and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the huberman Lab podcast listeners reside outside the United States if you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned on the huberman ,0
Lab podcast in particular supplements for Hormone Health for Sleep optimization for Focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery you can go to live momentous spelled ous so that's livemomentis.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by levels levels is a program that lets you see ,0
how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor many people are aware that their blood sugar that is their blood glucose level is critical for everything from Fat Loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body most ,0
people do not know however how different foods and different activities including exercise or different temperature environments impact their blood glucose levels and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things I first started using levels about a year ago as a way to understand and how different foods exercise and ,0
timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood glucose levels and I've learned a tremendous amount from using levels it's taught me when best to eat what best to eat when best to exercise how best to exercise and how to modulate my entire schedule from work to exercise and even my sleep so if you're interested in ,0
learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself go to levels.link huberman that's levels dot link slash huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium to optimize cellular functioning for mental ,0
and physical performance most people realize that hydration is key we need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best and perform our best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ,0
ratio goes now of course people with pre-hypertension and hypertension need to be careful about their sodium intake but what a lot of people don't realize is that if you drink caffeine if you exercise and in particular if you're following a very clean diet that is not a lot of processed foods which of course is a good thing chances are you're not ,0
getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science-backed ratio of 1 000 milligrams that's one gram of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element that's lmnt.com huberman to get a free ,0
element sample pack with your purchase again that's drink element lmnt.com huberman to claim a free sample pack so tell me about endurance what is endurance how do I get more endurance and how does it work when we think about endurance I would like to open up the conversation to include more things than people ,0
generally do when they hear the word endurance so if we just think about what you typically ask your body to do or would like to ask your body to do and we just walk through them it's going to be things like this number one I want to have energy throughout the day that's actually a form of endurance great I don't want to have these lulls ,0
and fatigue and I want to feel fantastic as I move throughout my activities of daily living whatever those may be work exercise enjoyment paying attention focus all that stuff great that's one thing another thing you want to ask your body to do is I want to be able to repeat some small effort in a muscle group and ,0
not and feel great about that this is what we generally call muscular endurance so this is something like I want to be able to walk up those 10 flights of steps and my quads aren't burning at the end of it right or it even gives me energy another thing you'll want to ask your body to do is to be able to perform a tremendous amount ,0
of work for a longer period of time something in the realm of you know 20 to 80 seconds so this could be something like if you're surfing and you've got to paddle extremely hard for a minute to get on on top of a wave or you want to you got you're out riding your bike and you need to be able to get up a hill and it's a ,0
very Steep Hill these are going to take maximal efforts for some small amount of time and then you'll get back up there we tend to call that maximum anaerobic capacity so that the max amount of work you can perform at a higher rate for some amount of seconds to like maybe a minute past that is your ability to repeat an ,0
effort kind of like that for something like 5 to 15 minutes and this example would be run a mile right some some interval like that which is a longer distance right that is going to be your maximum aerobic capacity okay another thing you're going to want your body to do is we call sustained position ,0
so this is you want to be able to sit in your chair at work and have perfect posture for 20 30 40 minutes right you want to be able to stand in line at a grocery store for 15 minutes and not have a breakdown in posture so you want to be able to maintain position when you're riding your bike you're not collapsing you're doing any of these ,0
activities and you don't get hurt or lose efficiency simply because you couldn't sustain basic positions all right whatever those shapes and positions need to be okay and then the last one is a maximum distance so you won't be able to go for a longer hike or have just a long day at Disneyland for whatever it needs to be ,0
and feel great at the end of it right so the goal with all of these things is not can you just do them but can you do them and then you feel good afterwards so we're back in a right position where they give you energy you feel good about it and it's not just something you had to do and you regretted and you felt awful so those are the factors I think ,0
about when someone says I want better endurance is I want to walk backwards and say okay when you say endurance what do you mean and that's generally the things I've come across as if you can handle all of those things you're going to feel like you're in fantastic shape you're going to feel your recovery is going to be excellent and your physical ,0
performance in the gym or in any of the sporting activities you do will be enhanced given what you told us a little bit earlier that endurance really reflects fatigue and management and energy production how do each and both of those things relate to endurance at a mechanistic level so really what I'm asking is what ,0
is fatigue management and what is energy production in order to do that it's important that we understand all of those functional capacities that I just talked about they all have different points of failure okay so in order to then work backwards and say well how do I optimize my ,0
performance in all those categories we need to go through each one and figure out where am I failing some of them are going to be failing because of fatigue management and some of them will be failing because of energy production issues so if we walk through a little bit of how we make energy and how we handle fatigue then we're going to have ,0
a better understanding of exactly what to do for each one of these categories if you feel like one of them in particular is worse for you or lagging behind or if in general you just want to improve all of them all right now I want to make a little bit of a 90 degree turn here I'm going to do it with strategy though ,0
I promise and I want to ask you a very simple question how do you lose weight I was taught that the calories in calories out thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything that is if I'm ingesting less caloric energy than I burn ,0
then I'm going to lose weight and if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn I'll maintain weight and if I ingest more then I burn then I'll gain weight sure that is the approach you would take what I'm asking really is how are you actually physically losing the weight so my understanding is that we have ,0
different fuel sources in the body glycogen which is stored in muscle and liver body fat which is sort of mainly white adipose tissue and which is subcutaneous and around our organs intra visceral fat and that we can also use protein as a fuel and then as I recall there's also a phosphocreatine system and I think ,0
you're going to tell me that each of these systems is tapped into on different time scales and perhaps according to different levels of exertion and I'm certain that what I just said is not exhaustive but hopefully it is most or entirely correct pretty correct what's that got to do with fat loss ,0
at some point body fat stores adipose adipocytes fat cells are going to start liberating fat as a fuel source and the stimulus for that I'm assuming is going to be that other fuel sources are either depleted or that the energy and metabolic systems of the body I don't want to say decide because they don't have their own Consciousness but ,0
are um our flip signals are signaling in a way that registers that body fat would be the optimal fuel source given how long or into and or intensely a given activity has been performed okay we have some stuff to clean up there but we're still not really answering the question how am I actually losing that body fat ,0
uh how is it actually leaving the body correct uh my understanding is that it leaves the body through respiration aha so now we have some interesting things to talk about how am I actually losing fat via respiration what the hell does that even mean how is something that occupied this physical space on the side of me leaving ,0
my body through my mouth and that is a very clear answer there right which I'm sure you're queued up to when you take a breath in you're generally breathing in oxygen O2 that's some other things but we'll just stick to oxygen when you exhale you're breathing out CO2 the difference between those two is that carbon molecule well ,0
one of the things that's important to understand here is all of your carbohydrates which is that word itself is a carbon that has been hydrated so it is a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule it is a simple chain of carbons your fat molecules are also chains of carbon all of metabolism really in terms of energy production is simply trying to ,0
figure out a way to break those carbon bonds as a result we get energy from that we use that energy to create a molecule called ATP which is the central source of energy for any living being right that carbon is then floating around in free form which is bad news internally so we've got to figure out a way to get that carbon out of our system ,0
so all of energy production all of fatigue management really comes down to this core issue of how are we handling carbon and how are we moving it around the body and so what we do is we do this sneaky thing so another question I'd like to ask people is why do we breathe well for two reasons uh to bring oxygen into ,0
the system and to offload carbon dioxide but the neural trigger for breathing is when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level and the set of neurons in the brain stem and elsewhere uh activate the phrenic nerve or the gas reflex or a combination of things and we inhale or inhale right so a reduction of oxygen intake generally doesn't stimulate ,0
ventilation unless you're at altitude then that sort of changes right in general it's an elevation in CO2 that's going to stimulate breathing off the only reason you bring in O2 for the most part is to get rid of the CO2 oxygen is not a fuel source it is not a way and it works the same with fire by the way so you know you ,0
have to have oxygen present for a fire to go and if you use quelch oxygen the fire will go out right that's about half of um how those like fire extinguishers work but we think then that means oxygen is the fuel it is not the fuel it is something entirely different it is a necessary Pro it is a product that is ,0
necessary for the metabolism process to actually occur all right so we're kind of dancing around an idea here which is this carbon cycle of life so what happens in plants is they generally will breathe in the opposite and breathe out the opposite of humans so a plant will breathe in CO2 and exhale O2 all right this is why we have ,0
to have a certain amount of these things and algae and forests and trees and stuff to maintain this O2 CO2 balance in our atmosphere we do the opposite so we have this wonderful circle of life we breathe in O2 breathe out CO2 they do the opposite well what happens is because carbohydrates are long chains of carbon and fats are as well generally ,0
when we think about fats by the way it's important to understand that structure a little bit so if we think about triglycerides it is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol so one two three and horizontally running off of each one of those are fatty acid chains right so we form this structure that looks like an e right like the letter e ,0
three in the back and then three chains coming off of it each of those chains are called fatty acids and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon right or a number of carbons strung together however many carbons are there determines which type of fatty acid it is right so stearic acid linoleic acid like any different number of things it's ,0
also what determines whether or not it is a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated as if carbon requires a special thing called a double bond so if there's a double bond across every carbon and carbon then they're all fully saturated and you're great if there's any of them that are not double bonded and in fact an example if there is one that doesn't ,0
have a double bond that is now called Mono and saturated if there are many it is called polyunsaturated so there's pros and cons to all these things right in either case we're still talking long carbon chains so what a plant will do is bring in carbon and then it has this wonderful ability to use energy from the ,0
sun called photosynthesis and it can take those carbons that it inhales and use the energy from the Sun to form a bond now in our prior discussion when we're going over hypertrophy we talked about the energy that was required to go through protein synthesis that's because forming a new atom or a new bond between atoms oftentimes takes energy in this ,0
cases it does the same thing happens here so if a plant does not have oxygen or does not have carbon dioxide in the air it has no fuel the basically think about it is that's what it eats it needs to get nitrogen from the ground in the soil just like we need to get nitrogen from our protein but fuel wise it needs to get carbon dioxide then it needs sun ,0
to give it energy so it can actually form that Bond right that's what it's getting its fuel from all right so if we think about um a classic uh plant produce the plant that produces either a starch or a fruit here's what happens it inhales that carbon and it starts ,0
packing it away now in a root vegetable what it does is it stores those things together and if we store that thing and we grow fruit at the bottom of it we tend to call those things starches all right it's going to then take the carbon that is packed away in its root and send it up the tree and it's going to actually do that by breaking it down ,0
into a smaller form of carbohydrate that we tend to often call things like sucrose and glucose it'll ship that up the tree it'll go out to the leaves and it'll convert it into the fruit and it's going to eventually transform that stuff into smaller carbon things called fructose and if we think about the fruit are the sugar in fruit it's often in the ,0
form of fructose or sucrose or a combination and sometimes glucose so we have these smaller carbon six carbon chains generally in the form of glucose that are being made from this larger storage of uh carbohydrates that we call um starch right so it's packed in together your body does the exact same thing so ,0
if it's a potato and it has a whole bunch of glucose packed away we call that starch if it's in your quadricep and we pack about a whole bunch of glucose Away We Now call it glycogen if it's in your blood as that six carbon chain we call it glucose if it's in the tree and in the fruit we call it fructose right ,0
those are different molecules but that's effectively the same thing happens so the biology or the chemistry is almost identical it just runs in the reverse order and that's why again at tubers and potatoes and stuff tend to be starches and fruits tend to be glucose fructose of sucrose so we have this a wonderful Circle of Life the plants ,0
can survive on just breathing in the CO2 and then getting the energy from the Sun we don't have that ability at least to my knowledge to run through photosynthesis so the only way we can get carbon into our system is to actually ingest carbon which means we have to eat the starch the fruit the animal some other form of stored ,0
carbon to get that into our system we then pack that away we put the carbohydrates as you mentioned earlier either on our liver our blood or in our muscles we put the fat generally in adipose tissue we'll put a little bit in muscle cells as intramuscular triglycerides and then the protein will use as structure right to ,0
do different things we don't like to use protein as material or fuel it's better used as structure and what we have to do then is if all of a sudden we realize that storage is getting too much in our body in other words we're gaining too much weight we have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body and that is metabolism right anytime ,0
we're trying to break a carbon bonds though we can get energy to make ATP that's going to release the carbon out of our tissue into the blood we have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon molecule to make CO2 so we can exhale it and put it back into the atmosphere it's a beautiful description of the circle of life and ,0
energy utilization in the human body I have to ask the question that I'm sure many people are wondering about which is if indeed we exhale these carbons and as it relates to Fat Loss that is the way that we lose fat if we're in a sub caloric state for instance has it ever been explored as to whether increasing the duration or intensity of ,0
exhales can accelerate fat loss I mean that's sort of The Logical extension of what you described and here I'm actually interested equally in whether or not the answer is yes as well as whether it could be no because I could imagine if the answer is yes well then there's some interesting protocols to emerge from that but that if it's no it will reveal ,0
to us some important bottlenecks about metabolism and energy utilization you ever seen those magicians who like show up and uh they can tell your mom's name or something like that before you because they can sort of hold you down a path yeah I mean not to take us down a deep dive tangent but I once went to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles and I was ,0
one of the people called up front and a in an incredible magician a named um I think his name was Ozzy mind or something uh I think that's right had me write my name on a card in a Sharpie pen I ripped up the card I ripped it up I put it in my pocket and at the end of the 10 or 15 minute bout of him doing a bunch of other ,0
tricks he asked me to look in my right shoe and under my foot in my right shoe was that card intact yeah and it was no longer in my pocket and I swear in my life I wasn't a a collaborator with him and to this day it still gives me chills because it well I I don't know how magic yeah right magic well the reason I say ,0
that is I've given that little Spiel and I just gave you the countless times on my glasses and I would say 99 of the time as soon as I stop the very first question is so can I just like do a bunch of exhales and lose fat which is wonderful because I was really hoping you would do that and you rolled right ,0
into my trap right you landed perfectly so I look like a like a a magician over here I feel like I should look in my right shoe right now no I asked the question because it's the logical extension of what you laid out but I know biology to be um both uh diabolical and cryptic but also Exquisite in the way that things are ,0
arranged and you don't get something for nothing there are no free passes in physiology that's the saying no free passes the answer to your question is yes 100 yes in fact that is the only way to go about it you have two options you can ingest less carbon or you can expel more carbon people always say calories in ,0
calories out it's really carbon in carbonate that's what a calorie is Right calories the amount of energy we get per breaking a carbon Bond so it's really Less in less more out less in is fairly obvious whether that comes in any form and by the way this is exactly why the percentage of ,0
your intake coming from fats or carbohydrate it doesn't really matter that much if you look at fat loss clinical trials you guys may have covered this when Lane was in here I'm sure like this is something he talks about a lot it doesn't matter it's irrelevant because it's not about that there's nothing magic in those things ,0
they are different they have different physiological responses everything is different right no duh but in general it's just simply about carbon intake turns out fat has a lot more carbons per mole than carbohydrates do so there's more calories per mole in there so if you the physical amount of fat needs to come in as a smaller amount physical ,0
amount of carbohydrates these are coming it will come in as a larger amount but you can play any number of very high carb low fat what matters total calories right again it's not like the only thing that matters but you know what I'm saying some percentages in the way can go fat loss Works fantastic high fat low ,0
carbohydrate why why do all these things work because that's not about that it's about total intake of carbon total Expo so absolutely can you lose fat by simply exhaling more in fact that is exactly what you did this morning when I hopped on the airline bike when you did anything right the question is can you think of a ,0
scenario in which you could have a bunch of increased rates of exhalation that helps in Fat Loss sure I can think of a lot of things that will stimulate increased rates of exhalation one thing could be simply going right and so the question is like can I literally do some breath protocols where I force exhale and lose fat and the ,0
answer is yes but what happens what happens if you do hyperventilation training well my lab studies cyclic hyperventilation is one of our many uh deliberate protocols and one of the most prominent things that one observes is that levels of adrenaline increase very quickly extremely quick people feel jittery ,0
anxious stressed and unless they are consciously trying to Anchor their thinking about what that means and the benefits that to persisting typically they abort the cyclic hyperventilation protocol really quickly within seconds right you will feel tingling sweating all kinds of things you're hyperventilating right and we could we ,0
could talk a nauseam about how that changes everything from adrenaline to focus to a whole bunch of things so unfortunately a strategy of sitting around just exhaling more than you inhale technically helps you lose more fat but it's not going to last very long so then the question is well how do I get no ,0
situation or scenario in which I can increase my rate of expiration where I'm not going to pass out I'm not going and altering hypocapny and hypercapnia issues any idea of a situation in which you would have an enhanced rate of explanation without worrying about passing out ,0
sure a steady state exercise or not steady state exercise lifting weights intervals moderate training repeated any of these things they all work equally for fat loss because all they're doing is increasing respiration rate they're saying increased demand for energy increased exhalation that's the trick here and when you ,0
equate these things to that they have equal success in fat loss it doesn't matter theoretically where you're getting it from and so when we get into this idea of well what are the best training strategies for fat loss it doesn't matter which one of these tactics you pick ,0
as long as you maintain a consistent adherence over time because of this exact fact it doesn't matter if you're burning quote unquote fat in the exercise session or if you're burning carbohydrates in the exercise session it is totally irrelevant to your net fat loss over time okay now there's some significant misconceptions there ,0
about what I just talked and I would love to come back and walk through that in more detail but that's the main take-home message here it won't matter what's coming in and it won't matter what's coming out because in either case it is the same rate of oxygen in and CO2 out that's the key metric and hopefully this helps a lot of ,0
people have some relief because they're like man you're so tied up on what is the exact protocol for training for optimizing fat loss what's the exact nutritional intervention I need for fat loss and then you wonder why all these different diets can work effectively and wonder why all these different training protocols you know surely you know ,0
somebody who lost a bunch of weight and the only thing they did is they just started running there was no Advanced protocol they just started running and they ran five miles every day that works and then tons of people who tried that and like didn't lose anything and lots of people who went to I went to cardio kickboxing ,0
class lost weight oh I just started doing intervals on my law why why mysteriously you'll do all these things work they had you have something had some spidey sense have to has to be going off in your brain where like there has to be something linking these things and what's linking it is simply carbon ,0
Exchange so put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling more than you and inhaling without passing out the other problem is if you were to Simply do a breathing protocol while the rate of exhalation would go up after that you would correct and go in the opposite direction so that's the ,0
problem is your net carbon the output over the course today is not going to change unless you increase the demand for energy and that's how you get into that negative state along these lines of exhaling carbons as the route for fat loss it makes me wonder whether or not increasing lung capacity is possible I'm ,0
guessing the answer is yes and whether or not increasing lung capacity is a good goal and route to enhancing fat loss essentially what I'm asking is if you can offload more CO2 okay carbons per exhale are you a more efficient fat loss machine it's a wonderful thought and the ,0
answer would be no not something you worry about because if you were to Exhale more carbon than actually needed now we're in a state of inefficiency you're burning way more energy than needed to do your activity the heart has a metric called cardiac output this is in Sciences we abbreviate this as Q ,0
for some odd reasons it's either seal or q and cardiac output is heart rate multiplied by stroke volume so it's how many beats per minute you're having as well as how much blood's coming out of it so cardiac output is actually very specific to energy needs if you try to work around that it's just going to ,0
adjust itself so what I mean by this is if you were able to increase your stroke volumes the amount of blood coming out per pump you would automatically adjust reduce your heart rate so that you keep cardiac output exact to energetic demands so you're sort of pushing one end of this of the spectrum but your body will pull the ,0
other one back to keep you at that exact same neutral level so if you look at if you think about like cardiovascular adaptations to endurance training and any type of endurance training a common thing people will understand is resting heart rate and so what that number is is just how many beats per minute you're having when you're sitting here doing ,0
nothing a very positive adaptation is a lowering of that resting rate over time as general numbers what you will hear is people will say things like a normal resting heart rate is between 60 to 80 beats per minute and you know if any of the things I've talked about um with the individuals I work with I don't work with anybody with disease ,0
just to clarify that I don't do anything with disease management treatment anything it's always about people who are in a good spot who want to optimize or get to the next level whether this is professional athletes trying to to Peak for physical performance or uh the folks in our rapid Health optimization program that feel ,0
good again it's not disease stuff and they want to feel incredible one of the metrics we're going to pay attention to is this resting heart rate so here's what happens as you improve your endurance your resting heart rate will go down if I see somebody over 70 beats per minute um unless something's going on you're ,0
not physically fed regardless of whether or not that is quote unquote within the normative values I want to see everybody's sub 60 beats per minute or close right and that does not a difficult thing to really get to for most people so if you train a lot regardless of how you train intervals steady state ,0
doesn't matter that resting heart rate will come down but since energy demands at rest haven't really changed cardiac Alpha stays the same so what happens is stroke volume goes up so literally like we trained your quadriceps on the Legacy engine machine to get stronger so you can produce more Force per contraction the heart will do the exact same thing ,0
and so as you're able to get more of the blood out of your heart per pump the heart realizes I don't need to pump as often so that's the compensatory adaptation which is saying hey look I don't need to beat 60 times a minute I now need to beat 55 times a minute because I'm getting the same amount of Blood Out per ,0
pump chill and this is why your resting heart rate goes down your resting stroke volume goes up but your cardiac output is identical so that's not a good metric of Fitness it's going to stay the same cardiac output will only adjust for energetic changes all right energy requirements in the acute moment right how much do I need go which is going to ,0
be determined by ventilation right how much air am I bringing in and putting out that's going to determine cardiac output and that's going to determine where we're at if you were to do like a sub maximal exercise test when you were unfit to when you're fit or when you're fit the way you're super fit at sub Max you're going to see the ,0
same thing cardiac output will be identical and you're like damn nothing happened what you're not realizing is your heart rate at that same workload is now lower and that's efficiency because your stroke volume is higher where it gets people tripped up is at Max because you may not see much of a change ,0
at Max because you won't really you don't really see an increase in maximum heart rate with Fitness that's not a thing right so maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for fit or unfit or anything like that stroke volume will get limited eventually by filling capacity of your heart it has to have so much time to fill up with blood before ,0
it can contract again and squeeze the blood out and when you have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute that just doesn't leave much time to fill and so it won't really push you past that so don't worry about trying to increase your maximum heart rate that's not necessarily a good thing and it won't really change but your cardiac health ,0
will because stroke volume will be higher but that doesn't necessarily mean that I should avoid training that gets me up toward maximal heart rate correct oh you should absolutely do it right that's what that was my assumption I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens athletic greens is a vitamin mineral ,0
probiotic and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking athletic greens daily since 2012. so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me meet all of my ,0
foundational nutritional needs that is it covers my vitamins my minerals and the probiotics are especially important to me athletic greens also contains adaptogens which are critical for recovering from stress from exercise from work or just general life if you'd like to try athletic greens you can go to athleticgreens.com huberman to claim ,0
a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin d3k2 again if you'd like to try athletic greens go to athleticreens.com huberman to claim the special offer getting back to energy production and metabolism so we've got these different modes of moving energy but making and breaking ,0
energy Bonds in the body moving energy into different tissues and out of different tissues and indeed out of the body through exhalation how do each of these different modes of energy utilization relate to different modes of movement and exercise yeah in my mind I'm starting to draw a bridge between ,0
okay when I walk for 60 minutes you know if I'm talking I'm breathing a bit more maybe I'm burning a little more fat after all speech is a modified exhale um and amazing if I'm sprinting um breathing differently and if I'm um you know doing a 30 minute moderate quote unquote moderate jog breathing ,0
differently so you've beautifully Illustrated this bridge between energy production and utilization and carbon dioxide offload through exhalation what are some of the specifics about energy utilization according to different modes of exercise and if we could better Define modes of exercise or types of exercise that ,0
trigger specific adaptations I think this is where the the bridge will move from being a a mere line to a real structure yeah absolutely I want to lay one more foundational piece and then it's going to be much easier to understand the limitations I put on some of these training protocols as well as the lack ,0
of limitations okay so it's really really important the way I want to start this is we have this this Foundation now of of carbon and and basic energy production that's not to say there's no difference there is and that difference is important but maybe we can answer the question from earlier which is ,0
actually something you asked me this morning when we were exercising you're like training fasted right does training fasted enhance fat loss and the logic is sound if I don't have any fuel then I should be burning more fat therefore I should be losing more fat it's sound it's not true ,0
is this great idea it's one of these classic things in science and exercise physiology where like sounds good turns out it's not it's actually a pretty gross misunderstanding of metabolism so it's not to pick on that topic I don't really care about that topic but it is a it's a common question it also ,0
gives me an opportunity to just tell you more about metabolism so here's what happens you're breathing in O2 and breathing out CO2 however the ratio to that is what we call the either rer respiratory exchange ratio or RQ respiratory quotient and I'm not going to differentiate those two they're not the same thing but we're ,0
going to skip past that for now as you begin to increase exercise intensity the percentage of o2 to CO2 rises in the favor of CO2 so you start breathing out way more CO2 than you are breathing in O2 right and so if we were to look at that number you know once the relationship Echoes up so at rest most people have a of a value that we would ,0
typically call something like 0.6 okay and that's again the relationship between O2 and CO2 maybe 0.7 if you were to go for a walk that increases slightly because you're now expiring CO2 at a higher rate so now you've moved up to say 0.8 or something like that one of the ways that we Mark somebody of achieving an actual VO2 max ,0
on a test is if that value exceeds 1.1 now any of you who are paying attention are thinking wait a minute how the hell can a ratio between two things ever get past one well that's because you're getting in a place where you're actually offloading more CO2 than is actually necessary and this is what actually causes and ,0
explains a thing that people like to call Epoch which is excess exercise post oxygen consumption this is another way to think about it the only reason you're breathing is to bring in oxygen when offloads CO2 right if I'm no longer exercising why am I still breathing ,0
in other words once you stop the demand or the need for for energy you should stop ventilating but you don't right that's because in the case of low intensity exercise the second you stop you're right back down to resting ventilation no problem because you were able to match the need for energy with ,0
the offload of waste one to one during that exercise when you start creeping up the intensity you can't do that so you have to basically start stealing a little bit of fuel here so even though you're done exercising you're still ventilating because you have to pay that back and pay that back by that I specifically mean you have to bring in ,0
oxygen because you have a whole bunch of waste that's been accumulating in your tissue that you've got to deal with and I'll walk you through what that waste is it's a particular molecule that a lot of people have heard of but grossly misunderstand so you got to be able to handle that so the reason that you sit there and go ,0
and continue to ventilate is because you're now trying to pay back that excess post exercise oxygen debt that's that oxygen debt we're specifically talking about all right so that being said as we start cruising up that RQ starts going up up up up up up up and if we get to one your 1.0 you're you're in a like you're hurting you're ,0
in a pretty good spot all right I like that you're hurting you're in a pretty good spot yeah a window into Dr Annie galpin's mind now you really want to be a subject in his uh his laboratory study sure masochists swarm to Andy's lab absolutely all right so ,0
the idea that I will lose more fat by being in an exercise situation that is burning more fat it seems to make sense but it's a massive failure to understand the metabolism it's the exact same explanation to like exercising fasted doesn't matter so the exercising fasted issue under normal circumstances is irrelevant because you have plenty of ,0
fuel in the system even when you haven't eaten breakfast that morning now if you're talking like extended fasting over multiple days this is a different scenario if muscle glycogen liver glycogen and blood glucose are at sufficient levels then you absolutely have enough energy to perform almost any type of exercise that most people are ,0
doing you know maybe if you're Rob and you're at Mile 20 today it's a different story but the vast majority of us have plenty of fuel sitting around so we're not going to burn more into fat um just because we didn't eat breakfast that morning so that just doesn't make energetic sense we have a lot of backup ,0
supplies you're never out the trick here is this is there's a there's a concept here we call crossover concept so as we are starting to move up exercise intensity we start burning a higher percentage of our fuel from carbohydrates and a lower percentage of our fuel coming from fat I'm sleeping ,0
that's the highest percentage of your fuel that will be coming from fat of any activity you could ever do so if the theory that I'm going to stay at a lower intensity to burn more fat was true the optimal fat burning strategy would then be to sleep like that doesn't make sense of course it doesn't so why would then going at a ,0
slightly elevated rate somehow all of a sudden magically make you lose fat it doesn't actually make sense when you think about that where you're like oh yeah there's no way so it's a percentage trick it's a difference between absolute and relative this is what this confusion is so yes as ,0
you start doing lower intensity exercise whether you're faster than audit it's irrelevant but lower intensity exercise a greater percentage of your fuel is coming from fat however your total fuel expenditure is very low so that whole total carbon balance is not really being shifted much as you start exercising at a very high ,0
intensity you actually start getting a higher percentage of your fuel from carbohydrate and a lower percentage from fat in fact at rest about the highest you can get in most people is about 60 of your fuel from fat as you're sleeping you might be 70 but you'll never be in a position ever no matter what sort of thing you've heard ,0
on the internet you'll never be in a situation where fat is your only fuel source the highest I've probably ever seen is like 70 percent um you should probably beat about that that's a kind of a good number to think um honestly but people will understand a little bit about metabolism to be ,0
dangerous but not enough we'll we'll throw out these terms like fat adapted and fat adapted is a real thing but is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes right it is this idea thinking like I can get into a spot where I'm maximizing fat burning maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not ,0
the same thing at all right that's the confusion so if you enhance fat oxidation and exercise that does not enhance fat loss per se right so this is a lot of the confusion that's happening right so as we start moving up we can never get in a position where we're ,0
using fat only as a fuel again at best you're at 70 fat 30 carbohydrate for a lot of reasons we probably just don't have time to get into today however the opposite is possible when you get into true high intensity exercise you'll be basically 100 carbohydrate and zero percent fat all right that is very possible that in fact ,0
is 1.0 that's what our Q 1.1 is actually because your ventilation got so high you actually exceeded that number even though you're at 100 carbohydrate this is what people came up with the idea then it's like whoa I don't want to burn carbs I want to lose fat so my response to that is always like okay great ,0
so it makes sense burning fat losing fat burning carbs is losing what then like you think your liver shrunk like wait a minute what did you lose then where'd it come from it's all coming as carbon don't worry about where it came from for your fuel it just has to come out as carbon right there are differences in exercise ,0
efficiency for performance with our professional athletes of course but if the only goal here is phallus it doesn't matter where you get it from the last Bridge we have to connect here is like well wait a minute if I only burned carbohydrate how did I actually lose that fat there was there was that love handle sitting ,0
on the side of me how did that come out of me if I never burned that from my fuel what you're failing to understand is there's a balanced game that happens here so if you were to do a bunch of high intensity exercise training and you burned only muscle glycogen and blood glucose and maybe even you did it for so long you burned some liver ,0
glycogen the body understands that it has expelled a lot of energy from that side of the equation it's going to do a couple of things now it's very difficult to go through this fancy situation where you convert carbohydrates into fat and back and forth like that's actually like ,0
fairly hard what's easier to do with something you said earlier is actually just bias energetics to a different fuel source so in that scenario where you're down really low in your carbohydrate carbohydrate stores any carbohydrates you bring in are going to go to storage and since your net energy expenditure is ,0
something that your body regulates a lot any fat that you then bring in is going to be utilized as a fuel source because it knows it doesn't need it anymore that is in excess so that's how you actually use fat as a fuel because you've burned down carbohydrate storages as I'm hearing this uh a couple of ,0
things come to mind first of all thank you for that incredibly important description of what is otherwise a very confusing landscape for most people one of the key points I took away and I just want to say from the outset this is not exhaustive by any stretch is that burning fat does not equal losing fat from the body correct and then burning ,0
fat has to be divided into burning of body fat stores and we need to distinguish that from burning of dietary fat that is brought in correct oftentimes people don't disambiguate those correct and I'm also understanding that reducing one's body carbohydrate stores muscle glycogen liver glycogen Etc ,0
occurs during high intensity exercise yep as well as other ways but that is one very efficient way to tap into those stores which makes me wonder again this is one of these things that does it lead to a protocol makes me wonder whether or not doing high intensity let's say weight training for 45 to 60 Minutes 75 minutes of ,0
strength training power training hypertrophy training which we've covered in an episode about those topics and then doing some steady state cardiovascular exercise is there any benefit to that arrangement that would quote unquote enhance body fat loss from the body to be very specific now ,0
because unlike the idea that training fasted would shift the bias towards fat loss which it doesn't you've told us under those conditions muscle glycogen and maybe even liver glycogen is going to be depleted put simply can I enhance body fat loss by doing some cardio after a bout of weight training if you equate for total ,0
energy expenditure it won't matter now that you did bring up a very important point that I want to clarify if you look at the exercise modalities that we laid out in our previous uh conversations we talked about nine different adaptations one was skill and then speed power strength hypertrophy muscular endurance anaerobic capacity ,0
aerobic capacity and long duration endurance speed power and skill development have almost no benefit for fat loss because remember those are low weight a lot of rest and low volume they're not really really going to be helpful you can make a little bit of a ,0
case for strength a little bit but the total energy expenditure for strength training even if it's an hour if it's truly strength training it's fairly low because the repetitions are in the one to three range that's exactly it's not enough for total work so if you're trying to develop a protocol that sort of ,0
optimizes fat loss what you want to do you were close in my opinion is do a combination of something in the hypertrophy slash muscular endurance strength training realm okay so um six to Thirty repetitions something like that resistance training great deplete muscle glycogen maybe even a bit of liver glycogen maybe a little bit ,0
depending on if you're doing it for a long time but probably not a noticeable amount okay so an hour of of uh hypertrophy type training if you're training hard with low responsibils and you really did an hour you would for sure get there but most people don't because the reason why I crave large bowls of oatmeal and rice after I do ,0
weight training yeah and replenish muscle glycogen totally right um then you maybe do a little bit of very high intensity maximum heart rate well overview to Max uh hard as you can for 20 30 45 60 seconds something like that with some recovery a lot of recovery and repeated and that's going to do a great job of ,0
replenishing muscle glycogen right if you do that long enough you'll get the liver but again most people don't because it's really really hard to go that hard so liver is sort of last Last Resort yeah basic mechanics here which will which we'll actually get into as our like third segment here is ,0
energy production comes from the local exercising muscle first and foremost from phosphocreatine and carbohydrate stores right and so again and we store it in a muscle we call it glycogen right that's it's your first sign of light on defense if you need glucose outside of that you're going to start pulling it from the blood but one ,0
of the things your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything blood pH blood glucose blood pressure and electrolyte concentrations like it really does not want to mess with those things at all it will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standardized right you generally because you need all those things for ,0
your brain to work and your brain will stop working right if you lose blood pressure it won't go up there pH changes you can't run metabolism electrolytes change you can't think and glucose is a primary fuel source for the brain it's going to be a problem right so if that number starts to come down because you're grabbing glucose out of the blood ,0
your liver is going to then kick in it's going to break down its glycogen to put glucose in the blood to keep the blood number the level in fact one of the things you'll see is blood glucose concentrations rise during exercise they don't fall in fact they rise as an anticipatory state if you train a lot your blood glucose will start going up ,0
before you start moving it knows it's coming right so you you can play that game you can rob Peter to pay Paul for a long time and tell your liver runs out and that's what actually is a bonk in terms of like long duration endurance stuff you're talking many many miles several hours typically we say oh it's got to be over two hours ,0
before your liver starts to become a real problem or it has to be tremendously intense because of those reasons you have to burn through just a lot of energy before your liver starts to get into a problem you can continue to train when your muscle glycogen levels are low in fact people say glycogen depletion ,0
and muscle but it's it's generally misnomer and you are going to have tremendous signals of fatigue when that number gets lower than 75 percent so people think that like their muscles are getting heavy you're probably still 75 full a lot of folks will quit around the 50 the highest I've ever seen is like 95 true depletion and that's an ,0
extremely high level cross-country skiers and like they're deltoid it's very very low some very talented Runners will get fairly low in their quads but the vast majority of folks by the time you're 50 depleted you're gonna quit it's going to be really really challenging so you're never really going to get that low it's like a bit of a ,0
protective mechanism right but when your liver gets low you're going to be shut down and that's the case of if you've ever been to like a marathon and you've seen people run like 25 and a half miles and then they just like Bonk they go into like baby deers walking stands and then they collapse and you're like how are you ,0
mentally weak like you ran 26 miles and you can't run the last point it ain't mentally weak it is if your liver is done it's gonna stop you because there's no more backup reserves muscle you can get away with you can push through it liver will not let you go any farther I find this fascinating because it makes me wonder whether or not the liver being ,0
depleted sends a neural signal to the brain or the brain must register some signal like I would like to be alive tomorrow thank you whatever is happening right now um stopping is going to be safer than continuing yeah and so that stop signal um is is one that I think a lot of people including myself are are ,0
intrigued by because we always think that it's uh related to willpower but the brain needs to preserve itself and as the master computer I mean there are ways to go into kind of automaton type um you know not thinking just doing type uh Behavior you have override switches right and you can play those cards and you can get better at learning and be ,0
being less sensitive to that switch that's exactly what happened when you first start training right you start to realize like oh my gosh I'm super tired then you realize really quickly like oh I'm totally fine here and this is like the pick pick your person who's made sayings like this but it's like you're really ,0
only 10 percent depleted or 30 or 40 or something we're all operating 40 of what we could do of course any of those things are true because it is like a little bit of an override um you've just gotten very sensitive to being a small percentage depleted and you've learned okay I'm tired and there is a long way to go past that but once you get past ,0
that and you flip that override switch a lot um you just you're going to break quickly because you basically learn to ignore that signal and problems can happen really quickly after that and that's even experienced endurance athletes if you hit that level it's like you're going to be hitting the ,0
concrete next and that's you know potentially a problem I want to make sure I understand a concept that you referred to earlier correctly because I have a feeling that I don't and that's this issue of how the body accesses body fat stores when in a sub caloric State and I'm doing mainly glycogen burning exercise ,0
yeah what I heard you say and please correct me where I'm undoubtedly wrong what I heard you say was that okay I go into the gym and I start lifting weights I'm burning muscle glycogen mostly local to the muscles that I'm using and then I start pulling glycogen from the bloodstream ,0
maybe there's some body fat stores that are mobilized probably not dipping into my liver glycogen okay I complete the workout maybe I even hop on the air dime bike and do a little Sprint yeah go for a jog maybe um I eat immediately afterward maybe I don't eat for a few hours afterwards but ,0
across the day I ingest fewer calories than I burn is it the case that body fat is mobilized in order to replace the glycogen that my sub caloric intake was insufficient to provide in other words because I didn't eat enough to fill the glycogen stores ,0
am I using body fat converted into glycogen to fill those stores right and if so is that a case where I'm no longer exhaling carbons in order to burn body fat but rather I'm repurposing body fat into muscle have I turned fat into muscle in that case yeah I'm really glad uh you asked this because I did a very ,0
poor job on that last Point talking about earlier I'm realizing playing back in my head because that's so many really good questions you cannot turn fat into muscle can you turn muscle into fat no I'm so glad you said that because when I was in college yeah our I don't want to out that person the physiology teacher ,0
seem to think still at that point that one could lift weights get muscular but then it would eventually turn into body fat that that I that myth has I think largely been dispelled I heard that so many times as a kid I heard it so many times in college I heard it so I hear it so many times in our ,0
uh undergraduate students from other faculty and such so um no like they're not the same structures they are very different um let me take you out on answering this better you're really really close so yeah if you were to do that type of exercise where you've burned a lot of muscle ,0
glycogen how is it I'm losing stored fat right that's really the Crux of the question and it doesn't even actually matter if you then went ahead and ingested carbohydrates or fat post exercise that's not really a thing you hit on a couple of key things number one this is all under the assumption that total ,0
caloric intake is still low right you have a total need it's below okay I also want to flag calories in calories out is not the only thing that matters this is a very complex thing calories in is incredibly complicated calories out is even more complicated okay so we just maybe another series we can spend on ,0
that alone all right so don't don't go nuts about that you have to be hypocaloric one way or the other if you burn a bunch of muscle glycogen and you are hyper caloric you're still going to add fat if you burn a muscle glycogen and you're hypochloric you're going to lose fat right think about it this way ,0
you're in a negative calorie state where are those calories going to come from are you going to reduce your muscle glycogen storages permanently no no are you going to reduce your glycogen storage in your liver no you want to reduce blood glucose no no way right so where is that extra energy coming from it's coming from your ,0
stored fat it is your backup Reserve Energy System um the way that I want to fly this here is people tend to think about it as like carbohydrates versus fat that's not it's more like a chain more like a bicycle where there's a front gear and a back gear you turn one gear it turns the other one these are complementary systems they are not and ,0
or systems right you're turning one and when we go through carbohydrate metabolism maybe here in a second you'll understand why you have to have an anaerobic and an aerobic component to that there is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen that has to happen the only way to engage in fat metabolism is aerobic ,0
and oxygen there's no anaerobic component to it there's a fundamental difference there so the your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible it is the primary fuel source for a reason your fat is not meant to be flexible it is meant to be Unlimited that's the basic point so you want flexibility over here and an ,0
unlimited capacity over there now I'm safeguarded against any energetic need okay I need to run up a hill for safety cool carbohydrates are there I need to then run for 17 hours cool fat is there we want both of these systems you want to be able to have great energy throughout the day you want a slow drip coming from fat you ,0
don't want up and down up and down feel great up and down awesome you want to be able to think very quickly and get hyper focused boom carbohydrates ramp right up right get it into the brain get thinking better get thinking clearly fast so we want all these not just for exercise purposes for but for activities of daily living we want an optimal system here ,0
and when people use the terms like fat adapted they're generally hijacking that and they're thinking it used to be a thing we said all the time and like all of my undergraduate classes for years and that idea of metabolic flexibility is using optimal fuel sources and optimal types not maximizing fat usage the people have co-opted that term of ,0
metabolic flexibility to be like oh yeah yeah therefore learn how to maximize fat burning that's not what that term means that term means maximizing your ability to use whatever fuel is optimal in that time now I'll Grant you most people aren't fantastic and using fat as a fuel source relative to the other direction ,0
but nonetheless the the gold standard here should be maximizing both all right finally answering your question if I were to to burn a bunch of muscle glycogen how am I losing that fat well the fuel you're ingesting in that hypochloric state is going to say hey look we have a lot of muscle glycogen we have to replenish so any carbohydrate ,0
that comes in needs to be biased towards storage it's got to go into those tissue any fat that comes in or doesn't even come in but any fat that we're using for fuel needs to be utilized for activity and that's where the caloric expenditure from fat comes in so you're basically saying you're ,0
General physiology the energy for that starts coming from fat and the energy that's coming in from carbohydrate needs to be simply stored and so what you see is your respiratory quotient changes right the rer is going is going off and so in the exercise moment it shot way up for carbohydrates and shot way down for fat ,0
as the compensatory response it goes the other direction because your body's saying we are low on carbohydrates don't use them for fuel unless we absolutely have to right so use them for storage get our fuel from the fat side of the equation and so what you're generally going to say is like oh I'm burning more fat just ,0
sitting around after things like that and that's not even taking into the equation the epoch part which is like it's not actually as large as people think it is it's fairly small but it is it adds up sort of over time so um does that explain a little bit better about how you lose fat when you ,0
actually only burn carbs for exercise you explained it beautifully you talked about Epoch the post-exercise oxygen consumption yeah not being that significant in terms of energy utilization even though today we're talking about endurance and different forms of endurance I do have to ask whether or ,0
not people consider the elevation in basal metabolism that occurs when there's more muscle around yeah because muscle is such a metabolically demanding tissue um you know if is there a straightforward-ish equation you know if one adds one pound of of lean muscle tissue to their body even if it's ,0
distributed across multiple muscle groups does that equate to a caloric need of X number of calories per day and is that because of the muscle protein synthesis needs of that muscle or it's glycogen storage needs or both if you don't have enough muscle you start to have problems with fat loss it's difficult challenge if you have enough ,0
muscle and you're just trying to get extremely large if your ffmi is 24 and you're 15 body fat adding more muscles not really going to play a lot in the equation and here's why muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat but fat is not inert so fat is still going to burn a small number of calories muscle burns more but ,0
it's not nearly what people think it is I'm a muscle guy I'm a muscle physiologist I would love to get people to have more muscle for any excuse I can it's not honest to say that though you're talking about when I was in undergraduate we would say numbers like 50 Cake House per day per pound is what you can look at right so if you ,0
put on a pound of muscle spread across the body your basal metabolic rate would go up by around 50 calories per day I think that number is grossly exaggerated it's probably a tenth of that six to ten calories maybe um it's hard to know exactly what that number is but the more recent estimates are are ,0
something like that so now on one hand you could say oh my gosh that is not even meaningful the other hand you could say that's super meaningful it just depends on time domain you want to put that out right so if you were to put on five pounds of muscle and your basal metabolic rate went up 30 or 40 calories a day well over the course of a thousand ,0
days like that actually adds up so you you could slice this any way you want um now maybe that number somewhere in between I don't really know it's not a field I paid that much attention to candidly because it's not a metric kind of like epoch ,0
um where it's like we used to really harp on it and now it's sort of like wow maybe we exaggerated that like honestly just a bit but to me it doesn't change the equation much because if you don't have enough muscle as they describe there are other consequences that are going to make fat loss hard and so you need to have sufficient muscle ,0
if the additional caloric expenditure is the carrot great if it's something else I don't really care there's just enough evidence that you need to have it or I should say there's enough evidence that it will really help you in your path um maybe a few calories here there is not really the thing especially if you understand ,0
a normal food item anything you pick is going to be probably a couple of hundred calories one bad food Choice a day well out kick almost any amount of coverage you got on adding muscle mass to you so like you're really stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime if you're worried about how many calories you're getting from ,0
adding muscle um fat loss is going to be about regulating that carbon intake above and beyond anything else I'd like to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you ,0
better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health and well-being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there however is that ,0
you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors Etc but you don't know what to do with that information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what your specific numbers are of course but then also what sorts ,0
of Behavioral do's and don'ts what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you'd like to try inside tracker you can visit insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans again that's insidetracker.com huberman to get ,0
20 off so I've heard about this concept of metabolic flexibility mentioned a few times frankly you're the first person who's ever explained it to me in a clear and concise way how do I know if I am metabolically flexible and how do I increase my metabolic flexibility sure there's no specific standard which is ,0
actually a good thing right and so if you have a level of specificity that you want or need metabolically then you don't actually want to be in this Middle Ground an example would be if you are a performing in a type of exercise or an athlete who performs in a sport that is glycolically dominated you don't want to be optimally metabolically flexible you ,0
don't want to be super quote unquote fat adapted you want to be biased towards the energy you're going to use the same could be true for the other end of the spectrum so in those particular cases it's not optimal to be equally effective because there are no free passes in physiology right your ,0
energy producing systems will up regulator down regulate accordingly so you will actually limit your ability to say maximally utilized carbohydrate as a fuel if you're trying to up regulate your ability to use fat as a fuel and so this is like there's a saturation point outside of that Spectrum most people ,0
just say hey like I want to feel great throughout the day to be able to do a bunch of different things how do you know a couple things there's a lot of biological markers you can take there's also just some some practical takes now none of these markers by themselves are any sign what you want ,0
to do is probably a couple of them and then say okay this is maybe a clue so again it's really important to emphasize not a single one of these tests that I'm about to walk you through automatically means you can't use fat as a fuel or the other case which is maybe you're poor using carbohydrate as a fuel so disclaimers aside ,0
we'll get into a couple of them so should we think about these as informative and useful but not diagnostic exactly what we call this data inspired or data LED and not data driven right okay cool so number one you want to think about just overall functionality do you have a reasonable ,0
regulation of your energy throughout the day now many things could be going into this which is why these are not specific Diagnostics but as a basic measure we talked about blood glucose levels um you know a lot of people will say again you want that to be something like between 80 and 90 um milligrams per deciliter is the blood ,0
glucose level and you can go look at the the cutoff points for what determines to be pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic Etc um what I can actually recommend um this is there's a little bit of science here actually that I'll walk you through but a lot of this is my personal preference um I generally want people to be at 85 or lower and that's because of a couple ,0
of things number one there's actually some papers that showed any uh every single point increase above 85 increases your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by about 6 percent okay great so technically while maybe 90 or 95 or even up to 100 are you know in the quote-unquote normative values ,0
that's one clue again it's not definitive by itself doesn't mean anything you need to really pay attention to what increasing by six percent actually means but it's a data point where I'm looking at if I actually then see symptomology and we run you through maybe some questionnaires ask how you're feeling ,0
throughout the day and we see uncontrolled energy about so you're a lot of energy then get really really tired and swings okay another data point all right and we may patch a few of these things together that may give me some Clues um that being said again this a lot of this rhetoric is ,0
used to then scare people off of carbohydrates and that is I want to be as clear as possible that is not not truly um the only thing people should care about right it can be a thing that can also be unrelated there are reasons you could have blood glucose concentrations at ,0
this level or energy swings that are unrelated to carbohydrate ingestion at all all right so one test you can either run in addition to that if you're going to get blood glucose measured you can look at some markers we talked about earlier Richard AST and ALT what we talked about how you can kind of look at that AST to ,0
LT ratio before you can actually do the inverse which is look at alt and AST the kind of normative value there you're going to look at is like 0.8 I actually like to see it lower than that and that alone has been actually associated with blood glucose dysregulation and so if you've seen multiple of science again we're looking for patterns and patterns ,0
and patterns in both in our case biomarkers symptomology and performance and now you're if all three of those things are lining up you may have an issue so performance wise a couple of little tests you can run um ideally you have some sort of standard workout you do oh and hopefully it's it's pretty objective so in other ,0
words like uh I run the same 15 minute Loop every morning for my cardio okay great how long does it take you to run that Loop like you could pick whatever distance it doesn't really matter what's your heart rate during that thing and then what's your perceived exertion now you should be able to do that fasted with very little drop in performance ,0
okay if you can do that then that tells me you're fairly good at using a fat as a fuel source if however the one day you go to do your standard workout and you feel awful fasting that may be another clue that perhaps you're not very good at dialing in that system if your recovery afterwards ,0
in terms of heart rate recovery is very long it may be another clue that you have a poor utilization of fat as a fuel source the inverse can also be true so if I give you something in the neighborhood of like 50 or so grams of carbohydrate and 30 minutes later your face is falling off the table that's a good sign ,0
that you're in the opposite you're actually very very very poor utilizing carbohydrate as a fuel and the reason I bring that up is um that is equally a problem we send we hear people a lot make comments um like man I have to stay away from carbs I crash really hard if I do them that has a what that actually means is ,0
you're very poor at utilizing carbohydrates as fuel you're getting a your uh your sensitivity is way off we should be able to have carbohydrate at a reasonable dosage 50 grams and not fall asleep 30 minutes later or have to run to caffeine so that is a sign in our opinion this is again now just my practical brain telling you is that's a ,0
sign of dysfunction we should be able to have plenty of carbohydrates through the day if we choose to if we want to for any reason now of course if you were to throw 150 or 200 grams of carbohydrate in your belly you're probably going to take a little bit of an energy hit after that but we should be able to have a reasonable ,0
dosage and not you know have to fall asleep afterwards what is one way that people can enhance their utilization of carbohydrates uh for exercise the reason I ask is I think I fall into that category yep um I do consume some complex carbohydrates and fruit post resistance training and that tends to be ,0
when I'm hungriest for them but typically unless I'm I've just done some resistance training I keep most of my daytime meals relatively low carbohydrate and then in the evening I prefer slightly less protein and more carbohydrate because it has this effect of um sedating me a little bit yeah and I ,0
sleep well and I know this runs against what everyone was taught which is to not eat carbohydrates late in the day but I like it because then I tend to wake up in the morning with at least as far as I can tell my glycogen stores not necessarily topped off but but certainly filled yep um and I'm able to train fasted in the morning ,0
and my favorite pre-workout is consists of water and caffeine and electrolytes and maybe some supplementation as well but I love training fasted so there's actually a number of things um one little sneaky thing you threw in there is actually the use of caffeine so that's another sign if if you have to have caffeine to do your fasted training ,0
that's generally another sign you're not very good at using fuel so I use caffeine prior to resistance training workouts generally I don't need it for any kind of cardiovascular training yeah and when I say that it doesn't mean it's bad it's just like another clue that's like okay you should be able to do this ,0
without having to have caffeine to execute it now using caffeine to get a better result is sort of different as an ergogenic aid um we actually use a lot of high carbohydrate meals at the end of the day a lot of the times for our athletes who are cutting weight or trying to reduce weight so it is a fantastic way to handle a lot of things ,0
and that idea that if you eat carbs late at night that'll increase fat so like that's all is so old and so well destroyed scientifically that that's not a concern um there's just so much data showing in fact there's so much data on like eating timing is is uh generally poorly understood about when you can eat ,0
and what you can eat eating in the morning um versus eating at night like a lot of what we've heard in there is stuff in maybe we just saved that for sort of another day because we're going to get really far down that's about our weekend yeah but yes I think our plan is to cover that in an episode on nutrition ,0
um okay which is in this series the uh the only thing that would add to it is you know would you hear about ingesting carbohydrate late at night I should just say that uh at least in my case I'm eating the majority of my carbohydrate unless I trained yeah resistance trained early in the day and which guess I I post ,0
resistance training um in the last meal of the day but for me that's not really late at night that last meal is somewhere between 6 30 and 7 30 p.m so it's three or so hours or something like that before we go to sleep around 10 10 30 or so yeah so it's not you know midnight uh bowls of pasta I've done that too but um but typically ,0
it's not so I think that um people will be very interested uh myself included in how meal timing relates to all of this but um yeah let's so how do you improve fat utilization how do you improve carbohydrate organization let's Hammer both out really quickly ,0
um enhancing fat uh utilization is as simple as doing a little bit of work in a either pre-fat ingested state so anytime you ingest a nutrient prior to training you're going to bias towards that nutrient right which is almost what we were talking about earlier so if you want to ,0
guarantee you burn more fat eat more fat prior to a workout now you're not going to lose fat but what you're what you're effectively signaling is we have an overabundance of this fuel preferentially Target this fuel now the downside is that may actually hinder your performance that's typically only a concern for people at a very high ,0
level um fat is a slower fuel source so if you're relying more upon that your top end is going to come down a little bit and so you wouldn't want to use that strategy prior to race if it is a carbohydrate dependent race all right and in fact we actually see ,0
long-term adaptations that would suggest that so the enzymes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism will down regulate and so you'll get worse at that so not not a great strategy there carbohydrate be the opposite right so if you have carbohydrate prior to exercise you're going to bias more towards that so a handful of things you can do ,0
if your total caloric intake is simply managed that's going to take care of a lot of these problems an appropriate eating strategy so the types of food the combinations of food all those things are going to make your post carbohydrate ingestion bunk a lot of those things can go away so there's a little bit of physiology that has to be ,0
corrected for so it's a little bit in one hand you can go very deep here right so the real answer of how we would do this is if we see a scenario like that we're going to do a whole set of analyzes we're going to go full Labs right probably extensive blood panel urine saliva stool even and we're going to figure out where is that glucose ,0
dysregulation coming from so a lot of people think like oh it's a metabolism issue it might be it also might just be a flag that something else is happening in the body so we're going to actually work backwards a lot to try to figure out exactly why that's occurring it may be as simple as oh you're eating a lot of your carbohydrates ,0
without any fiber or protein and we know that that's important because those will actually blunt the glycemic index like the rise in blood glucose so it could be a simple thing of just like oh your combination of food is doing it it's not the total amount um it may be something again more endogenous to the actual system ,0
uh it could be um a heart rate issue it could be a breathing issue there could be a number of things so the way to get better at it is to Simply train it and specificity is King here so if you want to get better at managing your blood glucose throughout the day so you're not feeling those things it could be a fuel issue ,0
but it could be a number of other things and it's just hard to go into all of them with within our time constraint so the Practical tool that I would say here is if you want to get better at managing energy throughout the day make sure that number one your protein is stabilized making sure number two you're ingesting your food in the right combinations ,0
ideally with some Fiber and or some protein or both that alone will help stabilize a lot of the problems then you need to train at a high intensity you want to get better at using carbohydrates as a fuel train at a higher intensity and have carbohydrates right before the workout we'll do that a lot if um ,0
uh if our if we see folks who are I kind of walk you through the test of identifying if you're not very good at using fat as a fuel the tests for not being good at using carbohydrate is the fuel is both that eating test I talked about as well as performance if you're a very very very slow starter it's just like really hard to get going that ,0
generally indicates you might be in a situation where you're not very good at using carbohydrates as a fuel so we're going to practice that we're going to have a pre-carbohydrate pre-exercise carbohydrate meal then we're going to do higher intensity stuff not the point of making you sick and digestive issues all that stuff but we ,0
want to get better at using carbohydrates as a fuel faster if you want to get better at doing the opposite then you do that opposite starter either again using the fat prior to the workout knowing your Peak Performance is going to go down a little bit but you're you're investing in adaptation right so it's ,0
not about that workout it's about what's going to happen six eight ten weeks from now investment is what you want to think about it or you could bring in some fasted training and so I want to really make sure I clarify when we were talking about it earlier I'm not at all against fasted training it's not it works it's just isn't required for fat loss it ,0
isn't required for fat adaptation it is a great option though if you want um what I was hoping to do with that conversation and maybe I didn't articulate that well is to not restrict people but is to open you up and they'll say you have a lot of options if you like to do fasted cardio amazing it is great if you hate it you don't have to ,0
you can reach the same performance goals the same physique goals without ever doing it if you love long duration steady state stuff it is great if you hate it there are other options higher intensity stuff again if we're just talking about fat loss so I hope now that that's a little clearer in terms of the same thing with ,0
nutrition if you like higher carb great if you like lower carb these are all great you have options and you don't have to fret so much over oh my gosh I have to do this thing a certain way and I absolutely hate it you don't have to worry about it hit those Concepts and you'll be fine a few minutes ago you mentioned that if ,0
we ingest a given macronutrient fat then the body will preferentially use that fuel source you ingest carbohydrate we'll use that fuel source is it always the case that the body uses the ingested macronutrient prior to using glycogen I have to imagine it's using both I mean if I were to have some ,0
carbohydrate be before um doing any kind of training the muscles still burn glycogen right or do they have some way to register the amount of circulating carbohydrate that would allow or available carbohydrate in the form of food stuffs uh that would allow them to not tap into their own muscle fiber stores with glycogen all ,0
right so the way we derive energy for exercise or basic maintenance a little bit about cellular physiology so you've got a couple of organelle and structures that we need to pay attention to the first one is the nucleus let's Hold You DNA the second one is the mitochondria and then everything outside of that you've got all these other organelle ,0
that do a bunch of things like ribosomes for protein synthesis etc etc all right now when you want to produce energy for exercise anytime you hear the word anaerobic you automatically understand we are meaning without oxygen all right great that all happens in the ,0
cytoplasm the cytoplasm is that space that is not the mitochondria not the nucleus so it's the space in between everything else this is like jelly-like substance that sounds there so anaerobic metabolism happens there every single aerobic metabolic process happens in the mitochondria ,0
all right why is that important if I go to create cellular energy and I need it the fastest possible I'm going to go for phospho creatine because it is stored directly in the cytoplasm the stoichiometric is one to one there which means for every mole of phosphocreatine I burn I can create one ATP it's one to one it is incredibly fast but it is very ,0
limited because think about how much of that could I possibly store in the small size of the cell that's it if I need energy past that point now I'll start using muscle glycogen because that is also stored in the cytoplasm so it is right there the Stoichiometry is not one to one it's a little bit higher probably like four to ,0
one so for every molecule of glycogen you burn you're going to get something like four ish some small number of ATP out of that which is great but again you're running into a storage problem how much can I possibly store inside a muscle cell it is very very fast much more effective than phosphor creatine but so there ,0
if I then want to metabolize any form of fat or if I want to complete the metabolization of carbohydrates I have to start transferring into the mitochondria now I start getting whole hosts of ATP if you were to fully run through this thing which I'll talk about in a second I'm ,0
called the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle you'll get now something like 28 or 30 or 35 kind of depending ATP per so the energetic output is much higher okay so here's exactly what happens then I'm going to walk you through this in the form of carbohydrate and then I'll come backwards and go through fat ,0
so remember carbohydrate it is one carbon molecule that has been hydrated so it is one to one so the actual chemistry here it is C H2O one carbon two H one o glucose is a six carbon chain so the chemistry here is C6 ,0
h12o6 six carbons six Waters very simple that's a carbohydrate all right so you can imagine if you're watching on the video here you'll you'll see my fingers going nuts I'll try to make sure I explain it to you all just listening in an easy fashion so you've got this chain of six carbons as in front of you and the very first step the metabolism is ,0
you snap that thing in half right so you break into two separate three carbon chains all right now in doing that you've got a little bit of energy because you broke that one Bond but not a tremendous amount this is called glycolysis so lysis being the split and you know glycoping like you split ,0
glycogen up got a little bit of energy of them all right you formed this three color carbon chain called pyruvate or pyruvic acid okay there's differences there but don't don't kill me General audience friends all right I gotta gotta give this communicate this to everybody ,0
so you got a little bit of that now you can't do much past that besides rip one more carbon off of each of those three carbon chains so I've got two three carbon chains I'd have to be careful how I do this with my finger so I don't flip you off here in a second but I burn one more off of each I get a little bit of energy and now that little two carbon ,0
chain I have two two concrete chains those are called acetyl-coa all right amazing I have now completed anaerobic glycolysis I've got really nothing left I can do here I made a little bit of ATP now wait a minute I have now freed two carbons because remember I started with six and I splited them apart but I ,0
didn't I had two three carbon chains I burned one each I've got two free floating carbons I have to now do something with them my body will not let me go through that part that last process unless I've got a plan for that free Carbon because I can't break it in half amazing here's what's going to happen ,0
if I have those three carbon molecules and I don't have anywhere I can put that carbon you're not going to go through that process it's going to stop it you're going to start building up pyruvate now at the same time you're breaking ATP ,0
for fuel that's called ATP hydrolysis right you have water that comes in you have a condensing and three phosphates that's why it's called ATP adenosine triphosphate one two three you break one of those phosphates off there you go there's your energy so now you have a free floating inorganic phosphate and an adenosine dye phosphate ,0
so two over there amazing that actually results because you use water for it results in a free-floating hydrogen ion okay just have to trust me hydrogen H2O any idea what a free floating hydrogen is um it's gonna that's acid yeah it says I was gonna say it's going to increase acidity that's ,0
what I said for anyone that's ever measured pH what you're really measuring is the the amount of hydrogen potential hydrogen that's what PH is Right 100 there's two definitions of pH but you get that's one of the two so is this are you going to tell me this is related to the the burn we're going to get close right so I've ,0
got a bunch of free floating um you've got the phosphates which are actually a problem two probably more of a problem Than People realize and that hydrogen what are you going to do with that hydrogen well one thing you can do is actually ship it over to pyruvate and bond it there ,0
we have a special name for that little molecule when you have pyruvate and you have a hydrogen attached to it you know what it's called uh hydrogen peroxide lactate lactate lactic acid this is that whole system right again I'm skipping some steps making a little bit of mistakes here intentionally folks just to make ,0
this assumed so what happens when you start running a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis you start seeing massive rises in lactate cool not lactic acid right right that's why we see associations between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue but the lactate is actually not causing the ,0
fatigue the lactate is actually sparing you from having a bunch of free-floating acid it's also can be then used directly back in the muscle because as soon as you bring in enough oxygen and you can take that hydrogen back off of it you've now turned it right back into pyruvate you can run it through ,0
this whole cycle as fuel that I'm about to do you can actually actually ship it out of the exercising muscle and ship it into a non-exercising muscle and then go backwards and make glucose what actually liberates hydrogen from from lactate well you like chemically yeah so what what liberates uh what well what are the stimuli that can take hydrogen off the ,0
pyruvate yeah oh yeah and and then in other words to reduce lactate and free up that hydrogen oxygen availability so in fact one of the major places that you ship hydrogen to or one of the major places that you ship likely to is your heart because it's what we call like the ultimate slow touch fiber and it is has ,0
a ton of freely available mitochondria which have a ton of access to oxygen so it can actually then go to it form water the H2O can be used to form water and now we have a place to store the hydrogen got it right cool so as a result of anaerobic glycolysis ,0
we have made a little bit of ATP we've created a lot of waste and we don't have anywhere to to go with these end products so when you do anything of a higher intensity and it says I need energy fast you're going to go to this system first right right past ATP because it is the fastest place to get energy but you're ,0
not going to get much of it and you've got to deal with the waste products boom right back to the beginning of our conversation endurance is about two things energy production and waste management and we're right we're fatigue buffering this is it right how well can you handle the elevations in hydrogen ,0
right drop in PH and how and then what are you going to do with these products if you want to fully metabolize a carbohydrate you then have to take some do something with those pyruvates or those acetyl coase what you're going to do if oxygen is available you will take those things and ship them into the mitochondria ,0
they have to go through some cell walls and some other things like that but they're going to get inside there once they're in there that two carbon acetyl-coa runs through this entire cycle that we call the Krebs cycle that's this really interesting place that's where B6 and nmn people are like that's where that whole stuff starts to ,0
kick in all your B vitamins basically run that entire circle and you're going to start off the top you have a bunch of fun stuff going on but as a part of that Circle you're going to pull off some some of the hydrogen ions you're going to send these to What's called the electron transport chain that's where you're going to get a ton of ATP out of ,0
and as a result about halfway through the turn you're going to pull off one carbon and about halfway through the other almost the other way to the Finish you're going to pull off the second carbon so you're going to take the second acetyl-coa run that entire thing same through as well and so what we did is we started off with a six carbon ,0
glucose chain we split it in half we call those pyruvate made a little bit of energy because we broke that one Bond of those two carbons that are in the middle cool those two three carbon molecules we pulled one carbon off of each we brought in sorry we moved those into the mitochondria we brought one off we took a breath brought in some oxygen bonded ,0
that Brett took out two CO2 exhales we ran the acetyl-coa through the Krebs cycle one two carbons per turn coming out of CO2 so we had six carbons total as we started and we exited with zero carbons now we have fully metabolized a molecule of carbohydrate that required an anaerobic start and an aerobic finish ,0
if you don't have a lot of mitochondria large mitochondria high functioning mitochondria you're going to limit your anaerobic performance because you're going to get they're going to run that door full very very quickly you can't go past it because hydrogen will build up way too fast and one of the things that we know is both temperature and pH ,0
run enzyme function so they're going to stop you won't even be able to run through in fact that ATP hydrolysis phase even if I gave you a whole infinite supply of ATP if I put enough acid in there it would stop working because the ATP Ace enzyme needed to split it won't be able to run in a highly acidic environment or a hot ,0
environment yeah at some point perhaps today perhaps in a future discussion but still not too far from now we could talk about the role of temperature uh in the uh in pyruvate from in terms of its regulation muscle contraction but I want to make sure I understood something correctly you mentioned these these uh two parallel fuel systems right one is ,0
essentially anaerobic right and the other is aerobic you said that if we can't pull enough um if we can't break enough bonds then we limit our anaerobic capacity correct I would have thought given that uh the mitochondria or the site for essentially for aerobic metabolism that we would be limiting our aerobic capacity as well ,0
um perhaps you could just clarify for me how these two things are divided or is there not a clean division is it not an either No in fact again I think it's better to think of these things rather as two separate parallel things as one big cycle they're one gear turning the next being compromised in one will compromise the other that I should say ,0
reminds me of what you said earlier which is this the bicycle gear analogy that works uh great so if you if you short circuit one basically that the chain can't move that's yeah fantastic okay so um so indeed they they are running in parallel but they are um interdependent yeah well they're actually not even running in parallel ,0
because they're actually funneling to the same endpoint right which is like if you're going to come from the anaerobic glycolysis route or you're going to come from the fat route which I'll talk about in a second they're both going to be limited in the mitochondria so when that thing's full it doesn't ,0
matter you can't run either system right so it is more of like a again if you're running the bike gears it doesn't really matter if the back one's larger or smaller because if either one is limited your toast because they're running on the same system you can you can you can sneak a little bit here and there but but not much ,0
you also really nicely highlighted how lactate this thing that we think of as a a limiting factor like the burn it gets in the way and it's the thing we need to stop and buffer and all all sorts of things sure it's actually really a fuel it's a tremendously effective fuel it is a strongly preferred fuel actually the is this interesting this is a very ,0
classic case of Association um correlation versus causation right so the original actually like there's a really cool history on lactate but it was originally found uh I think in Germany um part of my history there um somewhere in Europe in hunted Stags so one of the things is they sort of ,0
realized is like if we if we if we harvested a stag in a rest estate when it didn't know we were there versus if we chased it and it was ran down that these lactate concentrations were significantly higher in in the latter situation therefore lactate started immediately getting this association between High fatigue points and it is ,0
easy to measure if you were to do any sort of lactate test any sort of metabolic test you will see as fatigue increases lactate will also increase the Assumption there was then oh my gosh is the cause now we know like again it's not the thing it's in large part trying to buffer the negative consequences of ATP ,0
hydrolysis and and some other things so it is certainly playing a part in that role but it is not the core driver it's also why you don't need to worry about doing things to quote unquote um reduce lactate in the muscle after exercise or to clear lactate or any of those things you may still want to do ,0
those activities but not for that reason lactate's fine you're actually going to use it in again the neighboring exercise muscle fibers in the same muscle another muscle you can send it actually to the to the liver and it can actually go through gluconeogenesis and it can actually replenish liver glycogen just does that feel sore sorry you sound ,0
harder any number of sources you can also just kind of put it in circulation put a back in the muscle and once enough oxygen is there you can just kick it right back into either glucose or glycogen it's totally fine so it is obviously clear though once that number gets very very high other things are going to be happening they're going ,0
to be causing a lot of hurt and this is your managing waste right it is really an issue of managing what am I going to do with all this extra carbon what am I going to do with all this extra inorganic phosphate and some other nasty byproducts but that's the thing you have to deal with I'd love for you to teach me how ,0
different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long I happen to be exercising for example if I do a very short bout of exercise yep typically that's correlated with a higher intensity output I mean I suppose I could jog for one minute but here I'm thinking about sprinting for one minute or less ,0
which fuels are used is that mainly driven by fat stores by carbohydrate stores is it driven by dietary fat preferentially or carbohydrate that I've ingested if indeed I've ingested those or protein for that matter and then as we transition to exercise that goes a little bit longer you know anywhere from you know three to five ,0
minutes how do those ratios change and as we transition to longer duration what most people think of as endurance exercise but long duration output of you know 20 minutes or more leading all the way up to a full Marathon how does that change the ratio of fuel sources that are used and I'd be particularly interested in ,0
distinguishing between carbohydrate fat and protein that's ingested so coming from food sources or carbohydrate fat and protein that are coming from Storage sites within the body okay great let's start at zero seconds and run all the way through Marathon and we'll we'll flag the distinctions ,0
where they start changing as soon as you want to create muscle contraction and power the very first source of energy is phosphoid creatine that's going to power you for zero to maybe say eight to Fifteen twenty seconds of maximal exertion and that's in coming from the muscle fibers themselves yeah that is actually stored in the What's called the ,0
cytoplasm so this is a little area of space in the muscle fiber that's sort of like in this jelly-like substance and it's nice because one molecule of phosphoid creatine gives you one molecule of ATP so it's not a big energy output but it's very fast because it is stored right there in the local exercising muscle right now if you need ,0
energy past that point say you know 10 or 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of minutes this is now you're going to have to transition because you're going to burn through that phospho-creatine it's going to be out you're going to have to move to now carbohydrate metabolism this is what we call anaerobic glycolysis so there's two ,0
phases of glycolysis now glycolysis itself means glucose burning all right so this means we're using carbohydrate as a fuel source so initially when we start off this Cascade which is going to take us again for a couple of minutes carbohydrate utilization comes first from the exercising muscle so it's very ,0
similar to phosphocreatine that way if you start running low on it you can actually start pulling blood glucose and if blood glucose gets low you'll have to start getting glycogen from the liver to keep that up and we've sort of covered that conversation all right so a little bit of chemistry here just give me a little bit of room here so now remember ,0
a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule that has been hydrated so one carbon attached to one water and remember water is H2O most of the time when we're talking about glucose it is in the six carbon chain so six carbons attached to six water molecules all right great when I go to split this up through anaerobic glycolysis it works a little bit like ,0
this so you've got this six carbon chain the first step is to snap that thing in half you're going to make two three carbon chains now we broke one Bond right there so we got a little bit of energy but not a tremendous amount at the end of anaerobic glycolysis you're going to net something like three or four ATP so more than you get from the ,0
phosphate quadruple but still not very much there's another major downside that's coming in a second to this system the upside is it's fast now what actually one adaptation we get to training in this style is you'll increase your ability to store glycogen in your muscle which is great right we can actually ,0
biopsy you and measure the amount that you store in a training adaptation is awesome so you're able to sustain this system longer so perhaps 90 seconds into your interval training you hit a fatigue point and now you maybe can extend that to 100 or 115 seconds simply because you're storing more glycogen in the muscle ,0
before we have to and then go into the blood and get up in the form of glucose so that's great so we've got this six carbon molecule and we split this in half we got that little bit of ATP and now we're in this little tricky position because this three carbon molecule is what we call pyruvate pyruvic acid and again chemistry folks I'm skipping some ,0
steps I'm going to intentionally make some mistakes here I'm making sure the entire world listening regardless of where they come in can follow me here okay so don't burn me on the details right you've got this pyruvate the problem is you can no longer do anything with that glycolysis is over you've got to make a choice ,0
right in order to make something out of those three carbon molecules you've got to ship them to the mitochondria as we said that is the only place of aerobic metabolism right we cannot do aerobic metabolism anywhere else until we enter the mitochondria so anytime we cross that barrier we know we've automatically ,0
switched from anaerobic to aerobic well here's the problem if you were to take one more carbon off that three carbon pyruvate you have to now do something with that carbon waste okay so before when we split the six carbon chain we didn't actually leave any carbons free floating we just split a two molecule in half ,0
when we go to split from pyruvate and make it into this two carbon molecule called acetyl-coa or seal COA now we've got a free-floating carbon we have to have a strategy for that because that's going to increase the acidity level any enzyme in our body that works to create fuel is very pH sensitive right so if this ,0
thing if pH gets off either high or low these enzymes can't work and that's really really important because even if I were to give you a direct injection of ATP remember that's that energy currency that's the only way we can actually form energy I guess remember to clarify anytime we're using phosphoid creatine or glucose or fat which we'll get to a ,0
second we're not actually getting energy for exercise by breaking those down or getting energy that we can use to then make ATP we break that ATP down that's what's actually powering muscle contraction um you can go back to our previous episode where we'll walk you through the detail of the muscle contraction but ,0
that's what we're after okay so in the case of pyruvate if we split that off we have got to deal with that and the only way in the best way we can deal with that is oxygen remember we're going to breathe in O2 that O2 is going to combine with that free-floating carbon makes CO2 we're going to Exhale that thing out that's our Waste ,0
Management strategy but that has to happen in the mitochondria remember if we're using oxygen it has to be in the mitochondria so if we have the ability to ship pyruvate into the mitochondria or golden but what happens if we don't ,0
why do we not well if we don't have enough mitochondria or mitochondria are too small or they're too far away or we don't have sufficient oxygen availability why don't we have sufficient oxygen availability because we created the pyruvate too fast and the demand in the mitochondria is ,0
exceeded by the buildup of pyruvate and so now we're having this giant backlog and this thing fills up fast we have a couple of strategies here well when you're going through ATP and you're splitting it's called hcp hydrolysis in of doing that remember ATP is a adenosine molecule and then the T part ,0
is triphosphate one two three which means you have three phosphates attached to the end when you break that phosphate off that's where you get your energy so now you have an inorganic phosphate and an ADP it doesn't diphosphate two that process requires water it's called hydrolysis as a result of that you then have a free floating hydrogen and as you ,0
well know that is acid right that's potential hydrogen that's what that means and so you've increased the acidity in the muscle by breaking up all this ATP and so oh we're building up acid we have building up pyruvate we don't have nowhere to go with it and we can't cleave off a carbon because now we're just going to exacerbate ,0
the acid increase so what we can do is we can take those hydrogens that we're building up and store them on the pyruvate a pyruvate that's holding an extra acid has a special name and we call that lactate all right so that's why we see this buildup of lactase so one of the downsides of anaerobic glycolysis is an ,0
incredibly High rate of waste production now lactate is not the cause of fatigue in fact if you think a little bit more carefully about what I just said it's actually stopping you it's what we call a acid buffer you can actually use it for a bunch of other things you can ship it to a neighboring muscle fiber in the same ,0
muscle that's not working you can ship it to the liver you can ship it to the heart and a bunch of other places and then you can actually just work backwards so if you ship it to for example the heart and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free you can bring in the oxygen attach it to that hydrogen make water ,0
and now you're right back to pyruvate you put two pyruvate back together and now you just make glucose so you can actually store it in the liver this is a process called gluconeogenesis through this fancy thing called the Corey cycle which is what the the proper cycle here is so you can use it as a very potent fuel ,0
source in fact a lactate is a tremendously valuable fuel source I'm not like for exercise but for cognition and a bunch of other things so lactase in fact this is why um if you've seen the research about pre-exam testing exercise uh you'll see a noticeable increase in exam scores if you do a 20 minute about of exercise ,0
prior to taking the exam and it's largely in part probably because of things like elevations and lactate how intense of exercise uh would be most beneficial I don't know that exact answer I just know that generally any form of exercise is good but if you were to reach a reasonably high heart rate you're probably going to see in fact ,0
there's an acute and chronic adaptation here so Folks at exercise have better memory memory retention scores and exams Etc but then also doing it prior to that exam make sure you recovered and rested back down the street but you'll generally perform better previous guests on the huberman Lab podcast who's the who's a psychology professor and ,0
neuroscientist and also dean of College of Arts and Sciences at New York University NYU Wendy Suzuki is religious about daily morning exercise yeah specifically for this purpose of enhancing learning and memory and has a lot of really beautiful data I consider one of the real Pioneers in this space ,0
um so if people want to learn more they can look to that episode or Wendy's work we can provide a link to a couple of the papers but this is fantastic in that it's incredibly clear I think for the first time I'm understanding what what lactate is really doing yeah um and it's dispelling a lot of myths ,0
that I think I and a lot of other people arrive to the discussion about lactate with what happens when the bout of exercise extends longer amazing so if we want to continue past that point we have to have some sort of strategy to get through it right we're stuck we're out of gas we have to then ship it to the mitochondria ,0
and now we're going to enter what's called aerobic glycolysis and this is going to take us anywhere from again say that 90 seconds of all that work up to really 20 30 minutes in fact it really will take us to unlimited if you look at a highly competitive marathon runner even those that are running say your two hour marathon those folks are burning up ,0
to 80 carbohydrate it is a it it is not a fat burning thing and the reason is fat metabolism is way too slow it provides a lot of energy but it is incredibly slow if you're trying to run a four and a half or so minute mile repeated 26 times you have to be moving fast are they ingesting carbohydrate as a fuel source during the ,0
race unless you're on the team you don't know they won't really tell you these are sort of Trade Secrets um it would be I would say fairly rare to not have something right there's a bunch of different strategies if you're going to go really long like some of these um like cycling where the races ,0
will be several hours then you actually might go to some fat as fuel sources I I know a lot of cyclists are using ketones and things like that now but traditionally most endurance folks are going to buy us heavily towards carbohydrate um now ,0
in one respect you're not going to run out of carbohydrates until you're many hours in these folks are a unique case but the average individual who's doing an hour hour and a half cardio even you're not going to be limited by your carbohydrate stores you're going to be just fine you're ,0
gonna be limited by some other things which will maybe sort of break down here in a second but you're going to be fine there a lot of those folks will take carbohydrate they'll have very specific intervals you want to you do want to be careful though of ingesting too many fast carbohydrates prior to your exercise spout um we ,0
actually have this little thing that's called the insulin glucose double whammy and what that means is when you ingest carbohydrates immediately your blood glucose goes up and that's depending on the type of carbohydrate and things like that well the same thing happens with exercise and so what happens is insulin wants to start pulling glucose out of ,0
the blood at the same time muscle wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood and so we have this giant bolus of carbohydrate come in and then all of a sudden our blood sugar crashes and so if you're going to be doing so your your first half marathon or something like that and you're in those giant Corrals where there's like you ,0
know 100 people waiting to go and you're standing there for 45 minutes you may or may not want to slug down like three or four bananas in a bagel and and honey and things like you probably don't need that now not everyone experiences this double whammy but it has been shown in literature to happen to some people so you want to just be a little bit careful ,0
um an easy way to combat that is just practice exactly what you're going to do in your race in your training that's like the simplest advice ever but you'd be stunned how many people do things uh during the race that they've actually never done in training I suggest people do exactly what you describe also for any kind of cognitive testing of course ,0
before a big exam is not the time to discover whether or not you can handle twice as much espresso or take a nootropic for the first time or no uh or change anything I mean if if indeed the the score on that exam is is Meaningful to you you keep keep things regular so to recap what we've done here is we started off in the cytoplasm with this ,0
glucose molecule that is six carbons we took that thing we split it in half we call that thing anaerobic glycolysis we made a little bit of energy but not much we take those three carbon molecules we ship them into the mitochondria we take each one of those we clear off one carbon each those carbons we take a breath in we attach them to oxygen we ,0
exhale them get rid of that energy we are now fully into aerobic glycolysis each one of those two carbon molecules we run through the Krebs cycle each round the Krebs cycle Burns one two carbons so we go one two one two and now we've gone from six carbon molecule all the way down to zero we used the hydrogens that we pulled off of that ,0
Krebs cycle run to go to the electron transport chain from there we made a whole bunch of ATP and so we have now fully metabolized one molecule of carbohydrate and the end product of all of it is simply ATP water and CO2 beautiful and leads me to the conclusion that most everything is ,0
really about utilization of carbons and exhaling CO2 is that how I should think about bookending what you just described this is why we started off the conversation with the circle of life this is really a carbon game this is why we call Chemistry with carbon organic chemistry right that's what this whole ,0
thing is about any living being has to run through metabolism it's all a carbon game any living being has to use ATP this is all just a big fancy game of how do I make ATP and handle the waste remember endurance is all about Waste Management fatigue resistance the same thing and energy production we're playing a ,0
game here the whole game bring in energy use it mitigate waste products so when thinking about aerobic exercise or long duration exercise in this case anything longer than five minutes for that matter five minutes all the way up to an ultra marathon ,0
the breathing associated with endurance exercise the heart beating which of course is associated with the breathing and vice versa it's really all about bringing oxygen into the system that then allows those carbons to be used and within the mitochondria specifically and then carbon dioxide to be exhaled as we ,0
work through the carbons of the sort of beads on a string is that right unless you're moving incredibly fast for a very long time and we're talking probably north of 90 minutes endurance is really not a game of making sure I have enough fuel it is simply managing the waste production and that's exactly what you described ,0
you need to bring in the oxygen so you can handle the carbon that's building up as a result of both the anaerobic anaerobic glycolysis that's our game here if we start talking about endurance events longer than that now we do have to start worrying about running out of muscle glycogen running out of liver ,0
glycogen Etc or if we are at that two hour mark or so and we're moving very very very fast but anything south of that is just managing carbon buildup and we do that best through oxygen utilization or getting more efficient having a higher capacity for our anaerobic side ,0
so we can do that by having either more glycogen in our muscle so that lasts longer or building better asset buffering systems and there's a whole line of supplementation that are specifically acid buffers there's a whole line of training there's a whole line of breathing to manage this that so we have a lot of strategies where we can ,0
maximize endurance all we have to do is go back to the earlier part of our talk which is figure out what's the actual limiting step and then train according to that or do your strategy your nutrition your supplementation that defeats that limiting factor for an example if you're trying to maximize your performance in ,0
this 20 second maximal burst and your strategy for that was to make sure your muscle glycogen is saturated it's probably not going to help a ton because you're not going to be limited by total fuel you're going to be limited by your ability to buffer acid however storing more glycogen in your muscle in preparation for a marathon is a ,0
tremendously effective strategy because that will become a limiting factor so what we can do actually next if you'd like is we can just walk through these and look at the individual limitations where the failure Point happens and that effectively will outline your strategy for improving them so you taught us about carbohydrate utilization as a fuel ,0
source what about fat and what about protein great I'll start with protein because it's easy it is generally at best going to represent 10 percent of your energy output now that will grow over time in terms of if you did a several hour lot of exercise when you ,0
started doing it you might be using five percent of your energy from protein and then in that micro to 10 or so and that happens because you start running low on muscle glycogen you start running low on liver glycogen you start then having to pull in energy from another place so like as those numbers go down you'll see an increased ,0
uptick of energy from fat as well as protein having said that it's not a tremendous fuel source it is only aerobic so it has to be oxidized those are the same thing when I say oxidized you use oxygen to burn something to make a fuel um so it's not a significant contributor to energy in that regard and unless ,0
you're talking ultramarathons are longer and it is also not something that can enhance performance and so we don't really need to talk much more about it than that in terms of fat as a fuel source now here's the fundamental difference while carbohydrate starts anaerobically and finishes aerobically in the mitochondria you're using mostly ,0
the carbohydrate in the exercising muscle tissue eventually you can pull from blood and then you can pull from the liver with fat you have a tiny amount stored in the muscle intramuscular triglycerides but the overwhelming majority of fuel you get from fat comes systemically and so now we have a fundamental ,0
difference we actually literally have a Time problem I can get energy from carbohydrates faster because it is directly there if I go to pull it from fat I've got to pull it from the rest of the body which is why somebody who loses fat loses it from their entire body despite the fact that they may be only exercising a couple of parts so think ,0
about a runner someone who lost a lot of fat or running you don't see them just lose fat in their legs it comes from their face and their neck and everywhere why because what you're going to do is pull fat from the entire system you're going to break it down through a process called lipolysis which means you break it down from the ,0
stored form you put it in the blood as that glycerol backbone which is that three carbon backbone in the individual fatty acids it's going to float through the blood there's a seven step system here but we'll skip it for now it's going to have to get then uptaken into the muscle in the muscle then it has to get taken up and run into ,0
the mitochondria now that backbone that three carbon glycerol backbone is actually going to function almost exactly like the three carbon pyruvate just get it into the mitochondria cleave off one carbon run it as acetylch exact same thing super easy to metabolize small enough to go through ,0
the mitochondrial membrane the fatty acid chains become a problem so if you have a chain that's longer than or eight or so carbons it has to actually go through a special transporter on the cell wall to get in and that's going to be limited by a thing called carnitine and you're probably familiar with that ,0
as a supplement you may have talked about it there's a lot of places that make it that's going to be a limiting factor if it is a smaller what we call a short chain or even a medium chain triglyceride which a lot of folks have heard of MCT that's what we're talking about that can actually go directly through because it's small enough to ,0
pass through and you can use it immediately as an energy source in either case the way that you finally metabolize a fatty acid is a process where you would go through and cut off two carbons at a time why would you cut off too because you're trying to make that two carbon acetyl COA so you can run through ,0
that Krebs cycle again because you're cutting off two carbons at a time we have a special name for that oxidation process it's called beta oxidation that's exactly why we call it beta oxidation two carbons in you cut it off to make that acetalkoa so you can notice the oxidation pathway the electron transport ,0
pathway is identical whether you're talking about the carbohydrates or the fat in fact it doesn't even matter more to our point if we're talking about simply fat loss it really just is about running that electron transport chain whether it came from a carbohydrate or original Source or a fat original Source it ends up in the mitochondria as ,0
basically the exact same thing it then ends the end of metabolism as the same thing remember the final endpoint of carbohydrate metabolism is water ATP and CO2 do you want to guess the final endpoint of fat metabolism water ATP and CO2 so ,0
practical applications here if you want to maximize fat loss what type of training is best it really doesn't matter if you enjoy longer steady state stuff fantastic if you enjoy intervals amazing if you would like to do a combination that's my personal preference that's great too you have a ton of options pick ,0
what you think is a combination of challenging not all exercise should be easy but you will actually enjoy someone or you're willing to accept and anything that you absolutely hate don't do it sometimes is very very very difficult to do high intensity training you have to really be interested in ,0
doing it if not it ends up turning into like moderate intensity training you sort of just check the box and it doesn't work that well if you're just checking the box so if you're like man mentally I don't have it in me today to get to a high heart rate and throw up and all that stuff cool but you can just do some moderate steady state stuff well ,0
that's a win great if you're like oh my gosh more than 10 straight minutes and I'm so bored and you're all maybe you're also like I don't have 45 minutes I got to get this done in eight minutes great go do some high intense intervals either option will be equally effective as you mentioned earlier exercise is useful for aesthetic changes ,0
functionality and for longevity but when thinking about exercise specifically for fat loss I do have to ask this question I often hear from people that they prefer one type of exercise versus another for sake of fat loss because certain ,0
forms of exercise make them very hungry I'm wondering whether or not there's any relationship between the intensity or type of exercise and the hunger stimulus now I don't have this problem because basically everything makes me hungry um and yet I'm also okay fasting for part of the day yeah I'm one of those pseudo-intermittent fasters ,0
talk about what I mean by that I just happen to eat between 11 A.M and 8 PM naturally I'm not religious about it but um but I don't do it for any other reason except that that tends to be when I'm hungry and I exercise outside of that um in the morning typically in any case ,0
is there a way that people can determine what type of exercise might be better or worse for them based on its appetite stimulating or inhibiting effects because I also hear that you know some people will go for a long run and then they are quote unquote not hungry for several hours afterwards does that have anything to do with which fuels are ,0
being utilized during different forms of exercise that's actually a really good question I don't know the the mechanisms that can explain that answer what I can tell you is you hear the same comment for physical activity in other words people say man if I do this type of training then I just am exhausted and I lay around the ,0
rest of the day so my total caloric expenditure is actually compromised as an aggregate because I'm down um the data would suggest in general that doesn't happen so most of the time we don't see a reduction in physical activity um with either high intensity or steady state training in fact you generally see ,0
equal if not increased what's called need so it's the non-exercising part of your day in addition to the basal metabolic rate so physical activity wise you don't send to be prop now hunger is a little bit of a different thing the answer here is I don't think we have time to actually do justice on this so ,0
perhaps best to not get into this one yeah why don't we punt this down the road to our discussion about nutrition specifically and and weave back to it so we'll earmark it for that um meanwhile it sounds like if one is thinking purely in terms of uh burning calories yep and getting the health benefits of exercise to create a ,0
caloric deficit to create fat loss it doesn't matter whether or not they burn those calories using a form of exercise that relies predominantly on carbohydrate fat or protein correct it's not that it doesn't matter it's that either one will work because when we say things like that it's it doesn't mean they're actually ,0
identical there are some slight differences and maybe those differences are important for some people and not others ought to say is either one is a viable strategy great what about protein as a fuel as an actual feel so here let me give you an analogy ,0
imagine that you are you were with me a few weeks ago in southern Montana and we're out um in the wilderness for a week okay and it's cold out there and you needed to make a fire uh and if I said look you can pick any of these things there are so there's some wood over there we brought some ,0
newspaper and then we brought a match and we need to create a fire we're gonna use that fire to energy and heat up okay I said great the very first place you would probably start to make that fire is the match you like the match in any match hey it's going to light immediately but it's probably going to last 5 to 20 seconds I don't know before ,0
it burns out that's fossil creatine real fast real Burns Out if you were smart you would take that match and then light the newspaper on fire right now if you were to burn a whole newspaper it is more energy then you get to the match but you still you know I don't know what's going to take a few minutes some number of ,0
minutes before an entire 65 burns up five I don't know right depends on then yeah which type of newspaper it is I guess right amazing that's carbohydrate right if you were really smart you would use that to then light a piece of wood on fire and a wood if you've been in the wilderness it could last hours days it's ,0
really quite unlimited your phospho creatine storage is very limited small glycogen is a lot higher because you can store it in muscle you can store it in other places so you have more but not a lot fat is unlimited the average person if you're around say 70 kilos up 170 pounds or so and you're moderately lean maybe 15 body fat nothing crazy you ,0
probably have enough stored fat to create enough energy to survive for more than 30 days right this would literally be if you ingested zero calories you have enough fuel in your stored fat to keep you alive for certainly 30 days you wouldn't feel good and all those things but energetically basically fat ,0
will never ever be your limiting factor to Performance so when we start talking about well what limits my performance in these areas you can just wipe fat off the list it will never be your limiting factor to any type of endurance performance you simply have way too much the only problem with ,0
fat is is just too slow I've got to mobilize it I've got to get in the blood move it that whole thing too slow so if I want to go faster I will never be able to fully utilize fat which is why we talked about earlier you'll never see a situation in which somebody is a hundred percent burning fat as a fuel and no percent carbohydrate it's always going ,0
to be too slow highest you'll get maybe 70 so percent protein in this equation is none of that now you may notice how do you make paper what's fibrous you combine with water that you it gets pressed it gets compressed yeah yeah it's made from wood how do you make a match ,0
it's made from wood what's carbohydrate a chain of carbon what's fat a chain of carbon these are similar molecules right they're meant to give you pros and cons it's very difficult to just light a log on fire without a lot of work you'd have to burn burn burn burn burn so these are complementary systems that are really ,0
close to the same thing protein is none of those things protein is more like a piece of metal so if you were out in the woods with me and we were trying to make a fire and you're like hey look I found some old uh railroad over there let's throw that on there I would probably look at you like ,0
crazy now technically can you melt metal sure but you're gonna burn a lot of energy to try to get a little bit back out of the metal and now you've also cost yourself a very very valuable structure so protein is a fuel source for exercise or metabolism it's just an incredibly poor choice your body will do it again ,0
maybe five to ten percent but you now you're burning a very valuable Supply in a situation in which you don't know where there's ever going to be anymore remember protein is fairly transient it's you're not very good at storing it you can store a ton of carbohydrate and an unlimited literally amount of fat so you just really need to disregard ,0
thinking about protein as a fuel source your body does not want to do it you're not good at it you can go through a process of gluconeogenesis from protein make glucose from it is just very poor you're not going to get much out of the exchange and you've burned your supply of metal which is going to be very difficult it's a very high commodity in ,0
the woods or the Wilderness to have something like metal for people that consume very low carbohydrate or zero carbohydrate diets are they pulling more energy from muscle so which I imagine is a conversion of amino acids into ready carbon chains yeah I mean in this particular case once you've reached um a certain level of adaptation you've ,0
just gotten extremely good at generating glucose from other Fashions right so you can bias heavily towards fat adaptation the downside is and we've seen this born in literature you're going to perform slower so if you don't care about maximizing performance especially over something where it is a maximal effort for a few ,0
minutes or something then maybe you're not concerned and that's absolutely great especially for people just don't exercise then hey geez very little concern here but if you're interested in your performance and you're wondering why you're just like slugging it down well what you've done is you've down ,0
regulated the ability literally the enzymes responsible for that entire anaerobic glycolysis portion they get down regulated which means there's not as much around anymore and so you get really bad and slow at using carbohydrates as a fuel source so it's a very poor strategy for people on an anaerobic based sport or who like that ,0
type of activity again if you don't care no problem if you don't exercise at all then you really have no problem there which is actually why a high fat low carbohydrate nutrition strategy for people who don't do much physical activity is probably like very well it's very effective it is a really good strategy for weight management for ,0
energy stabilization throughout the day and the research would very much support that in my observation I would agree I've tried low carbohydrate diets of severely limiting or completely eliminating carbohydrate and after about two or three days I feel pretty lousy but mostly because I want to train very intensely in the gym in ,0
addition to doing longer runs I tend to do all of those things across the week yeah but I've also observed and in fact know several people that love the very low carbohydrate AKA ketogenic type diet they're not doing ketogenic diets for mental health reasons per se but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot of ,0
long endurance but low intensity long endurance these are the I walk to get my exercise types and they do indeed walk a lot and some of them manage to control their weight very readily and like that diet for that reason um when we had Lane Norton on the podcast he pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight you have to ,0
restrict something either of course time or macronutrients Etc to arrive at that sub caloric threshold get below the the sub maintenance threshold I guess one of the things I want to point out is this should be received as again not a this is better or worse this is just you now have a ton of options so whatever personal preference other ,0
factors you get to craft this strategy of performance Aesthetics and health based on your personal preferences at this point I'd like to go back to our classic list of nine adaptations that exercise can induce the first four of course being largely largely unrelated to today's conversation but that we're covered in ,0
the episode that we did on strength speed and hypertrophy so just to remind people the nine adaptations are number one skill and technique two speed three power which is speed times Force four strength and five hypertrophy today we're talking about the remaining adaptations on that list starting with muscular endurance ,0
followed by anaerobic capacity followed by maximal aerobic output and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise so if we could start with muscular endurance this would be number six on the list of nine adaptations muscular endurance how do I build muscular endurance why ,0
should I build muscular endurance and just to remind me what fuel sources are predominating when I'm training for muscular endurance great so remember muscular endurance is something that's going to be generally in a local muscle it is not a cardiovascular or systemic issue and it tends to be something in the neighborhood of say five to maybe ,0
even up to 50 repetitions so this is the classic example we'll give here is how many push-ups can you do in a row most people are going to land somewhere in that range I just said how many sit-ups can you do in a minute how many pull-ups how long can you hang on a bar um as a dead hang things like that that's muscular endurance muscular ,0
endurance is not a mild run or a marathon or anything like that so uh how long can I stand without breaking posture this is muscular endurance a plank a wall sit great yes love all these things okay now the reason I took you on that big long metabolism Journey is so I could help you understand exactly how to ,0
train this Factor any of these factors with a more comprehensive understanding of what's Happening meaning thinking back to metabolism if I'm going to ask my triceps to do 50 push-ups in a row what's going to be my limiting factor am I going to run out of fat ,0
no chance am I going to run out of glycogen no chance that's way too few of repetitions you have a lot left there so what's going to be the thing that stops me from getting 51 repetitions either you're going to have too high of a pH rise so too much acid build up or you're going to have a problem clearing the waste ,0
so really this is two factors dealing with acid buildup and getting acid out of the muscle tissue and end of circulation because you have plenty of ability to handle that small amount of acid buildup in your entire body it's just you can't handle it in that tiny spot now I picked the tricep for a very specific reason ,0
you're gonna deal with more pain when you use a large muscle group like your quads or your glutes than you are with a small muscle group for example nobody ever threw up after arm day but a lot of people throw up after leg day why is that look at the total amount of waste that you're dumping into your system when you have quadrupled or 10x ,0
the muscle size small muscle groups are only really going to be challenged in that local area large ones will dump so much waste into the system that you'll want to avoid that as quickly as possible and that's one of the reasons why you throw up after Hard Exercise great so the reason I'm laughing because I don't ,0
think I've ever thrown up uh from a weight training session and so it's making me wonder if I've ever trained that hard I've received uh or obtained the progress that I've wanted to do generally over time not every week every workout every month but certainly over the 30 plus years that I've been weight training I've achieved the results I've ,0
wanted I have however vomited after a long run when I didn't hydrate well oh or if I drink too much water sure oh sure too much water yeah you'll you'll get that out quick right I just uh want to be clear because I think some people are getting the picture that if they're not vomiting then after their leg workout ,0
that they're not training according to uh your standards Again by the way um Dr Andy Galvin runs experiments in his lab he's recruiting subjects [Laughter] also known as my graduate students that's right in any event sorry to interrupt uh but I felt it was the necessary Interruption so muscular ,0
endurance there's plenty of fuel plenty of fuel you manage acid buildup and you also need to get that fuel out of you that's going to be a capitalization issue so the way that we can think about this is capillaries surround your muscle and the whole point of them is so that blood can come into them they hit this ,0
capitalization that actually slows the diffusion rate of blood down and so you can exchange nutrients in and get waste products out and then we get things back into circulation so the more of those you have the better you are at dispersing any of these waste products build up whether it's CO2 or the acid so the adaptation you're looking for here ,0
is an increase in capitalization potentially a slight increase in mitochondria but the time is too fast right so we're going to be able to need to do these 50 repetitions and say under a minute or something like that so getting the mobilization into the mitochondria getting fuel that way too slow it's not really going to get our ,0
performance here so what are strategies to increase acid buffering ability and then capitalization so on the capitalization side you simply need to train at that ability so you go close to failure and practice that often that alone will increase increase blood flow ,0
to that local area which will take you through your process of increasing capitalization easy peasy specificity just to briefly interrupt I find it remarkable although not surprising giving how amazing the human body is that simply by doing some movement repeat like a wall set or a uh or push-ups or dips for that matter ,0
repeatedly over and over and over until you reach that failure Point yep or that quaking point in the case of a wall set that provides a stimulus for more capillaries to be built into the system literally the the production or the um the trafficking of endothelial cells which make up the capillaries and allow basically more little pipes to feed the ,0
system with oxygen and remove waste products it's like irrigation right imagine you had a giant field and you had two big pipes running down the outside well in fact if you want to make sure water gets evenly dispersed across the entire field you'll have a bunch of offshooting little pipes and the more those you have the more coverage you get ,0
do we know what the specific signal is that says hey I failed at this we need more capillaries I actually don't know what that is I could I would speculate It's a combination of um acidity as well as carbon dioxide and probably some nitric oxide stuff happening there but I actually don't ,0
know I'm guessing nobody knows for sure because we still don't know for instance what the exact signal is for hypertrophy it's kind of an amazing situation we know the requirements for getting the results that we want yeah but we still don't know what the specific signal is um in any event what I'm hearing is building more capillaries is great for ,0
enhancing muscular endurance and the way to get more capillaries into those muscles is to train for muscular endurance by getting close to failure or to some point where you simply can't continue for whatever reason could you give us an example of what a reasonable training protocol ,0
might be in terms of the classic Galpin lists now exercise Choice maybe a few options order volume and frequency great what should we be doing how often should we be doing it and you know for instance should I do wall sets to failures and push-ups to failure given that this is a local process I'm guessing that if I do ,0
push-ups to failure I'm not going to increase the number of capillaries in my legs very much correct so you nailed it exercise choice is high Precision here so pick the muscle group and the exact sequencing and movement pattern you want High Precision this is the thing if you want to get better at applying hold the plank you're going to ,0
do more push-ups two more push-ups you can do some other stuff that's complementary but really this is a high Precision game do the exact same thing for exercise Choice very simple there okay in terms of exercise order I suppose this dovetails with volume yeah can I combine um training let's say wall sets for my ,0
quads and real you know nearby muscle groups and then do push-ups to failure uh and then also do some sort of um pulling exercise to failure yep absolutely again pick the exercises you want the movement patterns you want to do and do them the order almost doesn't matter with the one caveat with larger muscle groups particularly again ,0
multiple leg activities that will induce a small amount of systemic fatigue and so if you I guess theoretically wanted to maximize your push-up number and you did a whole bunch of say split squats and you just did those and and you you know did lunges for a mile or something like that you might actually slightly ,0
compromise you might not but you might slightly compromise your ability to do as many pull-ups in a row or hold a bend over row or something like that so if you really cared about that level then you maybe want to do the one thing that's most important first in general my recommendation though is to do the bigger muscle group first how many sets ,0
and how often should one perform training for muscular endurance and when now the lovely part here is we've moved down the Spectrum past hypertrophy you don't need a lot of load here in fact the load only needs to be at or slightly above what you want to move so if you want to get better at ,0
moving 50 of your one rep max you don't really need to train much more than 50 maybe 55 or 60 percent of your one or Max because if you go higher than that the repetition count is going to fall and you're no longer going to be training muscular endurance so you just need to stay right around that number that you want to work on so again if the ,0
target is doing more pull-ups and assuming that you have the strength to do it you check that box you simply need to practice the repetition range that you want to be in that's all it takes you can repeat that a number of times but because remember the volume is fairly low the load is very very low you can actually repeat these quite ,0
frequently so you won't get extremely sore from muscular endurance relative to traditional hypertrophy straining because the load is very very light so you can do these more frequently if you would like more frequently such as you could do it three or four times a week easy if you would like you don't necessarily need to ,0
three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here um if you wanted to do more sets on a given day and do less days that would be fine so if you want to do two days a week and you say wanted to do let's say you could do 25 push-ups and the goal is to get to 30 push-ups just as an example you might say okay I'm gonna do sets of ,0
17. and I'm going to do three sets of that I'm gonna do that three days a week that's going to build up quite a bit or you could say look I'm gonna do a set basically to failure I'm going to recover and do one or two sets that say 80 percent and I'll do that twice a week ,0
that's going to push the pace pretty well you're going to have a lot of gains from that and again this is not about hypertrophy this is about muscular endurance so I do want to emphasize and again please correct me if I'm um talking out of line here I do want to emphasize that because we mentioned pull-ups if you ,0
can't get 25 pull-ups then and you're doing 10 you're training for hypertrophy you're not training for muscular endurance personally remember there's a big cross over here so anytime we're talking past like 15 reps we're technically in hypertrophy and muscular endurance got it so here's the common mistake ,0
I don't want to get bulky so I'm I'm gonna go lighter and do more reps and then people grow and then you landed still right in the middle of hypertri rank right so like for people who are like oh my gosh like every time I lift weights I blow up I go lighter I do more reps and I you're still writing the ,0
hypertrophy song they'd actually be much better off training very very heavy in the one to three rep range they'd get really strong and they wouldn't grow much exactly so tell me if this is a reasonable protocol for what I'm going to call the typical person in my mind the typical person is somebody who hopefully is ,0
doing resistance training hitting that 10 sets per muscle group per week minimum yep to maintain or build strength and hypertrophy but is also doing some long duration training that we'll talk about in a little bit maybe throwing in uh high intensity workout here there some ,0
Sprints maybe some plyometrics some skill based training they're doing a bunch of different things to be all what I would call All Around fit yeah they're not training for any specific event or trying to maximize any one of the nine adaptations to the exclusion of the others that person decide okay after ,0
um they do their longer run they're gonna do uh Max time a plank to Max duration they're going to do a wall set to Max duration and they're going to do push-ups to Max duration and then also do that same workout before they do their high intensity interval training some other point during the week and ,0
then maybe even do it uh again um on their so-called rest day just a real quick five minutes of sure and in doing so build more capillaries into the relevant muscle groups and build their muscular endurance yep without eating into their overall recovery too much too much yeah so again the nice part about this is they don't Hammer you too much ,0
you're not going to get tremendously sore if you keep the load light the only switch I'd make there is I would probably do them after your interval rather than before so you can make sure you keep quality there and you're not compromised by a local muscular endurance when you're actually trying to get a more systemic fatigue with ,0
something like a higher intensity interval training so that would work fantastic the only other variable we have in it on here is progression and this is very simple try to add a rep or two per week that's really all you have to go after so if you're up to 22 this week try to hit 23 next week or for wall sits and ,0
planks that would be added add time time yep and if and if you run into a wall there just like the same Concepts we talked about with strength or hypertrophy back it down to more like in the 80 or 85 range and accumulate a lot more practice that's going to help a lot with capitalization as well as asset ,0
buffering so you're going to continue to give yourself signals for up regulation of the processes needed for that and it's not always pushing you to the end failure just like we don't want to always go to failure with strength we don't want to always go to failure with high intensity intervals either same thing would be happening here ,0
what about anaerobic capacity how should people train for anaerobic capacity what exactly are they training for meaning what is the structural or seller adaptation or adaptations that are occurring that allow for increases in anaerobic capacity and why are increases in anaerobic capacity good for us even if we're a quote unquote endurance ,0
athlete or we are a recreational exerciser who is not interested in building more muscle speed or things that I typically associate with anaerobic capacity yeah so this is really really fun remember anaerobic capacity is the total amount of work you can do for something like seconds to a few minutes and this ,0
is extremely high levels of fatigue the highest you're really going to see and by fatigue here I mean acid buildup byproducts not fatigue is in like mentally I don't want to do this anymore so if we just think about the energetic for a second I'm gonna do say let's take a really easy example of people have done that ,0
thing where you uh you'll go to the track and you sprint the straightaways and you walk the corners remember that sort of thing yeah uh tabatas 30 on 30 off things like this like this is what we're talking about in this kind of anaerobic capacity area now here's what's going to happen is fat going to be your limiting no we've ,0
already made that clear right what about carbohydrates well if it's a single bout or a two or three bouts probably not but if you're doing this for a long time say you're going to go 30 on 30 off for 20 rounds you may actually start reaching a point of running out of my muscle glycogen in any of those cases though you're ,0
going to be running into an acid problem if you were to continue to do this multiple repetitions in addition to running low and muscle glycogen you're also going to start running into oxygen transportation problems because you're building up a lot of byproducts you've got to continue you will actually cruise into aerobic ,0
glycolysis this is exactly why the community that I have worked a lot with professional fighters very high level boxers world champions UFC fighters it is a five minute round that you're going to do five times this is for world championship fights you get one minute break in between so imagine going like 30 on 30 off for five minutes ,0
getting a one minute break and doing that five times even though the individual ballots are 30 seconds long the entire thing lasts so long it is primarily aerobic you have to have both capacities you got to get really high anaerobic you also have to have a lot of aerobic going on you have you're going to start running ,0
into limitations because of heart rate stroke volume and then even potentially ventilation the need for oxygen to be able to come in and clear the carbon dioxide totally out of the system becomes a problem because not only are you having so much build up for such a long time you're also using multiple muscle groups so now ,0
this is a very important distinction muscular endurance tends to be localized now this is not right if you're doing these intervals you're on an assault bike you're sprinting up a hill you're grappling with somebody you have a lot of muscles being involved which means all of that waste is being dumped into the central ,0
part you have to clear it and I'm by clearance I now mean not out of the muscle I mean out of the body so your ability to bring in and utilize oxygen is going to be a major limitation to your ability to handle this stuff so what do you do well specificity wins practice the exact thing you're talking about so if you ,0
want to get better at sprinting the straightaways and walking the corners do that you can't always do it though you're going to run into limitations so this is when backing off to a lower intensity is going to give you a lot of benefits we know very clearly if you want to improve cardiovascular fitness high ,0
intensity moderate intensity and low intensity are effective and you actually probably want to do a little bit of all of them this is why none of our Fighters would ever just do high intensity training there's going to be some moderate we tend to call this like cardiac output training you can think of this as like ,0
anywhere between Zone 2 to zone four if you like zones I don't use them personally so I'm just going to intentionally interrupt you because this issue of zones has come up a few times I want to make sure everybody's on the same page you also mentioned that you don't necessarily favor the Zone nomenclature but for those not familiar ,0
Zone one two three four all the way up to five is a kind of uh back of the envelope uh type verbiage for some people and is more precisely followed by for other people meaning for me uh Zone one is simply walking uh easy walking zone two would be for anybody the ,0
Pace or intensity of exercise that one could perform while still maintaining a conversation but just barely meaning if you were to push any harder then it would be difficult to hold that conversation then you'd be in zone three and then zone three four five as I understand them are a little bit vague but maybe you could give us a sense of ,0
the breathing patterns associated with each of the zones so that people could map to those uh when we discuss Zone one through five uh and as I say all this I certainly um tip my hat to all of those people out there who like to measure percent of maximum heart rate they like to use heart rate monitors ,0
um they're using any number of different devices I sometimes use those devices but in general I tend not to and I use my breathing as a Rough Guide of which zone I'm in so before we go back to specific protocols for anaerobic capacity tell me how you think about Zone one through five and how people might be ,0
able to assess whether or not they are in zone one two three or four or five great so zone five is that absolute top thing and we can flag ourselves there I liked how you flagged one and two the distinction between three four and five I'm less concerned with either uh we will do some heart rate stuff but not to identify what zone we're in ,0
um the fact is the distinction between those zones is basically just made up right that not that it's fake but there's no like rationale there it's a little bit like perceived effort and weightlifting you know how are you at 100 output or 70 you know when you're at zero and you know when you're at 100 in that moment but ,0
the difference between 60 and 70 is anybody's guess totally so we use or the relevance right so why does it matter if I'm at 60 or 70. is there actual difference there's not right so it doesn't really matter in that regard um if you're a very highly trained particularly cyclist things like that then and you can control a lot of ,0
circumstances those things start to make a lot more sense um but when you're in an open environment like the athletes I deal with just not gonna it's not gonna matter that much so the way that I approach this is and I will use this word intentionally stolen directly from Brian McKenzie and ,0
his company shift adapt they use what's called a gear system and I absolutely love it it's what we've been using for a long time so with Brian with your permission I'm going to take it right now thank you Brian he gave me the permission to thank you Brian Brian's a good friend of of ours and I do think the breathing gear ,0
system is a terrific way to think about the zones and to get a good sense of what zone one happens to be yeah great so um the first gear is your ability to Simply breathe in and out through your nose at a set Cadence so basically regardless of how hard you're working can you restrict your breathing to like a two to three second inhale ,0
and then a two to three second exhale and this is really clever actually because a lot of folks will jump immediately into an over breathing strategy which means you'll be ventilating more than you need which actually sends that rer up higher than it needs to be which kicks you higher into carbohydrate ,0
utilization if you're supposed to be in quote unquote Zone one you're trying to be efficient not fast so using more carbohydrates than you need is not beneficial here you're walking for the day you're out on a longer hike you're enjoying the day you shouldn't be trying to ramp up carbohydrate metabolism it should be ,0
all right and so this would be getting into an argument with somebody while on a long walk you feel exhausted afterwards and over breathing yeah totally right okay yeah so you should be able to breathe at a specific Cadence and generally people are um doing that more frequently than they need right zone two uh rather gear two ,0
is inhaling and exhaling at whatever rate you needed to be but still nasal only so it is a force right whatever you need to do but your mouth is closed the entire time you've shifted higher up you're burning more and more carbohydrate as the fuel source but you're still able to control ,0
that and restrict the nasal breathing now gear three and four which is our final ones there's no gear five gear uh three and four is like a subtle strength and I actually don't even care about the difference there I basically use gear one two and then S4 but you're basically talking about either a nose to mouth strategy ,0
or a straight up mouth mouth right so breathing in through the nose out through the mouth if you can control it that way you can do the opposite actually right can you breathe in and out through your nose but the classic one people do is enter the nose out the mouth um again I really don't even care about ,0
distinction I basically jump from two to four Brian May do it differently I don't actually know um four is just mouth mouth right and this is the case in most sporting applications you're going to be breathing because the nose is restricted right there's only so much space and as we ,0
talked about earlier the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or CO2 exhalation if you're restricting that this is going to be problematic so in your actual competition please go to the mouth if you need to right we practice a lot trying to stay nasal only for as long as possible but that's going to eventually happen when you're doing your ,0
high intensity intervals and you're really going as hard as you can you're going to have to go to your mouth unless you're an absolute Freakazoid and you can say in your nose but that's not going to happen right most people can't get past say 70 or 80 percent while breathing through your nose um I know some people can get higher but ,0
that's the general distinction so we pay much more attention to those particular gears than we do heart rate zones and zone five would be just pure mouth breathing all out and then running into your life the gear system is just one to four there's no fifth gear got it so the gear four would again be mouth mouth breathing as much in as you can ,0
breathing as much as you can out got it and I I appreciate your description of of the gear system and how it um roughly relates to the zones we've been talking about also um I'm reminded if anyone wants to experience the relationship between breathing in the offloading of carbon dioxide and your ability to exert effort ,0
in anything a game that a friend of mine sometimes likes to play when we walk or Jog and talk is he'll say let's just hold our breath now until we hit that piling or that um uh lifeguard stand on the beach and within seconds you actually can start to panic absolutely also becomes very hard to coordinate your action after a little ,0
while again be really careful with this but but it will teach you in a moment in a very real world way how important it is to be able to offload carbon dioxide because you're probably not running out of oxygen at those lower intensities no questions You're simply building up carbon dioxide and that gas reflex is screaming to go off and you're actively ,0
suppressing it yeah so the interesting test here is your CO2 Tolerance on Ryan's website you can go directly there you can there's a video to how to run this test and then you can put in your numbers and it'll tell you sort of exactly what to do as a result of it but the CO2 tolerance test is a test of exactly what you just mentioned so you ,0
should be fairly tolerant in other words non-reactive can be responsive but non-reactive two elevations in CO2 so you should see them and feel them but you should be choosing how you respond rather than adding a reaction um there are interesting data looking at things like out of the blue panic ,0
attacks you can actually notice those in blood via rises in CO2 up to 45 minutes prior to the event happening so there are signals happening in your body that you may be sensitive or not sensitive to the more in tune you can get with that the better your life is going to be and even if we're specifically just talking about ,0
exercise performance so it's okay for CO2 to rise it's going to rise it's a byproduct of anaerobic anaerobic metabolism it's a byproduct of carbohydrate and fat metabolism as we've established it's going to get there you're going to feel that however if you immediately go into a panic because of a small increase in CO2 ,0
this is a problem so returning to anaerobic capacity this morning we were training not together I couldn't keep up with your workout but I uh but in the same uh General space and I did my once a week maximum heart rate uh one minute Sprint on the assault bike sometimes I'll do more minutes uh meaning I will do a one minute then take some rest and ,0
do another minute after some rest but I decided to do that one minute with you there so I could learn from you and indeed um I have to assume that that was largely within the anaerobic capacity Realm the first 30 seconds or so were manageable we're getting more and more ,0
painful there was a quit signal going off in my head you said there's real magic that occurs around second 40 and indeed somewhere around second 40 for whatever reason it seemed easier but at the one minute Mark I was happy to stop because I was really at at least what fell to me uh 100 output yeah is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic ,0
capacity keeping in mind what you said before which is that specificity or precision as you've raised it um is important that is if I want to train uh anaerobic capacity for sprinting I probably should have been sprinting cycling I was I was on the assault bike um and so on ,0
how many of those one minute all out Sprints or 30 second all-out sprints on the on the bike could and should one perform per workout and per week so marching through exercise Choice yep let's do it um order volume frequency and progression yep choice of exercises train for what you want to improve is ,0
that right not necessarily so in this particular case if you have a specific goal yes of course Do It um exercise Choice a couple of things you want to look for you want to pick something that you feel extremely confident in the movement with because you're going to forget your ,0
brain very quickly here because you're going to go into our pain cave okay so if you're not comfortable running don't go run here you're never going to get to the spot we need to get to it if you're not comfortable or if every time you you go on a rower your low back hurts the next day don't do it if you're not comfortable ,0
using kettlebell swings you get the point don't do an exercise you're not comfortable with you also secondarily want to be carefully cautious of heavy eccentric loads because you're going to be doing a lot of repetitions at a high intensity so this is where I love an assault bike this is why a rower is great swimming is ,0
amazing running uphill generally more favorable than running on normal ground especially if you're not Runner don't run downhill that's a lot of eccentric load I don't love things like box jumps here right because again a lot of eccentric loading if suppose you can jump up land on the box step down but now you're ,0
you're again you're too many things are going in your mind I don't want to slip and fall I don't want to smash my on the box what happens if I'm too many variables pick something that is safer where you can really focus on your breathing and your posture and the performance ,0
all right so that's exercise Choice and then within that if there's some specific thing you want to get better at go ahead do it okay how many different movements meaning should I do the assault bike and then uh some form of safe executable uh overhead pressing um it's a little hard it's a little ,0
harder to imagine um anaerobic capacity for the upper body unless you have access to a skier or one of these um what are those things called the climber machines yeah the reversal climber the Versa climber that's the one the Versa climber um you can tell how often I do that one uh it's a great exercise so great piece ,0
of exercise equipment yeah so we're thinking how many how many how many exercises and in what order is it going to be two or three exercises since you're involving a lot of muscle groups typically that's a really distinction generally these are going to be total body movements so you can do something like a ski org if you want to ,0
really isolate your upper body great love that you can do lower body isolation like cycling right where everybody's not involved you can use weights here you can do some barbell movements and stuff like that they're just not my favorite choices for most people too many complexity things going on so ,0
uh I generally am going to pick total body movements uh pushing a sled dragging a sled sprinting uphill swimming these things like that are going to be good I'm seeing now why the assault bike is such a powerful tool because you're using your arms with some degree of resistance but not a lot of eccentric load plus legs some resistance ,0
not a lot of eccentric load and yet one can go quote unquote all out for 30 to 60 seconds yep and and the consequences of a technical breakdown are minimal it's more like you're gonna actually have a worse performance rather than an injury rate so there's just a wonderful invention uh because of that where other things the consequences like say if ,0
you're going to be doing a barbell or kettlebell activity the consequences of making a technical mistake you might actually get an acute injury right there so they're just a little bit higher in the risk scale how many sets or sometimes referred to as repeats so how many 30 to 60 second all out sprints again doesn't have to be ,0
running sprinting but all out effort would be the better way to phrase it should I perform let's say per week right and then decide whether or not we can divide those up across multiple workouts or whether or not it's better to do them in the same workout yeah if you're staying with the same exercise for all of your workouts ,0
that's a little bit different answer than if you're if you're modifying them so say you're going to do this three times a week and you're gonna do an air bike one day you're gonna do some Hill Sprints another day and then you can do some swimming another day for sake of example I'm going to say um same movement ,0
because I think most people are going to be most comfortable with one or two types of movements unless they are really coordinated or an excellent athlete I think most people can probably find a hill that they could run up yeah and uh an aerodyne or assault bike a rower things of that sort yep you're gonna ,0
have a pro and a con here so the pro of doing less sets is you can actually train much closer to truly 100 percent the downside is volume slow okay so a major mistake people make here is they'll do something like um I'll do 20 seconds on 10 seconds off and I'll do that for 40 rounds you're not really actually going that ,0
hard on those 20 seconds so a key in fact if you look at the literature and all the buzz and all the positive benefits of high intensity neural training that assumes you are actually hitting very close to 100 percent if you're sliding down into like again moderate training stuff you start to actually be in a spot where you're not ,0
getting the total high-end stuff but you're not doing it long enough to get the low end stuff either and so you end up in this like you burn some calories you probably still enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and a little bit of capitalization but you didn't really justify only doing three rounds ,0
that's where the problem comes in so in terms of a couple of protocols I'll give you how many sets per week it's it's really hard to give a number unlike the strength training stuff where it was easy to kind of land some stuff on a typical thing you'll see is like a minimum dose tends to be something like four rounds per day three times per week ,0
wow that's a lot so my once a week all-out effort of sprinting on the assault bike the so-called Airline bike for 60 seconds one to three rounds of that might be doing something useful for me but I should probably be doing that two or three times a week if you're gonna get to a max heart rate I ,0
generally like to say give me a minimum of one day a week two's better days per week how many rounds whatever it takes you to get to that maximum heart rate right so in your case you did one minute okay good if you're gonna extend past a minute or two one round might be enough so for example uh if you want to just do something ,0
where I'm going to run a mile as fast as I can that's all you need to do for the day you don't need to do multiple you can do mile repeats if you'd like but that is really really challenging I know we've extended the time duration here but I wanted to go there to show you the time domain matters here if you're doing something like a 20 second burst ,0
you're going to need more rounds if you're doing something longer like multiple minutes you don't need as many rounds to get there so in addition if you're really reaching past this um 90 seconds of of Hell window it's just going to do a lot more damage to the system not damaging than bad but as in there's a lot to recover here so ,0
we need more recovery time from that a 20 second burst doesn't really challenge you challenge you in that 20 seconds but you'll be recovered and fine a three minute thing is going to hurt and it's going to hurt for many many minutes after that and you're going to still see maybe some performance decrements the next day ,0
depending on what your recovery stuff looks like so a couple of things to pay play with would be something like this if you want to try like a classic 30 seconds on 30 seconds off protocol the literature will show like a minimum of four rounds of that probably three days a week so 30 seconds all out 30 seconds rest is one round repeat that four times ,0
at least once a week at least two would be better great right if you want to go something a lot longer than that you might be able to get away with one but generally two days a week of this is better if you start actually pushing past like three to four days a week up to five or six you may actually be causing some problems ,0
um there's just a little bit of excess fatigue that's going to happen there that you you maybe want to stay away from in fact you can see a lot of endocrinological problems and some other sleep issues and some other things kick in and we'll talk about more of those things as later but um that's the number to get with if you want to try something ,0
more like a 20 second burst I actually would recommend giving yourself more rest so you can actually do a higher rest than work ratio most people tend to think of this as doing like one to one 20 seconds on 20 seconds off or lower I love doing like 20 seconds on 40 seconds off ,0
the quality of that 20 seconds becomes extraordinarily high and it's also possible to now get like six to eight rounds so as I'm hearing this I'm going to wager a uh an offer uh to you and if you say Okay um then to to those listening based on what you're telling me about the relationship between intensity and ,0
quality and the need for sufficient duration of this anaerobic work yeah how is five to six minutes per week of all out work that's pretty good so what that means for me is I would do three all out one minute sprints on one workout separated by a minute or ,0
two maybe more and I would do that two or three times per week just trying to hit that five or six minute per week threshold yep actually I think uh one of the uh Marty gabala is the scientist a Canadian uh guy amazing work he was done a lot of ,0
the the research on high intensity interval stuff right and I think the number he actually threw out there is some of his original research was comparing six total minutes of work to upwards of like 180 minutes of work throughout um the entire week and and one of the classic studies was looking at VO2 max ,0
improvements and he saw equal if not greater improving civil to Max with that so I think actually the name of his book might be like the six minute workout or something and so you'd like may have nailed that directly on the head uh purely by law but actually but I also may be wrong with the numbers we should probably fact check that yeah Will and ,0
also by inference from what you were saying you know if you're going to do this 20 seconds on 40 seconds off and you're doing more rounds or one minute all out so the way I'm going to think about this if it's okay with you is for five to six minutes a week I am sprinting yeah for my life correct but I'm sprinting for my life with good ,0
form in whatever movement I happen to be doing and I can do all of that in one workout but I'm separating out bouts of 20 seconds all the way up to one minute yep by the necessary rest in order to recover my breathing get back to Pure nasal breathing maybe Zone one zone totally totally and then hit it again if you're gonna do the one minute thing ,0
like you do I actually generally encourage one to three minutes of rest before you do the next round and probably up to four to six rounds that would be your six minute number there now the caveat there is we don't worry about heart rate recovery we worry about exactly what you mentioned which is nasal only recovery once you can get ,0
back to that give yourself another 30 seconds or so and then you're ready to go for round two this is where it gets fun because I can imagine challenging myself to get on the assault bike for one minute of kind of warm-up very low intensity each morning and then Sprint for a minute and then head off into my daily routine no okay that ,0
if you're going to do that though you need to give me three minutes of nasal only breathing before you go back to work we need to download and there are people in my life that would love for me to engage in more nasal breathing because it will have me speaking less so no problem chances are I'm going to use the ,0
um two or three workouts per week of a one minute all out maybe I'll try the shorter protocol can I give you one fun protocol to try here please so if you have a you can use this on any equipment um but I learned this from another mutual friend Kenny Kane this is a great little it's a little test a little a little game you can play with yourself ,0
and the only way to play this game is you're going to lose which is really really lovely so you can do this at any rate you can do this for any duration of time but two minutes is a good number Okay so you have to do this in somewhere where you can no distance so this could be running cycling the the air bike is what I use ,0
the first two minutes you're going to cover as much distance as you can possibly cover in two minutes and you're going to note that so let's say you covered 400 meters right okay great you're going to rest for two minutes amazing that next round you're now going ,0
clear that same intervention was able to improve post-planned yell glucose control insulin and a whole bunch of other factors in addition to that so if you are the sort of type who's like wow I'm in an office all day maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal not the best approach but a little bit of mitigation there can just be running up ,1
do this all the time in my house when you you know have those days when you're on like seven straight hours of zooms Etc you can get out of 20 seconds I run to my garage which is over there I hop on the the airbike and I will just smash out 30 seconds as fast as I can and then walk right back in love it yeah ,1
exercise and in particular if you're following a very clean diet that is not a lot of processed foods which of course is a good thing chances are you're not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science-backed ratio of 1 000 milligrams that's one gram of sodium 200 milligrams ,1

thermodynamics of energy utilization governs most everything that is if I'm ingesting less caloric energy than I burn then I'm going to lose weight and if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn I'll maintain weight and if I ingest more then I burn then I'll gain weight sure that is the ,1
breathe in O2 breathe out CO2 they do the opposite well what happens is because carbohydrates are long chains of carbon and fats are as well generally when we think about fats by the way it's important to understand that structure a little bit so if we think about triglycerides it is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol so one two ,1
three and horizontally running off of each one of those are fatty acid chains right so we form this structure that looks like an e right like the letter e three in the back and then three chains coming off of it each of those chains are called fatty acids and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon right or a number of carbons strung together ,1
fat generally in adipose tissue we'll put a little bit in muscle cells as intramuscular triglycerides and then the protein will use as structure right to do different things we don't like to use protein as material or fuel it's better used as structure and what we have to do then is if all of a sudden we realize that storage is getting too much in our ,1
body in other words we're gaining too much weight we have to figure out how to get the carbons out of our body and that is metabolism right anytime we're trying to break a carbon bonds though we can get energy to make ATP that's going to release the carbon out of our tissue into the blood we have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon ,1
spidey sense have to has to be going off in your brain where like there has to be something linking these things and what's linking it is simply carbon Exchange so put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling more than you and inhaling without passing out the other problem is if you were to ,1
Simply do a breathing protocol while the rate of exhalation would go up after that you would correct and go in the opposite direction so that's the problem is your net carbon the output over the course today is not going to change unless you increase the demand for energy and that's how you get into that negative state ,1
can offload more CO2 okay carbons per exhale are you a more efficient fat loss machine it's a wonderful thought and the answer would be no not something you worry about because if you were to Exhale more carbon than actually needed now we're in a state of inefficiency ,1
cardiac output will only adjust for energetic changes all right energy requirements in the acute moment right how much do I need go which is going to be determined by ventilation right how much air am I bringing in and putting out that's going to determine cardiac output and that's going to determine where we're at if you were to do like a ,1
sub maximal exercise test when you were unfit to when you're fit or when you're fit the way you're super fit at sub Max you're going to see the same thing cardiac output will be identical and you're like damn nothing happened what you're not realizing is your heart rate at that same workload is now lower ,1
intensity exercise the second you stop you're right back down to resting ventilation no problem because you were able to match the need for energy with the offload of waste one to one during that exercise when you start creeping up the intensity you can't do that so you have to basically start stealing a little bit of fuel here so even though ,1
um you should probably beat about that that's a kind of a good number to think um honestly but people will understand a little bit about metabolism to be dangerous but not enough we'll we'll throw out these terms like fat adapted and fat adapted is a real thing but is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes right it is this idea thinking like I ,1
can get into a spot where I'm maximizing fat burning maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise and maximizing fat loss over time are not the same thing at all right that's the confusion so if you enhance fat oxidation and exercise that does not enhance fat loss per se ,1
that's it's your first sign of light on defense if you need glucose outside of that you're going to start pulling it from the blood but one of the things your body regulates a handful of things over almost everything blood pH blood glucose blood pressure and electrolyte concentrations like it really does not want to mess with those ,1
things at all it will change almost anything else in the body to keep those things standardized right you generally because you need all those things for your brain to work and your brain will stop working right if you lose blood pressure it won't go up there pH changes you can't run metabolism electrolytes change you can't think and glucose is a ,1
you're still going to add fat if you burn a muscle glycogen and you're hypochloric you're going to lose fat right think about it this way you're in a negative calorie state where are those calories going to come from are you going to reduce your muscle glycogen storages permanently no no are you going to reduce your glycogen ,1
that there is absolutely no way to complete carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen that has to happen the only way to engage in fat metabolism is aerobic and oxygen there's no anaerobic component to it there's a fundamental difference there so the your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible it is the primary ,1
fuel source for a reason your fat is not meant to be flexible it is meant to be Unlimited that's the basic point so you want flexibility over here and an unlimited capacity over there now I'm safeguarded against any energetic need okay I need to run up a hill for safety cool carbohydrates are there I need to then run for 17 hours cool fat is there ,1
to up regulate your ability to use fat as a fuel and so this is like there's a saturation point outside of that Spectrum most people just say hey like I want to feel great throughout the day to be able to do a bunch of different things how do you know a couple things there's a lot of biological markers you ,1
something like that before we go to sleep around 10 10 30 or so yeah so it's not you know midnight uh bowls of pasta I've done that too but um but typically it's not so I think that um people will be very interested uh myself included in how meal timing relates to all of this but um yeah let's ,1
lactate lactic acid this is that whole system right again I'm skipping some steps making a little bit of mistakes here intentionally folks just to make this assumed so what happens when you start running a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis you start seeing massive rises in lactate ,1
inorganic phosphate and some other nasty byproducts but that's the thing you have to deal with I'd love for you to teach me how different ratios of fuel sources are used depending on how long I happen to be exercising for example if I do a very short bout of exercise yep typically that's correlated ,1
with a higher intensity output I mean I suppose I could jog for one minute but here I'm thinking about sprinting for one minute or less which fuels are used is that mainly driven by fat stores by carbohydrate stores is it driven by dietary fat preferentially or carbohydrate that I've ingested if indeed I've ingested those ,1
example the heart and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free you can bring in the oxygen attach it to that hydrogen make water and now you're right back to pyruvate you put two pyruvate back together and now you just make glucose so you can actually store it in the liver this is a process called gluconeogenesis through ,1
liver glycogen you start then having to pull in energy from another place so like as those numbers go down you'll see an increased uptick of energy from fat as well as protein having said that it's not a tremendous fuel source it is only aerobic so it has to be oxidized those are the same thing when I say oxidized ,1
you use oxygen to burn something to make a fuel um so it's not a significant contributor to energy in that regard and unless you're talking ultramarathons are longer and it is also not something that can enhance performance and so we don't really need to talk much more about it than that in terms of fat as a fuel ,1
can just wipe fat off the list it will never be your limiting factor to any type of endurance performance you simply have way too much the only problem with fat is is just too slow I've got to mobilize it I've got to get in the blood move it that whole thing too slow so if I want to go faster I will never be able to fully utilize fat which is why we ,1
they're not doing ketogenic diets for mental health reasons per se but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise or they tend to do a lot of long endurance but low intensity long endurance these are the I walk to get my exercise types and they do indeed walk a lot and some of them manage to control their weight very readily and like that ,1
which is speed times Force four strength and five hypertrophy today we're talking about the remaining adaptations on that list starting with muscular endurance followed by anaerobic capacity followed by maximal aerobic output and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise so if we could start with muscular ,1
you can repeat that a number of times but because remember the volume is fairly low the load is very very low you can actually repeat these quite frequently so you won't get extremely sore from muscular endurance relative to traditional hypertrophy straining because the load is very very light so you can do these more frequently if you ,1
would like more frequently such as you could do it three or four times a week easy if you would like you don't necessarily need to three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here um if you wanted to do more sets on a given day and do less days that would be fine so if you want to do two days a ,1
push-ups to Max duration and then also do that same workout before they do their high intensity interval training some other point during the week and then maybe even do it uh again um on their so-called rest day just a real quick five minutes of sure and in doing so build more capillaries into the relevant muscle groups and build their ,1
that you're going to do five times this is for world championship fights you get one minute break in between so imagine going like 30 on 30 off for five minutes getting a one minute break and doing that five times even though the individual ballots are 30 seconds long the entire thing lasts so long it is primarily aerobic ,1
applications you're going to be breathing because the nose is restricted right there's only so much space and as we talked about earlier the consequences of not having enough oxygen in or CO2 exhalation if you're restricting that this is going to be problematic so in your actual competition please go to the ,1
mouth if you need to right we practice a lot trying to stay nasal only for as long as possible but that's going to eventually happen when you're doing your high intensity intervals and you're really going as hard as you can you're going to have to go to your mouth unless you're an absolute Freakazoid and you can say in your nose but that's not ,1
have a worse performance rather than an injury rate so there's just a wonderful invention uh because of that where other things the consequences like say if you're going to be doing a barbell or kettlebell activity the consequences of making a technical mistake you might actually get an acute injury right there so they're just a little bit ,1
all out work that's pretty good so what that means for me is I would do three all out one minute sprints on one workout separated by a minute or two maybe more and I would do that two or three times per week just trying to hit that five or six ,1
actually do something as simple as like maybe you're going to do Farmer's carries and you'll do that for say three minutes and you'll set those down and you'll go straight into a plank for a minute and you'll pick that up and you go straight into maybe body weight squats for two minutes then you go straight into another exercise and you ,1
can sort of rotate things around maybe you can do even some like Shadow Boxing stuff or some jump rope you can do different gymnastics movements and body weight movements and you can run that thing through and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished and not feel like you're doing oh my gosh this mind-numbing type of training if it ,1
you're going to get fatigued that system right over time you have contracted contracted open up if that system starts to get fatigued you start running into failure here so you need to practice that and this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills to just simply training in this fashion there's all kinds of exercise devices for your ,1
lungs and when we say that that's what we're really talking about the musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue so that's the only other little component I wanted to throw in here if we're not talking about acid buffering which in this particular case is not a problem anymore ,1
the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed and to do it with better form and to breathe better and to feel better before during and after for those folks maybe you could spell out a program that combines these different elements of endurance and does so in a way that informs how for instance the higher intensity short ,1
endurance adaptations are and how to Foster those through specific protocols things that not only I can do tomorrow but that I will do tomorrow and where I hit my pain points I'll understand what's happening and the adaptation that I'm triggering when my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air through my mouth or I can calmly move along just through ,1
nasal breathing I will now know what's happening in my body and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering I think you also highlight something that is vitally important and I've never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today which is that it really doesn't matter how one seeks out to achieve fat loss provided certain criteria are met ,1
to go for distance so you're going to cover the exact same amount of distance you covered in round one which in this example is 400 meters and it doesn't matter how long it takes you it may take you two minutes and five seconds two minutes and 10 seconds because you're a little bit fatigued ,0
from round one round three you're gonna now come back and do that exact same time domain that you did in round two so if it took you two minutes and five seconds in round two now round three is going to last two minutes and five seconds and you want to see if you can cover a greater distance 405 meters 410 meters and then you did ,0
in round one and the beauty of this little protocol six minutes total of work right but if you slack in one of the rounds you just make the next round harder is there any rest between rounds yeah two minutes always two minutes rest you don't have to but this would be my recommendation ,0
Kenny king came up with this I don't know if he came up with it he taught me this thing we both know Kenny and he's an incredibly nice and Incredibly skilled trainer um I'm gonna call it the sugar cane yeah it's so great because it sounds really painful and if you go out too hard in round one you're in such big trouble round two but ,0
if you go to Easy in round one you're going to get absolutely obliterated in round three so it's like a wonderful thing and you can pick that number as a standardization and then just try to improve that a little bit per week so progression is the last part of this whole thing that we haven't got to yet before we move on ,0
um and the way you want to progress all of these things is you can time stamp again how much work you can do and then just try to do a slightly higher amount of work five percent or so every week or you can add a round which is a really nice way so um uh in the in the research studies ,0
that have been done they're going to do things like week one you'll do three rounds week two you'll do four rounds three you'll go five rounds you'll like add a round until you get up to say six or seven or eight rounds at the end of the protocol so that's a really nice way to go about it or you can cap the rounds and just try to get more work done in ,0
that same amount of time meaning go more intensely correct get you know get further distance in your 30 seconds or your 45 seconds or whatever um I want to encourage people to go as low as 20 seconds that's going to allow you to go very very fast that's going to actually challenge that phospho creatine piece a ,0
little bit I want to encourage people to also go as high as 90 seconds so the honest way the way that I will do it not that it's about me but just as an example of something you could do I do something in the 15 to 22nd burst range and I will generally hedge towards a two to one rest to work ratio so I'm probably going to rest 40 to 60 seconds ,0
that's true that's to make sure that 20 second burst is extremely high quality cool I'm also going to do something in the 30 to 50 second range okay I might go one-to-one work rest ratio the quality of those 30 seconds is going to come down but the acid buffering is going to be extraordinarily challenged ,0
I also will do that with a triple or quadruple rest range so again 30 seconds on maybe two minutes off now I won't be able to be I won't be working on my ability to handle um the waste product build up there but I'll be working on my ability to produce more force over that time which is another skill set and then all the way ,0
up to say what you do a minute 70 seconds and you can go one to one there or up to three to one um you're gonna be working on a little bit of this different thing but that's exactly how we hit both sides of this equation working on dealing with waste as well as actually working on bringing in nutrients and getting that system a ,0
little bit more effective so you could set that up across your week and just it could be something like day one is that 20 second burst window day two is that maybe 60 second window and then day three is maybe one all-out effort and we're done there let's talk about the specific protocols and adaptations ,0
related to maximum aerobic output or maximum aerobic capacity as it's sometimes called sure now we're moving past like that couple of minute range into like the you know five to 15 minute range but at a maximum intensity so what's the highest you can go from there we're not talking about our last category of long duration here well the ,0
beautiful part is we've already explained a lot of it because it's very similar to what we just talked about with anaerobic capacity it is primarily going to be a problem I'm dealing with waste products especially at the end it's not enough total distance to be running out of muscle glycogen though it may start to ,0
creep down a little bit Fat's not going to be an issue but certainly more oxygen transportation is going to be an issue so we're just hedging a little bit more towards that side of the equation towards the end of that workout no doubt about it clearing out waste products is going to be a huge issue but really oxygen demand delivery is ,0
starting to take more of a prominent role because we have had more time to clear the waste and if we're not good at that we're going to be failing earlier than we need so the training for that needs to be a little bit at that exact same so a classic thing here is a one mile ,0
test right this is going to last for most people somewhere between five and ten minutes you're sort of right in this window if you just want to practice that once a week we're done here right exercise Choice same thing we talked about right pick an exercise you're comfortable with that you can actually do and you can progressively increase in ,0
terms of the intensity um you're not going to be you don't have to stop and change your exercise you're not going to move around it's like a circuit isn't great here because you got to put one Implement down pick up another one you want to be doing something where there is literally not a second of off switch so similar exercise Choice principles we ,0
just covered if you gonna become a real Savage and you want to do repeats here you can um endurance folks will do that a lot one of my repeats 800 meter repeats things like that or I'm not sure what the swimming distance equivalents would be but swimmers we do this constantly but you don't need to ,0
this is really hard it's pretty hard in the system it's very good for you one to twice a week of hitting this I think you'll be in a really really good spot frequency we sort of just covered we covered exercise Choice volume we just sort of nailed and intensity is basically running you up to the top there now because you can only do that ,0
so often you want to add in another 40 or so percent of your time being lower intensity support work for that so this is something probably less than 85 percent of your heart rate but higher than quote unquote zone two you got to be working here this is not I could have a conversation Pace this is higher than that it's in between conversation pace ,0
and the pace I need to be at to run my fastest mile I've ever done that's that middle ground and you need to train that so that you can continue to work on capitalization auctioning Transportation but you're not burning down the house getting all the way up to 100 100 plus percent of your vo to Max could I use a uh accrued version of this ,0
where I say okay I'm going to exercise for 10 minutes I'm going to go as fast as I safely can and every week I'm going to measure how far I travel yep in that 10 minutes love it probably not on the same day that I'm doing the anaerobic capacity work ,0
probably not if you're probably okay to do after a strength training or hypertrophy workout as long as I didn't train legs you could um is probably going to compromise recovery is the way so I would if you're going to do a session like this I would probably do it on its own day unless you wanted ,0
to do something like speed or power then you could roll right into this and have no problem maybe a strength day a hypertrophy day I'm not sure um you would do there because again especially if you did any sort of lower body exercise you're going to be compromised here but remember these tend ,0
to be full body movements so even if you did arms that day your arms are going to be compromised and you don't want to fail this because of local muscular failure all right so now I've got my work cut out for me I'm going to be doing five to six minutes per week of all out work divided into 60 20 a 60 second ,0
bout with sufficient rest and I'm going to give myself 10 minutes a week of in my case it'll probably be running as fast as I can because I do enjoy running and I can do it safely um maybe uphill and see how far I go yep if you want to combine the two so if you're just saying hey I'm bought in Andy like I want to do both of these ,0
things they are similar but they have independent benefits I'm convinced how would I build these into the same week um maybe do one of each that still gets you at quote unquote two days per week where you're going to hit a hot maximum heart rate so we already checked that box off so one day can be a shorter length interval repeat one and the other ,0
one can simply be a 5 to 15 minute maximum work and you're done long duration endurance exercise the stereotypical endurance exercise sure how far how long how fast or how slow rather should I go and here I'm gonna Venture that exercise choice is one that we could click off even at this point in ,0
the discussion because obviously it's got to be something that I can do for a long while without getting injured uh overuse injuries um there's a little bit of novelty we can actually throw in here so one of the things I love to do for long duration and endurance for people who don't love running cycling or swimming ,0
is you can do a really cool workout any number of things where you can put a little circuit together as long as there's not a lot of downtime between one circuit to the next time you can actually do something as simple as like maybe you're going to do Farmer's carries and you'll do that for say three minutes and you'll set those ,0
down and you'll go straight into a plank for a minute and you'll pick that up and you go straight into maybe body weight squats for two minutes then you go straight into another exercise and you can sort of rotate things around maybe you can do even some like Shadow Boxing stuff or some jump rope you can do different gymnastics movements and body ,0
weight movements and you can run that thing through and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished and not feel like you're doing oh my gosh this mind-numbing type of training if it feels like that to you another way you can do that to actually even simplify it even more we've done this at Kenny Kane's gym plenty of times where you ,0
just maybe even pick three machines so you're gonna I'm gonna go 10 minutes on the rower then I'm gonna go 10 minutes on the treadmill and I'm gonna go 10 minutes on the bike you can actually knock a 30 minute quote-unquote steady state session out in and not feel those problems if those things happen so you can actually have a lot of fun there we ,0
will do a lot of times with our Fighters we'll do things like put a very low load I'm talking sub 50 of your max on a barbell and you're gonna Squat and you're gonna do you know maybe a minute you're gonna put that down and then you're gonna go over and do 50 of a bench press you're gonna put that down you're gonna go over and do 50 ,0
of uh of a crab walk and then you're gonna go over and do another one and you can actually run through this entire thing you don't hit that many reps in any individual movement the load is very very light and you can keep heart rate basically a steady state and do 15 or 20 or 30 different exercises and it's ,0
actually like fairly fun and engaging to do and it's a little bit more specific than trying to get a 275 pound NFL player to run for 30 minutes which is not going to be good so I'm just chuckling because I love to run outdoors and I've enjoyed runs on all my travels and I find it to be a great way to see different places and I like moving ,0
through space but there are weather conditions and times when that's not an option so what you described is a terrific alternative I have to assume that the specific adaptation that's occurring here is related to the fat burning system and again that doesn't necessarily mean fat loss correct overall but fat burning ,0
system and yet I do have a question which is can you build enhanced microcapillary systems into the muscles uh by doing this long duration cardio yeah absolutely can in fact depending on which paper you uh like more than the other papers you may even find evidence that this is a superior method than anything else a steady state endurance ,0
is very important I used to not like it as much there's just so much evidence now that suggests it's probably a really good thing for basically everybody maybe for some individuals it's not in all year of their training but if if you're not a high-level athlete or have a very specific goal that's right in front of ,0
you it's probably best to do at least 20 minutes as a minimum maybe 30 minutes of some steady state exercise once a week for basically any training goal outside of again a couple of really specific scenarios that are happening the other thing that kind of kicks in here that we haven't really talked about is now we're actually reaching a ,0
position where fatigue of the intercostal starts to play so diaphragmic fatigue starts to run an indication so we forget generally breathing is a contraction to open up the lungs to change pressure so the air will flow in and then the exhalation is passive right it's just a muscle's been stretched it goes back to it's resting ,0
when you get to a maximum heart rate inhalation and exhalation become active so you're squeezing as hard as you can to open up and you're squeezing to contract to blow air out you're going to get fatigued that system right over time you have contracted contracted open up if that system starts to get fatigued you start running into ,0
failure here so you need to practice that and this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills to just simply training in this fashion there's all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs and when we say that that's what we're really talking about the musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue so that's the only other ,0
little component I wanted to throw in here if we're not talking about acid buffering which in this particular case is not a problem anymore the time domain is long and slower so we have plenty of time to use fat as a fuel we also have plenty of time to use anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis and ,0
clear out waste products so we don't really see pH being a problem with this type of exercise you may start running low on liver glycogen if you're going a very long time muscle glycogen may start getting low but not really these are huge issues you're going to run into maybe a little bit of stroke volume issue but and the intensity is not high ,0
enough to become a problem you're more likely to break down posturally or breathing mechanics than really anything else unless again that duration really gets generally past two hours for most people so those are the things that are going to limit us so how do we improve it what do we train we went through the exercise choices you also need to make ,0
sure you're training your intercostals we need to be training our diaphragm in some fashion again it can be the exercise itself can be your normal training the thing you need to be careful of here and this is actually true for all the things we just talked about when we think about fatigue and we think ,0
about failure and endurance we really need to pay attention to technical breakdown that is always the marker we look for so when we when we go through our stuff with our athletes and they quote unquote fail or they finish that's generally because we saw a massive technical breakdown you're done like you're over ,0
there it's not always the case during all year round of the training but this is something to really pay attention to so if you're on that bike and you're 40 seconds in and all of a sudden posture starts punching over I may stop the test I may stop the training it's like no well we decided failure was is when you lost your Technique ,0
to some sufficient level so you want to pay attention to that too because that's going to determine your ability to perform well as well as maintain efficiency which is a really big problem here tell me if the protocol I'm about to describe would be a reasonable one for people to incorporate ,0
60 to 120 Minutes of long duration work per week so one way to accomplish that that I often use is to head out for a weight vested hike it's not a heavy weight vest it's maybe I think it's eight or ten pounds it's one of these ,0
thinner ones and if people don't have access to that you can bring a backpack with some items in it I mean it can be you don't even need external load it could just be your body okay great and and do some hiking at a at a fast enough clip that breathing harder than I would be if I just kind of shuffled along yeah I might stop here there drink some water ,0
no big deal but I can carry on a conversation if I need to so it's a Zone two-ish but probably pushing a little bit harder than that for that duration yeah not a lot of um deep soreness occurring after this maybe a little bit of achiness and some stabilization muscles that were used that may not be used Too Much ,0
especially if I've been sitting a lot during the week um kind of reminds me of how much I've been sitting but doing that all in one Long Afternoon um typically on a weekend or doing two shorter sessions throughout the week maybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes and then working up the progression to longer ,0
longer duration seems like that would be something that most people should be able to do yep and that it would weave in well with any resistance training or the uh anaerobic and aerobic output capacity work that we talked about just a moment ago great that's a fine version to do it if you want to go shorter and bring up the intensity a little bit so ,0
you want to keep it more to the 30 to 60 Minute range and go you know closer into the I can't have a conversation right now but again I'm not at a blistering heart rate um then you could probably get that same thing done in a smaller time window if that was a consideration so if you wanted to blend all three of these ,0
together you have a lot of wiggle room right so you could do something like order if we're talking about this type of training you could do this first and then finish with either one of the higher intensity stuff we talked about so it could be roped into the same thing ,0
it could be its own independent day it could be your sort of active recovery day it tends to be fairly restorative as you alluded to a little bit there so it's not that big a deal to do this on your quote-unquote off day if you're those if you're that type of person who like even on your off day you have to do ,0
something physical this is fine right if you wanted to do it on a lifting day especially if it's a power or strength date it's probably fine if you wanted to do it before the workout or after it either way you're probably okay probably best to do it after if the primary goal is one of the ,0
strength training adaptations if it's not if this is a primary goal do it first amazing if you wanted to do it in the combination with the other interval stuff you could do it fine there you could do it before or you could do it afterwards I actually have no problem doing it afterwards ,0
because that in effect especially if you say nasal only during this training will help the down regulation go and so you could finish that fairly well down regulated actually so it's kind of like a nice way to get thoroughly warmed up go really really hard and then give it a nice 20 to 30 minute slow back down and ,0
by the time you finish maybe even on a three minute walk nice slow nasal breathing four second inhale four seconds and yeah maybe five even play with the numbers a little bit then maybe you don't even need to do the down regulation breathing afterwards you'll be in a good spot what you wouldn't want ,0
to do this before do your intervals finish your intervals throw up lay on the ground sweat all over the gym floor get up and go back to work that's probably not our best strategy as people are hearing this all they may be thinking wow this is a lot of work to do but I've been keeping track of the math here as I'm sure some of you out ,0
there are as well and we're really talking about 10 minutes of the of running or sprinting on the bike or rower once a week we're talking about six minutes or so of the much higher intensity but short bouts divided into rounds of 20 to 20 seconds to a minute with with rest in between and then some longer duration ,0
work out of 30 minutes minimum but maybe as much as an hour even two hours which in total doesn't really equate to that much time especially if one can access these things right out their front door or at home and as we point out you don't need any specialized equipment to do that oh and I forgot the um muscular ,0
endurance that I wasn't trying to cheat there um some muscular endurance thrown in as well so that brings me to a question which is if I'm doing my training for muscular endurance each week for anaerobic capacity and for maximum aerobic output and long duration and given that all of ,0
that is going to take roughly two hours for the typical person total for the entire week which I would argue is going to give you back so much life literally in terms of longevity you're literally going to earn back years of your life productivity you name it offsetting all sorts of uh metabolic issues and uh enhancing your sleep and improving mood ,0
I mean there's so much data so much data pointing to all those positive benefits if I do all of these things and I'm fairly consistent about them am I going to be metabolically flexible am I going to have a well-developed fat burning carbohydrate burning system and will I be essentially fit I mean this is ,0
not leaving aside issues of strength and hypertrophy which were covered in the previous episode will I be fit I mean to my mind the ability to you know Sprint very fast if one needs to the ability to go longer duration if one needs to and the ability to do something in between as well as you know hold a box overhead if ,0
necessary while installing a shelf or something like that these are the realities of life and to me represent real functional World Fitness if that's the case is there anything that we would want to add to this program or would you consider that a fairly comprehensive and complete endurance training system if we remember the target which is I want to ,0
have energy I want to look a certain way and you want to be able to do that for the duration of your life for a very long life this style of training where you incorporate all of those areas of endurance gives you all of the necessary ,0
adaptations one would need to execute all of those things remember fat loss or Weight Management is not best done with any individual style of protocol so if you do a little bit of all three of these you've checked that fat loss box you don't need to go out and do anything separate for it you've done all the things then to cover ,0
Aesthetics from that side of the equation right you've done the things to both enhance mitochondria to enhance blood flow increase oxygenation and manage fatigue and waste development boom energy is there fatigue is there I'm not going to get tired or have to quit or stop or sit down doing ,0
any of these activities I want at the same time if you look at the literature on mortality one of the strongest predictors of how long you're going to live is your VO2 max so we've set up a scenario in which you're going to hit all three of those primary goals by doing a combination of this training you're not going to miss ,0
any plausible adaptation from endurance training and you should be set for regardless of your goal incredible and as I understand totally compatible with strength and hypertrophy training provided that your goal is to also be strong and also selectively hypertrophy or generally hypertrophy your muscles or ,0
maintain your muscles for many people that are listening to this I'm guessing that they have an interest in building more endurance but not just the ability to go further but the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed and to do it with better form and to breathe better and to feel better before during and after ,0
for those folks maybe you could spell out a program that combines these different elements of endurance and does so in a way that informs how for instance the higher intensity short duration Sprints would be expected to improve their longer duration work and how perhaps their longer duration work can progress if they are careful to ,0
include some planks and some wall sets and and things of that sort I asked this question specifically because I have to believe that while there probably are some folks out there they're looking to just maximize their plank from week to week to week typically it seems that people fall into these categories of either wanting to ,0
get stronger and get bigger muscles to varying degrees or to get better at endurance or to get better at everything overall right now I'd really like to just focus on what you think is a nice Contour of a program for the person that wants to get better at endurance but do it with more speed more stability and just feel like a strong endurance Runner ,0
cycle or swimmer or whatever happened to be their endurance event okay great so let's just give an example maybe you want to run your first half marathon something like that okay or maybe done a couple times before but you want to get better at that time I would probably put somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 to 70 percent of your you know mileage in ,0
the moderate intensity Zone okay so you need to accumulate mileage and you need to be able to handle what we call the tissue tolerance so in this case your feet need to be able to handle 13 miles of pounding okay it doesn't matter how much high heart rate training you do or your fat deliverability none of that matters if your feet are blown up by ,0
mile eight Okay so in addition we talked about how even training in that 70 to 85 percent heart rate zone is quite effective at oxygen delivery fat utilization capitalization Etc so you're going to get a lot of direct endurance benefits from that work you're also going to be working on what's honestly going to be one of your ,0
limiting factors which is that tissue tolerance and that pounding okay in addition you need to be efficient with your Technique and you need a lot of repetitions for motor skill development so you want to spend most your time there it's easy to recover from it's not extremely demanding and challenging awesome that ,0
leaves you with another 30 or 40 percent of training I would spend 10 percent of that in that like 20 second burst area you're going to drive up fatigue extremely high and you're going to really maximize your ability to recover from waste production all right great I would spend the remaining amount of time either on a little bit of actually ,0
maximum speed stuff that could actually be in the 20 second burst if you're really trying to go as fast as you can at the beginning of that exercise and then the rest of it I would spend in that other Zone which is more of like the five to 15 minutes but you're probably going to want to repeat those ,0
and this is when things like 800 meter run rest for double the time and then repeat that two or three times you actually need that in this scenario because you're gonna need to be able to be running for two most people are gonna do a half marathon and maybe around two hours or so something like that and so you want a little bit of what we call ,0
repeated endurance right so be able to handle that higher heart rate come back down do it again at the same time that's actually how you bump your mileage up so instead of having this do more of these long duration distance runs you can still get maybe five or six miles down in a day if you're going to do a one mile repeat ,0
or whatever number you're looking at so for a lot of people that's kind of how I would structure it um that's honestly it's very similar to what we laid out in the previous conversation which is getting to this idea that more than 50 percent should be basically practice a little bit of work at the very top end of the spectrum but not too much and ,0
then a little bit of work at the other end and you should be in a good spot a major mistake one would make here is only doing the long duration steady state stuff and just sort of saying I'm gonna run a five mile this was a week and then do six miles next week and seven I said that might work for you it's I think we have enough evidence at ,0
this point both in the scientific realm as well as most of the coaches I think in this space would agree with me is that's a sub-optimal strategy so it could work but we can do better and in terms of the structure of a program like this I realize that those structures vary tremendously different coaches and different books and different programs ,0
are going to say oh you should run Monday through Friday with weekends off or every other day but in terms of this 70 percent um thirty percent divide where seventy percent is going toward the specific event you know doing the kind of work that you're going to do during this specific event that you're most ,0
interested in cultivating or improving and the remaining 30 coming from other sorts of uh of supporting were work how should one thing about Distributing that other thirty percent should it be all geared towards maximizing recovery for the 70 or in other words um could I do all that 30 work on one day I probably would split it into two ,0
days um that's the reality is so if you're thinking man coach wants me to train six days a week my schedule is tight I can pull off four to five okay great what I might say is two of those days are just your your tempo right this is what like a runner would call this like Tempo training I'm kind ,0
of in that space remind us what tempo training is 80 effort range where you're like running at probably the same stride length and and rate that you're gonna run your race at maybe a little bit lower but something similar you're practicing skill you're accruing mileage and you're getting a little you're ,0
getting work in for sure work but it's not absolutely the fastest you can Sprint it's also not conversation so this would be the um what before we refer to as the 10 minutes of of fast running or ten minutes of fast run this is lower intensity than that got it this is uh this is work accumulation got it this is ,0
practice stuff um then one of the days a week I would probably enter in that 22nd 30 second burst for a little bit of speed there and then one of the other days is when I would do that true high intensity as hard as I can for hitting a VO2 max something like that so that's probably how I'd break it up if I had like four ,0
days a week if you had five you can maybe add in another day where you do more of that volume accumulation practice work but that's that's a pretty good split well this is the point in the episode where I say thank you ever so much you provided an enormous amount of incredibly interesting clear information that's ,0
also actionable I do feel as if I far better understand endurance in its many forms and even the seller underpinnings of that and even sub-seller underpinnings of what endurance adaptations are and how to Foster those through specific protocols things that not only I can do tomorrow but that I will do tomorrow and where I ,0
hit my pain points I'll understand what's happening and the adaptation that I'm triggering when my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air through my mouth or I can calmly move along just through nasal breathing I will now know what's happening in my body and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering I think you also highlight something that is ,0
vitally important and I've never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today which is that it really doesn't matter how one seeks out to achieve fat loss provided certain criteria are met even while certain forms of exercise tap into fat stores more than others and you beautifully Illustrated the relationship between energy utilization and breathing ,0
and the fact that we literally exhale fat to some extent of course so once again thank you thank you and thank you I know I'm not alone in um recognizing this information as incredibly interesting and actionable and indeed I do plan to put it into action as I hope many of our listeners will as well ,0
yet again the pleasure is actually all mine and uh I actually really appreciate the fact that you let me go so far into metabolism my PhD is in human bioenergetics so anytime I can go many hours into metabolism I get very excited and I don't typically get that leash um in this format so I appreciate that I know ,0
you understand your audience will love that hopefully Oh They'll love it and I think that they'll especially love it because they understand that if one can wrap their head around even just a small fraction of the mechanisms that underlie a given protocol it gives both tremendous depth and meaning to that protocol and makes it so much more ,0
flexible for people they can really think about what's happening as they're engaging in a given protocol and know exactly what they can expect in terms of results Great we've been on a bit of a journey here we've covered a lot of ground with speed development and strength and hypertrophy and now we walk through you know probably several hours ,0
here of of endurance what I would love to do next is to just give you a more straightforward not as much background not as much metabolism none of the mechanisms right into protocols for someone who says look I want to hit those marks you keep talking about I want to look good I want to feel good and I want to do that ,0
across my lifespan how would I build all these things into a protocol that actually covers maybe the entire year and how would I would be able to repeat that year after year so I almost have this Evergreen sustainable year-long periodization structure that covers all the nodes I need to if I want everything we've talked about in these nine ,0
