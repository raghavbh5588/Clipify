wearing them and where you happen to be you always see through them with Crystal Clarity the aesthetic of Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses is also worth mentioning unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there which only come in the kind of cyborg variety Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses come in those varieties but they also come in ,1
varieties that you would feel very comfortable wearing out to dinner or to work or to school really anywhere that you go if you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses you can go to Roka that's roka.com and enter the code huberman to save 20 off on your first order again that's Roca roka.com and enter the code huberman at checkout today's episode is ,1
waking up requires that one to three degree re- increase in body temperature I've been sleeping on an eight-sleep mattress cover for the last six months or so now and I can assert that it is the absolute biggest Game Changer in the quality and duration of my sleep in fact I don't really like traveling as much as I used to because the eight sleep ,1
doesn't go with me and they don't seem to have them yet in airbnbs and hotels so this is also a call to action airbnbs and hotels please put eight sleep mattresses on your beds and I'll be more apt to stay in those hotels and airbnbs with that said if you'd like to try an eight-sleep mattress cover you can go to eightsleep.com huberman check out the ,1
fact that you're a nurse surgeon do for your view of the brain how do you think about and conceptualize the brain yeah the scope of neurosurgery is quite broad uh when I was in medical school I I was drawn to neurosurgery because of a procedure known as deep brain stimulation when I was at Penn as a college student I actually watched my ,1
impulsive sometimes these problems actually melt away and we're trying to help their Tremor but the patients also tell us that their gambling issue has gotten better or their mood has improved and why is that well you know there's probably more than one reason you know you can help somebody's Mood by making ,1
their Tremor go away of course but we see laughter in the clinic sometimes and and why is that and that's because we're stimulating parts of the brain that are not just involved in these motor circuits but they're also involved in what we call a limbic circuit or part of the brain involved in emotion and if we learn how to modulate those areas ,1
used to hide in the back seat of the car in the closet to do it because it provided so much relief and then it eventually passed yes I wasn't medicated they never did anything about it every once in a while now if I'm very fatigued if I've been working a lot I notice it starts to come back I'll do this like kind of grunting and so it's been sort ,1
completely understandable uh I've been leading an Endeavor with a number of collaborators around the country to try to better understand these circuits in the brain uh study them in humans both invasively and non-invasively that would be with an electrode-based surgery sort of like we do at epilepsy to understand ,1
where seizures come from we want to understand better where obsessions come from but we're also working with imaging experts and geneticists to understand OCD at a broader level as well uh I I consider OCD to be a a spectrum disorder in a way uh and I I apologize to those who who might feel that I'm using that term incorrectly I'm using it ,1
patients but tricyclics and ssris can be very helpful and are definitely first line and there's others exposure response prevention is uh probably the most effective option which is kind of like cognitive behavioral therapy but these are different and offered by psychologists and this is a whole field and there's a a field or I should say a ,1
identified portions of the basal ganglia sure caudi putanum type structures in OCD and maybe some differences in boys versus girls so what brain areas are there sex differences in terms of OCD and were one to come into your clinic this you know for this sort of a work of ablations or stimulation uh where would you first ,1
problems and if you think about these problems I mean these are some of the most common conditions in our society today I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called ag-1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs I've been taking ,1
athletic green since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast the reason I started taking athletic greens and the reason I still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be in the probiotics that I need for gut health our gut is very important it's populated by gut microbiota that communicate with ,1
sneaking knock on Woods like in mid-exam and studying and pretty soon I was knocking on wood often I developed a superstition and so I'm curious about the role of superstition and compulsion in the crossover there it makes sense logically to me but I was equally shocked to learn that when I stopped taking this ,1
stimulant which I was quite happy to to stop because it did make me feel too alert couldn't sleep well Etc that the Superstition went away as well and I'm guessing this has something to do with some of the reward circuitry as it's called related to stimulants again I am not encouraging anyone to take ,1
I have a good friend who actually a famous neuroscientist I won't mention who it is who's worked very hard to suppress his his blinking tits and when he gets fatigued it comes back and and um he's very high functioning yes in his personal life and his professional life but but when you're talking to him and he starts doing this so you kind of ,1
stimulant you know I think I think your brain was very vulnerable to it you know you you sort of may have had a predisposition to it um you mentioned that you have you're a little obsessive and with the tick there maybe you have this kind of you know on the on the mild side of the spectrum OCD um and I I probably do as well by the ,1
understanding and a tailored treatment to the nucleus accumbens specifically we've learned in mice that if you expose a mouse now this is just a model if you expose a mouse to high fat food not food that they would normally eat food that is like 60 fat high fat it's like butter um we've learned that if you expose them to ,1
food like that within two weeks their nucleus accumbens is not functioning like a mouse that was never exposed to that high fat food there's aspects of it that are hyperactive I could say and there's aspects of it that are hypoactive or decreased activity but either way it's it's not functioning properly and most likely that function ,1
stimulation it's a a brief delivery of stimulation anywhere between 5 and 10 seconds that is intended to just disrupt the perturbed signaling that's happening in the nucleus accumbens there are disorders like depression let's say that I I would describe as a bit more of a state ,1
disorder and this is obviously oversimplified because we know that there's fluctuations in mood and depression as well so don't let me oversimplify it too much um but um but but for now let's forgive the oversimplification if we if we accept that depression is a state disorder or ,1
times a week um and in fact you know the patients that we're studying you know we've we've seen patients that lose control 20 30 times a week and that's probably the the term you have in mind when you're saying you're surprised that it's just one time a day and it's specifically related to the fact that these patients have to eat ,1
such a large amount of food in such a brief period of time um so it's hard to do that more than once a day I see um you mentioned that some pre-existing anxiety might bias somebody to have a binge I'm also fascinated by something I've observed before which was when I was in ,1
careful with their hands you're not going to see them doing heavy deadlifts you're not because of the way that impacts the motor neurons it's all about fine control yes um so if your neurosurgeon does heavy deadlifts you might want to consider getting a different neurosurgery I hope I didn't put anyone out of work there and then ,1
the other the other thing is that um you all are tend to be very calm people at least on the exterior we'll return to this later okay um but I do throw three or four questions out at once so so elevated autonomic arousal and alertness as well as decrease autonomic arousal and ,1
another stigma then there's the opposite in a way it's an opposite by the way for a phenotype standpoint is that anorexia I mean that's another stigma and you know gosh you know not to make this about one sex over another but when when girls are told they're pretty because they're thin it just reinforces this problem and of ,1
are very vulnerable and I think that will really help changing Society is hard and most of society is not you know ill meaning uh it's all done by accident um but that is the society that we live in so if we can try to improve that stigma uh and and be kinder to people in that way I think a lot of these problems would get better people that are obese ,1
by the way none of this has been published uh but I think it's so important for people to know this so I I am willing to share some aspects of what we're trying to do um but uh but that's that's really the first goal of this trial is to identify where the nucleus accumbens we can detect these craving cells so we have to ,1
provoke food craving in the operating room that's the first thing how do you do that ah well um there are some uh somewhat validated ways to do that so for example we asked patients to provide pictures of food that they rate very highly as something that they would typically crave and you know depending on the patient it might be something ,1
vulnerability is preceded by what we call a a moment of sort of pre-meal negative effect which basically means right before they binge they're feeling down or they feel stressed or anxious and they compensate for that momentary symptom by binging or losing control over food not everybody needs criteria ,1
exactly um you know with 0.5 millimeters of air so super precise uh or as precise as we think we need to be um and we use connectomics so there's a tool in brain Imaging called tractography where we can actually measure circuit connections it's it's an indirect assay but we believe it's ,1
powerful it has its uh assumptions but um like anything in in science but we could actually map out where the nucleus accumbens connects to the prefrontal cortex sort of the cortical control inhibitory control pathway and where that pathway intersects with the nucleus accumbens and we can Target that area ,1
um structurally so those three goals of the surgery we we aim to set up to accomplish and we believed if we achieved two of those three that we would have a successful result in our in our early trial amazing given that at least to me the non-clination that anorexia is the ,1
condition I I relate with that I am trying over time to bridge what I'm doing in obesity and binging disorder to atorexia for two reasons one because I think these problems are more similar than they are different and two because of the need um and I think we're well positioned to sort of tackle anorexia ,1
clinicians to stimulate specific brain areas perhaps with more Precision um maybe you could just give us a coverage of what those are being used for what are your thoughts on on um uh these forms of non-invasive meaning no no flipping open of a piece of the skull type brain stimulation and blockade of brain activity sure yeah I wanted to ,1
clarify also these these surgeries generally don't um by the way require a full craniotomy it's usually just a small opening about the size of a dime in the bone so just just to clarify but that's painless too right uh well usually without pain yeah there's a little bit of scalp numbing we give a scalp block and the patients are ,1
depression I believe is uh similar to what's been approved for uh OCD but for addiction I believe it is a different Target but we'd have to ask our our TMS experts on that can they direct the transcranial magnetic stimulation deep below the cortex they try uh and we're we're actually studying this in OCD patients now ,1
um I as a part of our invasive trial uh where we are trying to pull patients from a TMS trial that's in parallel to what we're doing um all funded by the foundation for OCD research where we believe we can use TMs to to define a circuit that if modulated improves OCD albeit temporarily and in ,1
um perhaps one day there will be a TMS Target for anorexia and obesity if we are scratching the surface with invasive approaches to these problems we we're even doing less with the brain stimulation um so we have so much work to do there eating disorders and TMS have been so um sort of scarcely studied or or there ,1
have been so such little research done in that in that space and so it is an area that we need to to work on um for the obvious reason for example in a patient with anorexia just thinking practically you know placing a device in a patient who is significantly underweight might not be the best approach you know wound erosion and ,1
incision I don't have to place an electrode into the brain to achieve a similar result how early into the pathology of Parkinson's can someone think about approaching this so for instance if somebody has a parent or a sibling and they're developing some resting Tremor yeah obviously they should talk to a neurologist but a ,1
um I actually sent a letter to Bill Clinton I I've observed uh Tremor in him and I think he's actually disclosed that he has it and I hoped he'd become a champion for for patients with a central Tremor um Sandra Day O'Connor does as well she's also public about it but I I was not able to get them eager to become ,1
without much regulation we've we've probed the brain um the problem we can't learn a lot from those experiments now uh well in this way at least we don't know exactly where those electrodes were we didn't have MRI scanning or high quality cat scanning to to know where those electrodes were with ,1
perhaps there becomes an ultrasound Target um but right now the approach is a bit more reversible because you can always shut that electrode off or even remove the electrode if perhaps it's not in the optimal location to treat the depression uh but actually after a large volume of cases perhaps they could pool that data ,1
levels of awareness at least for now until we have specific sites in the brain that we can Target non-invasive methods that could be deployed to millions and millions of people seems like that awareness seems like maybe among the best tools that people could develop yes 100 agree with you you know so for the person with OCD or uh who ,1
suffers from anorexia or binge eating disorder and to their clinicians you know I I just want to highlight that you said that I mean I'm not again I'm not a clinician I always say this I don't prescribe anything I profess things um and uh but awareness of one's thinking seems immensely powerful in this context yeah ,1
human novel study which I think will have a positive effect but it's still experimental uh they still can't stop themselves so there sort of as made aware as could possibly be did I use grammar there correctly I think so um they're as aware as they could possibly be and they still lose control ,1
we've had this studied in the lab so we will bring patients to the laboratory with this implanted device to to try to provoke this electrographic electrical signal that can be detected by the actual device that will stimulate them when they're at home but before we actually initiate stimulation we want us to see can this ,1
and even under video surveillance through a one day one-way mirror in a laboratory setting when patients are very well aware that their there to be studied if they're going to binge they still do and we believe they do because they just can't control it as aware as they are of it and it's probably because they're the ,1
